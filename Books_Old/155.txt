The reserve\r\nwhich I have hitherto maintained in this matter has been misinterpreted\r\nby members of my family whose good opinion I cannot consent to forfeit.\r\nI request them to suspend their decision until they have read my\r\nnarrative. And I declare, on my word of honour, that what I am now\r\nabout to write is, strictly and literally, the truth.\r\n\r\nThe private difference between my cousin and me took its rise in a\r\ngreat public event in which we were both concerned\xe2\x80\x94the storming of\r\nSeringapatam, under General Baird, on the 4th of May, 1799.\r\n\r\nIn order that the circumstances may be clearly understood, I must\r\nrevert for a moment to the period before the assault, and to the\r\nstories current in our camp of the treasure in jewels and gold stored\r\nup in the Palace of Seringapatam.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOne of the wildest of these stories related to a Yellow Diamond\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfamous gem in the native annals of India.\r\n\r\nThe earliest known traditions describe the stone as having been set in\r\nthe forehead of the four-handed Indian god who typifies the Moon.\r\nPartly from its peculiar colour, partly from a superstition which\r\nrepresented it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned,\r\nand growing and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the\r\nmoon, it first gained the name by which it continues to be known in\r\nIndia to this day\xe2\x80\x94the name of THE MOONSTONE. A similar superstition was\r\nonce prevalent, as I have heard, in ancient Greece and Rome; not\r\napplying, however (as in India), to a diamond devoted to the service of\r\na god, but to a semi-transparent stone of the inferior order of gems,\r\nsupposed to be affected by the lunar influences\xe2\x80\x94the moon, in this\r\nlatter case also, giving the name by which the stone is still known to\r\ncollectors in our own time.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the Yellow Diamond begin with the eleventh century of\r\nthe Christian era.\r\n\r\nAt that date, the Mohammedan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni, crossed\r\nIndia; seized on the holy city of Somnauth; and stripped of its\r\ntreasures the famous temple, which had stood for centuries\xe2\x80\x94the shrine\r\nof Hindoo pilgrimage, and the wonder of the Eastern world.\r\n\r\nOf all the deities worshipped in the temple, the moon-god alone escaped\r\nthe rapacity of the conquering Mohammedans. Preserved by three\r\nBrahmins, the inviolate deity, bearing the Yellow Diamond in its\r\nforehead, was removed by night, and was transported to the second of\r\nthe sacred cities of India\xe2\x80\x94the city of Benares.\r\n\r\nHere, in a new shrine\xe2\x80\x94in a hall inlaid with precious stones, under a\r\nroof supported by pillars of gold\xe2\x80\x94the moon-god was set up and\r\nworshipped. Here, on the night when the shrine was completed, Vishnu\r\nthe Preserver appeared to the three Brahmins in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe deity breathed the breath of his divinity on the Diamond in the\r\nforehead of the god. And the Brahmins knelt and hid their faces in\r\ntheir robes. The deity commanded that the Moonstone should be watched,\r\nfrom that time forth, by three priests in turn, night and day, to the\r\nend of the generations of men. And the Brahmins heard, and bowed before\r\nhis will. The deity predicted certain disaster to the presumptuous\r\nmortal who laid hands on the sacred gem, and to all of his house and\r\nname who received it after him. And the Brahmins caused the prophecy to\r\nbe written over the gates of the shrine in letters of gold.\r\n\r\nOne age followed another\xe2\x80\x94and still, generation after generation, the\r\nsuccessors of the three Brahmins watched their priceless Moonstone,\r\nnight and day. One age followed another until the first years of the\r\neighteenth Christian century saw the reign of Aurungzebe, Emperor of\r\nthe Moguls. At his command havoc and rapine were let loose once more\r\namong the temples of the worship of Brahmah. The shrine of the\r\nfour-handed god was polluted by the slaughter of sacred animals; the\r\nimages of the deities were broken in pieces; and the Moonstone was\r\nseized by an officer of rank in the army of Aurungzebe.\r\n\r\nPowerless to recover their lost treasure by open force, the three\r\nguardian priests followed and watched it in disguise. The generations\r\nsucceeded each other; the warrior who had committed the sacrilege\r\nperished miserably; the Moonstone passed (carrying its curse with it)\r\nfrom one lawless Mohammedan hand to another; and still, through all\r\nchances and changes, the successors of the three guardian priests kept\r\ntheir watch, waiting the day when the will of Vishnu the Preserver\r\nshould restore to them their sacred gem. Time rolled on from the first\r\nto the last years of the eighteenth Christian century. The Diamond fell\r\ninto the possession of Tippoo, Sultan of Seringapatam, who caused it to\r\nbe placed as an ornament in the handle of a dagger, and who commanded\r\nit to be kept among the choicest treasures of his armoury. Even then\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe palace of the Sultan himself\xe2\x80\x94the three guardian priests still kept\r\ntheir watch in secret. There were three officers of Tippoo\xe2\x80\x99s household,\r\nstrangers to the rest, who had won their master\xe2\x80\x99s confidence by\r\nconforming, or appearing to conform, to the Mussulman faith; and to\r\nthose three men report pointed as the three priests in disguise.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSo, as told in our camp, ran the fanciful story of the Moonstone. It\r\nmade no serious impression on any of us except my cousin\xe2\x80\x94whose love of\r\nthe marvellous induced him to believe it. On the night before the\r\nassault on Seringapatam, he was absurdly angry with me, and with\r\nothers, for treating the whole thing as a fable. A foolish wrangle\r\nfollowed; and Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky temper got the better of him. He\r\ndeclared, in his boastful way, that we should see the Diamond on his\r\nfinger, if the English army took Seringapatam. The sally was saluted by\r\na roar of laughter, and there, as we all thought that night, the thing\r\nended.\r\n\r\nLet me now take you on to the day of the assault.\r\n\r\nMy cousin and I were separated at the outset. I never saw him when we\r\nforded the river; when we planted the English flag in the first breach;\r\nwhen we crossed the ditch beyond; and, fighting every inch of our way,\r\nentered the town. It was only at dusk, when the place was ours, and\r\nafter General Baird himself had found the dead body of Tippoo under a\r\nheap of the slain, that Herncastle and I met.\r\n\r\nWe were each attached to a party sent out by the general\xe2\x80\x99s orders to\r\nprevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest. The\r\ncamp-followers committed deplorable excesses; and, worse still, the\r\nsoldiers found their way, by an unguarded door, into the treasury of the\r\nPalace, and loaded themselves with gold and jewels. It was in the court\r\noutside the treasury that my cousin and I met, to enforce the laws of\r\ndiscipline on our own soldiers. Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s fiery temper had been, as\r\nI could plainly see, exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible\r\nslaughter through which we had passed. He was very unfit, in my\r\nopinion, to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him.\r\n\r\nThere was riot and confusion enough in the treasury, but no violence\r\nthat I saw. The men (if I may use such an expression) disgraced\r\nthemselves good-humouredly. All sorts of rough jests and catchwords\r\nwere bandied about among them; and the story of the Diamond turned up\r\nagain unexpectedly, in the form of a mischievous joke. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s got the\r\nMoonstone?\xe2\x80\x9d was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the\r\nplundering, as soon as it was stopped in one place, to break out in\r\nanother. While I was still vainly trying to establish order, I heard a\r\nfrightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard, and at once ran\r\ntowards the cries, in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nI got to an open door, and saw the bodies of two Indians (by their\r\ndress, as I guessed, officers of the palace) lying across the entrance,\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nA cry inside hurried me into a room, which appeared to serve as an\r\narmoury. A third Indian, mortally wounded, was sinking at the feet of a\r\nman whose back was towards me. The man turned at the instant when I\r\ncame in, and I saw John Herncastle, with a torch in one hand, and a\r\ndagger dripping with blood in the other. A stone, set like a pommel, in\r\nthe end of the dagger\xe2\x80\x99s handle, flashed in the torchlight, as he turned\r\non me, like a gleam of fire. The dying Indian sank to his knees,\r\npointed to the dagger in Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and said, in his native\r\nlanguage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe spoke those words, and fell dead on the floor.\r\n\r\nBefore I could stir in the matter, the men who had followed me across\r\nthe courtyard crowded in. My cousin rushed to meet them, like a madman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear the room!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to me, \xe2\x80\x9cand set a guard on the door!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nmen fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his\r\ndagger. I put two sentinels of my own company, on whom I could rely, to\r\nkeep the door. Through the remainder of the night, I saw no more of my\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, the plunder still going on, General Baird\r\nannounced publicly by beat of drum, that any thief detected in the\r\nfact, be he whom he might, should be hung. The provost-marshal was in\r\nattendance, to prove that the General was in earnest; and in the throng\r\nthat followed the proclamation, Herncastle and I met again.\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand, as usual, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI waited before I gave him my hand in return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me first,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9chow the Indian in the armoury met his death,\r\nand what those last words meant, when he pointed to the dagger in your\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian met his death, as I suppose, by a mortal wound,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerncastle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat his last words meant I know no more than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him narrowly. His frenzy of the previous day had all calmed\r\ndown. I determined to give him another chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all you have to tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned my back on him; and we have not spoken since.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI beg it to be understood that what I write here about my cousin\r\n(unless some necessity should arise for making it public) is for the\r\ninformation of the family only. Herncastle has said nothing that can\r\njustify me in speaking to our commanding officer. He has been taunted\r\nmore than once about the Diamond, by those who recollect his angry\r\noutbreak before the assault; but, as may easily be imagined, his own\r\nremembrance of the circumstances under which I surprised him in the\r\narmoury has been enough to keep him silent. It is reported that he\r\nmeans to exchange into another regiment, avowedly for the purpose of\r\nseparating himself from _me_.\r\n\r\nWhether this be true or not, I cannot prevail upon myself to become his\r\naccuser\xe2\x80\x94and I think with good reason. If I made the matter public, I\r\nhave no evidence but moral evidence to bring forward. I have not only\r\nno proof that he killed the two men at the door; I cannot even declare\r\nthat he killed the third man inside\xe2\x80\x94for I cannot say that my own eyes\r\nsaw the deed committed. It is true that I heard the dying Indian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords; but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of\r\ndelirium, how could I contradict the assertion from my own knowledge?\r\nLet our relatives, on either side, form their own opinion on what I\r\nhave written, and decide for themselves whether the aversion I now feel\r\ntowards this man is well or ill founded.\r\n\r\nAlthough I attach no sort of credit to the fantastic Indian legend of\r\nthe gem, I must acknowledge, before I conclude, that I am influenced by\r\na certain superstition of my own in this matter. It is my conviction,\r\nor my delusion, no matter which, that crime brings its own fatality\r\nwith it. I am not only persuaded of Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s guilt; I am even\r\nfanciful enough to believe that he will live to regret it, if he keeps\r\nthe Diamond; and that others will live to regret taking it from him, if\r\nhe gives the Diamond away.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\n THE LOSS OF THE DIAMOND (1848)\r\n\r\n_The Events related by Gabriel Betteredge, house-steward in the service\r\nof Julia, Lady Verinder._\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIn the first part of _Robinson Crusoe_, at page one hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine, you will find it thus written:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I saw, though too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we\r\ncount the Cost, and before we judge rightly of our own Strength to go\r\nthrough with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday, I opened my _Robinson Crusoe_ at that place. Only this\r\nmorning (May twenty-first, eighteen hundred and fifty), came my lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnephew, Mr. Franklin Blake, and held a short conversation with me, as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s about\r\nsome family matters; and, among other things, we have been talking of\r\nthe loss of the Indian Diamond, in my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house in Yorkshire, two\r\nyears since. Mr. Bruff thinks as I think, that the whole story ought,\r\nin the interests of truth, to be placed on record in writing\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nsooner the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot perceiving his drift yet, and thinking it always desirable for the\r\nsake of peace and quietness to be on the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s side, I said I\r\nthought so too. Mr. Franklin went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this matter of the Diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe characters of innocent\r\npeople have suffered under suspicion already\xe2\x80\x94as you know. The memories\r\nof innocent people may suffer, hereafter, for want of a record of the\r\nfacts to which those who come after us can appeal. There can be no\r\ndoubt that this strange family story of ours ought to be told. And I\r\nthink, Betteredge, Mr. Bruff and I together have hit on the right way\r\nof telling it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery satisfactory to both of them, no doubt. But I failed to see what I\r\nmyself had to do with it, so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have certain events to relate,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin proceeded; \xe2\x80\x9cand we\r\nhave certain persons concerned in those events who are capable of\r\nrelating them. Starting from these plain facts, the idea is that we\r\nshould all write the story of the Moonstone in turn\xe2\x80\x94as far as our own\r\npersonal experience extends, and no farther. We must begin by showing\r\nhow the Diamond first fell into the hands of my uncle Herncastle, when\r\nhe was serving in India fifty years since. This prefatory narrative I\r\nhave already got by me in the form of an old family paper, which\r\nrelates the necessary particulars on the authority of an eye-witness.\r\nThe next thing to do is to tell how the Diamond found its way into my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s house in Yorkshire, two years ago, and how it came to be lost in\r\nlittle more than twelve hours afterwards. Nobody knows as much as you\r\ndo, Betteredge, about what went on in the house at that time. So you\r\nmust take the pen in hand, and start the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those terms I was informed of what my personal concern was with the\r\nmatter of the Diamond. If you are curious to know what course I took\r\nunder the circumstances, I beg to inform you that I did what you would\r\nprobably have done in my place. I modestly declared myself to be quite\r\nunequal to the task imposed upon me\xe2\x80\x94and I privately felt, all the time,\r\nthat I was quite clever enough to perform it, if I only gave my own\r\nabilities a fair chance. Mr. Franklin, I imagine, must have seen my\r\nprivate sentiments in my face. He declined to believe in my modesty;\r\nand he insisted on giving my abilities a fair chance.\r\n\r\nTwo hours have passed since Mr. Franklin left me. As soon as his back\r\nwas turned, I went to my writing-desk to start the story. There I have\r\nsat helpless (in spite of my abilities) ever since; seeing what\r\nRobinson Crusoe saw, as quoted above\xe2\x80\x94namely, the folly of beginning a\r\nwork before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own\r\nstrength to go through with it. Please to remember, I opened the book\r\nby accident, at that bit, only the day before I rashly undertook the\r\nbusiness now in hand; and, allow me to ask\xe2\x80\x94if _that_ isn\xe2\x80\x99t prophecy,\r\nwhat is?\r\n\r\nI am not superstitious; I have read a heap of books in my time; I am a\r\nscholar in my own way. Though turned seventy, I possess an active\r\nmemory, and legs to correspond. You are not to take it, if you please,\r\nas the saying of an ignorant man, when I express my opinion that such a\r\nbook as _Robinson Crusoe_ never was written, and never will be written\r\nagain. I have tried that book for years\xe2\x80\x94generally in combination with a\r\npipe of tobacco\xe2\x80\x94and I have found it my friend in need in all the\r\nnecessities of this mortal life. When my spirits are bad\xe2\x80\x94_Robinson\r\nCrusoe_. When I want advice\xe2\x80\x94_Robinson Crusoe_. In past times when my\r\nwife plagued me; in present times when I have had a drop too\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94_Robinson Crusoe_. I have worn out six stout _Robinson Crusoes_\r\nwith hard work in my service. On my lady\xe2\x80\x99s last birthday she gave me a\r\nseventh. I took a drop too much on the strength of it; and _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_ put me right again. Price four shillings and sixpence, bound in\r\nblue, with a picture into the bargain.\r\n\r\nStill, this don\xe2\x80\x99t look much like starting the story of the Diamond\xe2\x80\x94does\r\nit? I seem to be wandering off in search of Lord knows what, Lord knows\r\nwhere. We will take a new sheet of paper, if you please, and begin over\r\nagain, with my best respects to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nI spoke of my lady a line or two back. Now the Diamond could never have\r\nbeen in our house, where it was lost, if it had not been made a present\r\nof to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter; and my lady\xe2\x80\x99s daughter would never have been\r\nin existence to have the present, if it had not been for my lady who\r\n(with pain and travail) produced her into the world. Consequently, if\r\nwe begin with my lady, we are pretty sure of beginning far enough back.\r\nAnd that, let me tell you, when you have got such a job as mine in\r\nhand, is a real comfort at starting.\r\n\r\nIf you know anything of the fashionable world, you have heard tell of\r\nthe three beautiful Miss Herncastles. Miss Adelaide; Miss Caroline; and\r\nMiss Julia\xe2\x80\x94this last being the youngest and the best of the three\r\nsisters, in my opinion; and I had opportunities of judging, as you\r\nshall presently see. I went into the service of the old lord, their\r\nfather (thank God, we have got nothing to do with him, in this business\r\nof the Diamond; he had the longest tongue and the shortest temper of\r\nany man, high or low, I ever met with)\xe2\x80\x94I say, I went into the service\r\nof the old lord, as page-boy in waiting on the three honourable young\r\nladies, at the age of fifteen years. There I lived till Miss Julia\r\nmarried the late Sir John Verinder. An excellent man, who only wanted\r\nsomebody to manage him; and, between ourselves, he found somebody to do\r\nit; and what is more, he throve on it and grew fat on it, and lived\r\nhappy and died easy on it, dating from the day when my lady took him to\r\nchurch to be married, to the day when she relieved him of his last\r\nbreath, and closed his eyes for ever.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to state that I went with the bride to the bride\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s house and lands down here. \xe2\x80\x9cSir John,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nwithout Gabriel Betteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sir John, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nwithout him, either.\xe2\x80\x9d That was his way with her\xe2\x80\x94and that was how I went\r\ninto his service. It was all one to me where I went, so long as my\r\nmistress and I were together.\r\n\r\nSeeing that my lady took an interest in the out-of-door work, and the\r\nfarms, and such like, I took an interest in them too\xe2\x80\x94with all the more\r\nreason that I was a small farmer\xe2\x80\x99s seventh son myself. My lady got me\r\nput under the bailiff, and I did my best, and gave satisfaction, and\r\ngot promotion accordingly. Some years later, on the Monday as it might\r\nbe, my lady says, \xe2\x80\x9cSir John, your bailiff is a stupid old man. Pension\r\nhim liberally, and let Gabriel Betteredge have his place.\xe2\x80\x9d On the\r\nTuesday as it might be, Sir John says, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady, the bailiff is\r\npensioned liberally; and Gabriel Betteredge has got his place.\xe2\x80\x9d You\r\nhear more than enough of married people living together miserably. Here\r\nis an example to the contrary. Let it be a warning to some of you, and\r\nan encouragement to others. In the meantime, I will go on with my\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nWell, there I was in clover, you will say. Placed in a position of\r\ntrust and honour, with a little cottage of my own to live in, with my\r\nrounds on the estate to occupy me in the morning, and my accounts in\r\nthe afternoon, and my pipe and my _Robinson Crusoe_ in the evening\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nmore could I possibly want to make me happy? Remember what Adam wanted\r\nwhen he was alone in the Garden of Eden; and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t blame it in\r\nAdam, don\xe2\x80\x99t blame it in me.\r\n\r\nThe woman I fixed my eye on, was the woman who kept house for me at my\r\ncottage. Her name was Selina Goby. I agree with the late William\r\nCobbett about picking a wife. See that she chews her food well and sets\r\nher foot down firmly on the ground when she walks, and you\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nright. Selina Goby was all right in both these respects, which was one\r\nreason for marrying her. I had another reason, likewise, entirely of my\r\nown discovering. Selina, being a single woman, made me pay so much a\r\nweek for her board and services. Selina, being my wife, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t charge\r\nfor her board, and would have to give me her services for nothing. That\r\nwas the point of view I looked at it from. Economy\xe2\x80\x94with a dash of love.\r\nI put it to my mistress, as in duty bound, just as I had put it to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been turning Selina Goby over in my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nthink, my lady, it will be cheaper to marry her than to keep her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady burst out laughing, and said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which to be most\r\nshocked at\xe2\x80\x94my language or my principles. Some joke tickled her, I\r\nsuppose, of the sort that you can\xe2\x80\x99t take unless you are a person of\r\nquality. Understanding nothing myself but that I was free to put it\r\nnext to Selina, I went and put it accordingly. And what did Selina say?\r\nLord! how little you must know of women, if you ask that. Of course she\r\nsaid, Yes.\r\n\r\nAs my time drew nearer, and there got to be talk of my having a new\r\ncoat for the ceremony, my mind began to misgive me. I have compared\r\nnotes with other men as to what they felt while they were in my\r\ninteresting situation; and they have all acknowledged that, about a\r\nweek before it happened, they privately wished themselves out of it. I\r\nwent a trifle further than that myself; I actually rose up, as it were,\r\nand tried to get out of it. Not for nothing! I was too just a man to\r\nexpect she would let me off for nothing. Compensation to the woman when\r\nthe man gets out of it, is one of the laws of England. In obedience to\r\nthe laws, and after turning it over carefully in my mind, I offered\r\nSelina Goby a feather-bed and fifty shillings to be off the bargain.\r\nYou will hardly believe it, but it is nevertheless true\xe2\x80\x94she was fool\r\nenough to refuse.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was all over with me, of course. I got the new coat as\r\ncheap as I could, and I went through all the rest of it as cheap as I\r\ncould. We were not a happy couple, and not a miserable couple. We were\r\nsix of one and half-a-dozen of the other. How it was I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand, but we always seemed to be getting, with the best of\r\nmotives, in one another\xe2\x80\x99s way. When I wanted to go upstairs, there was\r\nmy wife coming down; or when my wife wanted to go down, there was I\r\ncoming up. That is married life, according to my experience of it.\r\n\r\nAfter five years of misunderstandings on the stairs, it pleased an\r\nall-wise Providence to relieve us of each other by taking my wife. I\r\nwas left with my little girl Penelope, and with no other child. Shortly\r\nafterwards Sir John died, and my lady was left with her little girl,\r\nMiss Rachel, and no other child. I have written to very poor purpose of\r\nmy lady, if you require to be told that my little Penelope was taken\r\ncare of, under my good mistress\xe2\x80\x99s own eye, and was sent to school and\r\ntaught, and made a sharp girl, and promoted, when old enough, to be\r\nMiss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s own maid.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I went on with my business as bailiff year after year up to\r\nChristmas 1847, when there came a change in my life. On that day, my\r\nlady invited herself to a cup of tea alone with me in my cottage. She\r\nremarked that, reckoning from the year when I started as page-boy in\r\nthe time of the old lord, I had been more than fifty years in her\r\nservice, and she put into my hands a beautiful waistcoat of wool that\r\nshe had worked herself, to keep me warm in the bitter winter weather.\r\n\r\nI received this magnificent present quite at a loss to find words to\r\nthank my mistress with for the honour she had done me. To my great\r\nastonishment, it turned out, however, that the waistcoat was not an\r\nhonour, but a bribe. My lady had discovered that I was getting old\r\nbefore I had discovered it myself, and she had come to my cottage to\r\nwheedle me (if I may use such an expression) into giving up my hard\r\nout-of-door work as bailiff, and taking my ease for the rest of my days\r\nas steward in the house. I made as good a fight of it against the\r\nindignity of taking my ease as I could. But my mistress knew the weak\r\nside of me; she put it as a favour to herself. The dispute between us\r\nended, after that, in my wiping my eyes, like an old fool, with my new\r\nwoollen waistcoat, and saying I would think about it.\r\n\r\nThe perturbation in my mind, in regard to thinking about it, being\r\ntruly dreadful after my lady had gone away, I applied the remedy which\r\nI have never yet found to fail me in cases of doubt and emergency. I\r\nsmoked a pipe and took a turn at _Robinson Crusoe_. Before I had\r\noccupied myself with that extraordinary book five minutes, I came on a\r\ncomforting bit (page one hundred and fifty-eight), as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cToday\r\nwe love, what tomorrow we hate.\xe2\x80\x9d I saw my way clear directly. Today I\r\nwas all for continuing to be farm-bailiff; tomorrow, on the authority\r\nof _Robinson Crusoe_, I should be all the other way. Take myself\r\ntomorrow while in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s humour, and the thing was done. My mind\r\nbeing relieved in this manner, I went to sleep that night in the\r\ncharacter of Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s farm-bailiff, and I woke up the next\r\nmorning in the character of Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house-steward. All quite\r\ncomfortable, and all through _Robinson Crusoe_!\r\n\r\nMy daughter Penelope has just looked over my shoulder to see what I\r\nhave done so far. She remarks that it is beautifully written, and every\r\nword of it true. But she points out one objection. She says what I have\r\ndone so far isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least what I was wanted to do. I am asked to\r\ntell the story of the Diamond and, instead of that, I have been telling\r\nthe story of my own self. Curious, and quite beyond me to account for.\r\nI wonder whether the gentlemen who make a business and a living out of\r\nwriting books, ever find their own selves getting in the way of their\r\nsubjects, like me? If they do, I can feel for them. In the meantime,\r\nhere is another false start, and more waste of good writing-paper.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done now? Nothing that I know of, except for you to keep\r\nyour temper, and for me to begin it all over again for the third time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe question of how I am to start the story properly I have tried to\r\nsettle in two ways. First, by scratching my head, which led to nothing.\r\nSecond, by consulting my daughter Penelope, which has resulted in an\r\nentirely new idea.\r\n\r\nPenelope\xe2\x80\x99s notion is that I should set down what happened, regularly\r\nday by day, beginning with the day when we got the news that Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake was expected on a visit to the house. When you come to\r\nfix your memory with a date in this way, it is wonderful what your\r\nmemory will pick up for you upon that compulsion. The only difficulty\r\nis to fetch out the dates, in the first place. This Penelope offers to\r\ndo for me by looking into her own diary, which she was taught to keep\r\nwhen she was at school, and which she has gone on keeping ever since.\r\nIn answer to an improvement on this notion, devised by myself, namely,\r\nthat she should tell the story instead of me, out of her own diary,\r\nPenelope observes, with a fierce look and a red face, that her journal\r\nis for her own private eye, and that no living creature shall ever know\r\nwhat is in it but herself. When I inquire what this means, Penelope\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cFiddlesticks!\xe2\x80\x9d I say, Sweethearts.\r\n\r\nBeginning, then, on Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s plan, I beg to mention that I was\r\nspecially called one Wednesday morning into my lady\xe2\x80\x99s own sitting-room,\r\nthe date being the twenty-fourth of May, eighteen hundred and\r\nforty-eight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, \xe2\x80\x9chere is news that will surprise you. Franklin\r\nBlake has come back from abroad. He has been staying with his father in\r\nLondon, and he is coming to us tomorrow to stop till next month, and\r\nkeep Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf I had had a hat in my hand, nothing but respect would have prevented\r\nme from throwing that hat up to the ceiling. I had not seen Mr.\r\nFranklin since he was a boy, living along with us in this house. He\r\nwas, out of all sight (as I remember him), the nicest boy that ever\r\nspun a top or broke a window. Miss Rachel, who was present, and to whom\r\nI made that remark, observed, in return, that _she_ remembered him as\r\nthe most atrocious tyrant that ever tortured a doll, and the hardest\r\ndriver of an exhausted little girl in string harness that England could\r\nproduce. \xe2\x80\x9cI burn with indignation, and I ache with fatigue,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nway Miss Rachel summed it up, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I think of Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing what I now tell you, you will naturally ask how it was that Mr.\r\nFranklin should have passed all the years, from the time when he was a\r\nboy to the time when he was a man, out of his own country. I answer,\r\nbecause his father had the misfortune to be next heir to a Dukedom, and\r\nnot to be able to prove it.\r\n\r\nIn two words, this was how the thing happened:\r\n\r\nMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s eldest sister married the celebrated Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x94equally famous\r\nfor his great riches, and his great suit at law. How many years he went\r\non worrying the tribunals of his country to turn out the Duke in\r\npossession, and to put himself in the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s place\xe2\x80\x94how many lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurses he filled to bursting, and how many otherwise harmless people he\r\nset by the ears together disputing whether he was right or wrong\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nmore by a great deal than I can reckon up. His wife died, and two of\r\nhis three children died, before the tribunals could make up their minds\r\nto show him the door and take no more of his money. When it was all\r\nover, and the Duke in possession was left in possession, Mr. Blake\r\ndiscovered that the only way of being even with his country for the\r\nmanner in which it had treated him, was not to let his country have the\r\nhonour of educating his son. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I trust my native institutions,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas the form in which he put it, \xe2\x80\x9cafter the way in which my native\r\ninstitutions have behaved to _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d Add to this, that Mr. Blake\r\ndisliked all boys, his own included, and you will admit that it could\r\nonly end in one way. Master Franklin was taken from us in England, and\r\nwas sent to institutions which his father _could_ trust, in that\r\nsuperior country, Germany; Mr. Blake himself, you will observe,\r\nremaining snug in England, to improve his fellow-countrymen in the\r\nParliament House, and to publish a statement on the subject of the Duke\r\nin possession, which has remained an unfinished statement from that day\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nThere! thank God, that\xe2\x80\x99s told! Neither you nor I need trouble our heads\r\nany more about Mr. Blake, senior. Leave him to the Dukedom; and let you\r\nand I stick to the Diamond.\r\n\r\nThe Diamond takes us back to Mr. Franklin, who was the innocent means\r\nof bringing that unlucky jewel into the house.\r\n\r\nOur nice boy didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget us after he went abroad. He wrote every now\r\nand then; sometimes to my lady, sometimes to Miss Rachel, and sometimes\r\nto me. We had had a transaction together, before he left, which\r\nconsisted in his borrowing of me a ball of string, a four-bladed knife,\r\nand seven-and-sixpence in money\xe2\x80\x94the colour of which last I have not\r\nseen, and never expect to see again. His letters to me chiefly related\r\nto borrowing more. I heard, however, from my lady, how he got on\r\nabroad, as he grew in years and stature. After he had learnt what the\r\ninstitutions of Germany could teach him, he gave the French a turn\r\nnext, and the Italians a turn after that. They made him among them a\r\nsort of universal genius, as well as I could understand it. He wrote a\r\nlittle; he painted a little; he sang and played and composed a\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x94borrowing, as I suspect, in all these cases, just as he had\r\nborrowed from me. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune (seven hundred a year) fell to\r\nhim when he came of age, and ran through him, as it might be through a\r\nsieve. The more money he had, the more he wanted; there was a hole in\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s pocket that nothing would sew up. Wherever he went, the\r\nlively, easy way of him made him welcome. He lived here, there, and\r\neverywhere; his address (as he used to put it himself) being \xe2\x80\x9cPost\r\nOffice, Europe\xe2\x80\x94to be left till called for.\xe2\x80\x9d Twice over, he made up his\r\nmind to come back to England and see us; and twice over (saving your\r\npresence), some unmentionable woman stood in the way and stopped him.\r\nHis third attempt succeeded, as you know already from what my lady told\r\nme. On Thursday the twenty-fifth of May, we were to see for the first\r\ntime what our nice boy had grown to be as a man. He came of good blood;\r\nhe had a high courage; and he was five-and-twenty years of age, by our\r\nreckoning. Now you know as much of Mr. Franklin Blake as I did\xe2\x80\x94before\r\nMr. Franklin Blake came down to our house.\r\n\r\nThe Thursday was as fine a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day as ever you saw: and my lady\r\nand Miss Rachel (not expecting Mr. Franklin till dinner-time) drove out\r\nto lunch with some friends in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone, I went and had a look at the bedroom which had\r\nbeen got ready for our guest, and saw that all was straight. Then,\r\nbeing butler in my lady\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, as well as steward (at my own\r\nparticular request, mind, and because it vexed me to see anybody but\r\nmyself in possession of the key of the late Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s cellar)\xe2\x80\x94then, I\r\nsay, I fetched up some of our famous Latour claret, and set it in the\r\nwarm summer air to take off the chill before dinner. Concluding to set\r\nmyself in the warm summer air next\xe2\x80\x94seeing that what is good for old\r\nclaret is equally good for old age\xe2\x80\x94I took up my beehive chair to go out\r\ninto the back court, when I was stopped by hearing a sound like the\r\nsoft beating of a drum, on the terrace in front of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\n\r\nGoing round to the terrace, I found three mahogany-coloured Indians, in\r\nwhite linen frocks and trousers, looking up at the house.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, as I saw on looking closer, had small hand-drums slung in\r\nfront of them. Behind them stood a little delicate-looking light-haired\r\nEnglish boy carrying a bag. I judged the fellows to be strolling\r\nconjurors, and the boy with the bag to be carrying the tools of their\r\ntrade. One of the three, who spoke English and who exhibited, I must\r\nown, the most elegant manners, presently informed me that my judgment\r\nwas right. He requested permission to show his tricks in the presence\r\nof the lady of the house.\r\n\r\nNow I am not a sour old man. I am generally all for amusement, and the\r\nlast person in the world to distrust another person because he happens\r\nto be a few shades darker than myself. But the best of us have our\r\nweaknesses\xe2\x80\x94and my weakness, when I know a family plate-basket to be out\r\non a pantry-table, is to be instantly reminded of that basket by the\r\nsight of a strolling stranger whose manners are superior to my own. I\r\naccordingly informed the Indian that the lady of the house was out; and\r\nI warned him and his party off the premises. He made me a beautiful bow\r\nin return; and he and his party went off the premises. On my side, I\r\nreturned to my beehive chair, and set myself down on the sunny side of\r\nthe court, and fell (if the truth must be owned), not exactly into a\r\nsleep, but into the next best thing to it.\r\n\r\nI was roused up by my daughter Penelope running out at me as if the\r\nhouse was on fire. What do you think she wanted? She wanted to have the\r\nthree Indian jugglers instantly taken up; for this reason, namely, that\r\nthey knew who was coming from London to visit us, and that they meant\r\nsome mischief to Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s name roused me. I opened my eyes, and made my girl\r\nexplain herself.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Penelope had just come from our lodge, where she had\r\nbeen having a gossip with the lodge-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. The two girls\r\nhad seen the Indians pass out, after I had warned them off, followed by\r\ntheir little boy. Taking it into their heads that the boy was ill-used\r\nby the foreigners\xe2\x80\x94for no reason that I could discover, except that he\r\nwas pretty and delicate-looking\xe2\x80\x94the two girls had stolen along the\r\ninner side of the hedge between us and the road, and had watched the\r\nproceedings of the foreigners on the outer side. Those proceedings\r\nresulted in the performance of the following extraordinary tricks.\r\n\r\nThey first looked up the road, and down the road, and made sure that\r\nthey were alone. Then they all three faced about, and stared hard in\r\nthe direction of our house. Then they jabbered and disputed in their\r\nown language, and looked at each other like men in doubt. Then they all\r\nturned to their little English boy, as if they expected _him_ to help\r\nthem. And then the chief Indian, who spoke English, said to the boy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold out your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing those dreadful words, my daughter Penelope said she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what prevented her heart from flying straight out of her. I\r\nthought privately that it might have been her stays. All I said,\r\nhowever, was, \xe2\x80\x9cYou make my flesh creep.\xe2\x80\x9d (_Nota bene:_ Women like these\r\nlittle compliments.)\r\n\r\nWell, when the Indian said, \xe2\x80\x9cHold out your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d the boy shrunk back,\r\nand shook his head, and said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. The Indian, thereupon,\r\nasked him (not at all unkindly), whether he would like to be sent back\r\nto London, and left where they had found him, sleeping in an empty\r\nbasket in a market\xe2\x80\x94a hungry, ragged, and forsaken little boy. This, it\r\nseems, ended the difficulty. The little chap unwillingly held out his\r\nhand. Upon that, the Indian took a bottle from his bosom, and poured\r\nout of it some black stuff, like ink, into the palm of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\nThe Indian\xe2\x80\x94first touching the boy\xe2\x80\x99s head, and making signs over it in\r\nthe air\xe2\x80\x94then said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy became quite stiff, and stood like a\r\nstatue, looking into the ink in the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\n(So far, it seemed to me to be juggling, accompanied by a foolish waste\r\nof ink. I was beginning to feel sleepy again, when Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s next\r\nwords stirred me up.)\r\n\r\nThe Indians looked up the road and down the road once more\xe2\x80\x94and then the\r\nchief Indian said these words to the boy; \xe2\x80\x9cSee the English gentleman\r\nfrom foreign parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it on the road to this house, and on no other,\r\nthat the English gentleman will travel today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is on the road to this house, and on no other, that\r\nthe English gentleman will travel today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian put a second question\xe2\x80\x94after waiting a little first. He said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the English gentleman got It about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy answered\xe2\x80\x94also, after waiting a little first\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian put a third and last question: \xe2\x80\x9cWill the English gentleman\r\ncome here, as he has promised to come, at the close of day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian asked why.\r\n\r\nThe boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am tired. The mist rises in my head, and puzzles me. I\r\ncan see no more today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that the catechism ended. The chief Indian said something in his\r\nown language to the other two, pointing to the boy, and pointing\r\ntowards the town, in which (as we afterwards discovered) they were\r\nlodged. He then, after making more signs on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s head, blew on his\r\nforehead, and so woke him up with a start. After that, they all went on\r\ntheir way towards the town, and the girls saw them no more.\r\n\r\nMost things they say have a moral, if you only look for it. What was\r\nthe moral of this?\r\n\r\nThe moral was, as I thought: First, that the chief juggler had heard\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s arrival talked of among the servants out-of-doors, and\r\nsaw his way to making a little money by it. Second, that he and his men\r\nand boy (with a view to making the said money) meant to hang about till\r\nthey saw my lady drive home, and then to come back, and foretell Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s arrival by magic. Third, that Penelope had heard them\r\nrehearsing their hocus-pocus, like actors rehearsing a play. Fourth,\r\nthat I should do well to have an eye, that evening, on the\r\nplate-basket. Fifth, that Penelope would do well to cool down, and\r\nleave me, her father, to doze off again in the sun.\r\n\r\nThat appeared to me to be the sensible view. If you know anything of\r\nthe ways of young women, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear that Penelope\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it. The moral of the thing was serious, according to my\r\ndaughter. She particularly reminded me of the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s third question,\r\nHas the English gentleman got It about him? \xe2\x80\x9cOh, father!\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nPenelope, clasping her hands, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t joke about this. What does \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Mr. Franklin, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you can wait till Mr.\r\nFranklin comes.\xe2\x80\x9d I winked to show I meant that in joke. Penelope took\r\nit quite seriously. My girl\xe2\x80\x99s earnestness tickled me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth\r\nshould Mr. Franklin know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nPenelope. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd see whether _he_ thinks it a laughing matter, too.\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthat parting shot, my daughter left me.\r\n\r\nI settled it with myself, when she was gone, that I really would ask\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x94mainly to set Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s mind at rest. What was said\r\nbetween us, when I did ask him, later on that same day, you will find\r\nset out fully in its proper place. But as I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to raise your\r\nexpectations and then disappoint them, I will take leave to warn you\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94before we go any further\xe2\x80\x94that you won\xe2\x80\x99t find the ghost of a joke\r\nin our conversation on the subject of the jugglers. To my great\r\nsurprise, Mr. Franklin, like Penelope, took the thing seriously. How\r\nseriously, you will understand, when I tell you that, in his opinion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x9d meant the Moonstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nI am truly sorry to detain you over me and my beehive chair. A sleepy\r\nold man, in a sunny back yard, is not an interesting object, I am well\r\naware. But things must be put down in their places, as things actually\r\nhappened\xe2\x80\x94and you must please to jog on a little while longer with me,\r\nin expectation of Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s arrival later in the day.\r\n\r\nBefore I had time to doze off again, after my daughter Penelope had\r\nleft me, I was disturbed by a rattling of plates and dishes in the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, which meant that dinner was ready. Taking my own meals\r\nin my own sitting-room, I had nothing to do with the servants\xe2\x80\x99 dinner,\r\nexcept to wish them a good stomach to it all round, previous to\r\ncomposing myself once more in my chair. I was just stretching my legs,\r\nwhen out bounced another woman on me. Not my daughter again; only\r\nNancy, the kitchen-maid, this time. I was straight in her way out; and\r\nI observed, as she asked me to let her by, that she had a sulky face\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nthing which, as head of the servants, I never allow, on principle, to\r\npass me without inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you turning your back on your dinner for?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwrong now, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy tried to push by, without answering; upon which I rose up, and\r\ntook her by the ear. She is a nice plump young lass, and it is\r\ncustomary with me to adopt that manner of showing that I personally\r\napprove of a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong now?\xe2\x80\x9d I said once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosanna\xe2\x80\x99s late again for dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nancy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m sent to fetch\r\nher in. All the hard work falls on my shoulders in this house. Let me\r\nalone, Mr. Betteredge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person here mentioned as Rosanna was our second housemaid. Having a\r\nkind of pity for our second housemaid (why, you shall presently know),\r\nand seeing in Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s face, that she would fetch her fellow-servant in\r\nwith more hard words than might be needful under the circumstances, it\r\nstruck me that I had nothing particular to do, and that I might as well\r\nfetch Rosanna myself; giving her a hint to be punctual in future, which\r\nI knew she would take kindly from _me_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Rosanna?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the sands, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d says Nancy, with a toss of her head. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nhad another of her fainting fits this morning, and she asked to go out\r\nand get a breath of fresh air. I have no patience with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to your dinner, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have patience with her,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch her in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNancy (who has a fine appetite) looked pleased. When she looks pleased,\r\nshe looks nice. When she looks nice, I chuck her under the chin. It\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t immorality\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only habit.\r\n\r\nWell, I took my stick, and set off for the sands.\r\n\r\nNo! it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to set off yet. I am sorry again to detain you; but you\r\nreally must hear the story of the sands, and the story of Rosanna\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthis reason, that the matter of the Diamond touches them both nearly.\r\nHow hard I try to get on with my statement without stopping by the way,\r\nand how badly I succeed! But, there!\xe2\x80\x94Persons and Things do turn up so\r\nvexatiously in this life, and will in a manner insist on being noticed.\r\nLet us take it easy, and let us take it short; we shall be in the thick\r\nof the mystery soon, I promise you!\r\n\r\nRosanna (to put the Person before the Thing, which is but common\r\npoliteness) was the only new servant in our house. About four months\r\nbefore the time I am writing of, my lady had been in London, and had\r\ngone over a Reformatory, intended to save forlorn women from drifting\r\nback into bad ways, after they had got released from prison. The\r\nmatron, seeing my lady took an interest in the place, pointed out a\r\ngirl to her, named Rosanna Spearman, and told her a most miserable\r\nstory, which I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to repeat here; for I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be\r\nmade wretched without any use, and no more do you. The upshot of it\r\nwas, that Rosanna Spearman had been a thief, and not being of the sort\r\nthat get up Companies in the City, and rob from thousands, instead of\r\nonly robbing from one, the law laid hold of her, and the prison and the\r\nreformatory followed the lead of the law. The matron\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of\r\nRosanna was (in spite of what she had done) that the girl was one in a\r\nthousand, and that she only wanted a chance to prove herself worthy of\r\nany Christian woman\xe2\x80\x99s interest in her. My lady (being a Christian\r\nwoman, if ever there was one yet) said to the matron, upon that,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosanna Spearman shall have her chance, in my service.\xe2\x80\x9d In a week\r\nafterwards, Rosanna Spearman entered this establishment as our second\r\nhousemaid.\r\n\r\nNot a soul was told the girl\xe2\x80\x99s story, excepting Miss Rachel and me. My\r\nlady, doing me the honour to consult me about most things, consulted me\r\nabout Rosanna. Having fallen a good deal latterly into the late Sir\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s way of always agreeing with my lady, I agreed with her heartily\r\nabout Rosanna Spearman.\r\n\r\nA fairer chance no girl could have had than was given to this poor girl\r\nof ours. None of the servants could cast her past life in her teeth,\r\nfor none of the servants knew what it had been. She had her wages and\r\nher privileges, like the rest of them; and every now and then a\r\nfriendly word from my lady, in private, to encourage her. In return,\r\nshe showed herself, I am bound to say, well worthy of the kind\r\ntreatment bestowed upon her. Though far from strong, and troubled\r\noccasionally with those fainting-fits already mentioned, she went about\r\nher work modestly and uncomplainingly, doing it carefully, and doing it\r\nwell. But, somehow, she failed to make friends among the other women\r\nservants, excepting my daughter Penelope, who was always kind to\r\nRosanna, though never intimate with her.\r\n\r\nI hardly know what the girl did to offend them. There was certainly no\r\nbeauty about her to make the others envious; she was the plainest woman\r\nin the house, with the additional misfortune of having one shoulder\r\nbigger than the other. What the servants chiefly resented, I think, was\r\nher silent tongue and her solitary ways. She read or worked in leisure\r\nhours when the rest gossiped. And when it came to her turn to go out,\r\nnine times out of ten she quietly put on her bonnet, and had her turn\r\nby herself. She never quarrelled, she never took offence; she only kept\r\na certain distance, obstinately and civilly, between the rest of them\r\nand herself. Add to this that, plain as she was, there was just a dash\r\nof something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like a housemaid, and that _was_ like a lady,\r\nabout her. It might have been in her voice, or it might have been in\r\nher face. All I can say is, that the other women pounced on it like\r\nlightning the first day she came into the house, and said (which was\r\nmost unjust) that Rosanna Spearman gave herself airs.\r\n\r\nHaving now told the story of Rosanna, I have only to notice one of the\r\nmany queer ways of this strange girl to get on next to the story of the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nOur house is high up on the Yorkshire coast, and close by the sea. We\r\nhave got beautiful walks all round us, in every direction but one. That\r\none I acknowledge to be a horrid walk. It leads, for a quarter of a\r\nmile, through a melancholy plantation of firs, and brings you out\r\nbetween low cliffs on the loneliest and ugliest little bay on all our\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe sandhills here run down to the sea, and end in two spits of rock\r\njutting out opposite each other, till you lose sight of them in the\r\nwater. One is called the North Spit, and one the South. Between the\r\ntwo, shifting backwards and forwards at certain seasons of the year,\r\nlies the most horrible quicksand on the shores of Yorkshire. At the\r\nturn of the tide, something goes on in the unknown deeps below, which\r\nsets the whole face of the quicksand shivering and trembling in a\r\nmanner most remarkable to see, and which has given to it, among the\r\npeople in our parts, the name of the Shivering Sand. A great bank, half\r\na mile out, nigh the mouth of the bay, breaks the force of the main\r\nocean coming in from the offing. Winter and summer, when the tide flows\r\nover the quicksand, the sea seems to leave the waves behind it on the\r\nbank, and rolls its waters in smoothly with a heave, and covers the\r\nsand in silence. A lonesome and a horrid retreat, I can tell you! No\r\nboat ever ventures into this bay. No children from our fishing-village,\r\ncalled Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, ever come here to play. The very birds of the air,\r\nas it seems to me, give the Shivering Sand a wide berth. That a young\r\nwoman, with dozens of nice walks to choose from, and company to go with\r\nher, if she only said \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d, should prefer this place, and should sit\r\nand work or read in it, all alone, when it\xe2\x80\x99s her turn out, I grant you,\r\npasses belief. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, nevertheless, account for it as you may, that\r\nthis was Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s favourite walk, except when she went once\r\nor twice to Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, to see the only friend she had in our\r\nneighbourhood, of whom more anon. It\xe2\x80\x99s also true that I was now setting\r\nout for this same place, to fetch the girl in to dinner, which brings\r\nus round happily to our former point, and starts us fair again on our\r\nway to the sands.\r\n\r\nI saw no sign of the girl in the plantation. When I got out, through\r\nthe sandhills, on to the beach, there she was, in her little straw\r\nbonnet, and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her\r\ndeformed shoulder as much as might be\xe2\x80\x94there she was, all alone, looking\r\nout on the quicksand and the sea.\r\n\r\nShe started when I came up with her, and turned her head away from me.\r\nNot looking me in the face being another of the proceedings, which, as\r\nhead of the servants, I never allow, on principle, to pass without\r\ninquiry\xe2\x80\x94I turned her round my way, and saw that she was crying. My\r\nbandanna handkerchief\xe2\x80\x94one of six beauties given to me by my lady\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nhandy in my pocket. I took it out, and I said to Rosanna, \xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit\r\ndown, my dear, on the slope of the beach along with me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll dry your\r\neyes for you first, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll make so bold as to ask what you have\r\nbeen crying about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen you come to my age, you will find sitting down on the slope of a\r\nbeach a much longer job than you think it now. By the time I was\r\nsettled, Rosanna had dried her own eyes with a very inferior\r\nhandkerchief to mine\xe2\x80\x94cheap cambric. She looked very quiet, and very\r\nwretched; but she sat down by me like a good girl, when I told her.\r\nWhen you want to comfort a woman by the shortest way, take her on your\r\nknee. I thought of this golden rule. But there! Rosanna wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Nancy,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, tell me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you crying about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the years that are gone, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d says Rosanna quietly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy past life still comes back to me sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyour past life is all sponged out. Why\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t you forget it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took me by one of the lappets of my coat. I am a slovenly old man,\r\nand a good deal of my meat and drink gets splashed about on my clothes.\r\nSometimes one of the women, and sometimes another, cleans me of my\r\ngrease. The day before, Rosanna had taken out a spot for me on the\r\nlappet of my coat, with a new composition, warranted to remove\r\nanything. The grease was gone, but there was a little dull place left\r\non the nap of the cloth where the grease had been. The girl pointed to\r\nthat place, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stain is taken off,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the place shows, Mr.\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x94the place shows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA remark which takes a man unawares by means of his own coat is not an\r\neasy remark to answer. Something in the girl herself, too, made me\r\nparticularly sorry for her just then. She had nice brown eyes, plain as\r\nshe was in other ways\xe2\x80\x94and she looked at me with a sort of respect for\r\nmy happy old age and my good character, as things for ever out of her\r\nown reach, which made my heart heavy for our second housemaid. Not\r\nfeeling myself able to comfort her, there was only one other thing to\r\ndo. That thing was\xe2\x80\x94to take her in to dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me up,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re late for dinner, Rosanna\xe2\x80\x94and I have come\r\nto fetch you in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Mr. Betteredge!\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told Nancy to fetch you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you might like\r\nyour scolding better, my dear, if it came from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of helping me up, the poor thing stole her hand into mine, and\r\ngave it a little squeeze. She tried hard to keep from crying again, and\r\nsucceeded\xe2\x80\x94for which I respected her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very kind, Mr.\r\nBetteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any dinner today\xe2\x80\x94let me bide a\r\nlittle longer here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you like to be here?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that brings you\r\neverlastingly to this miserable place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething draws me to it,\xe2\x80\x9d says the girl, making images with her\r\nfinger in the sand. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to keep away from it, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d says she in a low voice, as if she was frightened at her\r\nown fancy, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes, Mr. Betteredge, I think that my grave is waiting\r\nfor me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s roast mutton and suet pudding waiting for you!\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cGo in\r\nto dinner directly. This is what comes, Rosanna, of thinking on an\r\nempty stomach!\xe2\x80\x9d I spoke severely, being naturally indignant (at my time\r\nof life) to hear a young woman of five-and-twenty talking about her\r\nlatter end!\r\n\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hear me: she put her hand on my shoulder, and kept\r\nme where I was, sitting by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the place has laid a spell on me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI dream of it\r\nnight after night; I think of it when I sit stitching at my work. You\r\nknow I am grateful, Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94you know I try to deserve your\r\nkindness, and my lady\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in me. But I wonder sometimes\r\nwhether the life here is too quiet and too good for such a woman as I\r\nam, after all I have gone through, Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94after all I have gone\r\nthrough. It\xe2\x80\x99s more lonely to me to be among the other servants, knowing\r\nI am not what they are, than it is to be here. My lady doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\r\nthe matron at the reformatory doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, what a dreadful reproach\r\nhonest people are in themselves to a woman like me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t scold me,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a dear good man. I do my work, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Please not to tell my\r\nlady I am discontented\xe2\x80\x94I am not. My mind\xe2\x80\x99s unquiet, sometimes, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d She snatched her hand off my shoulder, and suddenly pointed down\r\nto the quicksand. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it wonderful? isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nterrible? I have seen it dozens of times, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always as new to me\r\nas if I had never seen it before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked where she pointed. The tide was on the turn, and the horrid\r\nsand began to shiver. The broad brown face of it heaved slowly, and\r\nthen dimpled and quivered all over. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what it looks like to\r\n_me?_\xe2\x80\x9d says Rosanna, catching me by the shoulder again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks as if\r\nit had hundreds of suffocating people under it\xe2\x80\x94all struggling to get to\r\nthe surface, and all sinking lower and lower in the dreadful deeps!\r\nThrow a stone in, Mr. Betteredge! Throw a stone in, and let\xe2\x80\x99s see the\r\nsand suck it down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was unwholesome talk! Here was an empty stomach feeding on an\r\nunquiet mind! My answer\xe2\x80\x94a pretty sharp one, in the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ninterests, I promise you!\xe2\x80\x94was at my tongue\xe2\x80\x99s end, when it was snapped\r\nshort off on a sudden by a voice among the sandhills shouting for me by\r\nmy name. \xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nshouted out in return, without a notion in my mind of who it was.\r\nRosanna started to her feet, and stood looking towards the voice. I was\r\njust thinking of getting on my own legs next, when I was staggered by a\r\nsudden change in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nHer complexion turned of a beautiful red, which I had never seen in it\r\nbefore; she brightened all over with a kind of speechless and\r\nbreathless surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. Rosanna gave me back my own\r\nquestion. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said softly, more to herself than to me.\r\nI twisted round on the sand and looked behind me. There, coming out on\r\nus from among the hills, was a bright-eyed young gentleman, dressed in\r\na beautiful fawn-coloured suit, with gloves and hat to match, with a\r\nrose in his button-hole, and a smile on his face that might have set\r\nthe Shivering Sand itself smiling at him in return. Before I could get\r\non my legs, he plumped down on the sand by the side of me, put his arm\r\nround my neck, foreign fashion, and gave me a hug that fairly squeezed\r\nthe breath out of my body. \xe2\x80\x9cDear old Betteredge!\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe you\r\nseven-and-sixpence. Now do you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord bless us and save us! Here\xe2\x80\x94four good hours before we expected\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94was Mr. Franklin Blake!\r\n\r\nBefore I could say a word, I saw Mr. Franklin, a little surprised to\r\nall appearance, look up from me to Rosanna. Following his lead, I\r\nlooked at the girl too. She was blushing of a deeper red than ever,\r\nseemingly at having caught Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s eye; and she turned and left\r\nus suddenly, in a confusion quite unaccountable to my mind, without\r\neither making her curtsey to the gentleman or saying a word to me. Very\r\nunlike her usual self: a civiller and better-behaved servant, in\r\ngeneral, you never met with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an odd girl,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what she sees in me\r\nto surprise her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, drolling on our young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nContinental education, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the varnish from foreign parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI set down here Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s careless question, and my foolish\r\nanswer, as a consolation and encouragement to all stupid people\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nbeing, as I have remarked, a great satisfaction to our inferior\r\nfellow-creatures to find that their betters are, on occasions, no\r\nbrighter than they are. Neither Mr. Franklin, with his wonderful\r\nforeign training, nor I, with my age, experience, and natural\r\nmother-wit, had the ghost of an idea of what Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunaccountable behaviour really meant. She was out of our thoughts, poor\r\nsoul, before we had seen the last flutter of her little grey cloak\r\namong the sandhills. And what of that? you will ask, naturally enough.\r\nRead on, good friend, as patiently as you can, and perhaps you will be\r\nas sorry for Rosanna Spearman as I was, when I found out the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did, after we were left together alone, was to make a\r\nthird attempt to get up from my seat on the sand. Mr. Franklin stopped\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one advantage about this horrid place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have got\r\nit all to ourselves. Stay where you are, Betteredge; I have something\r\nto say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking, I was looking at him, and trying to see\r\nsomething of the boy I remembered, in the man before me. The man put me\r\nout. Look as I might, I could see no more of his boy\xe2\x80\x99s rosy cheeks than\r\nof his boy\xe2\x80\x99s trim little jacket. His complexion had got pale: his face,\r\nat the lower part was covered, to my great surprise and disappointment,\r\nwith a curly brown beard and moustachios. He had a lively touch-and-go\r\nway with him, very pleasant and engaging, I admit; but nothing to\r\ncompare with his free-and-easy manners of other times. To make matters\r\nworse, he had promised to be tall, and had not kept his promise. He was\r\nneat, and slim, and well made; but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t by an inch or two up to\r\nthe middle height. In short, he baffled me altogether. The years that\r\nhad passed had left nothing of his old self, except the bright,\r\nstraightforward look in his eyes. There I found our nice boy again, and\r\nthere I concluded to stop in my investigation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome back to the old place, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the more\r\nwelcome, sir, that you have come some hours before we expected you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a reason for coming before you expected me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr.\r\nFranklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI suspect, Betteredge, that I have been followed and watched\r\nin London, for the last three or four days; and I have travelled by the\r\nmorning instead of the afternoon train, because I wanted to give a\r\ncertain dark-looking stranger the slip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words did more than surprise me. They brought back to my mind, in\r\na flash, the three jugglers, and Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s notion that they meant some\r\nmischief to Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s watching you, sir,\xe2\x80\x94and why?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about the three Indians you have had at the house today,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMr. Franklin, without noticing my question. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just possible,\r\nBetteredge, that my stranger and your three jugglers may turn out to be\r\npieces of the same puzzle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come to know about the jugglers, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, putting one\r\nquestion on the top of another, which was bad manners, I own. But you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t expect much from poor human nature\xe2\x80\x94so don\xe2\x80\x99t expect much from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Penelope at the house,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin; \xe2\x80\x9cand Penelope told\r\nme. Your daughter promised to be a pretty girl, Betteredge, and she has\r\nkept her promise. Penelope has got a small ear and a small foot. Did\r\nthe late Mrs. Betteredge possess those inestimable advantages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe late Mrs. Betteredge possessed a good many defects, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of them (if you will pardon my mentioning it) was never keeping to\r\nthe matter in hand. She was more like a fly than a woman: she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsettle on anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would just have suited me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI never settle on\r\nanything either. Betteredge, your edge is better than ever. Your\r\ndaughter said as much, when I asked for particulars about the jugglers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father will tell you, sir. He\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful man for his age; and he\r\nexpresses himself beautifully.\xe2\x80\x99 Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s own words\xe2\x80\x94blushing divinely.\r\nNot even my respect for you prevented me from\xe2\x80\x94never mind; I knew her\r\nwhen she was a child, and she\xe2\x80\x99s none the worse for it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be\r\nserious. What did the jugglers do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was something dissatisfied with my daughter\xe2\x80\x94not for letting Mr.\r\nFranklin kiss her; Mr. Franklin was welcome to _that_\xe2\x80\x94but for forcing\r\nme to tell her foolish story at second hand. However, there was no help\r\nfor it now but to mention the circumstances. Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s merriment\r\nall died away as I went on. He sat knitting his eyebrows, and twisting\r\nhis beard. When I had done, he repeated after me two of the questions\r\nwhich the chief juggler had put to the boy\xe2\x80\x94seemingly for the purpose of\r\nfixing them well in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is it on the road to this house, and on no other, that the English\r\ngentleman will travel today?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Has the English gentleman got It about\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99 I suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, pulling a little sealed paper\r\nparcel out of his pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99 means _this_. And \xe2\x80\x98this,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBetteredge, means my uncle Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s famous Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke out, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you come to be in charge of the\r\nwicked Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wicked Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s will has left his Diamond as a birthday present\r\nto my cousin Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my father, as the wicked\r\nColonel\xe2\x80\x99s executor, has given it in charge to me to bring down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the sea, then oozing in smoothly over the Shivering Sand, had been\r\nchanged into dry land before my own eyes, I doubt if I could have been\r\nmore surprised than I was when Mr. Franklin spoke those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Diamond left to Miss Rachel!\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your father,\r\nsir, the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s executor! Why, I would have laid any bet you like,\r\nMr. Franklin, that your father wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have touched the Colonel with a\r\npair of tongs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrong language, Betteredge! What was there against the Colonel. He\r\nbelonged to your time, not to mine. Tell me what you know about him,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how my father came to be his executor, and more\r\nbesides. I have made some discoveries in London about my uncle\r\nHerncastle and his Diamond, which have rather an ugly look to my eyes;\r\nand I want you to confirm them. You called him the \xe2\x80\x98wicked Colonel\xe2\x80\x99\r\njust now. Search your memory, my old friend, and tell me why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw he was in earnest, and I told him.\r\n\r\nHere follows the substance of what I said, written out entirely for\r\nyour benefit. Pay attention to it, or you will be all abroad, when we\r\nget deeper into the story. Clear your mind of the children, or the\r\ndinner, or the new bonnet, or what not. Try if you can\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\npolitics, horses, prices in the City, and grievances at the club. I\r\nhope you won\xe2\x80\x99t take this freedom on my part amiss; it\xe2\x80\x99s only a way I\r\nhave of appealing to the gentle reader. Lord! haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen you with\r\nthe greatest authors in your hands, and don\xe2\x80\x99t I know how ready your\r\nattention is to wander when it\xe2\x80\x99s a book that asks for it, instead of a\r\nperson?\r\n\r\nI spoke, a little way back, of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s father, the old lord with the\r\nshort temper and the long tongue. He had five children in all. Two sons\r\nto begin with; then, after a long time, his wife broke out breeding\r\nagain, and the three young ladies came briskly one after the other, as\r\nfast as the nature of things would permit; my mistress, as before\r\nmentioned, being the youngest and best of the three. Of the two sons,\r\nthe eldest, Arthur, inherited the title and estates. The second, the\r\nHonourable John, got a fine fortune left him by a relative, and went\r\ninto the army.\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an ill bird, they say, that fouls its own nest. I look on the\r\nnoble family of the Herncastles as being my nest; and I shall take it\r\nas a favour if I am not expected to enter into particulars on the\r\nsubject of the Honourable John. He was, I honestly believe, one of the\r\ngreatest blackguards that ever lived. I can hardly say more or less for\r\nhim than that. He went into the army, beginning in the Guards. He had\r\nto leave the Guards before he was two-and-twenty\xe2\x80\x94never mind why. They\r\nare very strict in the army, and they were too strict for the\r\nHonourable John. He went out to India to see whether they were equally\r\nstrict there, and to try a little active service. In the matter of\r\nbravery (to give him his due), he was a mixture of bull-dog and\r\ngame-cock, with a dash of the savage. He was at the taking of\r\nSeringapatam. Soon afterwards he changed into another regiment, and, in\r\ncourse of time, changed into a third. In the third he got his last step\r\nas lieutenant-colonel, and, getting that, got also a sunstroke, and\r\ncame home to England.\r\n\r\nHe came back with a character that closed the doors of all his family\r\nagainst him, my lady (then just married) taking the lead, and declaring\r\n(with Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s approval, of course) that her brother should never\r\nenter any house of hers. There was more than one slur on the Colonel\r\nthat made people shy of him; but the blot of the Diamond is all I need\r\nmention here.\r\n\r\nIt was said he had got possession of his Indian jewel by means which,\r\nbold as he was, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare acknowledge. He never attempted to sell\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94not being in need of money, and not (to give him his due again)\r\nmaking money an object. He never gave it away; he never even showed it\r\nto any living soul. Some said he was afraid of its getting him into a\r\ndifficulty with the military authorities; others (very ignorant indeed\r\nof the real nature of the man) said he was afraid, if he showed it, of\r\nits costing him his life.\r\n\r\nThere was perhaps a grain of truth mixed up with this last report. It\r\nwas false to say that he was afraid; but it was a fact that his life\r\nhad been twice threatened in India; and it was firmly believed that the\r\nMoonstone was at the bottom of it. When he came back to England, and\r\nfound himself avoided by everybody, the Moonstone was thought to be at\r\nthe bottom of it again. The mystery of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s life got in the\r\nColonel\xe2\x80\x99s way, and outlawed him, as you may say, among his own people.\r\nThe men wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him into their clubs; the women\xe2\x80\x94more than one\xe2\x80\x94whom\r\nhe wanted to marry, refused him; friends and relations got too\r\nnear-sighted to see him in the street.\r\n\r\nSome men in this mess would have tried to set themselves right with the\r\nworld. But to give in, even when he was wrong, and had all society\r\nagainst him, was not the way of the Honourable John. He had kept the\r\nDiamond, in flat defiance of assassination, in India. He kept the\r\nDiamond, in flat defiance of public opinion, in England. There you have\r\nthe portrait of the man before you, as in a picture: a character that\r\nbraved everything; and a face, handsome as it was, that looked\r\npossessed by the devil.\r\n\r\nWe heard different rumours about him from time to time. Sometimes they\r\nsaid he was given up to smoking opium and collecting old books;\r\nsometimes he was reported to be trying strange things in chemistry;\r\nsometimes he was seen carousing and amusing himself among the lowest\r\npeople in the lowest slums of London. Anyhow, a solitary, vicious,\r\nunderground life was the life the Colonel led. Once, and once only,\r\nafter his return to England, I myself saw him, face to face.\r\n\r\nAbout two years before the time of which I am now writing, and about a\r\nyear and a half before the time of his death, the Colonel came\r\nunexpectedly to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s house in London. It was the night of Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, the twenty-first of June; and there was a party in\r\nhonour of it, as usual. I received a message from the footman to say\r\nthat a gentleman wanted to see me. Going up into the hall, there I\r\nfound the Colonel, wasted, and worn, and old, and shabby, and as wild\r\nand as wicked as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo up to my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cand say that I have called to wish my\r\nniece many happy returns of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had made attempts by letter, more than once already, to be\r\nreconciled with my lady, for no other purpose, I am firmly persuaded,\r\nthan to annoy her. But this was the first time he had actually come to\r\nthe house. I had it on the tip of my tongue to say that my mistress had\r\na party that night. But the devilish look of him daunted me. I went\r\nupstairs with his message, and left him, by his own desire, waiting in\r\nthe hall. The servants stood staring at him, at a distance, as if he\r\nwas a walking engine of destruction, loaded with powder and shot, and\r\nlikely to go off among them at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\nMy lady had a dash\xe2\x80\x94no more\xe2\x80\x94of the family temper. \xe2\x80\x9cTell Colonel\r\nHerncastle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when I gave her her brother\xe2\x80\x99s message, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nMiss Verinder is engaged, and that _I_ decline to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d I tried to\r\nplead for a civiller answer than that; knowing the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstitutional superiority to the restraints which govern gentlemen in\r\ngeneral. Quite useless! The family temper flashed out at me directly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I want your advice,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that I always ask\r\nfor it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for it now.\xe2\x80\x9d I went downstairs with the message, of\r\nwhich I took the liberty of presenting a new and amended edition of my\r\nown contriving, as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady and Miss Rachel regret that they\r\nare engaged, Colonel; and beg to be excused having the honour of seeing\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expected him to break out, even at that polite way of putting it. To\r\nmy surprise he did nothing of the sort; he alarmed me by taking the\r\nthing with an unnatural quiet. His eyes, of a glittering bright grey,\r\njust settled on me for a moment; and he laughed, not _out_ of himself,\r\nlike other people, but _into_ himself, in a soft, chuckling, horridly\r\nmischievous way. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall remember my\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, he turned on his heel, and walked out of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe next birthday came round, and we heard he was ill in bed. Six\r\nmonths afterwards\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, six months before the time I am now\r\nwriting of\xe2\x80\x94there came a letter from a highly respectable clergyman to\r\nmy lady. It communicated two wonderful things in the way of family\r\nnews. First, that the Colonel had forgiven his sister on his death-bed.\r\nSecond, that he had forgiven everybody else, and had made a most\r\nedifying end. I have myself (in spite of the bishops and the clergy) an\r\nunfeigned respect for the Church; but I am firmly persuaded, at the\r\nsame time, that the devil remained in undisturbed possession of the\r\nHonourable John, and that the last abominable act in the life of that\r\nabominable man was (saving your presence) to take the clergyman in!\r\n\r\nThis was the sum-total of what I had to tell Mr. Franklin. I remarked\r\nthat he listened more and more eagerly the longer I went on. Also, that\r\nthe story of the Colonel being sent away from his sister\xe2\x80\x99s door, on the\r\noccasion of his niece\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, seemed to strike Mr. Franklin like a\r\nshot that had hit the mark. Though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge it, I saw that\r\nI had made him uneasy, plainly enough, in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said your say, Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my turn now.\r\nBefore, however, I tell you what discoveries I have made in London, and\r\nhow I came to be mixed up in this matter of the Diamond, I want to know\r\none thing. You look, my old friend, as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand\r\nthe object to be answered by this consultation of ours. Do your looks\r\nbelie you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy looks, on this occasion at any rate, tell the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose I put you up to my point of\r\nview, before we go any further. I see three very serious questions\r\ninvolved in the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday-gift to my cousin Rachel. Follow me\r\ncarefully, Betteredge; and count me off on your fingers, if it will\r\nhelp you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, with a certain pleasure in showing how\r\nclear-headed he could be, which reminded me wonderfully of old times\r\nwhen he was a boy. \xe2\x80\x9cQuestion the first: Was the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Diamond the\r\nobject of a conspiracy in India? Question the second: Has the\r\nconspiracy followed the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Diamond to England? Question the\r\nthird: Did the Colonel know the conspiracy followed the Diamond; and\r\nhas he purposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister,\r\nthrough the innocent medium of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s child? _That_ is what I am\r\ndriving at, Betteredge. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me frighten you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say that, but he _had_ frightened me.\r\n\r\nIf he was right, here was our quiet English house suddenly invaded by a\r\ndevilish Indian Diamond\xe2\x80\x94bringing after it a conspiracy of living\r\nrogues, set loose on us by the vengeance of a dead man. There was our\r\nsituation as revealed to me in Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s last words! Who ever\r\nheard the like of it\xe2\x80\x94in the nineteenth century, mind; in an age of\r\nprogress, and in a country which rejoices in the blessings of the\r\nBritish constitution? Nobody ever heard the like of it, and,\r\nconsequently, nobody can be expected to believe it. I shall go on with\r\nmy story, however, in spite of that.\r\n\r\nWhen you get a sudden alarm, of the sort that I had got now, nine times\r\nout of ten the place you feel it in is your stomach. When you feel it\r\nin your stomach, your attention wanders, and you begin to fidget. I\r\nfidgeted silently in my place on the sand. Mr. Franklin noticed me,\r\ncontending with a perturbed stomach or mind\xe2\x80\x94which you please; they mean\r\nthe same thing\xe2\x80\x94and, checking himself just as he was starting with his\r\npart of the story, said to me sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat did I want? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell _him_; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell _you_, in\r\nconfidence. I wanted a whiff of my pipe, and a turn at _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nKeeping my private sentiments to myself, I respectfully requested Mr.\r\nFranklin to go on. Mr. Franklin replied, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fidget, Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand went on.\r\n\r\nOur young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s first words informed me that his discoveries,\r\nconcerning the wicked Colonel and the Diamond, had begun with a visit\r\nwhich he had paid (before he came to us) to the family lawyer, at\r\nHampstead. A chance word dropped by Mr. Franklin, when the two were\r\nalone, one day, after dinner, revealed that he had been charged by his\r\nfather with a birthday present to be taken to Miss Rachel. One thing\r\nled to another; and it ended in the lawyer mentioning what the present\r\nreally was, and how the friendly connexion between the late Colonel and\r\nMr. Blake, senior, had taken its rise. The facts here are really so\r\nextraordinary, that I doubt if I can trust my own language to do\r\njustice to them. I prefer trying to report Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries,\r\nas nearly as may be, in Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s own words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember the time, Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen my father was\r\ntrying to prove his title to that unlucky Dukedom? Well! that was also\r\nthe time when my uncle Herncastle returned from India. My father\r\ndiscovered that his brother-in-law was in possession of certain papers\r\nwhich were likely to be of service to him in his lawsuit. He called on\r\nthe Colonel, on pretence of welcoming him back to England. The Colonel\r\nwas not to be deluded in that way. \xe2\x80\x98You want something,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98or\r\nyou would never have compromised your reputation by calling on _me_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMy father saw that the one chance for him was to show his hand; he\r\nadmitted, at once, that he wanted the papers. The Colonel asked for a\r\nday to consider his answer. His answer came in the shape of a most\r\nextraordinary letter, which my friend the lawyer showed me. The Colonel\r\nbegan by saying that he wanted something of my father, and that he\r\nbegged to propose an exchange of friendly services between them. The\r\nfortune of war (that was the expression he used) had placed him in\r\npossession of one of the largest Diamonds in the world; and he had\r\nreason to believe that neither he nor his precious jewel was safe in\r\nany house, in any quarter of the globe, which they occupied together.\r\nUnder these alarming circumstances, he had determined to place his\r\nDiamond in the keeping of another person. That person was not expected\r\nto run any risk. He might deposit the precious stone in any place\r\nespecially guarded and set apart\xe2\x80\x94like a banker\xe2\x80\x99s or jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrongroom\xe2\x80\x94for the safe custody of valuables of high price. His main\r\npersonal responsibility in the matter was to be of the passive kind. He\r\nwas to undertake either by himself, or by a trustworthy\r\nrepresentative\xe2\x80\x94to receive at a prearranged address, on certain\r\nprearranged days in every year, a note from the Colonel, simply stating\r\nthe fact that he was a living man at that date. In the event of the\r\ndate passing over without the note being received, the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsilence might be taken as a sure token of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s death by\r\nmurder. In that case, and in no other, certain sealed instructions\r\nrelating to the disposal of the Diamond, and deposited with it, were to\r\nbe opened, and followed implicitly. If my father chose to accept this\r\nstrange charge, the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s papers were at his disposal in return.\r\nThat was the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did your father do, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what he did. He brought the\r\ninvaluable faculty, called common sense, to bear on the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. The whole thing, he declared, was simply absurd. Somewhere in\r\nhis Indian wanderings, the Colonel had picked up with some wretched\r\ncrystal which he took for a diamond. As for the danger of his being\r\nmurdered, and the precautions devised to preserve his life and his\r\npiece of crystal, this was the nineteenth century, and any man in his\r\nsenses had only to apply to the police. The Colonel had been a\r\nnotorious opium-eater for years past; and, if the only way of getting\r\nat the valuable papers he possessed was by accepting a matter of opium\r\nas a matter of fact, my father was quite willing to take the ridiculous\r\nresponsibility imposed on him\xe2\x80\x94all the more readily that it involved no\r\ntrouble to himself. The Diamond and the sealed instructions went into\r\nhis banker\xe2\x80\x99s strongroom, and the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s letters, periodically\r\nreporting him a living man, were received and opened by our family\r\nlawyer, Mr. Bruff, as my father\xe2\x80\x99s representative. No sensible person,\r\nin a similar position, could have viewed the matter in any other way.\r\nNothing in this world, Betteredge, is probable unless it appeals to our\r\nown trumpery experience; and we only believe in a romance when we see\r\nit in a newspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain to me from this, that Mr. Franklin thought his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotion about the Colonel hasty and wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your own private opinion about the matter, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s finish the story of the Colonel first,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a curious want of system, Betteredge, in the English mind;\r\nand your question, my old friend, is an instance of it. When we are not\r\noccupied in making machinery, we are (mentally speaking) the most\r\nslovenly people in the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a foreign education! He has\r\nlearned that way of girding at us in France, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin took up the lost thread, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgot the papers he wanted, and never saw his\r\nbrother-in-law again from that time. Year after year, on the\r\nprearranged days, the prearranged letter came from the Colonel, and was\r\nopened by Mr. Bruff. I have seen the letters, in a heap, all of them\r\nwritten in the same brief, business-like form of words: \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x94This is\r\nto certify that I am still a living man. Let the Diamond be. John\r\nHerncastle.\xe2\x80\x99 That was all he ever wrote, and that came regularly to the\r\nday; until some six or eight months since, when the form of the letter\r\nvaried for the first time. It ran now: \xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x94They tell me I am dying.\r\nCome to me, and help me to make my will.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Bruff went, and found\r\nhim, in the little suburban villa, surrounded by its own grounds, in\r\nwhich he had lived alone, ever since he had left India. He had dogs,\r\ncats, and birds to keep him company; but no human being near him,\r\nexcept the person who came daily to do the house-work, and the doctor\r\nat the bedside. The will was a very simple matter. The Colonel had\r\ndissipated the greater part of his fortune in his chemical\r\ninvestigations. His will began and ended in three clauses, which he\r\ndictated from his bed, in perfect possession of his faculties. The\r\nfirst clause provided for the safe keeping and support of his animals.\r\nThe second founded a professorship of experimental chemistry at a\r\nnorthern university. The third bequeathed the Moonstone as a birthday\r\npresent to his niece, on condition that my father would act as\r\nexecutor. My father at first refused to act. On second thoughts,\r\nhowever, he gave way, partly because he was assured that the\r\nexecutorship would involve him in no trouble; partly because Mr. Bruff\r\nsuggested, in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s interest, that the Diamond might be worth\r\nsomething, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the Colonel give any reason, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy he left the\r\nDiamond to Miss Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe not only gave the reason\xe2\x80\x94he had the reason written in his will,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got an extract, which you shall see\r\npresently. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be slovenly-minded, Betteredge! One thing at a time.\r\nYou have heard about the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Will; now you must hear what\r\nhappened after the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s death. It was formally necessary to have\r\nthe Diamond valued, before the Will could be proved. All the jewellers\r\nconsulted, at once confirmed the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that he possessed\r\none of the largest diamonds in the world. The question of accurately\r\nvaluing it presented some serious difficulties. Its size made it a\r\nphenomenon in the diamond market; its colour placed it in a category by\r\nitself; and, to add to these elements of uncertainty, there was a\r\ndefect, in the shape of a flaw, in the very heart of the stone. Even\r\nwith this last serious draw-back, however, the lowest of the various\r\nestimates given was twenty thousand pounds. Conceive my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishment! He had been within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth of refusing to act as\r\nexecutor, and of allowing this magnificent jewel to be lost to the\r\nfamily. The interest he took in the matter now, induced him to open the\r\nsealed instructions which had been deposited with the Diamond. Mr.\r\nBruff showed this document to me, with the other papers; and it\r\nsuggests (to my mind) a clue to the nature of the conspiracy which\r\nthreatened the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do believe, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was a conspiracy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot possessing my father\xe2\x80\x99s excellent common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr.\r\nFranklin, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s life was threatened, exactly as the\r\nColonel said. The sealed instructions, as I think, explain how it was\r\nthat he died, after all, quietly in his bed. In the event of his death\r\nby violence (that is to say, in the absence of the regular letter from\r\nhim at the appointed date), my father was then directed to send the\r\nMoonstone secretly to Amsterdam. It was to be deposited in that city\r\nwith a famous diamond-cutter, and it was to be cut up into from four to\r\nsix separate stones. The stones were then to be sold for what they\r\nwould fetch, and the proceeds were to be applied to the founding of\r\nthat professorship of experimental chemistry, which the Colonel has\r\nsince endowed by his Will. Now, Betteredge, exert those sharp wits of\r\nyours, and observe the conclusion to which the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s instructions\r\npoint!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI instantly exerted my wits. They were of the slovenly English sort;\r\nand they consequently muddled it all, until Mr. Franklin took them in\r\nhand, and pointed out what they ought to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemark,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the integrity of the Diamond, as a\r\nwhole stone, is here artfully made dependent on the preservation from\r\nviolence of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s life. He is not satisfied with saying to the\r\nenemies he dreads, \xe2\x80\x98Kill me\xe2\x80\x94and you will be no nearer to the Diamond\r\nthan you are now; it is where you can\xe2\x80\x99t get at it\xe2\x80\x94in the guarded\r\nstrongroom of a bank.\xe2\x80\x99 He says instead, \xe2\x80\x98Kill me\xe2\x80\x94and the Diamond will\r\nbe the Diamond no longer; its identity will be destroyed.\xe2\x80\x99 What does\r\nthat mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I had (as I thought) a flash of the wonderful foreign brightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means lowering the value of the stone, and\r\ncheating the rogues in that way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI have inquired about that.\r\nThe flawed Diamond, cut up, would actually fetch more than the Diamond\r\nas it now is; for this plain reason\xe2\x80\x94that from four to six perfect\r\nbrilliants might be cut from it, which would be, collectively, worth\r\nmore money than the large\xe2\x80\x94but imperfect single stone. If robbery for\r\nthe purpose of gain was at the bottom of the conspiracy, the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstructions absolutely made the Diamond better worth stealing. More\r\nmoney could have been got for it, and the disposal of it in the diamond\r\nmarket would have been infinitely easier, if it had passed through the\r\nhands of the workmen of Amsterdam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless us, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the plot, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA plot organised among the Indians who originally owned the jewel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca plot with some old Hindoo superstition at the\r\nbottom of it. That is my opinion, confirmed by a family paper which I\r\nhave about me at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw, now, why the appearance of the three Indian jugglers at our\r\nhouse had presented itself to Mr. Franklin in the light of a\r\ncircumstance worth noting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to force my opinion on you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nidea of certain chosen servants of an old Hindoo superstition devoting\r\nthemselves, through all difficulties and dangers, to watching the\r\nopportunity of recovering their sacred gem, appears to _me_ to be\r\nperfectly consistent with everything that we know of the patience of\r\nOriental races, and the influence of Oriental religions. But then I am\r\nan imaginative man; and the butcher, the baker, and the tax-gatherer,\r\nare not the only credible realities in existence to _my_ mind. Let the\r\nguess I have made at the truth in this matter go for what it is worth,\r\nand let us get on to the only practical question that concerns us. Does\r\nthe conspiracy against the Moonstone survive the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s death? And\r\ndid the Colonel know it, when he left the birthday gift to his niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to see my lady and Miss Rachel at the end of it all, now. Not a\r\nword he said escaped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not very willing, when I discovered the story of the Moonstone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cto be the means of bringing it here. But Mr. Bruff\r\nreminded me that somebody must put my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s legacy into my cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands\xe2\x80\x94and that I might as well do it as anybody else. After taking the\r\nDiamond out of the bank, I fancied I was followed in the streets by a\r\nshabby, dark-complexioned man. I went to my father\xe2\x80\x99s house to pick up\r\nmy luggage, and found a letter there, which unexpectedly detained me in\r\nLondon. I went back to the bank with the Diamond, and thought I saw the\r\nshabby man again. Taking the Diamond once more out of the bank this\r\nmorning, I saw the man for the third time, gave him the slip, and\r\nstarted (before he recovered the trace of me) by the morning instead of\r\nthe afternoon train. Here I am, with the Diamond safe and sound\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhat is the first news that meets me? I find that three strolling\r\nIndians have been at the house, and that my arrival from London, and\r\nsomething which I am expected to have about me, are two special objects\r\nof investigation to them when they believe themselves to be alone. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t waste time and words on their pouring the ink into the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, and telling him to look in it for a man at a distance, and for\r\nsomething in that man\xe2\x80\x99s pocket. The thing (which I have often seen done\r\nin the East) is \xe2\x80\x98hocus-pocus\xe2\x80\x99 in my opinion, as it is in yours. The\r\npresent question for us to decide is, whether I am wrongly attaching a\r\nmeaning to a mere accident? or whether we really have evidence of the\r\nIndians being on the track of the Moonstone, the moment it is removed\r\nfrom the safe keeping of the bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither he nor I seemed to fancy dealing with this part of the inquiry.\r\nWe looked at each other, and then we looked at the tide, oozing in\r\nsmoothly, higher and higher, over the Shivering Sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should like to shy the\r\nDiamond into the quicksand, and settle the question in _that_ way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have got the value of the stone in your pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr.\r\nFranklin, \xe2\x80\x9csay so, Betteredge, and in it goes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s curious to note, when your mind\xe2\x80\x99s anxious, how very far in the way\r\nof relief a very small joke will go. We found a fund of merriment, at\r\nthe time, in the notion of making away with Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s lawful\r\nproperty, and getting Mr. Blake, as executor, into dreadful\r\ntrouble\xe2\x80\x94though where the merriment was, I am quite at a loss to\r\ndiscover now.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin was the first to bring the talk back to the talk\xe2\x80\x99s proper\r\npurpose. He took an envelope out of his pocket, opened it, and handed\r\nto me the paper inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must face the question of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmotive in leaving this legacy to his niece, for my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Bear in\r\nmind how Lady Verinder treated her brother from the time when he\r\nreturned to England, to the time when he told you he should remember\r\nhis niece\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. And read that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave me the extract from the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Will. I have got it by me\r\nwhile I write these words; and I copy it, as follows, for your benefit:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirdly, and lastly, I give and bequeath to my niece, Rachel Verinder,\r\ndaughter and only child of my sister, Julia Verinder, widow\xe2\x80\x94if her\r\nmother, the said Julia Verinder, shall be living on the said Rachel\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s next Birthday after my death\xe2\x80\x94the yellow Diamond belonging to\r\nme, and known in the East by the name of The Moonstone: subject to this\r\ncondition, that her mother, the said Julia Verinder, shall be living at\r\nthe time. And I hereby desire my executor to give my Diamond, either by\r\nhis own hands or by the hands of some trustworthy representative whom\r\nhe shall appoint, into the personal possession of my said niece Rachel,\r\non her next birthday after my death, and in the presence, if possible,\r\nof my sister, the said Julia Verinder. And I desire that my said sister\r\nmay be informed, by means of a true copy of this, the third and last\r\nclause of my Will, that I give the Diamond to her daughter Rachel, in\r\ntoken of my free forgiveness of the injury which her conduct towards me\r\nhas been the means of inflicting on my reputation in my lifetime; and\r\nespecially in proof that I pardon, as becomes a dying man, the insult\r\noffered to me as an officer and a gentleman, when her servant, by her\r\norders, closed the door of her house against me, on the occasion of her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore words followed these, providing if my lady was dead, or if Miss\r\nRachel was dead, at the time of the testator\xe2\x80\x99s decease, for the Diamond\r\nbeing sent to Holland, in accordance with the sealed instructions\r\noriginally deposited with it. The proceeds of the sale were, in that\r\ncase, to be added to the money already left by the Will for the\r\nprofessorship of chemistry at the university in the north.\r\n\r\nI handed the paper back to Mr. Franklin, sorely troubled what to say to\r\nhim. Up to that moment, my own opinion had been (as you know) that the\r\nColonel had died as wickedly as he had lived. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say the copy from\r\nhis Will actually converted me from that opinion: I only say it\r\nstaggered me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cnow you have read the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nstatement, what do you say? In bringing the Moonstone to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, am I serving his vengeance blindfold, or am I vindicating him in\r\nthe character of a penitent and Christian man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems hard to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he died with a horrid\r\nrevenge in his heart, and a horrid lie on his lips. God alone knows the\r\ntruth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin sat twisting and turning the extract from the Will in his\r\nfingers, as if he expected to squeeze the truth out of it in that\r\nmanner. He altered quite remarkably, at the same time. From being brisk\r\nand bright, he now became, most unaccountably, a slow, solemn, and\r\npondering young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis question has two sides,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Objective side, and a\r\nSubjective side. Which are we to take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had had a German education as well as a French. One of the two had\r\nbeen in undisturbed possession of him (as I supposed) up to this time.\r\nAnd now (as well as I could make out) the other was taking its place.\r\nIt is one of my rules in life, never to notice what I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\r\nI steered a middle course between the Objective side and the Subjective\r\nside. In plain English I stared hard, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s extract the inner meaning of this,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did\r\nmy uncle leave the Diamond to Rachel? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he leave it to my\r\naunt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not beyond guessing, sir, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cColonel\r\nHerncastle knew my lady well enough to know that she would have refused\r\nto accept any legacy that came to her from _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he know that Rachel might not refuse to accept it, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any young lady in existence, sir, who could resist the\r\ntemptation of accepting such a birthday present as The Moonstone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the Subjective view,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt does you great\r\ncredit, Betteredge, to be able to take the Subjective view. But there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother mystery about the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s legacy which is not accounted for\r\nyet. How are we to explain his only giving Rachel her birthday present\r\nconditionally on her mother being alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to slander a dead man, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if he _has_\r\npurposely left a legacy of trouble and danger to his sister, by the\r\nmeans of her child, it must be a legacy made conditional on his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s being alive to feel the vexation of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! That\xe2\x80\x99s your interpretation of his motive, is it? The Subjective\r\ninterpretation again! Have you ever been in Germany, Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. What\xe2\x80\x99s your interpretation, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s object may, quite\r\npossibly, have been\xe2\x80\x94not to benefit his niece, whom he had never even\r\nseen\xe2\x80\x94but to prove to his sister that he had died forgiving her, and to\r\nprove it very prettily by means of a present made to her child. There\r\nis a totally different explanation from yours, Betteredge, taking its\r\nrise in a Subjective-Objective point of view. From all I can see, one\r\ninterpretation is just as likely to be right as the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving brought matters to this pleasant and comforting issue, Mr.\r\nFranklin appeared to think that he had completed all that was required\r\nof him. He laid down flat on his back on the sand, and asked what was\r\nto be done next.\r\n\r\nHe had been so clever, and clear-headed (before he began to talk the\r\nforeign gibberish), and had so completely taken the lead in the\r\nbusiness up to the present time, that I was quite unprepared for such a\r\nsudden change as he now exhibited in this helpless leaning upon _me_.\r\nIt was not till later that I learned\xe2\x80\x94by assistance of Miss Rachel, who\r\nwas the first to make the discovery\xe2\x80\x94that these puzzling shifts and\r\ntransformations in Mr. Franklin were due to the effect on him of his\r\nforeign training. At the age when we are all of us most apt to take our\r\ncolouring, in the form of a reflection from the colouring of other\r\npeople, he had been sent abroad, and had been passed on from one nation\r\nto another, before there was time for anyone colouring more than\r\nanother to settle itself on him firmly. As a consequence of this, he\r\nhad come back with so many different sides to his character, all more\r\nor less jarring with each other, that he seemed to pass his life in a\r\nstate of perpetual contradiction with himself. He could be a busy man,\r\nand a lazy man; cloudy in the head, and clear in the head; a model of\r\ndetermination, and a spectacle of helplessness, all together. He had\r\nhis French side, and his German side, and his Italian side\xe2\x80\x94the original\r\nEnglish foundation showing through, every now and then, as much as to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am, sorely transmogrified, as you see, but there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething of me left at the bottom of him still.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Rachel used to\r\nremark that the Italian side of him was uppermost, on those occasions\r\nwhen he unexpectedly gave in, and asked you in his nice sweet-tempered\r\nway to take his own responsibilities on your shoulders. You will do him\r\nno injustice, I think, if you conclude that the Italian side of him was\r\nuppermost now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it your business, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto know what to do next?\r\nSurely it can\xe2\x80\x99t be mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to see the force of my question\xe2\x80\x94not being in\r\na position, at the time, to see anything but the sky over his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to alarm my aunt without reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to leave her without what may be a needful warning. If you were in\r\nmy place, Betteredge, tell me, in one word, what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn one word, I told him: \xe2\x80\x9cWait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI proceeded to explain myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I understand it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9csomebody is bound to put this\r\nplaguy Diamond into Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hands on her birthday\xe2\x80\x94and you may as\r\nwell do it as another. Very good. This is the twenty-fifth of May, and\r\nthe birthday is on the twenty-first of June. We have got close on four\r\nweeks before us. Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait and see what happens in that time; and\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s warn my lady, or not, as the circumstances direct us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfect, Betteredge, as far as it goes!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nbetween this and the birthday, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done with the Diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat your father did with it, to be sure, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nfather put it in the safe keeping of a bank in London. You put in the\r\nsafe keeping of the bank at Frizinghall.\xe2\x80\x9d (Frizinghall was our nearest\r\ntown, and the Bank of England wasn\xe2\x80\x99t safer than the bank there.) \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nwere you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cI would ride straight away with it to\r\nFrizinghall before the ladies come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prospect of doing something\xe2\x80\x94and, what is more, of doing that\r\nsomething on a horse\xe2\x80\x94brought Mr. Franklin up like lightning from the\r\nflat of his back. He sprang to his feet, and pulled me up, without\r\nceremony, on to mine. \xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge, you are worth your weight in gold,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, and saddle the best horse in the stables\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere (God bless it!) was the original English foundation of him showing\r\nthrough all the foreign varnish at last! Here was the Master Franklin I\r\nremembered, coming out again in the good old way at the prospect of a\r\nride, and reminding me of the good old times! Saddle a horse for him? I\r\nwould have saddled a dozen horses, if he could only have ridden them\r\nall!\r\n\r\nWe went back to the house in a hurry; we had the fleetest horse in the\r\nstables saddled in a hurry; and Mr. Franklin rattled off in a hurry, to\r\nlodge the cursed Diamond once more in the strongroom of a bank. When I\r\nheard the last of his horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs on the drive, and when I turned\r\nabout in the yard and found I was alone again, I felt half inclined to\r\nask myself if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t woke up from a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWhile I was in this bewildered frame of mind, sorely needing a little\r\nquiet time by myself to put me right again, my daughter Penelope got in\r\nmy way (just as her late mother used to get in my way on the stairs),\r\nand instantly summoned me to tell her all that had passed at the\r\nconference between Mr. Franklin and me. Under present circumstances,\r\nthe one thing to be done was to clap the extinguisher upon Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncuriosity on the spot. I accordingly replied that Mr. Franklin and I\r\nhad both talked of foreign politics, till we could talk no longer, and\r\nhad then mutually fallen asleep in the heat of the sun. Try that sort\r\nof answer when your wife or your daughter next worries you with an\r\nawkward question at an awkward time, and depend on the natural\r\nsweetness of women for kissing and making it up again at the next\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore on, and my lady and Miss Rachel came back.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say how astonished they were, when they heard that Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake had arrived, and had gone off again on horseback.\r\nNeedless also to say, that _they_ asked awkward questions directly, and\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9cforeign politics\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cfalling asleep in the sun\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve a second time over with _them_. Being at the end of my\r\ninvention, I said Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s arrival by the early train was\r\nentirely attributable to one of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s freaks. Being asked,\r\nupon that, whether his galloping off again on horseback was another of\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s freaks, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was;\xe2\x80\x9d and slipped out of it\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthink very cleverly\xe2\x80\x94in that way.\r\n\r\nHaving got over my difficulties with the ladies, I found more\r\ndifficulties waiting for me when I went back to my own room. In came\r\nPenelope\xe2\x80\x94with the natural sweetness of women\xe2\x80\x94to kiss and make it up\r\nagain; and\xe2\x80\x94with the natural curiosity of women\xe2\x80\x94to ask another question.\r\nThis time she only wanted me to tell her what was the matter with our\r\nsecond housemaid, Rosanna Spearman.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Mr. Franklin and me at the Shivering Sand, Rosanna, it\r\nappeared, had returned to the house in a very unaccountable state of\r\nmind. She had turned (if Penelope was to be believed) all the colours\r\nof the rainbow. She had been merry without reason, and sad without\r\nreason. In one breath she asked hundreds of questions about Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake, and in another breath she had been angry with Penelope\r\nfor presuming to suppose that a strange gentleman could possess any\r\ninterest for her. She had been surprised, smiling, and scribbling Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s name inside her workbox. She had been surprised again,\r\ncrying and looking at her deformed shoulder in the glass. Had she and\r\nMr. Franklin known anything of each other before today? Quite\r\nimpossible! Had they heard anything of each other? Impossible again! I\r\ncould speak to Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment as genuine, when he saw how\r\nthe girl stared at him. Penelope could speak to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquisitiveness as genuine, when she asked questions about Mr.\r\nFranklin. The conference between us, conducted in this way, was\r\ntiresome enough, until my daughter suddenly ended it by bursting out\r\nwith what I thought the most monstrous supposition I had ever heard in\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope, quite seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s only one explanation\r\nof it. Rosanna has fallen in love with Mr. Franklin Blake at first\r\nsight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou have heard of beautiful young ladies falling in love at first\r\nsight, and have thought it natural enough. But a housemaid out of a\r\nreformatory, with a plain face and a deformed shoulder, falling in\r\nlove, at first sight, with a gentleman who comes on a visit to her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s house, match me that, in the way of an absurdity, out of any\r\nstory-book in Christendom, if you can! I laughed till the tears rolled\r\ndown my cheeks. Penelope resented my merriment, in rather a strange\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cI never knew you cruel before, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, very gently,\r\nand went out.\r\n\r\nMy girl\xe2\x80\x99s words fell upon me like a splash of cold water. I was savage\r\nwith myself, for feeling uneasy in myself the moment she had spoken\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94but so it was. We will change the subject, if you please. I am\r\nsorry I drifted into writing about it; and not without reason, as you\r\nwill see when we have gone on together a little longer.\r\n\r\nThe evening came, and the dressing-bell for dinner rang, before Mr.\r\nFranklin returned from Frizinghall. I took his hot water up to his room\r\nmyself, expecting to hear, after this extraordinary delay, that\r\nsomething had happened. To my great disappointment (and no doubt to\r\nyours also), nothing had happened. He had not met with the Indians,\r\neither going or returning. He had deposited the Moonstone in the\r\nbank\xe2\x80\x94describing it merely as a valuable of great price\xe2\x80\x94and he had got\r\nthe receipt for it safe in his pocket. I went downstairs, feeling that\r\nthis was rather a flat ending, after all our excitement about the\r\nDiamond earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nHow the meeting between Mr. Franklin and his aunt and cousin went off,\r\nis more than I can tell you.\r\n\r\nI would have given something to have waited at table that day. But, in\r\nmy position in the household, waiting at dinner (except on high family\r\nfestivals) was letting down my dignity in the eyes of the other\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x94a thing which my lady considered me quite prone enough to do\r\nalready, without seeking occasions for it. The news brought to me from\r\nthe upper regions, that evening, came from Penelope and the footman.\r\nPenelope mentioned that she had never known Miss Rachel so particular\r\nabout the dressing of her hair, and had never seen her look so bright\r\nand pretty as she did when she went down to meet Mr. Franklin in the\r\ndrawing-room. The footman\xe2\x80\x99s report was, that the preservation of a\r\nrespectful composure in the presence of his betters, and the waiting on\r\nMr. Franklin Blake at dinner, were two of the hardest things to\r\nreconcile with each other that had ever tried his training in service.\r\nLater in the evening, we heard them singing and playing duets, Mr.\r\nFranklin piping high, Miss Rachel piping higher, and my lady, on the\r\npiano, following them as it were over hedge and ditch, and seeing them\r\nsafe through it in a manner most wonderful and pleasant to hear through\r\nthe open windows, on the terrace at night. Later still, I went to Mr.\r\nFranklin in the smoking-room, with the soda water and brandy, and found\r\nthat Miss Rachel had put the Diamond clean out of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmost charming girl I have seen since I came back to England!\xe2\x80\x9d was all I\r\ncould extract from him, when I endeavoured to lead the conversation to\r\nmore serious things.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight, I went round the house to lock up, accompanied by my\r\nsecond in command (Samuel, the footman), as usual. When all the doors\r\nwere made fast, except the side door that opened on the terrace, I sent\r\nSamuel to bed, and stepped out for a breath of fresh air before I too\r\nwent to bed in my turn.\r\n\r\nThe night was still and close, and the moon was at the full in the\r\nheavens. It was so silent out of doors, that I heard from time to time,\r\nvery faint and low, the fall of the sea, as the ground-swell heaved it\r\nin on the sand-bank near the mouth of our little bay. As the house\r\nstood, the terrace side was the dark side; but the broad moonlight\r\nshowed fair on the gravel walk that ran along the next side to the\r\nterrace. Looking this way, after looking up at the sky, I saw the\r\nshadow of a person in the moonlight thrown forward from behind the\r\ncorner of the house.\r\n\r\nBeing old and sly, I forbore to call out; but being also,\r\nunfortunately, old and heavy, my feet betrayed me on the gravel. Before\r\nI could steal suddenly round the corner, as I had proposed, I heard\r\nlighter feet than mine\xe2\x80\x94and more than one pair of them as I\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94retreating in a hurry. By the time I had got to the corner, the\r\ntrespassers, whoever they were, had run into the shrubbery at the off\r\nside of the walk, and were hidden from sight among the thick trees and\r\nbushes in that part of the grounds. From the shrubbery, they could\r\neasily make their way, over our fence into the road. If I had been\r\nforty years younger, I might have had a chance of catching them before\r\nthey got clear of our premises. As it was, I went back to set a-going a\r\nyounger pair of legs than mine. Without disturbing anybody, Samuel and\r\nI got a couple of guns, and went all round the house and through the\r\nshrubbery. Having made sure that no persons were lurking about anywhere\r\nin our grounds, we turned back. Passing over the walk where I had seen\r\nthe shadow, I now noticed, for the first time, a little bright object,\r\nlying on the clean gravel, under the light of the moon. Picking the\r\nobject up, I discovered it was a small bottle, containing a thick\r\nsweet-smelling liquor, as black as ink.\r\n\r\nI said nothing to Samuel. But, remembering what Penelope had told me\r\nabout the jugglers, and the pouring of the little pool of ink into the\r\npalm of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, I instantly suspected that I had disturbed the\r\nthree Indians, lurking about the house, and bent, in their heathenish\r\nway, on discovering the whereabouts of the Diamond that night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHere, for one moment, I find it necessary to call a halt.\r\n\r\nOn summoning up my own recollections\xe2\x80\x94and on getting Penelope to help\r\nme, by consulting her journal\xe2\x80\x94I find that we may pass pretty rapidly\r\nover the interval between Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. For the greater part of that time the days passed,\r\nand brought nothing with them worth recording. With your good leave,\r\nthen, and with Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s help, I shall notice certain dates only in\r\nthis place; reserving to myself to tell the story day by day, once\r\nmore, as soon as we get to the time when the business of the Moonstone\r\nbecame the chief business of everybody in our house.\r\n\r\nThis said, we may now go on again\xe2\x80\x94beginning, of course, with the bottle\r\nof sweet-smelling ink which I found on the gravel walk at night.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning (the morning of the twenty-sixth) I showed Mr.\r\nFranklin this article of jugglery, and told him what I have already\r\ntold you. His opinion was, not only that the Indians had been lurking\r\nabout after the Diamond, but also that they were actually foolish\r\nenough to believe in their own magic\xe2\x80\x94meaning thereby the making of\r\nsigns on a boy\xe2\x80\x99s head, and the pouring of ink into a boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and\r\nthen expecting him to see persons and things beyond the reach of human\r\nvision. In our country, as well as in the East, Mr. Franklin informed\r\nme, there are people who practise this curious hocus-pocus (without the\r\nink, however); and who call it by a French name, signifying something\r\nlike brightness of sight. \xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nIndians took it for granted that we should keep the Diamond here; and\r\nthey brought their clairvoyant boy to show them the way to it, if they\r\nsucceeded in getting into the house last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think they\xe2\x80\x99ll try again, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9con what the boy can really do. If he\r\ncan see the Diamond through the iron safe of the bank at Frizinghall,\r\nwe shall be troubled with no more visits from the Indians for the\r\npresent. If he can\xe2\x80\x99t, we shall have another chance of catching them in\r\nthe shrubbery, before many more nights are over our heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI waited pretty confidently for that latter chance; but, strange to\r\nrelate, it never came.\r\n\r\nWhether the jugglers heard, in the town, of Mr. Franklin having been\r\nseen at the bank, and drew their conclusions accordingly; or whether\r\nthe boy really did see the Diamond where the Diamond was now lodged\r\n(which I, for one, flatly disbelieve); or whether, after all, it was a\r\nmere effect of chance, this at any rate is the plain truth\xe2\x80\x94not the\r\nghost of an Indian came near the house again, through the weeks that\r\npassed before Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. The jugglers remained in and\r\nabout the town plying their trade; and Mr. Franklin and I remained\r\nwaiting to see what might happen, and resolute not to put the rogues on\r\ntheir guard by showing our suspicions of them too soon. With this\r\nreport of the proceedings on either side, ends all that I have to say\r\nabout the Indians for the present.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of the month, Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin hit on a\r\nnew method of working their way together through the time which might\r\notherwise have hung heavy on their hands. There are reasons for taking\r\nparticular notice here of the occupation that amused them. You will\r\nfind it has a bearing on something that is still to come.\r\n\r\nGentlefolks in general have a very awkward rock ahead in life\xe2\x80\x94the rock\r\nahead of their own idleness. Their lives being, for the most part,\r\npassed in looking about them for something to do, it is curious to\r\nsee\xe2\x80\x94especially when their tastes are of what is called the intellectual\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94how often they drift blindfold into some nasty pursuit. Nine times\r\nout of ten they take to torturing something, or to spoiling\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94and they firmly believe they are improving their minds, when\r\nthe plain truth is, they are only making a mess in the house. I have\r\nseen them (ladies, I am sorry to say, as well as gentlemen) go out, day\r\nafter day, for example, with empty pill-boxes, and catch newts, and\r\nbeetles, and spiders, and frogs, and come home and stick pins through\r\nthe miserable wretches, or cut them up, without a pang of remorse, into\r\nlittle pieces. You see my young master, or my young mistress, poring\r\nover one of their spiders\xe2\x80\x99 insides with a magnifying-glass; or you meet\r\none of their frogs walking downstairs without his head\xe2\x80\x94and when you\r\nwonder what this cruel nastiness means, you are told that it means a\r\ntaste in my young master or my young mistress for natural history.\r\nSometimes, again, you see them occupied for hours together in spoiling\r\na pretty flower with pointed instruments, out of a stupid curiosity to\r\nknow what the flower is made of. Is its colour any prettier, or its\r\nscent any sweeter, when you _do_ know? But there! the poor souls must\r\nget through the time, you see\xe2\x80\x94they must get through the time. You\r\ndabbled in nasty mud, and made pies, when you were a child; and you\r\ndabble in nasty science, and dissect spiders, and spoil flowers, when\r\nyou grow up. In the one case and in the other, the secret of it is,\r\nthat you have got nothing to think of in your poor empty head, and\r\nnothing to do with your poor idle hands. And so it ends in your\r\nspoiling canvas with paints, and making a smell in the house; or in\r\nkeeping tadpoles in a glass box full of dirty water, and turning\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s stomach in the house; or in chipping off bits of stone\r\nhere, there, and everywhere, and dropping grit into all the victuals in\r\nthe house; or in staining your fingers in the pursuit of photography,\r\nand doing justice without mercy on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s face in the house. It\r\noften falls heavy enough, no doubt, on people who are really obliged to\r\nget their living, to be forced to work for the clothes that cover them,\r\nthe roof that shelters them, and the food that keeps them going. But\r\ncompare the hardest day\xe2\x80\x99s work you ever did with the idleness that\r\nsplits flowers and pokes its way into spiders\xe2\x80\x99 stomachs, and thank your\r\nstars that your head has got something it _must_ think of, and your\r\nhands something that they _must_ do.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel, they tortured nothing, I am glad\r\nto say. They simply confined themselves to making a mess; and all they\r\nspoilt, to do them justice, was the panelling of a door.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s universal genius, dabbling in everything, dabbled in\r\nwhat he called \xe2\x80\x9cdecorative painting.\xe2\x80\x9d He had invented, he informed us,\r\na new mixture to moisten paint with, which he described as a \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWhat it was made of, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What it did, I can tell you in two\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94it stank. Miss Rachel being wild to try her hand at the new\r\nprocess, Mr. Franklin sent to London for the materials; mixed them up,\r\nwith accompaniment of a smell which made the very dogs sneeze when they\r\ncame into the room; put an apron and a bib over Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s gown, and\r\nset her to work decorating her own little sitting-room\xe2\x80\x94called, for want\r\nof English to name it in, her \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d They began with the inside of\r\nthe door. Mr. Franklin scraped off all the nice varnish with\r\npumice-stone, and made what he described as a surface to work on. Miss\r\nRachel then covered the surface, under his directions and with his\r\nhelp, with patterns and devices\xe2\x80\x94griffins, birds, flowers, cupids, and\r\nsuch like\xe2\x80\x94copied from designs made by a famous Italian painter, whose\r\nname escapes me: the one, I mean, who stocked the world with Virgin\r\nMaries, and had a sweetheart at the baker\xe2\x80\x99s. Viewed as work, this\r\ndecoration was slow to do, and dirty to deal with. But our young lady\r\nand gentleman never seemed to tire of it. When they were not riding, or\r\nseeing company, or taking their meals, or piping their songs, there\r\nthey were with their heads together, as busy as bees, spoiling the\r\ndoor. Who was the poet who said that Satan finds some mischief still\r\nfor idle hands to do? If he had occupied my place in the family, and\r\nhad seen Miss Rachel with her brush, and Mr. Franklin with his vehicle,\r\nhe could have written nothing truer of either of them than that.\r\n\r\nThe next date worthy of notice is Sunday the fourth of June.\r\n\r\nOn that evening we, in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, debated a domestic question\r\nfor the first time, which, like the decoration of the door, has its\r\nbearing on something that is still to come.\r\n\r\nSeeing the pleasure which Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel took in each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s society, and noting what a pretty match they were in all\r\npersonal respects, we naturally speculated on the chance of their\r\nputting their heads together with other objects in view besides the\r\nornamenting of a door. Some of us said there would be a wedding in the\r\nhouse before the summer was over. Others (led by me) admitted it was\r\nlikely enough Miss Rachel might be married; but we doubted (for reasons\r\nwhich will presently appear) whether her bridegroom would be Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Franklin was in love, on his side, nobody who saw and heard\r\nhim could doubt. The difficulty was to fathom Miss Rachel. Let me do\r\nmyself the honour of making you acquainted with her; after which, I\r\nwill leave you to fathom for yourself\xe2\x80\x94if you can.\r\n\r\nMy young lady\xe2\x80\x99s eighteenth birthday was the birthday now coming, on the\r\ntwenty-first of June. If you happen to like dark women (who, I am\r\ninformed, have gone out of fashion latterly in the gay world), and if\r\nyou have no particular prejudice in favour of size, I answer for Miss\r\nRachel as one of the prettiest girls your eyes ever looked on. She was\r\nsmall and slim, but all in fine proportion from top to toe. To see her\r\nsit down, to see her get up, and specially to see her walk, was enough\r\nto satisfy any man in his senses that the graces of her figure (if you\r\nwill pardon me the expression) were in her flesh and not in her\r\nclothes. Her hair was the blackest I ever saw. Her eyes matched her\r\nhair. Her nose was not quite large enough, I admit. Her mouth and chin\r\nwere (to quote Mr. Franklin) morsels for the gods; and her complexion\r\n(on the same undeniable authority) was as warm as the sun itself, with\r\nthis great advantage over the sun, that it was always in nice order to\r\nlook at. Add to the foregoing that she carried her head as upright as a\r\ndart, in a dashing, spirited, thoroughbred way\xe2\x80\x94that she had a clear\r\nvoice, with a ring of the right metal in it, and a smile that began\r\nvery prettily in her eyes before it got to her lips\xe2\x80\x94and there behold\r\nthe portrait of her, to the best of my painting, as large as life!\r\n\r\nAnd what about her disposition next? Had this charming creature no\r\nfaults? She had just as many faults as you have, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94neither more nor\r\nless.\r\n\r\nTo put it seriously, my dear pretty Miss Rachel, possessing a host of\r\ngraces and attractions, had one defect, which strict impartiality\r\ncompels me to acknowledge. She was unlike most other girls of her age,\r\nin this\xe2\x80\x94that she had ideas of her own, and was stiff-necked enough to\r\nset the fashions themselves at defiance, if the fashions didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit\r\nher views. In trifles, this independence of hers was all well enough;\r\nbut in matters of importance, it carried her (as my lady thought, and\r\nas I thought) too far. She judged for herself, as few women of twice\r\nher age judge in general; never asked your advice; never told you\r\nbeforehand what she was going to do; never came with secrets and\r\nconfidences to anybody, from her mother downwards. In little things and\r\ngreat, with people she loved, and people she hated (and she did both\r\nwith equal heartiness), Miss Rachel always went on a way of her own,\r\nsufficient for herself in the joys and sorrows of her life. Over and\r\nover again I have heard my lady say, \xe2\x80\x9cRachel\xe2\x80\x99s best friend and Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworst enemy are, one and the other\xe2\x80\x94Rachel herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdd one thing more to this, and I have done.\r\n\r\nWith all her secrecy, and self-will, there was not so much as the\r\nshadow of anything false in her. I never remember her breaking her\r\nword; I never remember her saying No, and meaning Yes. I can call to\r\nmind, in her childhood, more than one occasion when the good little\r\nsoul took the blame, and suffered the punishment, for some fault\r\ncommitted by a playfellow whom she loved. Nobody ever knew her to\r\nconfess to it, when the thing was found out, and she was charged with\r\nit afterwards. But nobody ever knew her to lie about it, either. She\r\nlooked you straight in the face, and shook her little saucy head, and\r\nsaid plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d Punished again for this, she would\r\nown to being sorry for saying \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t;\xe2\x80\x9d but, bread and water\r\nnotwithstanding, she never told you. Self-willed\xe2\x80\x94devilish self-willed\r\nsometimes\xe2\x80\x94I grant; but the finest creature, nevertheless, that ever\r\nwalked the ways of this lower world. Perhaps you think you see a\r\ncertain contradiction here? In that case, a word in your ear. Study\r\nyour wife closely, for the next four-and-twenty hours. If your good\r\nlady doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exhibit something in the shape of a contradiction in that\r\ntime, Heaven help you!\xe2\x80\x94you have married a monster.\r\n\r\nI have now brought you acquainted with Miss Rachel, which you will find\r\nputs us face to face, next, with the question of that young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmatrimonial views.\r\n\r\nOn June the twelfth, an invitation from my mistress was sent to a\r\ngentleman in London, to come and help to keep Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\r\nThis was the fortunate individual on whom I believed her heart to be\r\nprivately set! Like Mr. Franklin, he was a cousin of hers. His name was\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\r\n\r\nMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s second sister (don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed; we are not going very deep\r\ninto family matters this time)\xe2\x80\x94my lady\xe2\x80\x99s second sister, I say, had a\r\ndisappointment in love; and taking a husband afterwards, on the neck or\r\nnothing principle, made what they call a misalliance. There was\r\nterrible work in the family when the Honourable Caroline insisted on\r\nmarrying plain Mr. Ablewhite, the banker at Frizinghall. He was very\r\nrich and very respectable, and he begot a prodigious large family\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nin his favour, so far. But he had presumed to raise himself from a low\r\nstation in the world\xe2\x80\x94and that was against him. However, Time and the\r\nprogress of modern enlightenment put things right; and the misalliance\r\npassed muster very well. We are all getting liberal now; and (provided\r\nyou can scratch me, if I scratch you) what do I care, in or out of\r\nParliament, whether you are a Dustman or a Duke? That\xe2\x80\x99s the modern way\r\nof looking at it\xe2\x80\x94and I keep up with the modern way. The Ablewhites\r\nlived in a fine house and grounds, a little out of Frizinghall. Very\r\nworthy people, and greatly respected in the neighbourhood. We shall not\r\nbe much troubled with them in these pages\xe2\x80\x94excepting Mr. Godfrey, who\r\nwas Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s second son, and who must take his proper place\r\nhere, if you please, for Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nWith all his brightness and cleverness and general good qualities, Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s chance of topping Mr. Godfrey in our young lady\xe2\x80\x99s estimation\r\nwas, in my opinion, a very poor chance indeed.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Mr. Godfrey was, in point of size, the finest man\r\nby far of the two. He stood over six feet high; he had a beautiful red\r\nand white colour; a smooth round face, shaved as bare as your hand; and\r\na head of lovely long flaxen hair, falling negligently over the poll of\r\nhis neck. But why do I try to give you this personal description of\r\nhim? If you ever subscribed to a Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Charity in London, you know\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite as well as I do. He was a barrister by\r\nprofession; a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 man by temperament; and a good Samaritan by\r\nchoice. Female benevolence and female destitution could do nothing\r\nwithout him. Maternal societies for confining poor women; Magdalen\r\nsocieties for rescuing poor women; strong-minded societies for putting\r\npoor women into poor men\xe2\x80\x99s places, and leaving the men to shift for\r\nthemselves;\xe2\x80\x94he was vice-president, manager, referee to them all.\r\nWherever there was a table with a committee of ladies sitting round it\r\nin council there was Mr. Godfrey at the bottom of the board, keeping\r\nthe temper of the committee, and leading the dear creatures along the\r\nthorny ways of business, hat in hand. I do suppose this was the most\r\naccomplished philanthropist (on a small independence) that England ever\r\nproduced. As a speaker at charitable meetings the like of him for\r\ndrawing your tears and your money was not easy to find. He was quite a\r\npublic character. The last time I was in London, my mistress gave me\r\ntwo treats. She sent me to the theatre to see a dancing woman who was\r\nall the rage; and she sent me to Exeter Hall to hear Mr. Godfrey. The\r\nlady did it, with a band of music. The gentleman did it, with a\r\nhandkerchief and a glass of water. Crowds at the performance with the\r\nlegs. Ditto at the performance with the tongue. And with all this, the\r\nsweetest tempered person (I allude to Mr. Godfrey)\xe2\x80\x94the simplest and\r\npleasantest and easiest to please\xe2\x80\x94you ever met with. He loved\r\neverybody. And everybody loved _him_. What chance had Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nchance had anybody of average reputation and capacities\xe2\x80\x94against such a\r\nman as this?\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth, came Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\nHe accepted my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, from the Wednesday of the\r\nbirthday to the evening of Friday\xe2\x80\x94when his duties to the Ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCharities would oblige him to return to town. He also enclosed a copy\r\nof verses on what he elegantly called his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnatal day.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss\r\nRachel, I was informed, joined Mr. Franklin in making fun of the verses\r\nat dinner; and Penelope, who was all on Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s side, asked me,\r\nin great triumph, what I thought of that. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Rachel has led _you_\r\noff on a false scent, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut _my_ nose is not so\r\neasily mystified. Wait till Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s verses are followed by Mr.\r\nAblewhite himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy daughter replied, that Mr. Franklin might strike in, and try his\r\nluck, before the verses were followed by the poet. In favour of this\r\nview, I must acknowledge that Mr. Franklin left no chance untried of\r\nwinning Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s good graces.\r\n\r\nThough one of the most inveterate smokers I ever met with, he gave up\r\nhis cigar, because she said, one day, she hated the stale smell of it\r\nin his clothes. He slept so badly, after this effort of self-denial,\r\nfor want of the composing effect of the tobacco to which he was used,\r\nand came down morning after morning looking so haggard and worn, that\r\nMiss Rachel herself begged him to take to his cigars again. No! he\r\nwould take to nothing again that could cause her a moment\xe2\x80\x99s annoyance;\r\nhe would fight it out resolutely, and get back his sleep, sooner or\r\nlater, by main force of patience in waiting for it. Such devotion as\r\nthis, you may say (as some of them said downstairs), could never fail\r\nof producing the right effect on Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x94backed up, too, as it was,\r\nby the decorating work every day on the door. All very well\xe2\x80\x94but she had\r\na photograph of Mr. Godfrey in her bedroom; represented speaking at a\r\npublic meeting, with all his hair blown out by the breath of his own\r\neloquence, and his eyes, most lovely, charming the money out of your\r\npockets. What do you say to that? Every morning\xe2\x80\x94as Penelope herself\r\nowned to me\xe2\x80\x94there was the man whom the women couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without,\r\nlooking on, in effigy, while Miss Rachel was having her hair combed. He\r\nwould be looking on, in reality, before long\xe2\x80\x94that was my opinion of it.\r\n\r\nJune the sixteenth brought an event which made Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s chance\r\nlook, to my mind, a worse chance than ever.\r\n\r\nA strange gentleman, speaking English with a foreign accent, came that\r\nmorning to the house, and asked to see Mr. Franklin Blake on business.\r\nThe business could not possibly have been connected with the Diamond,\r\nfor these two reasons\xe2\x80\x94first, that Mr. Franklin told me nothing about\r\nit; secondly, that he communicated it (when the gentleman had gone, as\r\nI suppose) to my lady. She probably hinted something about it next to\r\nher daughter. At any rate, Miss Rachel was reported to have said some\r\nsevere things to Mr. Franklin, at the piano that evening, about the\r\npeople he had lived among, and the principles he had adopted in foreign\r\nparts. The next day, for the first time, nothing was done towards the\r\ndecoration of the door. I suspect some imprudence of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nthe Continent\xe2\x80\x94with a woman or a debt at the bottom of it\xe2\x80\x94had followed\r\nhim to England. But that is all guesswork. In this case, not only Mr.\r\nFranklin, but my lady too, for a wonder, left me in the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth, to all appearance, the cloud passed away again.\r\nThey returned to their decorating work on the door, and seemed to be as\r\ngood friends as ever. If Penelope was to be believed, Mr. Franklin had\r\nseized the opportunity of the reconciliation to make an offer to Miss\r\nRachel, and had neither been accepted nor refused. My girl was sure\r\n(from signs and tokens which I need not trouble you with) that her\r\nyoung mistress had fought Mr. Franklin off by declining to believe that\r\nhe was in earnest, and had then secretly regretted treating him in that\r\nway afterwards. Though Penelope was admitted to more familiarity with\r\nher young mistress than maids generally are\xe2\x80\x94for the two had been almost\r\nbrought up together as children\xe2\x80\x94still I knew Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s reserved\r\ncharacter too well to believe that she would show her mind to anybody\r\nin this way. What my daughter told me, on the present occasion, was, as\r\nI suspected, more what she wished than what she really knew.\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth another event happened. We had the doctor in the\r\nhouse professionally. He was summoned to prescribe for a person whom I\r\nhave had occasion to present to you in these pages\xe2\x80\x94our second\r\nhousemaid, Rosanna Spearman.\r\n\r\nThis poor girl\xe2\x80\x94who had puzzled me, as you know already, at the\r\nShivering Sand\xe2\x80\x94puzzled me more than once again, in the interval time of\r\nwhich I am now writing. Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s notion that her fellow-servant was\r\nin love with Mr. Franklin (which my daughter, by my orders, kept\r\nstrictly secret) seemed to be just as absurd as ever. But I must own\r\nthat what I myself saw, and what my daughter saw also, of our second\r\nhousemaid\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, began to look mysterious, to say the least of it.\r\n\r\nFor example, the girl constantly put herself in Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s way\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nslyly and quietly, but she did it. He took about as much notice of her\r\nas he took of the cat; it never seemed to occur to him to waste a look\r\non Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s plain face. The poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s appetite, never much, fell\r\naway dreadfully; and her eyes in the morning showed plain signs of\r\nwaking and crying at night. One day Penelope made an awkward discovery,\r\nwhich we hushed up on the spot. She caught Rosanna at Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing-table, secretly removing a rose which Miss Rachel had given\r\nhim to wear in his button-hole, and putting another rose like it, of\r\nher own picking, in its place. She was, after that, once or twice\r\nimpudent to me, when I gave her a well-meant general hint to be careful\r\nin her conduct; and, worse still, she was not over-respectful now, on\r\nthe few occasions when Miss Rachel accidentally spoke to her.\r\n\r\nMy lady noticed the change, and asked me what I thought about it. I\r\ntried to screen the girl by answering that I thought she was out of\r\nhealth; and it ended in the doctor being sent for, as already\r\nmentioned, on the nineteenth. He said it was her nerves, and doubted if\r\nshe was fit for service. My lady offered to remove her for change of\r\nair to one of our farms, inland. She begged and prayed, with the tears\r\nin her eyes, to be let to stop; and, in an evil hour, I advised my lady\r\nto try her for a little longer. As the event proved, and as you will\r\nsoon see, this was the worst advice I could have given. If I could only\r\nhave looked a little way into the future, I would have taken Rosanna\r\nSpearman out of the house, then and there, with my own hand.\r\n\r\nOn the twentieth, there came a note from Mr. Godfrey. He had arranged\r\nto stop at Frizinghall that night, having occasion to consult his\r\nfather on business. On the afternoon of the next day, he and his two\r\neldest sisters would ride over to us on horseback, in good time before\r\ndinner. An elegant little casket in china accompanied the note,\r\npresented to Miss Rachel, with her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s love and best wishes. Mr.\r\nFranklin had only given her a plain locket not worth half the money. My\r\ndaughter Penelope, nevertheless\xe2\x80\x94such is the obstinacy of women\xe2\x80\x94still\r\nbacked him to win.\r\n\r\nThanks be to Heaven, we have arrived at the eve of the birthday at\r\nlast! You will own, I think, that I have got you over the ground this\r\ntime, without much loitering by the way. Cheer up! I\xe2\x80\x99ll ease you with\r\nanother new chapter here\xe2\x80\x94and, what is more, that chapter shall take you\r\nstraight into the thick of the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nJune twenty-first, the day of the birthday, was cloudy and unsettled at\r\nsunrise, but towards noon it cleared up bravely.\r\n\r\nWe, in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, began this happy anniversary, as usual, by\r\noffering our little presents to Miss Rachel, with the regular speech\r\ndelivered annually by me as the chief. I follow the plan adopted by the\r\nQueen in opening Parliament\xe2\x80\x94namely, the plan of saying much the same\r\nthing regularly every year. Before it is delivered, my speech (like the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s) is looked for as eagerly as if nothing of the kind had ever\r\nbeen heard before. When it is delivered, and turns out not to be the\r\nnovelty anticipated, though they grumble a little, they look forward\r\nhopefully to something newer next year. An easy people to govern, in\r\nthe Parliament and in the Kitchen\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the moral of it.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, Mr. Franklin and I had a private conference on the\r\nsubject of the Moonstone\xe2\x80\x94the time having now come for removing it from\r\nthe bank at Frizinghall, and placing it in Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s own hands.\r\n\r\nWhether he had been trying to make love to his cousin again, and had\r\ngot a rebuff\xe2\x80\x94or whether his broken rest, night after night, was\r\naggravating the queer contradictions and uncertainties in his\r\ncharacter\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But certain it is, that Mr. Franklin failed to\r\nshow himself at his best on the morning of the birthday. He was in\r\ntwenty different minds about the Diamond in as many minutes. For my\r\npart, I stuck fast by the plain facts as we knew them. Nothing had\r\nhappened to justify us in alarming my lady on the subject of the jewel;\r\nand nothing could alter the legal obligation that now lay on Mr.\r\nFranklin to put it in his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s possession. That was my view of the\r\nmatter; and, twist and turn it as he might, he was forced in the end to\r\nmake it his view too. We arranged that he was to ride over, after\r\nlunch, to Frizinghall, and bring the Diamond back, with Mr. Godfrey and\r\nthe two young ladies, in all probability, to keep him company on the\r\nway home again.\r\n\r\nThis settled, our young gentleman went back to Miss Rachel.\r\n\r\nThey consumed the whole morning, and part of the afternoon, in the\r\neverlasting business of decorating the door, Penelope standing by to\r\nmix the colours, as directed; and my lady, as luncheon time drew near,\r\ngoing in and out of the room, with her handkerchief to her nose (for\r\nthey used a deal of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle that day), and trying vainly\r\nto get the two artists away from their work. It was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nbefore they took off their aprons, and released Penelope (much the\r\nworse for the vehicle), and cleaned themselves of their mess. But they\r\nhad done what they wanted\xe2\x80\x94they had finished the door on the birthday,\r\nand proud enough they were of it. The griffins, cupids, and so on,\r\nwere, I must own, most beautiful to behold; though so many in number,\r\nso entangled in flowers and devices, and so topsy-turvy in their\r\nactions and attitudes, that you felt them unpleasantly in your head for\r\nhours after you had done with the pleasure of looking at them. If I add\r\nthat Penelope ended her part of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s work by being sick in the\r\nback-kitchen, it is in no unfriendly spirit towards the vehicle. No!\r\nno! It left off stinking when it dried; and if Art requires these sort\r\nof sacrifices\xe2\x80\x94though the girl is my own daughter\xe2\x80\x94I say, let Art have\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin snatched a morsel from the luncheon-table, and rode off to\r\nFrizinghall\xe2\x80\x94to escort his cousins, as he told my lady. To fetch the\r\nMoonstone, as was privately known to himself and to me.\r\n\r\nThis being one of the high festivals on which I took my place at the\r\nside-board, in command of the attendance at table, I had plenty to\r\noccupy my mind while Mr. Franklin was away. Having seen to the wine,\r\nand reviewed my men and women who were to wait at dinner, I retired to\r\ncollect myself before the company came. A whiff of\xe2\x80\x94you know what, and a\r\nturn at a certain book which I have had occasion to mention in these\r\npages, composed me, body and mind. I was aroused from what I am\r\ninclined to think must have been, not a nap, but a reverie, by the\r\nclatter of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs outside; and, going to the door, received a\r\ncavalcade comprising Mr. Franklin and his three cousins, escorted by\r\none of old Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s grooms.\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey struck me, strangely enough, as being like Mr. Franklin in\r\nthis respect\xe2\x80\x94that he did not seem to be in his customary spirits. He\r\nkindly shook hands with me as usual, and was most politely glad to see\r\nhis old friend Betteredge wearing so well. But there was a sort of\r\ncloud over him, which I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t at all account for; and when I asked\r\nhow he had found his father in health, he answered rather shortly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d However, the two Miss Ablewhites were cheerful enough\r\nfor twenty, which more than restored the balance. They were nearly as\r\nbig as their brother; spanking, yellow-haired, rosy lasses, overflowing\r\nwith super-abundant flesh and blood; bursting from head to foot with\r\nhealth and spirits. The legs of the poor horses trembled with carrying\r\nthem; and when they jumped from their saddles (without waiting to be\r\nhelped), I declare they bounced on the ground as if they were made of\r\nindia-rubber. Everything the Miss Ablewhites said began with a large O;\r\neverything they did was done with a bang; and they giggled and\r\nscreamed, in season and out of season, on the smallest provocation.\r\nBouncers\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call them.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of the noise made by the young ladies, I had an opportunity\r\nof saying a private word to Mr. Franklin in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the Diamond safe, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and tapped the breast-pocket of his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen anything of the Indians?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a glimpse.\xe2\x80\x9d With that answer, he asked for my lady, and, hearing\r\nshe was in the small drawing-room, went there straight. The bell rang,\r\nbefore he had been a minute in the room, and Penelope was sent to tell\r\nMiss Rachel that Mr. Franklin Blake wanted to speak to her.\r\n\r\nCrossing the hall, about half an hour afterwards, I was brought to a\r\nsudden standstill by an outbreak of screams from the small\r\ndrawing-room. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I was at all alarmed; for I recognised in the\r\nscreams the favourite large O of the Miss Ablewhites. However, I went\r\nin (on pretence of asking for instructions about the dinner) to\r\ndiscover whether anything serious had really happened.\r\n\r\nThere stood Miss Rachel at the table, like a person fascinated, with\r\nthe Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky Diamond in her hand. There, on either side of\r\nher, knelt the two Bouncers, devouring the jewel with their eyes, and\r\nscreaming with ecstasy every time it flashed on them in a new light.\r\nThere, at the opposite side of the table, stood Mr. Godfrey, clapping\r\nhis hands like a large child, and singing out softly, \xe2\x80\x9cExquisite!\r\nexquisite!\xe2\x80\x9d There sat Mr. Franklin in a chair by the bookcase, tugging\r\nat his beard, and looking anxiously towards the window. And there, at\r\nthe window, stood the object he was contemplating\xe2\x80\x94my lady, having the\r\nextract from the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Will in her hand, and keeping her back\r\nturned on the whole of the company.\r\n\r\nShe faced me, when I asked for my instructions; and I saw the family\r\nfrown gathering over her eyes, and the family temper twitching at the\r\ncorners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to my room in half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have\r\nsomething to say to you then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, she went out. It was plain enough that she was posed\r\nby the same difficulty which had posed Mr. Franklin and me in our\r\nconference at the Shivering Sand. Was the legacy of the Moonstone a\r\nproof that she had treated her brother with cruel injustice? or was it\r\na proof that he was worse than the worst she had ever thought of him?\r\nSerious questions those for my lady to determine, while her daughter,\r\ninnocent of all knowledge of the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s character, stood there with\r\nthe Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s birthday gift in her hand.\r\n\r\nBefore I could leave the room in my turn, Miss Rachel, always\r\nconsiderate to the old servant who had been in the house when she was\r\nborn, stopped me. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, Gabriel!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and flashed the jewel\r\nbefore my eyes in a ray of sunlight that poured through the window.\r\n\r\nLord bless us! it _was_ a Diamond! As large, or nearly, as a plover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\negg! The light that streamed from it was like the light of the harvest\r\nmoon. When you looked down into the stone, you looked into a yellow\r\ndeep that drew your eyes into it so that they saw nothing else. It\r\nseemed unfathomable; this jewel, that you could hold between your\r\nfinger and thumb, seemed unfathomable as the heavens themselves. We set\r\nit in the sun, and then shut the light out of the room, and it shone\r\nawfully out of the depths of its own brightness, with a moony gleam, in\r\nthe dark. No wonder Miss Rachel was fascinated: no wonder her cousins\r\nscreamed. The Diamond laid such a hold on _me_ that I burst out with as\r\nlarge an \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x9d as the Bouncers themselves. The only one of us who kept\r\nhis senses was Mr. Godfrey. He put an arm round each of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaists, and, looking compassionately backwards and forwards between the\r\nDiamond and me, said, \xe2\x80\x9cCarbon Betteredge! mere carbon, my good friend,\r\nafter all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis object, I suppose, was to instruct me. All he did, however, was to\r\nremind me of the dinner. I hobbled off to my army of waiters\r\ndownstairs. As I went out, Mr. Godfrey said, \xe2\x80\x9cDear old Betteredge, I\r\nhave the truest regard for him!\xe2\x80\x9d He was embracing his sisters, and\r\nogling Miss Rachel, while he honoured me with that testimony of\r\naffection. Something like a stock of love to draw on _there!_ Mr.\r\nFranklin was a perfect savage by comparison with him.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour, I presented myself, as directed, in my\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between my mistress and me, on this occasion, was, in the\r\nmain, a repetition of what had passed between Mr. Franklin and me at\r\nthe Shivering Sand\xe2\x80\x94with this difference, that I took care to keep my\r\nown counsel about the jugglers, seeing that nothing had happened to\r\njustify me in alarming my lady on this head. When I received my\r\ndismissal, I could see that she took the blackest view possible of the\r\nColonel\xe2\x80\x99s motives, and that she was bent on getting the Moonstone out\r\nof her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s possession at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nOn my way back to my own part of the house, I was encountered by Mr.\r\nFranklin. He wanted to know if I had seen anything of his cousin\r\nRachel. I had seen nothing of her. Could I tell him where his cousin\r\nGodfrey was? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; but I began to suspect that cousin Godfrey\r\nmight not be far away from cousin Rachel. Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions\r\napparently took the same turn. He tugged hard at his beard, and went\r\nand shut himself up in the library with a bang of the door that had a\r\nworld of meaning in it.\r\n\r\nI was interrupted no more in the business of preparing for the birthday\r\ndinner till it was time for me to smarten myself up for receiving the\r\ncompany. Just as I had got my white waistcoat on, Penelope presented\r\nherself at my toilet, on pretence of brushing what little hair I have\r\ngot left, and improving the tie of my white cravat. My girl was in high\r\nspirits, and I saw she had something to say to me. She gave me a kiss\r\non the top of my bald head, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cNews for you, father! Miss\r\nRachel has refused him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98_him_\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ladies\xe2\x80\x99 committee-man, father,\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope. \xe2\x80\x9cA nasty sly\r\nfellow! I hate him for trying to supplant Mr. Franklin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf I had had breath enough, I should certainly have protested against\r\nthis indecent way of speaking of an eminent philanthropic character.\r\nBut my daughter happened to be improving the tie of my cravat at that\r\nmoment, and the whole strength of her feelings found its way into her\r\nfingers. I never was more nearly strangled in my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him take her away alone into the rose-garden,\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I waited behind the holly to see how they came back. They had gone\r\nout arm-in-arm, both laughing. They came back, walking separate, as\r\ngrave as grave could be, and looking straight away from each other in a\r\nmanner which there was no mistaking. I never was more delighted,\r\nfather, in my life! There\xe2\x80\x99s one woman in the world who can resist Mr.\r\nGodfrey Ablewhite, at any rate; and, if I was a lady, I should be\r\nanother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I should have protested again. But my daughter had got the\r\nhair-brush by this time, and the whole strength of her feelings had\r\npassed into _that_. If you are bald, you will understand how she\r\nsacrificed me. If you are not, skip this bit, and thank God you have\r\ngot something in the way of a defence between your hair-brush and your\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust on the other side of the holly,\xe2\x80\x9d Penelope went on, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Godfrey\r\ncame to a standstill. \xe2\x80\x98You prefer,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98that I should stop here\r\nas if nothing had happened?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Rachel turned on him like lightning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have accepted my mother\xe2\x80\x99s invitation,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98and you are here\r\nto meet her guests. Unless you wish to make a scandal in the house, you\r\nwill remain, of course!\xe2\x80\x99 She went on a few steps, and then seemed to\r\nrelent a little. \xe2\x80\x98Let us forget what has passed, Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and let us remain cousins still.\xe2\x80\x99 She gave him her hand. He kissed it,\r\nwhich _I_ should have considered taking a liberty, and then she left\r\nhim. He waited a little by himself, with his head down, and his heel\r\ngrinding a hole slowly in the gravel walk; you never saw a man look\r\nmore put out in your life. \xe2\x80\x98Awkward!\xe2\x80\x99 he said between his teeth, when\r\nhe looked up, and went on to the house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98very awkward!\xe2\x80\x99 If that was his\r\nopinion of himself, he was quite right. Awkward enough, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. And\r\nthe end of it is, father, what I told you all along,\xe2\x80\x9d cries Penelope,\r\nfinishing me off with a last scarification, the hottest of all. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got possession of the hair-brush, and opened my lips to administer\r\nthe reproof which, you will own, my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s language and conduct\r\nrichly deserved.\r\n\r\nBefore I could say a word, the crash of carriage-wheels outside struck\r\nin, and stopped me. The first of the dinner-company had come. Penelope\r\ninstantly ran off. I put on my coat, and looked in the glass. My head\r\nwas as red as a lobster; but, in other respects, I was as nicely\r\ndressed for the ceremonies of the evening as a man need be. I got into\r\nthe hall just in time to announce the two first of the guests. You\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t feel particularly interested about them. Only the\r\nphilanthropist\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother\xe2\x80\x94Mr. and Mrs. Ablewhite.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nOne on the top of the other the rest of the company followed the\r\nAblewhites, till we had the whole tale of them complete. Including the\r\nfamily, they were twenty-four in all. It was a noble sight to see, when\r\nthey were settled in their places round the dinner-table, and the\r\nRector of Frizinghall (with beautiful elocution) rose and said grace.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to worry you with a list of the guests. You will meet\r\nnone of them a second time\xe2\x80\x94in my part of the story, at any rate\xe2\x80\x94with\r\nthe exception of two.\r\n\r\nThose two sat on either side of Miss Rachel, who, as queen of the day,\r\nwas naturally the great attraction of the party. On this occasion she\r\nwas more particularly the centre-point towards which everybody\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nwere directed; for (to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s secret annoyance) she wore her\r\nwonderful birthday present, which eclipsed all the rest\xe2\x80\x94the Moonstone.\r\nIt was without any setting when it had been placed in her hands; but\r\nthat universal genius, Mr. Franklin, had contrived, with the help of\r\nhis neat fingers and a little bit of silver wire, to fix it as a brooch\r\nin the bosom of her white dress. Everybody wondered at the prodigious\r\nsize and beauty of the Diamond, as a matter of course. But the only two\r\nof the company who said anything out of the common way about it were\r\nthose two guests I have mentioned, who sat by Miss Rachel on her right\r\nhand and her left.\r\n\r\nThe guest on her left was Mr. Candy, our doctor at Frizinghall.\r\n\r\nThis was a pleasant, companionable little man, with the drawback,\r\nhowever, I must own, of being too fond, in season and out of season, of\r\nhis joke, and of his plunging in rather a headlong manner into talk\r\nwith strangers, without waiting to feel his way first. In society, he\r\nwas constantly making mistakes, and setting people unintentionally by\r\nthe ears together. In his medical practice he was a more prudent man;\r\npicking up his discretion (as his enemies said) by a kind of instinct,\r\nand proving to be generally right where more carefully conducted\r\ndoctors turned out to be wrong. What _he_ said about the Diamond to\r\nMiss Rachel was said, as usual, by way of a mystification or joke. He\r\ngravely entreated her (in the interests of science) to let him take it\r\nhome and burn it. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will first heat it, Miss Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\ndoctor, \xe2\x80\x9cto such and such a degree; then we will expose it to a current\r\nof air; and, little by little\xe2\x80\x94puff!\xe2\x80\x94we evaporate the Diamond, and spare\r\nyou a world of anxiety about the safe keeping of a valuable precious\r\nstone!\xe2\x80\x9d My lady, listening with rather a careworn expression on her\r\nface, seemed to wish that the doctor had been in earnest, and that he\r\ncould have found Miss Rachel zealous enough in the cause of science to\r\nsacrifice her birthday gift.\r\n\r\nThe other guest, who sat on my young lady\xe2\x80\x99s right hand, was an eminent\r\npublic character\xe2\x80\x94being no other than the celebrated Indian traveller,\r\nMr. Murthwaite, who, at risk of his life, had penetrated in disguise\r\nwhere no European had ever set foot before.\r\n\r\nThis was a long, lean, wiry, brown, silent man. He had a weary look,\r\nand a very steady, attentive eye. It was rumoured that he was tired of\r\nthe humdrum life among the people in our parts, and longing to go back\r\nand wander off on the tramp again in the wild places of the East.\r\nExcept what he said to Miss Rachel about her jewel, I doubt if he spoke\r\nsix words or drank so much as a single glass of wine, all through the\r\ndinner. The Moonstone was the only object that interested him in the\r\nsmallest degree. The fame of it seemed to have reached him, in some of\r\nthose perilous Indian places where his wanderings had lain. After\r\nlooking at it silently for so long a time that Miss Rachel began to get\r\nconfused, he said to her in his cool immovable way, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever go to\r\nIndia, Miss Verinder, don\xe2\x80\x99t take your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s birthday gift with you. A\r\nHindoo diamond is sometimes part of a Hindoo religion. I know a certain\r\ncity, and a certain temple in that city, where, dressed as you are now,\r\nyour life would not be worth five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 purchase.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Rachel, safe\r\nin England, was quite delighted to hear of her danger in India. The\r\nBouncers were more delighted still; they dropped their knives and forks\r\nwith a crash, and burst out together vehemently, \xe2\x80\x9cO! how interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMy lady fidgeted in her chair, and changed the subject.\r\n\r\nAs the dinner got on, I became aware, little by little, that this\r\nfestival was not prospering as other like festivals had prospered\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the birthday now, by the light of what happened\r\nafterwards, I am half inclined to think that the cursed Diamond must\r\nhave cast a blight on the whole company. I plied them well with wine;\r\nand being a privileged character, followed the unpopular dishes round\r\nthe table, and whispered to the company confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease to\r\nchange your mind and try it; for I know it will do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d Nine\r\ntimes out of ten they changed their minds\xe2\x80\x94out of regard for their old\r\noriginal Betteredge, they were pleased to say\xe2\x80\x94but all to no purpose.\r\nThere were gaps of silence in the talk, as the dinner got on, that made\r\nme feel personally uncomfortable. When they did use their tongues\r\nagain, they used them innocently, in the most unfortunate manner and to\r\nthe worst possible purpose. Mr. Candy, the doctor, for instance, said\r\nmore unlucky things than I ever knew him to say before. Take one sample\r\nof the way in which he went on, and you will understand what I had to\r\nput up with at the sideboard, officiating as I was in the character of\r\na man who had the prosperity of the festival at heart.\r\n\r\nOne of our ladies present at dinner was worthy Mrs. Threadgall, widow\r\nof the late Professor of that name. Talking of her deceased husband\r\nperpetually, this good lady never mentioned to strangers that he _was_\r\ndeceased. She thought, I suppose, that every able-bodied adult in\r\nEngland ought to know as much as that. In one of the gaps of silence,\r\nsomebody mentioned the dry and rather nasty subject of human anatomy;\r\nwhereupon good Mrs. Threadgall straightway brought in her late husband\r\nas usual, without mentioning that he was dead. Anatomy she described as\r\nthe Professor\xe2\x80\x99s favourite recreation in his leisure hours. As ill-luck\r\nwould have it, Mr. Candy, sitting opposite (who knew nothing of the\r\ndeceased gentleman), heard her. Being the most polite of men, he seized\r\nthe opportunity of assisting the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s anatomical amusements on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have got some remarkably fine skeletons lately at the College of\r\nSurgeons,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Candy, across the table, in a loud cheerful voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strongly recommend the Professor, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, when he next has an hour to\r\nspare, to pay them a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou might have heard a pin fall. The company (out of respect to the\r\nProfessor\xe2\x80\x99s memory) all sat speechless. I was behind Mrs. Threadgall at\r\nthe time, plying her confidentially with a glass of hock. She dropped\r\nher head, and said in a very low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMy beloved husband is no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnluckily Mr. Candy, hearing nothing, and miles away from suspecting\r\nthe truth, went on across the table louder and politer than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Professor may not be aware,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the card of a member\r\nof the College will admit him, on any day but Sunday, between the hours\r\nof ten and four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Threadgall dropped her head right into her tucker, and, in a lower\r\nvoice still, repeated the solemn words, \xe2\x80\x9cMy beloved husband is no\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI winked hard at Mr. Candy across the table. Miss Rachel touched his\r\narm. My lady looked unutterable things at him. Quite useless! On he\r\nwent, with a cordiality that there was no stopping anyhow. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\ndelighted,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cto send the Professor my card, if you will oblige\r\nme by mentioning his present address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis present address, sir, is _the grave_,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Threadgall,\r\nsuddenly losing her temper, and speaking with an emphasis and fury that\r\nmade the glasses ring again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Professor has been dead these ten\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good Heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Candy. Excepting the Bouncers, who burst\r\nout laughing, such a blank now fell on the company, that they might all\r\nhave been going the way of the Professor, and hailing as he did from\r\nthe direction of the grave.\r\n\r\nSo much for Mr. Candy. The rest of them were nearly as provoking in\r\ntheir different ways as the doctor himself. When they ought to have\r\nspoken, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak; or when they did speak they were perpetually\r\nat cross purposes. Mr. Godfrey, though so eloquent in public, declined\r\nto exert himself in private. Whether he was sulky, or whether he was\r\nbashful, after his discomfiture in the rose-garden, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. He\r\nkept all his talk for the private ear of the lady (a member of our\r\nfamily) who sat next to him. She was one of his committee-women\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nspiritually-minded person, with a fine show of collar-bone and a pretty\r\ntaste in champagne; liked it dry, you understand, and plenty of it.\r\nBeing close behind these two at the sideboard, I can testify, from what\r\nI heard pass between them, that the company lost a good deal of very\r\nimproving conversation, which I caught up while drawing the corks, and\r\ncarving the mutton, and so forth. What they said about their Charities\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. When I had time to listen to them, they had got a long\r\nway beyond their women to be confined, and their women to be rescued,\r\nand were disputing on serious subjects. Religion (I understand Mr.\r\nGodfrey to say, between the corks and the carving) meant love. And love\r\nmeant religion. And earth was heaven a little the worse for wear. And\r\nheaven was earth, done up again to look like new. Earth had some very\r\nobjectionable people in it; but, to make amends for that, all the women\r\nin heaven would be members of a prodigious committee that never\r\nquarrelled, with all the men in attendance on them as ministering\r\nangels. Beautiful! beautiful! But why the mischief did Mr. Godfrey keep\r\nit all to his lady and himself?\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin again\xe2\x80\x94surely, you will say, Mr. Franklin stirred the\r\ncompany up into making a pleasant evening of it?\r\n\r\nNothing of the sort! He had quite recovered himself, and he was in\r\nwonderful force and spirits, Penelope having informed him, I suspect,\r\nof Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s reception in the rose-garden. But, talk as he might,\r\nnine times out of ten he pitched on the wrong subject, or he addressed\r\nhimself to the wrong person; the end of it being that he offended some,\r\nand puzzled all of them. That foreign training of his\xe2\x80\x94those French and\r\nGerman and Italian sides of him, to which I have already alluded\xe2\x80\x94came\r\nout, at my lady\xe2\x80\x99s hospitable board, in a most bewildering manner.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, for instance, of his discussing the lengths to which\r\na married woman might let her admiration go for a man who was not her\r\nhusband, and putting it in his clear-headed witty French way to the\r\nmaiden aunt of the Vicar of Frizinghall? What do you think, when he\r\nshifted to the German side, of his telling the lord of the manor, while\r\nthat great authority on cattle was quoting his experience in the\r\nbreeding of bulls, that experience, properly understood counted for\r\nnothing, and that the proper way to breed bulls was to look deep into\r\nyour own mind, evolve out of it the idea of a perfect bull, and produce\r\nhim? What do you say, when our county member, growing hot, at cheese\r\nand salad time, about the spread of democracy in England, burst out as\r\nfollows: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we once lose our ancient safeguards, Mr. Blake, I beg to\r\nask you, what have we got left?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what do you say to Mr. Franklin\r\nanswering, from the Italian point of view: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got three things\r\nleft, sir\xe2\x80\x94Love, Music, and Salad\xe2\x80\x9d? He not only terrified the company\r\nwith such outbreaks as these, but, when the English side of him turned\r\nup in due course, he lost his foreign smoothness; and, getting on the\r\nsubject of the medical profession, said such downright things in\r\nridicule of doctors, that he actually put good-humoured little Mr.\r\nCandy in a rage.\r\n\r\nThe dispute between them began in Mr. Franklin being led\xe2\x80\x94I forget\r\nhow\xe2\x80\x94to acknowledge that he had latterly slept very badly at night. Mr.\r\nCandy thereupon told him that his nerves were all out of order and that\r\nhe ought to go through a course of medicine immediately. Mr. Franklin\r\nreplied that a course of medicine, and a course of groping in the dark,\r\nmeant, in his estimation, one and the same thing. Mr. Candy, hitting\r\nback smartly, said that Mr Franklin himself was, constitutionally\r\nspeaking, groping in the dark after sleep, and that nothing but\r\nmedicine could help him to find it. Mr. Franklin, keeping the ball up\r\non his side, said he had often heard of the blind leading the blind,\r\nand now, for the first time, he knew what it meant. In this way, they\r\nkept it going briskly, cut and thrust, till they both of them got\r\nhot\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Candy, in particular, so completely losing his self-control, in\r\ndefence of his profession, that my lady was obliged to interfere, and\r\nforbid the dispute to go on. This necessary act of authority put the\r\nlast extinguisher on the spirits of the company. The talk spurted up\r\nagain here and there, for a minute or two at a time; but there was a\r\nmiserable lack of life and sparkle in it. The Devil (or the Diamond)\r\npossessed that dinner-party; and it was a relief to everybody when my\r\nmistress rose, and gave the ladies the signal to leave the gentlemen\r\nover their wine.\r\n\r\nI had just ranged the decanters in a row before old Mr. Ablewhite (who\r\nrepresented the master of the house), when there came a sound from the\r\nterrace which, startled me out of my company manners on the instant.\r\nMr. Franklin and I looked at each other; it was the sound of the Indian\r\ndrum. As I live by bread, here were the jugglers returning to us with\r\nthe return of the Moonstone to the house!\r\n\r\nAs they rounded the corner of the terrace, and came in sight, I hobbled\r\nout to warn them off. But, as ill-luck would have it, the two Bouncers\r\nwere beforehand with me. They whizzed out on to the terrace like a\r\ncouple of skyrockets, wild to see the Indians exhibit their tricks. The\r\nother ladies followed; the gentlemen came out on their side. Before you\r\ncould say, \xe2\x80\x9cLord bless us!\xe2\x80\x9d the rogues were making their salaams; and\r\nthe Bouncers were kissing the pretty little boy.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin got on one side of Miss Rachel, and I put myself behind\r\nher. If our suspicions were right, there she stood, innocent of all\r\nknowledge of the truth, showing the Indians the Diamond in the bosom of\r\nher dress!\r\n\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what tricks they performed, or how they did it. What\r\nwith the vexation about the dinner, and what with the provocation of\r\nthe rogues coming back just in the nick of time to see the jewel with\r\ntheir own eyes, I own I lost my head. The first thing that I remember\r\nnoticing was the sudden appearance on the scene of the Indian\r\ntraveller, Mr. Murthwaite. Skirting the half-circle in which the\r\ngentlefolks stood or sat, he came quietly behind the jugglers and spoke\r\nto them on a sudden in the language of their own country.\r\n\r\nIf he had pricked them with a bayonet, I doubt if the Indians could\r\nhave started and turned on him with a more tigerish quickness than they\r\ndid, on hearing the first words that passed his lips. The next moment\r\nthey were bowing and salaaming to him in their most polite and snaky\r\nway. After a few words in the unknown tongue had passed on either side,\r\nMr. Murthwaite withdrew as quietly as he had approached. The chief\r\nIndian, who acted as interpreter, thereupon wheeled about again towards\r\nthe gentlefolks. I noticed that the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s coffee-coloured face had\r\nturned grey since Mr. Murthwaite had spoken to him. He bowed to my\r\nlady, and informed her that the exhibition was over. The Bouncers,\r\nindescribably disappointed, burst out with a loud \xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d directed against\r\nMr. Murthwaite for stopping the performance. The chief Indian laid his\r\nhand humbly on his breast, and said a second time that the juggling was\r\nover. The little boy went round with the hat. The ladies withdrew to\r\nthe drawing-room; and the gentlemen (excepting Mr. Franklin and Mr.\r\nMurthwaite) returned to their wine. I and the footman followed the\r\nIndians, and saw them safe off the premises.\r\n\r\nGoing back by way of the shrubbery, I smelt tobacco, and found Mr.\r\nFranklin and Mr. Murthwaite (the latter smoking a cheroot) walking\r\nslowly up and down among the trees. Mr. Franklin beckoned to me to join\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, presenting me to the great traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nGabriel Betteredge, the old servant and friend of our family of whom I\r\nspoke to you just now. Tell him, if you please, what you have just told\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Murthwaite took his cheroot out of his mouth, and leaned, in his\r\nweary way, against the trunk of a tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cthose three Indians are no more jugglers\r\nthan you and I are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was a new surprise! I naturally asked the traveller if he had ever\r\nmet with the Indians before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Murthwaite; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know what Indian juggling really\r\nis. All you have seen tonight is a very bad and clumsy imitation of it.\r\nUnless, after long experience, I am utterly mistaken, those men are\r\nhigh-caste Brahmins. I charged them with being disguised, and you saw\r\nhow it told on them, clever as the Hindoo people are in concealing\r\ntheir feelings. There is a mystery about their conduct that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexplain. They have doubly sacrificed their caste\xe2\x80\x94first, in crossing the\r\nsea; secondly, in disguising themselves as jugglers. In the land they\r\nlive in that is a tremendous sacrifice to make. There must be some very\r\nserious motive at the bottom of it, and some justification of no\r\nordinary kind to plead for them, in recovery of their caste, when they\r\nreturn to their own country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was struck dumb. Mr. Murthwaite went on with his cheroot. Mr.\r\nFranklin, after what looked to me like a little private veering about\r\nbetween the different sides of his character, broke the silence as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel some hesitation, Mr. Murthwaite, in troubling you with family\r\nmatters, in which you can have no interest and which I am not very\r\nwilling to speak of out of our own circle. But, after what you have\r\nsaid, I feel bound, in the interests of Lady Verinder and her daughter,\r\nto tell you something which may possibly put the clue into your hands.\r\nI speak to you in confidence; you will oblige me, I am sure, by not\r\nforgetting that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this preface, he told the Indian traveller all that he had told me\r\nat the Shivering Sand. Even the immovable Mr. Murthwaite was so\r\ninterested in what he heard, that he let his cheroot go out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, when he had done, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does your experience\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy experience,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the traveller, \xe2\x80\x9csays that you have had more\r\nnarrow escapes of your life, Mr. Franklin Blake, than I have had of\r\nmine; and that is saying a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be astonished now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really as serious as that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Murthwaite. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t doubt, after\r\nwhat you have told me, that the restoration of the Moonstone to its\r\nplace on the forehead of the Indian idol, is the motive and the\r\njustification of that sacrifice of caste which I alluded to just now.\r\nThose men will wait their opportunity with the patience of cats, and\r\nwill use it with the ferocity of tigers. How you have escaped them I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d says the eminent traveller, lighting his cheroot again,\r\nand staring hard at Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been carrying the Diamond\r\nbackwards and forwards, here and in London, and you are still a living\r\nman! Let us try and account for it. It was daylight, both times, I\r\nsuppose, when you took the jewel out of the bank in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroad daylight,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd plenty of people in the streets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou settled, of course, to arrive at Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house at a\r\ncertain time? It\xe2\x80\x99s a lonely country between this and the station. Did\r\nyou keep your appointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I arrived four hours earlier than my appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to congratulate you on that proceeding! When did you take the\r\nDiamond to the bank at the town here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took it an hour after I had brought it to this house\xe2\x80\x94and three hours\r\nbefore anybody was prepared for seeing me in these parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to congratulate you again! Did you bring it back here alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I happened to ride back with my cousins and the groom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to congratulate you for the third time! If you ever feel\r\ninclined to travel beyond the civilised limits, Mr. Blake, let me know,\r\nand I will go with you. You are a lucky man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I struck in. This sort of thing didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all square with my\r\nEnglish ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t really mean to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they would have\r\ntaken Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s life, to get their Diamond, if he had given them\r\nthe chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke, Mr. Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d says the traveller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you care much for the ashes left in your pipe when you empty it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the country those men came from, they care just as much about\r\nkilling a man, as you care about emptying the ashes out of your pipe.\r\nIf a thousand lives stood between them and the getting back of their\r\nDiamond\xe2\x80\x94and if they thought they could destroy those lives without\r\ndiscovery\xe2\x80\x94they would take them all. The sacrifice of caste is a serious\r\nthing in India, if you like. The sacrifice of life is nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expressed my opinion upon this, that they were a set of murdering\r\nthieves. Mr. Murthwaite expressed _his_ opinion that they were a\r\nwonderful people. Mr. Franklin, expressing no opinion at all, brought\r\nus back to the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have seen the Moonstone on Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s dress,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat your uncle threatened to do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Murthwaite. \xe2\x80\x9cColonel\r\nHerncastle understood the people he had to deal with. Send the Diamond\r\ntomorrow (under guard of more than one man) to be cut up at Amsterdam.\r\nMake half a dozen diamonds of it, instead of one. There is an end of\r\nits sacred identity as The Moonstone\xe2\x80\x94and there is an end of the\r\nconspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin turned to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no help for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must speak to Lady Verinder\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about tonight, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose the Indians come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Murthwaite answered me before Mr. Franklin could speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians won\xe2\x80\x99t risk coming back tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe direct way\r\nis hardly ever the way they take to anything\xe2\x80\x94let alone a matter like\r\nthis, in which the slightest mistake might be fatal to their reaching\r\ntheir end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose the rogues are bolder than you think, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Murthwaite, \xe2\x80\x9clet the dogs loose. Have you got\r\nany big dogs in the yard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo, sir. A mastiff and a bloodhound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will do. In the present emergency, Mr. Betteredge, the mastiff\r\nand the bloodhound have one great merit\xe2\x80\x94they are not likely to be\r\ntroubled with your scruples about the sanctity of human life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strumming of the piano reached us from the drawing-room, as he\r\nfired that shot at me. He threw away his cheroot, and took Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s arm, to go back to the ladies. I noticed that the sky was\r\nclouding over fast, as I followed them to the house. Mr. Murthwaite\r\nnoticed it too. He looked round at me, in his dry, droning way, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians will want their umbrellas, Mr. Betteredge, tonight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all very well for _him_ to joke. But I was not an eminent\r\ntraveller\xe2\x80\x94and my way in this world had not led me into playing ducks\r\nand drakes with my own life, among thieves and murderers in the\r\noutlandish places of the earth. I went into my own little room, and sat\r\ndown in my chair in a perspiration, and wondered helplessly what was to\r\nbe done next. In this anxious frame of mind, other men might have ended\r\nby working themselves up into a fever; _I_ ended in a different way. I\r\nlit my pipe, and took a turn at _Robinson Crusoe_.\r\n\r\nBefore I had been at it five minutes, I came to this amazing bit\xe2\x80\x94page\r\none hundred and sixty-one\xe2\x80\x94as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear of Danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than Danger\r\nitself, when apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety\r\ngreater, by much, than the Evil which we are anxious about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in _Robinson Crusoe_, after _that_, is a\r\nman with a screw loose in his understanding, or a man lost in the mist\r\nof his own self-conceit! Argument is thrown away upon him; and pity is\r\nbetter reserved for some person with a livelier faith.\r\n\r\nI was far on with my second pipe, and still lost in admiration of that\r\nwonderful book, when Penelope (who had been handing round the tea) came\r\nin with her report from the drawing-room. She had left the Bouncers\r\nsinging a duet\xe2\x80\x94words beginning with a large \xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x9d and music to\r\ncorrespond. She had observed that my lady made mistakes in her game of\r\nwhist for the first time in our experience of her. She had seen the\r\ngreat traveller asleep in a corner. She had overheard Mr. Franklin\r\nsharpening his wits on Mr. Godfrey, at the expense of Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Charities\r\nin general; and she had noticed that Mr. Godfrey hit him back again\r\nrather more smartly than became a gentleman of his benevolent\r\ncharacter. She had detected Miss Rachel, apparently engaged in\r\nappeasing Mrs. Threadgall by showing her some photographs, and really\r\noccupied in stealing looks at Mr. Franklin, which no intelligent lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid could misinterpret for a single instant. Finally, she had missed\r\nMr. Candy, the doctor, who had mysteriously disappeared from the\r\ndrawing-room, and had then mysteriously returned, and entered into\r\nconversation with Mr. Godfrey. Upon the whole, things were prospering\r\nbetter than the experience of the dinner gave us any right to expect.\r\nIf we could only hold on for another hour, old Father Time would bring\r\nup their carriages, and relieve us of them altogether.\r\n\r\nEverything wears off in this world; and even the comforting effect of\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_ wore off, after Penelope left me. I got fidgety\r\nagain, and resolved on making a survey of the grounds before the rain\r\ncame. Instead of taking the footman, whose nose was human, and\r\ntherefore useless in any emergency, I took the bloodhound with me.\r\n_His_ nose for a stranger was to be depended on. We went all round the\r\npremises, and out into the road\xe2\x80\x94and returned as wise as we went, having\r\ndiscovered no such thing as a lurking human creature anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the carriages was the signal for the arrival of the\r\nrain. It poured as if it meant to pour all night. With the exception of\r\nthe doctor, whose gig was waiting for him, the rest of the company went\r\nhome snugly, under cover, in close carriages. I told Mr. Candy that I\r\nwas afraid he would get wet through. He told me, in return, that he\r\nwondered I had arrived at my time of life, without knowing that a\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s skin was waterproof. So he drove away in the rain, laughing\r\nover his own little joke; and so we got rid of our dinner company.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to tell is the story of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWhen the last of the guests had driven away, I went back into the inner\r\nhall and found Samuel at the side-table, presiding over the brandy and\r\nsoda water. My lady and Miss Rachel came out of the drawing-room,\r\nfollowed by the two gentlemen. Mr. Godfrey had some brandy and soda\r\nwater, Mr. Franklin took nothing. He sat down, looking dead tired; the\r\ntalking on this birthday occasion had, I suppose, been too much for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMy lady, turning round to wish them good-night, looked hard at the\r\nwicked Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s legacy shining in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you going to put your Diamond tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Rachel was in high good spirits, just in that humour for talking\r\nnonsense, and perversely persisting in it as if it was sense, which you\r\nmay sometimes have observed in young girls, when they are highly\r\nwrought up, at the end of an exciting day. First, she declared she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to put the Diamond. Then she said, \xe2\x80\x9con her\r\ndressing-table, of course, along with her other things.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she\r\nremembered that the Diamond might take to shining of itself, with its\r\nawful moony light in the dark\xe2\x80\x94and that would terrify her in the dead of\r\nnight. Then she bethought herself of an Indian cabinet which stood in\r\nher sitting-room; and instantly made up her mind to put the Indian\r\ndiamond in the Indian cabinet, for the purpose of permitting two\r\nbeautiful native productions to admire each other. Having let her\r\nlittle flow of nonsense run on as far as that point, her mother\r\ninterposed and stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! your Indian cabinet has no lock to it,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Rachel, \xe2\x80\x9cis this an hotel? Are there\r\nthieves in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout taking notice of this fantastic way of talking, my lady wished\r\nthe gentlemen good-night. She next turned to Miss Rachel, and kissed\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not let _me_ keep the Diamond for you tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMiss Rachel received that proposal as she might, ten years since, have\r\nreceived a proposal to part her from a new doll. My lady saw there was\r\nno reasoning with her that night. \xe2\x80\x9cCome into my room, Rachel, the first\r\nthing tomorrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have something to say to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d With those last words she left us slowly; thinking her own\r\nthoughts, and, to all appearance, not best pleased with the way by\r\nwhich they were leading her.\r\n\r\nMiss Rachel was the next to say good-night. She shook hands first with\r\nMr. Godfrey, who was standing at the other end of the hall, looking at\r\na picture. Then she turned back to Mr. Franklin, still sitting weary\r\nand silent in a corner.\r\n\r\nWhat words passed between them I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. But standing near the old\r\noak frame which holds our large looking-glass, I saw her reflected in\r\nit, slyly slipping the locket which Mr. Franklin had given to her, out\r\nof the bosom of her dress, and showing it to him for a moment, with a\r\nsmile which certainly meant something out of the common, before she\r\ntripped off to bed. This incident staggered me a little in the reliance\r\nI had previously felt on my own judgment. I began to think that\r\nPenelope might be right about the state of her young lady\xe2\x80\x99s affections,\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Miss Rachel left him eyes to see with, Mr. Franklin noticed\r\nme. His variable humour, shifting about everything, had shifted about\r\nthe Indians already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m half inclined to think I took Mr.\r\nMurthwaite too seriously, when we had that talk in the shrubbery. I\r\nwonder whether he has been trying any of his traveller\xe2\x80\x99s tales on us?\r\nDo you really mean to let the dogs loose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll relieve them of their collars, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave them\r\nfree to take a turn in the night, if they smell a reason for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see what is to be done tomorrow.\r\nI am not at all disposed to alarm my aunt, Betteredge, without a very\r\npressing reason for it. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so worn and pale as he nodded to me, and took his candle to\r\ngo upstairs, that I ventured to advise his having a drop of\r\nbrandy-and-water, by way of night-cap. Mr. Godfrey, walking towards us\r\nfrom the other end of the hall, backed me. He pressed Mr. Franklin, in\r\nthe friendliest manner, to take something, before he went to bed.\r\n\r\nI only note these trifling circumstances, because, after all I had seen\r\nand heard, that day, it pleased me to observe that our two gentlemen\r\nwere on just as good terms as ever. Their warfare of words (heard by\r\nPenelope in the drawing-room), and their rivalry for the best place in\r\nMiss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s good graces, seemed to have set no serious difference\r\nbetween them. But there! they were both good-tempered, and both men of\r\nthe world. And there is certainly this merit in people of station, that\r\nthey are not nearly so quarrelsome among each other as people of no\r\nstation at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin declined the brandy-and-water, and went upstairs with Mr.\r\nGodfrey, their rooms being next door to each other. On the landing,\r\nhowever, either his cousin persuaded him, or he veered about and\r\nchanged his mind as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I may want it in the night,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncalled down to me. \xe2\x80\x9cSend up some brandy-and-water into my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sent up Samuel with the brandy-and-water; and then went out and\r\nunbuckled the dogs\xe2\x80\x99 collars. They both lost their heads with\r\nastonishment on being set loose at that time of night, and jumped upon\r\nme like a couple of puppies! However, the rain soon cooled them down\r\nagain: they lapped a drop of water each, and crept back into their\r\nkennels. As I went into the house, I noticed signs in the sky which\r\nbetokened a break in the weather for the better. For the present, it\r\nstill poured heavily, and the ground was in a perfect sop.\r\n\r\nSamuel and I went all over the house, and shut up as usual. I examined\r\neverything myself, and trusted nothing to my deputy on this occasion.\r\nAll was safe and fast when I rested my old bones in bed, between\r\nmidnight and one in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe worries of the day had been a little too much for me, I suppose. At\r\nany rate, I had a touch of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s malady that night. It was\r\nsunrise before I fell off at last into a sleep. All the time I lay\r\nawake the house was as quiet as the grave. Not a sound stirred but the\r\nsplash of the rain, and the sighing of the wind among the trees as a\r\nbreeze sprang up with the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout half-past seven I woke, and opened my window on a fine sunshiny\r\nday. The clock had struck eight, and I was just going out to chain up\r\nthe dogs again, when I heard a sudden whisking of petticoats on the\r\nstairs behind me.\r\n\r\nI turned about, and there was Penelope flying down after me like mad.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed, \xe2\x80\x9ccome upstairs, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! _The Diamond is\r\ngone!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you out of your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone!\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope. \xe2\x80\x9cGone, nobody knows how! Come up and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dragged me after her into our young lady\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, which\r\nopened into her bedroom. There, on the threshold of her bedroom door,\r\nstood Miss Rachel, almost as white in the face as the white\r\ndressing-gown that clothed her. There also stood the two doors of the\r\nIndian cabinet, wide open. One, of the drawers inside was pulled out as\r\nfar as it would go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope. \xe2\x80\x9cI myself saw Miss Rachel put the Diamond into\r\nthat drawer last night.\xe2\x80\x9d I went to the cabinet. The drawer was empty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this true, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nWith a look that was not like herself, with a voice that was not like\r\nher own, Miss Rachel answered as my daughter had answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Diamond is gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving said those words, she withdrew into her bedroom, and shut and\r\nlocked the door.\r\n\r\nBefore we knew which way to turn next, my lady came in, hearing my\r\nvoice in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, and wondering what had happened.\r\nThe news of the loss of the Diamond seemed to petrify her. She went\r\nstraight to Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and insisted on being admitted. Miss\r\nRachel let her in.\r\n\r\nThe alarm, running through the house like fire, caught the two\r\ngentlemen next.\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey was the first to come out of his room. All he did when he\r\nheard what had happened was to hold up his hands in a state of\r\nbewilderment, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much for his natural strength of mind.\r\nMr. Franklin, whose clear head I had confidently counted on to advise\r\nus, seemed to be as helpless as his cousin when he heard the news in\r\nhis turn. For a wonder, he had had a good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest at last; and the\r\nunaccustomed luxury of sleep had, as he said himself, apparently\r\nstupefied him. However, when he had swallowed his cup of coffee\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nhe always took, on the foreign plan, some hours before he ate any\r\nbreakfast\xe2\x80\x94his brains brightened; the clear-headed side of him turned\r\nup, and he took the matter in hand, resolutely and cleverly, much as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nHe first sent for the servants, and told them to leave all the lower\r\ndoors and windows (with the exception of the front door, which I had\r\nopened) exactly as they had been left when we locked up over night. He\r\nnext proposed to his cousin and to me to make quite sure, before we\r\ntook any further steps, that the Diamond had not accidentally dropped\r\nsomewhere out of sight\xe2\x80\x94say at the back of the cabinet, or down behind\r\nthe table on which the cabinet stood. Having searched in both places,\r\nand found nothing\xe2\x80\x94having also questioned Penelope, and discovered from\r\nher no more than the little she had already told me\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Franklin\r\nsuggested next extending our inquiries to Miss Rachel, and sent\r\nPenelope to knock at her bedroom door.\r\n\r\nMy lady answered the knock, and closed the door behind her. The moment\r\nafter we heard it locked inside by Miss Rachel. My mistress came out\r\namong us, looking sorely puzzled and distressed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe loss of the\r\nDiamond seems to have quite overwhelmed Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in reply to\r\nMr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe shrinks, in the strangest manner, from speaking of\r\nit, even to _me_. It is impossible you can see her for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving added to our perplexities by this account of Miss Rachel, my\r\nlady, after a little effort, recovered her usual composure, and acted\r\nwith her usual decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there is no help for it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\r\nhave no alternative but to send for the police?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the first thing for the police to do,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Franklin,\r\ncatching her up, \xe2\x80\x9cis to lay hands on the Indian jugglers who performed\r\nhere last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady and Mr. Godfrey (not knowing what Mr. Franklin and I knew) both\r\nstarted, and both looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stop to explain myself now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only\r\ntell you that the Indians have certainly stolen the Diamond. Give me a\r\nletter of introduction,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, addressing my lady, \xe2\x80\x9cto one of the\r\nmagistrates at Frizinghall\xe2\x80\x94merely telling him that I represent your\r\ninterests and wishes, and let me ride off with it instantly. Our chance\r\nof catching the thieves may depend on our not wasting one unnecessary\r\nminute.\xe2\x80\x9d (_Nota bene:_ Whether it was the French side or the English,\r\nthe right side of Mr. Franklin seemed to be uppermost now. The only\r\nquestion was, How long would it last?)\r\n\r\nHe put pen, ink, and paper before his aunt, who (as it appeared to me)\r\nwrote the letter he wanted a little unwillingly. If it had been\r\npossible to overlook such an event as the loss of a jewel worth twenty\r\nthousand pounds, I believe\xe2\x80\x94with my lady\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of her late brother,\r\nand her distrust of his birthday-gift\xe2\x80\x94it would have been privately a\r\nrelief to her to let the thieves get off with the Moonstone scot free.\r\n\r\nI went out with Mr. Franklin to the stables, and took the opportunity\r\nof asking him how the Indians (whom I suspected, of course, as shrewdly\r\nas he did) could possibly have got into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of them might have slipped into the hall, in the confusion, when\r\nthe dinner company were going away,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fellow may\r\nhave been under the sofa while my aunt and Rachel were talking about\r\nwhere the Diamond was to be put for the night. He would only have to\r\nwait till the house was quiet, and there it would be in the cabinet, to\r\nbe had for the taking.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, he called to the groom to\r\nopen the gate, and galloped off.\r\n\r\nThis seemed certainly to be the only rational explanation. But how had\r\nthe thief contrived to make his escape from the house? I had found the\r\nfront door locked and bolted, as I had left it at night, when I went to\r\nopen it, after getting up. As for the other doors and windows, there\r\nthey were still, all safe and fast, to speak for themselves. The dogs,\r\ntoo? Suppose the thief had got away by dropping from one of the upper\r\nwindows, how had he escaped the dogs? Had he come provided for them\r\nwith drugged meat? As the doubt crossed my mind, the dogs themselves\r\ncame galloping at me round a corner, rolling each other over on the wet\r\ngrass, in such lively health and spirits that it was with no small\r\ndifficulty I brought them to reason, and chained them up again. The\r\nmore I turned it over in my mind, the less satisfactory Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexplanation appeared to be.\r\n\r\nWe had our breakfasts\xe2\x80\x94whatever happens in a house, robbery or murder,\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, you must have your breakfast. When we had done, my\r\nlady sent for me; and I found myself compelled to tell her all that I\r\nhad hitherto concealed, relating to the Indians and their plot. Being a\r\nwoman of a high courage, she soon got over the first startling effect\r\nof what I had to communicate. Her mind seemed to be far more perturbed\r\nabout her daughter than about the heathen rogues and their conspiracy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how odd Rachel is, and how differently she behaves sometimes\r\nfrom other girls,\xe2\x80\x9d my lady said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have never, in all my\r\nexperience, seen her so strange and so reserved as she is now. The loss\r\nof her jewel seems almost to have turned her brain. Who would have\r\nthought that horrible Diamond could have laid such a hold on her in so\r\nshort a time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was certainly strange. Taking toys and trinkets in general, Miss\r\nRachel was nothing like so mad after them as most young girls. Yet\r\nthere she was, still locked up inconsolably in her bedroom. It is but\r\nfair to add that she was not the only one of us in the house who was\r\nthrown out of the regular groove. Mr. Godfrey, for instance\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nprofessionally a sort of consoler-general\xe2\x80\x94seemed to be at a loss where\r\nto look for his own resources. Having no company to amuse him, and\r\ngetting no chance of trying what his experience of women in distress\r\ncould do towards comforting Miss Rachel, he wandered hither and thither\r\nabout the house and gardens in an aimless uneasy way. He was in two\r\ndifferent minds about what it became him to do, after the misfortune\r\nthat had happened to us. Ought he to relieve the family, in their\r\npresent situation, of the responsibility of him as a guest, or ought he\r\nto stay on the chance that even his humble services might be of some\r\nuse? He decided ultimately that the last course was perhaps the most\r\ncustomary and considerate course to take, in such a very peculiar case\r\nof family distress as this was. Circumstances try the metal a man is\r\nreally made of. Mr. Godfrey, tried by circumstances, showed himself of\r\nweaker metal than I had thought him to be. As for the women-servants\r\nexcepting Rosanna Spearman, who kept by herself\xe2\x80\x94they took to whispering\r\ntogether in corners, and staring at nothing suspiciously, as is the\r\nmanner of that weaker half of the human family, when anything\r\nextraordinary happens in a house. I myself acknowledge to have been\r\nfidgety and ill-tempered. The cursed Moonstone had turned us all upside\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA little before eleven Mr. Franklin came back. The resolute side of him\r\nhad, to all appearance, given way, in the interval since his departure,\r\nunder the stress that had been laid on it. He had left us at a gallop;\r\nhe came back to us at a walk. When he went away, he was made of iron.\r\nWhen he returned, he was stuffed with cotton, as limp as limp could be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says my lady, \xe2\x80\x9care the police coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin; \xe2\x80\x9cthey said they would follow me in a fly.\r\nSuperintendent Seegrave, of your local police force, and two of his\r\nmen. A mere form! The case is hopeless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! have the Indians escaped, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor ill-used Indians have been most unjustly put in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nMr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are as innocent as the babe unborn. My idea that\r\none of them was hidden in the house has ended, like all the rest of my\r\nideas, in smoke. It\xe2\x80\x99s been proved,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, dwelling with\r\ngreat relish on his own incapacity, \xe2\x80\x9cto be simply impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter astonishing us by announcing this totally new turn in the matter\r\nof the Moonstone, our young gentleman, at his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s request, took a\r\nseat, and explained himself.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the resolute side of him had held out as far as\r\nFrizinghall. He had put the whole case plainly before the magistrate,\r\nand the magistrate had at once sent for the police. The first inquiries\r\ninstituted about the Indians showed that they had not so much as\r\nattempted to leave the town. Further questions addressed to the police,\r\nproved that all three had been seen returning to Frizinghall with their\r\nboy, on the previous night between ten and eleven\xe2\x80\x94which (regard being\r\nhad to hours and distances) also proved that they had walked straight\r\nback after performing on our terrace. Later still, at midnight, the\r\npolice, having occasion to search the common lodging-house where they\r\nlived, had seen them all three again, and their little boy with them,\r\nas usual. Soon after midnight I myself had safely shut up the house.\r\nPlainer evidence than this, in favour of the Indians, there could not\r\nwell be. The magistrate said there was not even a case of suspicion\r\nagainst them so far. But, as it was just possible, when the police came\r\nto investigate the matter, that discoveries affecting the jugglers\r\nmight be made, he would contrive, by committing them as rogues and\r\nvagabonds, to keep them at our disposal, under lock and key, for a\r\nweek. They had ignorantly done something (I forget what) in the town,\r\nwhich barely brought them within the operation of the law. Every human\r\ninstitution (justice included) will stretch a little, if you only pull\r\nit the right way. The worthy magistrate was an old friend of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand the Indians were \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted\xe2\x80\x9d for a week, as soon as the court\r\nopened that morning.\r\n\r\nSuch was Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s narrative of events at Frizinghall. The Indian\r\nclue to the mystery of the lost jewel was now, to all appearance, a\r\nclue that had broken in our hands. If the jugglers were innocent, who,\r\nin the name of wonder, had taken the Moonstone out of Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawer?\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, to our infinite relief; Superintendent Seegrave\r\narrived at the house. He reported passing Mr. Franklin on the terrace,\r\nsitting in the sun (I suppose with the Italian side of him uppermost),\r\nand warning the police, as they went by, that the investigation was\r\nhopeless, before the investigation had begun.\r\n\r\nFor a family in our situation, the Superintendent of the Frizinghall\r\npolice was the most comforting officer you could wish to see. Mr.\r\nSeegrave was tall and portly, and military in his manners. He had a\r\nfine commanding voice, and a mighty resolute eye, and a grand\r\nfrock-coat which buttoned beautifully up to his leather stock. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the\r\nman you want!\xe2\x80\x9d was written all over his face; and he ordered his two\r\ninferior police men about with a severity which convinced us all that\r\nthere was no trifling with _him_.\r\n\r\nHe began by going round the premises, outside and in; the result of\r\nthat investigation proving to him that no thieves had broken in upon us\r\nfrom outside, and that the robbery, consequently, must have been\r\ncommitted by some person in the house. I leave you to imagine the state\r\nthe servants were in when this official announcement first reached\r\ntheir ears. The Superintendent decided to begin by examining the\r\nboudoir, and, that done, to examine the servants next. At the same\r\ntime, he posted one of his men on the staircase which led to the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 bedrooms, with instructions to let nobody in the house pass\r\nhim, till further orders.\r\n\r\nAt this latter proceeding, the weaker half of the human family went\r\ndistracted on the spot. They bounced out of their corners, whisked\r\nupstairs in a body to Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s room (Rosanna Spearman being\r\ncarried away among them this time), burst in on Superintendent\r\nSeegrave, and, all looking equally guilty, summoned him to say which of\r\nthem he suspected, at once.\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent proved equal to the occasion; he looked at them with\r\nhis resolute eye, and he cowed them with his military voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, you women, go downstairs again, everyone of you; I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave you here. Look!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Superintendent, suddenly pointing to a\r\nlittle smear of the decorative painting on Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s door, at the\r\nouter edge, just under the lock. \xe2\x80\x9cLook what mischief the petticoats of\r\nsome of you have done already. Clear out! clear out!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosanna Spearman,\r\nwho was nearest to him, and nearest to the little smear on the door,\r\nset the example of obedience, and slipped off instantly to her work.\r\nThe rest followed her out. The Superintendent finished his examination\r\nof the room, and, making nothing of it, asked me who had first\r\ndiscovered the robbery. My daughter had first discovered it. My\r\ndaughter was sent for.\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent proved to be a little too sharp with Penelope at\r\nstarting. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, young woman, attend to me, and mind you speak the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d Penelope fired up instantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been taught to tell\r\nlies Mr. Policeman!\xe2\x80\x94and if father can stand there and hear me accused\r\nof falsehood and thieving, and my own bedroom shut against me, and my\r\ncharacter taken away, which is all a poor girl has left, he\xe2\x80\x99s not the\r\ngood father I take him for!\xe2\x80\x9d A timely word from me put Justice and\r\nPenelope on a pleasanter footing together. The questions and answers\r\nwent swimmingly, and ended in nothing worth mentioning. My daughter had\r\nseen Miss Rachel put the Diamond in the drawer of the cabinet the last\r\nthing at night. She had gone in with Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s cup of tea at eight\r\nthe next morning, and had found the drawer open and empty. Upon that,\r\nshe had alarmed the house\xe2\x80\x94and there was an end of Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent next asked to see Miss Rachel herself. Penelope\r\nmentioned his request through the door. The answer reached us by the\r\nsame road: \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to tell the policeman\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t see anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOur experienced officer looked equally surprised and offended when he\r\nheard that reply. I told him my young lady was ill, and begged him to\r\nwait a little and see her later. We thereupon went downstairs again,\r\nand were met by Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Franklin crossing the hall.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen, being inmates of the house, were summoned to say if\r\nthey could throw any light on the matter. Neither of them knew anything\r\nabout it. Had they heard any suspicious noises during the previous\r\nnight? They had heard nothing but the pattering of the rain. Had I,\r\nlying awake longer than either of them, heard nothing either? Nothing!\r\nReleased from examination, Mr. Franklin, still sticking to the helpless\r\nview of our difficulty, whispered to me: \xe2\x80\x9cThat man will be of no\r\nearthly use to us. Superintendent Seegrave is an ass.\xe2\x80\x9d Released in his\r\nturn, Mr. Godfrey whispered to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently a most competent person.\r\nBetteredge, I have the greatest faith in him!\xe2\x80\x9d Many men, many opinions,\r\nas one of the ancients said, before my time.\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s next proceeding took him back to the \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nagain, with my daughter and me at his heels. His object was to discover\r\nwhether any of the furniture had been moved, during the night, out of\r\nits customary place\xe2\x80\x94his previous investigation in the room having,\r\napparently, not gone quite far enough to satisfy his mind on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still poking about among the chairs and tables, the door\r\nof the bedroom was suddenly opened. After having denied herself to\r\neverybody, Miss Rachel, to our astonishment, walked into the midst of\r\nus of her own accord. She took up her garden hat from a chair, and then\r\nwent straight to Penelope with this question:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin Blake sent you with a message to me this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wished to speak to me, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing voices on the terrace below, I looked out of window, and saw\r\nthe two gentlemen walking up and down together. Answering for my\r\ndaughter, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin is on the terrace, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word, without heeding Mr. Superintendent, who tried to\r\nspeak to her, pale as death, and wrapped up strangely in her own\r\nthoughts, she left the room, and went down to her cousins on the\r\nterrace.\r\n\r\nIt showed a want of due respect, it showed a breach of good manners, on\r\nmy part, but, for the life of me, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help looking out of window\r\nwhen Miss Rachel met the gentlemen outside. She went up to Mr. Franklin\r\nwithout appearing to notice Mr. Godfrey, who thereupon drew back and\r\nleft them by themselves. What she said to Mr. Franklin appeared to be\r\nspoken vehemently. It lasted but for a short time, and, judging by what\r\nI saw of his face from the window, seemed to astonish him beyond all\r\npower of expression. While they were still together, my lady appeared\r\non the terrace. Miss Rachel saw her\xe2\x80\x94said a few last words to Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly went back into the house again, before her mother\r\ncame up with her. My lady surprised herself, and noticing Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, spoke to him. Mr. Godfrey joined them, and spoke\r\nalso. Mr. Franklin walked away a little between the two, telling them\r\nwhat had happened I suppose, for they both stopped short, after taking\r\na few steps, like persons struck with amazement. I had just seen as\r\nmuch as this, when the door of the sitting-room was opened violently.\r\nMiss Rachel walked swiftly through to her bedroom, wild and angry, with\r\nfierce eyes and flaming cheeks. Mr. Superintendent once more attempted\r\nto question her. She turned round on him at her bedroom door. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ have\r\nnot sent for you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t want you. My\r\nDiamond is lost. Neither you nor anybody else will ever find it!\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthose words she went in, and locked the door in our faces. Penelope,\r\nstanding nearest to it, heard her burst out crying the moment she was\r\nalone again.\r\n\r\nIn a rage, one moment; in tears, the next! What did it mean?\r\n\r\nI told the Superintendent it meant that Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s temper was upset\r\nby the loss of her jewel. Being anxious for the honour of the family,\r\nit distressed me to see my young lady forget herself\xe2\x80\x94even with a\r\npolice-officer\xe2\x80\x94and I made the best excuse I could, accordingly. In my\r\nown private mind I was more puzzled by Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary\r\nlanguage and conduct than words can tell. Taking what she had said at\r\nher bedroom door as a guide to guess by, I could only conclude that she\r\nwas mortally offended by our sending for the police, and that Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment on the terrace was caused by her having\r\nexpressed herself to him (as the person chiefly instrumental in\r\nfetching the police) to that effect. If this guess was right,\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94having lost her Diamond\xe2\x80\x94should she object to the presence in the\r\nhouse of the very people whose business it was to recover it for her?\r\nAnd how, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, could _she_ know that the Moonstone would\r\nnever be found again?\r\n\r\nAs things stood, at present, no answer to those questions was to be\r\nhoped for from anybody in the house. Mr. Franklin appeared to think it\r\na point of honour to forbear repeating to a servant\xe2\x80\x94even to so old a\r\nservant as I was\xe2\x80\x94what Miss Rachel had said to him on the terrace. Mr.\r\nGodfrey, who, as a gentleman and a relative, had been probably admitted\r\ninto Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, respected that confidence as he was\r\nbound to do. My lady, who was also in the secret no doubt, and who\r\nalone had access to Miss Rachel, owned openly that she could make\r\nnothing of her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou madden me when you talk of the Diamond!\xe2\x80\x9d All her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s influence failed to extract from her a word more than that.\r\n\r\nHere we were, then, at a dead-lock about Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x94and at a dead-lock\r\nabout the Moonstone. In the first case, my lady was powerless to help\r\nus. In the second (as you shall presently judge), Mr. Seegrave was fast\r\napproaching the condition of a superintendent at his wits\xe2\x80\x99 end.\r\n\r\nHaving ferreted about all over the \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir,\xe2\x80\x9d without making any\r\ndiscoveries among the furniture, our experienced officer applied to me\r\nto know, whether the servants in general were or were not acquainted\r\nwith the place in which the Diamond had been put for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew where it was put, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cto begin with. Samuel, the\r\nfootman, knew also\xe2\x80\x94for he was present in the hall, when they were\r\ntalking about where the Diamond was to be kept that night. My daughter\r\nknew, as she has already told you. She or Samuel may have mentioned the\r\nthing to the other servants\xe2\x80\x94or the other servants may have heard the\r\ntalk for themselves, through the side-door of the hall, which might\r\nhave been open to the back staircase. For all I can tell, everybody in\r\nthe house may have known where the jewel was, last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy answer presenting rather a wide field for Mr. Superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions to range over, he tried to narrow it by asking about the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 characters next.\r\n\r\nI thought directly of Rosanna Spearman. But it was neither my place nor\r\nmy wish to direct suspicion against a poor girl, whose honesty had been\r\nabove all doubt as long as I had known her. The matron at the\r\nReformatory had reported her to my lady as a sincerely penitent and\r\nthoroughly trustworthy girl. It was the Superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s business to\r\ndiscover reason for suspecting her first\xe2\x80\x94and then, and not till then,\r\nit would be my duty to tell him how she came into my lady\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll our people have excellent characters,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all have\r\ndeserved the trust their mistress has placed in them.\xe2\x80\x9d After that,\r\nthere was but one thing left for Mr. Seegrave to do\xe2\x80\x94namely, to set to\r\nwork, and tackle the servants\xe2\x80\x99 characters himself.\r\n\r\nOne after another, they were examined. One after another, they proved\r\nto have nothing to say\xe2\x80\x94and said it (so far as the women were concerned)\r\nat great length, and with a very angry sense of the embargo laid on\r\ntheir bedrooms. The rest of them being sent back to their places\r\ndownstairs, Penelope was then summoned, and examined separately a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nMy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s little outbreak of temper in the \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir,\xe2\x80\x9d and her\r\nreadiness to think herself suspected, appeared to have produced an\r\nunfavourable impression on Superintendent Seegrave. It seemed also to\r\ndwell a little on his mind, that she had been the last person who saw\r\nthe Diamond at night. When the second questioning was over, my girl\r\ncame back to me in a frenzy. There was no doubt of it any longer\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npolice-officer had almost as good as told her she was the thief! I\r\ncould scarcely believe him (taking Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s view) to be quite\r\nsuch an ass as that. But, though he said nothing, the eye with which he\r\nlooked at my daughter was not a very pleasant eye to see. I laughed it\r\noff with poor Penelope, as something too ridiculous to be treated\r\nseriously\xe2\x80\x94which it certainly was. Secretly, I am afraid I was foolish\r\nenough to be angry too. It was a little trying\xe2\x80\x94it was, indeed. My girl\r\nsat down in a corner, with her apron over her head, quite\r\nbroken-hearted. Foolish of her, you will say. She might have waited\r\ntill he openly accused her. Well, being a man of just an equal temper,\r\nI admit that. Still Mr. Superintendent might have remembered\xe2\x80\x94never mind\r\nwhat he might have remembered. The devil take him!\r\n\r\nThe next and last step in the investigation brought matters, as they\r\nsay, to a crisis. The officer had an interview (at which I was present)\r\nwith my lady. After informing her that the Diamond _must_ have been\r\ntaken by somebody in the house, he requested permission for himself and\r\nhis men to search the servants\xe2\x80\x99 rooms and boxes on the spot. My good\r\nmistress, like the generous high-bred woman she was, refused to let us\r\nbe treated like thieves. \xe2\x80\x9cI will never consent to make such a return as\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all I owe to the faithful servants who are\r\nemployed in my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent made his bow, with a look in my direction, which\r\nsaid plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy employ me, if you are to tie my hands in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs head of the servants, I felt directly that we were bound, in justice\r\nto all parties, not to profit by our mistress\xe2\x80\x99s generosity. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\ngratefully thank your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we ask your permission to\r\ndo what is right in this matter by giving up our keys. When Gabriel\r\nBetteredge sets the example,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, stopping Superintendent Seegrave\r\nat the door, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rest of the servants will follow, I promise you.\r\nThere are my keys, to begin with!\xe2\x80\x9d My lady took me by the hand, and\r\nthanked me with the tears in her eyes. Lord! what would I not have\r\ngiven, at that moment, for the privilege of knocking Superintendent\r\nSeegrave down!\r\n\r\nAs I had promised for them, the other servants followed my lead, sorely\r\nagainst the grain, of course, but all taking the view that I took. The\r\nwomen were a sight to see, while the police-officers were rummaging\r\namong their things. The cook looked as if she could grill Mr.\r\nSuperintendent alive on a furnace, and the other women looked as if\r\nthey could eat him when he was done.\r\n\r\nThe search over, and no Diamond or sign of a Diamond being found, of\r\ncourse, anywhere, Superintendent Seegrave retired to my little room to\r\nconsider with himself what he was to do next. He and his men had now\r\nbeen hours in the house, and had not advanced us one inch towards a\r\ndiscovery of how the Moonstone had been taken, or of whom we were to\r\nsuspect as the thief.\r\n\r\nWhile the police-officer was still pondering in solitude, I was sent\r\nfor to see Mr. Franklin in the library. To my unutterable astonishment,\r\njust as my hand was on the door, it was suddenly opened from the\r\ninside, and out walked Rosanna Spearman!\r\n\r\nAfter the library had been swept and cleaned in the morning, neither\r\nfirst nor second housemaid had any business in that room at any later\r\nperiod of the day. I stopped Rosanna Spearman, and charged her with a\r\nbreach of domestic discipline on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat might you want in the library at this time of day?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin Blake dropped one of his rings upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d says Rosanna;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I have been into the library to give it to him.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwas all in a flush as she made me that answer; and she walked away with\r\na toss of her head and a look of self-importance which I was quite at a\r\nloss to account for. The proceedings in the house had doubtless upset\r\nall the women-servants more or less; but none of them had gone clean\r\nout of their natural characters, as Rosanna, to all appearance, had now\r\ngone out of hers.\r\n\r\nI found Mr. Franklin writing at the library-table. He asked for a\r\nconveyance to the railway station the moment I entered the room. The\r\nfirst sound of his voice informed me that we now had the resolute side\r\nof him uppermost once more. The man made of cotton had disappeared; and\r\nthe man made of iron sat before me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to London, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to telegraph to London,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cI have convinced my\r\naunt that we must have a cleverer head than Superintendent Seegrave\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto help us; and I have got her permission to despatch a telegram to my\r\nfather. He knows the Chief Commissioner of Police, and the Commissioner\r\ncan lay his hand on the right man to solve the mystery of the Diamond.\r\nTalking of mysteries, by-the-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, dropping his\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cI have another word to say to you before you go to the stables.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t breathe a word of it to anybody as yet; but either Rosanna\r\nSpearman\xe2\x80\x99s head is not quite right, or I am afraid she knows more about\r\nthe Moonstone than she ought to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can hardly tell whether I was more startled or distressed at hearing\r\nhim say that. If I had been younger, I might have confessed as much to\r\nMr. Franklin. But when you are old, you acquire one excellent habit. In\r\ncases where you don\xe2\x80\x99t see your way clearly, you hold your tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came in here with a ring I dropped in my bedroom,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had thanked her, of course I expected her to go.\r\nInstead of that, she stood opposite to me at the table, looking at me\r\nin the oddest manner\xe2\x80\x94half frightened, and half familiar\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nit out. \xe2\x80\x98This is a strange thing about the Diamond, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, in\r\na curiously sudden, headlong way. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, it was,\xe2\x80\x99 and wondered\r\nwhat was coming next. Upon my honour, Betteredge, I think she must be\r\nwrong in the head! She said, \xe2\x80\x98They will never find the Diamond, sir,\r\nwill they? No! nor the person who took it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for that.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nactually nodded and smiled at me! Before I could ask her what she\r\nmeant, we heard your step outside. I suppose she was afraid of your\r\ncatching her here. At any rate, she changed colour, and left the room.\r\nWhat on earth does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not bring myself to tell him the girl\xe2\x80\x99s story, even then. It\r\nwould have been almost as good as telling him that she was the thief.\r\nBesides, even if I had made a clean breast of it, and even supposing\r\nshe was the thief, the reason why she should let out her secret to Mr.\r\nFranklin, of all the people in the world, would have been still as far\r\nto seek as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the idea of getting the poor girl into a scrape, merely\r\nbecause she has a flighty way with her, and talks very strangely,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nFranklin went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet if she had said to the Superintendent what\r\nshe said to me, fool as he is, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped there, and left\r\nthe rest unspoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best way, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill be for me to say two words privately\r\nto my mistress about it at the first opportunity. My lady has a very\r\nfriendly interest in Rosanna; and the girl may only have been forward\r\nand foolish, after all. When there\xe2\x80\x99s a mess of any kind in a house,\r\nsir, the women-servants like to look at the gloomy side\xe2\x80\x94it gives the\r\npoor wretches a kind of importance in their own eyes. If there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanybody ill, trust the women for prophesying that the person will die.\r\nIf it\xe2\x80\x99s a jewel lost, trust them for prophesying that it will never be\r\nfound again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis view (which I am bound to say, I thought a probable view myself,\r\non reflection) seemed to relieve Mr. Franklin mightily: he folded up\r\nhis telegram, and dismissed the subject. On my way to the stables, to\r\norder the pony-chaise, I looked in at the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, where they\r\nwere at dinner. Rosanna Spearman was not among them. On inquiry, I\r\nfound that she had been suddenly taken ill, and had gone upstairs to\r\nher own room to lie down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious! She looked well enough when I saw her last,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\nPenelope followed me out. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk in that way before the rest of\r\nthem, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou only make them harder on Rosanna than\r\never. The poor thing is breaking her heart about Mr. Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was another view of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. If it was possible for\r\nPenelope to be right, the explanation of Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s strange language and\r\nbehaviour might have been all in this\xe2\x80\x94that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care what she\r\nsaid, so long as she could surprise Mr. Franklin into speaking to her.\r\nGranting that to be the right reading of the riddle, it accounted,\r\nperhaps, for her flighty, self-conceited manner when she passed me in\r\nthe hall. Though he had only said three words, still she had carried\r\nher point, and Mr. Franklin _had_ spoken to her.\r\n\r\nI saw the pony harnessed myself. In the infernal network of mysteries\r\nand uncertainties that now surrounded us, I declare it was a relief to\r\nobserve how well the buckles and straps understood each other! When you\r\nhad seen the pony backed into the shafts of the chaise, you had seen\r\nsomething there was no doubt about. And that, let me tell you, was\r\nbecoming a treat of the rarest kind in our household.\r\n\r\nGoing round with the chaise to the front door, I found not only Mr.\r\nFranklin, but Mr. Godfrey and Superintendent Seegrave also waiting for\r\nme on the steps.\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s reflections (after failing to find the Diamond in\r\nthe servants\xe2\x80\x99 rooms or boxes) had led him, it appeared, to an entirely\r\nnew conclusion. Still sticking to his first text, namely, that somebody\r\nin the house had stolen the jewel, our experienced officer was now of\r\nthe opinion that the thief (he was wise enough not to name poor\r\nPenelope, whatever he might privately think of her!) had been acting in\r\nconcert with the Indians; and he accordingly proposed shifting his\r\ninquiries to the jugglers in the prison at Frizinghall. Hearing of this\r\nnew move, Mr. Franklin had volunteered to take the Superintendent back\r\nto the town, from which he could telegraph to London as easily as from\r\nour station. Mr. Godfrey, still devoutly believing in Mr. Seegrave, and\r\ngreatly interested in witnessing the examination of the Indians, had\r\nbegged leave to accompany the officer to Frizinghall. One of the two\r\ninferior policemen was to be left at the house, in case anything\r\nhappened. The other was to go back with the Superintendent to the town.\r\nSo the four places in the pony-chaise were just filled.\r\n\r\nBefore he took the reins to drive off, Mr. Franklin walked me away a\r\nfew steps out of hearing of the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait to telegraph to London,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I see what comes\r\nof our examination of the Indians. My own conviction is, that this\r\nmuddle-headed local police-officer is as much in the dark as ever, and\r\nis simply trying to gain time. The idea of any of the servants being in\r\nleague with the Indians is a preposterous absurdity, in my opinion.\r\nKeep about the house, Betteredge, till I come back, and try what you\r\ncan make of Rosanna Spearman. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to do anything degrading\r\nto your own self-respect, or anything cruel towards the girl. I only\r\nask you to exercise your observation more carefully than usual. We will\r\nmake as light of it as we can before my aunt\xe2\x80\x94but this is a more\r\nimportant matter than you may suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a matter of twenty thousand pounds, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, thinking of\r\nthe value of the Diamond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of quieting Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Franklin\r\ngravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very uneasy about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left me suddenly; as if he desired to cut short any further talk\r\nbetween us. I thought I understood why. Further talk might have let me\r\ninto the secret of what Miss Rachel had said to him on the terrace.\r\n\r\nSo they drove away to Frizinghall. I was ready enough, in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown interest, to have a little talk with Rosanna in private. But the\r\nneedful opportunity failed to present itself. She only came downstairs\r\nagain at tea-time. When she did appear, she was flighty and excited,\r\nhad what they call an hysterical attack, took a dose of sal-volatile by\r\nmy lady\xe2\x80\x99s order, and was sent back to her bed.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on to its end drearily and miserably enough, I can tell\r\nyou. Miss Rachel still kept her room, declaring that she was too ill to\r\ncome down to dinner that day. My lady was in such low spirits about her\r\ndaughter, that I could not bring myself to make her additionally\r\nanxious, by reporting what Rosanna Spearman had said to Mr. Franklin.\r\nPenelope persisted in believing that she was to be forthwith tried,\r\nsentenced, and transported for theft. The other women took to their\r\nBibles and hymn-books, and looked as sour as verjuice over their\r\nreading\xe2\x80\x94a result, which I have observed, in my sphere of life, to\r\nfollow generally on the performance of acts of piety at unaccustomed\r\nperiods of the day. As for me, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even heart enough to open my\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_. I went out into the yard, and, being hard up for a\r\nlittle cheerful society, set my chair by the kennels, and talked to the\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour before dinner-time, the two gentlemen came back from\r\nFrizinghall, having arranged with Superintendent Seegrave that he was\r\nto return to us the next day. They had called on Mr. Murthwaite, the\r\nIndian traveller, at his present residence, near the town. At Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s request, he had kindly given them the benefit of his\r\nknowledge of the language, in dealing with those two, out of the three\r\nIndians, who knew nothing of English. The examination, conducted\r\ncarefully, and at great length, had ended in nothing; not the shadow of\r\na reason being discovered for suspecting the jugglers of having\r\ntampered with any of our servants. On reaching that conclusion, Mr.\r\nFranklin had sent his telegraphic message to London, and there the\r\nmatter now rested till tomorrow came.\r\n\r\nSo much for the history of the day that followed the birthday. Not a\r\nglimmer of light had broken in on us, so far. A day or two after,\r\nhowever, the darkness lifted a little. How, and with what result, you\r\nshall presently see.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Thursday night passed, and nothing happened. With the Friday\r\nmorning came two pieces of news.\r\n\r\nItem the first: the baker\xe2\x80\x99s man declared he had met Rosanna Spearman,\r\non the previous afternoon, with a thick veil on, walking towards\r\nFrizinghall by the foot-path way over the moor. It seemed strange that\r\nanybody should be mistaken about Rosanna, whose shoulder marked her out\r\npretty plainly, poor thing\xe2\x80\x94but mistaken the man must have been; for\r\nRosanna, as you know, had been all the Thursday afternoon ill upstairs\r\nin her room.\r\n\r\nItem the second came through the postman. Worthy Mr. Candy had said one\r\nmore of his many unlucky things, when he drove off in the rain on the\r\nbirthday night, and told me that a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s skin was waterproof. In\r\nspite of his skin, the wet had got through him. He had caught a chill\r\nthat night, and was now down with a fever. The last accounts, brought\r\nby the postman, represented him to be light-headed\xe2\x80\x94talking nonsense as\r\nglibly, poor man, in his delirium as he often talked it in his sober\r\nsenses. We were all sorry for the little doctor; but Mr. Franklin\r\nappeared to regret his illness, chiefly on Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s account. From\r\nwhat he said to my lady, while I was in the room at breakfast-time, he\r\nappeared to think that Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x94if the suspense about the Moonstone\r\nwas not soon set at rest\xe2\x80\x94might stand in urgent need of the best medical\r\nadvice at our disposal.\r\n\r\nBreakfast had not been over long, when a telegram from Mr. Blake, the\r\nelder, arrived, in answer to his son. It informed us that he had laid\r\nhands (by help of his friend, the Commissioner) on the right man to\r\nhelp us. The name of him was Sergeant Cuff; and the arrival of him from\r\nLondon might be expected by the morning train.\r\n\r\nAt reading the name of the new police-officer, Mr. Franklin gave a\r\nstart. It seems that he had heard some curious anecdotes about Sergeant\r\nCuff, from his father\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, during his stay in London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to hope we are seeing the end of our anxieties already,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cIf half the stories I have heard are true, when it comes to\r\nunravelling a mystery, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t the equal in England of Sergeant\r\nCuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all got excited and impatient as the time drew near for the\r\nappearance of this renowned and capable character. Superintendent\r\nSeegrave, returning to us at his appointed time, and hearing that the\r\nSergeant was expected, instantly shut himself up in a room, with pen,\r\nink, and paper, to make notes of the Report which would be certainly\r\nexpected from him. I should have liked to have gone to the station\r\nmyself, to fetch the Sergeant. But my lady\xe2\x80\x99s carriage and horses were\r\nnot to be thought of, even for the celebrated Cuff; and the pony-chaise\r\nwas required later for Mr. Godfrey. He deeply regretted being obliged\r\nto leave his aunt at such an anxious time; and he kindly put off the\r\nhour of his departure till as late as the last train, for the purpose\r\nof hearing what the clever London police-officer thought of the case.\r\nBut on Friday night he must be in town, having a Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Charity, in\r\ndifficulties, waiting to consult him on Saturday morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, I went down to the gate\r\nto look out for him.\r\n\r\nA fly from the railway drove up as I reached the lodge; and out got a\r\ngrizzled, elderly man, so miserably lean that he looked as if he had\r\nnot got an ounce of flesh on his bones in any part of him. He was\r\ndressed all in decent black, with a white cravat round his neck. His\r\nface was as sharp as a hatchet, and the skin of it was as yellow and\r\ndry and withered as an autumn leaf. His eyes, of a steely light grey,\r\nhad a very disconcerting trick, when they encountered your eyes, of\r\nlooking as if they expected something more from you than you were aware\r\nof yourself. His walk was soft; his voice was melancholy; his long\r\nlanky fingers were hooked like claws. He might have been a parson, or\r\nan undertaker\xe2\x80\x94or anything else you like, except what he really was. A\r\nmore complete opposite to Superintendent Seegrave than Sergeant Cuff,\r\nand a less comforting officer to look at, for a family in distress, I\r\ndefy you to discover, search where you may.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Sergeant Cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, sir, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn our road to the house, I mentioned my name and position in the\r\nfamily, to satisfy him that he might speak to me about the business on\r\nwhich my lady was to employ him. Not a word did he say about the\r\nbusiness, however, for all that. He admired the grounds, and remarked\r\nthat he felt the sea air very brisk and refreshing. I privately\r\nwondered, on my side, how the celebrated Cuff had got his reputation.\r\nWe reached the house, in the temper of two strange dogs, coupled up\r\ntogether for the first time in their lives by the same chain.\r\n\r\nAsking for my lady, and hearing that she was in one of the\r\nconservatories, we went round to the gardens at the back, and sent a\r\nservant to seek her. While we were waiting, Sergeant Cuff looked\r\nthrough the evergreen arch on our left, spied out our rosery, and\r\nwalked straight in, with the first appearance of anything like interest\r\nthat he had shown yet. To the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment, and to my\r\ndisgust, this celebrated policeman proved to be quite a mine of\r\nlearning on the trumpery subject of rose-gardens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the right exposure here to the south and sou\xe2\x80\x99-west,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays the Sergeant, with a wag of his grizzled head, and a streak of\r\npleasure in his melancholy voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the shape for a\r\nrosery\xe2\x80\x94nothing like a circle set in a square. Yes, yes; with walks\r\nbetween all the beds. But they oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be gravel walks like these.\r\nGrass, Mr. Gardener\xe2\x80\x94grass walks between your roses; gravel\xe2\x80\x99s too hard\r\nfor them. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sweet pretty bed of white roses and blush roses.\r\nThey always mix well together, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? Here\xe2\x80\x99s the white musk rose,\r\nMr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94our old English rose holding up its head along with the\r\nbest and the newest of them. Pretty dear!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, fondling\r\nthe Musk Rose with his lanky fingers, and speaking to it as if he was\r\nspeaking to a child.\r\n\r\nThis was a nice sort of man to recover Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s Diamond, and to\r\nfind out the thief who stole it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to be fond of roses, Sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t much time to be fond of anything,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nwhen I _have_ a moment\xe2\x80\x99s fondness to bestow, most times, Mr.\r\nBetteredge, the roses get it. I began my life among them in my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnursery garden, and I shall end my life among them, if I can. Yes. One\r\nof these days (please God) I shall retire from catching thieves, and\r\ntry my hand at growing roses. There will be grass walks, Mr. Gardener,\r\nbetween my beds,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, on whose mind the gravel paths of\r\nour rosery seemed to dwell unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems an odd taste, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to say, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a man in your\r\nline of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will look about you (which most people won\xe2\x80\x99t do),\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nSergeant Cuff, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will see that the nature of a man\xe2\x80\x99s tastes is, most\r\ntimes, as opposite as possible to the nature of a man\xe2\x80\x99s business. Show\r\nme any two things more opposite one from the other than a rose and a\r\nthief; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll correct my tastes accordingly\xe2\x80\x94if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too late at\r\nmy time of life. You find the damask rose a goodish stock for most of\r\nthe tender sorts, don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr. Gardener? Ah! I thought so. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlady coming. Is it Lady Verinder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had seen her before either I or the gardener had seen her, though we\r\nknew which way to look, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I began to think him rather a\r\nquicker man than he appeared to be at first sight.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s appearance, or the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s errand\xe2\x80\x94one or both\xe2\x80\x94seemed\r\nto cause my lady some little embarrassment. She was, for the first time\r\nin all my experience of her, at a loss what to say at an interview with\r\na stranger. Sergeant Cuff put her at her ease directly. He asked if any\r\nother person had been employed about the robbery before we sent for\r\nhim; and hearing that another person had been called in, and was now in\r\nthe house, begged leave to speak to him before anything else was done.\r\n\r\nMy lady led the way back. Before he followed her, the Sergeant relieved\r\nhis mind on the subject of the gravel walks by a parting word to the\r\ngardener. \xe2\x80\x9cGet her ladyship to try grass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sour look at\r\nthe paths. \xe2\x80\x9cNo gravel! no gravel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy Superintendent Seegrave should have appeared to be several sizes\r\nsmaller than life, on being presented to Sergeant Cuff, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nundertake to explain. I can only state the fact. They retired together;\r\nand remained a weary long time shut up from all mortal intrusion. When\r\nthey came out, Mr. Superintendent was excited, and Mr. Sergeant was\r\nyawning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sergeant wishes to see Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr.\r\nSeegrave, addressing me with great pomp and eagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sergeant\r\nmay have some questions to ask. Attend the Sergeant, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I was being ordered about in this way, I looked at the great\r\nCuff. The great Cuff, on his side, looked at Superintendent Seegrave in\r\nthat quietly expecting way which I have already noticed. I can\xe2\x80\x99t affirm\r\nthat he was on the watch for his brother officer\xe2\x80\x99s speedy appearance in\r\nthe character of an Ass\xe2\x80\x94I can only say that I strongly suspected it.\r\n\r\nI led the way upstairs. The Sergeant went softly all over the Indian\r\ncabinet and all round the \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir;\xe2\x80\x9d asking questions (occasionally\r\nonly of Mr. Superintendent, and continually of me), the drift of which\r\nI believe to have been equally unintelligible to both of us. In due\r\ntime, his course brought him to the door, and put him face to face with\r\nthe decorative painting that you know of. He laid one lean inquiring\r\nfinger on the small smear, just under the lock, which Superintendent\r\nSeegrave had already noticed, when he reproved the women-servants for\r\nall crowding together into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the question to me. I answered that the women-servants had\r\ncrowded into the room on the previous morning, and that some of their\r\npetticoats had done the mischief, \xe2\x80\x9cSuperintendent Seegrave ordered them\r\nout, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore they did any more harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Superintendent in his military way. \xe2\x80\x9cI ordered them\r\nout. The petticoats did it, Sergeant\xe2\x80\x94the petticoats did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice which petticoat did it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sergeant Cuff, still\r\naddressing himself, not to his brother-officer, but to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to Superintendent Seegrave upon that, and said, \xe2\x80\x9c_You_\r\nnoticed, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent looked a little taken aback; but he made the best of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t charge my memory, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca mere trifle\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmere trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff looked at Mr. Seegrave, as he had looked at the gravel\r\nwalks in the rosery, and gave us, in his melancholy way, the first\r\ntaste of his quality which we had had yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made a private inquiry last week, Mr. Superintendent,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\none end of the inquiry there was a murder, and at the other end there\r\nwas a spot of ink on a table cloth that nobody could account for. In\r\nall my experience along the dirtiest ways of this dirty little world, I\r\nhave never met with such a thing as a trifle yet. Before we go a step\r\nfurther in this business we must see the petticoat that made the smear,\r\nand we must know for certain when that paint was wet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Superintendent\xe2\x80\x94taking his set-down rather sulkily\xe2\x80\x94asked if he\r\nshould summon the women. Sergeant Cuff, after considering a minute,\r\nsighed, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll take the matter of the paint first. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nquestion of Yes or No with the paint\xe2\x80\x94which is short. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of\r\npetticoats with the women\xe2\x80\x94which is long. What o\xe2\x80\x99clock was it when the\r\nservants were in this room yesterday morning? Eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94eh? Is\r\nthere anybody in the house who knows whether that paint was wet or dry,\r\nat eleven yesterday morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, Mr. Franklin Blake, knows,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the gentleman in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin was as close at hand as could be\xe2\x80\x94waiting for his first\r\nchance of being introduced to the great Cuff. In half a minute he was\r\nin the room, and was giving his evidence as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat door, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chas been painted by Miss Verinder,\r\nunder my inspection, with my help, and in a vehicle of my own\r\ncomposition. The vehicle dries whatever colours may be used with it, in\r\ntwelve hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember when the smeared bit was done, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nSergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the last morsel of the\r\ndoor to be finished. We wanted to get it done, on Wednesday last\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nmyself completed it by three in the afternoon, or soon after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday is Friday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, addressing himself to\r\nSuperintendent Seegrave. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us reckon back, sir. At three on the\r\nWednesday afternoon, that bit of the painting was completed. The\r\nvehicle dried it in twelve hours\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, dried it by three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock on Thursday morning. At eleven on Thursday morning you held\r\nyour inquiry here. Take three from eleven, and eight remains. That\r\npaint had been _eight hours dry_, Mr. Superintendent, when you supposed\r\nthat the women-servants\xe2\x80\x99 petticoats smeared it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFirst knock-down blow for Mr. Seegrave! If he had not suspected poor\r\nPenelope, I should have pitied him.\r\n\r\nHaving settled the question of the paint, Sergeant Cuff, from that\r\nmoment, gave his brother-officer up as a bad job\xe2\x80\x94and addressed himself\r\nto Mr. Franklin, as the more promising assistant of the two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite on the cards, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have put the clue\r\ninto our hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the words passed his lips, the bedroom door opened, and Miss Rachel\r\ncame out among us suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe addressed herself to the Sergeant, without appearing to notice (or\r\nto heed) that he was a perfect stranger to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, pointing to Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat _he_ had put\r\nthe clue into your hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Miss Verinder,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered, behind the Sergeant.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat gentleman, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x94with his steely-grey eyes\r\ncarefully studying my young lady\xe2\x80\x99s face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas possibly put the clue into\r\nour hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned for one moment, and tried to look at Mr. Franklin. I say,\r\ntried, for she suddenly looked away again before their eyes met. There\r\nseemed to be some strange disturbance in her mind. She coloured up, and\r\nthen she turned pale again. With the paleness, there came a new look\r\ninto her face\xe2\x80\x94a look which it startled me to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving answered your question, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg leave\r\nto make an inquiry in my turn. There is a smear on the painting of your\r\ndoor, here. Do you happen to know when it was done? or who did it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of making any reply, Miss Rachel went on with her questions, as\r\nif he had not spoken, or as if she had not heard him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you another police-officer?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Sergeant Cuff, miss, of the Detective Police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s advice worth having?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to hear it, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo your duty by yourself\xe2\x80\x94and don\xe2\x80\x99t allow Mr Franklin Blake to help\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said those words so spitefully, so savagely, with such an\r\nextraordinary outbreak of ill-will towards Mr. Franklin, in her voice\r\nand in her look, that\xe2\x80\x94though I had known her from a baby, though I\r\nloved and honoured her next to my lady herself\xe2\x80\x94I was ashamed of Miss\r\nRachel for the first time in my life.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s immovable eyes never stirred from off her face. \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to know anything about the smear?\r\nMight you have done it by accident yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about the smear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer, she turned away, and shut herself up again in her\r\nbedroom. This time, I heard her\xe2\x80\x94as Penelope had heard her before\xe2\x80\x94burst\r\nout crying as soon as she was alone again.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to look at the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x94I looked at Mr.\r\nFranklin, who stood nearest to me. He seemed to be even more sorely\r\ndistressed at what had passed than I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you I was uneasy about her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you see why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Verinder appears to be a little out of temper about the loss of\r\nher Diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a valuable jewel. Natural\r\nenough! natural enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was the excuse that I had made for her (when she forgot herself\r\nbefore Superintendent Seegrave, on the previous day) being made for her\r\nover again, by a man who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had _my_ interest in making\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94for he was a perfect stranger! A kind of cold shudder ran through\r\nme, which I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t account for at the time. I know, now, that I must\r\nhave got my first suspicion, at that moment, of a new light (and horrid\r\nlight) having suddenly fallen on the case, in the mind of Sergeant\r\nCuff\xe2\x80\x94purely and entirely in consequence of what he had seen in Miss\r\nRachel, and heard from Miss Rachel, at that first interview between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young lady\xe2\x80\x99s tongue is a privileged member, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant\r\nto Mr. Franklin. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us forget what has passed, and go straight on\r\nwith this business. Thanks to you, we know when the paint was dry. The\r\nnext thing to discover is when the paint was last seen without that\r\nsmear. _You_ have got a head on your shoulders\xe2\x80\x94and you understand what\r\nI mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin composed himself, and came back with an effort from Miss\r\nRachel to the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more we narrow the question of\r\ntime, the more we also narrow the field of inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice your work here, on\r\nthe Wednesday afternoon, after you had done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin shook his head, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sergeant Cuff, turning to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I did either, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the last person in the room, the last thing on Wednesday\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Rachel, I suppose, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin struck in there, \xe2\x80\x9cOr possibly your daughter, Betteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe turned to Sergeant Cuff, and explained that my daughter was Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge, ask your daughter to step up. Stop!\xe2\x80\x9d says the\r\nSergeant, taking me away to the window, out of earshot, \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nSuperintendent here,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9chas made a pretty full\r\nreport to me of the manner in which he has managed this case. Among\r\nother things, he has, by his own confession, set the servants\xe2\x80\x99 backs\r\nup. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important to smooth them down again. Tell your daughter,\r\nand tell the rest of them, these two things, with my compliments:\r\nFirst, that I have no evidence before me, yet, that the Diamond has\r\nbeen stolen; I only know that the Diamond has been lost. Second, that\r\n_my_ business here with the servants is simply to ask them to lay their\r\nheads together and help me to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy experience of the women-servants, when Superintendent Seegrave laid\r\nhis embargo on their rooms, came in handy here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I make so bold, Sergeant, as to tell the women a third thing?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they free (with your compliments) to fidget up and\r\ndownstairs, and whisk in and out of their bedrooms, if the fit takes\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly free,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_That_ will smooth them down, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the cook to the\r\nscullion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, and do it at once, Mr. Betteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did it in less than five minutes. There was only one difficulty when\r\nI came to the bit about the bedrooms. It took a pretty stiff exertion\r\nof my authority, as chief, to prevent the whole of the female household\r\nfrom following me and Penelope upstairs, in the character of volunteer\r\nwitnesses in a burning fever of anxiety to help Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant seemed to approve of Penelope. He became a trifle less\r\ndreary; and he looked much as he had looked when he noticed the white\r\nmusk rose in the flower-garden. Here is my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, as\r\ndrawn off from her by the Sergeant. She gave it, I think, very\r\nprettily\xe2\x80\x94but, there! she is my child all over: nothing of her mother in\r\nher; Lord bless you, nothing of her mother in her!\r\n\r\nPenelope examined: Took a lively interest in the painting on the door,\r\nhaving helped to mix the colours. Noticed the bit of work under the\r\nlock, because it was the last bit done. Had seen it, some hours\r\nafterwards, without a smear. Had left it, as late as twelve at night,\r\nwithout a smear. Had, at that hour, wished her young lady good-night in\r\nthe bedroom; had heard the clock strike in the \xe2\x80\x9cboudoir\xe2\x80\x9d; had her hand\r\nat the time on the handle of the painted door; knew the paint was wet\r\n(having helped to mix the colours, as aforesaid); took particular pains\r\nnot to touch it; could swear that she held up the skirts of her dress,\r\nand that there was no smear on the paint then; could _not_ swear that\r\nher dress mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have touched it accidentally in going out;\r\nremembered the dress she had on, because it was new, a present from\r\nMiss Rachel; her father remembered, and could speak to it, too; could,\r\nand would, and did fetch it; dress recognised by her father as the\r\ndress she wore that night; skirts examined, a long job from the size of\r\nthem; not the ghost of a paint-stain discovered anywhere. End of\r\nPenelope\xe2\x80\x99s evidence\xe2\x80\x94and very pretty and convincing, too. Signed,\r\nGabriel Betteredge.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s next proceeding was to question me about any large dogs\r\nin the house who might have got into the room, and done the mischief\r\nwith a whisk of their tails. Hearing that this was impossible, he next\r\nsent for a magnifying-glass, and tried how the smear looked, seen that\r\nway. No skin-mark (as of a human hand) printed off on the paint. All\r\nthe signs visible\xe2\x80\x94signs which told that the paint had been smeared by\r\nsome loose article of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s dress touching it in going by. That\r\nsomebody (putting together Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevidence) must have been in the room, and done the mischief, between\r\nmidnight and three o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nHaving brought his investigation to this point, Sergeant Cuff\r\ndiscovered that such a person as Superintendent Seegrave was still left\r\nin the room, upon which he summed up the proceedings for his\r\nbrother-officer\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis trifle of yours, Mr. Superintendent,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, pointing\r\nto the place on the door, \xe2\x80\x9chas grown a little in importance since you\r\nnoticed it last. At the present stage of the inquiry there are, as I\r\ntake it, three discoveries to make, starting from that smear. Find out\r\n(first) whether there is any article of dress in this house with the\r\nsmear of the paint on it. Find out (second) who that dress belongs to.\r\nFind out (third) how the person can account for having been in this\r\nroom, and smeared the paint, between midnight and three in the morning.\r\nIf the person can\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy you, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t far to look for the hand\r\nthat has got the Diamond. I\xe2\x80\x99ll work this by myself, if you please, and\r\ndetain you no longer from your regular business in the town. You have\r\ngot one of your men here, I see. Leave him here at my disposal, in case\r\nI want him\xe2\x80\x94and allow me to wish you good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Seegrave\xe2\x80\x99s respect for the Sergeant was great; but his\r\nrespect for himself was greater still. Hit hard by the celebrated Cuff,\r\nhe hit back smartly, to the best of his ability, on leaving the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have abstained from expressing any opinion, so far,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr.\r\nSuperintendent, with his military voice still in good working order. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave now only one remark to offer on leaving this case in your hands.\r\nThere _is_ such a thing, Sergeant, as making a mountain out of a\r\nmolehill. Good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is also such a thing as making nothing out of a molehill, in\r\nconsequence of your head being too high to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d Having returned his\r\nbrother-officer\xe2\x80\x99s compliments in those terms, Sergeant Cuff wheeled\r\nabout, and walked away to the window by himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin and I waited to see what was coming next. The Sergeant\r\nstood at the window with his hands in his pockets, looking out, and\r\nwhistling the tune of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose of Summer\xe2\x80\x9d softly to himself.\r\nLater in the proceedings, I discovered that he only forgot his manners\r\nso far as to whistle, when his mind was hard at work, seeing its way\r\ninch by inch to its own private ends, on which occasions \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose\r\nof Summer\xe2\x80\x9d evidently helped and encouraged him. I suppose it fitted in\r\nsomehow with his character. It reminded him, you see, of his favourite\r\nroses, and, as _he_ whistled it, it was the most melancholy tune going.\r\n\r\nTurning from the window, after a minute or two, the Sergeant walked\r\ninto the middle of the room, and stopped there, deep in thought, with\r\nhis eyes on Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door. After a little he roused\r\nhimself, nodded his head, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d and,\r\naddressing me, asked for ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 conversation with my mistress, at\r\nher ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nLeaving the room with this message, I heard Mr. Franklin ask the\r\nSergeant a question, and stopped to hear the answer also at the\r\nthreshold of the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess yet,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has stolen the\r\nDiamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Nobody has stolen the Diamond_,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nWe both started at that extraordinary view of the case, and both\r\nearnestly begged him to tell us what he meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pieces of the puzzle are not\r\nall put together yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nI found my lady in her own sitting room. She started and looked annoyed\r\nwhen I mentioned that Sergeant Cuff wished to speak to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Must_ I see him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you represent me, Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt at a loss to understand this, and showed it plainly, I suppose,\r\nin my face. My lady was so good as to explain herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid my nerves are a little shaken,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nsomething in that police-officer from London which I recoil from\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I have a presentiment that he is bringing trouble and\r\nmisery with him into the house. Very foolish, and very unlike _me_\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nso it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hardly knew what to say to this. The more I saw of Sergeant Cuff, the\r\nbetter I liked him. My lady rallied a little after having opened her\r\nheart to me\xe2\x80\x94being, naturally, a woman of a high courage, as I have\r\nalready told you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must see him, I must,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t prevail on myself\r\nto see him alone. Bring him in, Gabriel, and stay here as long as he\r\nstays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the first attack of the megrims that I remembered in my\r\nmistress since the time when she was a young girl. I went back to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cboudoir.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin strolled out into the garden, and joined Mr.\r\nGodfrey, whose time for departure was now drawing near. Sergeant Cuff\r\nand I went straight to my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nI declare my lady turned a shade paler at the sight of him! She\r\ncommanded herself, however, in other respects, and asked the Sergeant\r\nif he had any objection to my being present. She was so good as to add,\r\nthat I was her trusted adviser, as well as her old servant, and that in\r\nanything which related to the household I was the person whom it might\r\nbe most profitable to consult. The Sergeant politely answered that he\r\nwould take my presence as a favour, having something to say about the\r\nservants in general, and having found my experience in that quarter\r\nalready of some use to him. My lady pointed to two chairs, and we set\r\nin for our conference immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already formed an opinion on this case,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sergeant Cuff,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich I beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s permission to keep to myself for the\r\npresent. My business now is to mention what I have discovered upstairs\r\nin Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, and what I have decided (with your\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s leave) on doing next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then went into the matter of the smear on the paint, and stated the\r\nconclusions he drew from it\xe2\x80\x94just as he had stated them (only with\r\ngreater respect of language) to Superintendent Seegrave. \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x9cis certain. The Diamond is missing out of the\r\ndrawer in the cabinet. Another thing is next to certain. The marks from\r\nthe smear on the door must be on some article of dress belonging to\r\nsomebody in this house. We must discover that article of dress before\r\nwe go a step further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that discovery,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked my mistress, \xe2\x80\x9cimplies, I presume, the\r\ndiscovery of the thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t say the Diamond is stolen. I only\r\nsay, at present, that the Diamond is missing. The discovery of the\r\nstained dress may lead the way to finding it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship looked at me. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand this?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Cuff understands it, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you propose to discover the stained dress?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired my\r\nmistress, addressing herself once more to the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good\r\nservants, who have been with me for years, have, I am ashamed to say,\r\nhad their boxes and rooms searched already by the other officer. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t permit them to be insulted in that way a second time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(There was a mistress to serve! There was a woman in ten thousand, if\r\nyou like!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the very point I was about to put to your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other officer has done a world of harm to this inquiry,\r\nby letting the servants see that he suspected them. If I give them\r\ncause to think themselves suspected a second time, there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing\r\nwhat obstacles they may not throw in my way\xe2\x80\x94the women especially. At\r\nthe same time, their boxes _must_ be searched again\xe2\x80\x94for this plain\r\nreason, that the first investigation only looked for the Diamond, and\r\nthat the second investigation must look for the stained dress. I quite\r\nagree with you, my lady, that the servants\xe2\x80\x99 feelings ought to be\r\nconsulted. But I am equally clear that the servants\xe2\x80\x99 wardrobes ought to\r\nbe searched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis looked very like a dead-lock. My lady said so, in choicer language\r\nthan mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a plan to meet the difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyour ladyship will consent to it. I propose explaining the case to the\r\nservants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women will think themselves suspected directly,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\ninterrupting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe women won\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cif I can\r\ntell them I am going to examine the wardrobes of _everybody_\xe2\x80\x94from her\r\nladyship downwards\xe2\x80\x94who slept in the house on Wednesday night. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nmere formality,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a side look at my mistress; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nservants will accept it as even dealing between them and their betters;\r\nand, instead of hindering the investigation, they will make a point of\r\nhonour of assisting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the truth of that. My lady, after her first surprise was over,\r\nsaw the truth of it also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are certain the investigation is necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the shortest way that I can see, my lady, to the end we have in\r\nview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mistress rose to ring the bell for her maid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall speak to the\r\nservants,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the keys of my wardrobe in your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff stopped her by a very unexpected question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t we better make sure first,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the other ladies\r\nand gentlemen in the house will consent, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only other lady in the house is Miss Verinder,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my\r\nmistress, with a look of surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only gentlemen are my nephews,\r\nMr. Blake and Mr. Ablewhite. There is not the least fear of a refusal\r\nfrom any of the three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI reminded my lady here that Mr. Godfrey was going away. As I said the\r\nwords, Mr. Godfrey himself knocked at the door to say good-bye, and was\r\nfollowed in by Mr. Franklin, who was going with him to the station. My\r\nlady explained the difficulty. Mr. Godfrey settled it directly. He\r\ncalled to Samuel, through the window, to take his portmanteau upstairs\r\nagain, and he then put the key himself into Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nluggage can follow me to London,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the inquiry is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe Sergeant received the key with a becoming apology. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to\r\nput you to any inconvenience, sir, for a mere formality; but the\r\nexample of their betters will do wonders in reconciling the servants to\r\nthis inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Godfrey, after taking leave of my lady, in a most\r\nsympathising manner, left a farewell message for Miss Rachel, the terms\r\nof which made it clear to my mind that he had not taken No for an\r\nanswer, and that he meant to put the marriage question to her once\r\nmore, at the next opportunity. Mr. Franklin, on following his cousin\r\nout, informed the Sergeant that all his clothes were open to\r\nexamination, and that nothing he possessed was kept under lock and key.\r\nSergeant Cuff made his best acknowledgments. His views, you will\r\nobserve, had been met with the utmost readiness by my lady, by Mr.\r\nGodfrey, and by Mr. Franklin. There was only Miss. Rachel now wanting\r\nto follow their lead, before we called the servants together, and began\r\nthe search for the stained dress.\r\n\r\nMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s unaccountable objection to the Sergeant seemed to make our\r\nconference more distasteful to her than ever, as soon as we were left\r\nalone again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I send you down Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s keys,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cI presume I shall have done all you want of me for the present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore we begin, I\r\nshould like, if convenient, to have the washing-book. The stained\r\narticle of dress may be an article of linen. If the search leads to\r\nnothing, I want to be able to account next for all the linen in the\r\nhouse, and for all the linen sent to the wash. If there is an article\r\nmissing, there will be at least a presumption that it has got the\r\npaint-stain on it, and that it has been purposely made away with,\r\nyesterday or today, by the person owning it. Superintendent Seegrave,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded the Sergeant, turning to me, \xe2\x80\x9cpointed the attention of the\r\nwomen-servants to the smear, when they all crowded into the room on\r\nThursday morning. That _may_ turn out, Mr. Betteredge, to have been one\r\nmore of Superintendent Seegrave\xe2\x80\x99s many mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady desired me to ring the bell, and order the washing-book. She\r\nremained with us until it was produced, in case Sergeant Cuff had any\r\nfurther request to make of her after looking at it.\r\n\r\nThe washing-book was brought in by Rosanna Spearman. The girl had come\r\ndown to breakfast that morning miserably pale and haggard, but\r\nsufficiently recovered from her illness of the previous day to do her\r\nusual work. Sergeant Cuff looked attentively at our second housemaid\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nher face, when she came in; at her crooked shoulder, when she went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything more to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my lady, still as eager as\r\never to be out of the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s society.\r\n\r\nThe great Cuff opened the washing-book, understood it perfectly in half\r\na minute, and shut it up again. \xe2\x80\x9cI venture to trouble your ladyship\r\nwith one last question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the young woman who brought us\r\nthis book been in your employment as long as the other servants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I saw her,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was in prison\r\nfor theft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, there was no help for it, but to tell him the truth. My\r\nmistress dwelt strongly on Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s good conduct in her service, and\r\non the high opinion entertained of her by the matron at the\r\nReformatory. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect her, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d my lady added, in\r\nconclusion, very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told your ladyship that I don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect any person in\r\nthe house of thieving\xe2\x80\x94up to the present time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that answer, my lady rose to go upstairs, and ask for Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s keys. The Sergeant was beforehand with me in opening the door\r\nfor her. He made a very low bow. My lady shuddered as she passed him.\r\n\r\nWe waited, and waited, and no keys appeared. Sergeant Cuff made no\r\nremark to me. He turned his melancholy face to the window; he put his\r\nlanky hands into his pockets; and he whistled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose of Summer\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsoftly to himself.\r\n\r\nAt last, Samuel came in, not with the keys, but with a morsel of paper\r\nfor me. I got at my spectacles, with some fumbling and difficulty,\r\nfeeling the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s dismal eyes fixed on me all the time. There were\r\ntwo or three lines on the paper, written in pencil by my lady. They\r\ninformed me that Miss Rachel flatly refused to have her wardrobe\r\nexamined. Asked for her reasons, she had burst out crying. Asked again,\r\nshe had said: \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, because I won\xe2\x80\x99t. I must yield to force if you\r\nuse it, but I will yield to nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d I understood my lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisinclination to face Sergeant Cuff with such an answer from her\r\ndaughter as that. If I had not been too old for the amiable weaknesses\r\nof youth, I believe I should have blushed at the notion of facing him\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s keys?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy young lady refuses to have her wardrobe examined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant.\r\n\r\nHis voice was not quite in such a perfect state of discipline as his\r\nface. When he said \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said it in the tone of a man who had heard\r\nsomething which he expected to hear. He half angered and half\r\nfrightened me\xe2\x80\x94why, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell, but he did it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust the search be given up?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe search must be given up, because your\r\nyoung lady refuses to submit to it like the rest. We must examine all\r\nthe wardrobes in the house or none. Send Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s portmanteau to\r\nLondon by the next train, and return the washing-book, with my\r\ncompliments and thanks, to the young woman who brought it in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid the washing-book on the table, and taking out his penknife,\r\nbegan to trim his nails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be much disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff; \xe2\x80\x9cI am not much disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to make him explain himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should Miss Rachel put an obstacle in your way?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it her interest to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94wait a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleverer heads than mine might have seen his drift. Or a person less\r\nfond of Miss Rachel than I was, might have seen his drift. My lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorror of him might (as I have since thought) have meant that _she_ saw\r\nhis drift (as the scripture says) \xe2\x80\x9cin a glass darkly.\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it\r\nyet\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done next?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff finished the nail on which he was then at work, looked at\r\nit for a moment with a melancholy interest, and put up his penknife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome out into the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at the\r\nroses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe nearest way to the garden, on going out of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room,\r\nwas by the shrubbery path, which you already know of. For the sake of\r\nyour better understanding of what is now to come, I may add to this,\r\nthat the shrubbery path was Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s favourite walk. When he was\r\nout in the grounds, and when we failed to find him anywhere else, we\r\ngenerally found him here.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I must own that I am rather an obstinate old man. The more\r\nfirmly Sergeant Cuff kept his thoughts shut up from me, the more firmly\r\nI persisted in trying to look in at them. As we turned into the\r\nshrubbery path, I attempted to circumvent him in another way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things are now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was in your place, I should be at my\r\nwits\xe2\x80\x99 end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were in my place,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have\r\nformed an opinion\xe2\x80\x94and, as things are now, any doubt you might\r\npreviously have felt about your own conclusions would be completely set\r\nat rest. Never mind for the present what those conclusions are, Mr.\r\nBetteredge. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought you out here to draw me like a badger; I\r\nhave brought you out here to ask for some information. You might have\r\ngiven it to me no doubt, in the house, instead of out of it. But doors\r\nand listeners have a knack of getting together; and, in my line of\r\nlife, we cultivate a healthy taste for the open air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho was to circumvent _this_ man? I gave in\xe2\x80\x94and waited as patiently as\r\nI could to hear what was coming next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t enter into your young lady\xe2\x80\x99s motives,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sergeant went on;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe will only say it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity she declines to assist me, because, by so\r\ndoing, she makes this investigation more difficult than it might\r\notherwise have been. We must now try to solve the mystery of the smear\r\non the door\xe2\x80\x94which, you may take my word for it, means the mystery of\r\nthe Diamond also\xe2\x80\x94in some other way. I have decided to see the servants,\r\nand to search their thoughts and actions, Mr. Betteredge, instead of\r\nsearching their wardrobes. Before I begin, however, I want to ask you a\r\nquestion or two. You are an observant man\xe2\x80\x94did you notice anything\r\nstrange in any of the servants (making due allowance, of course, for\r\nfright and fluster), after the loss of the Diamond was found out? Any\r\nparticular quarrel among them? Anyone of them not in his or her usual\r\nspirits? Unexpectedly out of temper, for instance? or unexpectedly\r\ntaken ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had just time to think of Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s sudden illness at\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s dinner\xe2\x80\x94but not time to make any answer\xe2\x80\x94when I saw Sergeant\r\nCuff\xe2\x80\x99s eyes suddenly turn aside towards the shrubbery; and I heard him\r\nsay softly to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA touch of the rheumatics in my back,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, in a loud\r\nvoice, as if he wanted some third person to hear us. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a\r\nchange in the weather before long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few steps further brought us to the corner of the house. Turning off\r\nsharp to the right, we entered on the terrace, and went down, by the\r\nsteps in the middle, into the garden below. Sergeant Cuff stopped\r\nthere, in the open space, where we could see round us on every side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout that young person, Rosanna Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\nlikely, with her personal appearance, that she has got a lover. But,\r\nfor the girl\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, I must ask you at once whether _she_ has\r\nprovided herself with a sweetheart, poor wretch, like the rest of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat on earth did he mean, under present circumstances, by putting such\r\na question to me as that? I stared at him, instead of answering him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Rosanna Spearman hiding in the shrubbery as we went by,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you said \xe2\x80\x98Hullo\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94when I said \xe2\x80\x98Hullo!\xe2\x80\x99 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a sweetheart in the case, the\r\nhiding doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter. If there isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94as things are in this\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94the hiding is a highly suspicious circumstance, and it will be my\r\npainful duty to act on it accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name, was I to say to him? I knew the shrubbery was Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s favourite walk; I knew he would most likely turn that way\r\nwhen he came back from the station; I knew that Penelope had over and\r\nover again caught her fellow-servant hanging about there, and had\r\nalways declared to me that Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s object was to attract Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s attention. If my daughter was right, she might well have\r\nbeen lying in wait for Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s return when the Sergeant noticed\r\nher. I was put between the two difficulties of mentioning Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfanciful notion as if it was mine, or of leaving an unfortunate\r\ncreature to suffer the consequences, the very serious consequences, of\r\nexciting the suspicion of Sergeant Cuff. Out of pure pity for the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94on my soul and my character, out of pure pity for the girl\xe2\x80\x94I gave\r\nthe Sergeant the necessary explanations, and told him that Rosanna had\r\nbeen mad enough to set her heart on Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff never laughed. On the few occasions when anything amused\r\nhim, he curled up a little at the corners of the lips, nothing more. He\r\ncurled up now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better say she\xe2\x80\x99s mad enough to be an ugly girl and only a\r\nservant?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe falling in love with a gentleman of Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s manners and appearance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to _me_ to be the\r\nmaddest part of her conduct by any means. However, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad the thing\r\nis cleared up: it relieves one\xe2\x80\x99s mind to have things cleared up. Yes,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it a secret, Mr. Betteredge. I like to be tender to human\r\ninfirmity\xe2\x80\x94though I don\xe2\x80\x99t get many chances of exercising that virtue in\r\nmy line of life. You think Mr. Franklin Blake hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a suspicion of\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s fancy for him? Ah! he would have found it out fast enough if\r\nshe had been nice-looking. The ugly women have a bad time of it in this\r\nworld; let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it will be made up to them in another. You have got a\r\nnice garden here, and a well-kept lawn. See for yourself how much\r\nbetter the flowers look with grass about them instead of gravel. No,\r\nthank you. I won\xe2\x80\x99t take a rose. It goes to my heart to break them off\r\nthe stem. Just as it goes to your heart, you know, when there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsomething wrong in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall. Did you notice anything you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t account for in any of the servants when the loss of the\r\nDiamond was first found out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had got on very fairly well with Sergeant Cuff so far. But the\r\nslyness with which he slipped in that last question put me on my guard.\r\nIn plain English, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all relish the notion of helping his\r\ninquiries, when those inquiries took him (in the capacity of snake in\r\nthe grass) among my fellow-servants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept that we all lost our heads\r\ntogether, myself included.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all you have to tell me, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, with (as I flattered myself) an unmoved countenance, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s dismal eyes looked me hard in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chave you any objection to oblige me by\r\nshaking hands? I have taken an extraordinary liking to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Why he should have chosen the exact moment when I was deceiving him to\r\ngive me that proof of his good opinion, is beyond all comprehension! I\r\nfelt a little proud\xe2\x80\x94I really did feel a little proud of having been one\r\ntoo many at last for the celebrated Cuff!)\r\n\r\nWe went back to the house; the Sergeant requesting that I would give\r\nhim a room to himself, and then send in the servants (the indoor\r\nservants only), one after another, in the order of their rank, from\r\nfirst to last.\r\n\r\nI showed Sergeant Cuff into my own room, and then called the servants\r\ntogether in the hall. Rosanna Spearman appeared among them, much as\r\nusual. She was as quick in her way as the Sergeant in his, and I\r\nsuspect she had heard what he said to me about the servants in general,\r\njust before he discovered her. There she was, at any rate, looking as\r\nif she had never heard of such a place as the shrubbery in her life.\r\n\r\nI sent them in, one by one, as desired. The cook was the first to enter\r\nthe Court of Justice, otherwise my room. She remained but a short time.\r\nReport, on coming out: \xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Cuff is depressed in his spirits; but\r\nSergeant Cuff is a perfect gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d My lady\xe2\x80\x99s own maid followed.\r\nRemained much longer. Report, on coming out: \xe2\x80\x9cIf Sergeant Cuff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve a respectable woman, he might keep his opinion to himself, at\r\nany rate!\xe2\x80\x9d Penelope went next. Remained only a moment or two. Report,\r\non coming out: \xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Cuff is much to be pitied. He must have been\r\ncrossed in love, father, when he was a young man.\xe2\x80\x9d The first housemaid\r\nfollowed Penelope. Remained, like my lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, a long time. Report,\r\non coming out: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t enter her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s service, Mr. Betteredge,\r\nto be doubted to my face by a low police-officer!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosanna Spearman\r\nwent next. Remained longer than any of them. No report on coming\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94dead silence, and lips as pale as ashes. Samuel, the footman,\r\nfollowed Rosanna. Remained a minute or two. Report, on coming out:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever blacks Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s boots ought to be ashamed of himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNancy, the kitchen-maid, went last. Remained a minute or two. Report,\r\non coming out: \xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Cuff has a heart; _he_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cut jokes, Mr.\r\nBetteredge, with a poor hard-working girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoing into the Court of Justice, when it was all over, to hear if there\r\nwere any further commands for me, I found the Sergeant at his old\r\ntrick\xe2\x80\x94looking out of window, and whistling \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose of Summer\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny discoveries, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Rosanna Spearman asks leave to go out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9clet the\r\npoor thing go; but let me know first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI might as well have held my tongue about Rosanna and Mr. Franklin! It\r\nwas plain enough; the unfortunate girl had fallen under Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions, in spite of all I could do to prevent it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t think Rosanna is concerned in the loss of the\r\nDiamond?\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to say.\r\n\r\nThe corners of the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s melancholy mouth curled up, and he looked\r\nhard in my face, just as he had looked in the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I had better not tell you, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmight lose your head, you know, for the second time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to doubt whether I had been one too many for the celebrated\r\nCuff, after all! It was rather a relief to me that we were interrupted\r\nhere by a knock at the door, and a message from the cook. Rosanna\r\nSpearman _had_ asked to go out, for the usual reason, that her head was\r\nbad, and she wanted a breath of fresh air. At a sign from the Sergeant,\r\nI said, Yes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the servants\xe2\x80\x99 way out?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when the\r\nmessenger had gone. I showed him the servants\xe2\x80\x99 way out. \xe2\x80\x9cLock the door\r\nof your room,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cand if anybody asks for me, say I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin there, composing my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d He curled up again at the corners of the\r\nlips, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, under those circumstances, a devouring curiosity pushed me\r\non to make some discoveries for myself.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions of Rosanna had been roused\r\nby something that he had found out at his examination of the servants\r\nin my room. Now, the only two servants (excepting Rosanna herself) who\r\nhad remained under examination for any length of time, were my lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown maid and the first housemaid, those two being also the women who\r\nhad taken the lead in persecuting their unfortunate fellow-servant from\r\nthe first. Reaching these conclusions, I looked in on them, casually as\r\nit might be, in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, and, finding tea going forward,\r\ninstantly invited myself to that meal. (For, _nota bene_, a drop of tea\r\nis to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tongue what a drop of oil is to a wasting lamp.)\r\n\r\nMy reliance on the tea-pot, as an ally, did not go unrewarded. In less\r\nthan half an hour I knew as much as the Sergeant himself.\r\n\r\nMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid and the housemaid, had, it appeared, neither of them\r\nbelieved in Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s illness of the previous day. These two devils\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nask your pardon; but how else _can_ you describe a couple of spiteful\r\nwomen?\xe2\x80\x94had stolen upstairs, at intervals during the Thursday afternoon;\r\nhad tried Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s door, and found it locked; had knocked, and not\r\nbeen answered; had listened, and not heard a sound inside. When the\r\ngirl had come down to tea, and had been sent up, still out of sorts, to\r\nbed again, the two devils aforesaid had tried her door once more, and\r\nfound it locked; had looked at the keyhole, and found it stopped up;\r\nhad seen a light under the door at midnight, and had heard the\r\ncrackling of a fire (a fire in a servant\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom in the month of\r\nJune!) at four in the morning. All this they had told Sergeant Cuff,\r\nwho, in return for their anxiety to enlighten him, had eyed them with\r\nsour and suspicious looks, and had shown them plainly that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve either one or the other. Hence, the unfavourable reports of him\r\nwhich these two women had brought out with them from the examination.\r\nHence, also (without reckoning the influence of the tea-pot), their\r\nreadiness to let their tongues run to any length on the subject of the\r\nSergeant\xe2\x80\x99s ungracious behaviour to them.\r\n\r\nHaving had some experience of the great Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s roundabout ways, and\r\nhaving last seen him evidently bent on following Rosanna privately when\r\nshe went out for her walk, it seemed clear to me that he had thought it\r\nunadvisable to let the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid and the housemaid know how\r\nmaterially they had helped him. They were just the sort of women, if he\r\nhad treated their evidence as trustworthy, to have been puffed up by\r\nit, and to have said or done something which would have put Rosanna\r\nSpearman on her guard.\r\n\r\nI walked out in the fine summer afternoon, very sorry for the poor\r\ngirl, and very uneasy in my mind at the turn things had taken. Drifting\r\ntowards the shrubbery, some time later, there I met Mr. Franklin. After\r\nreturning from seeing his cousin off at the station, he had been with\r\nmy lady, holding a long conversation with her. She had told him of Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s unaccountable refusal to let her wardrobe be examined; and had\r\nput him in such low spirits about my young lady that he seemed to\r\nshrink from speaking on the subject. The family temper appeared in his\r\nface that evening, for the first time in my experience of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chow does the atmosphere of mystery and\r\nsuspicion in which we are all living now, agree with you? Do you\r\nremember that morning when I first came here with the Moonstone? I wish\r\nto God we had thrown it into the quicksand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter breaking out in that way, he abstained from speaking again until\r\nhe had composed himself. We walked silently, side by side, for a minute\r\nor two, and then he asked me what had become of Sergeant Cuff. It was\r\nimpossible to put Mr. Franklin off with the excuse of the Sergeant\r\nbeing in my room, composing his mind. I told him exactly what had\r\nhappened, mentioning particularly what my lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid and the\r\nhouse-maid had said about Rosanna Spearman.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s clear head saw the turn the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions had\r\ntaken, in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of the\r\ntradespeople declared he had met Rosanna yesterday, on the footway to\r\nFrizinghall, when we supposed her to be ill in her room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s maid and the other woman have spoken the truth, you may\r\ndepend upon it the tradesman _did_ meet her. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s attack of\r\nillness was a blind to deceive us. She had some guilty reason for going\r\nto the town secretly. The paint-stained dress is a dress of hers; and\r\nthe fire heard crackling in her room at four in the morning was a fire\r\nlit to destroy it. Rosanna Spearman has stolen the Diamond. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in\r\ndirectly, and tell my aunt the turn things have taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot just yet, if you please, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said a melancholy voice behind us.\r\n\r\nWe both turned about, and found ourselves face to face with Sergeant\r\nCuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not just yet?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, sir, if you tell her ladyship, her ladyship will tell Miss\r\nVerinder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose she does. What then?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin said those words with a\r\nsudden heat and vehemence, as if the Sergeant had mortally offended\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s wise, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cto put\r\nsuch a question as that to me\xe2\x80\x94at such a time as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence between them: Mr. Franklin walked close up\r\nto the Sergeant. The two looked each other straight in the face. Mr.\r\nFranklin spoke first, dropping his voice as suddenly as he had raised\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you know, Mr. Cuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are treading on\r\ndelicate ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time, by a good many hundreds, that I find myself\r\ntreading on delicate ground,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other, as immovable as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to understand that you forbid me to tell my aunt what has\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to understand, if you please, sir, that I throw up the case,\r\nif you tell Lady Verinder, or tell anybody, what has happened, until I\r\ngive you leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat settled it. Mr. Franklin had no choice but to submit. He turned\r\naway in anger\xe2\x80\x94and left us.\r\n\r\nI had stood there listening to them, all in a tremble; not knowing whom\r\nto suspect, or what to think next. In the midst of my confusion, two\r\nthings, however, were plain to me. First, that my young lady was, in\r\nsome unaccountable manner, at the bottom of the sharp speeches that had\r\npassed between them. Second, that they thoroughly understood each\r\nother, without having previously exchanged a word of explanation on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have done a very foolish\r\nthing in my absence. You have done a little detective business on your\r\nown account. For the future, perhaps you will be so obliging as to do\r\nyour detective business along with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took me by the arm, and walked me away with him along the road by\r\nwhich he had come. I dare say I had deserved his reproof\xe2\x80\x94but I was not\r\ngoing to help him to set traps for Rosanna Spearman, for all that.\r\nThief or no thief, legal or not legal, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94I pitied her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want of me?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, shaking him off, and stopping short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a little information about the country round here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t well object to improve Sergeant Cuff in his geography.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any path, in that direction, leading to the sea-beach from\r\nthis house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Sergeant. He pointed, as he spoke, to the\r\nfir-plantation which led to the Shivering Sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a path.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSide by side, in the grey of the summer evening, Sergeant Cuff and I\r\nset forth for the Shivering Sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant remained silent, thinking his own thoughts, till we\r\nentered the plantation of firs which led to the quicksand. There he\r\nroused himself, like a man whose mind was made up, and spoke to me\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas you have honoured me by taking an oar in\r\nmy boat, and as you may, I think, be of some assistance to me before\r\nthe evening is out, I see no use in our mystifying one another any\r\nlonger, and I propose to set you an example of plain speaking on my\r\nside. You are determined to give me no information to the prejudice of\r\nRosanna Spearman, because she has been a good girl to _you_, and\r\nbecause you pity her heartily. Those humane considerations do you a\r\nworld of credit, but they happen in this instance to be humane\r\nconsiderations clean thrown away. Rosanna Spearman is not in the\r\nslightest danger of getting into trouble\xe2\x80\x94no, not if I fix her with\r\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of the Diamond, on evidence which\r\nis as plain as the nose on your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that my lady won\xe2\x80\x99t prosecute?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that your lady _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ prosecute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cRosanna\r\nSpearman is simply an instrument in the hands of another person, and\r\nRosanna Spearman will be held harmless for that other person\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke like a man in earnest\xe2\x80\x94there was no denying that. Still, I felt\r\nsomething stirring uneasily against him in my mind. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you give\r\nthat other person a name?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t _you_, Mr. Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff stood stock-still, and surveyed me with a look of\r\nmelancholy interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always a pleasure to me to be tender towards human infirmity,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel particularly tender at the present moment, Mr.\r\nBetteredge, towards you. And you, with the same excellent motive, feel\r\nparticularly tender towards Rosanna Spearman, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Do you happen\r\nto know whether she has had a new outfit of linen lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat he meant by slipping in this extraordinary question unawares, I\r\nwas at a total loss to imagine. Seeing no possible injury to Rosanna if\r\nI owned the truth, I answered that the girl had come to us rather\r\nsparely provided with linen, and that my lady, in recompense for her\r\ngood conduct (I laid a stress on her good conduct), had given her a new\r\noutfit not a fortnight since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a miserable world,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cHuman life, Mr.\r\nBetteredge, is a sort of target\xe2\x80\x94misfortune is always firing at it, and\r\nalways hitting the mark. But for that outfit, we should have discovered\r\na new nightgown or petticoat among Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s things, and have nailed\r\nher in that way. You\xe2\x80\x99re not at a loss to follow me, are you? You have\r\nexamined the servants yourself, and you know what discoveries two of\r\nthem made outside Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s door. Surely you know what the girl was\r\nabout yesterday, after she was taken ill? You can\xe2\x80\x99t guess? Oh dear me,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s as plain as that strip of light there, at the end of the trees. At\r\neleven, on Thursday morning, Superintendent Seegrave (who is a mass of\r\nhuman infirmity) points out to all the women servants the smear on the\r\ndoor. Rosanna has her own reasons for suspecting her own things; she\r\ntakes the first opportunity of getting to her room, finds the\r\npaint-stain on her night-gown, or petticoat, or what not, shams ill and\r\nslips away to the town, gets the materials for making a new petticoat\r\nor nightgown, makes it alone in her room on the Thursday night, lights\r\na fire (not to destroy it; two of her fellow-servants are prying\r\noutside her door, and she knows better than to make a smell of burning,\r\nand to have a lot of tinder to get rid of)\xe2\x80\x94lights a fire, I say, to dry\r\nand iron the substitute dress after wringing it out, keeps the stained\r\ndress hidden (probably _on_ her), and is at this moment occupied in\r\nmaking away with it, in some convenient place, on that lonely bit of\r\nbeach ahead of us. I have traced her this evening to your fishing\r\nvillage, and to one particular cottage, which we may possibly have to\r\nvisit, before we go back. She stopped in the cottage for some time, and\r\nshe came out with (as I believe) something hidden under her cloak. A\r\ncloak (on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s back) is an emblem of charity\xe2\x80\x94it covers a multitude\r\nof sins. I saw her set off northwards along the coast, after leaving\r\nthe cottage. Is your sea-shore here considered a fine specimen of\r\nmarine landscape, Mr. Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d as shortly as might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTastes differ,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking at it from my point of\r\nview, I never saw a marine landscape that I admired less. If you happen\r\nto be following another person along your sea-coast, and if that person\r\nhappens to look round, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a scrap of cover to hide you\r\nanywhere. I had to choose between taking Rosanna in custody on\r\nsuspicion, or leaving her, for the time being, with her little game in\r\nher own hands. For reasons which I won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you with, I decided on\r\nmaking any sacrifice rather than give the alarm as soon as tonight to a\r\ncertain person who shall be nameless between us. I came back to the\r\nhouse to ask you to take me to the north end of the beach by another\r\nway. Sand\xe2\x80\x94in respect of its printing off people\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps\xe2\x80\x94is one of\r\nthe best detective officers I know. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t meet with Rosanna\r\nSpearman by coming round on her in this way, the sand may tell us what\r\nshe has been at, if the light only lasts long enough. Here _is_ the\r\nsand. If you will excuse my suggesting it\xe2\x80\x94suppose you hold your tongue,\r\nand let me go first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf there is such a thing known at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s shop as a\r\n_detective-fever_, that disease had now got fast hold of your humble\r\nservant. Sergeant Cuff went on between the hillocks of sand, down to\r\nthe beach. I followed him (with my heart in my mouth); and waited at a\r\nlittle distance for what was to happen next.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, I found myself standing nearly in the same place\r\nwhere Rosanna Spearman and I had been talking together when Mr.\r\nFranklin suddenly appeared before us, on arriving at our house from\r\nLondon. While my eyes were watching the Sergeant, my mind wandered away\r\nin spite of me to what had passed, on that former occasion, between\r\nRosanna and me. I declare I almost felt the poor thing slip her hand\r\nagain into mine, and give it a little grateful squeeze to thank me for\r\nspeaking kindly to her. I declare I almost heard her voice telling me\r\nagain that the Shivering Sand seemed to draw her to it against her own\r\nwill, whenever she went out\xe2\x80\x94almost saw her face brighten again, as it\r\nbrightened when she first set eyes upon Mr. Franklin coming briskly out\r\non us from among the hillocks. My spirits fell lower and lower as I\r\nthought of these things\xe2\x80\x94and the view of the lonesome little bay, when I\r\nlooked about to rouse myself, only served to make me feel more uneasy\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe last of the evening light was fading away; and over all the\r\ndesolate place there hung a still and awful calm. The heave of the main\r\nocean on the great sandbank out in the bay, was a heave that made no\r\nsound. The inner sea lay lost and dim, without a breath of wind to stir\r\nit. Patches of nasty ooze floated, yellow-white, on the dead surface of\r\nthe water. Scum and slime shone faintly in certain places, where the\r\nlast of the light still caught them on the two great spits of rock\r\njutting out, north and south, into the sea. It was now the time of the\r\nturn of the tide: and even as I stood there waiting, the broad brown\r\nface of the quicksand began to dimple and quiver\xe2\x80\x94the only moving thing\r\nin all the horrid place.\r\n\r\nI saw the Sergeant start as the shiver of the sand caught his eye.\r\nAfter looking at it for a minute or so, he turned and came back to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA treacherous place, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand no signs of\r\nRosanna Spearman anywhere on the beach, look where you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took me down lower on the shore, and I saw for myself that his\r\nfootsteps and mine were the only footsteps printed off on the sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does the fishing village bear, standing where we are now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nSergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered (that being the name of the place), \xe2\x80\x9cbears as\r\nnear as may be, due south.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the girl this evening, walking northward along the shore, from\r\nCobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cConsequently, she must have been\r\nwalking towards this place. Is Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole on the other side of that\r\npoint of land there? And can we get to it\xe2\x80\x94now it\xe2\x80\x99s low water\xe2\x80\x94by the\r\nbeach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d to both those questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my suggesting it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll step out briskly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to find the place where she left the shore, before it\r\ngets dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had walked, I should say, a couple of hundred yards towards Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHole, when Sergeant Cuff suddenly went down on his knees on the beach,\r\nto all appearance seized with a sudden frenzy for saying his prayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said for your marine landscape here, after\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are a woman\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, Mr.\r\nBetteredge! Let us call them Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, until we find\r\nevidence to the contrary that we can\xe2\x80\x99t resist. Very confused footsteps,\r\nyou will please to observe\xe2\x80\x94purposely confused, I should say. Ah, poor\r\nsoul, she understands the detective virtues of sand as well as I do!\r\nBut hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she been in rather too great a hurry to tread out the marks\r\nthoroughly? I think she has. Here\xe2\x80\x99s one footstep going _from_ Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHole; and here is another going back to it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the toe of her\r\nshoe pointing straight to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge? And don\xe2\x80\x99t I see two\r\nheel-marks further down the beach, close at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge also? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt your feelings, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid Rosanna is sly. It\r\nlooks as if she had determined to get to that place you and I have just\r\ncome from, without leaving any marks on the sand to trace her by. Shall\r\nwe say that she walked through the water from this point till she got\r\nto that ledge of rocks behind us, and came back the same way, and then\r\ntook to the beach again where those two heel marks are still left? Yes,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll say that. It seems to fit in with my notion that she had\r\nsomething under her cloak, when she left the cottage. No! not something\r\nto destroy\xe2\x80\x94for, in that case, where would have been the need of all\r\nthese precautions to prevent my tracing the place at which her walk\r\nended? Something to hide is, I think, the better guess of the two.\r\nPerhaps, if we go on to the cottage, we may find out what that\r\nsomething is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this proposal, my detective-fever suddenly cooled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe longer I know you, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe more\r\nvirtues I discover. Modesty\xe2\x80\x94oh dear me, how rare modesty is in this\r\nworld! and how much of that rarity you possess! If I go alone to the\r\ncottage, the people\xe2\x80\x99s tongues will be tied at the first question I put\r\nto them. If I go with you, I go introduced by a justly respected\r\nneighbour, and a flow of conversation is the necessary result. It\r\nstrikes me in that light; how does it strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot having an answer of the needful smartness as ready as I could have\r\nwished, I tried to gain time by asking him what cottage he wanted to go\r\nto.\r\n\r\nOn the Sergeant describing the place, I recognised it as a cottage\r\ninhabited by a fisherman named Yolland, with his wife and two grown-up\r\nchildren, a son and a daughter. If you will look back, you will find\r\nthat, in first presenting Rosanna Spearman to your notice, I have\r\ndescribed her as occasionally varying her walk to the Shivering Sand,\r\nby a visit to some friends of hers at Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole. Those friends were\r\nthe Yollands\xe2\x80\x94respectable, worthy people, a credit to the neighbourhood.\r\nRosanna\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with them had begun by means of the daughter,\r\nwho was afflicted with a misshapen foot, and who was known in our parts\r\nby the name of Limping Lucy. The two deformed girls had, I suppose, a\r\nkind of fellow-feeling for each other. Anyway, the Yollands and Rosanna\r\nalways appeared to get on together, at the few chances they had of\r\nmeeting, in a pleasant and friendly manner. The fact of Sergeant Cuff\r\nhaving traced the girl to _their_ cottage, set the matter of my helping\r\nhis inquiries in quite a new light. Rosanna had merely gone where she\r\nwas in the habit of going; and to show that she had been in company\r\nwith the fisherman and his family was as good as to prove that she had\r\nbeen innocently occupied so far, at any rate. It would be doing the\r\ngirl a service, therefore, instead of an injury, if I allowed myself to\r\nbe convinced by Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s logic. I professed myself convinced by\r\nit accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe went on to Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, seeing the footsteps on the sand, as long as\r\nthe light lasted.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the cottage, the fisherman and his son proved to be out in\r\nthe boat; and Limping Lucy, always weak and weary, was resting on her\r\nbed upstairs. Good Mrs. Yolland received us alone in her kitchen. When\r\nshe heard that Sergeant Cuff was a celebrated character in London, she\r\nclapped a bottle of Dutch gin and a couple of clean pipes on the table,\r\nand stared as if she could never see enough of him.\r\n\r\nI sat quiet in a corner, waiting to hear how the Sergeant would find\r\nhis way to the subject of Rosanna Spearman. His usual roundabout manner\r\nof going to work proved, on this occasion, to be more roundabout than\r\never. How he managed it is more than I could tell at the time, and more\r\nthan I can tell now. But this is certain, he began with the Royal\r\nFamily, the Primitive Methodists, and the price of fish; and he got\r\nfrom that (in his dismal, underground way) to the loss of the\r\nMoonstone, the spitefulness of our first house-maid, and the hard\r\nbehaviour of the women-servants generally towards Rosanna Spearman.\r\nHaving reached his subject in this fashion, he described himself as\r\nmaking his inquiries about the lost Diamond, partly with a view to find\r\nit, and partly for the purpose of clearing Rosanna from the unjust\r\nsuspicions of her enemies in the house. In about a quarter of an hour\r\nfrom the time when we entered the kitchen, good Mrs. Yolland was\r\npersuaded that she was talking to Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, and was\r\npressing Sergeant Cuff to comfort his stomach and revive his spirits\r\nout of the Dutch bottle.\r\n\r\nBeing firmly persuaded that the Sergeant was wasting his breath to no\r\npurpose on Mrs. Yolland, I sat enjoying the talk between them, much as\r\nI have sat, in my time, enjoying a stage play. The great Cuff showed a\r\nwonderful patience; trying his luck drearily this way and that way, and\r\nfiring shot after shot, as it were, at random, on the chance of hitting\r\nthe mark. Everything to Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s credit, nothing to Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprejudice\xe2\x80\x94that was how it ended, try as he might; with Mrs. Yolland\r\ntalking nineteen to the dozen, and placing the most entire confidence\r\nin him. His last effort was made, when we had looked at our watches,\r\nand had got on our legs previous to taking leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall now wish you good-night, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\nshall only say, at parting, that Rosanna Spearman has a sincere\r\nwell-wisher in myself, your obedient servant. But, oh dear me! she will\r\nnever get on in her present place; and my advice to her is\xe2\x80\x94leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your heart alive! she is _going_ to leave it!\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mrs.\r\nYolland. (_Nota bene_\xe2\x80\x94I translate Mrs. Yolland out of the Yorkshire\r\nlanguage into the English language. When I tell you that the\r\nall-accomplished Cuff was every now and then puzzled to understand her\r\nuntil I helped him, you will draw your own conclusions as to what\r\n_your_ state of mind would be if I reported her in her native tongue.)\r\n\r\nRosanna Spearman going to leave us! I pricked up my ears at that. It\r\nseemed strange, to say the least of it, that she should have given no\r\nwarning, in the first place, to my lady or to me. A certain doubt came\r\nup in my mind whether Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s last random shot might not have\r\nhit the mark. I began to question whether my share in the proceedings\r\nwas quite as harmless a one as I had thought it. It might be all in the\r\nway of the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s business to mystify an honest woman by wrapping\r\nher round in a network of lies but it was my duty to have remembered,\r\nas a good Protestant, that the father of lies is the Devil\xe2\x80\x94and that\r\nmischief and the Devil are never far apart. Beginning to smell mischief\r\nin the air, I tried to take Sergeant Cuff out. He sat down again\r\ninstantly, and asked for a little drop of comfort out of the Dutch\r\nbottle. Mrs Yolland sat down opposite to him, and gave him his nip. I\r\nwent on to the door, excessively uncomfortable, and said I thought I\r\nmust bid them good-night\xe2\x80\x94and yet I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she means to leave?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she to do when she\r\ndoes leave? Sad, sad! The poor creature has got no friends in the\r\nworld, except you and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but she has though!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cShe came in here, as I\r\ntold you, this evening; and, after sitting and talking a little with my\r\ngirl Lucy and me she asked to go upstairs by herself, into Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only room in our place where there\xe2\x80\x99s pen and ink. \xe2\x80\x98I want to\r\nwrite a letter to a friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she says \xe2\x80\x98and I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it for the prying\r\nand peeping of the servants up at the house.\xe2\x80\x99 Who the letter was\r\nwritten to I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you: it must have been a mortal long one,\r\njudging by the time she stopped upstairs over it. I offered her a\r\npostage-stamp when she came down. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got the letter in her\r\nhand, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t accept the stamp. A little close, poor soul (as\r\nyou know), about herself and her doings. But a friend she has got\r\nsomewhere, I can tell you; and to that friend you may depend upon it,\r\nshe will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as she can.\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland.\r\n\r\nHere I stepped in again from the door. As chief of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestablishment, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow this sort of loose talk about a servant\r\nof ours going, or not going, to proceed any longer in my presence,\r\nwithout noticing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be mistaken about Rosanna Spearman,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had been\r\ngoing to leave her present situation, she would have mentioned it, in\r\nthe first place, to _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistaken?\xe2\x80\x9d cries Mrs. Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, only an hour ago she bought some\r\nthings she wanted for travelling\xe2\x80\x94of my own self, Mr. Betteredge, in\r\nthis very room. And that reminds me,\xe2\x80\x9d says the wearisome woman,\r\nsuddenly beginning to feel in her pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cof something I have got it\r\non my mind to say about Rosanna and her money. Are you either of you\r\nlikely to see her when you go back to the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a message to the poor thing, with the greatest pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Sergeant Cuff, before I could put in a word edgewise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Yolland produced out of her pocket, a few shillings and sixpences,\r\nand counted them out with a most particular and exasperating\r\ncarefulness in the palm of her hand. She offered the money to the\r\nSergeant, looking mighty loth to part with it all the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I ask you to give this back to Rosanna, with my love and\r\nrespects?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cShe insisted on paying me for the one or\r\ntwo things she took a fancy to this evening\xe2\x80\x94and money\xe2\x80\x99s welcome enough\r\nin our house, I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m not easy in my mind about\r\ntaking the poor thing\xe2\x80\x99s little savings. And to tell you the truth, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think my man would like to hear that I had taken Rosanna\r\nSpearman\xe2\x80\x99s money, when he comes back tomorrow morning from his work.\r\nPlease say she\xe2\x80\x99s heartily welcome to the things she bought of me\xe2\x80\x94as a\r\ngift. And don\xe2\x80\x99t leave the money on the table,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland,\r\nputting it down suddenly before the Sergeant, as if it burnt her\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good man! For times are hard, and flesh is\r\nweak; and I _might_ feel tempted to put it back in my pocket again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer: I must go back to the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you directly,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nFor the second time, I went to the door; and, for the second time, try\r\nas I might, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cross the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a delicate matter, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard the Sergeant say, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving\r\nmoney back. You charged her cheap for the things, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheap!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and judge for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the candle and led the Sergeant to a corner of the kitchen.\r\nFor the life of me, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help following them. Shaken down in the\r\ncorner was a heap of odds and ends (mostly old metal), which the\r\nfisherman had picked up at different times from wrecked ships, and\r\nwhich he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found a market for yet, to his own mind. Mrs. Yolland\r\ndived into this rubbish, and brought up an old japanned tin case, with\r\na cover to it, and a hasp to hang it up by\xe2\x80\x94the sort of thing they use,\r\non board ship, for keeping their maps and charts, and such-like, from\r\nthe wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d says she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Rosanna came in this evening, she bought the\r\nfellow to that. \xe2\x80\x98It will just do,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98to put my cuffs and\r\ncollars in, and keep them from being crumpled in my box.\xe2\x80\x99 One and\r\nninepence, Mr. Cuff. As I live by bread, not a halfpenny more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirt cheap!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\nHe weighed the case in his hand. I thought I heard a note or two of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose of Summer\xe2\x80\x9d as he looked at it. There was no doubt now!\r\nHe had made another discovery to the prejudice of Rosanna Spearman, in\r\nthe place of all others where I thought her character was safest, and\r\nall through me! I leave you to imagine what I felt, and how sincerely I\r\nrepented having been the medium of introduction between Mrs. Yolland\r\nand Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe really must go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout paying the least attention to me, Mrs. Yolland took another\r\ndive into the rubbish, and came up out of it, this time, with a\r\ndog-chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeigh it in your hand, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had three\r\nof these; and Rosanna has taken two of them. \xe2\x80\x98What can you want, my\r\ndear, with a couple of dog\xe2\x80\x99s chains?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98If I join them together\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll do round my box nicely,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98Rope\xe2\x80\x99s cheapest,\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chain\xe2\x80\x99s surest,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. \xe2\x80\x98Who ever heard of a box corded with\r\nchain,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mrs. Yolland, don\xe2\x80\x99t make objections!\xe2\x80\x99 says she;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98let me have my chains!\xe2\x80\x99 A strange girl, Mr. Cuff\xe2\x80\x94good as gold, and\r\nkinder than a sister to my Lucy\xe2\x80\x94but always a little strange. There! I\r\nhumoured her. Three and sixpence. On the word of an honest woman, three\r\n_and_ sixpence, Mr. Cuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach?\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth together!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cThree and sixpence for the two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven away, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cClean given\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the money,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland, getting back sideways to the\r\nlittle heap of silver on the table, as if it drew her in spite of\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tin case and the dog chains were all she bought, and all\r\nshe took away. One and ninepence and three and sixpence\xe2\x80\x94total, five and\r\nthree. With my love and respects\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it in my conscience\r\nto take a poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s savings, when she may want them herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t find it in _my_ conscience, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to give the money back,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsays Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have as good as made her a present of the\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94you have indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your sincere opinion, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland brightening up\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can\xe2\x80\x99t be a doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mr.\r\nBetteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no use asking _me_. All they got out of _me_ was, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother the money!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs. Yolland. With these words, she appeared\r\nto lose all command over herself; and, making a sudden snatch at the\r\nheap of silver, put it back, holus-bolus, in her pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cIt upsets\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s temper, it does, to see it lying there, and nobody taking it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncries this unreasonable woman, sitting down with a thump, and looking\r\nat Sergeant Cuff, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in my pocket again now\xe2\x80\x94get\r\nit out if you can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time, I not only went to the door, but went fairly out on the road\r\nback. Explain it how you may, I felt as if one or both of them had\r\nmortally offended me. Before I had taken three steps down the village,\r\nI heard the Sergeant behind me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your introduction, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nindebted to the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s wife for an entirely new sensation. Mrs.\r\nYolland has puzzled me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to have given him a sharp answer, for no\r\nbetter reason than this\xe2\x80\x94that I was out of temper with him, because I\r\nwas out of temper with myself. But when he owned to being puzzled, a\r\ncomforting doubt crossed my mind whether any great harm had been done\r\nafter all. I waited in discreet silence to hear more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, as if he was actually reading my thoughts in\r\nthe dark. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of putting me on the scent, it may console you to\r\nknow, Mr. Betteredge (with your interest in Rosanna), that you have\r\nbeen the means of throwing me off. What the girl has done, tonight, is\r\nclear enough, of course. She has joined the two chains, and has\r\nfastened them to the hasp in the tin case. She has sunk the case, in\r\nthe water or in the quicksand. She has made the loose end of the chain\r\nfast to some place under the rocks, known only to herself. And she will\r\nleave the case secure at its anchorage till the present proceedings\r\nhave come to an end; after which she can privately pull it up again out\r\nof its hiding-place, at her own leisure and convenience. All perfectly\r\nplain, so far. But,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, with the first tone of\r\nimpatience in his voice that I had heard yet, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mystery is\xe2\x80\x94what the\r\ndevil has she hidden in the tin case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Moonstone!\xe2\x80\x9d But I only said to Sergeant Cuff,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the Diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole experience of my\r\nlife is at fault, if Rosanna Spearman has got the Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing those words, the infernal detective-fever began, I suppose,\r\nto burn in me again. At any rate, I forgot myself in the interest of\r\nguessing this new riddle. I said rashly, \xe2\x80\x9cThe stained dress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff stopped short in the dark, and laid his hand on my arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs anything thrown into that quicksand of yours, ever thrown up on the\r\nsurface again?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLight or heavy whatever goes into the Shivering\r\nSand is sucked down, and seen no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Rosanna Spearman know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows it as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat on earth has she got to do but to tie\r\nup a bit of stone in the stained dress and throw it into the quicksand?\r\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t the shadow of a reason why she should have hidden it\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyet she _must_ have hidden it. Query,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, walking on\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x9cis the paint-stained dress a petticoat or a night-gown? or is\r\nit something else which there is a reason for preserving at any risk?\r\nMr. Betteredge, if nothing occurs to prevent it, I must go to\r\nFrizinghall tomorrow, and discover what she bought in the town, when\r\nshe privately got the materials for making the substitute dress. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nrisk to leave the house, as things are now\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s a worse risk still\r\nto stir another step in this matter in the dark. Excuse my being a\r\nlittle out of temper; I\xe2\x80\x99m degraded in my own estimation\xe2\x80\x94I have let\r\nRosanna Spearman puzzle me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we got back, the servants were at supper. The first person we saw\r\nin the outer yard was the policeman whom Superintendent Seegrave had\r\nleft at the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s disposal. The Sergeant asked if Rosanna Spearman\r\nhad returned. Yes. When? Nearly an hour since. What had she done? She\r\nhad gone upstairs to take off her bonnet and cloak\xe2\x80\x94and she was now at\r\nsupper quietly with the rest.\r\n\r\nWithout making any remark, Sergeant Cuff walked on, sinking lower and\r\nlower in his own estimation, to the back of the house. Missing the\r\nentrance in the dark, he went on (in spite of my calling to him) till\r\nhe was stopped by a wicket-gate which led into the garden. When I\r\njoined him to bring him back by the right way, I found that he was\r\nlooking up attentively at one particular window, on the bedroom floor,\r\nat the back of the house.\r\n\r\nLooking up, in my turn, I discovered that the object of his\r\ncontemplation was the window of Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s room, and that lights\r\nwere passing backwards and forwards there as if something unusual was\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s room?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nI replied that it was, and invited him to go in with me to supper. The\r\nSergeant remained in his place, and said something about enjoying the\r\nsmell of the garden at night. I left him to his enjoyment. Just as I\r\nwas turning in at the door, I heard \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose of Summer\xe2\x80\x9d at the\r\nwicket-gate. Sergeant Cuff had made another discovery! And my young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s window was at the bottom of it this time!\r\n\r\nThe latter reflection took me back again to the Sergeant, with a polite\r\nintimation that I could not find it in my heart to leave him by\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand up there?\xe2\x80\x9d I added,\r\npointing to Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s window.\r\n\r\nJudging by his voice, Sergeant Cuff had suddenly risen again to the\r\nright place in his own estimation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are great people for betting in\r\nYorkshire, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I was a Yorkshireman,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the Sergeant, taking my arm, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould lay you an even sovereign, Mr. Betteredge, that your young lady\r\nhas suddenly resolved to leave the house. If I won on that event, I\r\nshould offer to lay another sovereign, that the idea has occurred to\r\nher within the last hour.\xe2\x80\x9d The first of the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s guesses startled\r\nme. The second mixed itself up somehow in my head with the report we\r\nhad heard from the policeman, that Rosanna Spearman had returned from\r\nthe sands within the last hour. The two together had a curious effect\r\non me as we went in to supper. I shook off Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and,\r\nforgetting my manners, pushed by him through the door to make my own\r\ninquiries for myself.\r\n\r\nSamuel, the footman, was the first person I met in the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer ladyship is waiting to see you and Sergeant Cuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before\r\nI could put any questions to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has she been waiting?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last hour, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere it was again! Rosanna had come back; Miss Rachel had taken some\r\nresolution out of the common; and my lady had been waiting to see the\r\nSergeant\xe2\x80\x94all within the last hour! It was not pleasant to find these\r\nvery different persons and things linking themselves together in this\r\nway. I went on upstairs, without looking at Sergeant Cuff, or speaking\r\nto him. My hand took a sudden fit of trembling as I lifted it to knock\r\nat my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the Sergeant over my shoulder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif a scandal was to burst up in the house tonight. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed! I\r\nhave put the muzzle on worse family difficulties than this, in my\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said the words I heard my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s voice calling to us to come\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWe found my lady with no light in the room but the reading-lamp. The\r\nshade was screwed down so as to overshadow her face. Instead of looking\r\nup at us in her usual straightforward way, she sat close at the table,\r\nand kept her eyes fixed obstinately on an open book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis it important to the inquiry you are\r\nconducting, to know beforehand if any person now in this house wishes\r\nto leave it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost important, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to tell you, then, that Miss Verinder proposes going to stay\r\nwith her aunt, Mrs. Ablewhite, of Frizinghall. She has arranged to\r\nleave us the first thing tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff looked at me. I made a step forward to speak to my\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x94and, feeling my heart fail me (if I must own it), took a step\r\nback again, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask your ladyship _when_ Miss Verinder informed you that she was\r\ngoing to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout an hour since,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my mistress.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff looked at me once more. They say old people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts are\r\nnot very easily moved. _My_ heart couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thumped much harder\r\nthan it did now, if I had been five-and-twenty again!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no claim, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cto control Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s actions. All I can ask you to do is to put off her\r\ndeparture, if possible, till later in the day. I must go to Frizinghall\r\nmyself tomorrow morning\xe2\x80\x94and I shall be back by two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, if not\r\nbefore. If Miss Verinder can be kept here till that time, I should wish\r\nto say two words to her\xe2\x80\x94unexpectedly\xe2\x80\x94before she goes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady directed me to give the coachman her orders, that the carriage\r\nwas not to come for Miss Rachel until two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you more to\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of the Sergeant, when this had been done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one thing, your ladyship. If Miss Verinder is surprised at this\r\nchange in the arrangements, please not to mention Me as being the cause\r\nof putting off her journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mistress lifted her head suddenly from her book as if she was going\r\nto say something\xe2\x80\x94checked herself by a great effort\xe2\x80\x94and, looking back\r\nagain at the open page, dismissed us with a sign of her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, when we were out in the\r\nhall again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for her self-control, the mystery that puzzles you,\r\nMr. Betteredge, would have been at an end tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words, the truth rushed at last into my stupid old head. For\r\nthe moment, I suppose I must have gone clean out of my senses. I seized\r\nthe Sergeant by the collar of his coat, and pinned him against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn you!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong about Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou have been hiding it from me all this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff looked up at me\xe2\x80\x94flat against the wall\xe2\x80\x94without stirring a\r\nhand, or moving a muscle of his melancholy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve guessed it at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy hand dropped from his collar, and my head sunk on my breast. Please\r\nto remember, as some excuse for my breaking out as I did, that I had\r\nserved the family for fifty years. Miss Rachel had climbed upon my\r\nknees, and pulled my whiskers, many and many a time when she was a\r\nchild. Miss Rachel, with all her faults, had been, to my mind, the\r\ndearest and prettiest and best young mistress that ever an old servant\r\nwaited on, and loved. I begged Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, but I am\r\nafraid I did it with watery eyes, and not in a very becoming way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, with more\r\nkindness than I had any right to expect from him. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my line of life\r\nif we were quick at taking offence, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worth salt to our\r\nporridge. If it\xe2\x80\x99s any comfort to you, collar me again. You don\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast know how to do it; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll overlook your awkwardness in\r\nconsideration of your feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe curled up at the corners of his lips, and, in his own dreary way,\r\nseemed to think he had delivered himself of a very good joke.\r\n\r\nI led him into my own little sitting-room, and closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the truth, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suspect? It\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nkindness to hide it from me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cI know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy unlucky temper began to get the better of me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me, in plain English,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Rachel\r\nhas stolen her own Diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is what I mean to tell you, in so many\r\nwords. Miss Verinder has been in secret possession of the Moonstone\r\nfrom first to last; and she has taken Rosanna Spearman into her\r\nconfidence, because she has calculated on our suspecting Rosanna\r\nSpearman of the theft. There is the whole case in a nutshell. Collar me\r\nagain, Mr. Betteredge. If it\xe2\x80\x99s any vent to your feelings, collar me\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGod help me! my feelings were not to be relieved in that way. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me\r\nyour reasons!\xe2\x80\x9d That was all I could say to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear my reasons tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss\r\nVerinder refuses to put off her visit to her aunt (which you will find\r\nMiss Verinder will do), I shall be obliged to lay the whole case before\r\nyour mistress tomorrow. And, as I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what may come of it, I\r\nshall request you to be present, and to hear what passes on both sides.\r\nLet the matter rest for tonight. No, Mr. Betteredge, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a\r\nword more on the subject of the Moonstone out of me. There is your\r\ntable spread for supper. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the many human infirmities which\r\nI always treat tenderly. If you will ring the bell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say grace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For what we are going to receive\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you a good appetite to it, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9c_My_ appetite is\r\ngone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait and see you served, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you to excuse me,\r\nif I go away, and try to get the better of this by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw him served with the best of everything\xe2\x80\x94and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nsorry if the best of everything had choked him. The head gardener (Mr.\r\nBegbie) came in at the same time, with his weekly account. The Sergeant\r\ngot on the subject of roses and the merits of grass walks and gravel\r\nwalks immediately. I left the two together, and went out with a heavy\r\nheart. This was the first trouble I remember for many a long year which\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be blown off by a whiff of tobacco, and which was even beyond\r\nthe reach of _Robinson Crusoe_.\r\n\r\nBeing restless and miserable, and having no particular room to go to, I\r\ntook a turn on the terrace, and thought it over in peace and quietness\r\nby myself. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter what my thoughts were. I felt\r\nwretchedly old, and worn out, and unfit for my place\xe2\x80\x94and began to\r\nwonder, for the first time in my life, when it would please God to take\r\nme. With all this, I held firm, notwithstanding, to my belief in Miss\r\nRachel. If Sergeant Cuff had been Solomon in all his glory, and had\r\ntold me that my young lady had mixed herself up in a mean and guilty\r\nplot, I should have had but one answer for Solomon, wise as he was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know her; and I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy meditations were interrupted by Samuel. He brought me a written\r\nmessage from my mistress.\r\n\r\nGoing into the house to get a light to read it by, Samuel remarked that\r\nthere seemed a change coming in the weather. My troubled mind had\r\nprevented me from noticing it before. But, now my attention was roused,\r\nI heard the dogs uneasy, and the wind moaning low. Looking up at the\r\nsky, I saw the rack of clouds getting blacker and blacker, and hurrying\r\nfaster and faster over a watery moon. Wild weather coming\xe2\x80\x94Samuel was\r\nright, wild weather coming.\r\n\r\nThe message from my lady informed me, that the magistrate at\r\nFrizinghall had written to remind her about the three Indians. Early in\r\nthe coming week, the rogues must needs be released, and left free to\r\nfollow their own devices. If we had any more questions to ask them,\r\nthere was no time to lose. Having forgotten to mention this, when she\r\nhad last seen Sergeant Cuff, my mistress now desired me to supply the\r\nomission. The Indians had gone clean out of my head (as they have, no\r\ndoubt, gone clean out of yours). I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see much use in stirring that\r\nsubject again. However, I obeyed my orders on the spot, as a matter of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nI found Sergeant Cuff and the gardener, with a bottle of Scotch whisky\r\nbetween them, head over ears in an argument on the growing of roses.\r\nThe Sergeant was so deeply interested that he held up his hand, and\r\nsigned to me not to interrupt the discussion, when I came in. As far as\r\nI could understand it, the question between them was, whether the white\r\nmoss rose did, or did not, require to be budded on the dog-rose to make\r\nit grow well. Mr. Begbie said, Yes; and Sergeant Cuff said, No. They\r\nappealed to me, as hotly as a couple of boys. Knowing nothing whatever\r\nabout the growing of roses, I steered a middle course\xe2\x80\x94just as her\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s judges do, when the scales of justice bother them by hanging\r\neven to a hair. \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is much to be said on\r\nboth sides.\xe2\x80\x9d In the temporary lull produced by that impartial sentence,\r\nI laid my lady\xe2\x80\x99s written message on the table, under the eyes of\r\nSergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nI had got by this time, as nearly as might be, to hate the Sergeant.\r\nBut truth compels me to acknowledge that, in respect of readiness of\r\nmind, he was a wonderful man.\r\n\r\nIn half a minute after he had read the message, he had looked back into\r\nhis memory for Superintendent Seegrave\xe2\x80\x99s report; had picked out that\r\npart of it in which the Indians were concerned; and was ready with his\r\nanswer. A certain great traveller, who understood the Indians and their\r\nlanguage, had figured in Mr. Seegrave\xe2\x80\x99s report, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Very well.\r\nDid I know the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name and address? Very well again. Would I\r\nwrite them on the back of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s message? Much obliged to me.\r\nSergeant Cuff would look that gentleman up, when he went to Frizinghall\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect anything to come of it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSuperintendent\r\nSeegrave found the Indians as innocent as the babe unborn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuperintendent Seegrave has been proved wrong, up to this time, in all\r\nhis conclusions,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be worth while to find\r\nout tomorrow whether Superintendent Seegrave was wrong about the\r\nIndians as well.\xe2\x80\x9d With that he turned to Mr. Begbie, and took up the\r\nargument again exactly at the place where it had left off. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nquestion between us is a question of soils and seasons, and patience\r\nand pains, Mr. Gardener. Now let me put it to you from another point of\r\nview. You take your white moss rose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy that time, I had closed the door on them, and was out of hearing of\r\nthe rest of the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn the passage, I met Penelope hanging about, and asked what she was\r\nwaiting for.\r\n\r\nShe was waiting for her young lady\xe2\x80\x99s bell, when her young lady chose to\r\ncall her back to go on with the packing for the next day\xe2\x80\x99s journey.\r\nFurther inquiry revealed to me, that Miss Rachel had given it as a\r\nreason for wanting to go to her aunt at Frizinghall, that the house was\r\nunendurable to her, and that she could bear the odious presence of a\r\npoliceman under the same roof with herself no longer. On being\r\ninformed, half an hour since, that her departure would be delayed till\r\ntwo in the afternoon, she had flown into a violent passion. My lady,\r\npresent at the time, had severely rebuked her, and then (having\r\napparently something to say, which was reserved for her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivate ear) had sent Penelope out of the room. My girl was in\r\nwretchedly low spirits about the changed state of things in the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing goes right, father; nothing is like what it used to be. I feel\r\nas if some dreadful misfortune was hanging over us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was my feeling too. But I put a good face on it, before my\r\ndaughter. Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang while we were talking. Penelope ran\r\nup the back stairs to go on with the packing. I went by the other way\r\nto the hall, to see what the glass said about the change in the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nJust as I approached the swing-door leading into the hall from the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 offices, it was violently opened from the other side, and\r\nRosanna Spearman ran by me, with a miserable look of pain in her face,\r\nand one of her hands pressed hard over her heart, as if the pang was in\r\nthat quarter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my girl?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, stopping her. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou ill?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, and\r\ntwisted herself out of my hands, and ran on towards the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstaircase. I called to the cook (who was within hearing) to look after\r\nthe poor girl. Two other persons proved to be within hearing, as well\r\nas the cook. Sergeant Cuff darted softly out of my room, and asked what\r\nwas the matter. I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin, on the other side,\r\npulled open the swing-door, and beckoning me into the hall, inquired if\r\nI had seen anything of Rosanna Spearman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has just passed me, sir, with a very disturbed face, and in a very\r\nodd manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I am innocently the cause of that disturbance,\r\nBetteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, if the girl _is_\r\nconcerned in the loss of the Diamond, I do really believe she was on\r\nthe point of confessing everything\xe2\x80\x94to me, of all the people in the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94not two minutes since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking towards the swing-door, as he said those last words, I fancied\r\nI saw it opened a little way from the inner side.\r\n\r\nWas there anybody listening? The door fell to, before I could get to\r\nit. Looking through, the moment after, I thought I saw the tails of\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s respectable black coat disappearing round the corner of\r\nthe passage. He knew, as well as I did, that he could expect no more\r\nhelp from me, now that I had discovered the turn which his\r\ninvestigations were really taking. Under those circumstances, it was\r\nquite in his character to help himself, and to do it by the underground\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNot feeling sure that I had really seen the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x94and not desiring\r\nto make needless mischief, where, Heaven knows, there was mischief\r\nenough going on already\xe2\x80\x94I told Mr. Franklin that I thought one of the\r\ndogs had got into the house\xe2\x80\x94and then begged him to describe what had\r\nhappened between Rosanna and himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you passing through the hall, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you meet her\r\naccidentally, when she spoke to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin pointed to the billiard-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was knocking the balls about,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand trying to get this\r\nmiserable business of the Diamond out of my mind. I happened to look\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94and there stood Rosanna Spearman at the side of me, like a ghost!\r\nHer stealing on me in that way was so strange, that I hardly knew what\r\nto do at first. Seeing a very anxious expression in her face, I asked\r\nher if she wished to speak to me. She answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, if I dare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nKnowing what suspicion attached to her, I could only put one\r\nconstruction on such language as that. I confess it made me\r\nuncomfortable. I had no wish to invite the girl\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. At the\r\nsame time, in the difficulties that now beset us, I could hardly feel\r\njustified in refusing to listen to her, if she was really bent on\r\nspeaking to me. It was an awkward position; and I dare say I got out of\r\nit awkwardly enough. I said to her, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand you. Is\r\nthere anything you want me to do?\xe2\x80\x99 Mind, Betteredge, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\nunkindly! The poor girl can\xe2\x80\x99t help being ugly\xe2\x80\x94I felt that, at the time.\r\nThe cue was still in my hand, and I went on knocking the balls about,\r\nto take off the awkwardness of the thing. As it turned out, I only made\r\nmatters worse still. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I mortified her without meaning it! She\r\nsuddenly turned away. \xe2\x80\x98He looks at the billiard balls,\xe2\x80\x99 I heard her\r\nsay. \xe2\x80\x98Anything rather than look at _me!_\xe2\x80\x99 Before I could stop her, she\r\nhad left the hall. I am not quite easy about it, Betteredge. Would you\r\nmind telling Rosanna that I meant no unkindness? I have been a little\r\nhard on her, perhaps, in my own thoughts\xe2\x80\x94I have almost hoped that the\r\nloss of the Diamond might be traced to _her_. Not from any ill-will to\r\nthe poor girl: but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped there, and going back to the\r\nbilliard-table, began to knock the balls about once more.\r\n\r\nAfter what had passed between the Sergeant and me, I knew what it was\r\nthat he had left unspoken as well as he knew it himself.\r\n\r\nNothing but the tracing of the Moonstone to our second housemaid could\r\nnow raise Miss Rachel above the infamous suspicion that rested on her\r\nin the mind of Sergeant Cuff. It was no longer a question of quieting\r\nmy young lady\xe2\x80\x99s nervous excitement; it was a question of proving her\r\ninnocence. If Rosanna had done nothing to compromise herself, the hope\r\nwhich Mr. Franklin confessed to having felt would have been hard enough\r\non her in all conscience. But this was not the case. She had pretended\r\nto be ill, and had gone secretly to Frizinghall. She had been up all\r\nnight, making something or destroying something, in private. And she\r\nhad been at the Shivering Sand, that evening, under circumstances which\r\nwere highly suspicious, to say the least of them. For all these reasons\r\n(sorry as I was for Rosanna) I could not but think that Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nway of looking at the matter was neither unnatural nor unreasonable, in\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s position. I said a word to him to that effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in return. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is just a chance\xe2\x80\x94a very poor\r\none, certainly\xe2\x80\x94that Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s conduct may admit of some explanation\r\nwhich we don\xe2\x80\x99t see at present. I hate hurting a woman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings,\r\nBetteredge! Tell the poor creature what I told you to tell her. And if\r\nshe wants to speak to me\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether I get into a scrape or\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94send her to me in the library.\xe2\x80\x9d With those kind words he laid down\r\nthe cue and left me.\r\n\r\nInquiry at the servants\xe2\x80\x99 offices informed me that Rosanna had retired\r\nto her own room. She had declined all offers of assistance with thanks,\r\nand had only asked to be left to rest in quiet. Here, therefore, was an\r\nend of any confession on her part (supposing she really had a\r\nconfession to make) for that night. I reported the result to Mr.\r\nFranklin, who, thereupon, left the library, and went up to bed.\r\n\r\nI was putting the lights out, and making the windows fast, when Samuel\r\ncame in with news of the two guests whom I had left in my room.\r\n\r\nThe argument about the white moss rose had apparently come to an end at\r\nlast. The gardener had gone home, and Sergeant Cuff was nowhere to be\r\nfound in the lower regions of the house.\r\n\r\nI looked into my room. Quite true\xe2\x80\x94nothing was to be discovered there\r\nbut a couple of empty tumblers and a strong smell of hot grog. Had the\r\nSergeant gone of his own accord to the bedchamber that was prepared for\r\nhim? I went upstairs to see.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the second landing, I thought I heard a sound of quiet\r\nand regular breathing on my left-hand side. My left-hand side led to\r\nthe corridor which communicated with Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s room. I looked in,\r\nand there, coiled up on three chairs placed right across the\r\npassage\xe2\x80\x94there, with a red handkerchief tied round his grizzled head,\r\nand his respectable black coat rolled up for a pillow, lay and slept\r\nSergeant Cuff!\r\n\r\nHe woke, instantly and quietly, like a dog, the moment I approached\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd mind, if you ever take to\r\ngrowing roses, the white moss rose is all the better for _not_ being\r\nbudded on the dog-rose, whatever the gardener may say to the contrary!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you not in your proper\r\nbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in my proper bed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I am one\r\nof the many people in this miserable world who can\xe2\x80\x99t earn their money\r\nhonestly and easily at the same time. There was a coincidence, this\r\nevening, between the period of Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s return from the Sands\r\nand the period when Miss Verinder stated her resolution to leave the\r\nhouse. Whatever Rosanna may have hidden, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to my mind that\r\nyour young lady couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go away until she knew that it _was_ hidden.\r\nThe two must have communicated privately once already tonight. If they\r\ntry to communicate again, when the house is quiet, I want to be in the\r\nway, and stop it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me for upsetting your sleeping\r\narrangements, Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94blame the Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to God the Diamond had never found its way into this house!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff looked with a rueful face at the three chairs on which he\r\nhad condemned himself to pass the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gravely.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nNothing happened in the night; and (I am happy to add) no attempt at\r\ncommunication between Miss Rachel and Rosanna rewarded the vigilance of\r\nSergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nI had expected the Sergeant to set off for Frizinghall the first thing\r\nin the morning. He waited about, however, as if he had something else\r\nto do first. I left him to his own devices; and going into the grounds\r\nshortly after, met Mr. Franklin on his favourite walk by the shrubbery\r\nside.\r\n\r\nBefore we had exchanged two words, the Sergeant unexpectedly joined us.\r\nHe made up to Mr. Franklin, who received him, I must own, haughtily\r\nenough. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d was all the return he got for\r\npolitely wishing Mr. Franklin good morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9con the\r\nsubject of the inquiry I am conducting here. You detected the turn that\r\ninquiry was really taking, yesterday. Naturally enough, in your\r\nposition, you are shocked and distressed. Naturally enough, also, you\r\nvisit your own angry sense of your own family scandal upon Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin broke in, sharply enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to remind you, sir, that I have at any rate, thus far, not been\r\n_proved_ to be wrong. Bearing that in mind, be pleased to remember, at\r\nthe same time, that I am an officer of the law acting here under the\r\nsanction of the mistress of the house. Under these circumstances, is\r\nit, or is it not, your duty as a good citizen, to assist me with any\r\nspecial information which you may happen to possess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI possess no special information,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff put that answer by him, as if no answer had been made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may save my time, sir, from being wasted on an inquiry at a\r\ndistance,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif you choose to understand me and speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Franklin; \xe2\x80\x9cand I have nothing to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the female servants (I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention names) spoke to you\r\nprivately, sir, last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr. Franklin cut him short; once more Mr. Franklin answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanding by in silence, I thought of the movement in the swing-door on\r\nthe previous evening, and of the coat-tails which I had seen\r\ndisappearing down the passage. Sergeant Cuff had, no doubt, just heard\r\nenough, before I interrupted him, to make him suspect that Rosanna had\r\nrelieved her mind by confessing something to Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\nThis notion had barely struck me\xe2\x80\x94when who should appear at the end of\r\nthe shrubbery walk but Rosanna Spearman in her own proper person! She\r\nwas followed by Penelope, who was evidently trying to make her retrace\r\nher steps to the house. Seeing that Mr. Franklin was not alone, Rosanna\r\ncame to a standstill, evidently in great perplexity what to do next.\r\nPenelope waited behind her. Mr. Franklin saw the girls as soon as I saw\r\nthem. The Sergeant, with his devilish cunning, took on not to have\r\nnoticed them at all. All this happened in an instant. Before either Mr.\r\nFranklin or I could say a word, Sergeant Cuff struck in smoothly, with\r\nan appearance of continuing the previous conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of harming the girl, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Mr.\r\nFranklin, speaking in a loud voice, so that Rosanna might hear him. \xe2\x80\x9cOn\r\nthe contrary, I recommend you to honour me with your confidence, if you\r\nfeel any interest in Rosanna Spearman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin instantly took on not to have noticed the girls either. He\r\nanswered, speaking loudly on his side:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take no interest whatever in Rosanna Spearman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked towards the end of the walk. All I saw at the distance was\r\nthat Rosanna suddenly turned round, the moment Mr. Franklin had spoken.\r\nInstead of resisting Penelope, as she had done the moment before, she\r\nnow let my daughter take her by the arm and lead her back to the house.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast-bell rang as the two girls disappeared\xe2\x80\x94and even Sergeant\r\nCuff was now obliged to give it up as a bad job! He said to me quietly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go to Frizinghall, Mr. Betteredge; and I shall be back before\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d He went his way without a word more\xe2\x80\x94and for some few hours we\r\nwere well rid of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must make it right with Rosanna,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Franklin said to me, when we\r\nwere alone. \xe2\x80\x9cI seem to be fated to say or do something awkward, before\r\nthat unlucky girl. You must have seen yourself that Sergeant Cuff laid\r\na trap for both of us. If he could confuse _me_, or irritate _her_ into\r\nbreaking out, either she or I might have said something which would\r\nanswer his purpose. On the spur of the moment, I saw no better way out\r\nof it than the way I took. It stopped the girl from saying anything,\r\nand it showed the Sergeant that I saw through him. He was evidently\r\nlistening, Betteredge, when I was speaking to you last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had done worse than listen, as I privately thought to myself. He had\r\nremembered my telling him that the girl was in love with Mr. Franklin;\r\nand he had calculated on _that_, when he appealed to Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in Rosanna\xe2\x80\x94in Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to listening, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked (keeping the other point to myself),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe shall all be rowing in the same boat if this sort of thing goes on\r\nmuch longer. Prying, and peeping, and listening are the natural\r\noccupations of people situated as we are. In another day or two, Mr.\r\nFranklin, we shall all be struck dumb together\xe2\x80\x94for this reason, that we\r\nshall all be listening to surprise each other\xe2\x80\x99s secrets, and all know\r\nit. Excuse my breaking out, sir. The horrid mystery hanging over us in\r\nthis house gets into my head like liquor, and makes me wild. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget what you have told me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first opportunity of making\r\nit right with Rosanna Spearman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t said anything to her yet about last night, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nFranklin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen say nothing now. I had better not invite the girl\xe2\x80\x99s confidence,\r\nwith the Sergeant on the look-out to surprise us together. My conduct\r\nis not very consistent, Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94is it? I see no way out of this\r\nbusiness, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t dreadful to think of, unless the Diamond is\r\ntraced to Rosanna. And yet I can\xe2\x80\x99t, and won\xe2\x80\x99t, help Sergeant Cuff to\r\nfind the girl out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnreasonable enough, no doubt. But it was my state of mind as well. I\r\nthoroughly understood him. If you will, for once in your life, remember\r\nthat you are mortal, perhaps you will thoroughly understand him too.\r\n\r\nThe state of things, indoors and out, while Sergeant Cuff was on his\r\nway to Frizinghall, was briefly this:\r\n\r\nMiss Rachel waited for the time when the carriage was to take her to\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, still obstinately shut up in her own room. My lady and Mr.\r\nFranklin breakfasted together. After breakfast, Mr. Franklin took one\r\nof his sudden resolutions, and went out precipitately to quiet his mind\r\nby a long walk. I was the only person who saw him go; and he told me he\r\nshould be back before the Sergeant returned. The change in the weather,\r\nforeshadowed overnight, had come. Heavy rain had been followed soon\r\nafter dawn, by high wind. It was blowing fresh, as the day got on. But\r\nthough the clouds threatened more than once, the rain still held off.\r\nIt was not a bad day for a walk, if you were young and strong, and\r\ncould breast the great gusts of wind which came sweeping in from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nI attended my lady after breakfast, and assisted her in the settlement\r\nof our household accounts. She only once alluded to the matter of the\r\nMoonstone, and that was in the way of forbidding any present mention of\r\nit between us. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till that man comes back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, meaning the\r\nSergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cWe _must_ speak of it then: we are not obliged to speak of\r\nit now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter leaving my mistress, I found Penelope waiting for me in my room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish, father, you would come and speak to Rosanna,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nvery uneasy about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suspected what was the matter readily enough. But it is a maxim of\r\nmine that men (being superior creatures) are bound to improve women\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthey can. When a woman wants me to do anything (my daughter, or not, it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter), I always insist on knowing why. The oftener you make\r\nthem rummage their own minds for a reason, the more manageable you will\r\nfind them in all the relations of life. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t their fault (poor\r\nwretches!) that they act first and think afterwards; it\xe2\x80\x99s the fault of\r\nthe fools who humour them.\r\n\r\nPenelope\xe2\x80\x99s reason why, on this occasion, may be given in her own words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin has hurt Rosanna\r\ncruelly, without intending it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat took Rosanna into the shrubbery walk?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer own madness,\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope; \xe2\x80\x9cI can call it nothing else. She was\r\nbent on speaking to Mr. Franklin, this morning, come what might of it.\r\nI did my best to stop her; you saw that. If I could only have got her\r\naway before she heard those dreadful words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! there!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your head. I can\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind\r\nthat anything happened to alarm Rosanna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to alarm her, father. But Mr. Franklin said he took no\r\ninterest whatever in her\xe2\x80\x94and, oh, he said it in such a cruel voice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said it to stop the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told her that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Penelope. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you see, father (though Mr.\r\nFranklin isn\xe2\x80\x99t to blame), he\xe2\x80\x99s been mortifying and disappointing her\r\nfor weeks and weeks past; and now this comes on the top of it all! She\r\nhas no right, of course, to expect him to take any interest in her.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite monstrous that she should forget herself and her station in\r\nthat way. But she seems to have lost pride, and proper feeling, and\r\neverything. She frightened me, father, when Mr. Franklin said those\r\nwords. They seemed to turn her into stone. A sudden quiet came over\r\nher, and she has gone about her work, ever since, like a woman in a\r\ndream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to feel a little uneasy. There was something in the way\r\nPenelope put it which silenced my superior sense. I called to mind, now\r\nmy thoughts were directed that way, what had passed between Mr.\r\nFranklin and Rosanna overnight. She looked cut to the heart on that\r\noccasion; and now, as ill-luck would have it, she had been unavoidably\r\nstung again, poor soul, on the tender place. Sad! sad!\xe2\x80\x94all the more sad\r\nbecause the girl had no reason to justify her, and no right to feel it.\r\n\r\nI had promised Mr. Franklin to speak to Rosanna, and this seemed the\r\nfittest time for keeping my word.\r\n\r\nWe found the girl sweeping the corridor outside the bedrooms, pale and\r\ncomposed, and neat as ever in her modest print dress. I noticed a\r\ncurious dimness and dullness in her eyes\xe2\x80\x94not as if she had been crying\r\nbut as if she had been looking at something too long. Possibly, it was\r\na misty something raised by her own thoughts. There was certainly no\r\nobject about her to look at which she had not seen already hundreds on\r\nhundreds of times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, Rosanna!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t fret over your own fancies. I\r\nhave got something to say to you from Mr. Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thereupon put the matter in the right view before her, in the\r\nfriendliest and most comforting words I could find. My principles, in\r\nregard to the other sex, are, as you may have noticed, very severe. But\r\nsomehow or other, when I come face to face with the women, my practice\r\n(I own) is not conformable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin is very kind and considerate. Please to thank him.\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\nwas all the answer she made me.\r\n\r\nMy daughter had already noticed that Rosanna went about her work like a\r\nwoman in a dream. I now added to this observation, that she also\r\nlistened and spoke like a woman in a dream. I doubted if her mind was\r\nin a fit condition to take in what I had said to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure, Rosanna, that you understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe echoed me, not like a living woman, but like a creature moved by\r\nmachinery. She went on sweeping all the time. I took away the broom as\r\ngently and as kindly as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my girl!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not like yourself. You have got\r\nsomething on your mind. I\xe2\x80\x99m your friend\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand your friend,\r\neven if you have done wrong. Make a clean breast of it, Rosanna\xe2\x80\x94make a\r\nclean breast of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time had been, when my speaking to her in that way would have\r\nbrought the tears into her eyes. I could see no change in them now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make a clean breast of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my lady?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mr. Franklin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; to Mr. Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hardly knew what to say to that. She was in no condition to\r\nunderstand the caution against speaking to him in private, which Mr.\r\nFranklin had directed me to give her. Feeling my way, little by little,\r\nI only told her Mr. Franklin had gone out for a walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t trouble Mr. Franklin,\r\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not speak to my lady?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way to relieve your mind is to\r\nspeak to the merciful and Christian mistress who has always been kind\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me for a moment with a grave and steady attention, as if\r\nshe was fixing what I said in her mind. Then she took the broom out of\r\nmy hands and moved off with it slowly, a little way down the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going on with her sweeping, and speaking to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow a better way of relieving my mind than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to let me go on with my work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPenelope followed her, and offered to help her.\r\n\r\nShe answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I want to do my work. Thank you, Penelope.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked round at me. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Betteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no moving her\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing more to be said. I signed to\r\nPenelope to come away with me. We left her, as we had found her,\r\nsweeping the corridor, like a woman in a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a matter for the doctor to look into,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beyond\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy daughter reminded me of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s illness, owing (as you may\r\nremember) to the chill he had caught on the night of the dinner-party.\r\nHis assistant\xe2\x80\x94a certain Mr. Ezra Jennings\xe2\x80\x94was at our disposal, to be\r\nsure. But nobody knew much about him in our parts. He had been engaged\r\nby Mr. Candy under rather peculiar circumstances; and, right or wrong,\r\nwe none of us liked him or trusted him. There were other doctors at\r\nFrizinghall. But they were strangers to our house; and Penelope\r\ndoubted, in Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s present state, whether strangers might not do her\r\nmore harm than good.\r\n\r\nI thought of speaking to my lady. But, remembering the heavy weight of\r\nanxiety which she already had on her mind, I hesitated to add to all\r\nthe other vexations this new trouble. Still, there was a necessity for\r\ndoing something. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s state was, to my thinking, downright\r\nalarming\xe2\x80\x94and my mistress ought to be informed of it. Unwilling enough,\r\nI went to her sitting-room. No one was there. My lady was shut up with\r\nMiss Rachel. It was impossible for me to see her till she came out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI waited in vain till the clock on the front staircase struck the\r\nquarter to two. Five minutes afterwards, I heard my name called, from\r\nthe drive outside the house. I knew the voice directly. Sergeant Cuff\r\nhad returned from Frizinghall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGoing down to the front door, I met the Sergeant on the steps.\r\n\r\nIt went against the grain with me, after what had passed between us, to\r\nshow him that I felt any sort of interest in his proceedings. In spite\r\nof myself, however, I felt an interest that there was no resisting. My\r\nsense of dignity sank from under me, and out came the words: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat news\r\nfrom Frizinghall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have found\r\nout what Rosanna bought privately in the town, on Thursday last. The\r\nIndians will be set free on Wednesday in next week. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a doubt\r\non my mind, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a doubt on Mr. Murthwaite\xe2\x80\x99s mind, that they\r\ncame to this place to steal the Moonstone. Their calculations were all\r\nthrown out, of course, by what happened in the house on Wednesday\r\nnight; and they have no more to do with the actual loss of the jewel\r\nthan you have. But I can tell you one thing, Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94if _we_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t find the Moonstone, _they_ will. You have not heard the last of\r\nthe three jugglers yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin came back from his walk as the Sergeant said those\r\nstartling words. Governing his curiosity better than I had governed\r\nmine, he passed us without a word, and went on into the house.\r\n\r\nAs for me, having already dropped my dignity, I determined to have the\r\nwhole benefit of the sacrifice. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much for the Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Rosanna next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mystery in that quarter is thicker than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\ntraced her to a shop at Frizinghall, kept by a linen draper named\r\nMaltby. She bought nothing whatever at any of the other drapers\xe2\x80\x99 shops,\r\nor at any milliners\xe2\x80\x99 or tailors\xe2\x80\x99 shops; and she bought nothing at\r\nMaltby\xe2\x80\x99s but a piece of long cloth. She was very particular in choosing\r\na certain quality. As to quantity, she bought enough to make a\r\nnightgown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose nightgown?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer own, to be sure. Between twelve and three, on the Thursday\r\nmorning, she must have slipped down to your young lady\xe2\x80\x99s room, to\r\nsettle the hiding of the Moonstone while all the rest of you were in\r\nbed. In going back to her own room, her nightgown must have brushed the\r\nwet paint on the door. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wash out the stain; and she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t safely destroy the night-gown without first providing another\r\nlike it, to make the inventory of her linen complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proves that it was Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s nightgown?\xe2\x80\x9d I objected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe material she bought for making the substitute dress,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nSergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s nightgown, she would have had\r\nto buy lace, and frilling, and Lord knows what besides; and she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had time to make it in one night. Plain long cloth means\r\na plain servant\xe2\x80\x99s nightgown. No, no, Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94all that is clear\r\nenough. The pinch of the question is\xe2\x80\x94why, after having provided the\r\nsubstitute dress, does she hide the smeared nightgown, instead of\r\ndestroying it? If the girl won\xe2\x80\x99t speak out, there is only one way of\r\nsettling the difficulty. The hiding-place at the Shivering Sand must be\r\nsearched\xe2\x80\x94and the true state of the case will be discovered there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to find the place?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to disappoint you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s a secret\r\nwhich I mean to keep to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Not to irritate your curiosity, as he irritated mine, I may here\r\ninform you that he had come back from Frizinghall provided with a\r\nsearch-warrant. His experience in such matters told him that Rosanna\r\nwas in all probability carrying about her a memorandum of the\r\nhiding-place, to guide her, in case she returned to it, under changed\r\ncircumstances and after a lapse of time. Possessed of this memorandum,\r\nthe Sergeant would be furnished with all that he could desire.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose we drop speculation, and\r\nget to business. I told Joyce to have an eye on Rosanna. Where is\r\nJoyce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoyce was the Frizinghall policeman, who had been left by\r\nSuperintendent Seegrave at Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s disposal. The clock struck\r\ntwo, as he put the question; and, punctual to the moment, the carriage\r\ncame round to take Miss Rachel to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, stopping me as I was about to\r\nsend in search of Joyce. \xe2\x80\x9cI must attend to Miss Verinder first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the rain was still threatening, it was the close carriage that had\r\nbeen appointed to take Miss Rachel to Frizinghall. Sergeant Cuff\r\nbeckoned Samuel to come down to him from the rumble behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see a friend of mine waiting among the trees, on this side of\r\nthe lodge gate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, without stopping the carriage,\r\nwill get up into the rumble with you. You have nothing to do but to\r\nhold your tongue, and shut your eyes. Otherwise, you will get into\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that advice, he sent the footman back to his place. What Samuel\r\nthought I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It was plain, to my mind, that Miss Rachel was to\r\nbe privately kept in view from the time when she left our house\xe2\x80\x94if she\r\ndid leave it. A watch set on my young lady! A spy behind her in the\r\nrumble of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s carriage! I could have cut my own tongue out for\r\nhaving forgotten myself so far as to speak to Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nThe first person to come out of the house was my lady. She stood aside,\r\non the top step, posting herself there to see what happened. Not a word\r\ndid she say, either to the Sergeant or to me. With her lips closed, and\r\nher arms folded in the light garden cloak which she had wrapped round\r\nher on coming into the air, there she stood, as still as a statue,\r\nwaiting for her daughter to appear.\r\n\r\nIn a minute more, Miss Rachel came downstairs\xe2\x80\x94very nicely dressed in\r\nsome soft yellow stuff, that set off her dark complexion, and clipped\r\nher tight (in the form of a jacket) round the waist. She had a smart\r\nlittle straw hat on her head, with a white veil twisted round it. She\r\nhad primrose-coloured gloves that fitted her hands like a second skin.\r\nHer beautiful black hair looked as smooth as satin under her hat. Her\r\nlittle ears were like rosy shells\xe2\x80\x94they had a pearl dangling from each\r\nof them. She came swiftly out to us, as straight as a lily on its stem,\r\nand as lithe and supple in every movement she made as a young cat.\r\nNothing that I could discover was altered in her pretty face, but her\r\neyes and her lips. Her eyes were brighter and fiercer than I liked to\r\nsee; and her lips had so completely lost their colour and their smile\r\nthat I hardly knew them again. She kissed her mother in a hasty and\r\nsudden manner on the cheek. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cTry to forgive me, mamma\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen pulled down her veil over her face so vehemently that she tore it.\r\nIn another moment she had run down the steps, and had rushed into the\r\ncarriage as if it was a hiding-place.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff was just as quick on his side. He put Samuel back, and\r\nstood before Miss Rachel, with the open carriage-door in his hand, at\r\nthe instant when she settled herself in her place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d says Miss Rachel, from behind her veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to say one word to you, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\r\nyou go. I can\xe2\x80\x99t presume to stop your paying a visit to your aunt. I can\r\nonly venture to say that your leaving us, as things are now, puts an\r\nobstacle in the way of my recovering your Diamond. Please to understand\r\nthat; and now decide for yourself whether you go or stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Rachel never even answered him. \xe2\x80\x9cDrive on, James!\xe2\x80\x9d she called out\r\nto the coachman.\r\n\r\nWithout another word, the Sergeant shut the carriage-door. Just as he\r\nclosed it, Mr. Franklin came running down the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\r\nRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Rachel, louder than ever, and taking no more\r\nnotice of Mr. Franklin than she had taken of Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin stepped back thunderstruck, as well he might be. The\r\ncoachman, not knowing what to do, looked towards my lady, still\r\nstanding immovable on the top step. My lady, with anger and sorrow and\r\nshame all struggling together in her face, made him a sign to start the\r\nhorses, and then turned back hastily into the house. Mr. Franklin,\r\nrecovering the use of his speech, called after her, as the carriage\r\ndrove off, \xe2\x80\x9cAunt! you were quite right. Accept my thanks for all your\r\nkindness\xe2\x80\x94and let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady turned as though to speak to him. Then, as if distrusting\r\nherself, waved her hand kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see you, before you leave us,\r\nFranklin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a broken voice\xe2\x80\x94and went on to her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo me a last favour, Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, turning to me,\r\nwith the tears in his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cGet me away to the train as soon as you\r\ncan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe too went his way into the house. For the moment, Miss Rachel had\r\ncompletely unmanned him. Judge from that, how fond he must have been of\r\nher!\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff and I were left face to face, at the bottom of the steps.\r\nThe Sergeant stood with his face set towards a gap in the trees,\r\ncommanding a view of one of the windings of the drive which led from\r\nthe house. He had his hands in his pockets, and he was softly whistling\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Rose of Summer\xe2\x80\x9d to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a time for everything,\xe2\x80\x9d I said savagely enough. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ntime for whistling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the carriage appeared in the distance, through the gap,\r\non its way to the lodge-gate. There was another man, besides Samuel,\r\nplainly visible in the rumble behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant to himself. He turned round to me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno time for whistling, Mr. Betteredge, as you say. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to take\r\nthis business in hand, now, without sparing anybody. We\xe2\x80\x99ll begin with\r\nRosanna Spearman. Where is Joyce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe both called for Joyce, and received no answer. I sent one of the\r\nstable-boys to look for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard what I said to Miss Verinder?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Sergeant, while\r\nwe were waiting. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you saw how she received it? I tell her plainly\r\nthat her leaving us will be an obstacle in the way of my recovering her\r\nDiamond\xe2\x80\x94and she leaves, in the face of that statement! Your young lady\r\nhas got a travelling companion in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, Mr.\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x94and the name of it is, the Moonstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said nothing. I only held on like death to my belief in Miss Rachel.\r\n\r\nThe stable-boy came back, followed\xe2\x80\x94very unwillingly, as it appeared to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94by Joyce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Rosanna Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t account for it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Joyce began; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am very sorry. But\r\nsomehow or other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I went to Frizinghall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, cutting him short,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you to keep your eyes on Rosanna Spearman, without allowing her\r\nto discover that she was being watched. Do you mean to tell me that you\r\nhave let her give you the slip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says Joyce, beginning to tremble, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I was\r\nperhaps a little _too_ careful not to let her discover me. There are\r\nsuch a many passages in the lower parts of this house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it since you missed her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNigh on an hour since, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go back to your regular business at Frizinghall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant, speaking just as composedly as ever, in his usual quiet and\r\ndreary way. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think your talents are at all in our line, Mr.\r\nJoyce. Your present form of employment is a trifle beyond you. Good\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man slunk off. I find it very difficult to describe how I was\r\naffected by the discovery that Rosanna Spearman was missing. I seemed\r\nto be in fifty different minds about it, all at the same time. In that\r\nstate, I stood staring at Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x94and my powers of language quite\r\nfailed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, as if he had discovered the\r\nuppermost thought in me, and was picking it out to be answered, before\r\nall the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cYour young friend, Rosanna, won\xe2\x80\x99t slip through my\r\nfingers so easy as you think. As long as I know where Miss Verinder is,\r\nI have the means at my disposal of tracing Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s accomplice.\r\nI prevented them from communicating last night. Very good. They will\r\nget together at Frizinghall, instead of getting together here. The\r\npresent inquiry must be simply shifted (rather sooner than I had\r\nanticipated) from this house, to the house at which Miss Verinder is\r\nvisiting. In the meantime, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I must trouble you to call the\r\nservants together again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went round with him to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall. It is very disgraceful,\r\nbut it is not the less true, that I had another attack of the\r\ndetective-fever, when he said those last words. I forgot that I hated\r\nSergeant Cuff. I seized him confidentially by the arm. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\ngoodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, tell us what you are going to do with the servants\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great Cuff stood stock-still, and addressed himself in a kind of\r\nmelancholy rapture to the empty air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant (apparently meaning me), \xe2\x80\x9conly\r\nunderstood the growing of roses he would be the most completely perfect\r\ncharacter on the face of creation!\xe2\x80\x9d After that strong expression of\r\nfeeling, he sighed, and put his arm through mine. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how it\r\nstands,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dropping down again to business. \xe2\x80\x9cRosanna has done\r\none of two things. She has either gone direct to Frizinghall (before I\r\ncan get there), or she has gone first to visit her hiding-place at the\r\nShivering Sand. The first thing to find out is, which of the servants\r\nsaw the last of her before she left the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn instituting this inquiry, it turned out that the last person who had\r\nset eyes on Rosanna was Nancy, the kitchenmaid.\r\n\r\nNancy had seen her slip out with a letter in her hand, and stop the\r\nbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s man who had just been delivering some meat at the back door.\r\nNancy had heard her ask the man to post the letter when he got back to\r\nFrizinghall. The man had looked at the address, and had said it was a\r\nroundabout way of delivering a letter directed to Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, to post\r\nit at Frizinghall\xe2\x80\x94and that, moreover, on a Saturday, which would\r\nprevent the letter from getting to its destination until Monday\r\nmorning, Rosanna had answered that the delivery of the letter being\r\ndelayed till Monday was of no importance. The only thing she wished to\r\nbe sure of was that the man would do what she told him. The man had\r\npromised to do it, and had driven away. Nancy had been called back to\r\nher work in the kitchen. And no other person had seen anything\r\nafterwards of Rosanna Spearman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, when we were alone again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go to Frizinghall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the letter, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The memorandum of the hiding-place is in that letter. I must see\r\nthe address at the post-office. If it is the address I suspect, I shall\r\npay our friend, Mrs. Yolland, another visit on Monday next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went with the Sergeant to order the pony-chaise. In the stable-yard\r\nwe got a new light thrown on the missing girl.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nThe news of Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance had, as it appeared, spread among\r\nthe out-of-door servants. They too had made their inquiries; and they\r\nhad just laid hands on a quick little imp, nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cDuffy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94who was\r\noccasionally employed in weeding the garden, and who had seen Rosanna\r\nSpearman as lately as half-an-hour since. Duffy was certain that the\r\ngirl had passed him in the fir-plantation, not walking, but _running_,\r\nin the direction of the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes this boy know the coast hereabouts?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been born and bred on the coast,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuffy!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want to earn a shilling? If you do,\r\ncome along with me. Keep the pony-chaise ready, Mr. Betteredge, till I\r\ncome back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started for the Shivering Sand, at a rate that my legs (though well\r\nenough preserved for my time of life) had no hope of matching. Little\r\nDuffy, as the way is with the young savages in our parts when they are\r\nin high spirits, gave a howl, and trotted off at the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s heels.\r\n\r\nHere again, I find it impossible to give anything like a clear account\r\nof the state of my mind in the interval after Sergeant Cuff had left\r\nus. A curious and stupefying restlessness got possession of me. I did a\r\ndozen different needless things in and out of the house, not one of\r\nwhich I can now remember. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how long it was after the\r\nSergeant had gone to the sands, when Duffy came running back with a\r\nmessage for me. Sergeant Cuff had given the boy a leaf torn out of his\r\npocket-book, on which was written in pencil, \xe2\x80\x9cSend me one of Rosanna\r\nSpearman\xe2\x80\x99s boots, and be quick about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI despatched the first woman-servant I could find to Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s room;\r\nand I sent the boy back to say that I myself would follow him with the\r\nboot.\r\n\r\nThis, I am well aware, was not the quickest way to take of obeying the\r\ndirections which I had received. But I was resolved to see for myself\r\nwhat new mystification was going on before I trusted Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s boot in\r\nthe Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s hands. My old notion of screening the girl, if I could,\r\nseemed to have come back on me again, at the eleventh hour. This state\r\nof feeling (to say nothing of the detective-fever) hurried me off, as\r\nsoon as I had got the boot, at the nearest approach to a run which a\r\nman turned seventy can reasonably hope to make.\r\n\r\nAs I got near the shore, the clouds gathered black, and the rain came\r\ndown, drifting in great white sheets of water before the wind. I heard\r\nthe thunder of the sea on the sand-bank at the mouth of the bay. A\r\nlittle further on, I passed the boy crouching for shelter under the lee\r\nof the sandhills. Then I saw the raging sea, and the rollers tumbling\r\nin on the sand-bank, and the driven rain sweeping over the waters like\r\na flying garment, and the yellow wilderness of the beach with one\r\nsolitary black figure standing on it\xe2\x80\x94the figure of Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand towards the north, when he first saw me. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep on\r\nthat side!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd come on down here to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went down to him, choking for breath, with my heart leaping as if it\r\nwas like to leap out of me. I was past speaking. I had a hundred\r\nquestions to put to him; and not one of them would pass my lips. His\r\nface frightened me. I saw a look in his eyes which was a look of\r\nhorror. He snatched the boot out of my hand, and set it in a footmark\r\non the sand, bearing south from us as we stood, and pointing straight\r\ntowards the rocky ledge called the South Spit. The mark was not yet\r\nblurred out by the rain\xe2\x80\x94and the girl\xe2\x80\x99s boot fitted it to a hair.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant pointed to the boot in the footmark, without saying a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nI caught at his arm, and tried to speak to him, and failed as I had\r\nfailed when I tried before. He went on, following the footsteps down\r\nand down to where the rocks and the sand joined. The South Spit was\r\njust awash with the flowing tide; the waters heaved over the hidden\r\nface of the Shivering Sand. Now this way and now that, with an\r\nobstinate patience that was dreadful to see, Sergeant Cuff tried the\r\nboot in the footsteps, and always found it pointing the same\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94straight _to_ the rocks. Hunt as he might, no sign could he find\r\nanywhere of the footsteps walking _from_ them.\r\n\r\nHe gave it up at last. Still keeping silence, he looked again at me;\r\nand then he looked out at the waters before us, heaving in deeper and\r\ndeeper over the quicksand. I looked where he looked\xe2\x80\x94and I saw his\r\nthought in his face. A dreadful dumb trembling crawled all over me on a\r\nsudden. I fell upon my knees on the beach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been back at the hiding-place,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard the Sergeant say to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cSome fatal accident has happened to her on those rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s altered looks, and words, and actions\xe2\x80\x94the numbed, deadened\r\nway in which she listened to me, and spoke to me\xe2\x80\x94when I had found her\r\nsweeping the corridor but a few hours since, rose up in my mind, and\r\nwarned me, even as the Sergeant spoke, that his guess was wide of the\r\ndreadful truth. I tried to tell him of the fear that had frozen me up.\r\nI tried to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThe death she has died, Sergeant, was a death of her\r\nown seeking.\xe2\x80\x9d No! the words wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come. The dumb trembling held me\r\nin its grip. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the driving rain. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the\r\nrising tide. As in the vision of a dream, the poor lost creature came\r\nback before me. I saw her again as I had seen her in the past time\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nthe morning when I went to fetch her into the house. I heard her again,\r\ntelling me that the Shivering Sand seemed to draw her to it against her\r\nwill, and wondering whether her grave was waiting for her _there_. The\r\nhorror of it struck at me, in some unfathomable way, through my own\r\nchild. My girl was just her age. My girl, tried as Rosanna was tried,\r\nmight have lived that miserable life, and died this dreadful death.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant kindly lifted me up, and turned me away from the sight of\r\nthe place where she had perished.\r\n\r\nWith that relief, I began to fetch my breath again, and to see things\r\nabout me, as things really were. Looking towards the sandhills, I saw\r\nthe men-servants from out-of-doors, and the fisherman, named Yolland,\r\nall running down to us together; and all, having taken the alarm,\r\ncalling out to know if the girl had been found. In the fewest words,\r\nthe Sergeant showed them the evidence of the footmarks, and told them\r\nthat a fatal accident must have happened to her. He then picked out the\r\nfisherman from the rest, and put a question to him, turning about again\r\ntowards the sea: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCould a boat have taken her off,\r\nin such weather as this, from those rocks where her footmarks stop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fisherman pointed to the rollers tumbling in on the sand-bank, and\r\nto the great waves leaping up in clouds of foam against the headlands\r\non either side of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo boat that ever was built,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9ccould have got to her\r\nthrough _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff looked for the last time at the foot-marks on the sand,\r\nwhich the rain was now fast blurring out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the evidence that she can\xe2\x80\x99t have left this place\r\nby land. And here,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, looking at the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x9cis the\r\nevidence that she can\xe2\x80\x99t have got away by sea.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and\r\nconsidered for a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was seen running towards this place, half\r\nan hour before I got here from the house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cSome\r\ntime has passed since then. Call it, altogether, an hour ago. How high\r\nwould the water be, at that time, on this side of the rocks?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npointed to the south side\xe2\x80\x94otherwise, the side which was not filled up\r\nby the quicksand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the tide makes today,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x9cthere wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen water enough to drown a kitten on that side of the Spit, an hour\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff turned about northward, towards the quicksand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much on this side?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess still,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Yolland. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shivering Sand would have been\r\njust awash, and no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant turned to me, and said that the accident must have\r\nhappened on the side of the quicksand. My tongue was loosened at that.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo accident!\xe2\x80\x9d I told him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she came to this place, she came weary\r\nof her life, to end it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started back from me. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. The rest of them\r\ncrowded round. The Sergeant recovered himself instantly. He put them\r\nback from me; he said I was an old man; he said the discovery had\r\nshaken me; he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone a little.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned to\r\nYolland, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any chance of finding her, when the tide\r\nebbs again?\xe2\x80\x9d And Yolland answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNone. What the Sand gets, the Sand\r\nkeeps for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d Having said that, the fisherman came a step nearer,\r\nand addressed himself to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a word to say to you about the young\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s death. Four foot out, broadwise, along the side of the Spit,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a shelf of rock, about half fathom down under the sand. My\r\nquestion is\xe2\x80\x94why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she strike that? If she slipped, by accident,\r\nfrom off the Spit, she fell in where there\xe2\x80\x99s foothold at the bottom, at\r\na depth that would barely cover her to the waist. She must have waded\r\nout, or jumped out, into the Deeps beyond\xe2\x80\x94or she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be missing\r\nnow. No accident, sir! The Deeps of the Quicksand have got her. And\r\nthey have got her by her own act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that testimony from a man whose knowledge was to be relied on,\r\nthe Sergeant was silent. The rest of us, like him, held our peace. With\r\none accord, we all turned back up the slope of the beach.\r\n\r\nAt the sandhillocks we were met by the under-groom, running to us from\r\nthe house. The lad is a good lad, and has an honest respect for me. He\r\nhanded me a little note, with a decent sorrow in his face. \xe2\x80\x9cPenelope\r\nsent me with this, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe found it in Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was her last farewell word to the old man who had done his\r\nbest\xe2\x80\x94thank God, always done his best\xe2\x80\x94to befriend her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have often forgiven me, Mr. Betteredge, in past times. When you\r\nnext see the Shivering Sand, try to forgive me once more. I have found\r\nmy grave where my grave was waiting for me. I have lived, and died,\r\nsir, grateful for your kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no more than that. Little as it was, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t manhood enough\r\nto hold up against it. Your tears come easy, when you\xe2\x80\x99re young, and\r\nbeginning the world. Your tears come easy, when you\xe2\x80\x99re old, and leaving\r\nit. I burst out crying.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff took a step nearer to me\xe2\x80\x94meaning kindly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt. I\r\nshrank back from him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the dread of you,\r\nthat has driven her to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there will\r\nbe time enough to speak of it when we are indoors again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed the rest of them, with the help of the groom\xe2\x80\x99s arm. Through\r\nthe driving rain we went back\xe2\x80\x94to meet the trouble and the terror that\r\nwere waiting for us at the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nThose in front had spread the news before us. We found the servants in\r\na state of panic. As we passed my lady\xe2\x80\x99s door, it was thrown open\r\nviolently from the inner side. My mistress came out among us (with Mr.\r\nFranklin following, and trying vainly to compose her), quite beside\r\nherself with the horror of the thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are answerable for this!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, threatening the Sergeant\r\nwildly with her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cGabriel! give that wretch his money\xe2\x80\x94and release\r\nme from the sight of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant was the only one among us who was fit to cope with\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94being the only one among us who was in possession of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no more answerable for this distressing calamity, my lady, than\r\nyou are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf, in half an hour from this, you still insist on\r\nmy leaving the house, I will accept your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, but not\r\nyour ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was spoken very respectfully, but very firmly at the same time\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit had its effect on my mistress as well as on me. She suffered Mr.\r\nFranklin to lead her back into the room. As the door closed on the two,\r\nthe Sergeant, looking about among the women-servants in his observant\r\nway, noticed that while all the rest were merely frightened, Penelope\r\nwas in tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your father has changed his wet clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nto her, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and speak to us, in your father\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the half-hour was out, I had got my dry clothes on, and had lent\r\nSergeant Cuff such change of dress as he required. Penelope came in to\r\nus to hear what the Sergeant wanted with her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever felt\r\nwhat a good dutiful daughter I had, so strongly as I felt it at that\r\nmoment. I took her and sat her on my knee and I prayed God bless her.\r\nShe hid her head on my bosom, and put her arms round my neck\xe2\x80\x94and we\r\nwaited a little while in silence. The poor dead girl must have been at\r\nthe bottom of it, I think, with my daughter and with me. The Sergeant\r\nwent to the window, and stood there looking out. I thought it right to\r\nthank him for considering us both in this way\xe2\x80\x94and I did.\r\n\r\nPeople in high life have all the luxuries to themselves\xe2\x80\x94among others,\r\nthe luxury of indulging their feelings. People in low life have no such\r\nprivilege. Necessity, which spares our betters, has no pity on _us_. We\r\nlearn to put our feelings back into ourselves, and to jog on with our\r\nduties as patiently as may be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of this\xe2\x80\x94I only notice\r\nit. Penelope and I were ready for the Sergeant, as soon as the Sergeant\r\nwas ready on his side. Asked if she knew what had led her\r\nfellow-servant to destroy herself, my daughter answered (as you will\r\nforesee) that it was for love of Mr. Franklin Blake. Asked next, if she\r\nhad mentioned this notion of hers to any other person, Penelope\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not mentioned it, for Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d I felt it\r\nnecessary to add a word to this. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nmy dear, as well. If Rosanna _has_ died for love of him, it is not with\r\nhis knowledge or by his fault. Let him leave the house today, if he\r\ndoes leave it, without the useless pain of knowing the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Sergeant\r\nCuff said, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d and fell silent again; comparing Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotion (as it seemed to me) with some other notion of his own which he\r\nkept to himself.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the half-hour, my mistress\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang.\r\n\r\nOn my way to answer it, I met Mr. Franklin coming out of his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting-room. He mentioned that her ladyship was ready to see Sergeant\r\nCuff\xe2\x80\x94in my presence as before\xe2\x80\x94and he added that he himself wanted to\r\nsay two words to the Sergeant first. On our way back to my room, he\r\nstopped, and looked at the railway time-table in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really going to leave us, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Rachel will\r\nsurely come right again, if you only give her time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will come right again,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Franklin, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she hears\r\nthat I have gone away, and that she will see me no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought he spoke in resentment of my young lady\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of him.\r\nBut it was not so. My mistress had noticed, from the time when the\r\npolice first came into the house, that the bare mention of him was\r\nenough to set Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s temper in a flame. He had been too fond of\r\nhis cousin to like to confess this to himself, until the truth had been\r\nforced on him, when she drove off to her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s. His eyes once opened\r\nin that cruel way which you know of, Mr. Franklin had taken his\r\nresolution\xe2\x80\x94the one resolution which a man of any spirit _could_ take\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nleave the house.\r\n\r\nWhat he had to say to the Sergeant was spoken in my presence. He\r\ndescribed her ladyship as willing to acknowledge that she had spoken\r\nover-hastily. And he asked if Sergeant Cuff would consent\xe2\x80\x94in that\r\ncase\xe2\x80\x94to accept his fee, and to leave the matter of the Diamond where\r\nthe matter stood now. The Sergeant answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. My fee is paid\r\nme for doing my duty. I decline to take it, until my duty is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll explain myself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came here, I\r\nundertook to throw the necessary light on the matter of the missing\r\nDiamond. I am now ready, and waiting to redeem my pledge. When I have\r\nstated the case to Lady Verinder as the case now stands, and when I\r\nhave told her plainly what course of action to take for the recovery of\r\nthe Moonstone, the responsibility will be off my shoulders. Let her\r\nladyship decide, after that, whether she does, or does not, allow me to\r\ngo on. I shall then have done what I undertook to do\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my\r\nfee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those words Sergeant Cuff reminded us that, even in the Detective\r\nPolice, a man may have a reputation to lose.\r\n\r\nThe view he took was so plainly the right one, that there was no more\r\nto be said. As I rose to conduct him to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s room, he asked if Mr.\r\nFranklin wished to be present. Mr. Franklin answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNot unless Lady\r\nVerinder desires it.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, in a whisper to me, as I was following\r\nthe Sergeant out, \xe2\x80\x9cI know what that man is going to say about Rachel;\r\nand I am too fond of her to hear it, and keep my temper. Leave me by\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left him, miserable enough, leaning on the sill of my window, with\r\nhis face hidden in his hands and Penelope peeping through the door,\r\nlonging to comfort him. In Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s place, I should have called\r\nher in. When you are ill-used by one woman, there is great comfort in\r\ntelling it to another\xe2\x80\x94because, nine times out of ten, the other always\r\ntakes your side. Perhaps, when my back was turned, he did call her in?\r\nIn that case it is only doing my daughter justice to declare that she\r\nwould stick at nothing, in the way of comforting Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Sergeant Cuff and I proceeded to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nAt the last conference we had held with her, we had found her not over\r\nwilling to lift her eyes from the book which she had on the table. On\r\nthis occasion there was a change for the better. She met the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye with an eye that was as steady as his own. The family spirit showed\r\nitself in every line of her face; and I knew that Sergeant Cuff would\r\nmeet his match, when a woman like my mistress was strung up to hear the\r\nworst he could say to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nThe first words, when we had taken our seats, were spoken by my lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Cuff,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere was perhaps some excuse for the\r\ninconsiderate manner in which I spoke to you half an hour since. I have\r\nno wish, however, to claim that excuse. I say, with perfect sincerity,\r\nthat I regret it, if I wronged you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grace of voice and manner with which she made him that atonement\r\nhad its due effect on the Sergeant. He requested permission to justify\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94putting his justification as an act of respect to my mistress.\r\nIt was impossible, he said, that he could be in any way responsible for\r\nthe calamity, which had shocked us all, for this sufficient reason,\r\nthat his success in bringing his inquiry to its proper end depended on\r\nhis neither saying nor doing anything that could alarm Rosanna\r\nSpearman. He appealed to me to testify whether he had, or had not,\r\ncarried that object out. I could, and did, bear witness that he had.\r\nAnd there, as I thought, the matter might have been judiciously left to\r\ncome to an end.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff, however, took it a step further, evidently (as you shall\r\nnow judge) with the purpose of forcing the most painful of all possible\r\nexplanations to take place between her ladyship and himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard a motive assigned for the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich may possibly be the right one. It is a motive\r\nquite unconnected with the case which I am conducting here. I am bound\r\nto add, however, that my own opinion points the other way. Some\r\nunbearable anxiety in connexion with the missing Diamond, has, I\r\nbelieve, driven the poor creature to her own destruction. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npretend to know what that unbearable anxiety may have been. But I think\r\n(with your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s permission) I can lay my hand on a person who is\r\ncapable of deciding whether I am right or wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the person now in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d my mistress asked, after waiting a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person has left the house, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat answer pointed as straight to Miss Rachel as straight could be. A\r\nsilence dropped on us which I thought would never come to an end. Lord!\r\nhow the wind howled, and how the rain drove at the window, as I sat\r\nthere waiting for one or other of them to speak again!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to express yourself plainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nrefer to my daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, in so many words.\r\n\r\nMy mistress had her cheque-book on the table when we entered the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94no doubt to pay the Sergeant his fee. She now put it back in the\r\ndrawer. It went to my heart to see how her poor hand trembled\xe2\x80\x94the hand\r\nthat had loaded her old servant with benefits; the hand that, I pray\r\nGod, may take mine, when my time comes, and I leave my place for ever!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped,\xe2\x80\x9d said my lady, very slowly and quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cto have\r\nrecompensed your services, and to have parted with you without Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s name having been openly mentioned between us as it has been\r\nmentioned now. My nephew has probably said something of this, before\r\nyou came into my room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blake gave his message, my lady. And I gave Mr. Blake a reason\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is needless to tell me your reason. After what you have just said,\r\nyou know as well as I do that you have gone too far to go back. I owe\r\nit to myself, and I owe it to my child, to insist on your remaining\r\nhere, and to insist on your speaking out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there had been time, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have\r\npreferred writing my report, instead of communicating it by word of\r\nmouth. But, if this inquiry is to go on, time is of too much importance\r\nto be wasted in writing. I am ready to go into the matter at once. It\r\nis a very painful matter for me to speak of, and for you to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere my mistress stopped him once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may possibly make it less painful to you, and to my good servant and\r\nfriend here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I set the example of speaking boldly, on my\r\nside. You suspect Miss Verinder of deceiving us all, by secreting the\r\nDiamond for some purpose of her own? Is that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Now, before you begin, I have to tell you, as Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s mother, that she is _absolutely incapable_ of doing what you\r\nsuppose her to have done. Your knowledge of her character dates from a\r\nday or two since. My knowledge of her character dates from the\r\nbeginning of her life. State your suspicion of her as strongly as you\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x94it is impossible that you can offend me by doing so. I am sure,\r\nbeforehand, that (with all your experience) the circumstances have\r\nfatally misled you in this case. Mind! I am in possession of no private\r\ninformation. I am as absolutely shut out of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s confidence as\r\nyou are. My one reason for speaking positively, is the reason you have\r\nheard already. I know my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to me, and gave me her hand. I kissed it in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmay go on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, facing the Sergeant again as steadily as ever.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff bowed. My mistress had produced but one effect on him.\r\nHis hatchet-face softened for a moment, as if he was sorry for her. As\r\nto shaking him in his own conviction, it was plain to see that she had\r\nnot moved him by a single inch. He settled himself in his chair; and he\r\nbegan his vile attack on Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s character in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto look this matter in the face,\r\nfrom my point of view as well as from yours. Will you please to suppose\r\nyourself coming down here, in my place, and with my experience? and\r\nwill you allow me to mention very briefly what that experience has\r\nbeen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mistress signed to him that she would do this. The Sergeant went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last twenty years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been largely employed in\r\ncases of family scandal, acting in the capacity of confidential man.\r\nThe one result of my domestic practice which has any bearing on the\r\nmatter now in hand, is a result which I may state in two words. It is\r\nwell within my experience, that young ladies of rank and position do\r\noccasionally have private debts which they dare not acknowledge to\r\ntheir nearest relatives and friends. Sometimes, the milliner and the\r\njeweller are at the bottom of it. Sometimes, the money is wanted for\r\npurposes which I don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect in this case, and which I won\xe2\x80\x99t shock\r\nyou by mentioning. Bear in mind what I have said, my lady\xe2\x80\x94and now let\r\nus see how events in this house have forced me back on my own\r\nexperience, whether I liked it or not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered with himself for a moment, and went on\xe2\x80\x94with a horrid\r\nclearness that obliged you to understand him; with an abominable\r\njustice that favoured nobody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first information relating to the loss of the Moonstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant, \xe2\x80\x9ccame to me from Superintendent Seegrave. He proved to my\r\ncomplete satisfaction that he was perfectly incapable of managing the\r\ncase. The one thing he said which struck me as worth listening to, was\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94that Miss Verinder had declined to be questioned by him, and had\r\nspoken to him with a perfectly incomprehensible rudeness and contempt.\r\nI thought this curious\xe2\x80\x94but I attributed it mainly to some clumsiness on\r\nthe Superintendent\xe2\x80\x99s part which might have offended the young lady.\r\nAfter that, I put it by in my mind, and applied myself, single-handed,\r\nto the case. It ended, as you are aware, in the discovery of the smear\r\non the door, and in Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s evidence satisfying me, that\r\nthis same smear, and the loss of the Diamond, were pieces of the same\r\npuzzle. So far, if I suspected anything, I suspected that the Moonstone\r\nhad been stolen, and that one of the servants might prove to be the\r\nthief. Very good. In this state of things, what happens? Miss Verinder\r\nsuddenly comes out of her room, and speaks to me. I observe three\r\nsuspicious appearances in that young lady. She is still violently\r\nagitated, though more than four-and-twenty hours have passed since the\r\nDiamond was lost. She treats me as she has already treated\r\nSuperintendent Seegrave. And she is mortally offended with Mr. Franklin\r\nBlake. Very good again. Here (I say to myself) is a young lady who has\r\nlost a valuable jewel\xe2\x80\x94a young lady, also, as my own eyes and ears\r\ninform me, who is of an impetuous temperament. Under these\r\ncircumstances, and with that character, what does she do? She betrays\r\nan incomprehensible resentment against Mr. Blake, Mr. Superintendent,\r\nand myself\xe2\x80\x94otherwise, the very three people who have all, in their\r\ndifferent ways, been trying to help her to recover her lost jewel.\r\nHaving brought my inquiry to that point\xe2\x80\x94_then_, my lady, and not till\r\nthen, I begin to look back into my own mind for my own experience. My\r\nown experience explains Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise incomprehensible\r\nconduct. It associates her with those other young ladies that I know\r\nof. It tells me she has debts she daren\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge, that must be\r\npaid. And it sets me asking myself, whether the loss of the Diamond may\r\nnot mean\xe2\x80\x94that the Diamond must be secretly pledged to pay them. That is\r\nthe conclusion which my experience draws from plain facts. What does\r\nyour ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s experience say against it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have said already,\xe2\x80\x9d answered my mistress. \xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances\r\nhave misled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said nothing on my side. _Robinson Crusoe_\xe2\x80\x94God knows how\xe2\x80\x94had got into\r\nmy muddled old head. If Sergeant Cuff had found himself, at that\r\nmoment, transported to a desert island, without a man Friday to keep\r\nhim company, or a ship to take him off\xe2\x80\x94he would have found himself\r\nexactly where I wished him to be! (_Nota bene:_\xe2\x80\x94I am an average good\r\nChristian, when you don\xe2\x80\x99t push my Christianity too far. And all the\r\nrest of you\xe2\x80\x94which is a great comfort\xe2\x80\x94are, in this respect, much the\r\nsame as I am.)\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight or wrong, my lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chaving drawn my conclusion, the\r\nnext thing to do was to put it to the test. I suggested to your\r\nladyship the examination of all the wardrobes in the house. It was a\r\nmeans of finding the article of dress which had, in all probability,\r\nmade the smear; and it was a means of putting my conclusion to the\r\ntest. How did it turn out? Your ladyship consented; Mr. Blake\r\nconsented; Mr. Ablewhite consented. Miss Verinder alone stopped the\r\nwhole proceeding by refusing point-blank. That result satisfied me that\r\nmy view was the right one. If your ladyship and Mr. Betteredge persist\r\nin not agreeing with me, you must be blind to what happened before you\r\nthis very day. In your hearing, I told the young lady that her leaving\r\nthe house (as things were then) would put an obstacle in the way of my\r\nrecovering her jewel. You saw yourselves that she drove off in the face\r\nof that statement. You saw yourself that, so far from forgiving Mr.\r\nBlake for having done more than all the rest of you to put the clue\r\ninto my hands, she publicly insulted Mr. Blake, on the steps of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s house. What do these things mean? If Miss Verinder is not\r\nprivy to the suppression of the Diamond, what do these things mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time he looked my way. It was downright frightful to hear him\r\npiling up proof after proof against Miss Rachel, and to know, while one\r\nwas longing to defend her, that there was no disputing the truth of\r\nwhat he said. I am (thank God!) constitutionally superior to reason.\r\nThis enabled me to hold firm to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s view, which was my view also.\r\nThis roused my spirit, and made me put a bold face on it before\r\nSergeant Cuff. Profit, good friends, I beseech you, by my example. It\r\nwill save you from many troubles of the vexing sort. Cultivate a\r\nsuperiority to reason, and see how you pare the claws of all the\r\nsensible people when they try to scratch you for your own good!\r\n\r\nFinding that I made no remark, and that my mistress made no remark,\r\nSergeant Cuff proceeded. Lord! how it did enrage me to notice that he\r\nwas not in the least put out by our silence!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the case, my lady, as it stands against Miss Verinder alone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing is to put the case as it stands against Miss\r\nVerinder and the deceased Rosanna Spearman taken together. We will go\r\nback for a moment, if you please, to your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to let her\r\nwardrobe be examined. My mind being made up, after that circumstance, I\r\nhad two questions to consider next. First, as to the right method of\r\nconducting my inquiry. Second, as to whether Miss Verinder had an\r\naccomplice among the female servants in the house. After carefully\r\nthinking it over, I determined to conduct the inquiry in, what we\r\nshould call at our office, a highly irregular manner. For this reason:\r\nI had a family scandal to deal with, which it was my business to keep\r\nwithin the family limits. The less noise made, and the fewer strangers\r\nemployed to help me, the better. As to the usual course of taking\r\npeople in custody on suspicion, going before the magistrate, and all\r\nthe rest of it\xe2\x80\x94nothing of the sort was to be thought of, when your\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was (as I believed) at the bottom of the whole\r\nbusiness. In this case, I felt that a person of Mr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharacter and position in the house\xe2\x80\x94knowing the servants as he did, and\r\nhaving the honour of the family at heart\xe2\x80\x94would be safer to take as an\r\nassistant than any other person whom I could lay my hand on. I should\r\nhave tried Mr. Blake as well\xe2\x80\x94but for one obstacle in the way. _He_ saw\r\nthe drift of my proceedings at a very early date; and, with his\r\ninterest in Miss Verinder, any mutual understanding was impossible\r\nbetween him and me. I trouble your ladyship with these particulars to\r\nshow you that I have kept the family secret within the family circle. I\r\nam the only outsider who knows it\xe2\x80\x94and my professional existence depends\r\non holding my tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere I felt that _my_ professional existence depended on not holding\r\n_my_ tongue. To be held up before my mistress, in my old age, as a sort\r\nof deputy-policeman, was, once again, more than my Christianity was\r\nstrong enough to bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to inform your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I never, to my\r\nknowledge, helped this abominable detective business, in any way, from\r\nfirst to last; and I summon Sergeant Cuff to contradict me, if he\r\ndares!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving given vent in those words, I felt greatly relieved. Her ladyship\r\nhonoured me by a little friendly pat on the shoulder. I looked with\r\nrighteous indignation at the Sergeant, to see what he thought of such a\r\ntestimony as _that!_ The Sergeant looked back like a lamb, and seemed\r\nto like me better than ever.\r\n\r\nMy lady informed him that he might continue his statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have honestly done your best, in what\r\nyou believe to be my interest. I am ready to hear what you have to say\r\nnext.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have to say next,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sergeant Cuff, \xe2\x80\x9crelates to Rosanna\r\nSpearman. I recognised the young woman, as your ladyship may remember,\r\nwhen she brought the washing-book into this room. Up to that time I was\r\ninclined to doubt whether Miss Verinder had trusted her secret to\r\nanyone. When I saw Rosanna, I altered my mind. I suspected her at once\r\nof being privy to the suppression of the Diamond. The poor creature has\r\nmet her death by a dreadful end, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your ladyship to\r\nthink, now she\xe2\x80\x99s gone, that I was unduly hard on her. If this had been\r\na common case of thieving, I should have given Rosanna the benefit of\r\nthe doubt just as freely as I should have given it to any of the other\r\nservants in the house. Our experience of the Reformatory woman is, that\r\nwhen tried in service\xe2\x80\x94and when kindly and judiciously treated\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nprove themselves in the majority of cases to be honestly penitent, and\r\nhonestly worthy of the pains taken with them. But this was not a common\r\ncase of thieving. It was a case\xe2\x80\x94in my mind\xe2\x80\x94of a deeply planned fraud,\r\nwith the owner of the Diamond at the bottom of it. Holding this view,\r\nthe first consideration which naturally presented itself to me, in\r\nconnection with Rosanna, was this: Would Miss Verinder be satisfied\r\n(begging your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon) with leading us all to think that the\r\nMoonstone was merely lost? Or would she go a step further, and delude\r\nus into believing that the Moonstone was stolen? In the latter event\r\nthere was Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x94with the character of a thief\xe2\x80\x94ready to her\r\nhand; the person of all others to lead your ladyship off, and to lead\r\nme off, on a false scent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas it possible (I asked myself) that he could put his case against\r\nMiss Rachel and Rosanna in a more horrid point of view than this? It\r\n_was_ possible, as you shall now see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had another reason for suspecting the deceased woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich appears to me to have been stronger still. Who would be the very\r\nperson to help Miss Verinder in raising money privately on the Diamond?\r\nRosanna Spearman. No young lady in Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s position could\r\nmanage such a risky matter as that by herself. A go-between she must\r\nhave, and who so fit, I ask again, as Rosanna Spearman? Your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeceased housemaid was at the top of her profession when she was a\r\nthief. She had relations, to my certain knowledge, with one of the few\r\nmen in London (in the money-lending line) who would advance a large sum\r\non such a notable jewel as the Moonstone, without asking awkward\r\nquestions, or insisting on awkward conditions. Bear this in mind, my\r\nlady; and now let me show you how my suspicions have been justified by\r\nRosanna\xe2\x80\x99s own acts, and by the plain inferences to be drawn from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe thereupon passed the whole of Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings under review.\r\nYou are already as well acquainted with those proceedings as I am; and\r\nyou will understand how unanswerably this part of his report fixed the\r\nguilt of being concerned in the disappearance of the Moonstone on the\r\nmemory of the poor dead girl. Even my mistress was daunted by what he\r\nsaid now. She made him no answer when he had done. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nmatter to the Sergeant whether he was answered or not. On he went\r\n(devil take him!), just as steady as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving stated the whole case as I understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nonly to tell your ladyship, now, what I propose to do next. I see two\r\nways of bringing this inquiry successfully to an end. One of those ways\r\nI look upon as a certainty. The other, I admit, is a bold experiment,\r\nand nothing more. Your ladyship shall decide. Shall we take the\r\ncertainty first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mistress made him a sign to take his own way, and choose for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll begin with the certainty, as\r\nyour ladyship is so good as to leave it to me. Whether Miss Verinder\r\nremains at Frizinghall, or whether she returns here, I propose, in\r\neither case, to keep a careful watch on all her proceedings\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\npeople she sees, on the rides and walks she may take, and on the\r\nletters she may write and receive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall next,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9crequest your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s leave\r\nto introduce into the house, as a servant in the place of Rosanna\r\nSpearman, a woman accustomed to private inquiries of this sort, for\r\nwhose discretion I can answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cand last, I propose to send one of my\r\nbrother-officers to make an arrangement with that money-lender in\r\nLondon, whom I mentioned just now as formerly acquainted with Rosanna\r\nSpearman\xe2\x80\x94and whose name and address, your ladyship may rely on it, have\r\nbeen communicated by Rosanna to Miss Verinder. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that the\r\ncourse of action I am now suggesting will cost money, and consume time.\r\nBut the result is certain. We run a line round the Moonstone, and we\r\ndraw that line closer and closer till we find it in Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossession, supposing she decides to keep it. If her debts press, and\r\nshe decides on sending it away, then we have our man ready, and we meet\r\nthe Moonstone on its arrival in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo hear her own daughter made the subject of such a proposal as this,\r\nstung my mistress into speaking angrily for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider your proposal declined, in every particular,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\ngo on to your other way of bringing the inquiry to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy other way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, going on as easy as ever, \xe2\x80\x9cis to try\r\nthat bold experiment to which I have alluded. I think I have formed a\r\npretty correct estimate of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s temperament. She is quite\r\ncapable (according to my belief) of committing a daring fraud. But she\r\nis too hot and impetuous in temper, and too little accustomed to deceit\r\nas a habit, to act the hypocrite in small things, and to restrain\r\nherself under all provocations. Her feelings, in this case, have\r\nrepeatedly got beyond her control, at the very time when it was plainly\r\nher interest to conceal them. It is on this peculiarity in her\r\ncharacter that I now propose to act. I want to give her a great shock\r\nsuddenly, under circumstances that will touch her to the quick. In\r\nplain English, I want to tell Miss Verinder, without a word of warning,\r\nof Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94on the chance that her own better feelings will\r\nhurry her into making a clean breast of it. Does your ladyship accept\r\n_that_ alternative?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mistress astonished me beyond all power of expression. She answered\r\nhim on the instant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pony-chaise is ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish your ladyship\r\ngood morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy lady held up her hand, and stopped him at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s better feelings shall be appealed to, as you propose,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I claim the right, as her mother, of putting her to the\r\ntest myself. You will remain here, if you please; and I will go to\r\nFrizinghall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor once in his life, the great Cuff stood speechless with amazement,\r\nlike an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nMy mistress rang the bell, and ordered her waterproof things. It was\r\nstill pouring with rain; and the close carriage had gone, as you know,\r\nwith Miss Rachel to Frizinghall. I tried to dissuade her ladyship from\r\nfacing the severity of the weather. Quite useless! I asked leave to go\r\nwith her, and hold the umbrella. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it. The\r\npony-chaise came round, with the groom in charge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may rely on two\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Sergeant Cuff, in the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try the\r\nexperiment on Miss Verinder as boldly as you could try it yourself. And\r\nI will inform you of the result, either personally or by letter, before\r\nthe last train leaves for London tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, she stepped into the chaise, and, taking the reins herself,\r\ndrove off to Frizinghall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nMy mistress having left us, I had leisure to think of Sergeant Cuff. I\r\nfound him sitting in a snug corner of the hall, consulting his\r\nmemorandum book, and curling up viciously at the corners of the lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking notes of the case?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking to see what my next professional\r\nengagement is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think it\xe2\x80\x99s all over then, here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sergeant Cuff, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Lady Verinder is one of the\r\ncleverest women in England. I also think a rose much better worth\r\nlooking at than a diamond. Where is the gardener, Mr. Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no getting a word more out of him on the matter of the\r\nMoonstone. He had lost all interest in his own inquiry; and he would\r\npersist in looking for the gardener. An hour afterwards, I heard them\r\nat high words in the conservatory, with the dog-rose once more at the\r\nbottom of the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, it was my business to find out whether Mr. Franklin\r\npersisted in his resolution to leave us by the afternoon train. After\r\nhaving been informed of the conference in my lady\xe2\x80\x99s room, and of how it\r\nhad ended, he immediately decided on waiting to hear the news from\r\nFrizinghall. This very natural alteration in his plans\xe2\x80\x94which, with\r\nordinary people, would have led to nothing in particular\xe2\x80\x94proved, in Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s case, to have one objectionable result. It left him\r\nunsettled, with a legacy of idle time on his hands, and, in so doing,\r\nit let out all the foreign sides of his character, one on the top of\r\nanother, like rats out of a bag.\r\n\r\nNow as an Italian-Englishman, now as a German-Englishman, and now as a\r\nFrench-Englishman, he drifted in and out of all the sitting-rooms in\r\nthe house, with nothing to talk of but Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of him;\r\nand with nobody to address himself to but me. I found him (for example)\r\nin the library, sitting under the map of Modern Italy, and quite\r\nunaware of any other method of meeting his troubles, except the method\r\nof talking about them. \xe2\x80\x9cI have several worthy aspirations, Betteredge;\r\nbut what am I to do with them now? I am full of dormant good qualities,\r\nif Rachel would only have helped me to bring them out!\xe2\x80\x9d He was so\r\neloquent in drawing the picture of his own neglected merits, and so\r\npathetic in lamenting over it when it was done, that I felt quite at my\r\nwits\xe2\x80\x99 end how to console him, when it suddenly occurred to me that here\r\nwas a case for the wholesome application of a bit of _Robinson Crusoe_.\r\nI hobbled out to my own room, and hobbled back with that immortal book.\r\nNobody in the library! The map of Modern Italy stared at _me_; and _I_\r\nstared at the map of Modern Italy.\r\n\r\nI tried the drawing-room. There was his handkerchief on the floor, to\r\nprove that he had drifted in. And there was the empty room to prove\r\nthat he had drifted out again.\r\n\r\nI tried the dining-room, and discovered Samuel with a biscuit and a\r\nglass of sherry, silently investigating the empty air. A minute since,\r\nMr. Franklin had rung furiously for a little light refreshment. On its\r\nproduction, in a violent hurry, by Samuel, Mr. Franklin had vanished\r\nbefore the bell downstairs had quite done ringing with the pull he had\r\ngiven to it.\r\n\r\nI tried the morning-room, and found him at last. There he was at the\r\nwindow, drawing hieroglyphics with his finger in the damp on the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sherry is waiting for you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to him. I might as well\r\nhave addressed myself to one of the four walls of the room; he was down\r\nin the bottomless deep of his own meditations, past all pulling up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ explain Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d was the only\r\nanswer I received. Not being ready with the needful reply, I produced\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_, in which I am firmly persuaded some explanation\r\nmight have been found, if we had only searched long enough for it. Mr.\r\nFranklin shut up _Robinson Crusoe_, and floundered into his\r\nGerman-English gibberish on the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not look into it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nas if I had personally objected to looking into it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil lose\r\nyour patience, Betteredge, when patience is all that\xe2\x80\x99s wanted to arrive\r\nat the truth? Don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is perfectly\r\nintelligible, if you will only do her the common justice to take the\r\nObjective view first, and the Subjective view next, and the\r\nObjective-Subjective view to wind up with. What do we know? We know\r\nthat the loss of the Moonstone, on Thursday morning last, threw her\r\ninto a state of nervous excitement, from which she has not recovered\r\nyet. Do you mean to deny the Objective view, so far? Very well,\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me. Now, being in a state of nervous excitement,\r\nhow are we to expect that she should behave as she might otherwise have\r\nbehaved to any of the people about her? Arguing in this way, from\r\nwithin-outwards, what do we reach? We reach the Subjective view. I defy\r\nyou to controvert the Subjective view. Very well then\xe2\x80\x94what follows?\r\nGood Heavens! the Objective-Subjective explanation follows, of course!\r\nRachel, properly speaking, is _not_ Rachel, but Somebody Else. Do I\r\nmind being cruelly treated by Somebody Else? You are unreasonable\r\nenough, Betteredge; but you can hardly accuse me of that. Then how does\r\nit end? It ends, in spite of your confounded English narrowness and\r\nprejudice, in my being perfectly happy and comfortable. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsherry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy head was by this time in such a condition, that I was not quite sure\r\nwhether it was my own head, or Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s. In this deplorable\r\nstate, I contrived to do, what I take to have been, three Objective\r\nthings. I got Mr. Franklin his sherry; I retired to my own room; and I\r\nsolaced myself with the most composing pipe of tobacco I ever remember\r\nto have smoked in my life.\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose, however, that I was quit of Mr. Franklin on such easy\r\nterms as these. Drifting again, out of the morning-room into the hall,\r\nhe found his way to the offices next, smelt my pipe, and was instantly\r\nreminded that he had been simple enough to give up smoking for Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s sake. In the twinkling of an eye, he burst in on me with his\r\ncigar-case, and came out strong on the one everlasting subject, in his\r\nneat, witty, unbelieving, French way. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a light, Betteredge. Is\r\nit conceivable that a man can have smoked as long as I have without\r\ndiscovering that there is a complete system for the treatment of women\r\nat the bottom of his cigar-case? Follow me carefully, and I will prove\r\nit in two words. You choose a cigar, you try it, and it disappoints\r\nyou. What do you do upon that? You throw it away and try another. Now\r\nobserve the application! You choose a woman, you try her, and she\r\nbreaks your heart. Fool! take a lesson from your cigar-case. Throw her\r\naway, and try another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head at that. Wonderfully clever, I dare say, but my own\r\nexperience was dead against it. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the time of the late Mrs.\r\nBetteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI felt pretty often inclined to try your\r\nphilosophy, Mr. Franklin. But the law insists on your smoking your\r\ncigar, sir, when you have once chosen it.\xe2\x80\x9d I pointed that observation\r\nwith a wink. Mr. Franklin burst out laughing\xe2\x80\x94and we were as merry as\r\ncrickets, until the next new side of his character turned up in due\r\ncourse. So things went on with my young master and me; and so (while\r\nthe Sergeant and the gardener were wrangling over the roses) we two\r\nspent the interval before the news came back from Frizinghall.\r\n\r\nThe pony-chaise returned a good half hour before I had ventured to\r\nexpect it. My lady had decided to remain for the present, at her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s house. The groom brought two letters from his mistress; one\r\naddressed to Mr. Franklin, and the other to me.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s letter I sent to him in the library\xe2\x80\x94into which refuge\r\nhis driftings had now taken him for the second time. My own letter, I\r\nread in my own room. A cheque, which dropped out when I opened it,\r\ninformed me (before I had mastered the contents) that Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndismissal from the inquiry after the Moonstone was now a settled thing.\r\n\r\nI sent to the conservatory to say that I wished to speak to the\r\nSergeant directly. He appeared, with his mind full of the gardener and\r\nthe dog-rose, declaring that the equal of Mr. Begbie for obstinacy\r\nnever had existed yet, and never would exist again. I requested him to\r\ndismiss such wretched trifling as this from our conversation, and to\r\ngive his best attention to a really serious matter. Upon that he\r\nexerted himself sufficiently to notice the letter in my hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid in a weary way, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have heard from her ladyship. Have I anything\r\nto do with it, Mr. Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall judge for yourself, Sergeant.\xe2\x80\x9d I thereupon read him the\r\nletter (with my best emphasis and discretion), in the following words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY GOOD GABRIEL,\xe2\x80\x94I request that you will inform Sergeant Cuff, that I\r\nhave performed the promise I made to him; with this result, so far as\r\nRosanna Spearman is concerned. Miss Verinder solemnly declares, that\r\nshe has never spoken a word in private to Rosanna, since that unhappy\r\nwoman first entered my house. They never met, even accidentally, on the\r\nnight when the Diamond was lost; and no communication of any sort\r\nwhatever took place between them, from the Thursday morning when the\r\nalarm was first raised in the house, to this present Saturday\r\nafternoon, when Miss Verinder left us. After telling my daughter\r\nsuddenly, and in so many words, of Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s suicide\xe2\x80\x94this is\r\nwhat has come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving reached that point, I looked up, and asked Sergeant Cuff what he\r\nthought of the letter, so far?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should only offend you if I expressed _my_ opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nSergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the most exasperating\r\nresignation, \xe2\x80\x9cgo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I remembered that this man had had the audacity to complain of our\r\ngardener\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy, my tongue itched to \xe2\x80\x9cgo on\xe2\x80\x9d in other words than\r\nmy mistress\xe2\x80\x99s. This time, however, my Christianity held firm. I\r\nproceeded steadily with her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s letter:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving appealed to Miss Verinder in the manner which the officer\r\nthought most desirable, I spoke to her next in the manner which I\r\nmyself thought most likely to impress her. On two different occasions,\r\nbefore my daughter left my roof, I privately warned her that she was\r\nexposing herself to suspicion of the most unendurable and most\r\ndegrading kind. I have now told her, in the plainest terms, that my\r\napprehensions have been realised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer answer to this, on her own solemn affirmation, is as plain as\r\nwords can be. In the first place, she owes no money privately to any\r\nliving creature. In the second place, the Diamond is not now, and never\r\nhas been, in her possession, since she put it into her cabinet on\r\nWednesday night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe confidence which my daughter has placed in me goes no further than\r\nthis. She maintains an obstinate silence, when I ask her if she can\r\nexplain the disappearance of the Diamond. She refuses, with tears, when\r\nI appeal to her to speak out for my sake. \xe2\x80\x98The day will come when you\r\nwill know why I am careless about being suspected, and why I am silent\r\neven to _you_. I have done much to make my mother pity me\xe2\x80\x94nothing to\r\nmake my mother blush for me.\xe2\x80\x99 Those are my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s own words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what has passed between the officer and me, I think\xe2\x80\x94stranger as\r\nhe is\xe2\x80\x94that he should be made acquainted with what Miss Verinder has\r\nsaid, as well as you. Read my letter to him, and then place in his\r\nhands the cheque which I enclose. In resigning all further claim on his\r\nservices, I have only to say that I am convinced of his honesty and his\r\nintelligence; but I am more firmly persuaded than ever, that the\r\ncircumstances, in this case, have fatally misled him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere the letter ended. Before presenting the cheque, I asked Sergeant\r\nCuff if he had any remark to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no part of my duty, Mr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cto make\r\nremarks on a case, when I have done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tossed the cheque across the table to him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in _that_\r\npart of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, indignantly.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant looked at the cheque, and lifted up his dismal eyebrows in\r\nacknowledgment of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s liberality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is such a generous estimate of the value of my time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat I feel bound to make some return for it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear in mind the\r\namount in this cheque, Mr. Betteredge, when the occasion comes round\r\nfor remembering it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer ladyship has smoothed matters over for the present very cleverly,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cBut _this_ family scandal is of the sort that\r\nbursts up again when you least expect it. We shall have more\r\ndetective-business on our hands, sir, before the Moonstone is many\r\nmonths older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf those words meant anything, and if the manner in which he spoke them\r\nmeant anything\xe2\x80\x94it came to this. My mistress\xe2\x80\x99s letter had proved, to his\r\nmind, that Miss Rachel was hardened enough to resist the strongest\r\nappeal that could be addressed to her, and that she had deceived her\r\nown mother (good God, under what circumstances!) by a series of\r\nabominable lies. How other people, in my place, might have replied to\r\nthe Sergeant, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I answered what he said in these plain\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Cuff, I consider your last observation as an insult to my\r\nlady and her daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge, consider it as a warning to yourself, and you will be\r\nnearer the mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHot and angry as I was, the infernal confidence with which he gave me\r\nthat answer closed my lips.\r\n\r\nI walked to the window to compose myself. The rain had given over; and,\r\nwho should I see in the court-yard, but Mr. Begbie, the gardener,\r\nwaiting outside to continue the dog-rose controversy with Sergeant\r\nCuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy compliments to the Sairgent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Begbie, the moment he set\r\neyes on me. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s minded to walk to the station, I\xe2\x80\x99m agreeable to go\r\nwith him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cries the Sergeant, behind me, \xe2\x80\x9care you not convinced yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe de\xe2\x80\x99il a bit I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Begbie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk to the station!\xe2\x80\x9d says the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you at the gate!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Begbie.\r\n\r\nI was angry enough, as you know\xe2\x80\x94but how was any man\xe2\x80\x99s anger to hold out\r\nagainst such an interruption as this? Sergeant Cuff noticed the change\r\nin me, and encouraged it by a word in season. \xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy not treat my view of the case as her ladyship treats it? Why not\r\nsay, the circumstances have fatally misled me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo take anything as her ladyship took it was a privilege worth\r\nenjoying\xe2\x80\x94even with the disadvantage of its having been offered to me by\r\nSergeant Cuff. I cooled slowly down to my customary level. I regarded\r\nany other opinion of Miss Rachel, than my lady\xe2\x80\x99s opinion or mine, with\r\na lofty contempt. The only thing I could _not_ do, was to keep off the\r\nsubject of the Moonstone! My own good sense ought to have warned me, I\r\nknow, to let the matter rest\xe2\x80\x94but, there! the virtues which distinguish\r\nthe present generation were not invented in my time. Sergeant Cuff had\r\nhit me on the raw, and, though I did look down upon him with contempt,\r\nthe tender place still tingled for all that. The end of it was that I\r\nperversely led him back to the subject of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s letter. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nquite satisfied myself,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind that! Go on, as if I\r\nwas still open to conviction. You think Miss Rachel is not to be\r\nbelieved on her word; and you say we shall hear of the Moonstone again.\r\nBack your opinion, Sergeant,\xe2\x80\x9d I concluded, in an airy way. \xe2\x80\x9cBack your\r\nopinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of taking offence, Sergeant Cuff seized my hand, and shook it\r\ntill my fingers ached again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare to heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d says this strange officer solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\ntake to domestic service tomorrow, Mr. Betteredge, if I had a chance of\r\nbeing employed along with You! To say you are as transparent as a\r\nchild, sir, is to pay the children a compliment which nine out of ten\r\nof them don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve. There! there! we won\xe2\x80\x99t begin to dispute again.\r\nYou shall have it out of me on easier terms than that. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say a\r\nword more about her ladyship, or about Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll only turn\r\nprophet, for once in a way, and for your sake. I have warned you\r\nalready that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t done with the Moonstone yet. Very well. Now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, at parting, of three things which will happen in the\r\nfuture, and which, I believe, will force themselves on your attention,\r\nwhether you like it or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, quite unabashed, and just as airy as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will hear something from the\r\nYollands\xe2\x80\x94when the postman delivers Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s letter at Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, on\r\nMonday next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf he had thrown a bucket of cold water over me, I doubt if I could\r\nhave felt it much more unpleasantly than I felt those words. Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of her innocence had left Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmaking the new nightgown, the hiding the smeared nightgown, and all the\r\nrest of it\xe2\x80\x94entirely without explanation. And this had never occurred to\r\nme, till Sergeant Cuff forced it on my mind all in a moment!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the second place,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will hear of the\r\nthree Indians again. You will hear of them in the neighbourhood, if\r\nMiss Rachel remains in the neighbourhood. You will hear of them in\r\nLondon, if Miss Rachel goes to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving lost all interest in the three jugglers, and having thoroughly\r\nconvinced myself of my young lady\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, I took this second\r\nprophecy easily enough. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much for two of the three things that are\r\ngoing to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for the third!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThird, and last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will, sooner or later, hear\r\nsomething of that money-lender in London, whom I have twice taken the\r\nliberty of mentioning already. Give me your pocket-book, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\na note for you of his name and address\xe2\x80\x94so that there may be no mistake\r\nabout it if the thing really happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote accordingly on a blank leaf\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Septimus Luker,\r\nMiddlesex-place, Lambeth, London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the address, \xe2\x80\x9care the last words, on the\r\nsubject of the Moonstone, which I shall trouble you with for the\r\npresent. Time will show whether I am right or wrong. In the meanwhile,\r\nsir, I carry away with me a sincere personal liking for you, which I\r\nthink does honour to both of us. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t meet again before my\r\nprofessional retirement takes place, I hope you will come and see me in\r\na little house near London, which I have got my eye on. There will be\r\ngrass walks, Mr. Betteredge, I promise you, in _my_ garden. And as for\r\nthe white moss rose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe de\xe2\x80\x99il a bit ye\xe2\x80\x99ll get the white moss rose to grow, unless you bud\r\nhim on the dogue-rose first,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice at the window.\r\n\r\nWe both turned round. There was the everlasting Mr. Begbie, too eager\r\nfor the controversy to wait any longer at the gate. The Sergeant wrung\r\nmy hand, and darted out into the court-yard, hotter still on his side.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him about the moss rose, when he comes back, and see if I have\r\nleft him a leg to stand on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the great Cuff, hailing me through\r\nthe window in his turn. \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, both!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, moderating them\r\nagain as I had moderated them once already. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the matter of the moss\r\nrose there is a great deal to be said on both sides!\xe2\x80\x9d I might as well\r\n(as the Irish say) have whistled jigs to a milestone. Away they went\r\ntogether, fighting the battle of the roses without asking or giving\r\nquarter on either side. The last I saw of them, Mr. Begbie was shaking\r\nhis obstinate head, and Sergeant Cuff had got him by the arm like a\r\nprisoner in charge. Ah, well! well! I own I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help liking the\r\nSergeant\xe2\x80\x94though I hated him all the time.\r\n\r\nExplain that state of mind, if you can. You will soon be rid, now, of\r\nme and my contradictions. When I have reported Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture, the history of the Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s events will be finished at\r\nlast. And when I have next described certain strange things that\r\nhappened in the course of the new week, I shall have done my part of\r\nthe Story, and shall hand over the pen to the person who is appointed\r\nto follow my lead. If you are as tired of reading this narrative as I\r\nam of writing it\xe2\x80\x94Lord, how we shall enjoy ourselves on both sides a few\r\npages further on!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nI had kept the pony-chaise ready, in case Mr. Franklin persisted in\r\nleaving us by the train that night. The appearance of the luggage,\r\nfollowed downstairs by Mr. Franklin himself, informed me plainly enough\r\nthat he had held firm to a resolution for once in his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have really made up your mind, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, as we met in the\r\nhall. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not wait a day or two longer, and give Miss Rachel another\r\nchance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foreign varnish appeared to have all worn off Mr. Franklin, now\r\nthat the time had come for saying good-bye. Instead of replying to me\r\nin words, he put the letter which her ladyship had addressed to him\r\ninto my hand. The greater part of it said over again what had been said\r\nalready in the other communication received by me. But there was a bit\r\nabout Miss Rachel added at the end, which will account for the\r\nsteadiness of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s determination, if it accounts for nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will wonder, I dare say\xe2\x80\x9d (her ladyship wrote), \xe2\x80\x9cat my allowing my\r\nown daughter to keep me perfectly in the dark. A Diamond worth twenty\r\nthousand pounds has been lost\xe2\x80\x94and I am left to infer that the mystery\r\nof its disappearance is no mystery to Rachel, and that some\r\nincomprehensible obligation of silence has been laid on her, by some\r\nperson or persons utterly unknown to me, with some object in view at\r\nwhich I cannot even guess. Is it conceivable that I should allow myself\r\nto be trifled with in this way? It is quite conceivable, in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresent state. She is in a condition of nervous agitation pitiable to\r\nsee. I dare not approach the subject of the Moonstone again until time\r\nhas done something to quiet her. To help this end, I have not hesitated\r\nto dismiss the police-officer. The mystery which baffles us, baffles\r\nhim too. This is not a matter in which any stranger can help us. He\r\nadds to what I have to suffer; and he maddens Rachel if she only hears\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy plans for the future are as well settled as they can be. My present\r\nidea is to take Rachel to London\xe2\x80\x94partly to relieve her mind by a\r\ncomplete change, partly to try what may be done by consulting the best\r\nmedical advice. Can I ask you to meet us in town? My dear Franklin,\r\nyou, in your way, must imitate my patience, and wait, as I do, for a\r\nfitter time. The valuable assistance which you rendered to the inquiry\r\nafter the lost jewel is still an unpardoned offence, in the present\r\ndreadful state of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Moving blindfold in this matter, you\r\nhave added to the burden of anxiety which she has had to bear, by\r\ninnocently threatening her secret with discovery, through your\r\nexertions. It is impossible for me to excuse the perversity that holds\r\nyou responsible for consequences which neither you nor I could imagine\r\nor foresee. She is not to be reasoned with\xe2\x80\x94she can only be pitied. I am\r\ngrieved to have to say it, but for the present, you and Rachel are\r\nbetter apart. The only advice I can offer you is, to give her time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI handed the letter back, sincerely sorry for Mr. Franklin, for I knew\r\nhow fond he was of my young lady; and I saw that her mother\xe2\x80\x99s account\r\nof her had cut him to the heart. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the proverb, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was all I\r\nsaid to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen things are at the worst, they\xe2\x80\x99re sure to mend.\r\nThings can\xe2\x80\x99t be much worse, Mr. Franklin, than they are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin folded up his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s letter, without appearing to be much\r\ncomforted by the remark which I had ventured on addressing to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came here from London with that horrible Diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe there was a happier household in England than this. Look\r\nat the household now! Scattered, disunited\xe2\x80\x94the very air of the place\r\npoisoned with mystery and suspicion! Do you remember that morning at\r\nthe Shivering Sand, when we talked about my uncle Herncastle, and his\r\nbirthday gift? The Moonstone has served the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s vengeance,\r\nBetteredge, by means which the Colonel himself never dreamt of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he shook me by the hand, and went out to the pony-chaise.\r\n\r\nI followed him down the steps. It was very miserable to see him leaving\r\nthe old place, where he had spent the happiest years of his life, in\r\nthis way. Penelope (sadly upset by all that had happened in the house)\r\ncame round crying, to bid him good-bye. Mr. Franklin kissed her. I\r\nwaved my hand as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re heartily welcome, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d Some\r\nof the other female servants appeared, peeping after him round the\r\ncorner. He was one of those men whom the women all like. At the last\r\nmoment, I stopped the pony-chaise, and begged as a favour that he would\r\nlet us hear from him by letter. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to heed what I said\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas looking round from one thing to another, taking a sort of farewell\r\nof the old house and grounds. \xe2\x80\x9cTell us where you are going to, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid, holding on by the chaise, and trying to get at his future plans\r\nin that way. Mr. Franklin pulled his hat down suddenly over his eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, echoing the word after me. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe pony started at the word, as if he had felt a Christian horror of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, sir, go where you may!\xe2\x80\x9d was all I had time to say,\r\nbefore he was out of sight and hearing. A sweet and pleasant gentleman!\r\nWith all his faults and follies, a sweet and pleasant gentleman! He\r\nleft a sad gap behind him, when he left my lady\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nIt was dull and dreary enough, when the long summer evening closed in,\r\non that Saturday night.\r\n\r\nI kept my spirits from sinking by sticking fast to my pipe and my\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_. The women (excepting Penelope) beguiled the time by\r\ntalking of Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s suicide. They were all obstinately of opinion that\r\nthe poor girl had stolen the Moonstone, and that she had destroyed\r\nherself in terror of being found out. My daughter, of course, privately\r\nheld fast to what she had said all along. Her notion of the motive\r\nwhich was really at the bottom of the suicide failed, oddly enough,\r\njust where my young lady\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of her innocence failed also. It\r\nleft Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s secret journey to Frizinghall, and Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings\r\nin the matter of the nightgown entirely unaccounted for. There was no\r\nuse in pointing this out to Penelope; the objection made about as much\r\nimpression on her as a shower of rain on a waterproof coat. The truth\r\nis, my daughter inherits my superiority to reason\xe2\x80\x94and, in respect to\r\nthat accomplishment, has got a long way ahead of her own father.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (Sunday), the close carriage, which had been kept at\r\nMr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s, came back to us empty. The coachman brought a message\r\nfor me, and written instructions for my lady\xe2\x80\x99s own maid and for\r\nPenelope.\r\n\r\nThe message informed me that my mistress had determined to take Miss\r\nRachel to her house in London, on the Monday. The written instructions\r\ninformed the two maids of the clothing that was wanted, and directed\r\nthem to meet their mistresses in town at a given hour. Most of the\r\nother servants were to follow. My lady had found Miss Rachel so\r\nunwilling to return to the house, after what had happened in it, that\r\nshe had decided on going to London direct from Frizinghall. I was to\r\nremain in the country, until further orders, to look after things\r\nindoors and out. The servants left with me were to be put on board\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nBeing reminded, by all this, of what Mr. Franklin had said about our\r\nbeing a scattered and disunited household, my mind was led naturally to\r\nMr. Franklin himself. The more I thought of him, the more uneasy I felt\r\nabout his future proceedings. It ended in my writing, by the Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npost, to his father\xe2\x80\x99s valet, Mr. Jeffco (whom I had known in former\r\nyears) to beg he would let me know what Mr. Franklin had settled to do,\r\non arriving in London.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday evening was, if possible, duller even than the Saturday\r\nevening. We ended the day of rest, as hundreds of thousands of people\r\nend it regularly, once a week, in these islands\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, we all\r\nanticipated bedtime, and fell asleep in our chairs.\r\n\r\nHow the Monday affected the rest of the household I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. The\r\nMonday gave _me_ a good shake up. The first of Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophecies of what was to happen\xe2\x80\x94namely, that I should hear from the\r\nYollands\xe2\x80\x94came true on that day.\r\n\r\nI had seen Penelope and my lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid off in the railway with the\r\nluggage for London, and was pottering about the grounds, when I heard\r\nmy name called. Turning round, I found myself face to face with the\r\nfisherman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Limping Lucy. Bating her lame foot and her\r\nleanness (this last a horrid draw-back to a woman, in my opinion), the\r\ngirl had some pleasing qualities in the eye of a man. A dark, keen,\r\nclever face, and a nice clear voice, and a beautiful brown head of hair\r\ncounted among her merits. A crutch appeared in the list of her\r\nmisfortunes. And a temper reckoned high in the sum total of her\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the man you call Franklin Blake?\xe2\x80\x9d says the girl, fixing me\r\nwith a fierce look, as she rested herself on her crutch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a respectful way to speak of any gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to inquire for my lady\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, you will please to\r\nmention him as Mr. Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe limped a step nearer to me, and looked as if she could have eaten\r\nme alive. \xe2\x80\x9c_Mr._ Franklin Blake?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated after me. \xe2\x80\x9cMurderer\r\nFranklin Blake would be a fitter name for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy practice with the late Mrs. Betteredge came in handy here. Whenever\r\na woman tries to put _you_ out of temper, turn the tables, and put\r\n_her_ out of temper instead. They are generally prepared for every\r\neffort you can make in your own defence, but that. One word does it as\r\nwell as a hundred; and one word did it with Limping Lucy. I looked her\r\npleasantly in the face; and I said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s temper flamed out directly. She poised herself on her sound\r\nfoot, and she took her crutch, and beat it furiously three times on the\r\nground. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer! he\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer! he\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer! He has been\r\nthe death of Rosanna Spearman!\xe2\x80\x9d She screamed that answer out at the top\r\nof her voice. One or two of the people at work in the grounds near us\r\nlooked up\xe2\x80\x94saw it was Limping Lucy\xe2\x80\x94knew what to expect from that\r\nquarter\xe2\x80\x94and looked away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been the death of Rosanna Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes\r\nyou say that, Lucy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you care? What does any man care? Oh! if she had only thought\r\nof the men as I think, she might have been living now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always thought kindly of _me_, poor soul,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cand, to the\r\nbest of my ability, I always tried to act kindly by _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI spoke those words in as comforting a manner as I could. The truth is,\r\nI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to irritate the girl by another of my smart replies.\r\nI had only noticed her temper at first. I noticed her wretchedness\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94and wretchedness is not uncommonly insolent, you will find, in\r\nhumble life. My answer melted Limping Lucy. She bent her head down, and\r\nlaid it on the top of her crutch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved her,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said softly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had lived a miserable life,\r\nMr. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94vile people had ill-treated her and led her wrong\xe2\x80\x94and it\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoiled her sweet temper. She was an angel. She might have been\r\nhappy with me. I had a plan for our going to London together like\r\nsisters, and living by our needles. That man came here, and spoilt it\r\nall. He bewitched her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nit. He ought to have known it. He ought to have taken pity on her. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t live without him\xe2\x80\x94and, oh, Lucy, he never even looks at me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what she said. Cruel, cruel, cruel. I said, \xe2\x80\x98No man is worth\r\nfretting for in that way.\xe2\x80\x99 And she said, \xe2\x80\x98There are men worth dying\r\nfor, Lucy, and he is one of them.\xe2\x80\x99 I had saved up a little money. I had\r\nsettled things with father and mother. I meant to take her away from\r\nthe mortification she was suffering here. We should have had a little\r\nlodging in London, and lived together like sisters. She had a good\r\neducation, sir, as you know, and she wrote a good hand. She was quick\r\nat her needle. I have a good education, and I write a good hand. I am\r\nnot as quick at my needle as she was\xe2\x80\x94but I could have done. We might\r\nhave got our living nicely. And, oh! what happens this morning? what\r\nhappens this morning? Her letter comes and tells me that she has done\r\nwith the burden of her life. Her letter comes, and bids me good-bye for\r\never. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d cries the girl, lifting her head from the crutch,\r\nand flaming out again through her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s this gentleman that I\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak of, except with respect? Ha, Mr. Betteredge, the day is\r\nnot far off when the poor will rise against the rich. I pray Heaven\r\nthey may begin with _him_. I pray Heaven they may begin with _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was another of your average good Christians, and here was the\r\nusual break-down, consequent on that same average Christianity being\r\npushed too far! The parson himself (though I own this is saying a great\r\ndeal) could hardly have lectured the girl in the state she was in now.\r\nAll I ventured to do was to keep her to the point\xe2\x80\x94in the hope of\r\nsomething turning up which might be worth hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with Mr. Franklin Blake?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor anything particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a letter to give him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Rosanna Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSent to you in your own letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas the darkness going to lift? Were all the discoveries that I was\r\ndying to make, coming and offering themselves to me of their own\r\naccord? I was obliged to wait a moment. Sergeant Cuff had left his\r\ninfection behind him. Certain signs and tokens, personal to myself,\r\nwarned me that the detective-fever was beginning to set in again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t see Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, and will, see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went to London last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimping Lucy looked me hard in the face, and saw that I was speaking\r\nthe truth. Without a word more, she turned about again instantly\r\ntowards Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect news of Mr. Franklin Blake tomorrow. Give me\r\nyour letter, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it on to him by the post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLimping Lucy steadied herself on her crutch and looked back at me over\r\nher shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to give it from my hands into his hands,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am to\r\ngive it to him in no other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I write, and tell him what you have said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him I hate him. And you will tell him the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. But about the letter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he wants the letter, he must come back here, and get it from Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words she limped off on the way to Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole. The\r\ndetective-fever burnt up all my dignity on the spot. I followed her,\r\nand tried to make her talk. All in vain. It was my misfortune to be a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94and Limping Lucy enjoyed disappointing me. Later in the day, I\r\ntried my luck with her mother. Good Mrs. Yolland could only cry, and\r\nrecommend a drop of comfort out of the Dutch bottle. I found the\r\nfisherman on the beach. He said it was \xe2\x80\x9ca bad job,\xe2\x80\x9d and went on mending\r\nhis net. Neither father nor mother knew more than I knew. The one way\r\nleft to try was the chance, which might come with the morning, of\r\nwriting to Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\nI leave you to imagine how I watched for the postman on Tuesday\r\nmorning. He brought me two letters. One, from Penelope (which I had\r\nhardly patience enough to read), announced that my lady and Miss Rachel\r\nwere safely established in London. The other, from Mr. Jeffco, informed\r\nme that his master\xe2\x80\x99s son had left England already.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the metropolis, Mr. Franklin had, it appeared, gone\r\nstraight to his father\xe2\x80\x99s residence. He arrived at an awkward time. Mr.\r\nBlake, the elder, was up to his eyes in the business of the House of\r\nCommons, and was amusing himself at home that night with the favourite\r\nparliamentary plaything which they call \xe2\x80\x9ca private bill.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jeffco\r\nhimself showed Mr. Franklin into his father\xe2\x80\x99s study. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Franklin!\r\nwhy do you surprise me in this way? Anything wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes; something\r\nwrong with Rachel; I am dreadfully distressed about it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGrieved to\r\nhear it. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you now.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhen _can_ you listen?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndear boy! I won\xe2\x80\x99t deceive you. I can listen at the end of the session,\r\nnot a moment before. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the conversation, inside the study, as reported to me by Mr.\r\nJeffco. The conversation outside the study, was shorter still. \xe2\x80\x9cJeffco,\r\nsee what time the tidal train starts tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAt six-forty,\r\nMr. Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHave me called at five.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGoing abroad, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGoing,\r\nJeffco, wherever the railway chooses to take me.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell your\r\nfather, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes; tell him at the end of the session.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning Mr. Franklin had started for foreign parts. To what\r\nparticular place he was bound, nobody (himself included) could presume\r\nto guess. We might hear of him next in Europe, Asia, Africa, or\r\nAmerica. The chances were as equally divided as possible, in Mr.\r\nJeffco\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, among the four quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis news\xe2\x80\x94by closing up all prospects of my bringing Limping Lucy and\r\nMr. Franklin together\xe2\x80\x94at once stopped any further progress of mine on\r\nthe way to discovery. Penelope\xe2\x80\x99s belief that her fellow-servant had\r\ndestroyed herself through unrequited love for Mr. Franklin Blake, was\r\nconfirmed\xe2\x80\x94and that was all. Whether the letter which Rosanna had left\r\nto be given to him after her death did, or did not, contain the\r\nconfession which Mr. Franklin had suspected her of trying to make to\r\nhim in her life-time, it was impossible to say. It might be only a\r\nfarewell word, telling nothing but the secret of her unhappy fancy for\r\na person beyond her reach. Or it might own the whole truth about the\r\nstrange proceedings in which Sergeant Cuff had detected her, from the\r\ntime when the Moonstone was lost, to the time when she rushed to her\r\nown destruction at the Shivering Sand. A sealed letter it had been\r\nplaced in Limping Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and a sealed letter it remained to me\r\nand to everyone about the girl, her own parents included. We all\r\nsuspected her of having been in the dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s confidence; we all\r\ntried to make her speak; we all failed. Now one, and now another, of\r\nthe servants\xe2\x80\x94still holding to the belief that Rosanna had stolen the\r\nDiamond and had hidden it\xe2\x80\x94peered and poked about the rocks to which she\r\nhad been traced, and peered and poked in vain. The tide ebbed, and the\r\ntide flowed; the summer went on, and the autumn came. And the\r\nQuicksand, which hid her body, hid her secret too.\r\n\r\nThe news of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s departure from England on the Sunday\r\nmorning, and the news of my lady\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in London with Miss Rachel\r\non the Monday afternoon, had reached me, as you are aware, by the\r\nTuesday\xe2\x80\x99s post. The Wednesday came, and brought nothing. The Thursday\r\nproduced a second budget of news from Penelope.\r\n\r\nMy girl\xe2\x80\x99s letter informed me that some great London doctor had been\r\nconsulted about her young lady, and had earned a guinea by remarking\r\nthat she had better be amused. Flower-shows, operas, balls\xe2\x80\x94there was a\r\nwhole round of gaieties in prospect; and Miss Rachel, to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishment, eagerly took to it all. Mr. Godfrey had called; evidently\r\nas sweet as ever on his cousin, in spite of the reception he had met\r\nwith, when he tried his luck on the occasion of the birthday. To\r\nPenelope\xe2\x80\x99s great regret, he had been most graciously received, and had\r\nadded Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s name to one of his Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Charities on the spot.\r\nMy mistress was reported to be out of spirits, and to have held two\r\nlong interviews with her lawyer. Certain speculations followed,\r\nreferring to a poor relation of the family\xe2\x80\x94one Miss Clack, whom I have\r\nmentioned in my account of the birthday dinner, as sitting next to Mr.\r\nGodfrey, and having a pretty taste in champagne. Penelope was\r\nastonished to find that Miss Clack had not called yet. She would surely\r\nnot be long before she fastened herself on my lady as usual\xe2\x80\x94and so\r\nforth, and so forth, in the way women have of girding at each other, on\r\nand off paper. This would not have been worth mentioning, I admit, but\r\nfor one reason. I hear you are likely to be turned over to Miss Clack,\r\nafter parting with me. In that case, just do me the favour of not\r\nbelieving a word she says, if she speaks of your humble servant.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, nothing happened\xe2\x80\x94except that one of the dogs showed signs of\r\na breaking out behind the ears. I gave him a dose of syrup of\r\nbuckthorn, and put him on a diet of pot-liquor and vegetables till\r\nfurther orders. Excuse my mentioning this. It has slipped in somehow.\r\nPass it over please. I am fast coming to the end of my offences against\r\nyour cultivated modern taste. Besides, the dog was a good creature, and\r\ndeserved a good physicking; he did indeed.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the last day of the week, is also the last day in my\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nThe morning\xe2\x80\x99s post brought me a surprise in the shape of a London\r\nnewspaper. The handwriting on the direction puzzled me. I compared it\r\nwith the money-lender\xe2\x80\x99s name and address as recorded in my pocket-book,\r\nand identified it at once as the writing of Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nLooking through the paper eagerly enough, after this discovery, I found\r\nan ink-mark drawn round one of the police reports. Here it is, at your\r\nservice. Read it as I read it, and you will set the right value on the\r\nSergeant\xe2\x80\x99s polite attention in sending me the news of the day:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLAMBETH\xe2\x80\x94Shortly before the closing of the court, Mr. Septimus Luker,\r\nthe well-known dealer in ancient gems, carvings, intagli, &c., &c.,\r\napplied to the sitting magistrate for advice. The applicant stated that\r\nhe had been annoyed, at intervals throughout the day, by the\r\nproceedings of some of those strolling Indians who infest the streets.\r\nThe persons complained of were three in number. After having been sent\r\naway by the police, they had returned again and again, and had\r\nattempted to enter the house on pretence of asking for charity. Warned\r\noff in the front, they had been discovered again at the back of the\r\npremises. Besides the annoyance complained of, Mr. Luker expressed\r\nhimself as being under some apprehension that robbery might be\r\ncontemplated. His collection contained many unique gems, both classical\r\nand Oriental, of the highest value. He had only the day before been\r\ncompelled to dismiss a skilled workman in ivory carving from his\r\nemployment (a native of India, as we understood), on suspicion of\r\nattempted theft; and he felt by no means sure that this man and the\r\nstreet jugglers of whom he complained, might not be acting in concert.\r\nIt might be their object to collect a crowd, and create a disturbance\r\nin the street, and, in the confusion thus caused, to obtain access to\r\nthe house. In reply to the magistrate, Mr. Luker admitted that he had\r\nno evidence to produce of any attempt at robbery being in\r\ncontemplation. He could speak positively to the annoyance and\r\ninterruption caused by the Indians, but not to anything else. The\r\nmagistrate remarked that, if the annoyance were repeated, the applicant\r\ncould summon the Indians to that court, where they might easily be\r\ndealt with under the Act. As to the valuables in Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossession, Mr. Luker himself must take the best measures for their\r\nsafe custody. He would do well perhaps to communicate with the police,\r\nand to adopt such additional precautions as their experience might\r\nsuggest. The applicant thanked his worship, and withdrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the wise ancients is reported (I forget on what occasion) as\r\nhaving recommended his fellow-creatures to \xe2\x80\x9clook to the end.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking\r\nto the end of these pages of mine, and wondering for some days past how\r\nI should manage to write it, I find my plain statement of facts coming\r\nto a conclusion, most appropriately, of its own self. We have gone on,\r\nin this matter of the Moonstone, from one marvel to another; and here\r\nwe end with the greatest marvel of all\xe2\x80\x94namely, the accomplishment of\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s three predictions in less than a week from the time\r\nwhen he had made them.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing from the Yollands on the Monday, I had now heard of the\r\nIndians, and heard of the money-lender, in the news from London\xe2\x80\x94Miss\r\nRachel herself remember, being also in London at the time. You see, I\r\nput things at their worst, even when they tell dead against my own\r\nview. If you desert me, and side with the Sergeant, on the evidence\r\nbefore you\xe2\x80\x94if the only rational explanation you can see is, that Miss\r\nRachel and Mr. Luker must have got together, and that the Moonstone\r\nmust be now in pledge in the money-lender\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x94I own, I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame\r\nyou for arriving at that conclusion. In the dark, I have brought you\r\nthus far. In the dark I am compelled to leave you, with my best\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nWhy compelled? it may be asked. Why not take the persons who have gone\r\nalong with me, so far, up into those regions of superior enlightenment\r\nin which I sit myself?\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, I can only state that I am acting under orders, and\r\nthat those orders have been given to me (as I understand) in the\r\ninterests of truth. I am forbidden to tell more in this narrative than\r\nI knew myself at the time. Or, to put it plainer, I am to keep strictly\r\nwithin the limits of my own experience, and am not to inform you of\r\nwhat other persons told me\xe2\x80\x94for the very sufficient reason that you are\r\nto have the information from those other persons themselves, at first\r\nhand. In this matter of the Moonstone the plan is, not to present\r\nreports, but to produce witnesses. I picture to myself a member of the\r\nfamily reading these pages fifty years hence. Lord! what a compliment\r\nhe will feel it, to be asked to take nothing on hear-say, and to be\r\ntreated in all respects like a Judge on the bench.\r\n\r\nAt this place, then, we part\xe2\x80\x94for the present, at least\xe2\x80\x94after long\r\njourneying together, with a companionable feeling, I hope, on both\r\nsides. The devil\xe2\x80\x99s dance of the Indian Diamond has threaded its way to\r\nLondon; and to London you must go after it, leaving me at the country\r\nhouse. Please to excuse the faults of this composition\xe2\x80\x94my talking so\r\nmuch of myself, and being too familiar, I am afraid, with you. I mean\r\nno harm; and I drink most respectfully (having just done dinner) to\r\nyour health and prosperity, in a tankard of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s ale. May you\r\nfind in these leaves of my writing, what _Robinson Crusoe_ found in his\r\nexperience on the desert island\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9csomething to comfort\r\nyourselves from, and to set in the Description of Good and Evil, on the\r\nCredit Side of the Account.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Farewell.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIRST PERIOD.\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE DISCOVERY OF THE TRUTH. (1848-1849.)\r\n\r\n_The Events related in several Narratives._\r\n\r\nFIRST NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Miss Clack; niece of the late Sir John Verinder_\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nI am indebted to my dear parents (both now in heaven) for having had\r\nhabits of order and regularity instilled into me at a very early age.\r\n\r\nIn that happy bygone time, I was taught to keep my hair tidy at all\r\nhours of the day and night, and to fold up every article of my clothing\r\ncarefully, in the same order, on the same chair, in the same place at\r\nthe foot of the bed, before retiring to rest. An entry of the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevents in my little diary invariably preceded the folding up. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvening Hymn\xe2\x80\x9d (repeated in bed) invariably followed the folding up.\r\nAnd the sweet sleep of childhood invariably followed the \xe2\x80\x9cEvening\r\nHymn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn later life (alas!) the Hymn has been succeeded by sad and bitter\r\nmeditations; and the sweet sleep has been but ill exchanged for the\r\nbroken slumbers which haunt the uneasy pillow of care. On the other\r\nhand, I have continued to fold my clothes, and to keep my little diary.\r\nThe former habit links me to my happy childhood\xe2\x80\x94before papa was ruined.\r\nThe latter habit\xe2\x80\x94hitherto mainly useful in helping me to discipline the\r\nfallen nature which we all inherit from Adam\xe2\x80\x94has unexpectedly proved\r\nimportant to my humble interests in quite another way. It has enabled\r\npoor Me to serve the caprice of a wealthy member of the family into\r\nwhich my late uncle married. I am fortunate enough to be useful to Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake.\r\n\r\nI have been cut off from all news of my relatives by marriage for some\r\ntime past. When we are isolated and poor, we are not infrequently\r\nforgotten. I am now living, for economy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, in a little town in\r\nBrittany, inhabited by a select circle of serious English friends, and\r\npossessed of the inestimable advantages of a Protestant clergyman and a\r\ncheap market.\r\n\r\nIn this retirement\xe2\x80\x94a Patmos amid the howling ocean of popery that\r\nsurrounds us\xe2\x80\x94a letter from England has reached me at last. I find my\r\ninsignificant existence suddenly remembered by Mr. Franklin Blake. My\r\nwealthy relative\xe2\x80\x94would that I could add my spiritually-wealthy\r\nrelative!\xe2\x80\x94writes, without even an attempt at disguising that he wants\r\nsomething of me. The whim has seized him to stir up the deplorable\r\nscandal of the Moonstone: and I am to help him by writing the account\r\nof what I myself witnessed while visiting at Aunt Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house in\r\nLondon. Pecuniary remuneration is offered to me\xe2\x80\x94with the want of\r\nfeeling peculiar to the rich. I am to re-open wounds that Time has\r\nbarely closed; I am to recall the most intensely painful\r\nremembrances\xe2\x80\x94and this done, I am to feel myself compensated by a new\r\nlaceration, in the shape of Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s cheque. My nature is weak. It\r\ncost me a hard struggle, before Christian humility conquered sinful\r\npride, and self-denial accepted the cheque.\r\n\r\nWithout my diary, I doubt\xe2\x80\x94pray let me express it in the grossest\r\nterms!\xe2\x80\x94if I could have honestly earned my money. With my diary, the\r\npoor labourer (who forgives Mr. Blake for insulting her) is worthy of\r\nher hire. Nothing escaped me at the time I was visiting dear Aunt\r\nVerinder. Everything was entered (thanks to my early training) day by\r\nday as it happened; and everything down to the smallest particular,\r\nshall be told here. My sacred regard for truth is (thank God) far above\r\nmy respect for persons. It will be easy for Mr. Blake to suppress what\r\nmay not prove to be sufficiently flattering in these pages to the\r\nperson chiefly concerned in them. He has purchased my time, but not\r\neven _his_ wealth can purchase my conscience too.*\r\n\r\n[*Note. _Added by Franklin Blake._\xe2\x80\x94Miss Clack may make her mind quite\r\neasy on this point. Nothing will be added, altered or removed, in her\r\nmanuscript, or in any of the other manuscripts which pass through my\r\nhands.

The\r\nperson who answered the door, informed me that my aunt and her daughter\r\n(I really cannot call her my cousin!) had arrived from the country a\r\nweek since, and meditated making some stay in London. I sent up a\r\nmessage at once, declining to disturb them, and only begging to know\r\nwhether I could be of any use.\r\n\r\nThe person who answered the door, took my message in insolent silence,\r\nand left me standing in the hall. She is the daughter of a heathen old\r\nman named Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94long, too long, tolerated in my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s family. I\r\nsat down in the hall to wait for my answer\xe2\x80\x94and, having always a few\r\ntracts in my bag, I selected one which proved to be quite\r\nprovidentially applicable to the person who answered the door. The hall\r\nwas dirty, and the chair was hard; but the blessed consciousness of\r\nreturning good for evil raised me quite above any trifling\r\nconsiderations of that kind. The tract was one of a series addressed to\r\nyoung women on the sinfulness of dress. In style it was devoutly\r\nfamiliar. Its title was, \xe2\x80\x9cA Word With You On Your Cap-Ribbons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lady is much obliged, and begs you will come and lunch tomorrow at\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI passed over the manner in which she gave her message, and the\r\ndreadful boldness of her look. I thanked this young castaway; and I\r\nsaid, in a tone of Christian interest, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you favour me by accepting\r\na tract?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at the title. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it written by a man or a woman, Miss? If\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s written by a woman, I had rather not read it on that account. If\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s written by a man, I beg to inform him that he knows nothing about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d She handed me back the tract, and opened the door. We must sow the\r\ngood seed somehow. I waited till the door was shut on me, and slipped\r\nthe tract into the letter-box. When I had dropped another tract through\r\nthe area railings, I felt relieved, in some small degree, of a heavy\r\nresponsibility towards others.\r\n\r\nWe had a meeting that evening of the Select Committee of the\r\nMothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes-Conversion-Society. The object of this excellent\r\nCharity is\xe2\x80\x94as all serious people know\xe2\x80\x94to rescue unredeemed fathers\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntrousers from the pawnbroker, and to prevent their resumption, on the\r\npart of the irreclaimable parent, by abridging them immediately to suit\r\nthe proportions of the innocent son. I was a member, at that time, of\r\nthe select committee; and I mention the Society here, because my\r\nprecious and admirable friend, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite, was associated\r\nwith our work of moral and material usefulness. I had expected to see\r\nhim in the boardroom, on the Monday evening of which I am now writing,\r\nand had proposed to tell him, when we met, of dear Aunt Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival in London. To my great disappointment he never appeared. On my\r\nexpressing a feeling of surprise at his absence, my sisters of the\r\nCommittee all looked up together from their trousers (we had a great\r\npressure of business that night), and asked in amazement, if I had not\r\nheard the news. I acknowledged my ignorance, and was then told, for the\r\nfirst time, of an event which forms, so to speak, the starting-point of\r\nthis narrative. On the previous Friday, two gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94occupying\r\nwidely-different positions in society\xe2\x80\x94had been the victims of an\r\noutrage which had startled all London. One of the gentlemen was Mr.\r\nSeptimus Luker, of Lambeth. The other was Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\r\n\r\nLiving in my present isolation, I have no means of introducing the\r\nnewspaper-account of the outrage into my narrative. I was also\r\ndeprived, at the time, of the inestimable advantage of hearing the\r\nevents related by the fervid eloquence of Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite. All I\r\ncan do is to state the facts as they were stated, on that Monday\r\nevening, to me; proceeding on the plan which I have been taught from\r\ninfancy to adopt in folding up my clothes. Everything shall be put\r\nneatly, and everything shall be put in its place. These lines are\r\nwritten by a poor weak woman. From a poor weak woman who will be cruel\r\nenough to expect more?\r\n\r\nThe date\xe2\x80\x94thanks to my dear parents, no dictionary that ever was written\r\ncan be more particular than I am about dates\xe2\x80\x94was Friday, June 30th,\r\n1848.\r\n\r\nEarly on that memorable day, our gifted Mr. Godfrey happened to be\r\ncashing a cheque at a banking-house in Lombard Street. The name of the\r\nfirm is accidentally blotted in my diary, and my sacred regard for\r\ntruth forbids me to hazard a guess in a matter of this kind.\r\nFortunately, the name of the firm doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. What does matter is a\r\ncircumstance that occurred when Mr. Godfrey had transacted his\r\nbusiness. On gaining the door, he encountered a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94a perfect\r\nstranger to him\xe2\x80\x94who was accidentally leaving the office exactly at the\r\nsame time as himself. A momentary contest of politeness ensued between\r\nthem as to who should be the first to pass through the door of the\r\nbank. The stranger insisted on making Mr. Godfrey precede him; Mr.\r\nGodfrey said a few civil words; they bowed, and parted in the street.\r\n\r\nThoughtless and superficial people may say, Here is surely a very\r\ntrumpery little incident related in an absurdly circumstantial manner.\r\nOh, my young friends and fellow-sinners! beware of presuming to\r\nexercise your poor carnal reason. Oh, be morally tidy. Let your faith\r\nbe as your stockings, and your stockings as your faith. Both ever\r\nspotless, and both ready to put on at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice!\r\n\r\nI beg a thousand pardons. I have fallen insensibly into my\r\nSunday-school style. Most inappropriate in such a record as this. Let\r\nme try to be worldly\xe2\x80\x94let me say that trifles, in this case as in many\r\nothers, led to terrible results. Merely premising that the polite\r\nstranger was Mr. Luker, of Lambeth, we will now follow Mr. Godfrey home\r\nto his residence at Kilburn.\r\n\r\nHe found waiting for him, in the hall, a poorly clad but delicate and\r\ninteresting-looking little boy. The boy handed him a letter, merely\r\nmentioning that he had been entrusted with it by an old lady whom he\r\ndid not know, and who had given him no instructions to wait for an\r\nanswer. Such incidents as these were not uncommon in Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge experience as a promoter of public charities. He let the boy go,\r\nand opened the letter.\r\n\r\nThe handwriting was entirely unfamiliar to him. It requested his\r\nattendance, within an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, at a house in Northumberland Street,\r\nStrand, which he had never had occasion to enter before. The object\r\nsought was to obtain from the worthy manager certain details on the\r\nsubject of the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes-Conversion-Society, and the\r\ninformation was wanted by an elderly lady who proposed adding largely\r\nto the resources of the charity, if her questions were met by\r\nsatisfactory replies. She mentioned her name, and she added that the\r\nshortness of her stay in London prevented her from giving any longer\r\nnotice to the eminent philanthropist whom she addressed.\r\n\r\nOrdinary people might have hesitated before setting aside their own\r\nengagements to suit the convenience of a stranger. The Christian Hero\r\nnever hesitates where good is to be done. Mr. Godfrey instantly turned\r\nback, and proceeded to the house in Northumberland Street. A most\r\nrespectable though somewhat corpulent man answered the door, and, on\r\nhearing Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s name, immediately conducted him into an empty\r\napartment at the back, on the drawing-room floor. He noticed two\r\nunusual things on entering the room. One of them was a faint odour of\r\nmusk and camphor. The other was an ancient Oriental manuscript, richly\r\nilluminated with Indian figures and devices, that lay open to\r\ninspection on a table.\r\n\r\nHe was looking at the book, the position of which caused him to stand\r\nwith his back turned towards the closed folding doors communicating\r\nwith the front room, when, without the slightest previous noise to warn\r\nhim, he felt himself suddenly seized round the neck from behind. He had\r\njust time to notice that the arm round his neck was naked and of a\r\ntawny-brown colour, before his eyes were bandaged, his mouth was\r\ngagged, and he was thrown helpless on the floor by (as he judged) two\r\nmen. A third rifled his pockets, and\xe2\x80\x94if, as a lady, I may venture to\r\nuse such an expression\xe2\x80\x94searched him, without ceremony, through and\r\nthrough to his skin.\r\n\r\nHere I should greatly enjoy saying a few cheering words on the devout\r\nconfidence which could alone have sustained Mr. Godfrey in an emergency\r\nso terrible as this. Perhaps, however, the position and appearance of\r\nmy admirable friend at the culminating period of the outrage (as above\r\ndescribed) are hardly within the proper limits of female discussion.\r\nLet me pass over the next few moments, and return to Mr. Godfrey at the\r\ntime when the odious search of his person had been completed. The\r\noutrage had been perpetrated throughout in dead silence. At the end of\r\nit some words were exchanged, among the invisible wretches, in a\r\nlanguage which he did not understand, but in tones which were plainly\r\nexpressive (to his cultivated ear) of disappointment and rage. He was\r\nsuddenly lifted from the ground, placed in a chair, and bound there\r\nhand and foot. The next moment he felt the air flowing in from the open\r\ndoor, listened, and concluded that he was alone again in the room.\r\n\r\nAn interval elapsed, and he heard a sound below like the rustling sound\r\nof a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress. It advanced up the stairs, and stopped. A female\r\nscream rent the atmosphere of guilt. A man\xe2\x80\x99s voice below exclaimed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d A man\xe2\x80\x99s feet ascended the stairs. Mr. Godfrey felt Christian\r\nfingers unfastening his bandage, and extracting his gag. He looked in\r\namazement at two respectable strangers, and faintly articulated, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d The two respectable strangers looked back, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly the question we were going to ask _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inevitable explanation followed. No! Let me be scrupulously\r\nparticular. Sal volatile and water followed, to compose dear Mr.\r\nGodfrey\xe2\x80\x99s nerves. The explanation came next.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from the statement of the landlord and landlady of the\r\nhouse (persons of good repute in the neighbourhood), that their first\r\nand second floor apartments had been engaged, on the previous day, for\r\na week certain, by a most respectable-looking gentleman\xe2\x80\x94the same who\r\nhas been already described as answering the door to Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknock. The gentleman had paid the week\xe2\x80\x99s rent and all the week\xe2\x80\x99s extras\r\nin advance, stating that the apartments were wanted for three Oriental\r\nnoblemen, friends of his, who were visiting England for the first time.\r\nEarly on the morning of the outrage, two of the Oriental strangers,\r\naccompanied by their respectable English friend, took possession of the\r\napartments. The third was expected to join them shortly; and the\r\nluggage (reported as very bulky) was announced to follow when it had\r\npassed through the Custom-house, late in the afternoon. Not more than\r\nten minutes previous to Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s visit, the third foreigner had\r\narrived. Nothing out of the common had happened, to the knowledge of\r\nthe landlord and landlady downstairs, until within the last five\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x94when they had seen the three foreigners, accompanied by their\r\nrespectable English friend, all leave the house together, walking\r\nquietly in the direction of the Strand. Remembering that a visitor had\r\ncalled, and not having seen the visitor also leave the house, the\r\nlandlady had thought it rather strange that the gentleman should be\r\nleft by himself upstairs. After a short discussion with her husband,\r\nshe had considered it advisable to ascertain whether anything was\r\nwrong. The result had followed, as I have already attempted to describe\r\nit; and there the explanation of the landlord and the landlady came to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nAn investigation was next made in the room. Dear Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s property\r\nwas found scattered in all directions. When the articles were\r\ncollected, however, nothing was missing; his watch, chain, purse, keys,\r\npocket-handkerchief, note-book, and all his loose papers had been\r\nclosely examined, and had then been left unharmed to be resumed by the\r\nowner. In the same way, not the smallest morsel of property belonging\r\nto the proprietors of the house had been abstracted. The Oriental\r\nnoblemen had removed their own illuminated manuscript, and had removed\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean? Taking the worldly point of view, it appeared to mean\r\nthat Mr. Godfrey had been the victim of some incomprehensible error,\r\ncommitted by certain unknown men. A dark conspiracy was on foot in the\r\nmidst of us; and our beloved and innocent friend had been entangled in\r\nits meshes. When the Christian hero of a hundred charitable victories\r\nplunges into a pitfall that has been dug for him by mistake, oh, what a\r\nwarning it is to the rest of us to be unceasingly on our guard! How\r\nsoon may our own evil passions prove to be Oriental noblemen who pounce\r\non us unawares!\r\n\r\nI could write pages of affectionate warning on this one theme, but\r\n(alas!) I am not permitted to improve\xe2\x80\x94I am condemned to narrate. My\r\nwealthy relative\xe2\x80\x99s cheque\xe2\x80\x94henceforth, the incubus of my existence\xe2\x80\x94warns\r\nme that I have not done with this record of violence yet. We must leave\r\nMr. Godfrey to recover in Northumberland Street, and must follow the\r\nproceedings of Mr. Luker at a later period of the day.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the bank, Mr. Luker had visited various parts of London\r\non business errands. Returning to his own residence, he found a letter\r\nwaiting for him, which was described as having been left a short time\r\npreviously by a boy. In this case, as in Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s case, the\r\nhandwriting was strange; but the name mentioned was the name of one of\r\nMr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s customers. His correspondent announced (writing in the\r\nthird person\xe2\x80\x94apparently by the hand of a deputy) that he had been\r\nunexpectedly summoned to London. He had just established himself in\r\nlodgings in Alfred Place, Tottenham Court Road; and he desired to see\r\nMr. Luker immediately, on the subject of a purchase which he\r\ncontemplated making. The gentleman was an enthusiastic collector of\r\nOriental antiquities, and had been for many years a liberal patron of\r\nthe establishment in Lambeth. Oh, when shall we wean ourselves from the\r\nworship of Mammon! Mr. Luker called a cab, and drove off instantly to\r\nhis liberal patron.\r\n\r\nExactly what had happened to Mr. Godfrey in Northumberland Street now\r\nhappened to Mr. Luker in Alfred Place. Once more the respectable man\r\nanswered the door, and showed the visitor upstairs into the back\r\ndrawing-room. There, again, lay the illuminated manuscript on a table.\r\nMr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s attention was absorbed, as Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s attention had been\r\nabsorbed, by this beautiful work of Indian art. He too was aroused from\r\nhis studies by a tawny naked arm round his throat, by a bandage over\r\nhis eyes, and by a gag in his mouth. He too was thrown prostrate and\r\nsearched to the skin. A longer interval had then elapsed than had\r\npassed in the experience of Mr. Godfrey; but it had ended as before, in\r\nthe persons of the house suspecting something wrong, and going upstairs\r\nto see what had happened. Precisely the same explanation which the\r\nlandlord in Northumberland Street had given to Mr. Godfrey, the\r\nlandlord in Alfred Place now gave to Mr. Luker. Both had been imposed\r\non in the same way by the plausible address and well-filled purse of\r\nthe respectable stranger, who introduced himself as acting for his\r\nforeign friends. The one point of difference between the two cases\r\noccurred when the scattered contents of Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s pockets were being\r\ncollected from the floor. His watch and purse were safe, but (less\r\nfortunate than Mr. Godfrey) one of the loose papers that he carried\r\nabout him had been taken away. The paper in question acknowledged the\r\nreceipt of a valuable of great price which Mr. Luker had that day left\r\nin the care of his bankers. This document would be useless for purposes\r\nof fraud, inasmuch as it provided that the valuable should only be\r\ngiven up on the personal application of the owner. As soon as he\r\nrecovered himself, Mr. Luker hurried to the bank, on the chance that\r\nthe thieves who had robbed him might ignorantly present themselves with\r\nthe receipt. Nothing had been seen of them when he arrived at the\r\nestablishment, and nothing was seen of them afterwards. Their\r\nrespectable English friend had (in the opinion of the bankers) looked\r\nthe receipt over before they attempted to make use of it, and had given\r\nthem the necessary warning in good time.\r\n\r\nInformation of both outrages was communicated to the police, and the\r\nneedful investigations were pursued, I believe, with great energy. The\r\nauthorities held that a robbery had been planned, on insufficient\r\ninformation received by the thieves. They had been plainly not sure\r\nwhether Mr. Luker had, or had not, trusted the transmission of his\r\nprecious gem to another person; and poor polite Mr. Godfrey had paid\r\nthe penalty of having been seen accidentally speaking to him. Add to\r\nthis, that Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s absence from our Monday evening meeting had\r\nbeen occasioned by a consultation of the authorities, at which he was\r\nrequested to assist\xe2\x80\x94and all the explanations required being now given,\r\nI may proceed with the simpler story of my own little personal\r\nexperiences in Montagu Square.\r\n\r\nI was punctual to the luncheon hour on Tuesday. Reference to my diary\r\nshows this to have been a chequered day\xe2\x80\x94much in it to be devoutly\r\nregretted, much in it to be devoutly thankful for.\r\n\r\nDear Aunt Verinder received me with her usual grace and kindness. But I\r\nnoticed, after a little while, that something was wrong. Certain\r\nanxious looks escaped my aunt, all of which took the direction of her\r\ndaughter. I never see Rachel myself without wondering how it can be\r\nthat so insignificant-looking a person should be the child of such\r\ndistinguished parents as Sir John and Lady Verinder. On this occasion,\r\nhowever, she not only disappointed\xe2\x80\x94she really shocked me. There was an\r\nabsence of all lady-like restraint in her language and manner most\r\npainful to see. She was possessed by some feverish excitement which\r\nmade her distressingly loud when she laughed, and sinfully wasteful and\r\ncapricious in what she ate and drank at lunch. I felt deeply for her\r\npoor mother, even before the true state of the case had been\r\nconfidentially made known to me.\r\n\r\nLuncheon over, my aunt said: \xe2\x80\x9cRemember what the doctor told you,\r\nRachel, about quieting yourself with a book after taking your meals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go into the library, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if Godfrey calls,\r\nmind I am told of it. I am dying for more news of him, after his\r\nadventure in Northumberland Street.\xe2\x80\x9d She kissed her mother on the\r\nforehead, and looked my way. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Clack,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, carelessly.\r\nHer insolence roused no angry feeling in me; I only made a private\r\nmemorandum to pray for her.\r\n\r\nWhen we were left by ourselves, my aunt told me the whole horrible\r\nstory of the Indian Diamond, which, I am happy to know, it is not\r\nnecessary to repeat here. She did not conceal from me that she would\r\nhave preferred keeping silence on the subject. But when her own\r\nservants all knew of the loss of the Moonstone, and when some of the\r\ncircumstances had actually found their way into the newspapers\xe2\x80\x94when\r\nstrangers were speculating whether there was any connection between\r\nwhat had happened at Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s country house, and what had\r\nhappened in Northumberland Street and Alfred Place\xe2\x80\x94concealment was not\r\nto be thought of; and perfect frankness became a necessity as well as a\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nSome persons, hearing what I now heard, would have been probably\r\noverwhelmed with astonishment. For my own part, knowing Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s spirit\r\nto have been essentially unregenerate from her childhood upwards, I was\r\nprepared for whatever my aunt could tell me on the subject of her\r\ndaughter. It might have gone on from bad to worse till it ended in\r\nMurder; and I should still have said to myself, The natural result! oh,\r\ndear, dear, the natural result! The one thing that _did_ shock me was\r\nthe course my aunt had taken under the circumstances. Here surely was a\r\ncase for a clergyman, if ever there was one yet! Lady Verinder had\r\nthought it a case for a physician. All my poor aunt\xe2\x80\x99s early life had\r\nbeen passed in her father\xe2\x80\x99s godless household. The natural result\r\nagain! Oh, dear, dear, the natural result again!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors recommend plenty of exercise and amusement for Rachel, and\r\nstrongly urge me to keep her mind as much as possible from dwelling on\r\nthe past,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Verinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what heathen advice!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this Christian\r\ncountry, what heathen advice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy aunt went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI do my best to carry out my instructions. But this\r\nstrange adventure of Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s happens at a most unfortunate time.\r\nRachel has been incessantly restless and excited since she first heard\r\nof it. She left me no peace till I had written and asked my nephew\r\nAblewhite to come here. She even feels an interest in the other person\r\nwho was roughly used\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Luker, or some such name\xe2\x80\x94though the man is, of\r\ncourse, a total stranger to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour knowledge of the world, dear aunt, is superior to mine,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsuggested diffidently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there must be a reason surely for this\r\nextraordinary conduct on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s part. She is keeping a sinful secret\r\nfrom you and from everybody. May there not be something in these recent\r\nevents which threatens her secret with discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscovery?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you possibly mean? Discovery\r\nthrough Mr. Luker? Discovery through my nephew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the word passed her lips, a special providence occurred. The servant\r\nopened the door, and announced Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey followed the announcement of his name\xe2\x80\x94as Mr. Godfrey does\r\neverything else\xe2\x80\x94exactly at the right time. He was not so close on the\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s heels as to startle us. He was not so far behind as to cause\r\nus the double inconvenience of a pause and an open door. It is in the\r\ncompleteness of his daily life that the true Christian appears. This\r\ndear man was very complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Miss Verinder,\xe2\x80\x9d said my aunt, addressing the servant, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell\r\nher Mr. Ablewhite is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe both inquired after his health. We both asked him together whether\r\nhe felt like himself again, after his terrible adventure of the past\r\nweek. With perfect tact, he contrived to answer us at the same moment.\r\nLady Verinder had his reply in words. I had his charming smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, with infinite tenderness, \xe2\x80\x9chave I done to deserve all\r\nthis sympathy? My dear aunt! my dear Miss Clack! I have merely been\r\nmistaken for somebody else. I have only been blindfolded; I have only\r\nbeen strangled; I have only been thrown flat on my back, on a very thin\r\ncarpet, covering a particularly hard floor. Just think how much worse\r\nit might have been! I might have been murdered; I might have been\r\nrobbed. What have I lost? Nothing but Nervous Force\xe2\x80\x94which the law\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise as property; so that, strictly speaking, I have lost\r\nnothing at all. If I could have had my own way, I would have kept my\r\nadventure to myself\xe2\x80\x94I shrink from all this fuss and publicity. But Mr.\r\nLuker made _his_ injuries public, and _my_ injuries, as the necessary\r\nconsequence, have been proclaimed in their turn. I have become the\r\nproperty of the newspapers, until the gentle reader gets sick of the\r\nsubject. I am very sick indeed of it myself. May the gentle reader soon\r\nbe like me! And how is dear Rachel? Still enjoying the gaieties of\r\nLondon? So glad to hear it! Miss Clack, I need all your indulgence. I\r\nam sadly behind-hand with my Committee Work and my dear Ladies. But I\r\nreally do hope to look in at the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes next week. Did\r\nyou make cheering progress at Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Committee? Was the Board hopeful\r\nabout future prospects? And are we nicely off for Trousers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe heavenly gentleness of his smile made his apologies irresistible.\r\nThe richness of his deep voice added its own indescribable charm to the\r\ninteresting business question which he had just addressed to me. In\r\ntruth, we were almost _too_ nicely off for Trousers; we were quite\r\noverwhelmed by them. I was just about to say so, when the door opened\r\nagain, and an element of worldly disturbance entered the room, in the\r\nperson of Miss Verinder.\r\n\r\nShe approached dear Mr. Godfrey at a most unladylike rate of speed,\r\nwith her hair shockingly untidy, and her face, what _I_ should call,\r\nunbecomingly flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am charmed to see you, Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing him, I grieve\r\nto add, in the off-hand manner of one young man talking to another. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish you had brought Mr. Luker with you. You and he (as long as our\r\npresent excitement lasts) are the two most interesting men in all\r\nLondon. It\xe2\x80\x99s morbid to say this; it\xe2\x80\x99s unhealthy; it\xe2\x80\x99s all that a\r\nwell-regulated mind like Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x99s most instinctively shudders at.\r\nNever mind that. Tell me the whole of the Northumberland Street story\r\ndirectly. I know the newspapers have left some of it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven dear Mr. Godfrey partakes of the fallen nature which we all\r\ninherit from Adam\xe2\x80\x94it is a very small share of our human legacy, but,\r\nalas! he has it. I confess it grieved me to see him take Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nin both of his own hands, and lay it softly on the left side of his\r\nwaistcoat. It was a direct encouragement to her reckless way of\r\ntalking, and her insolent reference to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the same voice which had thrilled me when\r\nhe spoke of our prospects and our trousers, \xe2\x80\x9cthe newspapers have told\r\nyou everything\xe2\x80\x94and they have told it much better than I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodfrey thinks we all make too much of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d my aunt remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just been saying that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care to speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put the question with a sudden flash in her eyes, and a sudden look\r\nup into Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s face. On his side, he looked down at her with an\r\nindulgence so injudicious and so ill-deserved, that I really felt\r\ncalled on to interfere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d I remonstrated gently, \xe2\x80\x9ctrue greatness and true\r\ncourage are ever modest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a very good fellow in your way, Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94not taking\r\nthe smallest notice, observe, of me, and still speaking to her cousin\r\nas if she was one young man addressing another. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am quite sure\r\nyou are not great; I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you possess any extraordinary\r\ncourage; and I am firmly persuaded\xe2\x80\x94if you ever had any modesty\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyour lady-worshippers relieved you of that virtue a good many years\r\nsince. You have some private reason for not talking of your adventure\r\nin Northumberland Street; and I mean to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy reason is the simplest imaginable, and the most easily\r\nacknowledged,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, still bearing with her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am tired of the\r\nsubject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tired of the subject? My dear Godfrey, I am going to make a\r\nremark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live a great deal too much in the society of women. And you have\r\ncontracted two very bad habits in consequence. You have learnt to talk\r\nnonsense seriously, and you have got into a way of telling fibs for the\r\npleasure of telling them. You can\xe2\x80\x99t go straight with your\r\nlady-worshippers. I mean to make you go straight with _me_. Come, and\r\nsit down. I am brimful of downright questions; and I expect you to be\r\nbrimful of downright answers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe actually dragged him across the room to a chair by the window,\r\nwhere the light would fall on his face. I deeply feel being obliged to\r\nreport such language, and to describe such conduct. But, hemmed in, as\r\nI am, between Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s cheque on one side and my own sacred\r\nregard for truth on the other, what am I to do? I looked at my aunt.\r\nShe sat unmoved; apparently in no way disposed to interfere. I had\r\nnever noticed this kind of torpor in her before. It was, perhaps, the\r\nreaction after the trying time she had had in the country. Not a\r\npleasant symptom to remark, be it what it might, at dear Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s age, and with dear Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s autumnal exuberance of\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Rachel had settled herself at the window with our\r\namiable and forbearing\xe2\x80\x94our too forbearing\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Godfrey. She began the\r\nstring of questions with which she had threatened him, taking no more\r\nnotice of her mother, or of myself, than if we had not been in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the police done anything, Godfrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certain, I suppose, that the three men who laid the trap for you\r\nwere the same three men who afterwards laid the trap for Mr. Luker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumanly speaking, my dear Rachel, there can be no doubt of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not a trace of them has been discovered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a trace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is thought\xe2\x80\x94is it not?\xe2\x80\x94that these three men are the three Indians\r\nwho came to our house in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Rachel, they blindfolded me before I could see their faces. I\r\nknow nothing whatever of the matter. How can I offer an opinion on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven the angelic gentleness of Mr. Godfrey was, you see, beginning to\r\ngive way at last under the persecution inflicted on him. Whether\r\nunbridled curiosity, or ungovernable dread, dictated Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestions I do not presume to inquire. I only report that, on Mr.\r\nGodfrey\xe2\x80\x99s attempting to rise, after giving her the answer just\r\ndescribed, she actually took him by the two shoulders, and pushed him\r\nback into his chair\xe2\x80\x94Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say this was immodest! don\xe2\x80\x99t even hint\r\nthat the recklessness of guilty terror could alone account for such\r\nconduct as I have described! We must not judge others. My Christian\r\nfriends, indeed, indeed, indeed, we must not judge others!\r\n\r\nShe went on with her questions, unabashed. Earnest Biblical students\r\nwill perhaps be reminded\xe2\x80\x94as I was reminded\xe2\x80\x94of the blinded children of\r\nthe devil, who went on with their orgies, unabashed, in the time before\r\nthe Flood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know something about Mr. Luker, Godfrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am again unfortunate, Rachel. No man knows less of Mr. Luker than I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never saw him before you and he met accidentally at the bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen him since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. We have been examined together, as well as separately, to assist\r\nthe police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Luker was robbed of a receipt which he had got from his\r\nbanker\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94was he not? What was the receipt for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a valuable gem which he had placed in the safe keeping of the\r\nbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what the newspapers say. It may be enough for the general\r\nreader; but it is not enough for me. The banker\xe2\x80\x99s receipt must have\r\nmentioned what the gem was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe banker\xe2\x80\x99s receipt, Rachel\xe2\x80\x94as I have heard it described\xe2\x80\x94mentioned\r\nnothing of the kind. A valuable gem, belonging to Mr. Luker; deposited\r\nby Mr. Luker; sealed with Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s seal; and only to be given up on\r\nMr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s personal application. That was the form, and that is all I\r\nknow about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment, after he had said that. She looked at her mother,\r\nand sighed. She looked back again at Mr. Godfrey, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of our private affairs, at home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cseem to have got\r\ninto the newspapers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grieve to say, it is so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd some idle people, perfect strangers to us, are trying to trace a\r\nconnexion between what happened at our house in Yorkshire and what has\r\nhappened since, here in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe public curiosity, in certain quarters, is, I fear, taking that\r\nturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people who say that the three unknown men who ill-used you and Mr.\r\nLuker are the three Indians, also say that the valuable gem\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere she stopped. She had become gradually, within the last few\r\nmoments, whiter and whiter in the face. The extraordinary blackness of\r\nher hair made this paleness, by contrast, so ghastly to look at, that\r\nwe all thought she would faint, at the moment when she checked herself\r\nin the middle of her question. Dear Mr. Godfrey made a second attempt\r\nto leave his chair. My aunt entreated her to say no more. I followed my\r\naunt with a modest medicinal peace-offering, in the shape of a bottle\r\nof salts. We none of us produced the slightest effect on her. \xe2\x80\x9cGodfrey,\r\nstay where you are. Mamma, there is not the least reason to be alarmed\r\nabout me. Clack, you\xe2\x80\x99re dying to hear the end of it\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t faint,\r\nexpressly to oblige _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were the exact words she used\xe2\x80\x94taken down in my diary the moment I\r\ngot home. But, oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us judge! My Christian friends, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nus judge!\r\n\r\nShe turned once more to Mr. Godfrey. With an obstinacy dreadful to see,\r\nshe went back again to the place where she had checked herself, and\r\ncompleted her question in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to you, a minute since, about what people were saying in\r\ncertain quarters. Tell me plainly, Godfrey, do they any of them say\r\nthat Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s valuable gem is\xe2\x80\x94the Moonstone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the name of the Indian Diamond passed her lips, I saw a change come\r\nover my admirable friend. His complexion deepened. He lost the genial\r\nsuavity of manner which is one of his greatest charms. A noble\r\nindignation inspired his reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey _do_ say it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are people who don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate\r\nto accuse Mr. Luker of telling a falsehood to serve some private\r\ninterests of his own. He has over and over again solemnly declared\r\nthat, until this scandal assailed him, he had never even heard of the\r\nMoonstone. And these vile people reply, without a shadow of proof to\r\njustify them, He has his reasons for concealment; we decline to believe\r\nhim on his oath. Shameful! shameful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel looked at him very strangely\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t well describe how\xe2\x80\x94while he\r\nwas speaking. When he had done, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering that Mr. Luker\r\nis only a chance acquaintance of yours, you take up his cause, Godfrey,\r\nrather warmly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy gifted friend made her one of the most truly evangelical answers I\r\never heard in my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Rachel, I take up the cause of all oppressed people rather\r\nwarmly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe tone in which those words were spoken might have melted a stone.\r\nBut, oh dear, what is the hardness of stone? Nothing, compared to the\r\nhardness of the unregenerate human heart! She sneered. I blush to\r\nrecord it\xe2\x80\x94she sneered at him to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your noble sentiments for your Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Committees, Godfrey. I am\r\ncertain that the scandal which has assailed Mr. Luker, has not spared\r\nYou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s torpor was roused by those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d she remonstrated, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have really no right to say\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean no harm, mamma\xe2\x80\x94I mean good. Have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s patience with me,\r\nand you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked back at Mr. Godfrey, with what appeared to be a sudden pity\r\nfor him. She went the length\xe2\x80\x94the very unladylike length\xe2\x80\x94of taking him\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have found out the true reason of\r\nyour unwillingness to speak of this matter before my mother and before\r\nme. An unlucky accident has associated you in people\xe2\x80\x99s minds with Mr.\r\nLuker. You have told me what scandal says of _him_. What does scandal\r\nsay of _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven at the eleventh hour, dear Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x94always ready to return good\r\nfor evil\xe2\x80\x94tried to spare her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better forgotten, Rachel\xe2\x80\x94it is, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _will_ hear it!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out, fiercely, at the top of her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her, Godfrey!\xe2\x80\x9d entreated my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing can do her such harm\r\nas your silence is doing now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s fine eyes filled with tears. He cast one last appealing\r\nlook at her\xe2\x80\x94and then he spoke the fatal words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will have it, Rachel\xe2\x80\x94scandal says that the Moonstone is in\r\npledge to Mr. Luker, and that I am the man who has pawned it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet with a scream. She looked backwards and\r\nforwards from Mr. Godfrey to my aunt, and from my aunt to Mr. Godfrey,\r\nin such a frantic manner that I really thought she had gone mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t touch me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, shrinking back from\r\nall of us (I declare like some hunted animal!) into a corner of the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my fault! I must set it right. I have sacrificed\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94I had a right to do that, if I liked. But to let an innocent man\r\nbe ruined; to keep a secret which destroys his character for life\xe2\x80\x94Oh,\r\ngood God, it\xe2\x80\x99s too horrible! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy aunt half rose from her chair, then suddenly sat down again. She\r\ncalled to me faintly, and pointed to a little phial in her work-box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cSix drops, in water. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let Rachel see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances, I should have thought this strange. There\r\nwas no time now to think\xe2\x80\x94there was only time to give the medicine. Dear\r\nMr. Godfrey unconsciously assisted me in concealing what I was about\r\nfrom Rachel, by speaking composing words to her at the other end of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, indeed, you exaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard him say. \xe2\x80\x9cMy reputation\r\nstands too high to be destroyed by a miserable passing scandal like\r\nthis. It will be all forgotten in another week. Let us never speak of\r\nit again.\xe2\x80\x9d She was perfectly inaccessible, even to such generosity as\r\nthis. She went on from bad to worse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, and will, stop it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma! hear what I say. Miss\r\nClack! hear what I say. I know the hand that took the Moonstone. I\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she laid a strong emphasis on the words; she stamped her foot in\r\nthe rage that possessed her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_I know that Godfrey Ablewhite is\r\ninnocent!_ Take me to the magistrate, Godfrey! Take me to the\r\nmagistrate, and I will swear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy aunt caught me by the hand, and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cStand between us for a\r\nminute or two. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let Rachel see me.\xe2\x80\x9d I noticed a bluish tinge in\r\nher face which alarmed me. She saw I was startled. \xe2\x80\x9cThe drops will put\r\nme right in a minute or two,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and so closed her eyes, and\r\nwaited a little.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, I heard dear Mr. Godfrey still gently\r\nremonstrating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not appear publicly in such a thing as this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ reputation, dearest Rachel, is something too pure and too\r\nsacred to be trifled with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ reputation!\xe2\x80\x9d She burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I am accused, Godfrey,\r\nas well as you. The best detective officer in England declares that I\r\nhave stolen my own Diamond. Ask him what he thinks\xe2\x80\x94and he will tell you\r\nthat I have pledged the Moonstone to pay my private debts!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped, ran across the room\xe2\x80\x94and fell on her knees at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet. \xe2\x80\x9cOh mamma! mamma! mamma! I must be mad\xe2\x80\x94mustn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x94not to own the\r\ntruth _now!_\xe2\x80\x9d She was too vehement to notice her mother\xe2\x80\x99s condition\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas on her feet again, and back with Mr. Godfrey, in an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let you\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t let any innocent man\xe2\x80\x94be accused and disgraced\r\nthrough my fault. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t take me before the magistrate, draw out\r\na declaration of your innocence on paper, and I will sign it. Do as I\r\ntell you, Godfrey, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll write it to the newspapers I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out, and\r\ncry it in the streets!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe will not say this was the language of remorse\xe2\x80\x94we will say it was the\r\nlanguage of hysterics. Indulgent Mr. Godfrey pacified her by taking a\r\nsheet of paper, and drawing out the declaration. She signed it in a\r\nfeverish hurry. \xe2\x80\x9cShow it everywhere\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think of _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as\r\nshe gave it to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, Godfrey, I have not done you justice,\r\nhitherto, in my thoughts. You are more unselfish\xe2\x80\x94you are a better man\r\nthan I believed you to be. Come here when you can, and I will try and\r\nrepair the wrong I have done you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand. Alas, for our fallen nature! Alas, for Mr.\r\nGodfrey! He not only forgot himself so far as to kiss her hand\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nadopted a gentleness of tone in answering her which, in such a case,\r\nwas little better than a compromise with sin. \xe2\x80\x9cI will come, dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9con condition that we don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of this hateful subject\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d Never had I seen and heard our Christian Hero to less advantage\r\nthan on this occasion.\r\n\r\nBefore another word could be said by anybody, a thundering knock at the\r\nstreet door startled us all. I looked through the window, and saw the\r\nWorld, the Flesh, and the Devil waiting before the house\xe2\x80\x94as typified in\r\na carriage and horses, a powdered footman, and three of the most\r\naudaciously dressed women I ever beheld in my life.\r\n\r\nRachel started, and composed herself. She crossed the room to her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have come to take me to the flower-show,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne word,\r\nmamma, before I go. I have not distressed you, have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Is the bluntness of moral feeling which could ask such a question as\r\nthat, after what had just happened, to be pitied or condemned? I like\r\nto lean towards mercy. Let us pity it.)\r\n\r\nThe drops had produced their effect. My poor aunt\xe2\x80\x99s complexion was like\r\nitself again. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo with our friends, and\r\nenjoy yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer daughter stooped, and kissed her. I had left the window, and was\r\nnear the door, when Rachel approached it to go out. Another change had\r\ncome over her\xe2\x80\x94she was in tears. I looked with interest at the momentary\r\nsoftening of that obdurate heart. I felt inclined to say a few earnest\r\nwords. Alas! my well-meant sympathy only gave offence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nmean by pitying me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in a bitter whisper, as she passed to\r\nthe door. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see how happy I am? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the flower-show,\r\nClack; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the prettiest bonnet in London.\xe2\x80\x9d She completed the\r\nhollow mockery of that address by blowing me a kiss\xe2\x80\x94and so left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nI wish I could describe in words the compassion I felt for this\r\nmiserable and misguided girl. But I am almost as poorly provided with\r\nwords as with money. Permit me to say\xe2\x80\x94my heart bled for her.\r\n\r\nReturning to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s chair, I observed dear Mr. Godfrey searching for\r\nsomething softly, here and there, in different parts of the room.\r\nBefore I could offer to assist him he had found what he wanted. He came\r\nback to my aunt and me, with his declaration of innocence in one hand,\r\nand with a box of matches in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt, a little conspiracy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Clack, a pious\r\nfraud which even your high moral rectitude will excuse! Will you leave\r\nRachel to suppose that I accept the generous self-sacrifice which has\r\nsigned this paper? And will you kindly bear witness that I destroy it\r\nin your presence, before I leave the house?\xe2\x80\x9d He kindled a match, and,\r\nlighting the paper, laid it to burn in a plate on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cAny\r\ntrifling inconvenience that I may suffer is as nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompared with the importance of preserving that pure name from the\r\ncontaminating contact of the world. There! We have reduced it to a\r\nlittle harmless heap of ashes; and our dear impulsive Rachel will never\r\nknow what we have done! How do you feel? My precious friends, how do\r\nyou feel? For my poor part, I am as light-hearted as a boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe beamed on us with his beautiful smile; he held out a hand to my\r\naunt, and a hand to me. I was too deeply affected by his noble conduct\r\nto speak. I closed my eyes; I put his hand, in a kind of spiritual\r\nself-forgetfulness, to my lips. He murmured a soft remonstrance. Oh the\r\necstasy, the pure, unearthly ecstasy of that moment! I sat\xe2\x80\x94I hardly\r\nknow on what\xe2\x80\x94quite lost in my own exalted feelings. When I opened my\r\neyes again, it was like descending from heaven to earth. There was\r\nnobody but my aunt in the room. He had gone.\r\n\r\nI should like to stop here\xe2\x80\x94I should like to close my narrative with the\r\nrecord of Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s noble conduct. Unhappily there is more, much\r\nmore, which the unrelenting pecuniary pressure of Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s cheque\r\nobliges me to tell. The painful disclosures which were to reveal\r\nthemselves in my presence, during that Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Montagu\r\nSquare, were not at an end yet.\r\n\r\nFinding myself alone with Lady Verinder, I turned naturally to the\r\nsubject of her health; touching delicately on the strange anxiety which\r\nshe had shown to conceal her indisposition, and the remedy applied to\r\nit, from the observation of her daughter.\r\n\r\nMy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s reply greatly surprised me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrusilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said (if I have not already mentioned that my Christian\r\nname is Drusilla, permit me to mention it now), \xe2\x80\x9cyou are touching quite\r\ninnocently, I know\xe2\x80\x94on a very distressing subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose immediately. Delicacy left me but one alternative\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nalternative, after first making my apologies, of taking my leave. Lady\r\nVerinder stopped me, and insisted on my sitting down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have surprised a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I had confided to my\r\nsister Mrs. Ablewhite, and to my lawyer Mr. Bruff, and to no one else.\r\nI can trust in their discretion; and I am sure, when I tell you the\r\ncircumstances, I can trust in yours. Have you any pressing engagement,\r\nDrusilla? or is your time your own this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that my time was entirely at my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep me company then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor another hour. I have something\r\nto tell you which I believe you will be sorry to hear. And I shall have\r\na service to ask of you afterwards, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t object to assist me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is again needless to say that, so far from objecting, I was all\r\neagerness to assist her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can wait here,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9ctill Mr. Bruff comes at five. And\r\nyou can be one of the witnesses, Drusilla, when I sign my Will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer Will! I thought of the drops which I had seen in her work-box. I\r\nthought of the bluish tinge which I had noticed in her complexion. A\r\nlight which was not of this world\xe2\x80\x94a light shining prophetically from an\r\nunmade grave\xe2\x80\x94dawned on my mind. My aunt\xe2\x80\x99s secret was a secret no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nConsideration for poor Lady Verinder forbade me even to hint that I had\r\nguessed the melancholy truth, before she opened her lips. I waited her\r\npleasure in silence; and, having privately arranged to say a few\r\nsustaining words at the first convenient opportunity, felt prepared for\r\nany duty that could claim me, no matter how painful it might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been seriously ill, Drusilla, for some time past,\xe2\x80\x9d my aunt\r\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, strange to say, without knowing it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought of the thousands and thousands of perishing human creatures\r\nwho were all at that moment spiritually ill, without knowing it\r\nthemselves. And I greatly feared that my poor aunt might be one of the\r\nnumber. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought Rachel to London, as you know, for medical advice,\xe2\x80\x9d she went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it right to consult two doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo doctors! And, oh me (in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s state), not one clergyman! \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d I said once more. \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the two medical men,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded my aunt, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a stranger to me.\r\nThe other had been an old friend of my husband\xe2\x80\x99s, and had always felt a\r\nsincere interest in me for my husband\xe2\x80\x99s sake. After prescribing for\r\nRachel, he said he wished to speak to me privately in another room. I\r\nexpected, of course, to receive some special directions for the\r\nmanagement of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s health. To my surprise, he took me gravely\r\nby the hand, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I have been looking at you, Lady Verinder, with\r\na professional as well as a personal interest. You are, I am afraid,\r\nfar more urgently in need of medical advice than your daughter.\xe2\x80\x99 He put\r\nsome questions to me, which I was at first inclined to treat lightly\r\nenough, until I observed that my answers distressed him. It ended in\r\nhis making an appointment to come and see me, accompanied by a medical\r\nfriend, on the next day, at an hour when Rachel would not be at home.\r\nThe result of that visit\xe2\x80\x94most kindly and gently conveyed to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94satisfied both the physicians that there had been precious time\r\nlost, which could never be regained, and that my case had now passed\r\nbeyond the reach of their art. For more than two years I have been\r\nsuffering under an insidious form of heart disease, which, without any\r\nsymptoms to alarm me, has, by little and little, fatally broken me\r\ndown. I may live for some months, or I may die before another day has\r\npassed over my head\xe2\x80\x94the doctors cannot, and dare not, speak more\r\npositively than this. It would be vain to say, my dear, that I have not\r\nhad some miserable moments since my real situation has been made known\r\nto me. But I am more resigned than I was, and I am doing my best to set\r\nmy worldly affairs in order. My one great anxiety is that Rachel should\r\nbe kept in ignorance of the truth. If she knew it, she would at once\r\nattribute my broken health to anxiety about the Diamond, and would\r\nreproach herself bitterly, poor child, for what is in no sense her\r\nfault. Both the doctors agree that the mischief began two, if not three\r\nyears since. I am sure you will keep my secret, Drusilla\xe2\x80\x94for I am sure\r\nI see sincere sorrow and sympathy for me in your face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSorrow and sympathy! Oh, what Pagan emotions to expect from a Christian\r\nEnglishwoman anchored firmly on her faith!\r\n\r\nLittle did my poor aunt imagine what a gush of devout thankfulness\r\nthrilled through me as she approached the close of her melancholy\r\nstory. Here was a career of usefulness opened before me! Here was a\r\nbeloved relative and perishing fellow-creature, on the eve of the great\r\nchange, utterly unprepared; and led, providentially led, to reveal her\r\nsituation to Me! How can I describe the joy with which I now remembered\r\nthat the precious clerical friends on whom I could rely, were to be\r\ncounted, not by ones or twos, but by tens and twenties. I took my aunt\r\nin my arms\xe2\x80\x94my overflowing tenderness was not to be satisfied, _now_,\r\nwith anything less than an embrace. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d I said to her, fervently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe indescribable interest with which you inspire me! Oh! the good I\r\nmean to do you, dear, before we part!\xe2\x80\x9d After another word or two of\r\nearnest prefatory warning, I gave her her choice of three precious\r\nfriends, all plying the work of mercy from morning to night in her own\r\nneighbourhood; all equally inexhaustible in exhortation; all\r\naffectionately ready to exercise their gifts at a word from _me_. Alas!\r\nthe result was far from encouraging. Poor Lady Verinder looked puzzled\r\nand frightened, and met everything I could say to her with the purely\r\nworldly objection that she was not strong enough to face strangers. I\r\nyielded\xe2\x80\x94for the moment only, of course. My large experience (as Reader\r\nand Visitor, under not less, first and last, than fourteen beloved\r\nclerical friends) informed me that this was another case for\r\npreparation by books. I possessed a little library of works, all\r\nsuitable to the present emergency, all calculated to arouse, convince,\r\nprepare, enlighten, and fortify my aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will read, dear, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in my most winning way. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will read, if I bring you my\r\nown precious books? Turned down at all the right places, aunt. And\r\nmarked in pencil where you are to stop and ask yourself, \xe2\x80\x98Does this\r\napply to me?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Even that simple appeal\xe2\x80\x94so absolutely heathenising is\r\nthe influence of the world\xe2\x80\x94appeared to startle my aunt. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill do what I can, Drusilla, to please you,\xe2\x80\x9d with a look of surprise,\r\nwhich was at once instructive and terrible to see. Not a moment was to\r\nbe lost. The clock on the mantel-piece informed me that I had just time\r\nto hurry home; to provide myself with a first series of selected\r\nreadings (say a dozen only); and to return in time to meet the lawyer,\r\nand witness Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s Will. Promising faithfully to be back by\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I left the house on my errand of mercy.\r\n\r\nWhen no interests but my own are involved, I am humbly content to get\r\nfrom place to place by the omnibus. Permit me to give an idea of my\r\ndevotion to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s interests by recording that, on this occasion, I\r\ncommitted the prodigality of taking a cab.\r\n\r\nI drove home, selected and marked my first series of readings, and\r\ndrove back to Montagu Square, with a dozen works in a carpet-bag, the\r\nlike of which, I firmly believe, are not to be found in the literature\r\nof any other country in Europe. I paid the cabman exactly his fare. He\r\nreceived it with an oath; upon which I instantly gave him a tract. If I\r\nhad presented a pistol at his head, this abandoned wretch could hardly\r\nhave exhibited greater consternation. He jumped up on his box, and,\r\nwith profane exclamations of dismay, drove off furiously. Quite\r\nuseless, I am happy to say! I sowed the good seed, in spite of him, by\r\nthrowing a second tract in at the window of the cab.\r\n\r\nThe servant who answered the door\xe2\x80\x94not the person with the cap-ribbons,\r\nto my great relief, but the foot-man\xe2\x80\x94informed me that the doctor had\r\ncalled, and was still shut up with Lady Verinder. Mr. Bruff, the\r\nlawyer, had arrived a minute since and was waiting in the library. I\r\nwas shown into the library to wait too.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff looked surprised to see me. He is the family solicitor, and\r\nwe had met more than once, on previous occasions, under Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroof. A man, I grieve to say, grown old and grizzled in the service of\r\nthe world. A man who, in his hours of business, was the chosen prophet\r\nof Law and Mammon; and who, in his hours of leisure, was equally\r\ncapable of reading a novel and of tearing up a tract.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you come to stay here, Miss Clack?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with a look at my\r\ncarpet-bag.\r\n\r\nTo reveal the contents of my precious bag to such a person as this\r\nwould have been simply to invite an outburst of profanity. I lowered\r\nmyself to his own level, and mentioned my business in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt has informed me that she is about to sign her Will,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has been so good as to ask me to be one of the\r\nwitnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye? aye? Well, Miss Clack, you will do. You are over twenty-one, and\r\nyou have not the slightest pecuniary interest in Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s Will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot the slightest pecuniary interest in Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s Will. Oh, how\r\nthankful I felt when I heard that! If my aunt, possessed of thousands,\r\nhad remembered poor Me, to whom five pounds is an object\xe2\x80\x94if my name had\r\nappeared in the Will, with a little comforting legacy attached to it\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nenemies might have doubted the motive which had loaded me with the\r\nchoicest treasures of my library, and had drawn upon my failing\r\nresources for the prodigal expenses of a cab. Not the cruellest scoffer\r\nof them all could doubt now. Much better as it was! Oh, surely, surely,\r\nmuch better as it was!\r\n\r\nI was aroused from these consoling reflections by the voice of Mr.\r\nBruff. My meditative silence appeared to weigh upon the spirits of this\r\nworldling, and to force him, as it were, into talking to me against his\r\nown will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Clack, what\xe2\x80\x99s the last news in the charitable circles? How\r\nis your friend Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite, after the mauling he got from the\r\nrogues in Northumberland Street? Egad! they\xe2\x80\x99re telling a pretty story\r\nabout that charitable gentleman at my club!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had passed over the manner in which this person had remarked that I\r\nwas more than twenty-one, and that I had no pecuniary interest in my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s Will. But the tone in which he alluded to dear Mr. Godfrey was\r\ntoo much for my forbearance. Feeling bound, after what had passed in my\r\npresence that afternoon, to assert the innocence of my admirable\r\nfriend, whenever I found it called in question\xe2\x80\x94I own to having also\r\nfelt bound to include in the accomplishment of this righteous purpose,\r\na stinging castigation in the case of Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live very much out of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess the\r\nadvantage, sir, of belonging to a club. But I happen to know the story\r\nto which you allude; and I also know that a viler falsehood than that\r\nstory never was told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x94you believe in your friend. Natural enough. Mr.\r\nGodfrey Ablewhite, won\xe2\x80\x99t find the world in general quite so easy to\r\nconvince as a committee of charitable ladies. Appearances are dead\r\nagainst him. He was in the house when the Diamond was lost. And he was\r\nthe first person in the house to go to London afterwards. Those are\r\nugly circumstances, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, viewed by the light of later events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ought, I know, to have set him right before he went any farther. I\r\nought to have told him that he was speaking in ignorance of a testimony\r\nto Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, offered by the only person who was\r\nundeniably competent to speak from a positive knowledge of the subject.\r\nAlas! the temptation to lead the lawyer artfully on to his own\r\ndiscomfiture was too much for me. I asked what he meant by \xe2\x80\x9clater\r\nevents\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with an appearance of the utmost innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy later events, Miss Clack, I mean events in which the Indians are\r\nconcerned,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Mr. Bruff, getting more and more superior to poor\r\nMe, the longer he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do the Indians do, the moment they are\r\nlet out of the prison at Frizinghall? They go straight to London, and\r\nfix on Mr. Luker. What follows? Mr. Luker feels alarmed for the safety\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98a valuable of great price,\xe2\x80\x99 which he has got in the house. He\r\nlodges it privately (under a general description) in his bankers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstrongroom. Wonderfully clever of him: but the Indians are just as\r\nclever on their side. They have their suspicions that the \xe2\x80\x98valuable of\r\ngreat price\xe2\x80\x99 is being shifted from one place to another; and they hit\r\non a singularly bold and complete way of clearing those suspicions up.\r\nWhom do they seize and search? Not Mr. Luker only\xe2\x80\x94which would be\r\nintelligible enough\xe2\x80\x94but Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite as well. Why? Mr.\r\nAblewhite\xe2\x80\x99s explanation is, that they acted on blind suspicion, after\r\nseeing him accidentally speaking to Mr. Luker. Absurd! Half-a-dozen\r\nother people spoke to Mr. Luker that morning. Why were they not\r\nfollowed home too, and decoyed into the trap? No! no! The plain\r\ninference is, that Mr. Ablewhite had his private interest in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98valuable\xe2\x80\x99 as well as Mr. Luker, and that the Indians were so uncertain\r\nas to which of the two had the disposal of it, that there was no\r\nalternative but to search them both. Public opinion says that, Miss\r\nClack. And public opinion, on this occasion, is not easily refuted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said those last words, looking so wonderfully wise in his own\r\nworldly conceit, that I really (to my shame be it spoken) could not\r\nresist leading him a little farther still, before I overwhelmed him\r\nwith the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t presume to argue with a clever lawyer like you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nis it quite fair, sir, to Mr. Ablewhite to pass over the opinion of the\r\nfamous London police officer who investigated this case? Not the shadow\r\nof a suspicion rested upon anybody but Miss Verinder, in the mind of\r\nSergeant Cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to tell me, Miss Clack, that you agree with the Sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI judge nobody, sir, and I offer no opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I commit both those enormities, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I judge the Sergeant to\r\nhave been utterly wrong; and I offer the opinion that, if he had known\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s character as I know it, he would have suspected everybody in\r\nthe house but _her_. I admit that she has her faults\xe2\x80\x94she is secret, and\r\nself-willed; odd and wild, and unlike other girls of her age. But true\r\nas steel, and high-minded and generous to a fault. If the plainest\r\nevidence in the world pointed one way, and if nothing but Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s word\r\nof honour pointed the other, I would take her word before the evidence,\r\nlawyer as I am! Strong language, Miss Clack; but I mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you object to illustrate your meaning, Mr. Bruff, so that I may\r\nbe sure I understand it? Suppose you found Miss Verinder quite\r\nunaccountably interested in what has happened to Mr. Ablewhite and Mr.\r\nLuker? Suppose she asked the strangest questions about this dreadful\r\nscandal, and displayed the most ungovernable agitation when she found\r\nout the turn it was taking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose anything you please, Miss Clack, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shake my belief\r\nin Rachel Verinder by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is so absolutely to be relied on as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo absolutely to be relied on as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen permit me to inform you, Mr. Bruff, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\r\nwas in this house not two hours since, and that his entire innocence of\r\nall concern in the disappearance of the Moonstone was proclaimed by\r\nMiss Verinder herself, in the strongest language I ever heard used by a\r\nyoung lady in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the triumph\xe2\x80\x94the unholy triumph, I fear I must admit\xe2\x80\x94of seeing\r\nMr. Bruff utterly confounded and overthrown by a few plain words from\r\nMe. He started to his feet, and stared at me in silence. I kept my\r\nseat, undisturbed, and related the whole scene as it had occurred. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwhat do you say about Mr. Ablewhite _now?_\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, with the utmost\r\npossible gentleness, as soon as I had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Rachel has testified to his innocence, Miss Clack, I don\xe2\x80\x99t scruple\r\nto say that I believe in his innocence as firmly as you do. I have been\r\nmisled by appearances, like the rest of the world; and I will make the\r\nbest atonement I can, by publicly contradicting the scandal which has\r\nassailed your friend wherever I meet with it. In the meantime, allow me\r\nto congratulate you on the masterly manner in which you have opened the\r\nfull fire of your batteries on me at the moment when I least expected\r\nit. You would have done great things in my profession, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, if you\r\nhad happened to be a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he turned away from me, and began walking irritably up\r\nand down the room.\r\n\r\nI could see plainly that the new light I had thrown on the subject had\r\ngreatly surprised and disturbed him. Certain expressions dropped from\r\nhis lips, as he became more and more absorbed in his own thoughts,\r\nwhich suggested to my mind the abominable view that he had hitherto\r\ntaken of the mystery of the lost Moonstone. He had not scrupled to\r\nsuspect dear Mr. Godfrey of the infamy of stealing the Diamond, and to\r\nattribute Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to a generous resolution to conceal the\r\ncrime. On Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s own authority\xe2\x80\x94a perfectly unassailable\r\nauthority, as you are aware, in the estimation of Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nexplanation of the circumstances was now shown to be utterly wrong. The\r\nperplexity into which I had plunged this high legal authority was so\r\noverwhelming that he was quite unable to conceal it from notice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\na case!\xe2\x80\x9d I heard him say to himself, stopping at the window in his\r\nwalk, and drumming on the glass with his fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt not only defies\r\nexplanation, it\xe2\x80\x99s even beyond conjecture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in these words which made any reply at all needful,\r\non my part\xe2\x80\x94and yet, I answered them! It seems hardly credible that I\r\nshould not have been able to let Mr. Bruff alone, even now. It seems\r\nalmost beyond mere mortal perversity that I should have discovered, in\r\nwhat he had just said, a new opportunity of making myself personally\r\ndisagreeable to him. But\xe2\x80\x94ah, my friends! nothing is beyond mortal\r\nperversity; and anything is credible when our fallen natures get the\r\nbetter of us!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for intruding on your reflections,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to the\r\nunsuspecting Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cBut surely there is a conjecture to make which\r\nhas not occurred to us yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, Miss Clack. I own I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I was so fortunate, sir, as to convince you of Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninnocence, you mentioned it as one of the reasons for suspecting him,\r\nthat he was in the house at the time when the Diamond was lost. Permit\r\nme to remind you that Mr. Franklin Blake was also in the house at the\r\ntime when the Diamond was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old worldling left the window, took a chair exactly opposite to\r\nmine, and looked at me steadily, with a hard and vicious smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not so good a lawyer, Miss Clack,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked in a meditative\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cas I supposed. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to let well alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I fail to follow you, Mr. Bruff,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, modestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do, Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x94it really won\xe2\x80\x99t do a second time. Franklin\r\nBlake is a prime favourite of mine, as you are well aware. But that\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll adopt your view, on this occasion, before you have\r\ntime to turn round on me. You\xe2\x80\x99re quite right, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I have suspected\r\nMr. Ablewhite, on grounds which abstractedly justify suspecting Mr.\r\nBlake too. Very good\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s suspect them together. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite in his\r\ncharacter, we will say, to be capable of stealing the Moonstone. The\r\nonly question is, whether it was his interest to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s debts,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9care matters of family\r\nnotoriety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s debts have not arrived at that stage of\r\ndevelopment yet. Quite true. But there happen to be two difficulties in\r\nthe way of your theory, Miss Clack. I manage Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s affairs,\r\nand I beg to inform you that the vast majority of his creditors\r\n(knowing his father to be a rich man) are quite content to charge\r\ninterest on their debts, and to wait for their money. There is the\r\nfirst difficulty\xe2\x80\x94which is tough enough. You will find the second\r\ntougher still. I have it on the authority of Lady Verinder herself,\r\nthat her daughter was ready to marry Franklin Blake, before that\r\ninfernal Indian Diamond disappeared from the house. She had drawn him\r\non and put him off again, with the coquetry of a young girl. But she\r\nhad confessed to her mother that she loved cousin Franklin, and her\r\nmother had trusted cousin Franklin with the secret. So there he was,\r\nMiss Clack, with his creditors content to wait, and with the certain\r\nprospect before him of marrying an heiress. By all means consider him a\r\nscoundrel; but tell me, if you please, why he should steal the\r\nMoonstone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe human heart is unsearchable,\xe2\x80\x9d I said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is to fathom\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94though he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the shadow of a reason for\r\ntaking the Diamond\xe2\x80\x94he might have taken it, nevertheless, through\r\nnatural depravity. Very well. Say he did. Why the devil\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Bruff. If I hear the devil referred to in that\r\nmanner, I must leave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg _your_ pardon, Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll be more careful in my choice of\r\nlanguage for the future. All I meant to ask was this. Why\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nsupposing he did take the Diamond\xe2\x80\x94should Franklin Blake make himself\r\nthe most prominent person in the house in trying to recover it? You may\r\ntell me he cunningly did that to divert suspicion from himself. I\r\nanswer that he had no need to divert suspicion\xe2\x80\x94because nobody suspected\r\nhim. He first steals the Moonstone (without the slightest reason)\r\nthrough natural depravity; and he then acts a part, in relation to the\r\nloss of the jewel, which there is not the slightest necessity to act,\r\nand which leads to his mortally offending the young lady who would\r\notherwise have married him. That is the monstrous proposition which you\r\nare driven to assert, if you attempt to associate the disappearance of\r\nthe Moonstone with Franklin Blake. No, no, Miss Clack! After what has\r\npassed here today, between us two, the dead-lock, in this case, is\r\ncomplete. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s own innocence is (as her mother knows, and as I\r\nknow) beyond a doubt. Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s innocence is equally certain\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nRachel would never have testified to it. And Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninnocence, as you have just seen, unanswerably asserts itself. On the\r\none hand, we are morally certain of all these things. And, on the other\r\nhand, we are equally sure that somebody has brought the Moonstone to\r\nLondon, and that Mr. Luker, or his banker, is in private possession of\r\nit at this moment. What is the use of my experience, what is the use of\r\nany person\xe2\x80\x99s experience, in such a case as that? It baffles me; it\r\nbaffles you, it baffles everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94not everybody. It had not baffled Sergeant Cuff. I was about to\r\nmention this, with all possible mildness, and with every necessary\r\nprotest against being supposed to cast a slur upon Rachel\xe2\x80\x94when the\r\nservant came in to say that the doctor had gone, and that my aunt was\r\nwaiting to receive us.\r\n\r\nThis stopped the discussion. Mr. Bruff collected his papers, looking a\r\nlittle exhausted by the demands which our conversation had made on him.\r\nI took up my bag-full of precious publications, feeling as if I could\r\nhave gone on talking for hours. We proceeded in silence to Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nPermit me to add here, before my narrative advances to other events,\r\nthat I have not described what passed between the lawyer and me,\r\nwithout having a definite object in view. I am ordered to include in my\r\ncontribution to the shocking story of the Moonstone a plain disclosure,\r\nnot only of the turn which suspicion took, but even of the names of the\r\npersons on whom suspicion rested, at the time when the Indian Diamond\r\nwas believed to be in London. A report of my conversation in the\r\nlibrary with Mr. Bruff appeared to me to be exactly what was wanted to\r\nanswer this purpose\xe2\x80\x94while, at the same time, it possessed the great\r\nmoral advantage of rendering a sacrifice of sinful self-esteem\r\nessentially necessary on my part. I have been obliged to acknowledge\r\nthat my fallen nature got the better of me. In making that humiliating\r\nconfession, _I_ get the better of my fallen nature. The moral balance\r\nis restored; the spiritual atmosphere feels clear once more. Dear\r\nfriends, we may go on again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe signing of the Will was a much shorter matter than I had\r\nanticipated. It was hurried over, to my thinking, in indecent haste.\r\nSamuel, the footman, was sent for to act as second witness\xe2\x80\x94and the pen\r\nwas put at once into my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s hand. I felt strongly urged to say a few\r\nappropriate words on this solemn occasion. But Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nconvinced me that it was wisest to check the impulse while he was in\r\nthe room. In less than two minutes it was all over\xe2\x80\x94and Samuel\r\n(unbenefited by what I might have said) had gone downstairs again.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff folded up the Will, and then looked my way; apparently\r\nwondering whether I did or did not mean to leave him alone with my\r\naunt. I had my mission of mercy to fulfil, and my bag of precious\r\npublications ready on my lap. He might as well have expected to move\r\nSt. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral by looking at it, as to move Me. There was one\r\nmerit about him (due no doubt to his worldly training) which I have no\r\nwish to deny. He was quick at seeing things. I appeared to produce\r\nalmost the same impression on him which I had produced on the cabman.\r\n_He_ too uttered a profane expression, and withdrew in a violent hurry,\r\nand left me mistress of the field.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were alone, my aunt reclined on the sofa, and then\r\nalluded, with some appearance of confusion, to the subject of her Will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think yourself neglected, Drusilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmean to _give_ you your little legacy, my dear, with my own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was a golden opportunity! I seized it on the spot. In other words,\r\nI instantly opened my bag, and took out the top publication. It proved\r\nto be an early edition\xe2\x80\x94only the twenty-fifth\xe2\x80\x94of the famous anonymous\r\nwork (believed to be by precious Miss Bellows), entitled _The Serpent\r\nat Home_. The design of the book\xe2\x80\x94with which the worldly reader may not\r\nbe acquainted\xe2\x80\x94is to show how the Evil One lies in wait for us in all\r\nthe most apparently innocent actions of our daily lives. The chapters\r\nbest adapted to female perusal are \xe2\x80\x9cSatan in the Hair Brush;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSatan\r\nbehind the Looking Glass;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSatan under the Tea Table;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSatan out of\r\nthe Window\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and many others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive your attention, dear aunt, to this precious book\xe2\x80\x94and you will\r\ngive me all I ask.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words, I handed it to her open, at a\r\nmarked passage\xe2\x80\x94one continuous burst of burning eloquence! Subject:\r\nSatan among the Sofa Cushions.\r\n\r\nPoor Lady Verinder (reclining thoughtlessly on her own sofa cushions)\r\nglanced at the book, and handed it back to me looking more confused\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, Drusilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must wait till I am a little\r\nbetter, before I can read that. The doctor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment she mentioned the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s name, I knew what was coming.\r\nOver and over again in my past experience among my perishing\r\nfellow-creatures, the members of the notoriously infidel profession of\r\nMedicine had stepped between me and my mission of mercy\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nmiserable pretence that the patient wanted quiet, and that the\r\ndisturbing influence of all others which they most dreaded, was the\r\ninfluence of Miss Clack and her Books. Precisely the same blinded\r\nmaterialism (working treacherously behind my back) now sought to rob me\r\nof the only right of property that my poverty could claim\xe2\x80\x94my right of\r\nspiritual property in my perishing aunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d my poor misguided relative went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am\r\nnot so well today. He forbids me to see any strangers; and he orders\r\nme, if I read at all, only to read the lightest and the most amusing\r\nbooks. \xe2\x80\x98Do nothing, Lady Verinder, to weary your head, or to quicken\r\nyour pulse\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94those were his last words, Drusilla, when he left me\r\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it but to yield again\xe2\x80\x94for the moment only, as\r\nbefore. Any open assertion of the infinitely superior importance of\r\nsuch a ministry as mine, compared with the ministry of the medical man,\r\nwould only have provoked the doctor to practise on the human weakness\r\nof his patient, and to threaten to throw up the case. Happily, there\r\nare more ways than one of sowing the good seed, and few persons are\r\nbetter versed in those ways than myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might feel stronger, dear, in an hour or two,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr you\r\nmight wake, tomorrow morning, with a sense of something wanting, and\r\neven this unpretending volume might be able to supply it. You will let\r\nme leave the book, aunt? The doctor can hardly object to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI slipped it under the sofa cushions, half in, and half out, close by\r\nher handkerchief, and her smelling-bottle. Every time her hand searched\r\nfor either of these, it would touch the book; and, sooner or later (who\r\nknows?) the book might touch _her_. After making this arrangement, I\r\nthought it wise to withdraw. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me leave you to repose, dear aunt; I\r\nwill call again tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d I looked accidentally towards the window as\r\nI said that. It was full of flowers, in boxes and pots. Lady Verinder\r\nwas extravagantly fond of these perishable treasures, and had a habit\r\nof rising every now and then, and going to look at them and smell them.\r\nA new idea flashed across my mind. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! may I take a flower?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94and got to the window unsuspected, in that way. Instead of taking\r\naway a flower, I added one, in the shape of another book from my bag,\r\nwhich I left, to surprise my aunt, among the geraniums and roses. The\r\nhappy thought followed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not do the same for her, poor dear, in\r\nevery other room that she enters?\xe2\x80\x9d I immediately said good-bye; and,\r\ncrossing the hall, slipped into the library. Samuel, coming up to let\r\nme out, and supposing I had gone, went downstairs again. On the library\r\ntable I noticed two of the \xe2\x80\x9camusing books\xe2\x80\x9d which the infidel doctor had\r\nrecommended. I instantly covered them from sight with two of my own\r\nprecious publications. In the breakfast-room I found my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite canary singing in his cage. She was always in the habit of\r\nfeeding the bird herself. Some groundsel was strewed on a table which\r\nstood immediately under the cage. I put a book among the groundsel. In\r\nthe drawing-room I found more cheering opportunities of emptying my\r\nbag. My aunt\xe2\x80\x99s favourite musical pieces were on the piano. I slipped in\r\ntwo more books among the music. I disposed of another in the back\r\ndrawing-room, under some unfinished embroidery, which I knew to be of\r\nLady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s working. A third little room opened out of the back\r\ndrawing-room, from which it was shut off by curtains instead of a door.\r\nMy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s plain old-fashioned fan was on the chimney-piece. I opened my\r\nninth book at a very special passage, and put the fan in as a marker,\r\nto keep the place. The question then came, whether I should go higher\r\nstill, and try the bedroom floor\xe2\x80\x94at the risk, undoubtedly, of being\r\ninsulted, if the person with the cap-ribbons happened to be in the\r\nupper regions of the house, and to find me out. But oh, what of that?\r\nIt is a poor Christian that is afraid of being insulted. I went\r\nupstairs, prepared to bear anything. All was silent and solitary\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nthe servants\xe2\x80\x99 tea-time, I suppose. My aunt\xe2\x80\x99s room was in front. The\r\nminiature of my late dear uncle, Sir John, hung on the wall opposite\r\nthe bed. It seemed to smile at me; it seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDrusilla! deposit\r\na book.\xe2\x80\x9d There were tables on either side of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s bed. She was a\r\nbad sleeper, and wanted, or thought she wanted, many things at night. I\r\nput a book near the matches on one side, and a book under the box of\r\nchocolate drops on the other. Whether she wanted a light, or whether\r\nshe wanted a drop, there was a precious publication to meet her eye, or\r\nto meet her hand, and to say with silent eloquence, in either case,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, try me! try me!\xe2\x80\x9d But one book was now left at the bottom of my\r\nbag, and but one apartment was still unexplored\xe2\x80\x94the bath-room, which\r\nopened out of the bedroom. I peeped in; and the holy inner voice that\r\nnever deceives, whispered to me, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have met her, Drusilla,\r\neverywhere else; meet her at the bath, and the work is done.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nobserved a dressing-gown thrown across a chair. It had a pocket in it,\r\nand in that pocket I put my last book. Can words express my exquisite\r\nsense of duty done, when I had slipped out of the house, unsuspected by\r\nany of them, and when I found myself in the street with my empty bag\r\nunder my arm? Oh, my worldly friends, pursuing the phantom, Pleasure,\r\nthrough the guilty mazes of Dissipation, how easy it is to be happy, if\r\nyou will only be good!\r\n\r\nWhen I folded up my things that night\xe2\x80\x94when I reflected on the _true_\r\nriches which I had scattered with such a lavish hand, from top to\r\nbottom of the house of my wealthy aunt\xe2\x80\x94I declare I felt as free from\r\nall anxiety as if I had been a child again. I was so light-hearted that\r\nI sang a verse of the Evening Hymn. I was so light-hearted that I fell\r\nasleep before I could sing another. Quite like a child again! quite\r\nlike a child again!\r\n\r\nSo I passed that blissful night. On rising the next morning, how young\r\nI felt! I might add, how young I looked, if I were capable of dwelling\r\non the concerns of my own perishable body. But I am not capable\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nadd nothing.\r\n\r\nTowards luncheon time\xe2\x80\x94not for the sake of the creature-comforts, but\r\nfor the certainty of finding dear aunt\xe2\x80\x94I put on my bonnet to go to\r\nMontagu Square. Just as I was ready, the maid at the lodgings in which\r\nI then lived looked in at the door, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s servant,\r\nto see Miss Clack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI occupied the parlour-floor, at that period of my residence in London.\r\nThe front parlour was my sitting-room. Very small, very low in the\r\nceiling, very poorly furnished\xe2\x80\x94but, oh, so neat! I looked into the\r\npassage to see which of Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s servants had asked for me. It\r\nwas the young footman, Samuel\xe2\x80\x94a civil fresh-coloured person, with a\r\nteachable look and a very obliging manner. I had always felt a\r\nspiritual interest in Samuel, and a wish to try him with a few serious\r\nwords. On this occasion, I invited him into my sitting-room.\r\n\r\nHe came in, with a large parcel under his arm. When he put the parcel\r\ndown, it appeared to frighten him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s love, Miss; and I was to\r\nsay that you would find a letter inside.\xe2\x80\x9d Having given that message,\r\nthe fresh-coloured young footman surprised me by looking as if he would\r\nhave liked to run away.\r\n\r\nI detained him to make a few kind inquiries. Could I see my aunt, if I\r\ncalled in Montagu Square? No; she had gone out for a drive. Miss Rachel\r\nhad gone with her, and Mr. Ablewhite had taken a seat in the carriage,\r\ntoo. Knowing how sadly dear Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s charitable work was in\r\narrear, I thought it odd that he should be going out driving, like an\r\nidle man. I stopped Samuel at the door, and made a few more kind\r\ninquiries. Miss Rachel was going to a ball that night, and Mr.\r\nAblewhite had arranged to come to coffee, and go with her. There was a\r\nmorning concert advertised for tomorrow, and Samuel was ordered to take\r\nplaces for a large party, including a place for Mr. Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\r\ntickets may be gone, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said this innocent youth, \xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t run\r\nand get them at once!\xe2\x80\x9d He ran as he said the words\xe2\x80\x94and I found myself\r\nalone again, with some anxious thoughts to occupy me.\r\n\r\nWe had a special meeting of the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes-Conversion\r\nSociety that night, summoned expressly with a view to obtaining Mr.\r\nGodfrey\xe2\x80\x99s advice and assistance. Instead of sustaining our sisterhood,\r\nunder an overwhelming flow of Trousers which quite prostrated our\r\nlittle community, he had arranged to take coffee in Montagu Square, and\r\nto go to a ball afterwards! The afternoon of the next day had been\r\nselected for the Festival of the\r\nBritish-Ladies\xe2\x80\x99-Servants\xe2\x80\x99-Sunday-Sweetheart-Supervision Society.\r\nInstead of being present, the life and soul of that struggling\r\nInstitution, he had engaged to make one of a party of worldlings at a\r\nmorning concert! I asked myself what did it mean? Alas! it meant that\r\nour Christian Hero was to reveal himself to me in a new character, and\r\nto become associated in my mind with one of the most awful backslidings\r\nof modern times.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the history of the passing day. On finding\r\nmyself alone in my room, I naturally turned my attention to the parcel\r\nwhich appeared to have so strangely intimidated the fresh-coloured\r\nyoung footman. Had my aunt sent me my promised legacy? and had it taken\r\nthe form of cast-off clothes, or worn-out silver spoons, or\r\nunfashionable jewellery, or anything of that sort? Prepared to accept\r\nall, and to resent nothing, I opened the parcel\xe2\x80\x94and what met my view?\r\nThe twelve precious publications which I had scattered through the\r\nhouse, on the previous day; all returned to me by the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders!\r\nWell might the youthful Samuel shrink when he brought his parcel into\r\nmy room! Well might he run when he had performed his miserable errand!\r\nAs to my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s letter, it simply amounted, poor soul, to this\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\ndare not disobey her medical man.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done now? With my training and my principles, I never\r\nhad a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt.\r\n\r\nOnce self-supported by conscience, once embarked on a career of\r\nmanifest usefulness, the true Christian never yields. Neither public\r\nnor private influences produce the slightest effect on us, when we have\r\nonce got our mission. Taxation may be the consequence of a mission;\r\nriots may be the consequence of a mission; wars may be the consequence\r\nof a mission: we go on with our work, irrespective of every human\r\nconsideration which moves the world outside us. We are above reason; we\r\nare beyond ridicule; we see with nobody\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, we hear with nobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears, we feel with nobody\xe2\x80\x99s hearts, but our own. Glorious, glorious\r\nprivilege! And how is it earned? Ah, my friends, you may spare\r\nyourselves the useless inquiry! We are the only people who can earn\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94for we are the only people who are always right.\r\n\r\nIn the case of my misguided aunt, the form which pious perseverance was\r\nnext to take revealed itself to me plainly enough.\r\n\r\nPreparation by clerical friends had failed, owing to Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown reluctance. Preparation by books had failed, owing to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfidel obstinacy. So be it! What was the next thing to try? The next\r\nthing to try was\xe2\x80\x94Preparation by Little Notes. In other words, the books\r\nthemselves having been sent back, select extracts from the books,\r\ncopied by different hands, and all addressed as letters to my aunt,\r\nwere, some to be sent by post, and some to be distributed about the\r\nhouse on the plan I had adopted on the previous day. As letters they\r\nwould excite no suspicion; as letters they would be opened\xe2\x80\x94and, once\r\nopened, might be read. Some of them I wrote myself. \xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt, may I\r\nask your attention to a few lines?\xe2\x80\x9d &c. \xe2\x80\x9cDear aunt, I was reading last\r\nnight, and I chanced on the following passage,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. Other letters were\r\nwritten for me by my valued fellow-workers, the sisterhood at the\r\nMothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cDear madam, pardon the interest taken in you\r\nby a true, though humble, friend.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDear madam, may a serious person\r\nsurprise you by saying a few cheering words?\xe2\x80\x9d Using these and other\r\nsimilar forms of courteous appeal, we reintroduced all my precious\r\npassages under a form which not even the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s watchful materialism\r\ncould suspect. Before the shades of evening had closed around us, I had\r\na dozen awakening letters for my aunt, instead of a dozen awakening\r\nbooks. Six I made immediate arrangements for sending through the post,\r\nand six I kept in my pocket for personal distribution in the house the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nSoon after two o\xe2\x80\x99clock I was again on the field of pious conflict,\r\naddressing more kind inquiries to Samuel at Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nMy aunt had had a bad night. She was again in the room in which I had\r\nwitnessed her Will, resting on the sofa, and trying to get a little\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nI said I would wait in the library, on the chance of seeing her. In the\r\nfervour of my zeal to distribute the letters, it never occurred to me\r\nto inquire about Rachel. The house was quiet, and it was past the hour\r\nat which the musical performance began. I took it for granted that she\r\nand her party of pleasure-seekers (Mr. Godfrey, alas! included) were\r\nall at the concert, and eagerly devoted myself to my good work, while\r\ntime and opportunity were still at my own disposal.\r\n\r\nMy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence of the morning\xe2\x80\x94including the six awakening\r\nletters which I had posted overnight\xe2\x80\x94was lying unopened on the library\r\ntable. She had evidently not felt herself equal to dealing with a large\r\nmass of letters\xe2\x80\x94and she might be daunted by the number of them, if she\r\nentered the library later in the day. I put one of my second set of six\r\nletters on the chimney-piece by itself; leaving it to attract her\r\ncuriosity, by means of its solitary position, apart from the rest. A\r\nsecond letter I put purposely on the floor in the breakfast-room. The\r\nfirst servant who went in after me would conclude that my aunt had\r\ndropped it, and would be specially careful to restore it to her. The\r\nfield thus sown on the basement story, I ran lightly upstairs to\r\nscatter my mercies next over the drawing-room floor.\r\n\r\nJust as I entered the front room, I heard a double knock at the\r\nstreet-door\xe2\x80\x94a soft, fluttering, considerate little knock. Before I\r\ncould think of slipping back to the library (in which I was supposed to\r\nbe waiting), the active young footman was in the hall, answering the\r\ndoor. It mattered little, as I thought. In my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s state of health,\r\nvisitors in general were not admitted. To my horror and amazement, the\r\nperformer of the soft little knock proved to be an exception to general\r\nrules. Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s voice below me (after apparently answering some\r\nquestions which I did not hear) said, unmistakably, \xe2\x80\x9cUpstairs, if you\r\nplease, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d The next moment I heard footsteps\xe2\x80\x94a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps\xe2\x80\x94approaching the drawing-room floor. Who could this favoured\r\nmale visitor possibly be? Almost as soon as I asked myself the\r\nquestion, the answer occurred to me. Who _could_ it be but the doctor?\r\n\r\nIn the case of any other visitor, I should have allowed myself to be\r\ndiscovered in the drawing-room. There would have been nothing out of\r\nthe common in my having got tired of the library, and having gone\r\nupstairs for a change. But my own self-respect stood in the way of my\r\nmeeting the person who had insulted me by sending me back my books. I\r\nslipped into the little third room, which I have mentioned as\r\ncommunicating with the back drawing-room, and dropped the curtains\r\nwhich closed the open doorway. If I only waited there for a minute or\r\ntwo, the usual result in such cases would take place. That is to say,\r\nthe doctor would be conducted to his patient\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nI waited a minute or two, and more than a minute or two. I heard the\r\nvisitor walking restlessly backwards and forwards. I also heard him\r\ntalking to himself. I even thought I recognised the voice. Had I made a\r\nmistake? Was it not the doctor, but somebody else? Mr. Bruff, for\r\ninstance? No! an unerring instinct told me it was not Mr. Bruff.\r\nWhoever he was, he was still talking to himself. I parted the heavy\r\ncurtains the least little morsel in the world, and listened.\r\n\r\nThe words I heard were, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it today!\xe2\x80\x9d And the voice that spoke\r\nthem was Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMy hand dropped from the curtain. But don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\xe2\x80\x94oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuppose\xe2\x80\x94that the dreadful embarrassment of my situation was the\r\nuppermost idea in my mind! So fervent still was the sisterly interest I\r\nfelt in Mr. Godfrey, that I never stopped to ask myself why he was not\r\nat the concert. No! I thought only of the words\xe2\x80\x94the startling\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94which had just fallen from his lips. He would do it today. He had\r\nsaid, in a tone of terrible resolution, he would do it today. What, oh\r\nwhat, would he do? Something even more deplorably unworthy of him than\r\nwhat he had done already? Would he apostatise from the faith? Would he\r\nabandon us at the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes? Had we seen the last of his\r\nangelic smile in the committee-room? Had we heard the last of his\r\nunrivalled eloquence at Exeter Hall? I was so wrought up by the bare\r\nidea of such awful eventualities as these in connection with such a\r\nman, that I believe I should have rushed from my place of concealment,\r\nand implored him in the name of all the Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Committees in London to\r\nexplain himself\xe2\x80\x94when I suddenly heard another voice in the room. It\r\npenetrated through the curtains; it was loud, it was bold, it was\r\nwanting in every female charm. The voice of Rachel Verinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you come up here, Godfrey?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you go\r\ninto the library?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack is in the library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClack in the library!\xe2\x80\x9d She instantly seated herself on the ottoman in\r\nthe back drawing-room. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, Godfrey. We had much\r\nbetter stop here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been in a burning fever, a moment since, and in some doubt what\r\nto do next. I became extremely cold now, and felt no doubt whatever. To\r\nshow myself, after what I had heard, was impossible. To retreat\xe2\x80\x94except\r\ninto the fireplace\xe2\x80\x94was equally out of the question. A martyrdom was\r\nbefore me. In justice to myself, I noiselessly arranged the curtains so\r\nthat I could both see and hear. And then I met my martyrdom, with the\r\nspirit of a primitive Christian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t sit on the ottoman,\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cBring a chair,\r\nGodfrey. I like people to be opposite to me when I talk to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the nearest seat. It was a low chair. He was very tall, and\r\nmany sizes too large for it. I never saw his legs to such disadvantage\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say to them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what you said, dear Rachel, to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat mamma was not at all well today? And that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite like\r\nleaving her to go to the concert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose were the words. They were grieved to lose you at the concert,\r\nbut they quite understood. All sent their love; and all expressed a\r\ncheering belief that Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition would soon pass\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s serious, do you, Godfrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it! In a few days, I feel quite sure, all will be well\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, too. I was a little frightened at first, but I think so\r\ntoo. It was very kind to go and make my excuses for me to people who\r\nare almost strangers to you. But why not have gone with them to the\r\nconcert? It seems very hard that you should miss the music too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Rachel! If you only knew how much happier I am\xe2\x80\x94here,\r\nwith you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands, and looked at her. In the position which he\r\noccupied, when he did that, he turned my way. Can words describe how I\r\nsickened when I noticed exactly the same pathetic expression on his\r\nface, which had charmed me when he was pleading for destitute millions\r\nof his fellow-creatures on the platform at Exeter Hall!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get over one\xe2\x80\x99s bad habits, Godfrey. But do try to get\r\nover the habit of paying compliments\xe2\x80\x94do, to please me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never paid _you_ a compliment, Rachel, in my life. Successful love\r\nmay sometimes use the language of flattery, I admit. But hopeless love,\r\ndearest, always speaks the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew his chair close, and took her hand, when he said \xe2\x80\x9chopeless\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a momentary silence. He, who thrilled everybody, had\r\ndoubtless thrilled _her_. I thought I now understood the words which\r\nhad dropped from him when he was alone in the drawing-room, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it\r\ntoday.\xe2\x80\x9d Alas! the most rigid propriety could hardly have failed to\r\ndiscover that he was doing it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you forgotten what we agreed on, Godfrey, when you spoke to me in\r\nthe country? We agreed that we were to be cousins, and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI break the agreement, Rachel, every time I see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite useless! I break the agreement every time I think of you. Oh,\r\nRachel! how kindly you told me, only the other day, that my place in\r\nyour estimation was a higher place than it had ever been yet! Am I mad\r\nto build the hopes I do on those dear words? Am I mad to dream of some\r\nfuture day when your heart may soften to me? Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me so, if I am!\r\nLeave me my delusion, dearest! I must have _that_ to cherish, and to\r\ncomfort me, if I have nothing else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled, and he put his white handkerchief to his eyes.\r\nExeter Hall again! Nothing wanting to complete the parallel but the\r\naudience, the cheers, and the glass of water.\r\n\r\nEven _her_ obdurate nature was touched. I saw her lean a little nearer\r\nto him. I heard a new tone of interest in her next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really sure, Godfrey, that you are so fond of me as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure! You know what I was, Rachel. Let me tell you what I am. I have\r\nlost every interest in life, but my interest in you. A transformation\r\nhas come over me which I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for, myself. Would you believe\r\nit? My charitable business is an unendurable nuisance to me; and when I\r\nsee a Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Committee now, I wish myself at the uttermost ends of the\r\nearth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the annals of apostasy offer anything comparable to such a\r\ndeclaration as that, I can only say that the case in point is not\r\nproducible from the stores of _my_ reading. I thought of the\r\nMothers\xe2\x80\x99-Small-Clothes. I thought of the Sunday-Sweetheart-Supervision.\r\nI thought of the other Societies, too numerous to mention, all built up\r\non this man as on a tower of strength. I thought of the struggling\r\nFemale Boards, who, so to speak, drew the breath of their business-life\r\nthrough the nostrils of Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x94of that same Mr. Godfrey who had\r\njust reviled our good work as a \xe2\x80\x9cnuisance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and just declared that he\r\nwished he was at the uttermost ends of the earth when he found himself\r\nin our company! My young female friends will feel encouraged to\r\npersevere, when I mention that it tried even my discipline before I\r\ncould devour my own righteous indignation in silence. At the same time,\r\nit is only justice to myself to add, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose a syllable of\r\nthe conversation. Rachel was the next to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made your confession,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether it would\r\ncure you of your unhappy attachment to me, if I made mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started. I confess I started too. He thought, and I thought, that\r\nshe was about to divulge the mystery of the Moonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you think, to look at me,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am the\r\nwretchedest girl living? It\xe2\x80\x99s true, Godfrey. What greater wretchedness\r\ncan there be than to live degraded in your own estimation? That is my\r\nlife now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Rachel! it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible you can have any reason to speak of\r\nyourself in that way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I have no reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you ask me the question! I know it, because I know _you_. Your\r\nsilence, dearest, has never lowered you in the estimation of your true\r\nfriends. The disappearance of your precious birthday gift may seem\r\nstrange; your unexplained connection with that event may seem stranger\r\nstill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you speaking of the Moonstone, Godfrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly thought that you referred\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI referred to nothing of the sort. I can hear of the loss of the\r\nMoonstone, let who will speak of it, without feeling degraded in my own\r\nestimation. If the story of the Diamond ever comes to light, it will be\r\nknown that I accepted a dreadful responsibility; it will be known that\r\nI involved myself in the keeping of a miserable secret\xe2\x80\x94but it will be\r\nas clear as the sun at noon-day that I did nothing mean! You have\r\nmisunderstood me, Godfrey. It\xe2\x80\x99s my fault for not speaking more plainly.\r\nCost me what it may, I will be plainer now. Suppose you were not in\r\nlove with me? Suppose you were in love with some other woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you discovered that woman to be utterly unworthy of you?\r\nSuppose you were quite convinced that it was a disgrace to you to waste\r\nanother thought on her? Suppose the bare idea of ever marrying such a\r\nperson made your face burn, only with thinking of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, suppose, in spite of all that\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tear her from your\r\nheart? Suppose the feeling she had roused in you (in the time when you\r\nbelieved in her) was not a feeling to be hidden? Suppose the love this\r\nwretch had inspired in you? Oh, how can I find words to say it in! How\r\ncan I make a _man_ understand that a feeling which horrifies me at\r\nmyself, can be a feeling that fascinates me at the same time? It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbreath of my life, Godfrey, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the poison that kills me\xe2\x80\x94both in\r\none! Go away! I must be out of my mind to talk as I am talking now. No!\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t carry away a wrong impression. I must\r\nsay what is to be said in my own defence. Mind this! _He_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94he never will know, what I have told _you_. I will never see him\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care what happens\xe2\x80\x94I will never, never, never see him again! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask me his name! Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me any more! Let\xe2\x80\x99s change the subject. Are\r\nyou doctor enough, Godfrey, to tell me why I feel as if I was stifling\r\nfor want of breath? Is there a form of hysterics that bursts into words\r\ninstead of tears? I dare say! What does it matter? You will get over\r\nany trouble I have caused you, easily enough now. I have dropped to my\r\nright place in your estimation, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I? Don\xe2\x80\x99t notice me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t pity\r\nme! For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round on a sudden, and beat her hands wildly on the back of\r\nthe ottoman. Her head dropped on the cushions; and she burst out\r\ncrying. Before I had time to feel shocked, at this, I was horror-struck\r\nby an entirely unexpected proceeding on the part of Mr. Godfrey. Will\r\nit be credited that he fell on his knees at her feet?\xe2\x80\x94on _both_ knees,\r\nI solemnly declare! May modesty mention that he put his arms round her\r\nnext? And may reluctant admiration acknowledge that he electrified her\r\nwith two words?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoble creature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo more than that! But he did it with one of the bursts which have made\r\nhis fame as a public speaker. She sat, either quite thunderstruck, or\r\nquite fascinated\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which\xe2\x80\x94without even making an effort to\r\nput his arms back where his arms ought to have been. As for me, my\r\nsense of propriety was completely bewildered. I was so painfully\r\nuncertain whether it was my first duty to close my eyes, or to stop my\r\nears, that I did neither. I attribute my being still able to hold the\r\ncurtain in the right position for looking and listening, entirely to\r\nsuppressed hysterics. In suppressed hysterics, it is admitted, even by\r\nthe doctors, that one must hold something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with all the fascination of his evangelical voice and\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a noble creature! A woman who can speak the truth, for\r\nthe truth\xe2\x80\x99s own sake\xe2\x80\x94a woman who will sacrifice her pride, rather than\r\nsacrifice an honest man who loves her\xe2\x80\x94is the most priceless of all\r\ntreasures. When such a woman marries, if her husband only wins her\r\nesteem and regard, he wins enough to ennoble his whole life. You have\r\nspoken, dearest, of your place in my estimation. Judge what that place\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94when I implore you on my knees, to let the cure of your poor wounded\r\nheart be my care. Rachel! will you honour me, will you bless me, by\r\nbeing my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time I should certainly have decided on stopping my ears, if\r\nRachel had not encouraged me to keep them open, by answering him in the\r\nfirst sensible words I had ever heard fall from her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodfrey!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never spoke more reasonably, dearest\xe2\x80\x94in your interests, as well as\r\nin mine. Look for a moment to the future. Is your happiness to be\r\nsacrificed to a man who has never known how you feel towards him, and\r\nwhom you are resolved never to see again? Is it not your duty to\r\nyourself to forget this ill-fated attachment? and is forgetfulness to\r\nbe found in the life you are leading now? You have tried that life, and\r\nyou are wearying of it already. Surround yourself with nobler interests\r\nthan the wretched interests of the world. A heart that loves and\r\nhonours you; a home whose peaceful claims and happy duties win gently\r\non you day by day\xe2\x80\x94try the consolation, Rachel, which is to be found\r\n_there!_ I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for your love\xe2\x80\x94I will be content with your\r\naffection and regard. Let the rest be left, confidently left, to your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s devotion, and to Time that heals even wounds as deep as\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to yield already. Oh, what a bringing-up she must have had!\r\nOh, how differently I should have acted in her place!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tempt me, Godfrey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI am wretched enough and reckless\r\nenough as it is. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tempt me to be more wretched and more wreckless\r\nstill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne question, Rachel. Have you any personal objection to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! I always liked you. After what you have just said to me, I should\r\nbe insensible indeed if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t respect and admire you as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know many wives, my dear Rachel, who respect and admire their\r\nhusbands? And yet they and their husbands get on very well. How many\r\nbrides go to the altar with hearts that would bear inspection by the\r\nmen who take them there? And yet it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end unhappily\xe2\x80\x94somehow or\r\nother the nuptial establishment jogs on. The truth is, that women try\r\nmarriage as a Refuge, far more numerously than they are willing to\r\nadmit; and, what is more, they find that marriage has justified their\r\nconfidence in it. Look at your own case once again. At your age, and\r\nwith your attractions, is it possible for you to sentence yourself to a\r\nsingle life? Trust my knowledge of the world\xe2\x80\x94nothing is less possible.\r\nIt is merely a question of time. You may marry some other man, some\r\nyears hence. Or you may marry the man, dearest, who is now at your\r\nfeet, and who prizes your respect and admiration above the love of any\r\nother woman on the face of the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, Godfrey! you are putting something into my head which I never\r\nthought of before. You are tempting me with a new prospect, when all my\r\nother prospects are closed before me. I tell you again, I am miserable\r\nenough and desperate enough, if you say another word, to marry you on\r\nyour own terms. Take the warning, and go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t even rise from my knees, till you have said yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I say yes you will repent, and I shall repent, when it is too\r\nlate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall both bless the day, darling, when I pressed, and when you\r\nyielded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel as confidently as you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall judge for yourself. I speak from what I have seen in my own\r\nfamily. Tell me what you think of our household at Frizinghall. Do my\r\nfather and mother live unhappily together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it\xe2\x80\x94so far as I can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my mother was a girl, Rachel (it is no secret in the family), she\r\nhad loved as you love\xe2\x80\x94she had given her heart to a man who was unworthy\r\nof her. She married my father, respecting him, admiring him, but\r\nnothing more. Your own eyes have seen the result. Is there no\r\nencouragement in it for you and for me?\xe2\x80\x9d*\r\n\r\n* See Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s Narrative, chapter viii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t hurry me, Godfrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy time shall be yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t ask me for more than I can give?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy angel! I only ask you to give me yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those two words, she accepted him!\r\n\r\nHe had another burst\xe2\x80\x94a burst of unholy rapture this time. He drew her\r\nnearer and nearer to him till her face touched his; and then\xe2\x80\x94No! I\r\nreally cannot prevail upon myself to carry this shocking disclosure any\r\nfarther. Let me only say, that I tried to close my eyes before it\r\nhappened, and that I was just one moment too late. I had calculated,\r\nyou see, on her resisting. She submitted. To every right-feeling person\r\nof my own sex, volumes could say no more.\r\n\r\nEven my innocence in such matters began to see its way to the end of\r\nthe interview now. They understood each other so thoroughly by this\r\ntime, that I fully expected to see them walk off together, arm in arm,\r\nto be married. There appeared, however, judging by Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s next\r\nwords, to be one more trifling formality which it was necessary to\r\nobserve. He seated himself\xe2\x80\x94unforbidden this time\xe2\x80\x94on the ottoman by her\r\nside. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I speak to your dear mother?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOr will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe declined both alternatives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet my mother hear nothing from either of us, until she is better. I\r\nwish it to be kept a secret for the present, Godfrey. Go now, and come\r\nback this evening. We have been here alone together quite long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and, in rising, looked for the first time towards the little\r\nroom in which my martyrdom was going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has drawn those curtains?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe room is close enough, as it is, without keeping the air out of it\r\nin that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe advanced to the curtains. At the moment when she laid her hand on\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94at the moment when the discovery of me appeared to be quite\r\ninevitable\xe2\x80\x94the voice of the fresh-coloured young footman, on the\r\nstairs, suddenly suspended any further proceedings on her side or on\r\nmine. It was unmistakably the voice of a man in great alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Rachel!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you, Miss Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sprang back from the curtains, and ran to the door.\r\n\r\nThe footman came just inside the room. His ruddy colour was all gone.\r\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease to come downstairs, Miss! My lady has fainted, and we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bring her to again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment more I was alone, and free to go downstairs in my turn,\r\nquite unobserved.\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey passed me in the hall, hurrying out, to fetch the doctor.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in, and help them!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the room. I found Rachel\r\non her knees by the sofa, with her mother\xe2\x80\x99s head on her bosom. One look\r\nat my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s face (knowing what I knew) was enough to warn me of the\r\ndreadful truth. I kept my thoughts to myself till the doctor came in.\r\nIt was not long before he arrived. He began by sending Rachel out of\r\nthe room\xe2\x80\x94and then he told the rest of us that Lady Verinder was no\r\nmore. Serious persons, in search of proofs of hardened scepticism, may\r\nbe interested in hearing that he showed no signs of remorse when he\r\nlooked at Me.\r\n\r\nAt a later hour I peeped into the breakfast-room, and the library. My\r\naunt had died without opening one of the letters which I had addressed\r\nto her. I was so shocked at this, that it never occurred to me, until\r\nsome days afterwards, that she had also died without giving me my\r\nlittle legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n(1.) \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack presents her compliments to Mr. Franklin Blake; and,\r\nin sending him the fifth chapter of her humble narrative, begs to say\r\nthat she feels quite unequal to enlarge as she could wish on an event\r\nso awful, under the circumstances, as Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s death. She has,\r\ntherefore, attached to her own manuscripts, copious Extracts from\r\nprecious publications in her possession, all bearing on this terrible\r\nsubject. And may those Extracts (Miss Clack fervently hopes) sound as\r\nthe blast of a trumpet in the ears of her respected kinsman, Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(2.) \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin Blake presents his compliments to Miss Clack, and\r\nbegs to thank her for the fifth chapter of her narrative. In returning\r\nthe extracts sent with it, he will refrain from mentioning any personal\r\nobjection which he may entertain to this species of literature, and\r\nwill merely say that the proposed additions to the manuscript are not\r\nnecessary to the fulfilment of the purpose that he has in view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(3.) \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack begs to acknowledge the return of her Extracts. She\r\naffectionately reminds Mr. Franklin Blake that she is a Christian, and\r\nthat it is, therefore, quite impossible for him to offend her. Miss C.\r\npersists in feeling the deepest interest in Mr. Blake, and pledges\r\nherself, on the first occasion when sickness may lay him low, to offer\r\nhim the use of her Extracts for the second time. In the meanwhile she\r\nwould be glad to know, before beginning the final chapters of her\r\nnarrative, whether she may be permitted to make her humble contribution\r\ncomplete, by availing herself of the light which later discoveries have\r\nthrown on the mystery of the Moonstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(4.) \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin Blake is sorry to disappoint Miss Clack. He can only\r\nrepeat the instructions which he had the honour of giving her when she\r\nbegan her narrative. She is requested to limit herself to her own\r\nindividual experience of persons and events, as recorded in her diary.\r\nLater discoveries she will be good enough to leave to the pens of those\r\npersons who can write in the capacity of actual witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(5.) \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack is extremely sorry to trouble Mr. Franklin Blake with\r\nanother letter. Her Extracts have been returned, and the expression of\r\nher matured views on the subject of the Moonstone has been forbidden.\r\nMiss Clack is painfully conscious that she ought (in the worldly\r\nphrase) to feel herself put down. But, no\xe2\x80\x94Miss C. has learnt\r\nPerseverance in the School of Adversity. Her object in writing is to\r\nknow whether Mr. Blake (who prohibits everything else) prohibits the\r\nappearance of the present correspondence in Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x99s narrative?\r\nSome explanation of the position in which Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s interference has\r\nplaced her as an authoress, seems due on the ground of common justice.\r\nAnd Miss Clack, on her side, is most anxious that her letters should be\r\nproduced to speak for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(6.) \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin Blake agrees to Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, on the\r\nunderstanding that she will kindly consider this intimation of his\r\nconsent as closing the correspondence between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(7.) \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack feels it an act of Christian duty (before the\r\ncorrespondence closes) to inform Mr. Franklin Blake that his last\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94evidently intended to offend her\xe2\x80\x94has not succeeded in\r\naccomplishing the object of the writer. She affectionately requests Mr.\r\nBlake to retire to the privacy of his own room, and to consider with\r\nhimself whether the training which can thus elevate a poor weak woman\r\nabove the reach of insult, be not worthy of greater admiration than he\r\nis now disposed to feel for it. On being favoured with an intimation to\r\nthat effect, Miss C. solemnly pledges herself to send back the complete\r\nseries of her Extracts to Mr. Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[To this letter no answer was received. Comment is needless.\r\n\r\n(Signed) DRUSILLA CLACK.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe foregoing correspondence will sufficiently explain why no choice is\r\nleft to me but to pass over Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s death with the simple\r\nannouncement of the fact which ends my fifth chapter.\r\n\r\nKeeping myself for the future strictly within the limits of my own\r\npersonal experience, I have next to relate that a month elapsed from\r\nthe time of my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s decease before Rachel Verinder and I met again.\r\nThat meeting was the occasion of my spending a few days under the same\r\nroof with her. In the course of my visit, something happened, relative\r\nto her marriage-engagement with Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite, which is\r\nimportant enough to require special notice in these pages. When this\r\nlast of many painful family circumstances has been disclosed, my task\r\nwill be completed; for I shall then have told all that I know, as an\r\nactual (and most unwilling) witness of events.\r\n\r\nMy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s remains were removed from London, and were buried in the\r\nlittle cemetery attached to the church in her own park. I was invited\r\nto the funeral with the rest of the family. But it was impossible (with\r\nmy religious views) to rouse myself in a few days only from the shock\r\nwhich this death had caused me. I was informed, moreover, that the\r\nrector of Frizinghall was to read the service. Having myself in past\r\ntimes seen this clerical castaway making one of the players at Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s whist-table, I doubt, even if I had been fit to travel,\r\nwhether I should have felt justified in attending the ceremony.\r\n\r\nLady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s death left her daughter under the care of her\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Ablewhite the elder. He was appointed guardian by\r\nthe will, until his niece married, or came of age. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Godfrey informed his father, I suppose, of the new\r\nrelation in which he stood towards Rachel. At any rate, in ten days\r\nfrom my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s death, the secret of the marriage-engagement was no\r\nsecret at all within the circle of the family, and the grand question\r\nfor Mr. Ablewhite senior\xe2\x80\x94another confirmed castaway!\xe2\x80\x94was how to make\r\nhimself and his authority most agreeable to the wealthy young lady who\r\nwas going to marry his son.\r\n\r\nRachel gave him some trouble at the outset, about the choice of a place\r\nin which she could be prevailed upon to reside. The house in Montagu\r\nSquare was associated with the calamity of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death. The\r\nhouse in Yorkshire was associated with the scandalous affair of the\r\nlost Moonstone. Her guardian\xe2\x80\x99s own residence at Frizinghall was open to\r\nneither of these objections. But Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s presence in it, after her\r\nrecent bereavement, operated as a check on the gaieties of her cousins,\r\nthe Miss Ablewhites\xe2\x80\x94and she herself requested that her visit might be\r\ndeferred to a more favourable opportunity. It ended in a proposal,\r\nemanating from old Mr. Ablewhite, to try a furnished house at Brighton.\r\nHis wife, an invalid daughter, and Rachel were to inhabit it together,\r\nand were to expect him to join them later in the season. They would see\r\nno society but a few old friends, and they would have his son Godfrey,\r\ntravelling backwards and forwards by the London train, always at their\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nI describe this aimless flitting about from one place of residence to\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x94this insatiate restlessness of body and appalling stagnation of\r\nsoul\xe2\x80\x94merely with the view to arriving at results. The event which\r\n(under Providence) proved to be the means of bringing Rachel Verinder\r\nand myself together again, was no other than the hiring of the house at\r\nBrighton.\r\n\r\nMy Aunt Ablewhite is a large, silent, fair-complexioned woman, with one\r\nnoteworthy point in her character. From the hour of her birth she has\r\nnever been known to do anything for herself. She has gone through life,\r\naccepting everybody\xe2\x80\x99s help, and adopting everybody\xe2\x80\x99s opinions. A more\r\nhopeless person, in a spiritual point of view, I have never met\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94there is absolutely, in this perplexing case, no obstructive\r\nmaterial to work upon. Aunt Ablewhite would listen to the Grand Lama of\r\nThibet exactly as she listens to Me, and would reflect his views quite\r\nas readily as she reflects mine. She found the furnished house at\r\nBrighton by stopping at an hotel in London, composing herself on a\r\nsofa, and sending for her son. She discovered the necessary servants by\r\nbreakfasting in bed one morning (still at the hotel), and giving her\r\nmaid a holiday on condition that the girl \xe2\x80\x9cwould begin enjoying herself\r\nby fetching Miss Clack.\xe2\x80\x9d I found her placidly fanning herself in her\r\ndressing-gown at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cDrusilla, dear, I want some servants.\r\nYou are so clever\xe2\x80\x94please get them for me.\xe2\x80\x9d I looked round the untidy\r\nroom. The church-bells were going for a week-day service; they\r\nsuggested a word of affectionate remonstrance on my part. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs _this_ worthy of a Christian Englishwoman? Is the\r\npassage from time to eternity to be made in _this_ manner?\xe2\x80\x9d My aunt\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put on my gown, Drusilla, if you will be kind enough to\r\nhelp me.\xe2\x80\x9d What was to be said after that? I have done wonders with\r\nmurderesses\xe2\x80\x94I have never advanced an inch with Aunt Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nis the list,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cof the servants whom you require?\xe2\x80\x9d My aunt\r\nshook her head; she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even energy enough to keep the list. \xe2\x80\x9cRachel\r\nhas got it, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cin the next room.\xe2\x80\x9d I went into the next\r\nroom, and so saw Rachel again for the first time since we had parted in\r\nMontagu Square.\r\n\r\nShe looked pitiably small and thin in her deep mourning. If I attached\r\nany serious importance to such a perishable trifle as personal\r\nappearance, I might be inclined to add that hers was one of those\r\nunfortunate complexions which always suffer when not relieved by a\r\nborder of white next the skin. But what are our complexions and our\r\nlooks? Hindrances and pitfalls, dear girls, which beset us on our way\r\nto higher things! Greatly to my surprise, Rachel rose when I entered\r\nthe room, and came forward to meet me with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDrusilla, I have been in the habit\r\nof speaking very foolishly and very rudely to you, on former occasions.\r\nI beg your pardon. I hope you will forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy face, I suppose, betrayed the astonishment I felt at this. She\r\ncoloured up for a moment, and then proceeded to explain herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cher friends were not\r\nalways my friends, too. Now I have lost her, my heart turns for comfort\r\nto the people she liked. She liked you. Try to be friends with me,\r\nDrusilla, if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo any rightly-constituted mind, the motive thus acknowledged was\r\nsimply shocking. Here in Christian England was a young woman in a state\r\nof bereavement, with so little idea of where to look for true comfort,\r\nthat she actually expected to find it among her mother\xe2\x80\x99s friends! Here\r\nwas a relative of mine, awakened to a sense of her shortcomings towards\r\nothers, under the influence, not of conviction and duty, but of\r\nsentiment and impulse! Most deplorable to think of\xe2\x80\x94but, still,\r\nsuggestive of something hopeful, to a person of my experience in plying\r\nthe good work. There could be no harm, I thought, in ascertaining the\r\nextent of the change which the loss of her mother had wrought in\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s character. I decided, as a useful test, to probe her on the\r\nsubject of her marriage-engagement to Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\r\n\r\nHaving first met her advances with all possible cordiality, I sat by\r\nher on the sofa, at her own request. We discussed family affairs and\r\nfuture plans\xe2\x80\x94always excepting that one future plan which was to end in\r\nher marriage. Try as I might to turn the conversation that way, she\r\nresolutely declined to take the hint. Any open reference to the\r\nquestion, on my part, would have been premature at this early stage of\r\nour reconciliation. Besides, I had discovered all I wanted to know. She\r\nwas no longer the reckless, defiant creature whom I had heard and seen,\r\non the occasion of my martyrdom in Montagu Square. This was, of itself,\r\nenough to encourage me to take her future conversion in hand\xe2\x80\x94beginning\r\nwith a few words of earnest warning directed against the hasty\r\nformation of the marriage tie, and so getting on to higher things.\r\nLooking at her, now, with this new interest\xe2\x80\x94and calling to mind the\r\nheadlong suddenness with which she had met Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s matrimonial\r\nviews\xe2\x80\x94I felt the solemn duty of interfering with a fervour which\r\nassured me that I should achieve no common results. Rapidity of\r\nproceeding was, as I believed, of importance in this case. I went back\r\nat once to the question of the servants wanted for the furnished house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the list, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel produced it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCook, kitchen-maid, housemaid, and footman,\xe2\x80\x9d I read. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Rachel,\r\nthese servants are only wanted for a term\xe2\x80\x94the term during which your\r\nguardian has taken the house. We shall have great difficulty in finding\r\npersons of character and capacity to accept a temporary engagement of\r\nthat sort, if we try in London. Has the house in Brighton been found\r\nyet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Godfrey has taken it; and persons in the house wanted him to hire\r\nthem as servants. He thought they would hardly do for us, and came back\r\nhaving settled nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have no experience yourself in these matters, Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Aunt Ablewhite won\xe2\x80\x99t exert herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, poor dear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her, Drusilla. I think she is the only\r\nreally happy woman I have ever met with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are degrees in happiness, darling. We must have a little talk,\r\nsome day, on that subject. In the meantime I will undertake to meet the\r\ndifficulty about the servants. Your aunt will write a letter to the\r\npeople of the house\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will sign a letter, if I write it for her, which comes to the same\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the same thing. I shall get the letter, and I will go to\r\nBrighton tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow extremely kind of you! We will join you as soon as you are ready\r\nfor us. And you will stay, I hope, as _my_ guest. Brighton is so\r\nlively; you are sure to enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those words the invitation was given, and the glorious prospect of\r\ninterference was opened before me.\r\n\r\nIt was then the middle of the week. By Saturday afternoon the house was\r\nready for them. In that short interval I had sifted, not the characters\r\nonly, but the religious views as well, of all the disengaged servants\r\nwho applied to me, and had succeeded in making a selection which my\r\nconscience approved. I also discovered, and called on two serious\r\nfriends of mine, residents in the town, to whom I knew I could confide\r\nthe pious object which had brought me to Brighton. One of them\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nclerical friend\xe2\x80\x94kindly helped me to take sittings for our little party\r\nin the church in which he himself ministered. The other\xe2\x80\x94a single lady,\r\nlike myself\xe2\x80\x94placed the resources of her library (composed throughout of\r\nprecious publications) entirely at my disposal. I borrowed half-a-dozen\r\nworks, all carefully chosen with a view to Rachel. When these had been\r\njudiciously distributed in the various rooms she would be likely to\r\noccupy, I considered that my preparations were complete. Sound doctrine\r\nin the servants who waited on her; sound doctrine in the minister who\r\npreached to her; sound doctrine in the books that lay on her table\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nwas the treble welcome which my zeal had prepared for the motherless\r\ngirl! A heavenly composure filled my mind, on that Saturday afternoon,\r\nas I sat at the window waiting the arrival of my relatives. The giddy\r\nthrong passed and repassed before my eyes. Alas! how many of them felt\r\nmy exquisite sense of duty done? An awful question. Let us not pursue\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBetween six and seven the travellers arrived. To my indescribable\r\nsurprise, they were escorted, not by Mr. Godfrey (as I had\r\nanticipated), but by the lawyer, Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Miss Clack?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to stay this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat reference to the occasion on which I had obliged him to postpone\r\nhis business to mine, when we were both visiting in Montagu Square,\r\nsatisfied me that the old worldling had come to Brighton with some\r\nobject of his own in view. I had prepared quite a little Paradise for\r\nmy beloved Rachel\xe2\x80\x94and here was the Serpent already!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGodfrey was very much vexed, Drusilla, not to be able to come with\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x9d said my Aunt Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was something in the way which kept\r\nhim in town. Mr. Bruff volunteered to take his place, and make a\r\nholiday of it till Monday morning. By-the-bye, Mr. Bruff, I\xe2\x80\x99m ordered\r\nto take exercise, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. That,\xe2\x80\x9d added Aunt Ablewhite,\r\npointing out of window to an invalid going by in a chair on wheels,\r\ndrawn by a man, \xe2\x80\x9cis my idea of exercise. If it\xe2\x80\x99s air you want, you get\r\nit in your chair. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue you want, I am sure it\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue\r\nenough to look at the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel stood silent, at a window by herself, with her eyes fixed on the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired, love?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Only a little out of spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have often seen\r\nthe sea, on our Yorkshire coast, with that light on it. And I was\r\nthinking, Drusilla, of the days that can never come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff remained to dinner, and stayed through the evening. The more\r\nI saw of him, the more certain I felt that he had some private end to\r\nserve in coming to Brighton. I watched him carefully. He maintained the\r\nsame appearance of ease, and talked the same godless gossip, hour after\r\nhour, until it was time to take leave. As he shook hands with Rachel, I\r\ncaught his hard and cunning eyes resting on her for a moment with a\r\npeculiar interest and attention. She was plainly concerned in the\r\nobject that he had in view. He said nothing out of the common to her or\r\nto anyone on leaving. He invited himself to luncheon the next day, and\r\nthen he went away to his hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible the next morning to get my Aunt Ablewhite out of her\r\ndressing-gown in time for church. Her invalid daughter (suffering from\r\nnothing, in my opinion, but incurable laziness, inherited from her\r\nmother) announced that she meant to remain in bed for the day. Rachel\r\nand I went alone together to church. A magnificent sermon was preached\r\nby my gifted friend on the heathen indifference of the world to the\r\nsinfulness of little sins. For more than an hour his eloquence\r\n(assisted by his glorious voice) thundered through the sacred edifice.\r\nI said to Rachel, when we came out, \xe2\x80\x9cHas it found its way to your\r\nheart, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d And she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo; it has only made my head ache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThis might have been discouraging to some people; but, once embarked on\r\na career of manifest usefulness, nothing discourages Me.\r\n\r\nWe found Aunt Ablewhite and Mr. Bruff at luncheon. When Rachel declined\r\neating anything, and gave as a reason for it that she was suffering\r\nfrom a headache, the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s cunning instantly saw, and seized, the\r\nchance that she had given him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one remedy for a headache,\xe2\x80\x9d said this horrible old man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA walk, Miss Rachel, is the thing to cure you. I am entirely at your\r\nservice, if you will honour me by accepting my arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the greatest pleasure. A walk is the very thing I was longing\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s past two,\xe2\x80\x9d I gently suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the afternoon service,\r\nRachel, begins at three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you expect me to go to church again,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, petulantly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith such a headache as mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff officiously opened the door for her. In another minute more\r\nthey were both out of the house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I have felt the\r\nsolemn duty of interfering so strongly as I felt it at that moment. But\r\nwhat was to be done? Nothing was to be done but to interfere at the\r\nfirst opportunity, later in the day.\r\n\r\nOn my return from the afternoon service I found that they had just got\r\nback. One look at them told me that the lawyer had said what he wanted\r\nto say. I had never before seen Rachel so silent and so thoughtful. I\r\nhad never before seen Mr. Bruff pay her such devoted attention, and\r\nlook at her with such marked respect. He had (or pretended that he had)\r\nan engagement to dinner that day\xe2\x80\x94and he took an early leave of us all;\r\nintending to go back to London by the first train the next morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of your own resolution?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Rachel at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\xe2\x80\x94and so they parted.\r\n\r\nThe moment his back was turned, Rachel withdrew to her own room. She\r\nnever appeared at dinner. Her maid (the person with the cap-ribbons)\r\nwas sent downstairs to announce that her headache had returned. I ran\r\nup to her and made all sorts of sisterly offers through the door. It\r\nwas locked, and she kept it locked. Plenty of obstructive material to\r\nwork on here! I felt greatly cheered and stimulated by her locking the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nWhen her cup of tea went up to her the next morning, I followed it in.\r\nI sat by her bedside and said a few earnest words. She listened with\r\nlanguid civility. I noticed my serious friend\xe2\x80\x99s precious publications\r\nhuddled together on a table in a corner. Had she chanced to look into\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x94I asked. Yes\xe2\x80\x94and they had not interested her. Would she allow me\r\nto read a few passages of the deepest interest, which had probably\r\nescaped her eye? No, not now\xe2\x80\x94she had other things to think of. She gave\r\nthese answers, with her attention apparently absorbed in folding and\r\nrefolding the frilling on her nightgown. It was plainly necessary to\r\nrouse her by some reference to those worldly interests which she still\r\nhad at heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, love,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had an odd fancy, yesterday, about Mr.\r\nBruff? I thought, when I saw you after your walk with him, that he had\r\nbeen telling you some bad news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer fingers dropped from the frilling of her nightgown, and her fierce\r\nblack eyes flashed at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was news I was interested in\r\nhearing\xe2\x80\x94and I am deeply indebted to Mr. Bruff for telling me of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in a tone of gentle interest.\r\n\r\nHer fingers went back to the frilling, and she turned her head sullenly\r\naway from me. I had been met in this manner, in the course of plying\r\nthe good work, hundreds of times. She merely stimulated me to try\r\nagain. In my dauntless zeal for her welfare, I ran the great risk, and\r\nopenly alluded to her marriage engagement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews you were interested in hearing?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, my dear\r\nRachel, that must be news of Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started up in the bed, and turned deadly pale. It was evidently on\r\nthe tip of her tongue to retort on me with the unbridled insolence of\r\nformer times. She checked herself\xe2\x80\x94laid her head back on the\r\npillow\xe2\x80\x94considered a minute\xe2\x80\x94and then answered in these remarkable words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I shall never marry Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to start at that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you possibly mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe marriage is considered\r\nby the whole family as a settled thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Godfrey Ablewhite is expected here today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said doggedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till he comes\xe2\x80\x94and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear Rachel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell at the head of her bed. The person with the\r\ncap-ribbons appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPenelope! my bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLet me give her her due. In the state of my feelings at that moment, I\r\ndo sincerely believe that she had hit on the only possible way of\r\nforcing me to leave the room.\r\n\r\nBy the mere worldly mind my position towards Rachel might have been\r\nviewed as presenting difficulties of no ordinary kind. I had reckoned\r\non leading her to higher things by means of a little earnest\r\nexhortation on the subject of her marriage. And now, if she was to be\r\nbelieved, no such event as her marriage was to take place at all. But\r\nah, my friends! a working Christian of my experience (with an\r\nevangelising prospect before her) takes broader views than these.\r\nSupposing Rachel really broke off the marriage, on which the\r\nAblewhites, father and son, counted as a settled thing, what would be\r\nthe result? It could only end, if she held firm, in an exchanging of\r\nhard words and bitter accusations on both sides. And what would be the\r\neffect on Rachel when the stormy interview was over? A salutary moral\r\ndepression would be the effect. Her pride would be exhausted, her\r\nstubbornness would be exhausted, by the resolute resistance which it\r\nwas in her character to make under the circumstances. She would turn\r\nfor sympathy to the nearest person who had sympathy to offer. And I was\r\nthat nearest person\xe2\x80\x94brimful of comfort, charged to overflowing with\r\nseasonable and reviving words. Never had the evangelising prospect\r\nlooked brighter, to _my_ eyes, than it looked now.\r\n\r\nShe came down to breakfast, but she ate nothing, and hardly uttered a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast she wandered listlessly from room to room\xe2\x80\x94then suddenly\r\nroused herself, and opened the piano. The music she selected to play\r\nwas of the most scandalously profane sort, associated with performances\r\non the stage which it curdles one\xe2\x80\x99s blood to think of. It would have\r\nbeen premature to interfere with her at such a time as this. I\r\nprivately ascertained the hour at which Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was\r\nexpected, and then I escaped the music by leaving the house.\r\n\r\nBeing out alone, I took the opportunity of calling upon my two resident\r\nfriends. It was an indescribable luxury to find myself indulging in\r\nearnest conversation with serious persons. Infinitely encouraged and\r\nrefreshed, I turned my steps back again to the house, in excellent time\r\nto await the arrival of our expected visitor. I entered the\r\ndining-room, always empty at that hour of the day, and found myself\r\nface to face with Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite!\r\n\r\nHe made no attempt to fly the place. Quite the contrary. He advanced to\r\nmeet me with the utmost eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Clack, I have been only waiting to see _you!_ Chance set me\r\nfree of my London engagements today sooner than I had expected, and I\r\nhave got here, in consequence, earlier than my appointed time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot the slightest embarrassment encumbered his explanation, though this\r\nwas his first meeting with me after the scene in Montagu Square. He was\r\nnot aware, it is true, of my having been a witness of that scene. But\r\nhe knew, on the other hand, that my attendances at the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSmall-Clothes, and my relations with friends attached to other\r\ncharities, must have informed me of his shameless neglect of his Ladies\r\nand of his Poor. And yet there he was before me, in full possession of\r\nhis charming voice and his irresistible smile!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Rachel yet?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe sighed gently, and took me by the hand. I should certainly have\r\nsnatched my hand away, if the manner in which he gave his answer had\r\nnot paralysed me with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with perfect tranquillity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\naware, dear friend, that she was engaged to me? Well, she has taken a\r\nsudden resolution to break the engagement. Reflection has convinced her\r\nthat she will best consult her welfare and mine by retracting a rash\r\npromise, and leaving me free to make some happier choice elsewhere.\r\nThat is the only reason she will give, and the only answer she will\r\nmake to every question that I can ask of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done on your side?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you submitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with the most unruffled composure, \xe2\x80\x9cI have submitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis conduct, under the circumstances, was so utterly inconceivable,\r\nthat I stood bewildered with my hand in his. It is a piece of rudeness\r\nto stare at anybody, and it is an act of indelicacy to stare at a\r\ngentleman. I committed both those improprieties. And I said, as if in a\r\ndream, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose we sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led me to a chair. I have an indistinct remembrance that he was very\r\naffectionate. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he put his arm round my waist to support\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94but I am not sure. I was quite helpless, and his ways with ladies\r\nwere very endearing. At any rate, we sat down. I can answer for that,\r\nif I can answer for nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lost a beautiful girl, an excellent social position, and a\r\nhandsome income,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Godfrey began; \xe2\x80\x9cand I have submitted to it\r\nwithout a struggle. What can be the motive for such extraordinary\r\nconduct as that? My precious friend, there is no motive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo motive?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me appeal, my dear Miss Clack, to your experience of children,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cA child pursues a certain course of conduct. You are greatly\r\nstruck by it, and you attempt to get at the motive. The dear little\r\nthing is incapable of telling you its motive. You might as well ask the\r\ngrass why it grows, or the birds why they sing. Well! in this matter, I\r\nam like the dear little thing\xe2\x80\x94like the grass\xe2\x80\x94like the birds. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow why I made a proposal of marriage to Miss Verinder. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhy I have shamefully neglected my dear Ladies. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I have\r\napostatised from the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99 Small-Clothes. You say to the child, Why\r\nhave you been naughty? And the little angel puts its finger into its\r\nmouth, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know. My case exactly, Miss Clack! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconfess it to anybody else. I feel impelled to confess it to _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to recover myself. A mental problem was involved here. I am\r\ndeeply interested in mental problems\xe2\x80\x94and I am not, it is thought,\r\nwithout some skill in solving them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBest of friends, exert your intellect, and help me,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me\xe2\x80\x94why does a time come when these matrimonial proceedings of\r\nmine begin to look like something done in a dream? Why does it suddenly\r\noccur to me that my true happiness is in helping my dear Ladies, in\r\ngoing my modest round of useful work, in saying my few earnest words\r\nwhen called on by my Chairman? What do I want with a position? I have\r\ngot a position! What do I want with an income? I can pay for my bread\r\nand cheese, and my nice little lodging, and my two coats a year. What\r\ndo I want with Miss Verinder? She has told me with her own lips (this,\r\ndear lady, is between ourselves) that she loves another man, and that\r\nher only idea in marrying me is to try and put that other man out of\r\nher head. What a horrid union is this! Oh, dear me, what a horrid union\r\nis this! Such are my reflections, Miss Clack, on my way to Brighton. I\r\napproach Rachel with the feeling of a criminal who is going to receive\r\nhis sentence. When I find that she has changed her mind too\xe2\x80\x94when I hear\r\nher propose to break the engagement\xe2\x80\x94I experience (there is no sort of\r\ndoubt about it) a most overpowering sense of relief. A month ago I was\r\npressing her rapturously to my bosom. An hour ago, the happiness of\r\nknowing that I shall never press her again, intoxicates me like strong\r\nliquor. The thing seems impossible\xe2\x80\x94the thing can\xe2\x80\x99t be. And yet there\r\nare the facts, as I had the honour of stating them when we first sat\r\ndown together in these two chairs. I have lost a beautiful girl, an\r\nexcellent social position, and a handsome income; and I have submitted\r\nto it without a struggle. Can _you_ account for it, dear friend? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite beyond _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis magnificent head sank on his breast, and he gave up his own mental\r\nproblem in despair.\r\n\r\nI was deeply touched. The case (if I may speak as a spiritual\r\nphysician) was now quite plain to me. It is no uncommon event, in the\r\nexperience of us all, to see the possessors of exalted ability\r\noccasionally humbled to the level of the most poorly-gifted people\r\nabout them. The object, no doubt, in the wise economy of Providence, is\r\nto remind greatness that it is mortal and that the power which has\r\nconferred it can also take it away. It was now\xe2\x80\x94to my mind\xe2\x80\x94easy to\r\ndiscern one of these salutary humiliations in the deplorable\r\nproceedings on dear Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s part, of which I had been the unseen\r\nwitness. And it was equally easy to recognise the welcome reappearance\r\nof his own finer nature in the horror with which he recoiled from the\r\nidea of a marriage with Rachel, and in the charming eagerness which he\r\nshowed to return to his Ladies and his Poor.\r\n\r\nI put this view before him in a few simple and sisterly words. His joy\r\nwas beautiful to see. He compared himself, as I went on, to a lost man\r\nemerging from the darkness into the light. When I answered for a loving\r\nreception of him at the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99 Small-Clothes, the grateful heart of\r\nour Christian Hero overflowed. He pressed my hands alternately to his\r\nlips. Overwhelmed by the exquisite triumph of having got him back among\r\nus, I let him do what he liked with my hands. I closed my eyes. I felt\r\nmy head, in an ecstasy of spiritual self-forgetfulness, sinking on his\r\nshoulder. In a moment more I should certainly have swooned away in his\r\narms, but for an interruption from the outer world, which brought me to\r\nmyself again. A horrid rattling of knives and forks sounded outside the\r\ndoor, and the footman came in to lay the table for luncheon.\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey started up, and looked at the clock on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow time flies with _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall barely catch the\r\ntrain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI ventured on asking why he was in such a hurry to get back to town.\r\nHis answer reminded me of family difficulties that were still to be\r\nreconciled, and of family disagreements that were yet to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard from my father,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness obliges him to leave\r\nFrizinghall for London today, and he proposes coming on here, either\r\nthis evening or tomorrow. I must tell him what has happened between\r\nRachel and me. His heart is set on our marriage\xe2\x80\x94there will be great\r\ndifficulty, I fear, in reconciling him to the breaking-off of the\r\nengagement. I must stop him, for all our sakes, from coming here till\r\nhe _is_ reconciled. Best and dearest of friends, we shall meet again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he hurried out. In equal haste on my side, I ran\r\nupstairs to compose myself in my own room before meeting Aunt Ablewhite\r\nand Rachel at the luncheon-table.\r\n\r\nI am well aware\xe2\x80\x94to dwell for a moment yet on the subject of Mr.\r\nGodfrey\xe2\x80\x94that the all-profaning opinion of the world has charged him\r\nwith having his own private reasons for releasing Rachel from her\r\nengagement, at the first opportunity she gave him. It has also reached\r\nmy ears, that his anxiety to recover his place in my estimation has\r\nbeen attributed in certain quarters, to a mercenary eagerness to make\r\nhis peace (through me) with a venerable committee-woman at the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSmall-Clothes, abundantly blessed with the goods of this world, and a\r\nbeloved and intimate friend of my own. I only notice these odious\r\nslanders for the sake of declaring that they never had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence on my mind. In obedience to my instructions, I have exhibited\r\nthe fluctuations in my opinion of our Christian Hero, exactly as I find\r\nthem recorded in my diary. In justice to myself, let me here add that,\r\nonce reinstated in his place in my estimation, my gifted friend never\r\nlost that place again. I write with the tears in my eyes, burning to\r\nsay more. But no\xe2\x80\x94I am cruelly limited to my actual experience of\r\npersons and things. In less than a month from the time of which I am\r\nnow writing, events in the money-market (which diminished even _my_\r\nmiserable little income) forced me into foreign exile, and left me with\r\nnothing but a loving remembrance of Mr. Godfrey which the slander of\r\nthe world has assailed, and assailed in vain.\r\n\r\nLet me dry my eyes, and return to my narrative.\r\n\r\nI went downstairs to luncheon, naturally anxious to see how Rachel was\r\naffected by her release from her marriage engagement.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me\xe2\x80\x94but I own I am a poor authority in such matters\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthe recovery of her freedom had set her thinking again of that other\r\nman whom she loved, and that she was furious with herself for not being\r\nable to control a revulsion of feeling of which she was secretly\r\nashamed. Who was the man? I had my suspicions\xe2\x80\x94but it was needless to\r\nwaste time in idle speculation. When I had converted her, she would, as\r\na matter of course, have no concealments from Me. I should hear all\r\nabout the man; I should hear all about the Moonstone. If I had had no\r\nhigher object in stirring her up to a sense of spiritual things, the\r\nmotive of relieving her mind of its guilty secrets would have been\r\nenough of itself to encourage me to go on.\r\n\r\nAunt Ablewhite took her exercise in the afternoon in an invalid chair.\r\nRachel accompanied her. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could drag the chair,\xe2\x80\x9d she broke out,\r\nrecklessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could fatigue myself till I was ready to drop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in the same humour in the evening. I discovered in one of my\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s precious publications\xe2\x80\x94the _Life, Letters, and Labours of Miss\r\nJane Ann Stamper_, forty-fourth edition\xe2\x80\x94passages which bore with a\r\nmarvellous appropriateness on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s present position. Upon my\r\nproposing to read them, she went to the piano. Conceive how little she\r\nmust have known of serious people, if she supposed that my patience was\r\nto be exhausted in that way! I kept Miss Jane Ann Stamper by me, and\r\nwaited for events with the most unfaltering trust in the future.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Ablewhite never made his appearance that night. But I knew the\r\nimportance which his worldly greed attached to his son\xe2\x80\x99s marriage with\r\nMiss Verinder\xe2\x80\x94and I felt a positive conviction (do what Mr. Godfrey\r\nmight to prevent it) that we should see him the next day. With his\r\ninterference in the matter, the storm on which I had counted would\r\ncertainly come, and the salutary exhaustion of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s resisting\r\npowers would as certainly follow. I am not ignorant that old Mr.\r\nAblewhite has the reputation generally (especially among his inferiors)\r\nof being a remarkably good-natured man. According to my observation of\r\nhim, he deserves his reputation as long as he has his own way, and not\r\na moment longer.\r\n\r\nThe next day, exactly as I had foreseen, Aunt Ablewhite was as near to\r\nbeing astonished as her nature would permit, by the sudden appearance\r\nof her husband. He had barely been a minute in the house, before he was\r\nfollowed, to _my_ astonishment this time, by an unexpected complication\r\nin the shape of Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\nI never remember feeling the presence of the lawyer to be more\r\nunwelcome than I felt it at that moment. He looked ready for anything\r\nin the way of an obstructive proceeding\xe2\x80\x94capable even of keeping the\r\npeace with Rachel for one of the combatants!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pleasant surprise, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ablewhite, addressing\r\nhimself with his deceptive cordiality to Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I left your\r\noffice yesterday, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to have the honour of seeing you at\r\nBrighton today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI turned over our conversation in my mind, after you had gone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it occurred to me that I might perhaps be of\r\nsome use on this occasion. I was just in time to catch the train, and I\r\nhad no opportunity of discovering the carriage in which you were\r\ntravelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving given that explanation, he seated himself by Rachel. I retired\r\nmodestly to a corner\xe2\x80\x94with Miss Jane Ann Stamper on my lap, in case of\r\nemergency. My aunt sat at the window; placidly fanning herself as\r\nusual. Mr. Ablewhite stood up in the middle of the room, with his bald\r\nhead much pinker than I had ever seen it yet, and addressed himself in\r\nthe most affectionate manner to his niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRachel, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard some very extraordinary news\r\nfrom Godfrey. And I am here to inquire about it. You have a\r\nsitting-room of your own in this house. Will you honour me by showing\r\nme the way to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel never moved. Whether she was determined to bring matters to a\r\ncrisis, or whether she was prompted by some private sign from Mr.\r\nBruff, is more than I can tell. She declined doing old Mr. Ablewhite\r\nthe honour of conducting him into her sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you wish to say to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9ccan be said here\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe presence of my relatives, and in the presence\xe2\x80\x9d (she looked at Mr.\r\nBruff) \xe2\x80\x9cof my mother\xe2\x80\x99s trusted old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the amiable Mr. Ablewhite. He took\r\na chair. The rest of them looked at his face\xe2\x80\x94as if they expected it,\r\nafter seventy years of worldly training, to speak the truth. I looked\r\nat the top of his bald head; having noticed on other occasions that the\r\ntemper which was really in him had a habit of registering itself\r\n_there_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome weeks ago,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cmy son informed me that\r\nMiss Verinder had done him the honour to engage herself to marry him.\r\nIs it possible, Rachel, that he can have misinterpreted\xe2\x80\x94or presumed\r\nupon\xe2\x80\x94what you really said to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI did engage myself to marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery frankly answered!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd most satisfactory, my\r\ndear, so far. In respect to what happened some weeks since, Godfrey has\r\nmade no mistake. The error is evidently in what he told me yesterday. I\r\nbegin to see it now. You and he have had a lovers\xe2\x80\x99 quarrel\xe2\x80\x94and my\r\nfoolish son has interpreted it seriously. Ah! I should have known\r\nbetter than that at his age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fallen nature in Rachel\xe2\x80\x94the mother Eve, so to speak\xe2\x80\x94began to chafe\r\nat this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray let us understand each other, Mr. Ablewhite,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\nin the least like a quarrel took place yesterday between your son and\r\nme. If he told you that I proposed breaking off our marriage\r\nengagement, and that he agreed on his side\xe2\x80\x94he told you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe self-registering thermometer at the top of Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s bald\r\nhead began to indicate a rise of temper. His face was more amiable than\r\never\xe2\x80\x94but _there_ was the pink at the top of his face, a shade deeper\r\nalready!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his most soothing manner, \xe2\x80\x9cnow don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe angry, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on poor Godfrey! He has evidently said some\r\nunfortunate thing. He was always clumsy from a child\xe2\x80\x94but he means well,\r\nRachel, he means well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Ablewhite, I have either expressed myself very badly, or you are\r\npurposely mistaking me. Once for all, it is a settled thing between\r\nyour son and myself that we remain, for the rest of our lives, cousins\r\nand nothing more. Is that plain enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which she said those words made it impossible, even for old\r\nMr. Ablewhite, to mistake her any longer. His thermometer went up\r\nanother degree, and his voice when he next spoke, ceased to be the\r\nvoice which is appropriate to a notoriously good-natured man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to understand, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your marriage engagement is\r\nbroken off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to understand that, Mr. Ablewhite, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am also to take it as a matter of fact that the proposal to withdraw\r\nfrom the engagement came, in the first instance, from _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came, in the first instance, from me. And it met, as I have told\r\nyou, with your son\xe2\x80\x99s consent and approval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thermometer went up to the top of the register. I mean, the pink\r\nchanged suddenly to scarlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son is a mean-spirited hound!\xe2\x80\x9d cried this furious old worldling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn justice to myself as his father\xe2\x80\x94not in justice to _him_\xe2\x80\x94I beg to\r\nask you, Miss Verinder, what complaint you have to make of Mr. Godfrey\r\nAblewhite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Bruff interfered for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not bound to answer that question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Rachel.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Ablewhite fastened on him instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are a self-invited guest here.\r\nYour interference would have come with a better grace if you had waited\r\nuntil it was asked for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff took no notice. The smooth varnish on _his_ wicked old face\r\nnever cracked. Rachel thanked him for the advice he had given to her,\r\nand then turned to old Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x94preserving her composure in a\r\nmanner which (having regard to her age and her sex) was simply awful to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour son put the same question to me which you have just asked,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI had only one answer for him, and I have only one answer for\r\nyou. I proposed that we should release each other, because reflection\r\nhad convinced me that I should best consult his welfare and mine by\r\nretracting a rash promise, and leaving him free to make his choice\r\nelsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has my son done?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Mr. Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a right to\r\nknow that. What has my son done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe persisted just as obstinately on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had the only explanation which I think it necessary to give\r\nto you, or to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plain English, it\xe2\x80\x99s your sovereign will and pleasure, Miss\r\nVerinder, to jilt my son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel was silent for a moment. Sitting close behind her, I heard her\r\nsigh. Mr. Bruff took her hand, and gave it a little squeeze. She\r\nrecovered herself, and answered Mr. Ablewhite as boldly as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have exposed myself to worse misconstruction than that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have borne it patiently. The time has gone by, when you could\r\nmortify me by calling me a jilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a bitterness of tone which satisfied me that the scandal\r\nof the Moonstone had been in some way recalled to her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\r\nmore to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, wearily, not addressing the words to anyone in\r\nparticular, and looking away from us all, out of the window that was\r\nnearest to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Ablewhite got upon his feet, and pushed away his chair so violently\r\nthat it toppled over and fell on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something more to say on my side,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, bringing down\r\nthe flat of his hand on the table with a bang. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to say that if\r\nmy son doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel this insult, I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel started, and looked at him in sudden surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsult?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsult!\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Mr. Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cI know your motive, Miss Verinder,\r\nfor breaking your promise to my son! I know it as certainly as if you\r\nhad confessed it in so many words. Your cursed family pride is\r\ninsulting Godfrey, as it insulted _me_ when I married your aunt. Her\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x94her beggarly family\xe2\x80\x94turned their backs on her for marrying an\r\nhonest man, who had made his own place and won his own fortune. I had\r\nno ancestors. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t descended from a set of cut-throat scoundrels\r\nwho lived by robbery and murder. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t point to the time when the\r\nAblewhites hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a shirt to their backs, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign their own\r\nnames. Ha! ha! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for the Herncastles, when _I_\r\nmarried. And now, it comes to the pinch, my son isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for\r\n_you_. I suspected it, all along. You have got the Herncastle blood in\r\nyou, my young lady! I suspected it all along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very unworthy suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cI am astonished that\r\nyou have the courage to acknowledge it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Ablewhite could find words to answer in, Rachel spoke in a\r\ntone of the most exasperating contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is beneath notice. If he can\r\nthink in _that_ way, let us leave him to think as he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom scarlet, Mr. Ablewhite was now becoming purple. He gasped for\r\nbreath; he looked backwards and forwards from Rachel to Mr. Bruff in\r\nsuch a frenzy of rage with both of them that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know which to\r\nattack first. His wife, who had sat impenetrably fanning herself up to\r\nthis time, began to be alarmed, and attempted, quite uselessly, to\r\nquiet him. I had, throughout this distressing interview, felt more than\r\none inward call to interfere with a few earnest words, and had\r\ncontrolled myself under a dread of the possible results, very unworthy\r\nof a Christian Englishwoman who looks, not to what is meanly prudent,\r\nbut to what is morally right. At the point at which matters had now\r\narrived, I rose superior to all considerations of mere expediency. If I\r\nhad contemplated interposing any remonstrance of my own humble\r\ndevising, I might possibly have still hesitated. But the distressing\r\ndomestic emergency which now confronted me, was most marvellously and\r\nbeautifully provided for in the Correspondence of Miss Jane Ann\r\nStamper\xe2\x80\x94Letter one thousand and one, on \xe2\x80\x9cPeace in Families.\xe2\x80\x9d I rose in\r\nmy modest corner, and I opened my precious book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Ablewhite,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cone word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I first attracted the attention of the company by rising, I could\r\nsee that he was on the point of saying something rude to me. My\r\nsisterly form of address checked him. He stared at me in heathen\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs an affectionate well-wisher and friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cand as one\r\nlong accustomed to arouse, convince, prepare, enlighten, and fortify\r\nothers, permit me to take the most pardonable of all liberties\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nliberty of composing your mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to recover himself; he was on the point of breaking out\xe2\x80\x94he\r\n_would_ have broken out, with anybody else. But my voice (habitually\r\ngentle) possesses a high note or so, in emergencies. In this emergency,\r\nI felt imperatively called upon to have the highest voice of the two.\r\n\r\nI held up my precious book before him; I rapped the open page\r\nimpressively with my forefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cNot my words!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, in a\r\nburst of fervent interruption. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I claim\r\nattention for My humble words! Manna in the wilderness, Mr. Ablewhite!\r\nDew on the parched earth! Words of comfort, words of wisdom, words of\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x94the blessed, blessed, blessed words of Miss Jane Ann Stamper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was stopped there by a momentary impediment of the breath. Before I\r\ncould recover myself, this monster in human form shouted out furiously,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jane Ann Stamper be \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to write the awful word, which is here\r\nrepresented by a blank. I shrieked as it passed his lips; I flew to my\r\nlittle bag on the side table; I shook out all my tracts; I seized the\r\none particular tract on profane swearing, entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cHush, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSake!\xe2\x80\x9d; I handed it to him with an expression of agonised entreaty. He\r\ntore it in two, and threw it back at me across the table. The rest of\r\nthem rose in alarm, not knowing what might happen next. I instantly sat\r\ndown again in my corner. There had once been an occasion, under\r\nsomewhat similar circumstances, when Miss Jane Ann Stamper had been\r\ntaken by the two shoulders and turned out of a room. I waited, inspired\r\nby _her_ spirit, for a repetition of _her_ martyrdom.\r\n\r\nBut no\xe2\x80\x94it was not to be. His wife was the next person whom he\r\naddressed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x94who,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stammering with rage, \xe2\x80\x9cwho asked\r\nthis impudent fanatic into the house? Did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Aunt Ablewhite could say a word, Rachel answered for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack is here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cas my guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words had a singular effect on Mr. Ablewhite. They suddenly\r\nchanged him from a man in a state of red-hot anger to a man in a state\r\nof icy-cold contempt. It was plain to everybody that Rachel had said\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94short and plain as her answer had been\xe2\x80\x94which gave him the\r\nupper hand of her at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Clack is here as _your_ guest\xe2\x80\x94in _my_ house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s turn to lose her temper at that. Her colour rose, and\r\nher eyes brightened fiercely. She turned to the lawyer, and, pointing\r\nto Mr. Ablewhite, asked haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff interfered for the third time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to forget,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Mr. Ablewhite, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\ntook this house as Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s guardian, for Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so fast,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr. Ablewhite. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a last word to\r\nsay, which I should have said some time since, if this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He looked my\r\nway, pondering what abominable name he should call me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif this Rampant\r\nSpinster had not interrupted us. I beg to inform you, sir, that, if my\r\nson is not good enough to be Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s husband, I cannot presume\r\nto consider his father good enough to be Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s guardian.\r\nUnderstand, if you please, that I refuse to accept the position which\r\nis offered to me by Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s will. In your legal phrase, I\r\ndecline to act. This house has necessarily been hired in my name. I\r\ntake the entire responsibility of it on my shoulders. It is my house. I\r\ncan keep it, or let it, just as I please. I have no wish to hurry Miss\r\nVerinder. On the contrary, I beg her to remove her guest and her\r\nluggage, at her own entire convenience.\xe2\x80\x9d He made a low bow, and walked\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\nThat was Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s revenge on Rachel, for refusing to marry his\r\nson!\r\n\r\nThe instant the door closed, Aunt Ablewhite exhibited a phenomenon\r\nwhich silenced us all. She became endowed with energy enough to cross\r\nthe room!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking Rachel by the hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI should be ashamed of\r\nmy husband, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that it is his temper which has spoken to\r\nyou, and not himself. You,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Aunt Ablewhite, turning on me in\r\nmy corner with another endowment of energy, in her looks this time\r\ninstead of her limbs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou are the mischievous person who irritated him.\r\nI hope I shall never see you or your tracts again.\xe2\x80\x9d She went back to\r\nRachel and kissed her. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cin my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s name. What can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConsistently perverse in everything\xe2\x80\x94capricious and unreasonable in all\r\nthe actions of her life\xe2\x80\x94Rachel melted into tears at those commonplace\r\nwords, and returned her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s kiss in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I may be permitted to answer for Miss Verinder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmight I ask you, Mrs. Ablewhite, to send Penelope down with her\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet and shawl. Leave us ten minutes together,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nin a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand you may rely on my setting matters right, to your\r\nsatisfaction as well as to Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trust of the family in this man was something wonderful to see.\r\nWithout a word more, on her side, Aunt Ablewhite left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff, looking after her. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Herncastle blood has its\r\ndrawbacks, I admit. But there _is_ something in good breeding after\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving made that purely worldly remark, he looked hard at my corner, as\r\nif he expected me to go. My interest in Rachel\xe2\x80\x94an infinitely higher\r\ninterest than his\xe2\x80\x94riveted me to my chair.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff gave it up, exactly as he had given it up at Aunt Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nin Montagu Square. He led Rachel to a chair by the window, and spoke to\r\nher there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s conduct has naturally\r\nshocked you, and taken you by surprise. If it was worth while to\r\ncontest the question with such a man, we might soon show him that he is\r\nnot to have things all his own way. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth while. You were\r\nquite right in what you said just now; he is beneath our notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked round at my corner. I sat there quite immovable,\r\nwith my tracts at my elbow and with Miss Jane Ann Stamper on my lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, turning back again to Rachel, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it was part\r\nof your poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s fine nature always to see the best of the people\r\nabout her, and never the worst. She named her brother-in-law your\r\nguardian because she believed in him, and because she thought it would\r\nplease her sister. I had never liked Mr. Ablewhite myself, and I\r\ninduced your mother to let me insert a clause in the will, empowering\r\nher executors, in certain events, to consult with me about the\r\nappointment of a new guardian. One of those events has happened today;\r\nand I find myself in a position to end all these dry business details,\r\nI hope agreeably, with a message from my wife. Will you honour Mrs.\r\nBruff by becoming her guest? And will you remain under my roof, and be\r\none of my family, until we wise people have laid our heads together,\r\nand have settled what is to be done next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words, I rose to interfere. Mr. Bruff had done exactly what I\r\nhad dreaded he would do, when he asked Mrs. Ablewhite for Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\nBefore I could interpose a word, Rachel had accepted his invitation in\r\nthe warmest terms. If I suffered the arrangement thus made between them\r\nto be carried out\xe2\x80\x94if she once passed the threshold of Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94farewell to the fondest hope of my life, the hope of bringing my\r\nlost sheep back to the fold! The bare idea of such a calamity as this\r\nquite overwhelmed me. I cast the miserable trammels of worldly\r\ndiscretion to the winds, and spoke with the fervour that filled me, in\r\nthe words that came first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d I said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstop! I must be heard. Mr. Bruff! you are not related\r\nto her, and I am. I invite her\xe2\x80\x94I summon the executors to appoint _me_\r\nguardian. Rachel, dearest Rachel, I offer you my modest home; come to\r\nLondon by the next train, love, and share it with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff said nothing. Rachel looked at me with a cruel astonishment\r\nwhich she made no effort to conceal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, Drusilla,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall hope to visit you\r\nwhenever I happen to be in London. But I have accepted Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitation, and I think it will be best, for the present, if I remain\r\nunder Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t part with you, Rachel\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npart with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to fold her in my arms. But she drew back. My fervour did not\r\ncommunicate itself; it only alarmed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a very unnecessary display of agitation? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\nTheir hardness\xe2\x80\x94their hideous, worldly hardness\xe2\x80\x94revolted me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rachel! Rachel!\xe2\x80\x9d I burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen _yet_, that my\r\nheart yearns to make a Christian of you? Has no inner voice told you\r\nthat I am trying to do for _you_, what I was trying to do for your dear\r\nmother when death snatched her out of my hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRachel advanced a step nearer, and looked at me very strangely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your reference to my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nClack, will you have the goodness to explain yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer, Mr. Bruff came forward, and offering his arm to\r\nRachel, tried to lead her out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not pursue the subject, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Miss\r\nClack had better not explain herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf I had been a stock or a stone, such an interference as this must\r\nhave roused me into testifying to the truth. I put Mr. Bruff aside\r\nindignantly with my own hand, and, in solemn and suitable language, I\r\nstated the view with which sound doctrine does not scruple to regard\r\nthe awful calamity of dying unprepared.\r\n\r\nRachel started back from me\xe2\x80\x94I blush to write\xe2\x80\x94with a scream of horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cCome away, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, before\r\nthat woman can say any more! Oh, think of my poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s harmless,\r\nuseful, beautiful life! You were at the funeral, Mr. Bruff; you saw how\r\neverybody loved her; you saw the poor helpless people crying at her\r\ngrave over the loss of their best friend. And that wretch stands there,\r\nand tries to make me doubt that my mother, who was an angel on earth,\r\nis an angel in heaven now! Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to talk about it! Come away! It\r\nstifles me to breathe the same air with her! It frightens me to feel\r\nthat we are in the same room together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeaf to all remonstrance, she ran to the door.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, her maid entered with her bonnet and shawl. She\r\nhuddled them on anyhow. \xe2\x80\x9cPack my things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand bring them to\r\nMr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d I attempted to approach her\xe2\x80\x94I was shocked and grieved,\r\nbut, it is needless to say, not offended. I only wished to say to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay your hard heart be softened! I freely forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled\r\ndown her veil, and tore her shawl away from my hand, and, hurrying out,\r\nshut the door in my face. I bore the insult with my customary\r\nfortitude. I remember it now with my customary superiority to all\r\nfeeling of offence.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff had his parting word of mockery for me, before he too hurried\r\nout, in his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better not have explained yourself, Miss Clack,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and\r\nbowed, and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe person with the cap-ribbons followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see who has set them all by the ears together,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a poor servant\xe2\x80\x94but I declare I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of you!\xe2\x80\x9d She too\r\nwent out, and banged the door after her.\r\n\r\nI was left alone in the room. Reviled by them all, deserted by them\r\nall, I was left alone in the room.\r\n\r\nIs there more to be added to this plain statement of facts\xe2\x80\x94to this\r\ntouching picture of a Christian persecuted by the world? No! my diary\r\nreminds me that one more of the many chequered chapters in my life ends\r\nhere. From that day forth, I never saw Rachel Verinder again. She had\r\nmy forgiveness at the time when she insulted me. She has had my\r\nprayerful good wishes ever since. And when I die\xe2\x80\x94to complete the return\r\non my part of good for evil\xe2\x80\x94she will have the _Life, Letters, and\r\nLabours of Miss Jane Ann Stamper_ left her as a legacy by my will.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Mathew Bruff, Solicitor, of Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Square._\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMy fair friend, Miss Clack, having laid down the pen, there are two\r\nreasons for my taking it up next, in my turn.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I am in a position to throw the necessary light on\r\ncertain points of interest which have thus far been left in the dark.\r\nMiss Verinder had her own private reason for breaking her marriage\r\nengagement\xe2\x80\x94and I was at the bottom of it. Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite had his\r\nown private reason for withdrawing all claim to the hand of his\r\ncharming cousin\xe2\x80\x94and I discovered what it was.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it was my good or ill fortune, I hardly know\r\nwhich, to find myself personally involved\xe2\x80\x94at the period of which I am\r\nnow writing\xe2\x80\x94in the mystery of the Indian Diamond. I had the honour of\r\nan interview, at my own office, with an Oriental stranger of\r\ndistinguished manners, who was no other, unquestionably, than the chief\r\nof the three Indians. Add to this, that I met with the celebrated\r\ntraveller, Mr. Murthwaite, the day afterwards, and that I held a\r\nconversation with him on the subject of the Moonstone, which has a very\r\nimportant bearing on later events. And there you have the statement of\r\nmy claims to fill the position which I occupy in these pages.\r\n\r\nThe true story of the broken marriage engagement comes first in point\r\nof time, and must therefore take the first place in the present\r\nnarrative. Tracing my way back along the chain of events, from one end\r\nto the other, I find it necessary to open the scene, oddly enough as\r\nyou will think, at the bedside of my excellent client and friend, the\r\nlate Sir John Verinder.\r\n\r\nSir John had his share\xe2\x80\x94perhaps rather a large share\xe2\x80\x94of the more\r\nharmless and amiable of the weaknesses incidental to humanity. Among\r\nthese, I may mention as applicable to the matter in hand, an invincible\r\nreluctance\xe2\x80\x94so long as he enjoyed his usual good health\xe2\x80\x94to face the\r\nresponsibility of making his will. Lady Verinder exerted her influence\r\nto rouse him to a sense of duty in this matter; and I exerted my\r\ninfluence. He admitted the justice of our views\xe2\x80\x94but he went no further\r\nthan that, until he found himself afflicted with the illness which\r\nultimately brought him to his grave. Then, I was sent for at last, to\r\ntake my client\xe2\x80\x99s instructions on the subject of his will. They proved\r\nto be the simplest instructions I had ever received in the whole of my\r\nprofessional career.\r\n\r\nSir John was dozing, when I entered the room. He roused himself at the\r\nsight of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Mr. Bruff?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be very long about\r\nthis. And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to sleep again.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked on with great\r\ninterest while I collected pens, ink, and paper. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. I bowed and took a dip of ink, and waited for my instructions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave everything to my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir John. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nround on his pillow, and composed himself to sleep again.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to disturb him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you leave the whole of the\r\nproperty, of every sort and description, of which you die possessed,\r\nabsolutely to Lady Verinder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir John. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, _I_ put it shorter. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ put it\r\nshorter, and let me go to sleep again? Everything to my wife. That\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nWill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis property was entirely at his own disposal, and was of two kinds.\r\nProperty in land (I purposely abstain from using technical language),\r\nand property in money. In the majority of cases, I am afraid I should\r\nhave felt it my duty to my client to ask him to reconsider his Will. In\r\nthe case of Sir John, I knew Lady Verinder to be, not only worthy of\r\nthe unreserved trust which her husband had placed in her (all good\r\nwives are worthy of that)\xe2\x80\x94but to be also capable of properly\r\nadministering a trust (which, in my experience of the fair sex, not one\r\nin a thousand of them is competent to do). In ten minutes, Sir John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWill was drawn, and executed, and Sir John himself, good man, was\r\nfinishing his interrupted nap.\r\n\r\nLady Verinder amply justified the confidence which her husband had\r\nplaced in her. In the first days of her widowhood, she sent for me, and\r\nmade her Will. The view she took of her position was so thoroughly\r\nsound and sensible, that I was relieved of all necessity for advising\r\nher. My responsibility began and ended with shaping her instructions\r\ninto the proper legal form. Before Sir John had been a fortnight in his\r\ngrave, the future of his daughter had been most wisely and most\r\naffectionately provided for.\r\n\r\nThe Will remained in its fireproof box at my office, through more years\r\nthan I like to reckon up. It was not till the summer of eighteen\r\nhundred and forty-eight that I found occasion to look at it again under\r\nvery melancholy circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt the date I have mentioned, the doctors pronounced the sentence on\r\npoor Lady Verinder, which was literally a sentence of death. I was the\r\nfirst person whom she informed of her situation; and I found her\r\nanxious to go over her Will again with me.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to improve the provisions relating to her daughter.\r\nBut, in the lapse of time, her wishes in regard to certain minor\r\nlegacies, left to different relatives, had undergone some modification;\r\nand it became necessary to add three or four Codicils to the original\r\ndocument. Having done this at once, for fear of accident, I obtained\r\nher ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s permission to embody her recent instructions in a second\r\nWill. My object was to avoid certain inevitable confusions and\r\nrepetitions which now disfigured the original document, and which, to\r\nown the truth, grated sadly on my professional sense of the fitness of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this second Will has been described by Miss Clack, who\r\nwas so obliging as to witness it. So far as regarded Rachel Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npecuniary interests, it was, word for word, the exact counterpart of\r\nthe first Will. The only changes introduced related to the appointment\r\nof a guardian, and to certain provisions concerning that appointment,\r\nwhich were made under my advice. On Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s death, the Will was\r\nplaced in the hands of my proctor to be \xe2\x80\x9cproved\xe2\x80\x9d (as the phrase is) in\r\nthe usual way.\r\n\r\nIn about three weeks from that time\xe2\x80\x94as well as I can remember\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\nwarning reached me of something unusual going on under the surface. I\r\nhappened to be looking in at my friend the proctor\xe2\x80\x99s office, and I\r\nobserved that he received me with an appearance of greater interest\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some news for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think I heard at\r\nDoctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons this morning? Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s Will has been asked for,\r\nand examined, already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was news indeed! There was absolutely nothing which could be\r\ncontested in the Will; and there was nobody I could think of who had\r\nthe slightest interest in examining it. (I shall perhaps do well if I\r\nexplain in this place, for the benefit of the few people who don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nit already, that the law allows all Wills to be examined at Doctors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCommons by anybody who applies, on the payment of a shilling fee.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear who asked for the Will?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the clerk had no hesitation in telling _me_. Mr. Smalley, of the\r\nfirm of Skipp and Smalley, asked for it. The Will has not been copied\r\nyet into the great Folio Registers. So there was no alternative but to\r\ndepart from the usual course, and to let him see the original document.\r\nHe looked it over carefully, and made a note in his pocket-book. Have\r\nyou any idea of what he wanted with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall find out,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I am a day\r\nolder.\xe2\x80\x9d With that I went back at once to my own office.\r\n\r\nIf any other firm of solicitors had been concerned in this\r\nunaccountable examination of my deceased client\xe2\x80\x99s Will, I might have\r\nfound some difficulty in making the necessary discovery. But I had a\r\nhold over Skipp and Smalley which made my course in this matter a\r\ncomparatively easy one. My common-law clerk (a most competent and\r\nexcellent man) was a brother of Mr. Smalley\xe2\x80\x99s; and, owing to this sort\r\nof indirect connection with me, Skipp and Smalley had, for some years\r\npast, picked up the crumbs that fell from my table, in the shape of\r\ncases brought to my office, which, for various reasons, I did not think\r\nit worth while to undertake. My professional patronage was, in this\r\nway, of some importance to the firm. I intended, if necessary, to\r\nremind them of that patronage, on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nThe moment I got back I spoke to my clerk; and, after telling him what\r\nhad happened, I sent him to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s office, \xe2\x80\x9cwith Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliments, and he would be glad to know why Messrs. Skipp and Smalley\r\nhad found it necessary to examine Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis message brought Mr. Smalley back to my office in company with his\r\nbrother. He acknowledged that he had acted under instructions received\r\nfrom a client. And then he put it to me, whether it would not be a\r\nbreach of professional confidence on his part to say more.\r\n\r\nWe had a smart discussion upon that. He was right, no doubt; and I was\r\nwrong. The truth is, I was angry and suspicious\xe2\x80\x94and I insisted on\r\nknowing more. Worse still, I declined to consider any additional\r\ninformation offered me, as a secret placed in my keeping: I claimed\r\nperfect freedom to use my own discretion. Worse even than that, I took\r\nan unwarrantable advantage of my position. \xe2\x80\x9cChoose, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Mr.\r\nSmalley, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the risk of losing your client\xe2\x80\x99s business and the\r\nrisk of losing Mine.\xe2\x80\x9d Quite indefensible, I admit\xe2\x80\x94an act of tyranny,\r\nand nothing less. Like other tyrants, I carried my point. Mr. Smalley\r\nchose his alternative, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe smiled resignedly, and gave up the name of his client:\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\r\n\r\nThat was enough for me\xe2\x80\x94I wanted to know no more.\r\n\r\nHaving reached this point in my narrative, it now becomes necessary to\r\nplace the reader of these lines\xe2\x80\x94so far as Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s Will is\r\nconcerned\xe2\x80\x94on a footing of perfect equality, in respect of information,\r\nwith myself.\r\n\r\nLet me state, then, in the fewest possible words, that Rachel Verinder\r\nhad nothing but a life-interest in the property. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s excellent\r\nsense, and my long experience, had combined to relieve her of all\r\nresponsibility, and to guard her from all danger of becoming the victim\r\nin the future of some needy and unscrupulous man. Neither she, nor her\r\nhusband (if she married), could raise sixpence, either on the property\r\nin land, or on the property in money. They would have the houses in\r\nLondon and in Yorkshire to live in, and they would have the handsome\r\nincome\xe2\x80\x94and that was all.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to think over what I had discovered, I was sorely perplexed\r\nwhat to do next.\r\n\r\nHardly a week had passed since I had heard (to my surprise and\r\ndistress) of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s proposed marriage. I had the sincerest\r\nadmiration and affection for her; and I had been inexpressibly grieved\r\nwhen I heard that she was about to throw herself away on Mr. Godfrey\r\nAblewhite. And now, here was the man\xe2\x80\x94whom I had always believed to be a\r\nsmooth-tongued impostor\xe2\x80\x94justifying the very worst that I had thought of\r\nhim, and plainly revealing the mercenary object of the marriage, on his\r\nside! And what of that?\xe2\x80\x94you may reply\xe2\x80\x94the thing is done every day.\r\nGranted, my dear sir. But would you think of it quite as lightly as you\r\ndo, if the thing was done (let us say) with your own sister?\r\n\r\nThe first consideration which now naturally occurred to me was this.\r\nWould Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite hold to his engagement, after what his\r\nlawyer had discovered for him?\r\n\r\nIt depended entirely on his pecuniary position, of which I knew\r\nnothing. If that position was not a desperate one, it would be well\r\nworth his while to marry Miss Verinder for her income alone. If, on the\r\nother hand, he stood in urgent need of realising a large sum by a given\r\ntime, then Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s Will would exactly meet the case, and would\r\npreserve her daughter from falling into a scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\nIn the latter event, there would be no need for me to distress Miss\r\nRachel, in the first days of her mourning for her mother, by an\r\nimmediate revelation of the truth. In the former event, if I remained\r\nsilent, I should be conniving at a marriage which would make her\r\nmiserable for life.\r\n\r\nMy doubts ended in my calling at the hotel in London, at which I knew\r\nMrs. Ablewhite and Miss Verinder to be staying. They informed me that\r\nthey were going to Brighton the next day, and that an unexpected\r\nobstacle prevented Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite from accompanying them. I at\r\nonce proposed to take his place. While I was only thinking of Rachel\r\nVerinder, it was possible to hesitate. When I actually saw her, my mind\r\nwas made up directly, come what might of it, to tell her the truth.\r\n\r\nI found my opportunity, when I was out walking with her, on the day\r\nafter my arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cabout your marriage engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, indifferently, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have nothing more interesting\r\nto talk about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you forgive an old friend and servant of your family, Miss\r\nRachel, if I venture on asking whether your heart is set on this\r\nmarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am marrying in despair, Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x94on the chance of dropping into\r\nsome sort of stagnant happiness which may reconcile me to my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrong language! and suggestive of something below the surface, in the\r\nshape of a romance. But I had my own object in view, and I declined (as\r\nwe lawyers say) to pursue the question into its side issues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Godfrey Ablewhite can hardly be of your way of thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_His_ heart must be set on the marriage at any rate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says so, and I suppose I ought to believe him. He would hardly\r\nmarry me, after what I have owned to him, unless he was fond of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor thing! the bare idea of a man marrying her for his own selfish and\r\nmercenary ends had never entered her head. The task I had set myself\r\nbegan to look like a harder task than I had bargained for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds strangely,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cin my old-fashioned ears\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sounds strangely?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hear you speak of your future husband as if you were not quite sure\r\nof the sincerity of his attachment. Are you conscious of any reason in\r\nyour own mind for doubting him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer astonishing quickness of perception, detected a change in my voice,\r\nor my manner, when I put that question, which warned her that I had\r\nbeen speaking all along with some ulterior object in view. She stopped,\r\nand taking her arm out of mine, looked me searchingly in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bruff,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have something to tell me about Godfrey\r\nAblewhite. Tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew her well enough to take her at her word. I told it.\r\n\r\nShe put her arm again into mine, and walked on with me slowly. I felt\r\nher hand tightening its grasp mechanically on my arm, and I saw her\r\ngetting paler and paler as I went on\xe2\x80\x94but, not a word passed her lips\r\nwhile I was speaking. When I had done, she still kept silence. Her head\r\ndrooped a little, and she walked by my side, unconscious of my\r\npresence, unconscious of everything about her; lost\xe2\x80\x94buried, I might\r\nalmost say\xe2\x80\x94in her own thoughts.\r\n\r\nI made no attempt to disturb her. My experience of her disposition\r\nwarned me, on this, as on former occasions, to give her time.\r\n\r\nThe first instinct of girls in general, on being told of anything which\r\ninterests them, is to ask a multitude of questions, and then to run\r\noff, and talk it all over with some favourite friend. Rachel Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst instinct, under similar circumstances, was to shut herself up in\r\nher own mind, and to think it over by herself. This absolute\r\nself-dependence is a great virtue in a man. In a woman it has a serious\r\ndrawback of morally separating her from the mass of her sex, and so\r\nexposing her to misconstruction by the general opinion. I strongly\r\nsuspect myself of thinking as the rest of the world think in this\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94except in the case of Rachel Verinder. The self-dependence in\r\n_her_ character, was one of its virtues in my estimation; partly, no\r\ndoubt, because I sincerely admired and liked her; partly, because the\r\nview I took of her connexion with the loss of the Moonstone was based\r\non my own special knowledge of her disposition. Badly as appearances\r\nmight look, in the matter of the Diamond\xe2\x80\x94shocking as it undoubtedly was\r\nto know that she was associated in any way with the mystery of an\r\nundiscovered theft\xe2\x80\x94I was satisfied nevertheless that she had done\r\nnothing unworthy of her, because I was also satisfied that she had not\r\nstirred a step in the business, without shutting herself up in her own\r\nmind, and thinking it over first.\r\n\r\nWe had walked on, for nearly a mile I should say, before Rachel roused\r\nherself. She suddenly looked up at me with a faint reflection of her\r\nsmile of happier times\xe2\x80\x94the most irresistible smile I have ever seen on\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe much already to your kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I feel more\r\ndeeply indebted to it now than ever. If you hear any rumours of my\r\nmarriage when you get back to London contradict them at once, on my\r\nauthority.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you resolved to break your engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned proudly, \xe2\x80\x9cafter what you have told\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Rachel, you are very young\xe2\x80\x94and you may find more\r\ndifficulty in withdrawing from your present position than you\r\nanticipate. Have you no one\xe2\x80\x94I mean a lady, of course\xe2\x80\x94whom you could\r\nconsult?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nIt distressed me, it did indeed distress me, to hear her say that. She\r\nwas so young and so lonely\xe2\x80\x94and she bore it so well! The impulse to help\r\nher got the better of any sense of my own unfitness which I might have\r\nfelt under the circumstances; and I stated such ideas on the subject as\r\noccurred to me on the spur of the moment, to the best of my ability. I\r\nhave advised a prodigious number of clients, and have dealt with some\r\nexceedingly awkward difficulties, in my time. But this was the first\r\noccasion on which I had ever found myself advising a young lady how to\r\nobtain her release from a marriage engagement. The suggestion I offered\r\namounted briefly to this. I recommended her to tell Mr. Godfrey\r\nAblewhite\xe2\x80\x94at a private interview, of course\xe2\x80\x94that he had, to her certain\r\nknowledge, betrayed the mercenary nature of the motive on his side. She\r\nwas then to add that their marriage, after what she had discovered, was\r\na simple impossibility\xe2\x80\x94and she was to put it to him, whether he thought\r\nit wisest to secure her silence by falling in with her views, or to\r\nforce her, by opposing them, to make the motive under which she was\r\nacting generally known. If he attempted to defend himself, or to deny\r\nthe facts, she was, in that event, to refer him to _me_.\r\n\r\nMiss Verinder listened attentively till I had done. She then thanked me\r\nvery prettily for my advice, but informed me at the same time that it\r\nwas impossible for her to follow it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat objection you see to following it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated\xe2\x80\x94and then met me with a question on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you were asked to express your opinion of Mr. Godfrey\r\nAblewhite\xe2\x80\x99s conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should call it the conduct of a meanly deceitful man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bruff! I have believed in that man. I have promised to marry that\r\nman. How can I tell him he is mean, how can I tell him he has deceived\r\nme, how can I disgrace him in the eyes of the world after that? I have\r\ndegraded myself by ever thinking of him as my husband. If I say what\r\nyou tell me to say to him\xe2\x80\x94I am owning that I have degraded myself to\r\nhis face. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. After what has passed between us, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthat! The shame of it would be nothing to _him_. But the shame of it\r\nwould be unendurable to _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was another of the marked peculiarities in her character\r\ndisclosing itself to me without reserve. Here was her sensitive horror\r\nof the bare contact with anything mean, blinding her to every\r\nconsideration of what she owed to herself, hurrying her into a false\r\nposition which might compromise her in the estimation of all her\r\nfriends! Up to this time, I had been a little diffident about the\r\npropriety of the advice I had given to her. But, after what she had\r\njust said, I had no sort of doubt that it was the best advice that\r\ncould have been offered; and I felt no sort of hesitation in pressing\r\nit on her again.\r\n\r\nShe only shook her head, and repeated her objection in other words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been intimate enough with me to ask me to be his wife. He has\r\nstood high enough in my estimation to obtain my consent. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nhim to his face that he is the most contemptible of living creatures,\r\nafter that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear Miss Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d I remonstrated, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s equally impossible\r\nfor you to tell him that you withdraw from your engagement without\r\ngiving some reason for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall say that I have thought it over, and that I am satisfied it\r\nwill be best for both of us if we part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you thought of what he may say, on his side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may say what he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to admire her delicacy and her resolution, and it\r\nwas equally impossible not to feel that she was putting herself in the\r\nwrong. I entreated her to consider her own position. I reminded her\r\nthat she would be exposing herself to the most odious misconstruction\r\nof her motives. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t brave public opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cat the\r\ncommand of private feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have forgotten the Moonstone, Mr. Bruff. Have I not braved public\r\nopinion, _there_, with my own private reasons for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer answer silenced me for the moment. It set me trying to trace the\r\nexplanation of her conduct, at the time of the loss of the Moonstone,\r\nout of the strange avowal which had just escaped her. I might perhaps\r\nhave done it when I was younger. I certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it now.\r\n\r\nI tried a last remonstrance before we returned to the house. She was\r\njust as immovable as ever. My mind was in a strange conflict of\r\nfeelings about her when I left her that day. She was obstinate; she was\r\nwrong. She was interesting; she was admirable; she was deeply to be\r\npitied. I made her promise to write to me the moment she had any news\r\nto send. And I went back to my business in London, with a mind\r\nexceedingly ill at ease.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of my return, before it was possible for me to receive\r\nmy promised letter, I was surprised by a visit from Mr. Ablewhite the\r\nelder, and was informed that Mr. Godfrey had got his dismissal\xe2\x80\x94_and had\r\naccepted it_\xe2\x80\x94that very day.\r\n\r\nWith the view I already took of the case, the bare fact stated in the\r\nwords that I have underlined, revealed Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s motive\r\nfor submission as plainly as if he had acknowledged it himself. He\r\nneeded a large sum of money; and he needed it by a given time. Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nincome, which would have helped him to anything else, would not help\r\nhim here; and Rachel had accordingly released herself, without\r\nencountering a moment\xe2\x80\x99s serious opposition on his part. If I am told\r\nthat this is a mere speculation, I ask, in my turn, what other theory\r\nwill account for his giving up a marriage which would have maintained\r\nhim in splendour for the rest of his life?\r\n\r\nAny exultation I might otherwise have felt at the lucky turn which\r\nthings had now taken, was effectually checked by what passed at my\r\ninterview with old Mr. Ablewhite.\r\n\r\nHe came, of course, to know whether I could give him any explanation of\r\nMiss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary conduct. It is needless to say that I was\r\nquite unable to afford him the information he wanted. The annoyance\r\nwhich I thus inflicted, following on the irritation produced by a\r\nrecent interview with his son, threw Mr. Ablewhite off his guard. Both\r\nhis looks and his language convinced me that Miss Verinder would find\r\nhim a merciless man to deal with, when he joined the ladies at Brighton\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nI had a restless night, considering what I ought to do next. How my\r\nreflections ended, and how thoroughly well founded my distrust of Mr.\r\nAblewhite proved to be, are items of information which (as I am told)\r\nhave already been put tidily in their proper places, by that exemplary\r\nperson, Miss Clack. I have only to add\xe2\x80\x94in completion of her\r\nnarrative\xe2\x80\x94that Miss Verinder found the quiet and repose which she sadly\r\nneeded, poor thing, in my house at Hampstead. She honoured us by making\r\na long stay. My wife and daughters were charmed with her; and, when the\r\nexecutors decided on the appointment of a new guardian, I feel sincere\r\npride and pleasure in recording that my guest and my family parted like\r\nold friends, on either side.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe next thing I have to do, is to present such additional information\r\nas I possess on the subject of the Moonstone, or, to speak more\r\ncorrectly, on the subject of the Indian plot to steal the Diamond. The\r\nlittle that I have to tell is (as I think I have already said) of some\r\nimportance, nevertheless, in respect of its bearing very remarkably on\r\nevents which are still to come.\r\n\r\nAbout a week or ten days after Miss Verinder had left us, one of my\r\nclerks entered the private room at my office, with a card in his hand,\r\nand informed me that a gentleman was below, who wanted to speak to me.\r\n\r\nI looked at the card. There was a foreign name written on it, which has\r\nescaped my memory. It was followed by a line written in English at the\r\nbottom of the card, which I remember perfectly well:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecommended by Mr. Septimus Luker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe audacity of a person in Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s position presuming to recommend\r\nanybody to _me_, took me so completely by surprise, that I sat silent\r\nfor the moment, wondering whether my own eyes had not deceived me. The\r\nclerk, observing my bewilderment, favoured me with the result of his\r\nown observation of the stranger who was waiting downstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s rather a remarkable-looking man, sir. So dark in the complexion\r\nthat we all set him down in the office for an Indian, or something of\r\nthat sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAssociating the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s idea with the line inscribed on the card in my\r\nhand, I thought it possible that the Moonstone might be at the bottom\r\nof Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, and of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s visit at my\r\noffice. To the astonishment of my clerk, I at once decided on granting\r\nan interview to the gentleman below.\r\n\r\nIn justification of the highly unprofessional sacrifice to mere\r\ncuriosity which I thus made, permit me to remind anybody who may read\r\nthese lines, that no living person (in England, at any rate) can claim\r\nto have had such an intimate connexion with the romance of the Indian\r\nDiamond as mine has been. I was trusted with the secret of Colonel\r\nHerncastle\xe2\x80\x99s plan for escaping assassination. I received the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters, periodically reporting himself a living man. I drew his Will,\r\nleaving the Moonstone to Miss Verinder. I persuaded his executor to\r\nact, on the chance that the jewel might prove to be a valuable\r\nacquisition to the family. And, lastly, I combated Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscruples, and induced him to be the means of transporting the Diamond\r\nto Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house. If anyone can claim a prescriptive right of\r\ninterest in the Moonstone, and in everything connected with it, I think\r\nit is hardly to be denied that I am the man.\r\n\r\nThe moment my mysterious client was shown in, I felt an inner\r\nconviction that I was in the presence of one of the three\r\nIndians\xe2\x80\x94probably of the chief. He was carefully dressed in European\r\ncostume. But his swarthy complexion, his long lithe figure, and his\r\ngrave and graceful politeness of manner were enough to betray his\r\nOriental origin to any intelligent eyes that looked at him.\r\n\r\nI pointed to a chair, and begged to be informed of the nature of his\r\nbusiness with me.\r\n\r\nAfter first apologising\xe2\x80\x94in an excellent selection of English words\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthe liberty which he had taken in disturbing me, the Indian produced a\r\nsmall parcel the outer covering of which was of cloth of gold. Removing\r\nthis and a second wrapping of some silken fabric, he placed a little\r\nbox, or casket, on my table, most beautifully and richly inlaid in\r\njewels, on an ebony ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto ask you to lend me some money. And I\r\nleave this as an assurance to you that my debt will be paid back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pointed to his card. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you apply to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cat Mr.\r\nLuker\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask how it is that Mr. Luker himself did not advance the money\r\nthat you require?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Luker informed me, sir, that he had no money to lend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so he recommended you to come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian, in his turn, pointed to the card. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is written there,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBriefly answered, and thoroughly to the purpose! If the Moonstone had\r\nbeen in my possession, this Oriental gentleman would have murdered me,\r\nI am well aware, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. At the same time, and\r\nbarring that slight drawback, I am bound to testify that he was the\r\nperfect model of a client. He might not have respected my life. But he\r\ndid what none of my own countrymen had ever done, in all my experience\r\nof them\xe2\x80\x94he respected my time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should have had the trouble of coming\r\nto me. Mr. Luker is quite mistaken in sending you here. I am trusted,\r\nlike other men in my profession, with money to lend. But I never lend\r\nit to strangers, and I never lend it on such a security as you have\r\nproduced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFar from attempting, as other people would have done, to induce me to\r\nrelax my own rules, the Indian only made me another bow, and wrapped up\r\nhis box in its two coverings without a word of protest. He rose\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nadmirable assassin rose to go, the moment I had answered him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your condescension towards a stranger, excuse my asking one\r\nquestion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I take my leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed on my side. Only one question at parting! The average in my\r\nexperience was fifty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing, sir, it had been possible (and customary) for _you_ to lend\r\nme the money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin what space of time would it have been\r\npossible (and customary) for _me_ to pay it back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the usual course pursued in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou would have been entitled to pay the money back (if you liked) in\r\none year\xe2\x80\x99s time from the date at which it was first advanced to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Indian made me a last bow, the lowest of all\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly and\r\nsoftly walked out of the room.\r\n\r\nIt was done in a moment, in a noiseless, supple, cat-like way, which a\r\nlittle startled me, I own. As soon as I was composed enough to think, I\r\narrived at one distinct conclusion in reference to the otherwise\r\nincomprehensible visitor who had favoured me with a call.\r\n\r\nHis face, voice, and manner\xe2\x80\x94while I was in his company\xe2\x80\x94were under such\r\nperfect control that they set all scrutiny at defiance. But he had\r\ngiven me one chance of looking under the smooth outer surface of him,\r\nfor all that. He had not shown the slightest sign of attempting to fix\r\nanything that I had said to him in his mind, until I mentioned the time\r\nat which it was customary to permit the earliest repayment, on the part\r\nof a debtor, of money that had been advanced as a loan. When I gave him\r\nthat piece of information, he looked me straight in the face, while I\r\nwas speaking, for the first time. The inference I drew from this\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94that he had a special purpose in asking me his last question, and a\r\nspecial interest in hearing my answer to it. The more carefully I\r\nreflected on what had passed between us, the more shrewdly I suspected\r\nthe production of the casket, and the application for the loan, of\r\nhaving been mere formalities, designed to pave the way for the parting\r\ninquiry addressed to me.\r\n\r\nI had satisfied myself of the correctness of this conclusion\xe2\x80\x94and was\r\ntrying to get on a step further, and penetrate the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s motives\r\nnext\xe2\x80\x94when a letter was brought to me, which proved to be from no less a\r\nperson that Mr. Septimus Luker himself. He asked my pardon in terms of\r\nsickening servility, and assured me that he could explain matters to my\r\nsatisfaction, if I would honour him by consenting to a personal\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nI made another unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity. I honoured\r\nhim by making an appointment at my office, for the next day.\r\n\r\nMr. Luker was, in every respect, such an inferior creature to the\r\nIndian\xe2\x80\x94he was so vulgar, so ugly, so cringing, and so prosy\xe2\x80\x94that he is\r\nquite unworthy of being reported, at any length, in these pages. The\r\nsubstance of what he had to tell me may be fairly stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThe day before I had received the visit of the Indian, Mr. Luker had\r\nbeen favoured with a call from that accomplished gentleman. In spite of\r\nhis European disguise, Mr. Luker had instantly identified his visitor\r\nwith the chief of the three Indians, who had formerly annoyed him by\r\nloitering about his house, and who had left him no alternative but to\r\nconsult a magistrate. From this startling discovery he had rushed to\r\nthe conclusion (naturally enough I own) that he must certainly be in\r\nthe company of one of the three men, who had blindfolded him, gagged\r\nhim, and robbed him of his banker\xe2\x80\x99s receipt. The result was that he\r\nbecame quite paralysed with terror, and that he firmly believed his\r\nlast hour had come.\r\n\r\nOn his side, the Indian preserved the character of a perfect stranger.\r\nHe produced the little casket, and made exactly the same application\r\nwhich he had afterwards made to me. As the speediest way of getting rid\r\nof him, Mr. Luker had at once declared that he had no money. The Indian\r\nhad thereupon asked to be informed of the best and safest person to\r\napply to for the loan he wanted. Mr. Luker had answered that the best\r\nand safest person, in such cases, was usually a respectable solicitor.\r\nAsked to name some individual of that character and profession, Mr.\r\nLuker had mentioned me\xe2\x80\x94for the one simple reason that, in the extremity\r\nof his terror, mine was the first name which occurred to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nperspiration was pouring off me like rain, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the wretched creature\r\nconcluded. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was talking about. And I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlook over it, Mr. Bruff, sir, in consideration of my having been really\r\nand truly frightened out of my wits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI excused the fellow graciously enough. It was the readiest way of\r\nreleasing myself from the sight of him. Before he left me, I detained\r\nhim to make one inquiry.\r\n\r\nHad the Indian said anything noticeable, at the moment of quitting Mr.\r\nLuker\xe2\x80\x99s house?\r\n\r\nYes! The Indian had put precisely the same question to Mr. Luker, at\r\nparting, which he had put to me; receiving of course, the same answer\r\nas the answer which I had given him.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean? Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s explanation gave me no assistance towards\r\nsolving the problem. My own unaided ingenuity, consulted next, proved\r\nquite unequal to grapple with the difficulty. I had a dinner engagement\r\nthat evening; and I went upstairs, in no very genial frame of mind,\r\nlittle suspecting that the way to my dressing-room and the way to\r\ndiscovery, meant, on this particular occasion, one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe prominent personage among the guests at the dinner party I found to\r\nbe Mr. Murthwaite.\r\n\r\nOn his appearance in England, after his wanderings, society had been\r\ngreatly interested in the traveller, as a man who had passed through\r\nmany dangerous adventures, and who had escaped to tell the tale. He had\r\nnow announced his intention of returning to the scene of his exploits,\r\nand of penetrating into regions left still unexplored. This magnificent\r\nindifference to placing his safety in peril for the second time,\r\nrevived the flagging interest of the worshippers in the hero. The law\r\nof chances was clearly against his escaping on this occasion. It is not\r\nevery day that we can meet an eminent person at dinner, and feel that\r\nthere is a reasonable prospect of the news of his murder being the news\r\nthat we hear of him next.\r\n\r\nWhen the gentlemen were left by themselves in the dining-room, I found\r\nmyself sitting next to Mr. Murthwaite. The guests present being all\r\nEnglish, it is needless to say that, as soon as the wholesome check\r\nexercised by the presence of the ladies was removed, the conversation\r\nturned on politics as a necessary result.\r\n\r\nIn respect to this all-absorbing national topic, I happen to be one of\r\nthe most un-English Englishmen living. As a general rule, political\r\ntalk appears to me to be of all talk the most dreary and the most\r\nprofitless. Glancing at Mr. Murthwaite, when the bottles had made their\r\nfirst round of the table, I found that he was apparently of my way of\r\nthinking. He was doing it very dexterously\xe2\x80\x94with all possible\r\nconsideration for the feelings of his host\xe2\x80\x94but it is not the less\r\ncertain that he was composing himself for a nap. It struck me as an\r\nexperiment worth attempting, to try whether a judicious allusion to the\r\nsubject of the Moonstone would keep him awake, and, if it did, to see\r\nwhat _he_ thought of the last new complication in the Indian\r\nconspiracy, as revealed in the prosaic precincts of my office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not mistaken, Mr. Murthwaite,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were acquainted\r\nwith the late Lady Verinder, and you took some interest in the strange\r\nsuccession of events which ended in the loss of the Moonstone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eminent traveller did me the honour of waking up in an instant, and\r\nasking me who I was.\r\n\r\nI informed him of my professional connection with the Herncastle\r\nfamily, not forgetting the curious position which I had occupied\r\ntowards the Colonel and his Diamond in the bygone time.\r\n\r\nMr. Murthwaite shifted round in his chair, so as to put the rest of the\r\ncompany behind him (Conservatives and Liberals alike), and concentrated\r\nhis whole attention on plain Mr. Bruff, of Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Square.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard anything, lately, of the Indians?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have every reason to believe,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat one of them had an\r\ninterview with me, in my office, yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Murthwaite was not an easy man to astonish; but that last answer of\r\nmine completely staggered him. I described what had happened to Mr.\r\nLuker, and what had happened to myself, exactly as I have described it\r\nhere. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear that the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s parting inquiry had an object,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he be so anxious to know the time at which a\r\nborrower of money is usually privileged to pay the money back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that you don\xe2\x80\x99t see his motive, Mr. Bruff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed of my stupidity, Mr. Murthwaite\xe2\x80\x94but I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great traveller became quite interested in sounding the immense\r\nvacuity of my dulness to its lowest depths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you one question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn what position does the\r\nconspiracy to seize the Moonstone now stand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian plot is a mystery to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian plot, Mr. Bruff, can only be a mystery to you, because you\r\nhave never seriously examined it. Shall we run it over together, from\r\nthe time when you drew Colonel Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s Will, to the time when the\r\nIndian called at your office? In your position, it may be of very\r\nserious importance to the interests of Miss Verinder, that you should\r\nbe able to take a clear view of this matter in case of need. Tell me,\r\nbearing that in mind, whether you will penetrate the Indian\xe2\x80\x99s motive\r\nfor yourself? or whether you wish me to save you the trouble of making\r\nany inquiry into it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that I thoroughly appreciated the practical\r\npurpose which I now saw that he had in view, and that the first of the\r\ntwo alternatives was the alternative I chose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Murthwaite. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will take the question of the\r\nages of the three Indians first. I can testify that they all look much\r\nabout the same age\xe2\x80\x94and you can decide for yourself, whether the man\r\nwhom you saw was, or was not, in the prime of life. Not forty, you\r\nthink? My idea too. We will say not forty. Now look back to the time\r\nwhen Colonel Herncastle came to England, and when you were concerned in\r\nthe plan he adopted to preserve his life. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to count the\r\nyears. I will only say, it is clear that these present Indians, at\r\ntheir age, must be the successors of three other Indians (high caste\r\nBrahmins all of them, Mr. Bruff, when they left their native country!)\r\nwho followed the Colonel to these shores. Very well. These present men\r\nof ours have succeeded to the men who were here before them. If they\r\nhad only done that, the matter would not have been worth inquiring\r\ninto. But they have done more. They have succeeded to the organisation\r\nwhich their predecessors established in this country. Don\xe2\x80\x99t start! The\r\norganisation is a very trumpery affair, according to our ideas, I have\r\nno doubt. I should reckon it up as including the command of money; the\r\nservices, when needed, of that shady sort of Englishman, who lives in\r\nthe byways of foreign life in London; and, lastly, the secret sympathy\r\nof such few men of their own country, and (formerly, at least) of their\r\nown religion, as happen to be employed in ministering to some of the\r\nmultitudinous wants of this great city. Nothing very formidable, as you\r\nsee! But worth notice at starting, because we _may_ find occasion to\r\nrefer to this modest little Indian organisation as we go on. Having now\r\ncleared the ground, I am going to ask you a question; and I expect your\r\nexperience to answer it. What was the event which gave the Indians\r\ntheir first chance of seizing the Diamond?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood the allusion to my experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first chance they got,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwas clearly offered to them by\r\nColonel Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s death. They would be aware of his death, I\r\nsuppose, as a matter of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of course. And his death, as you say, gave them their\r\nfirst chance. Up to that time the Moonstone was safe in the strongroom\r\nof the bank. You drew the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s Will leaving his jewel to his\r\nniece; and the Will was proved in the usual way. As a lawyer, you can\r\nbe at no loss to know what course the Indians would take (under English\r\nadvice) after _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would provide themselves with a copy of the Will from Doctors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCommons,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. One or other of those shady Englishmen to whom I have\r\nalluded, would get them the copy you have described. That copy would\r\ninform them that the Moonstone was bequeathed to the daughter of Lady\r\nVerinder, and that Mr. Blake the elder, or some person appointed by\r\nhim, was to place it in her hands. You will agree with me that the\r\nnecessary information about persons in the position of Lady Verinder\r\nand Mr. Blake, would be perfectly easy information to obtain. The one\r\ndifficulty for the Indians would be to decide whether they should make\r\ntheir attempt on the Diamond when it was in course of removal from the\r\nkeeping of the bank, or whether they should wait until it was taken\r\ndown to Yorkshire to Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house. The second way would be\r\nmanifestly the safest way\xe2\x80\x94and there you have the explanation of the\r\nappearance of the Indians at Frizinghall, disguised as jugglers, and\r\nwaiting their time. In London, it is needless to say, they had their\r\norganisation at their disposal to keep them informed of events. Two men\r\nwould do it. One to follow anybody who went from Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s house to\r\nthe bank. And one to treat the lower men servants with beer, and to\r\nhear the news of the house. These commonplace precautions would readily\r\ninform them that Mr. Franklin Blake had been to the bank, and that Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake was the only person in the house who was going to visit\r\nLady Verinder. What actually followed upon that discovery, you\r\nremember, no doubt, quite as correctly as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remembered that Franklin Blake had detected one of the spies, in the\r\nstreet\xe2\x80\x94that he had, in consequence, advanced the time of his arrival in\r\nYorkshire by some hours\xe2\x80\x94and that (thanks to old Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s excellent\r\nadvice) he had lodged the Diamond in the bank at Frizinghall, before\r\nthe Indians were so much as prepared to see him in the neighbourhood.\r\nAll perfectly clear so far. But the Indians being ignorant of the\r\nprecautions thus taken, how was it that they had made no attempt on\r\nLady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house (in which they must have supposed the Diamond to\r\nbe) through the whole of the interval that elapsed before Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbirthday?\r\n\r\nIn putting this difficulty to Mr. Murthwaite, I thought it right to add\r\nthat I had heard of the little boy, and the drop of ink, and the rest\r\nof it, and that any explanation based on the theory of clairvoyance was\r\nan explanation which would carry no conviction whatever with it, to\r\n_my_ mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor to mine either,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Murthwaite. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clairvoyance in this\r\ncase is simply a development of the romantic side of the Indian\r\ncharacter. It would be refreshment and an encouragement to those\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x94quite inconceivable, I grant you, to the English mind\xe2\x80\x94to surround\r\ntheir wearisome and perilous errand in this country with a certain halo\r\nof the marvellous and the supernatural. Their boy is unquestionably a\r\nsensitive subject to the mesmeric influence\xe2\x80\x94and, under that influence,\r\nhe has no doubt reflected what was already in the mind of the person\r\nmesmerising him. I have tested the theory of clairvoyance\xe2\x80\x94and I have\r\nnever found the manifestations get beyond that point. The Indians don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ninvestigate the matter in this way; the Indians look upon their boy as\r\na Seer of things invisible to their eyes\xe2\x80\x94and, I repeat, in that marvel\r\nthey find the source of a new interest in the purpose that unites them.\r\nI only notice this as offering a curious view of human character, which\r\nmust be quite new to you. We have nothing whatever to do with\r\nclairvoyance, or with mesmerism, or with anything else that is hard of\r\nbelief to a practical man, in the inquiry that we are now pursuing. My\r\nobject in following the Indian plot, step by step, is to trace results\r\nback, by rational means, to natural causes. Have I succeeded to your\r\nsatisfaction so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it, Mr. Murthwaite! I am waiting, however, with some\r\nanxiety, to hear the rational explanation of the difficulty which I\r\nhave just had the honour of submitting to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Murthwaite smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest difficulty to deal with of\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to begin by admitting your statement of the\r\ncase as a perfectly correct one. The Indians were undoubtedly not aware\r\nof what Mr. Franklin Blake had done with the Diamond\xe2\x80\x94for we find them\r\nmaking their first mistake, on the first night of Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s arrival\r\nat his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir first mistake?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! The mistake of allowing themselves to be surprised, lurking\r\nabout the terrace at night, by Gabriel Betteredge. However, they had\r\nthe merit of seeing for themselves that they had taken a false\r\nstep\xe2\x80\x94for, as you say, again, with plenty of time at their disposal,\r\nthey never came near the house for weeks afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Murthwaite? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know! Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause no Indian, Mr. Bruff, ever runs an unnecessary risk. The\r\nclause you drew in Colonel Herncastle\xe2\x80\x99s Will, informed them (didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?) that the Moonstone was to pass absolutely into Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossession on her birthday. Very well. Tell me which was the safest\r\ncourse for men in their position? To make their attempt on the Diamond\r\nwhile it was under the control of Mr. Franklin Blake, who had shown\r\nalready that he could suspect and outwit them? Or to wait till the\r\nDiamond was at the disposal of a young girl, who would innocently\r\ndelight in wearing the magnificent jewel at every possible opportunity?\r\nPerhaps you want a proof that my theory is correct? Take the conduct of\r\nthe Indians themselves as the proof. They appeared at the house, after\r\nwaiting all those weeks, on Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s birthday; and they were\r\nrewarded for the patient accuracy of their calculations by seeing the\r\nMoonstone in the bosom of her dress! When I heard the story of the\r\nColonel and the Diamond, later in the evening, I felt so sure about the\r\nrisk Mr. Franklin Blake had run (they would have certainly attacked\r\nhim, if he had not happened to ride back to Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\ncompany of other people); and I was so strongly convinced of the worse\r\nrisk still, in store for Miss Verinder, that I recommended following\r\nthe Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and destroying the identity of the gem by having it\r\ncut into separate stones. How its extraordinary disappearance that\r\nnight, made my advice useless, and utterly defeated the Hindoo plot\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhow all further action on the part of the Indians was paralysed the\r\nnext day by their confinement in prison as rogues and vagabonds\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow as well as I do. The first act in the conspiracy closes there.\r\nBefore we go on to the second, may I ask whether I have met your\r\ndifficulty, with an explanation which is satisfactory to the mind of a\r\npractical man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to deny that he had met my difficulty fairly; thanks\r\nto his superior knowledge of the Indian character\xe2\x80\x94and thanks to his not\r\nhaving had hundreds of other Wills to think of since Colonel\r\nHerncastle\xe2\x80\x99s time!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far, so good,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr. Murthwaite. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first chance the\r\nIndians had of seizing the Diamond was a chance lost, on the day when\r\nthey were committed to the prison at Frizinghall. When did the second\r\nchance offer itself? The second chance offered itself\xe2\x80\x94as I am in a\r\ncondition to prove\xe2\x80\x94while they were still in confinement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out his pocket-book, and opened it at a particular leaf, before\r\nhe went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was staying,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cwith some friends at Frizinghall, at the\r\ntime. A day or two before the Indians were set free (on a Monday, I\r\nthink), the governor of the prison came to me with a letter. It had\r\nbeen left for the Indians by one Mrs. Macann, of whom they had hired\r\nthe lodging in which they lived; and it had been delivered at Mrs.\r\nMacann\xe2\x80\x99s door, in ordinary course of post, on the previous morning. The\r\nprison authorities had noticed that the postmark was \xe2\x80\x98Lambeth,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthat the address on the outside, though expressed in correct English,\r\nwas, in form, oddly at variance with the customary method of directing\r\na letter. On opening it, they had found the contents to be written in a\r\nforeign language, which they rightly guessed at as Hindustani. Their\r\nobject in coming to me was, of course, to have the letter translated to\r\nthem. I took a copy in my pocket-book of the original, and of my\r\ntranslation\xe2\x80\x94and there they are at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed me the open pocket-book. The address on the letter was the\r\nfirst thing copied. It was all written in one paragraph, without any\r\nattempt at punctuation, thus: \xe2\x80\x9cTo the three Indian men living with the\r\nlady called Macann at Frizinghall in Yorkshire.\xe2\x80\x9d The Hindoo characters\r\nfollowed; and the English translation appeared at the end, expressed in\r\nthese mysterious words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of the Regent of the Night, whose seat is on the Antelope,\r\nwhose arms embrace the four corners of the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrothers, turn your faces to the south, and come to me in the street\r\nof many noises, which leads down to the muddy river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason is this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own eyes have seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere the letter ended, without either date or signature. I handed it\r\nback to Mr. Murthwaite, and owned that this curious specimen of Hindoo\r\ncorrespondence rather puzzled me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can explain the first sentence to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand the conduct of\r\nthe Indians themselves will explain the rest. The god of the moon is\r\nrepresented, in the Hindoo mythology, as a four-armed deity, seated on\r\nan antelope; and one of his titles is the regent of the night. Here,\r\nthen, to begin with, is something which looks suspiciously like an\r\nindirect reference to the Moonstone. Now, let us see what the Indians\r\ndid, after the prison authorities had allowed them to receive their\r\nletter. On the very day when they were set free they went at once to\r\nthe railway station, and took their places in the first train that\r\nstarted for London. We all thought it a pity at Frizinghall that their\r\nproceedings were not privately watched. But, after Lady Verinder had\r\ndismissed the police-officer, and had stopped all further inquiry into\r\nthe loss of the Diamond, no one else could presume to stir in the\r\nmatter. The Indians were free to go to London, and to London they went.\r\nWhat was the next news we heard of them, Mr. Bruff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were annoying Mr. Luker,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cby loitering about the\r\nhouse at Lambeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you read the report of Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s application to the magistrate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the course of his statement he referred, if you remember, to a\r\nforeign workman in his employment, whom he had just dismissed on\r\nsuspicion of attempted theft, and whom he also distrusted as possibly\r\nacting in collusion with the Indians who had annoyed him. The inference\r\nis pretty plain, Mr. Bruff, as to who wrote that letter which puzzled\r\nyou just now, and as to which of Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s Oriental treasures the\r\nworkman had attempted to steal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inference (as I hastened to acknowledge) was too plain to need\r\nbeing pointed out. I had never doubted that the Moonstone had found its\r\nway into Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s hands, at the time Mr. Murthwaite alluded to. My\r\nonly question had been, How had the Indians discovered the\r\ncircumstance? This question (the most difficult to deal with of all, as\r\nI had thought) had now received its answer, like the rest. Lawyer as I\r\nwas, I began to feel that I might trust Mr. Murthwaite to lead me\r\nblindfold through the last windings of the labyrinth, along which he\r\nhad guided me thus far. I paid him the compliment of telling him this,\r\nand found my little concession very graciously received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall give me a piece of information in your turn before we go\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must have taken the Moonstone from Yorkshire to\r\nLondon. And somebody must have raised money on it, or it would never\r\nhave been in Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s possession. Has there been any discovery made\r\nof who that person was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a story (was there not?) about Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite. I am\r\ntold he is an eminent philanthropist\xe2\x80\x94which is decidedly against him, to\r\nbegin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heartily agreed in this with Mr. Murthwaite. At the same time, I felt\r\nbound to inform him (without, it is needless to say, mentioning Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s name) that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite had been cleared of all\r\nsuspicion, on evidence which I could answer for as entirely beyond\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Murthwaite, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9clet us leave it to time to\r\nclear the matter up. In the meanwhile, Mr. Bruff, we must get back\r\nagain to the Indians, on your account. Their journey to London simply\r\nended in their becoming the victims of another defeat. The loss of\r\ntheir second chance of seizing the Diamond is mainly attributable, as I\r\nthink, to the cunning and foresight of Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x94who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand at\r\nthe top of the prosperous and ancient profession of usury for nothing!\r\nBy the prompt dismissal of the man in his employment, he deprived the\r\nIndians of the assistance which their confederate would have rendered\r\nthem in getting into the house. By the prompt transport of the\r\nMoonstone to his banker\xe2\x80\x99s, he took the conspirators by surprise before\r\nthey were prepared with a new plan for robbing him. How the Indians, in\r\nthis latter case, suspected what he had done, and how they contrived to\r\npossess themselves of his banker\xe2\x80\x99s receipt, are events too recent to\r\nneed dwelling on. Let it be enough to say that they know the Moonstone\r\nto be once more out of their reach; deposited (under the general\r\ndescription of \xe2\x80\x98a valuable of great price\xe2\x80\x99) in a banker\xe2\x80\x99s strong room.\r\nNow, Mr. Bruff, what is their third chance of seizing the Diamond? and\r\nwhen will it come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the question passed his lips, I penetrated the motive of the\r\nIndian\xe2\x80\x99s visit to my office at last!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians take it for granted, as we do,\r\nthat the Moonstone has been pledged; and they want to be certainly\r\ninformed of the earliest period at which the pledge can be\r\nredeemed\xe2\x80\x94because that will be the earliest period at which the Diamond\r\ncan be removed from the safe keeping of the bank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you you would find it out for yourself, Mr. Bruff, if I only\r\ngave you a fair chance. In a year from the time when the Moonstone was\r\npledged, the Indians will be on the watch for their third chance. Mr.\r\nLuker\xe2\x80\x99s own lips have told them how long they will have to wait, and\r\nyour respectable authority has satisfied them that Mr. Luker has spoken\r\nthe truth. When do we suppose, at a rough guess, that the Diamond found\r\nits way into the money-lender\xe2\x80\x99s hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards the end of last June,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as I can reckon\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are now in the year \xe2\x80\x99forty-eight. Very good. If the unknown\r\nperson who has pledged the Moonstone can redeem it in a year, the jewel\r\nwill be in that person\xe2\x80\x99s possession again at the end of June,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99forty-nine. I shall be thousands of miles from England and English\r\nnews at that date. But it may be worth _your_ while to take a note of\r\nit, and to arrange to be in London at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think something serious will happen?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall be safer,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9camong the fiercest fanatics\r\nof Central Asia than I should be if I crossed the door of the bank with\r\nthe Moonstone in my pocket. The Indians have been defeated twice\r\nrunning, Mr. Bruff. It\xe2\x80\x99s my firm belief that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be defeated a\r\nthird time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were the last words he said on the subject. The coffee came in;\r\nthe guests rose, and dispersed themselves about the room; and we joined\r\nthe ladies of the dinner-party upstairs.\r\n\r\nI made a note of the date, and it may not be amiss if I close my\r\nnarrative by repeating that note here:\r\n\r\n_June, \xe2\x80\x99forty-nine. Expect news of the Indians, towards the end of the\r\nmonth._\r\n\r\nAnd that done, I hand the pen, which I have now no further claim to\r\nuse, to the writer who follows me next.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Franklin Blake._\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year eighteen hundred and forty-nine I was\r\nwandering in the East, and had then recently altered the travelling\r\nplans which I had laid out some months before, and which I had\r\ncommunicated to my lawyer and my banker in London.\r\n\r\nThis change made it necessary for me to send one of my servants to\r\nobtain my letters and remittances from the English consul in a certain\r\ncity, which was no longer included as one of my resting-places in my\r\nnew travelling scheme. The man was to join me again at an appointed\r\nplace and time. An accident, for which he was not responsible, delayed\r\nhim on his errand. For a week I and my people waited, encamped on the\r\nborders of a desert. At the end of that time the missing man made his\r\nappearance, with the money and the letters, at the entrance of my tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I bring you bad news, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and pointed to one of\r\nthe letters, which had a mourning border round it, and the address on\r\nwhich was in the handwriting of Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\nI know nothing, in a case of this kind, so unendurable as suspense. The\r\nletter with the mourning border was the letter that I opened first.\r\n\r\nIt informed me that my father was dead, and that I was heir to his\r\ngreat fortune. The wealth which had thus fallen into my hands brought\r\nits responsibilities with it, and Mr. Bruff entreated me to lose no\r\ntime in returning to England.\r\n\r\nBy daybreak the next morning, I was on my way back to my own country.\r\n\r\nThe picture presented of me, by my old friend Betteredge, at the time\r\nof my departure from England, is (as I think) a little overdrawn. He\r\nhas, in his own quaint way, interpreted seriously one of his young\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s many satirical references to my foreign education; and has\r\npersuaded himself that he actually saw those French, German, and\r\nItalian sides to my character, which my lively cousin only professed to\r\ndiscover in jest, and which never had any real existence, except in our\r\ngood Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s own brain. But, barring this drawback, I am bound to\r\nown that he has stated no more than the truth in representing me as\r\nwounded to the heart by Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s treatment, and as leaving England in\r\nthe first keenness of suffering caused by the bitterest disappointment\r\nof my life.\r\n\r\nI went abroad, resolved\xe2\x80\x94if change and absence could help me\xe2\x80\x94to forget\r\nher. It is, I am persuaded, no true view of human nature which denies\r\nthat change and absence _do_ help a man under these circumstances; they\r\nforce his attention away from the exclusive contemplation of his own\r\nsorrow. I never forgot her; but the pang of remembrance lost its worst\r\nbitterness, little by little, as time, distance, and novelty interposed\r\nthemselves more and more effectually between Rachel and me.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is no less certain that, with the act of turning\r\nhomeward, the remedy which had gained its ground so steadily, began\r\nnow, just as steadily, to drop back. The nearer I drew to the country\r\nwhich she inhabited, and to the prospect of seeing her again, the more\r\nirresistibly her influence began to recover its hold on me. On leaving\r\nEngland she was the last person in the world whose name I would have\r\nsuffered to pass my lips. On returning to England, she was the first\r\nperson I inquired after, when Mr. Bruff and I met again.\r\n\r\nI was informed, of course, of all that had happened in my absence; in\r\nother words, of all that has been related here in continuation of\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s narrative\xe2\x80\x94one circumstance only being excepted. Mr. Bruff\r\ndid not, at that time, feel himself at liberty to inform me of the\r\nmotives which had privately influenced Rachel and Godfrey Ablewhite in\r\nrecalling the marriage promise, on either side. I troubled him with no\r\nembarrassing questions on this delicate subject. It was relief enough\r\nto me, after the jealous disappointment caused by hearing that she had\r\never contemplated being Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife, to know that reflection had\r\nconvinced her of acting rashly, and that she had effected her own\r\nrelease from her marriage engagement.\r\n\r\nHaving heard the story of the past, my next inquiries (still inquiries\r\nafter Rachel!) advanced naturally to the present time. Under whose care\r\nhad she been placed after leaving Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s house? and where was she\r\nliving now?\r\n\r\nShe was living under the care of a widowed sister of the late Sir John\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x94one Mrs. Merridew\xe2\x80\x94whom her mother\xe2\x80\x99s executors had requested to\r\nact as guardian, and who had accepted the proposal. They were reported\r\nto me as getting on together admirably well, and as being now\r\nestablished, for the season, in Mrs. Merridew\xe2\x80\x99s house in Portland\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after receiving this information, I was on my way to\r\nPortland Place\xe2\x80\x94without having had the courage to own it to Mr. Bruff!\r\n\r\nThe man who answered the door was not sure whether Miss Verinder was at\r\nhome or not. I sent him upstairs with my card, as the speediest way of\r\nsetting the question at rest. The man came down again with an\r\nimpenetrable face, and informed me that Miss Verinder was out.\r\n\r\nI might have suspected other people of purposely denying themselves to\r\nme. But it was impossible to suspect Rachel. I left word that I would\r\ncall again at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock I was informed for the second time that Miss Verinder\r\nwas not at home. Had any message been left for me. No message had been\r\nleft for me. Had Miss Verinder not received my card? The servant begged\r\nmy pardon\xe2\x80\x94Miss Verinder _had_ received it.\r\n\r\nThe inference was too plain to be resisted. Rachel declined to see me.\r\n\r\nOn my side, I declined to be treated in this way, without making an\r\nattempt, at least, to discover a reason for it. I sent up my name to\r\nMrs. Merridew, and requested her to favour me with a personal interview\r\nat any hour which it might be most convenient to her to name.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merridew made no difficulty about receiving me at once. I was\r\nshown into a comfortable little sitting-room, and found myself in the\r\npresence of a comfortable little elderly lady. She was so good as to\r\nfeel great regret and much surprise, entirely on my account. She was at\r\nthe same time, however, not in a position to offer me any explanation,\r\nor to press Rachel on a matter which appeared to relate to a question\r\nof private feeling alone. This was said over and over again, with a\r\npolite patience that nothing could tire; and this was all I gained by\r\napplying to Mrs. Merridew.\r\n\r\nMy last chance was to write to Rachel. My servant took a letter to her\r\nthe next day, with strict instructions to wait for an answer.\r\n\r\nThe answer came back, literally in one sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Verinder begs to decline entering into any correspondence with\r\nMr. Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFond as I was of her, I felt indignantly the insult offered to me in\r\nthat reply. Mr. Bruff came in to speak to me on business, before I had\r\nrecovered possession of myself. I dismissed the business on the spot,\r\nand laid the whole case before him. He proved to be as incapable of\r\nenlightening me as Mrs. Merridew herself. I asked him if any slander\r\nhad been spoken of me in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. Mr. Bruff was not aware of\r\nany slander of which I was the object. Had she referred to me in any\r\nway while she was staying under Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s roof? Never. Had she not so\r\nmuch as asked, during all my long absence, whether I was living or\r\ndead? No such question had ever passed her lips. I took out of my\r\npocket-book the letter which poor Lady Verinder had written to me from\r\nFrizinghall, on the day when I left her house in Yorkshire. And I\r\npointed Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s attention to these two sentences in it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe valuable assistance which you rendered to the inquiry after the\r\nlost jewel is still an unpardoned offence, in the present dreadful\r\nstate of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Moving blindfold in this matter, you have added\r\nto the burden of anxiety which she has had to bear, by innocently\r\nthreatening her secret with discovery through your exertions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the feeling towards me which is there\r\ndescribed, is as bitter as ever against me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff looked unaffectedly distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you insist on an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI own I can place no other\r\ninterpretation on her conduct than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rang the bell, and directed my servant to pack my portmanteau, and to\r\nsend out for a railway guide. Mr. Bruff asked, in astonishment, what I\r\nwas going to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Yorkshire,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cby the next train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask for what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bruff, the assistance I innocently rendered to the inquiry after\r\nthe Diamond was an unpardoned offence, in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind, nearly a year\r\nsince; and it remains an unpardoned offence still. I won\xe2\x80\x99t accept that\r\nposition! I am determined to find out the secret of her silence towards\r\nher mother, and her enmity towards _me_. If time, pains, and money can\r\ndo it, I will lay my hand on the thief who took the Moonstone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe worthy old gentleman attempted to remonstrate\xe2\x80\x94to induce me to\r\nlisten to reason\xe2\x80\x94to do his duty towards me, in short. I was deaf to\r\neverything that he could urge. No earthly consideration would, at that\r\nmoment, have shaken the resolution that was in me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take up the inquiry again,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cat the point where I\r\ndropped it; and I shall follow it onwards, step by step, till I come to\r\nthe present time. There are missing links in the evidence, as _I_ left\r\nit, which Gabriel Betteredge can supply, and to Gabriel Betteredge I\r\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTowards sunset that evening I stood again on the well-remembered\r\nterrace, and looked once more at the peaceful old country house. The\r\ngardener was the first person whom I saw in the deserted grounds. He\r\nhad left Betteredge, an hour since, sunning himself in the customary\r\ncorner of the back yard. I knew it well; and I said I would go and seek\r\nhim myself.\r\n\r\nI walked round by the familiar paths and passages, and looked in at the\r\nopen gate of the yard.\r\n\r\nThere he was\xe2\x80\x94the dear old friend of the happy days that were never to\r\ncome again\xe2\x80\x94there he was in the old corner, on the old beehive chair,\r\nwith his pipe in his mouth, and his _Robinson Crusoe_ on his lap, and\r\nhis two friends, the dogs, dozing on either side of him! In the\r\nposition in which I stood, my shadow was projected in front of me by\r\nthe last slanting rays of the sun. Either the dogs saw it, or their\r\nkeen scent informed them of my approach; they started up with a growl.\r\nStarting in his turn, the old man quieted them by a word, and then\r\nshaded his failing eyes with his hand, and looked inquiringly at the\r\nfigure at the gate.\r\n\r\nMy own eyes were full of tears. I was obliged to wait a moment before I\r\ncould trust myself to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, pointing to the well-remembered book on his knee,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chas _Robinson Crusoe_ informed you, this evening, that you might\r\nexpect to see Franklin Blake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the lord Harry, Mr. Franklin!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly\r\nwhat _Robinson Crusoe_ has done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe struggled to his feet with my assistance, and stood for a moment,\r\nlooking backwards and forwards between _Robinson Crusoe_ and me,\r\napparently at a loss to discover which of us had surprised him most.\r\nThe verdict ended in favour of the book. Holding it open before him in\r\nboth hands, he surveyed the wonderful volume with a stare of\r\nunutterable anticipation\xe2\x80\x94as if he expected to see Robinson Crusoe\r\nhimself walk out of the pages, and favour us with a personal interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the bit, Mr. Franklin!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as soon as he had recovered\r\nthe use of his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I live by bread, sir, here\xe2\x80\x99s the bit I was\r\nreading, the moment before you came in! Page one hundred and fifty-six\r\nas follows:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I stood like one Thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an\r\nApparition.\xe2\x80\x99 If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t as much as to say: \xe2\x80\x98Expect the sudden\r\nappearance of Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no meaning in the English\r\nlanguage!\xe2\x80\x9d said Betteredge, closing the book with a bang, and getting\r\none of his hands free at last to take the hand which I offered him.\r\n\r\nI had expected him, naturally enough under the circumstances, to\r\noverwhelm me with questions. But no\xe2\x80\x94the hospitable impulse was the\r\nuppermost impulse in the old servant\xe2\x80\x99s mind, when a member of the\r\nfamily appeared (no matter how!) as a visitor at the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk in, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, opening the door behind him, with his\r\nquaint old-fashioned bow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask what brings you here afterwards\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmust make you comfortable first. There have been sad changes, since you\r\nwent away. The house is shut up, and the servants are gone. Never mind\r\nthat! I\xe2\x80\x99ll cook your dinner; and the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife will make your\r\nbed\xe2\x80\x94and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a bottle of our famous Latour claret left in the\r\ncellar, down your throat, Mr. Franklin, that bottle shall go. I bid you\r\nwelcome, sir! I bid you heartily welcome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the poor old fellow,\r\nfighting manfully against the gloom of the deserted house, and\r\nreceiving me with the sociable and courteous attention of the bygone\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt vexed me to disappoint him. But the house was Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s house, now.\r\nCould I eat in it, or sleep in it, after what had happened in London?\r\nThe commonest sense of self-respect forbade me\xe2\x80\x94properly forbade me\xe2\x80\x94to\r\ncross the threshold.\r\n\r\nI took Betteredge by the arm, and led him out into the garden. There\r\nwas no help for it. I was obliged to tell him the truth. Between his\r\nattachment to Rachel, and his attachment to me, he was sorely puzzled\r\nand distressed at the turn things had taken. His opinion, when he\r\nexpressed it, was given in his usual downright manner, and was\r\nagreeably redolent of the most positive philosophy I know\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nphilosophy of the Betteredge school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Rachel has her faults\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve never denied it,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nriding the high horse, now and then, is one of them. She has been\r\ntrying to ride over _you_\xe2\x80\x94and you have put up with it. Lord, Mr.\r\nFranklin, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know women by this time better than that? You have\r\nheard me talk of the late Mrs. Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had heard him talk of the late Mrs. Betteredge pretty\r\noften\xe2\x80\x94invariably producing her as his one undeniable example of the\r\ninbred frailty and perversity of the other sex. In that capacity he\r\nexhibited her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Mr. Franklin. Now listen to me. Different women have\r\ndifferent ways of riding the high horse. The late Mrs. Betteredge took\r\nher exercise on that favourite female animal whenever I happened to\r\ndeny her anything that she had set her heart on. So sure as I came home\r\nfrom my work on these occasions, so sure was my wife to call to me up\r\nthe kitchen stairs, and to say that, after my brutal treatment of her,\r\nshe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to cook me my dinner. I put up with it for some\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94just as you are putting up with it now from Miss Rachel. At last\r\nmy patience wore out. I went downstairs, and I took Mrs.\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x94affectionately, you understand\xe2\x80\x94up in my arms, and carried\r\nher, holus-bolus, into the best parlour where she received her company.\r\nI said \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the right place for you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 and so went back to\r\nthe kitchen. I locked myself in, and took off my coat, and turned up my\r\nshirt-sleeves, and cooked my own dinner. When it was done, I served it\r\nup in my best manner, and enjoyed it most heartily. I had my pipe and\r\nmy drop of grog afterwards; and then I cleared the table, and washed\r\nthe crockery, and cleaned the knives and forks, and put the things\r\naway, and swept up the hearth. When things were as bright and clean\r\nagain, as bright and clean could be, I opened the door and let Mrs.\r\nBetteredge in. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my dinner, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98and I hope you\r\nwill find that I have left the kitchen all that your fondest wishes can\r\ndesire.\xe2\x80\x99 For the rest of that woman\xe2\x80\x99s life, Mr. Franklin, I never had\r\nto cook my dinner again! Moral: You have put up with Miss Rachel in\r\nLondon; don\xe2\x80\x99t put up with her in Yorkshire. Come back to the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite unanswerable! I could only assure my good friend that even _his_\r\npowers of persuasion were, in this case, thrown away on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely evening,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall walk to Frizinghall, and stay\r\nat the hotel, and you must come tomorrow morning and breakfast with me.\r\nI have something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge shook his head gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am heartily sorry for this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped, Mr. Franklin, to\r\nhear that things were all smooth and pleasant again between you and\r\nMiss Rachel. If you must have your own way, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no need to go to Frizinghall tonight for\r\na bed. It\xe2\x80\x99s to be had nearer than that. There\xe2\x80\x99s Hotherstone\xe2\x80\x99s Farm,\r\nbarely two miles from here. You can hardly object to _that_ on Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s account,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man added slily. \xe2\x80\x9cHotherstone lives, Mr.\r\nFranklin, on his own freehold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remembered the place the moment Betteredge mentioned it. The\r\nfarm-house stood in a sheltered inland valley, on the banks of the\r\nprettiest stream in that part of Yorkshire: and the farmer had a spare\r\nbedroom and parlour, which he was accustomed to let to artists,\r\nanglers, and tourists in general. A more agreeable place of abode,\r\nduring my stay in the neighbourhood, I could not have wished to find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre the rooms to let?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Hotherstone herself, sir, asked for my good word to recommend the\r\nrooms, yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take them, Betteredge, with the greatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went back to the yard, in which I had left my travelling-bag. After\r\nputting a stick through the handle, and swinging the bag over his\r\nshoulder, Betteredge appeared to relapse into the bewilderment which my\r\nsudden appearance had caused, when I surprised him in the beehive\r\nchair. He looked incredulously at the house, and then he wheeled about,\r\nand looked more incredulously still at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived a goodish long time in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said this best and\r\ndearest of all old servants\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut the like of this, I never did expect\r\nto see. There stands the house, and here stands Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nDamme, if one of them isn\xe2\x80\x99t turning his back on the other, and going to\r\nsleep in a lodging!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way out, wagging his head and growling ominously. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly one more miracle that _can_ happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me, over his\r\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Mr. Franklin, will be to pay me\r\nback that seven-and-sixpence you borrowed of me when you were a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis stroke of sarcasm put him in a better humour with himself and with\r\nme. We left the house, and passed through the lodge gates. Once clear\r\nof the grounds, the duties of hospitality (in Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s code of\r\nmorals) ceased, and the privileges of curiosity began.\r\n\r\nHe dropped back, so as to let me get on a level with him. \xe2\x80\x9cFine evening\r\nfor a walk, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if we had just accidentally\r\nencountered each other at that moment. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing you had gone to the\r\nhotel at Frizinghall, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have had the honour of breakfasting with you, tomorrow\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and breakfast with me at Hotherstone\xe2\x80\x99s Farm, instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged to you for your kindness, Mr. Franklin. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexactly breakfast that I was driving at. I think you mentioned that you\r\nhad something to say to me? If it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betteredge,\r\nsuddenly abandoning the crooked way, and taking the straight one, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nburning to know what\xe2\x80\x99s brought you down here, if you please, in this\r\nsudden way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat brought me here before?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Moonstone, Mr. Franklin. But what brings you now, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Moonstone again, Betteredge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man suddenly stood still, and looked at me in the grey twilight\r\nas if he suspected his own ears of deceiving him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s a joke, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a little dull\r\nin my old age. I don\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no joke,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to take up the inquiry\r\nwhich was dropped when I left England. I have come here to do what\r\nnobody has done yet\xe2\x80\x94to find out who took the Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Diamond be, Mr. Franklin! Take my advice, and let the Diamond\r\nbe! That cursed Indian jewel has misguided everybody who has come near\r\nit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your money and your temper\xe2\x80\x94in the fine spring time of\r\nyour life, sir\xe2\x80\x94by meddling with the Moonstone. How can _you_ hope to\r\nsucceed (saving your presence), when Sergeant Cuff himself made a mess\r\nof it? Sergeant Cuff!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Betteredge, shaking his forefinger at\r\nme sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest policeman in England!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind is made up, my old friend. Even Sergeant Cuff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t daunt\r\nme. By-the-bye, I may want to speak to him, sooner or later. Have you\r\nheard anything of him lately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sergeant won\xe2\x80\x99t help you, Mr. Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been an event, sir, in the police-circles, since you went\r\naway. The great Cuff has retired from business. He has got a little\r\ncottage at Dorking; and he\xe2\x80\x99s up to his eyes in the growing of roses. I\r\nhave it in his own handwriting, Mr. Franklin. He has grown the white\r\nmoss rose, without budding it on the dog-rose first. And Mr. Begbie the\r\ngardener is to go to Dorking, and own that the Sergeant has beaten him\r\nat last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must do without Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelp. And I must trust to you, at starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is likely enough that I spoke rather carelessly.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Betteredge seemed to be piqued by something in the reply\r\nwhich I had just made to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might trust to worse than me, Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x94I can tell you that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said a little sharply.\r\n\r\nThe tone in which he retorted, and a certain disturbance, after he had\r\nspoken, which I detected in his manner, suggested to me that he was\r\npossessed of some information which he hesitated to communicate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect you to help me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cin picking up the fragments of\r\nevidence which Sergeant Cuff has left behind him. I know you can do\r\nthat. Can you do no more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more can you expect from me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Betteredge, with an\r\nappearance of the utmost humility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect more\xe2\x80\x94from what you said just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMere boasting, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man obstinately. \xe2\x80\x9cSome\r\npeople are born boasters, and they never get over it to their dying\r\nday. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was only one way to take with him. I appealed to his interest in\r\nRachel, and his interest in me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge, would you be glad to hear that Rachel and I were good\r\nfriends again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have served your family, sir, to mighty little purpose, if you doubt\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember how Rachel treated me, before I left England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs well as if it was yesterday! My lady herself wrote you a letter\r\nabout it; and you were so good as to show the letter to me. It said\r\nthat Miss Rachel was mortally offended with you, for the part you had\r\ntaken in trying to recover her jewel. And neither my lady, nor you, nor\r\nanybody else could guess why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true, Betteredge! And I come back from my travels, and find her\r\nmortally offended with me still. I knew that the Diamond was at the\r\nbottom of it, last year, and I know that the Diamond is at the bottom\r\nof it now. I have tried to speak to her, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t see me. I have\r\ntried to write to her, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t answer me. How, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nam I to clear the matter up? The chance of searching into the loss of\r\nthe Moonstone, is the one chance of inquiry that Rachel herself has\r\nleft me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words evidently put the case before him, as he had not seen it\r\nyet. He asked a question which satisfied me that I had shaken him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no ill-feeling in this, Mr. Franklin, on your side\xe2\x80\x94is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was some anger,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I left London. But that is\r\nall worn out now. I want to make Rachel come to an understanding with\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94and I want nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any fear, sir\xe2\x80\x94supposing you make any discoveries\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nregard to what you may find out about Miss Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI understood the jealous belief in his young mistress which prompted\r\nthose words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as certain of her as you are,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fullest\r\ndisclosure of her secret will reveal nothing that can alter her place\r\nin your estimation, or in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s last-left scruples vanished at that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am doing wrong to help you, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9call I\r\ncan say is\xe2\x80\x94I am as innocent of seeing it as the babe unborn! I can put\r\nyou on the road to discovery, if you can only go on by yourself. You\r\nremember that poor girl of ours\xe2\x80\x94Rosanna Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always thought she had some sort of confession in regard to this\r\nmatter of the Moonstone, which she wanted to make to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t account for her strange conduct in any other\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may set that doubt at rest, Mr. Franklin, whenever you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was my turn to come to a standstill now. I tried vainly, in the\r\ngathering darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, I\r\nasked a little impatiently what he meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Betteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean what I say. Rosanna\r\nSpearman left a sealed letter behind her\xe2\x80\x94a letter addressed to _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the possession of a friend of hers, at Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole. You must have\r\nheard tell, when you were here last, sir, of Limping Lucy\xe2\x80\x94a lame girl\r\nwith a crutch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, Mr. Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the letter forwarded to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLimping Lucy has a will of her own, sir. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give it into any\r\nhands but yours. And you had left England before I could write to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go back, Betteredge, and get it at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late, sir, tonight. They\xe2\x80\x99re great savers of candles along our\r\ncoast; and they go to bed early at Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! We might get there in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ might, sir. And when you did get there, you would find the door\r\nlocked. He pointed to a light, glimmering below us; and, at the same\r\nmoment, I heard through the stillness of the evening the bubbling of a\r\nstream. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the Farm, Mr. Franklin! Make yourself comfortable for\r\ntonight, and come to me tomorrow morning if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so kind?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go with me to the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s cottage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs early, Mr. Franklin, as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe descended the path that led to the Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nI have only the most indistinct recollection of what happened at\r\nHotherstone\xe2\x80\x99s Farm.\r\n\r\nI remember a hearty welcome; a prodigious supper, which would have fed\r\na whole village in the East; a delightfully clean bedroom, with nothing\r\nin it to regret but that detestable product of the folly of our\r\nforefathers\xe2\x80\x94a feather-bed; a restless night, with much kindling of\r\nmatches, and many lightings of one little candle; and an immense\r\nsensation of relief when the sun rose, and there was a prospect of\r\ngetting up.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged over-night with Betteredge, that I was to call for\r\nhim, on our way to Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, as early as I liked\xe2\x80\x94which, interpreted\r\nby my impatience to get possession of the letter, meant as early as I\r\ncould. Without waiting for breakfast at the Farm, I took a crust of\r\nbread in my hand, and set forth, in some doubt whether I should not\r\nsurprise the excellent Betteredge in his bed. To my great relief he\r\nproved to be quite as excited about the coming event as I was. I found\r\nhim ready, and waiting for me, with his stick in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you this morning, Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery poorly, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry to hear it. What do you complain of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI complain of a new disease, Mr. Franklin, of my own inventing. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to alarm you, but you\xe2\x80\x99re certain to catch it before the\r\nmorning is out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel an uncomfortable heat at the pit of your stomach, sir? and\r\na nasty thumping at the top of your head? Ah! not yet? It will lay hold\r\nof you at Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, Mr. Franklin. I call it the detective-fever; and\r\n_I_ first caught it in the company of Sergeant Cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye! aye! and the cure in this instance is to open Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, I suppose? Come along, and let\xe2\x80\x99s get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, we found the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s wife astir in her kitchen. On\r\nmy presentation by Betteredge, good Mrs. Yolland performed a social\r\nceremony, strictly reserved (as I afterwards learnt) for strangers of\r\ndistinction. She put a bottle of Dutch gin and a couple of clean pipes\r\non the table, and opened the conversation by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat news from\r\nLondon, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could find an answer to this immensely comprehensive question,\r\nan apparition advanced towards me, out of a dark corner of the kitchen.\r\nA wan, wild, haggard girl, with remarkably beautiful hair, and with a\r\nfierce keenness in her eyes, came limping up on a crutch to the table\r\nat which I was sitting, and looked at me as if I was an object of\r\nmingled interest and horror, which it quite fascinated her to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Betteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without taking her eyes off me, \xe2\x80\x9cmention\r\nhis name again, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Betteredge (with a strong emphasis on\r\n_gentleman_), \xe2\x80\x9cis Mr. Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl turned her back on me, and suddenly left the room. Good Mrs.\r\nYolland\xe2\x80\x94as I believe\xe2\x80\x94made some apologies for her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s odd\r\nbehaviour, and Betteredge (probably) translated them into polite\r\nEnglish. I speak of this in complete uncertainty. My attention was\r\nabsorbed in following the sound of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s crutch. Thump-thump, up\r\nthe wooden stairs; thump-thump across the room above our heads;\r\nthump-thump down the stairs again\xe2\x80\x94and there stood the apparition at the\r\nopen door, with a letter in its hand, beckoning me out!\r\n\r\nI left more apologies in course of delivery behind me, and followed\r\nthis strange creature\xe2\x80\x94limping on before me, faster and faster\xe2\x80\x94down the\r\nslope of the beach. She led me behind some boats, out of sight and\r\nhearing of the few people in the fishing-village, and then stopped, and\r\nfaced me for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to look at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the expression on her face. I inspired her with\r\nthe strongest emotions of abhorrence and disgust. Let me not be vain\r\nenough to say that no woman had ever looked at me in this manner\r\nbefore. I will only venture on the more modest assertion that no woman\r\nhad ever let me perceive it yet. There is a limit to the length of the\r\ninspection which a man can endure, under certain circumstances. I\r\nattempted to direct Limping Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s attention to some less revolting\r\nobject than my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have got a letter to give me,\xe2\x80\x9d I began. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it the letter\r\nthere, in your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that again,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only answer I received.\r\n\r\nI repeated the words, like a good child learning its lesson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, speaking to herself, but keeping her eyes still\r\nmercilessly fixed on me. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t find out what she saw in his face. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t guess what she heard in his voice.\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly looked away from\r\nme, and rested her head wearily on the top of her crutch. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my poor\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in the first soft tones which had fallen from her, in\r\nmy hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my lost darling! what could you see in this man?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlifted her head again fiercely, and looked at me once more. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\r\neat and drink?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nI did my best to preserve my gravity, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see a poor girl in service, do you feel no remorse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. Why should I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe abruptly thrust the letter (as the phrase is) into my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI never set eyes on you before.\r\nGod Almighty forbid I should ever set eyes on you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those parting words she limped away from me at the top of her\r\nspeed. The one interpretation that I could put on her conduct has, no\r\ndoubt, been anticipated by everybody. I could only suppose that she was\r\nmad.\r\n\r\nHaving reached that inevitable conclusion, I turned to the more\r\ninteresting object of investigation which was presented to me by\r\nRosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s letter. The address was written as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nFranklin Blake, Esq. To be given into his own hands (and not to be\r\ntrusted to anyone else), by Lucy Yolland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI broke the seal. The envelope contained a letter: and this, in its\r\nturn, contained a slip of paper. I read the letter first:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x94If you are curious to know the meaning of my behaviour to you,\r\nwhilst you were staying in the house of my mistress, Lady Verinder, do\r\nwhat you are told to do in the memorandum enclosed with this\xe2\x80\x94and do it\r\nwithout any person being present to overlook you. Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cROSANNA SPEARMAN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI turned to the slip of paper next. Here is the literal copy of it,\r\nword for word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMemorandum:\xe2\x80\x94To go to the Shivering Sand at the turn of the tide. To\r\nwalk out on the South Spit, until I get the South Spit Beacon, and the\r\nflagstaff at the Coast-guard station above Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole in a line\r\ntogether. To lay down on the rocks, a stick, or any straight thing to\r\nguide my hand, exactly in the line of the beacon and the flagstaff. To\r\ntake care, in doing this, that one end of the stick shall be at the\r\nedge of the rocks, on the side of them which overlooks the quicksand.\r\nTo feel along the stick, among the seaweed (beginning from the end of\r\nthe stick which points towards the beacon), for the Chain. To run my\r\nhand along the Chain, when found, until I come to the part of it which\r\nstretches over the edge of the rocks, down into the quicksand. _And\r\nthen, to pull the chain._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust as I had read the last words\xe2\x80\x94underlined in the original\xe2\x80\x94I heard\r\nthe voice of Betteredge behind me. The inventor of the detective-fever\r\nhad completely succumbed to that irresistible malady. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it\r\nany longer, Mr. Franklin. What does her letter say? For mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nsir, tell us, what does her letter say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI handed him the letter, and the memorandum. He read the first without\r\nappearing to be much interested in it. But the second\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmemorandum\xe2\x80\x94produced a strong impression on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sergeant said it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Betteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom first to last, sir, the\r\nSergeant said she had got a memorandum of the hiding-place. And here it\r\nis! Lord save us, Mr. Franklin, here is the secret that puzzled\r\neverybody, from the great Cuff downwards, ready and waiting, as one may\r\nsay, to show itself to _you!_ It\xe2\x80\x99s the ebb now, sir, as anybody may see\r\nfor themselves. How long will it be till the turn of the tide?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlooked up, and observed a lad at work, at some little distance from us,\r\nmending a net. \xe2\x80\x9cTammie Bright!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d Tammie shouted back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen\xe2\x80\x99s the turn of the tide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe both looked at our watches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can go round by the coast, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betteredge; \xe2\x80\x9cand get\r\nto the quicksand in that way with plenty of time to spare. What do you\r\nsay, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn our way to the Shivering Sand, I applied to Betteredge to revive my\r\nmemory of events (as affecting Rosanna Spearman) at the period of\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry. With my old friend\xe2\x80\x99s help, I soon had the\r\nsuccession of circumstances clearly registered in my mind. Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney to Frizinghall, when the whole household believed her to be ill\r\nin her own room\xe2\x80\x94Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious employment of the night-time with\r\nher door locked, and her candle burning till the morning\xe2\x80\x94Rosanna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicious purchase of the japanned tin case, and the two dog\xe2\x80\x99s chains\r\nfrom Mrs. Yolland\xe2\x80\x94the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s positive conviction that Rosanna had\r\nhidden something at the Shivering Sand, and the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s absolute\r\nignorance as to what that something might be\xe2\x80\x94all these strange results\r\nof the abortive inquiry into the loss of the Moonstone were clearly\r\npresent to me again, when we reached the quicksand, and walked out\r\ntogether on the low ledge of rocks called the South Spit.\r\n\r\nWith Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s help, I soon stood in the right position to see the\r\nBeacon and the Coast-guard flagstaff in a line together. Following the\r\nmemorandum as our guide, we next laid my stick in the necessary\r\ndirection, as neatly as we could, on the uneven surface of the rocks.\r\nAnd then we looked at our watches once more.\r\n\r\nIt wanted nearly twenty minutes yet of the turn of the tide. I\r\nsuggested waiting through this interval on the beach, instead of on the\r\nwet and slippery surface of the rocks. Having reached the dry sand, I\r\nprepared to sit down; and, greatly to my surprise, Betteredge prepared\r\nto leave me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going away for?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the letter again, sir, and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA glance at the letter reminded me that I was charged, when I made my\r\ndiscovery, to make it alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard enough for me to leave you, at such a time as this,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBetteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she died a dreadful death, poor soul\xe2\x80\x94and I feel a kind\r\nof call on me, Mr. Franklin, to humour that fancy of hers. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the letter against your\r\nletting out the secret afterwards. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hang about in the\r\nfir-plantation, and wait till you pick me up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be longer than you\r\ncan help, sir. The detective-fever isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy disease to deal with,\r\nunder _these_ circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that parting caution, he left me.\r\n\r\nThe interval of expectation, short as it was when reckoned by the\r\nmeasure of time, assumed formidable proportions when reckoned by the\r\nmeasure of suspense. This was one of the occasions on which the\r\ninvaluable habit of smoking becomes especially precious and\r\nconsolatory. I lit a cigar, and sat down on the slope of the beach.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight poured its unclouded beauty on every object that I could\r\nsee. The exquisite freshness of the air made the mere act of living and\r\nbreathing a luxury. Even the lonely little bay welcomed the morning\r\nwith a show of cheerfulness; and the bared wet surface of the quicksand\r\nitself, glittering with a golden brightness, hid the horror of its\r\nfalse brown face under a passing smile. It was the finest day I had\r\nseen since my return to England.\r\n\r\nThe turn of the tide came, before my cigar was finished. I saw the\r\npreliminary heaving of the Sand, and then the awful shiver that crept\r\nover its surface\xe2\x80\x94as if some spirit of terror lived and moved and\r\nshuddered in the fathomless deeps beneath. I threw away my cigar, and\r\nwent back again to the rocks.\r\n\r\nMy directions in the memorandum instructed me to feel along the line\r\ntraced by the stick, beginning with the end which was nearest to the\r\nbeacon.\r\n\r\nI advanced, in this manner, more than half way along the stick, without\r\nencountering anything but the edges of the rocks. An inch or two\r\nfurther on, however, my patience was rewarded. In a narrow little\r\nfissure, just within reach of my forefinger, I felt the chain.\r\nAttempting, next, to follow it, by touch, in the direction of the\r\nquicksand, I found my progress stopped by a thick growth of\r\nseaweed\xe2\x80\x94which had fastened itself into the fissure, no doubt, in the\r\ntime that had elapsed since Rosanna Spearman had chosen her\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nIt was equally impossible to pull up the seaweed, or to force my hand\r\nthrough it. After marking the spot indicated by the end of the stick\r\nwhich was placed nearest to the quicksand, I determined to pursue the\r\nsearch for the chain on a plan of my own. My idea was to \xe2\x80\x9csound\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nimmediately under the rocks, on the chance of recovering the lost trace\r\nof the chain at the point at which it entered the sand. I took up the\r\nstick, and knelt down on the brink of the South Spit.\r\n\r\nIn this position, my face was within a few feet of the surface of the\r\nquicksand. The sight of it so near me, still disturbed at intervals by\r\nits hideous shivering fit, shook my nerves for the moment. A horrible\r\nfancy that the dead woman might appear on the scene of her suicide, to\r\nassist my search\xe2\x80\x94an unutterable dread of seeing her rise through the\r\nheaving surface of the sand, and point to the place\xe2\x80\x94forced itself into\r\nmy mind, and turned me cold in the warm sunlight. I own I closed my\r\neyes at the moment when the point of the stick first entered the\r\nquicksand.\r\n\r\nThe instant afterwards, before the stick could have been submerged more\r\nthan a few inches, I was free from the hold of my own superstitious\r\nterror, and was throbbing with excitement from head to foot. Sounding\r\nblindfold, at my first attempt\xe2\x80\x94at that first attempt I had sounded\r\nright! The stick struck the chain.\r\n\r\nTaking a firm hold of the roots of the seaweed with my left hand, I\r\nlaid myself down over the brink, and felt with my right hand under the\r\noverhanging edges of the rock. My right hand found the chain.\r\n\r\nI drew it up without the slightest difficulty. And there was the\r\njapanned tin case fastened to the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe action of the water had so rusted the chain, that it was impossible\r\nfor me to unfasten it from the hasp which attached it to the case.\r\nPutting the case between my knees and exerting my utmost strength, I\r\ncontrived to draw off the cover. Some white substance filled the whole\r\ninterior when I looked in. I put in my hand, and found it to be linen.\r\n\r\nIn drawing out the linen, I also drew out a letter crumpled up with it.\r\nAfter looking at the direction, and discovering that it bore my name, I\r\nput the letter in my pocket, and completely removed the linen. It came\r\nout in a thick roll, moulded, of course, to the shape of the case in\r\nwhich it had been so long confined, and perfectly preserved from any\r\ninjury by the sea.\r\n\r\nI carried the linen to the dry sand of the beach, and there unrolled\r\nand smoothed it out. There was no mistaking it as an article of dress.\r\nIt was a nightgown.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost side, when I spread it out, presented to view innumerable\r\nfolds and creases, and nothing more. I tried the undermost side,\r\nnext\xe2\x80\x94and instantly discovered the smear of the paint from the door of\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s boudoir!\r\n\r\nMy eyes remained riveted on the stain, and my mind took me back at a\r\nleap from present to past. The very words of Sergeant Cuff recurred to\r\nme, as if the man himself was at my side again, pointing to the\r\nunanswerable inference which he drew from the smear on the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind out whether there is any article of dress in this house with the\r\nstain of paint on it. Find out who that dress belongs to. Find out how\r\nthe person can account for having been in the room, and smeared the\r\npaint between midnight and three in the morning. If the person can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsatisfy you, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t far to look for the hand that took the\r\nDiamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne after another those words travelled over my memory, repeating\r\nthemselves again and again with a wearisome, mechanical reiteration. I\r\nwas roused from what felt like a trance of many hours\xe2\x80\x94from what was\r\nreally, no doubt, the pause of a few moments only\xe2\x80\x94by a voice calling to\r\nme. I looked up, and saw that Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s patience had failed him at\r\nlast. He was just visible between the sandhills, returning to the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThe old man\xe2\x80\x99s appearance recalled me, the moment I perceived it, to my\r\nsense of present things, and reminded me that the inquiry which I had\r\npursued thus far still remained incomplete. I had discovered the smear\r\non the nightgown. To whom did the nightgown belong?\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to consult the letter in my pocket\xe2\x80\x94the letter\r\nwhich I had found in the case.\r\n\r\nAs I raised my hand to take it out, I remembered that there was a\r\nshorter way to discovery than this. The nightgown itself would reveal\r\nthe truth, for, in all probability, the nightgown was marked with its\r\nowner\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nI took it up from the sand, and looked for the mark.\r\n\r\nI found the mark, and read\xe2\x80\x94MY OWN NAME.\r\n\r\nThere were the familiar letters which told me that the nightgown was\r\nmine. I looked up from them. There was the sun; there were the\r\nglittering waters of the bay; there was old Betteredge, advancing\r\nnearer and nearer to me. I looked back again at the letters. My own\r\nname. Plainly confronting me\xe2\x80\x94my own name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf time, pains, and money can do it, I will lay my hand on the thief\r\nwho took the Moonstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I had left London, with those words on my\r\nlips. I had penetrated the secret which the quicksand had kept from\r\nevery other living creature. And, on the unanswerable evidence of the\r\npaint-stain, I had discovered Myself as the Thief.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nI have not a word to say about my own sensations.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that the shock inflicted on me completely suspended my\r\nthinking and feeling power. I certainly could not have known what I was\r\nabout when Betteredge joined me\xe2\x80\x94for I have it on his authority that I\r\nlaughed, when he asked what was the matter, and putting the nightgown\r\ninto his hands, told him to read the riddle for himself.\r\n\r\nOf what was said between us on the beach, I have not the faintest\r\nrecollection. The first place in which I can now see myself again\r\nplainly is the plantation of firs. Betteredge and I are walking back\r\ntogether to the house; and Betteredge is telling me that I shall be\r\nable to face it, and he will be able to face it, when we have had a\r\nglass of grog.\r\n\r\nThe scene shifts from the plantation, to Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nsitting-room. My resolution not to enter Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s house is forgotten. I\r\nfeel gratefully the coolness and shadiness and quiet of the room. I\r\ndrink the grog (a perfectly new luxury to me, at that time of day),\r\nwhich my good old friend mixes with icy-cold water from the well. Under\r\nany other circumstances, the drink would simply stupefy me. As things\r\nare, it strings up my nerves. I begin to \xe2\x80\x9cface it,\xe2\x80\x9d as Betteredge has\r\npredicted. And Betteredge, on his side, begins to \xe2\x80\x9cface it,\xe2\x80\x9d too.\r\n\r\nThe picture which I am now presenting of myself, will, I suspect, be\r\nthought a very strange one, to say the least of it. Placed in a\r\nsituation which may, I think, be described as entirely without\r\nparallel, what is the first proceeding to which I resort? Do I seclude\r\nmyself from all human society? Do I set my mind to analyse the\r\nabominable impossibility which, nevertheless, confronts me as an\r\nundeniable fact? Do I hurry back to London by the first train to\r\nconsult the highest authorities, and to set a searching inquiry on foot\r\nimmediately? No. I accept the shelter of a house which I had resolved\r\nnever to degrade myself by entering again; and I sit, tippling spirits\r\nand water in the company of an old servant, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning. Is this the conduct that might have been expected from a man\r\nplaced in my horrible position? I can only answer that the sight of old\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s familiar face was an inexpressible comfort to me, and that\r\nthe drinking of old Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s grog helped me, as I believe nothing\r\nelse would have helped me, in the state of complete bodily and mental\r\nprostration into which I had fallen. I can only offer this excuse for\r\nmyself; and I can only admire that invariable preservation of dignity,\r\nand that strictly logical consistency of conduct which distinguish\r\nevery man and woman who may read these lines, in every emergency of\r\ntheir lives from the cradle to the grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Franklin, there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing certain, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBetteredge, throwing the nightgown down on the table between us, and\r\npointing to it as if it was a living creature that could hear him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He\xe2\x80\x99s_ a liar, to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis comforting view of the matter was not the view that presented\r\nitself to my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as innocent of all knowledge of having taken the Diamond as you\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is the witness against me! The paint on the\r\nnightgown, and the name on the nightgown are facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge lifted my glass, and put it persuasively into my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFacts?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a drop more grog, Mr. Franklin, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget over the weakness of believing in facts! Foul play, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, dropping his voice confidentially. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is how I read the\r\nriddle. Foul play somewhere\xe2\x80\x94and you and I must find it out. Was there\r\nnothing else in the tin case, when you put your hand into it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question instantly reminded me of the letter in my pocket. I took\r\nit out, and opened it. It was a letter of many pages, closely written.\r\nI looked impatiently for the signature at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cRosanna Spearman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I read the name, a sudden remembrance illuminated my mind, and a\r\nsudden suspicion rose out of the new light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cRosanna Spearman came to my aunt out of a\r\nreformatory? Rosanna Spearman had once been a thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that, Mr. Franklin. What of it now, if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it now? How do we know she may not have stolen the Diamond\r\nafter all? How do we know she may not have smeared my nightgown\r\npurposely with the paint?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge laid his hand on my arm, and stopped me before I could say\r\nany more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be cleared of this, Mr. Franklin, beyond all doubt. But I\r\nhope you won\xe2\x80\x99t be cleared in _that_ way. See what the letter says, sir.\r\nIn justice to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s memory, see what it says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt the earnestness with which he spoke\xe2\x80\x94felt it as a friendly rebuke\r\nto me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall form your own judgment on her letter,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill read it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began\xe2\x80\x94and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir\xe2\x80\x94I have something to own to you. A confession which means much\r\nmisery, may sometimes be made in very few words. This confession can be\r\nmade in three words. I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter dropped from my hand. I looked at Betteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name\r\nof Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to shrink from answering the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and Limping Lucy were alone together this morning, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she say nothing about Rosanna Spearman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never even mentioned Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease to go back to the letter, Mr. Franklin. I tell you plainly, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t find it in my heart to distress you, after what you have had to\r\nbear already. Let her speak for herself, sir. And get on with your\r\ngrog. For your own sake, get on with your grog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI resumed the reading of the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very disgraceful to me to tell you this, if I was a living\r\nwoman when you read it. I shall be dead and gone, sir, when you find my\r\nletter. It is that which makes me bold. Not even my grave will be left\r\nto tell of me. I may own the truth\xe2\x80\x94with the quicksand waiting to hide\r\nme when the words are written.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, you will find your nightgown in my hiding-place, with the\r\nsmear of the paint on it; and you will want to know how it came to be\r\nhidden by me? and why I said nothing to you about it in my life-time? I\r\nhave only one reason to give. I did these strange things, because I\r\nloved you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you with much about myself, or my life, before you\r\ncame to my lady\xe2\x80\x99s house. Lady Verinder took me out of a reformatory. I\r\nhad gone to the reformatory from the prison. I was put in the prison,\r\nbecause I was a thief. I was a thief, because my mother went on the\r\nstreets when I was quite a little girl. My mother went on the streets,\r\nbecause the gentleman who was my father deserted her. There is no need\r\nto tell such a common story as this, at any length. It is told quite\r\noften enough in the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Verinder was very kind to me, and Mr. Betteredge was very kind to\r\nme. Those two, and the matron at the reformatory, are the only good\r\npeople I have ever met with in all my life. I might have got on in my\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94not happily\xe2\x80\x94but I might have got on, if you had not come\r\nvisiting. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame _you_, sir. It\xe2\x80\x99s my fault\xe2\x80\x94all my fault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember when you came out on us from among the sandhills, that\r\nmorning, looking for Mr. Betteredge? You were like a prince in a\r\nfairy-story. You were like a lover in a dream. You were the most\r\nadorable human creature I had ever seen. Something that felt like the\r\nhappy life I had never led yet, leapt up in me at the instant I set\r\neyes on you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at this if you can help it. Oh, if I could\r\nonly make you feel how serious it is to _me!_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went back to the house, and wrote your name and mine in my work-box,\r\nand drew a true lovers\xe2\x80\x99 knot under them. Then, some devil\xe2\x80\x94no, I ought\r\nto say some good angel\xe2\x80\x94whispered to me, \xe2\x80\x98Go and look in the glass.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nglass told me\xe2\x80\x94never mind what. I was too foolish to take the warning. I\r\nwent on getting fonder and fonder of you, just as if I was a lady in\r\nyour own rank of life, and the most beautiful creature your eyes ever\r\nrested on. I tried\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear, how I tried\xe2\x80\x94to get you to look at me. If\r\nyou had known how I used to cry at night with the misery and the\r\nmortification of your never taking any notice of me, you would have\r\npitied me perhaps, and have given me a look now and then to live on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been no very kind look, perhaps, if you had known how I\r\nhated Miss Rachel. I believe I found out you were in love with her,\r\nbefore you knew it yourself. She used to give you roses to wear in your\r\nbutton-hole. Ah, Mr. Franklin, you wore _my_ roses oftener than either\r\nyou or she thought! The only comfort I had at that time, was putting my\r\nrose secretly in your glass of water, in place of hers\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nthrowing her rose away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she had been really as pretty as you thought her, I might have\r\nborne it better. No; I believe I should have been more spiteful against\r\nher still. Suppose you put Miss Rachel into a servant\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and took\r\nher ornaments off? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is the use of my writing in this\r\nway. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be denied that she had a bad figure; she was too thin.\r\nBut who can tell what the men like? And young ladies may behave in a\r\nmanner which would cost a servant her place. It\xe2\x80\x99s no business of mine.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t expect you to read my letter, if I write it in this way. But it\r\ndoes stir one up to hear Miss Rachel called pretty, when one knows all\r\nthe time that it\xe2\x80\x99s her dress does it, and her confidence in herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry not to lose patience with me, sir. I will get on as fast as I can\r\nto the time which is sure to interest you\xe2\x80\x94the time when the Diamond was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is one thing which I have got it on my mind to tell you\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy life was not a very hard life to bear, while I was a thief. It was\r\nonly when they had taught me at the reformatory to feel my own\r\ndegradation, and to try for better things, that the days grew long and\r\nweary. Thoughts of the future forced themselves on me now. I felt the\r\ndreadful reproach that honest people\xe2\x80\x94even the kindest of honest\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94were to me in themselves. A heart-breaking sensation of\r\nloneliness kept with me, go where I might, and do what I might, and see\r\nwhat persons I might. It was my duty, I know, to try and get on with my\r\nfellow-servants in my new place. Somehow, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make friends with\r\nthem. They looked (or I thought they looked) as if they suspected what\r\nI had been. I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret, far from it, having been roused to make the\r\neffort to be a reformed woman\xe2\x80\x94but, indeed, indeed it was a weary life.\r\nYou had come across it like a beam of sunshine at first\xe2\x80\x94and then you\r\ntoo failed me. I was mad enough to love you; and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nattract your notice. There was great misery\xe2\x80\x94there really was great\r\nmisery in that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am coming to what I wanted to tell you. In those days of\r\nbitterness, I went two or three times, when it was my turn to go out,\r\nto my favourite place\xe2\x80\x94the beach above the Shivering Sand. And I said to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x98I think it will end here. When I can bear it no longer, I\r\nthink it will end here.\xe2\x80\x99 You will understand, sir, that the place had\r\nlaid a kind of spell on me before you came. I had always had a notion\r\nthat something would happen to me at the quicksand. But I had never\r\nlooked at it, with the thought of its being the means of my making away\r\nwith myself, till the time came of which I am now writing. Then I did\r\nthink that here was a place which would end all my troubles for me in a\r\nmoment or two\xe2\x80\x94and hide me for ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all I have to say about myself, reckoning from the morning\r\nwhen I first saw you, to the morning when the alarm was raised in the\r\nhouse that the Diamond was lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so aggravated by the foolish talk among the women servants, all\r\nwondering who was to be suspected first; and I was so angry with you\r\n(knowing no better at that time) for the pains you took in hunting for\r\nthe jewel, and sending for the police, that I kept as much as possible\r\naway by myself, until later in the day, when the officer from\r\nFrizinghall came to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Seegrave began, as you may remember, by setting a guard on the\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s bedrooms; and the women all followed him upstairs in a rage, to\r\nknow what he meant by the insult he had put on them. I went with the\r\nrest, because if I had done anything different from the rest, Mr.\r\nSeegrave was the sort of man who would have suspected me directly. We\r\nfound him in Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s room. He told us he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of\r\nwomen there; and he pointed to the smear on the painted door, and said\r\nsome of our petticoats had done the mischief, and sent us all\r\ndownstairs again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter leaving Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s room, I stopped a moment on one of the\r\nlandings, by myself, to see if I had got the paint-stain by any chance\r\non _my_ gown. Penelope Betteredge (the only one of the women with whom\r\nI was on friendly terms) passed, and noticed what I was about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself, Rosanna,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98The paint on Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s door has been dry for hours. If Mr. Seegrave hadn\xe2\x80\x99t set a\r\nwatch on our bedrooms, I might have told him as much. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\n_you_ think\xe2\x80\x94_I_ was never so insulted before in my life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPenelope was a hot-tempered girl. I quieted her, and brought her back\r\nto what she had said about the paint on the door having been dry for\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How do you know that?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I was with Miss Rachel, and Mr. Franklin, all yesterday morning,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nPenelope said, \xe2\x80\x98mixing the colours, while they finished the door. I\r\nheard Miss Rachel ask whether the door would be dry that evening, in\r\ntime for the birthday company to see it. And Mr. Franklin shook his\r\nhead, and said it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be dry in less than twelve hours. It was\r\nlong past luncheon-time\xe2\x80\x94it was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock before they had done. What\r\ndoes your arithmetic say, Rosanna? Mine says the door was dry by three\r\nthis morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Did some of the ladies go upstairs yesterday evening to see it?\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nasked. \xe2\x80\x98I thought I heard Miss Rachel warning them to keep clear of the\r\ndoor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98None of the ladies made the smear,\xe2\x80\x99 Penelope answered. \xe2\x80\x98I left Miss\r\nRachel in bed at twelve last night. And I noticed the door, and there\r\nwas nothing wrong with it then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t you to mention this to Mr. Seegrave, Penelope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word to help Mr. Seegrave for anything that could be\r\noffered to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went to her work, and I went to mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy work, sir, was to make your bed, and to put your room tidy. It was\r\nthe happiest hour I had in the whole day. I used to kiss the pillow on\r\nwhich your head had rested all night. No matter who has done it since,\r\nyou have never had your clothes folded as nicely as I folded them for\r\nyou. Of all the little knick-knacks in your dressing-case, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\none that had so much as a speck on it. You never noticed it, any more\r\nthan you noticed me. I beg your pardon; I am forgetting myself. I will\r\nmake haste, and go on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I went in that morning to do my work in your room. There was\r\nyour nightgown tossed across the bed, just as you had thrown it off. I\r\ntook it up to fold it\xe2\x80\x94and I saw the stain of the paint from Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s door!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so startled by the discovery that I ran out with the nightgown\r\nin my hand, and made for the back stairs, and locked myself into my own\r\nroom, to look at it in a place where nobody could intrude and interrupt\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I got my breath again, I called to mind my talk with\r\nPenelope, and I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the proof that he was in Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room between twelve last night, and three this\r\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not tell you in plain words what was the first suspicion that\r\ncrossed my mind, when I had made that discovery. You would only be\r\nangry\xe2\x80\x94and, if you were angry, you might tear my letter up and read no\r\nmore of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be enough, if you please, to say only this. After thinking it\r\nover to the best of my ability, I made it out that the thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlikely, for a reason that I will tell you. If you had been in Miss\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, at that time of night, with Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge (and if you had been foolish enough to forget to take care of\r\nthe wet door) _she_ would have reminded you\xe2\x80\x94_she_ would never have let\r\nyou carry away such a witness against her, as the witness I was looking\r\nat now! At the same time, I own I was not completely certain in my own\r\nmind that I had proved my own suspicion to be wrong. You will not have\r\nforgotten that I have owned to hating Miss Rachel. Try to think, if you\r\ncan, that there was a little of that hatred in all this. It ended in my\r\ndetermining to keep the nightgown, and to wait, and watch, and see what\r\nuse I might make of it. At that time, please to remember, not the ghost\r\nof an idea entered my head that _you_ had stolen the Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere, I broke off in the reading of the letter for the second time.\r\n\r\nI had read those portions of the miserable woman\xe2\x80\x99s confession which\r\nrelated to myself, with unaffected surprise, and, I can honestly add,\r\nwith sincere distress. I had regretted, truly regretted, the aspersion\r\nwhich I had thoughtlessly cast on her memory, before I had seen a line\r\nof her letter. But when I had advanced as far as the passage which is\r\nquoted above, I own I felt my mind growing bitterer and bitterer\r\nagainst Rosanna Spearman as I went on. \xe2\x80\x9cRead the rest for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid, handing the letter to Betteredge across the table. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is\r\nanything in it that I _must_ look at, you can tell me as you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s natural, sir, in\r\n_you_. And, God help us all!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no less\r\nnatural in _her_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI proceed to copy the continuation of the letter from the original, in\r\nmy own possession:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving determined to keep the nightgown, and to see what use my love,\r\nor my revenge (I hardly know which) could turn it to in the future, the\r\nnext thing to discover was how to keep it without the risk of being\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was only one way\xe2\x80\x94to make another nightgown exactly like it,\r\nbefore Saturday came, and brought the laundry-woman and her inventory\r\nto the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid to put it off till next day (the Friday); being in doubt\r\nlest some accident might happen in the interval. I determined to make\r\nthe new nightgown on that same day (the Thursday), while I could count,\r\nif I played my cards properly, on having my time to myself. The first\r\nthing to do (after locking up your nightgown in my drawer) was to go\r\nback to your bedroom\xe2\x80\x94not so much to put it to rights (Penelope would\r\nhave done that for me, if I had asked her) as to find out whether you\r\nhad smeared off any of the paint-stain from your nightgown, on the bed,\r\nor on any piece of furniture in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI examined everything narrowly, and at last, I found a few streaks of\r\nthe paint on the inside of your dressing-gown\xe2\x80\x94not the linen\r\ndressing-gown you usually wore in that summer season, but a flannel\r\ndressing-gown which you had with you also. I suppose you felt chilly\r\nafter walking to and fro in nothing but your nightdress, and put on the\r\nwarmest thing you could find. At any rate, there were the stains, just\r\nvisible, on the inside of the dressing-gown. I easily got rid of these\r\nby scraping away the stuff of the flannel. This done, the only proof\r\nleft against you was the proof locked up in my drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had just finished your room when I was sent for to be questioned by\r\nMr. Seegrave, along with the rest of the servants. Next came the\r\nexamination of all our boxes. And then followed the most extraordinary\r\nevent of the day\xe2\x80\x94to _me_\xe2\x80\x94since I had found the paint on your nightgown.\r\nThis event came out of the second questioning of Penelope Betteredge by\r\nSuperintendent Seegrave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPenelope returned to us quite beside herself with rage at the manner\r\nin which Mr. Seegrave had treated her. He had hinted, beyond the\r\npossibility of mistaking him, that he suspected her of being the thief.\r\nWe were all equally astonished at hearing this, and we all asked, Why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Because the Diamond was in Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room,\xe2\x80\x9d Penelope\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd because I was the last person in the sitting-room at\r\nnight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost before the words had left her lips, I remembered that another\r\nperson had been in the sitting-room later than Penelope. That person\r\nwas yourself. My head whirled round, and my thoughts were in dreadful\r\nconfusion. In the midst of it all, something in my mind whispered to me\r\nthat the smear on your nightgown might have a meaning entirely\r\ndifferent to the meaning which I had given to it up to that time. \xe2\x80\x98If\r\nthe last person who was in the room is the person to be suspected,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nthought to myself, \xe2\x80\x98the thief is not Penelope, but Mr. Franklin Blake!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of any other gentleman, I believe I should have been\r\nashamed of suspecting him of theft, almost as soon as the suspicion had\r\npassed through my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the bare thought that _you_ had let yourself down to my level, and\r\nthat I, in possessing myself of your nightgown, had also possessed\r\nmyself of the means of shielding you from being discovered, and\r\ndisgraced for life\xe2\x80\x94I say, sir, the bare thought of this seemed to open\r\nsuch a chance before me of winning your good will, that I passed\r\nblindfold, as one may say, from suspecting to believing. I made up my\r\nmind, on the spot, that you had shown yourself the busiest of anybody\r\nin fetching the police, as a blind to deceive us all; and that the hand\r\nwhich had taken Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s jewel could by no possibility be any\r\nother hand than yours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe excitement of this new discovery of mine must, I think, have\r\nturned my head for a while. I felt such a devouring eagerness to see\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94to try you with a word or two about the Diamond, and to _make_ you\r\nlook at me, and speak to me, in that way\xe2\x80\x94that I put my hair tidy, and\r\nmade myself as nice as I could, and went to you boldly in the library\r\nwhere I knew you were writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had left one of your rings upstairs, which made as good an excuse\r\nfor my intrusion as I could have desired. But, oh, sir! if you have\r\never loved, you will understand how it was that all my courage cooled,\r\nwhen I walked into the room, and found myself in your presence. And\r\nthen, you looked up at me so coldly, and you thanked me for finding\r\nyour ring in such an indifferent manner, that my knees trembled under\r\nme, and I felt as if I should drop on the floor at your feet. When you\r\nhad thanked me, you looked back, if you remember, at your writing. I\r\nwas so mortified at being treated in this way, that I plucked up spirit\r\nenough to speak. I said, \xe2\x80\x98This is a strange thing about the Diamond,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99 And you looked up again, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, it is!\xe2\x80\x99 You spoke\r\ncivilly (I can\xe2\x80\x99t deny that); but still you kept a distance\xe2\x80\x94a cruel\r\ndistance between us. Believing, as I did, that you had got the lost\r\nDiamond hidden about you, while you were speaking, your coolness so\r\nprovoked me that I got bold enough, in the heat of the moment, to give\r\nyou a hint. I said, \xe2\x80\x98They will never find the Diamond, sir, will they?\r\nNo! nor the person who took it\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for that.\xe2\x80\x99 I nodded, and\r\nsmiled at you, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98I know!\xe2\x80\x99 _This_ time, you looked up\r\nat me with something like interest in your eyes; and I felt that a few\r\nmore words on your side and mine might bring out the truth. Just at\r\nthat moment, Mr. Betteredge spoilt it all by coming to the door. I knew\r\nhis footstep, and I also knew that it was against his rules for me to\r\nbe in the library at that time of day\xe2\x80\x94let alone being there along with\r\nyou. I had only just time to get out of my own accord, before he could\r\ncome in and tell me to go. I was angry and disappointed; but I was not\r\nentirely without hope for all that. The ice, you see, was broken\r\nbetween us\xe2\x80\x94and I thought I would take care, on the next occasion, that\r\nMr. Betteredge was out of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got back to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall, the bell was going for our\r\ndinner. Afternoon already! and the materials for making the new\r\nnightgown were still to be got! There was but one chance of getting\r\nthem. I shammed ill at dinner; and so secured the whole of the interval\r\nfrom then till tea-time to my own use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I was about, while the household believed me to be lying down in\r\nmy own room; and how I spent the night, after shamming ill again at\r\ntea-time, and having been sent up to bed, there is no need to tell you.\r\nSergeant Cuff discovered that much, if he discovered nothing more. And\r\nI can guess how. I was detected (though I kept my veil down) in the\r\ndraper\xe2\x80\x99s shop at Frizinghall. There was a glass in front of me, at the\r\ncounter where I was buying the longcloth; and\xe2\x80\x94in that glass\xe2\x80\x94I saw one\r\nof the shopmen point to my shoulder and whisper to another. At night\r\nagain, when I was secretly at work, locked into my room, I heard the\r\nbreathing of the women servants who suspected me, outside my door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter then; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now. On the Friday morning,\r\nhours before Sergeant Cuff entered the house, there was the new\r\nnightgown\xe2\x80\x94to make up your number in place of the nightgown that I had\r\ngot\xe2\x80\x94made, wrung out, dried, ironed, marked, and folded as the laundry\r\nwoman folded all the others, safe in your drawer. There was no fear (if\r\nthe linen in the house was examined) of the newness of the nightgown\r\nbetraying me. All your underclothing had been renewed, when you came to\r\nour house\xe2\x80\x94I suppose on your return home from foreign parts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing was the arrival of Sergeant Cuff; and the next great\r\nsurprise was the announcement of what _he_ thought about the smear on\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had believed you to be guilty (as I have owned), more because I\r\nwanted you to be guilty than for any other reason. And now, the\r\nSergeant had come round by a totally different way to the same\r\nconclusion (respecting the nightgown) as mine! And I had got the dress\r\nthat was the only proof against you! And not a living creature knew\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94yourself included! I am afraid to tell you how I felt when I called\r\nthese things to mind\xe2\x80\x94you would hate my memory for ever afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that place, Betteredge looked up from the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a glimmer of light so far, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, taking\r\noff his heavy tortoiseshell spectacles, and pushing Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfession a little away from him. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you come to any conclusion,\r\nsir, in your own mind, while I have been reading?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinish the letter first, Betteredge; there may be something to\r\nenlighten us at the end of it. I shall have a word or two to say to you\r\nafter that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just rest my eyes, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on again. In\r\nthe meantime, Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurry you\xe2\x80\x94but would you mind\r\ntelling me, in one word, whether you see your way out of this dreadful\r\nmess yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see my way back to London,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cto consult Mr. Bruff. If he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if the Sergeant won\xe2\x80\x99t leave his retirement at Dorking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Franklin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94as far as I can see now\xe2\x80\x94I am at the end of my\r\nresources. After Mr. Bruff and the Sergeant, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of a living\r\ncreature who can be of the slightest use to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the words passed my lips, some person outside knocked at the door of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nBetteredge looked surprised as well as annoyed by the interruption.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, irritably, \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and there entered to us, quietly, the most\r\nremarkable-looking man that I had ever seen. Judging him by his figure\r\nand his movements, he was still young. Judging him by his face, and\r\ncomparing him with Betteredge, he looked the elder of the two. His\r\ncomplexion was of a gipsy darkness; his fleshless cheeks had fallen\r\ninto deep hollows, over which the bone projected like a penthouse. His\r\nnose presented the fine shape and modelling so often found among the\r\nancient people of the East, so seldom visible among the newer races of\r\nthe West. His forehead rose high and straight from the brow. His marks\r\nand wrinkles were innumerable. From this strange face, eyes, stranger\r\nstill, of the softest brown\xe2\x80\x94eyes dreamy and mournful, and deeply sunk\r\nin their orbits\xe2\x80\x94looked out at you, and (in my case, at least) took your\r\nattention captive at their will. Add to this a quantity of thick\r\nclosely-curling hair, which, by some freak of Nature, had lost its\r\ncolour in the most startlingly partial and capricious manner. Over the\r\ntop of his head it was still of the deep black which was its natural\r\ncolour. Round the sides of his head\xe2\x80\x94without the slightest gradation of\r\ngrey to break the force of the extraordinary contrast\xe2\x80\x94it had turned\r\ncompletely white. The line between the two colours preserved no sort of\r\nregularity. At one place, the white hair ran up into the black; at\r\nanother, the black hair ran down into the white. I looked at the man\r\nwith a curiosity which, I am ashamed to say, I found it quite\r\nimpossible to control. His soft brown eyes looked back at me gently;\r\nand he met my involuntary rudeness in staring at him, with an apology\r\nwhich I was conscious that I had not deserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea that Mr. Betteredge was\r\nengaged.\xe2\x80\x9d He took a slip of paper from his pocket, and handed it to\r\nBetteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe list for next week,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. His eyes just rested on\r\nme again\xe2\x80\x94and he left the room as quietly as he had entered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s assistant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye, Mr. Franklin,\r\nyou will be sorry to hear that the little doctor has never recovered\r\nthat illness he caught, going home from the birthday dinner. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty well in health; but he lost his memory in the fever, and he has\r\nnever recovered more than the wreck of it since. The work all falls on\r\nhis assistant. Not much of it now, except among the poor. _They_ can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp themselves, you know. _They_ must put up with the man with the\r\npiebald hair, and the gipsy complexion\xe2\x80\x94or they would get no doctoring\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to like him, Betteredge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody likes him, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he so unpopular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Franklin, his appearance is against him, to begin with. And\r\nthen there\xe2\x80\x99s a story that Mr. Candy took him with a very doubtful\r\ncharacter. Nobody knows who he is\xe2\x80\x94and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a friend in the place.\r\nHow can you expect one to like him, after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible, of course! May I ask what he wanted with you, when\r\nhe gave you that bit of paper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to bring me the weekly list of the sick people about here, sir,\r\nwho stand in need of a little wine. My lady always had a regular\r\ndistribution of good sound port and sherry among the infirm poor; and\r\nMiss Rachel wishes the custom to be kept up. Times have changed! times\r\nhave changed! I remember when Mr. Candy himself brought the list to my\r\nmistress. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s assistant who brings the list to me.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go on with the letter, if you will allow me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBetteredge, drawing Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s confession back to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t lively reading, I grant you. But, there! it keeps me from getting\r\nsour with thinking of the past.\xe2\x80\x9d He put on his spectacles, and wagged\r\nhis head gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bottom of good sense, Mr. Franklin, in\r\nour conduct to our mothers, when they first start us on the journey of\r\nlife. We are all of us more or less unwilling to be brought into the\r\nworld. And we are all of us right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s assistant had produced too strong an impression on me to be\r\nimmediately dismissed from my thoughts. I passed over the last\r\nunanswerable utterance of the Betteredge philosophy; and returned to\r\nthe subject of the man with the piebald hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his name?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs ugly a name as need be,\xe2\x80\x9d Betteredge answered gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cEzra\r\nJennings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHaving told me the name of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, Betteredge appeared\r\nto think that we had wasted enough of our time on an insignificant\r\nsubject. He resumed the perusal of Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nOn my side, I sat at the window, waiting until he had done. Little by\r\nlittle, the impression produced on me by Ezra Jennings\xe2\x80\x94it seemed\r\nperfectly unaccountable, in such a situation as mine, that any human\r\nbeing should have produced an impression on me at all!\xe2\x80\x94faded from my\r\nmind. My thoughts flowed back into their former channel. Once more, I\r\nforced myself to look my own incredible position resolutely in the\r\nface. Once more, I reviewed in my own mind the course which I had at\r\nlast summoned composure enough to plan out for the future.\r\n\r\nTo go back to London that day; to put the whole case before Mr. Bruff;\r\nand, last and most important, to obtain (no matter by what means or at\r\nwhat sacrifice) a personal interview with Rachel\xe2\x80\x94this was my plan of\r\naction, so far as I was capable of forming it at the time. There was\r\nmore than an hour still to spare before the train started. And there\r\nwas the bare chance that Betteredge might discover something in the\r\nunread portion of Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s letter, which it might be useful\r\nfor me to know before I left the house in which the Diamond had been\r\nlost. For that chance I was now waiting.\r\n\r\nThe letter ended in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no need to be angry, Mr. Franklin, even if I did feel some\r\nlittle triumph at knowing that I held all your prospects in life in my\r\nown hands. Anxieties and fears soon came back to me. With the view\r\nSergeant Cuff took of the loss of the Diamond, he would be sure to end\r\nin examining our linen and our dresses. There was no place in my\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94there was no place in the house\xe2\x80\x94which I could feel satisfied would\r\nbe safe from him. How to hide the nightgown so that not even the\r\nSergeant could find it? and how to do that without losing one moment of\r\nprecious time?\xe2\x80\x94these were not easy questions to answer. My\r\nuncertainties ended in my taking a way that may make you laugh. I\r\nundressed, and put the nightgown on me. You had worn it\xe2\x80\x94and I had\r\nanother little moment of pleasure in wearing it after you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next news that reached us in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall showed that I had\r\nnot made sure of the nightgown a moment too soon. Sergeant Cuff wanted\r\nto see the washing-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found it, and took it to him in my lady\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room. The Sergeant\r\nand I had come across each other more than once in former days. I was\r\ncertain he would know me again\xe2\x80\x94and I was _not_ certain of what he might\r\ndo when he found me employed as servant in a house in which a valuable\r\njewel had been lost. In this suspense, I felt it would be a relief to\r\nme to get the meeting between us over, and to know the worst of it at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at me as if I was a stranger, when I handed him the\r\nwashing-book; and he was very specially polite in thanking me for\r\nbringing it. I thought those were both bad signs. There was no knowing\r\nwhat he might say of me behind my back; there was no knowing how soon I\r\nmight not find myself taken in custody on suspicion, and searched. It\r\nwas then time for your return from seeing Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite off by\r\nthe railway; and I went to your favourite walk in the shrubbery, to try\r\nfor another chance of speaking to you\xe2\x80\x94the last chance, for all I knew\r\nto the contrary, that I might have.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never appeared; and, what was worse still, Mr. Betteredge and\r\nSergeant Cuff passed by the place where I was hiding\xe2\x80\x94and the Sergeant\r\nsaw me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no choice, after that, but to return to my proper place and my\r\nproper work, before more disasters happened to me. Just as I was going\r\nto step across the path, you came back from the railway. You were\r\nmaking straight for the shrubbery, when you saw me\xe2\x80\x94I am certain, sir,\r\nyou saw me\xe2\x80\x94and you turned away as if I had got the plague, and went\r\ninto the house.*\r\n\r\n* NOTE; by Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x94The writer is entirely mistaken, poor\r\ncreature. I never noticed her. My intention was certainly to have taken\r\na turn in the shrubbery. But, remembering at the same moment that my\r\naunt might wish to see me, after my return from the railway, I altered\r\nmy mind, and went into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made the best of my way indoors again, returning by the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nentrance. There was nobody in the laundry-room at that time; and I sat\r\ndown there alone. I have told you already of the thoughts which the\r\nShivering Sand put into my head. Those thoughts came back to me now. I\r\nwondered in myself which it would be harder to do, if things went on in\r\nthis manner\xe2\x80\x94to bear Mr. Franklin Blake\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to me, or to jump\r\ninto the quicksand and end it for ever in that way?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s useless to ask me to account for my own conduct, at this time. I\r\ntry\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I stop you, when you avoided me in that cruel manner? Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t I call out, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Franklin, I have got something to say to you;\r\nit concerns yourself, and you must, and shall, hear it?\xe2\x80\x99 You were at my\r\nmercy\xe2\x80\x94I had got the whip-hand of you, as they say. And better than\r\nthat, I had the means (if I could only make you trust me) of being\r\nuseful to you in the future. Of course, I never supposed that you\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94had stolen the Diamond for the mere pleasure of stealing it.\r\nNo. Penelope had heard Miss Rachel, and I had heard Mr. Betteredge,\r\ntalk about your extravagance and your debts. It was plain enough to me\r\nthat you had taken the Diamond to sell it, or pledge it, and so to get\r\nthe money of which you stood in need. Well! I could have told you of a\r\nman in London who would have advanced a good large sum on the jewel,\r\nand who would have asked no awkward questions about it either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I speak to you! why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I speak to you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether the risks and difficulties of keeping the nightgown\r\nwere as much as I could manage, without having other risks and\r\ndifficulties added to them? This might have been the case with some\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94but how could it be the case with me? In the days when I was a\r\nthief, I had run fifty times greater risks, and found my way out of\r\ndifficulties to which _this_ difficulty was mere child\xe2\x80\x99s play. I had\r\nbeen apprenticed, as you may say, to frauds and deceptions\xe2\x80\x94some of them\r\non such a grand scale, and managed so cleverly, that they became\r\nfamous, and appeared in the newspapers. Was such a little thing as the\r\nkeeping of the nightgown likely to weigh on my spirits, and to set my\r\nheart sinking within me, at the time when I ought to have spoken to\r\nyou? What nonsense to ask the question! The thing couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the use of my dwelling in this way on my own folly? The plain\r\ntruth is plain enough, surely? Behind your back, I loved you with all\r\nmy heart and soul. Before your face\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying it\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nfrightened of you; frightened of making you angry with me; frightened\r\nof what you might say to me (though you _had_ taken the Diamond) if I\r\npresumed to tell you that I had found it out. I had gone as near to it\r\nas I dared when I spoke to you in the library. You had not turned your\r\nback on me then. You had not started away from me as if I had got the\r\nplague. I tried to provoke myself into feeling angry with you, and to\r\nrouse up my courage in that way. No! I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything but the\r\nmisery and the mortification of it. You\xe2\x80\x99re a plain girl; you have got a\r\ncrooked shoulder; you\xe2\x80\x99re only a housemaid\xe2\x80\x94what do you mean by\r\nattempting to speak to Me?\xe2\x80\x9d You never uttered a word of that, Mr.\r\nFranklin; but you said it all to me, nevertheless! Is such madness as\r\nthis to be accounted for? No. There is nothing to be done but to\r\nconfess it, and let it be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask your pardon, once more, for this wandering of my pen. There is\r\nno fear of its happening again. I am close at the end now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first person who disturbed me by coming into the empty room was\r\nPenelope. She had found out my secret long since, and she had done her\r\nbest to bring me to my senses\xe2\x80\x94and done it kindly too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I know why you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting here, and fretting, all by\r\nyourself. The best thing that can happen for your advantage, Rosanna,\r\nwill be for Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s visit here to come to an end. It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief\r\nthat he won\xe2\x80\x99t be long now before he leaves the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn all my thoughts of you I had never thought of your going away. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Penelope. I could only look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve just left Miss Rachel,\xe2\x80\x99 Penelope went on. \xe2\x80\x98And a hard matter I\r\nhave had of it to put up with her temper. She says the house is\r\nunbearable to her with the police in it; and she\xe2\x80\x99s determined to speak\r\nto my lady this evening, and to go to her Aunt Ablewhite tomorrow. If\r\nshe does that, Mr. Franklin will be the next to find a reason for going\r\naway, you may depend on it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recovered the use of my tongue at that. \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to say Mr.\r\nFranklin will go with her?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Only too gladly, if she would let him; but she won\xe2\x80\x99t. _He_ has been\r\nmade to feel her temper; _he_ is in her black books too\xe2\x80\x94and that after\r\nhaving done all he can to help her, poor fellow! No! no! If they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake it up before tomorrow, you will see Miss Rachel go one way, and\r\nMr. Franklin another. Where he may betake himself to I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. But\r\nhe will never stay here, Rosanna, after Miss Rachel has left us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI managed to master the despair I felt at the prospect of your going\r\naway. To own the truth, I saw a little glimpse of hope for myself if\r\nthere was really a serious disagreement between Miss Rachel and you.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know,\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, \xe2\x80\x98what the quarrel is between them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is all on Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s side,\xe2\x80\x99 Penelope said. \xe2\x80\x98And, for anything I\r\nknow to the contrary, it\xe2\x80\x99s all Miss Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s temper, and nothing else.\r\nI am loth to distress you, Rosanna; but don\xe2\x80\x99t run away with the notion\r\nthat Mr. Franklin is ever likely to quarrel with _her_. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\ndeal too fond of her for that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had only just spoken those cruel words when there came a call to\r\nus from Mr. Betteredge. All the indoor servants were to assemble in the\r\nhall. And then we were to go in, one by one, and be questioned in Mr.\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s room by Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to my turn to go in, after her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s maid and the upper\r\nhousemaid had been questioned first. Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nhe wrapped them up very cunningly\xe2\x80\x94soon showed me that those two women\r\n(the bitterest enemies I had in the house) had made their discoveries\r\noutside my door, on the Tuesday afternoon, and again on the Thursday\r\nnight. They had told the Sergeant enough to open his eyes to some part\r\nof the truth. He rightly believed me to have made a new nightgown\r\nsecretly, but he wrongly believed the paint-stained nightgown to be\r\nmine. I felt satisfied of another thing, from what he said, which it\r\npuzzled me to understand. He suspected me, of course, of being\r\nconcerned in the disappearance of the Diamond. But, at the same time,\r\nhe let me see\xe2\x80\x94purposely, as I thought\xe2\x80\x94that he did not consider me as\r\nthe person chiefly answerable for the loss of the jewel. He appeared to\r\nthink that I had been acting under the direction of somebody else. Who\r\nthat person might be, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess then, and can\xe2\x80\x99t guess now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this uncertainty, one thing was plain\xe2\x80\x94that Sergeant Cuff was miles\r\naway from knowing the whole truth. You were safe as long as the\r\nnightgown was safe\xe2\x80\x94and not a moment longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite despair of making you understand the distress and terror which\r\npressed upon me now. It was impossible for me to risk wearing your\r\nnightgown any longer. I might find myself taken off, at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnotice, to the police court at Frizinghall, to be charged on suspicion,\r\nand searched accordingly. While Sergeant Cuff still left me free, I had\r\nto choose\xe2\x80\x94and at once\xe2\x80\x94between destroying the nightgown, or hiding it in\r\nsome safe place, at some safe distance from the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only been a little less fond of you, I think I should have\r\ndestroyed it. But oh! how could I destroy the only thing I had which\r\nproved that I had saved you from discovery? If we did come to an\r\nexplanation together, and if you suspected me of having some bad\r\nmotive, and denied it all, how could I win upon you to trust me, unless\r\nI had the nightgown to produce? Was it wronging you to believe, as I\r\ndid and do still, that you might hesitate to let a poor girl like me be\r\nthe sharer of your secret, and your accomplice in the theft which your\r\nmoney-troubles had tempted you to commit? Think of your cold behaviour\r\nto me, sir, and you will hardly wonder at my unwillingness to destroy\r\nthe only claim on your confidence and your gratitude which it was my\r\nfortune to possess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI determined to hide it; and the place I fixed on was the place I knew\r\nbest\xe2\x80\x94the Shivering Sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the questioning was over, I made the first excuse that came\r\ninto my head, and got leave to go out for a breath of fresh air. I went\r\nstraight to Cobb\xe2\x80\x99s Hole, to Mr. Yolland\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. His wife and\r\ndaughter were the best friends I had. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I trusted them with\r\nyour secret\xe2\x80\x94I have trusted nobody. All I wanted was to write this\r\nletter to you, and to have a safe opportunity of taking the nightgown\r\noff me. Suspected as I was, I could do neither of those things with any\r\nsort of security, at the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I have nearly got through my long letter, writing it alone in\r\nLucy Yolland\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. When it is done, I shall go downstairs with the\r\nnightgown rolled up, and hidden under my cloak. I shall find the means\r\nI want for keeping it safe and dry in its hiding-place, among the\r\nlitter of old things in Mrs. Yolland\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen. And then I shall go to\r\nthe Shivering Sand\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of my letting my footmarks betray\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x94and hide the nightgown down in the sand, where no living creature\r\ncan find it without being first let into the secret by myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, when that\xe2\x80\x99s done, what then?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Mr. Franklin, I shall have two reasons for making another\r\nattempt to say the words to you which I have not said yet. If you leave\r\nthe house, as Penelope believes you will leave it, and if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspoken to you before that, I shall lose my opportunity forever. That is\r\none reason. Then, again, there is the comforting knowledge\xe2\x80\x94if my\r\nspeaking does make you angry\xe2\x80\x94that I have got the nightgown ready to\r\nplead my cause for me as nothing else can. That is my other reason. If\r\nthese two together don\xe2\x80\x99t harden my heart against the coldness which has\r\nhitherto frozen it up (I mean the coldness of your treatment of me),\r\nthere will be the end of my efforts\xe2\x80\x94and the end of my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. If I miss my next opportunity\xe2\x80\x94if you are as cruel as ever, and if\r\nI feel it again as I have felt it already\xe2\x80\x94good-bye to the world which\r\nhas grudged me the happiness that it gives to others. Good-bye to life,\r\nwhich nothing but a little kindness from _you_ can ever make\r\npleasurable to me again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself, sir, if it ends in this\r\nway. But try\xe2\x80\x94do try\xe2\x80\x94to feel some forgiving sorrow for me! I shall take\r\ncare that you find out what I have done for you, when I am past telling\r\nyou of it myself. Will you say something kind of me then\xe2\x80\x94in the same\r\ngentle way that you have when you speak to Miss Rachel? If you do that,\r\nand if there are such things as ghosts, I believe my ghost will hear\r\nit, and tremble with the pleasure of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time I left off. I am making myself cry. How am I to see my way\r\nto the hiding-place if I let these useless tears come and blind me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, why should I look at the gloomy side? Why not believe, while\r\nI can, that it will end well after all? I may find you in a good humour\r\ntonight\xe2\x80\x94or, if not, I may succeed better tomorrow morning. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimprove my plain face by fretting\xe2\x80\x94shall I? Who knows but I may have\r\nfilled all these weary long pages of paper for nothing? They will go,\r\nfor safety\xe2\x80\x99s sake (never mind now for what other reason) into the\r\nhiding-place along with the nightgown. It has been hard, hard work\r\nwriting my letter. Oh! if we only end in understanding each other, how\r\nI shall enjoy tearing it up!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to remain, sir, your true lover and humble servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cROSANNA SPEARMAN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reading of the letter was completed by Betteredge in silence. After\r\ncarefully putting it back in the envelope, he sat thinking, with his\r\nhead bowed down, and his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cis there any hint to guide me at the end of the\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up slowly, with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to guide you, Mr. Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\ntake my advice you will keep the letter in the cover till these present\r\nanxieties of yours have come to an end. It will sorely distress you,\r\nwhenever you read it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t read it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put the letter away in my pocket-book.\r\n\r\nA glance back at the sixteenth and seventeenth chapters of Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nNarrative will show that there really was a reason for my thus sparing\r\nmyself, at a time when my fortitude had been already cruelly tried.\r\nTwice over, the unhappy woman had made her last attempt to speak to me.\r\nAnd twice over, it had been my misfortune (God knows how innocently!)\r\nto repel the advances she had made to me. On the Friday night, as\r\nBetteredge truly describes it, she had found me alone at the\r\nbilliard-table. Her manner and language suggested to me and would have\r\nsuggested to any man, under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94that she was about to\r\nconfess a guilty knowledge of the disappearance of the Diamond. For her\r\nown sake, I had purposely shown no special interest in what was coming;\r\nfor her own sake, I had purposely looked at the billiard-balls, instead\r\nof looking at _her_\xe2\x80\x94and what had been the result? I had sent her away\r\nfrom me, wounded to the heart! On the Saturday again\xe2\x80\x94on the day when\r\nshe must have foreseen, after what Penelope had told her, that my\r\ndeparture was close at hand\xe2\x80\x94the same fatality still pursued us. She had\r\nonce more attempted to meet me in the shrubbery walk, and she had found\r\nme there in company with Betteredge and Sergeant Cuff. In her hearing,\r\nthe Sergeant, with his own underhand object in view, had appealed to my\r\ninterest in Rosanna Spearman. Again for the poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, I\r\nhad met the police-officer with a flat denial, and had declared\xe2\x80\x94loudly\r\ndeclared, so that she might hear _me_ too\xe2\x80\x94that I felt \xe2\x80\x9cno interest\r\nwhatever in Rosanna Spearman.\xe2\x80\x9d At those words, solely designed to warn\r\nher against attempting to gain my private ear, she had turned away and\r\nleft the place: cautioned of her danger, as I then believed;\r\nself-doomed to destruction, as I know now. From that point, I have\r\nalready traced the succession of events which led me to the astounding\r\ndiscovery at the quicksand. The retrospect is now complete. I may leave\r\nthe miserable story of Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x94to which, even at this distance\r\nof time, I cannot revert without a pang of distress\xe2\x80\x94to suggest for\r\nitself all that is here purposely left unsaid. I may pass from the\r\nsuicide at the Shivering Sand, with its strange and terrible influence\r\non my present position and future prospects, to interests which concern\r\nthe living people of this narrative, and to events which were already\r\npaving my way for the slow and toilsome journey from the darkness to\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nI walked to the railway station accompanied, it is needless to say, by\r\nGabriel Betteredge. I had the letter in my pocket, and the nightgown\r\nsafely packed in a little bag\xe2\x80\x94both to be submitted, before I slept that\r\nnight, to the investigation of Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\nWe left the house in silence. For the first time in my experience of\r\nhim, I found old Betteredge in my company without a word to say to me.\r\nHaving something to say on my side, I opened the conversation as soon\r\nas we were clear of the lodge gates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I go to London,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, \xe2\x80\x9cI have two questions to ask you.\r\nThey relate to myself, and I believe they will rather surprise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they will put that poor creature\xe2\x80\x99s letter out of my head, Mr.\r\nFranklin, they may do anything else they like with me. Please to begin\r\nsurprising me, sir, as soon as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first question, Betteredge, is this. Was I drunk on the night of\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s Birthday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ drunk!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s the great defect of\r\nyour character, Mr. Franklin that you only drink with your dinner, and\r\nnever touch a drop of liquor afterwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the birthday was a special occasion. I might have abandoned my\r\nregular habits, on that night of all others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did go out of your habits, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how.\r\nYou looked wretchedly ill\xe2\x80\x94and we persuaded you to have a drop of brandy\r\nand water to cheer you up a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not used to brandy and water. It is quite possible\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, Mr. Franklin. I knew you were not used, too. I poured you\r\nout half a wineglass-full of our fifty year old Cognac; and (more shame\r\nfor me!) I drowned that noble liquor in nigh on a tumbler-full of cold\r\nwater. A child couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got drunk on it\xe2\x80\x94let alone a grown man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew I could depend on his memory, in a matter of this kind. It was\r\nplainly impossible that I could have been intoxicated. I passed on to\r\nthe second question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I was sent abroad, Betteredge, you saw a great deal of me when\r\nI was a boy? Now tell me plainly, do you remember anything strange of\r\nme, after I had gone to bed at night? Did you ever discover me walking\r\nin my sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge stopped, looked at me for a moment, nodded his head, and\r\nwalked on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see your drift now, Mr. Franklin!\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re trying to account\r\nfor how you got the paint on your nightgown, without knowing it\r\nyourself. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do, sir. You\xe2\x80\x99re miles away still from getting at the\r\ntruth. Walk in your sleep? You never did such a thing in your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere again, I felt that Betteredge must be right. Neither at home nor\r\nabroad had my life ever been of the solitary sort. If I had been a\r\nsleep-walker, there were hundreds on hundreds of people who must have\r\ndiscovered me, and who, in the interest of my own safety, would have\r\nwarned me of the habit, and have taken precautions to restrain it.\r\n\r\nStill, admitting all this, I clung\xe2\x80\x94with an obstinacy which was surely\r\nnatural and excusable, under the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94to one or other of the\r\nonly two explanations that I could see which accounted for the\r\nunendurable position in which I then stood. Observing that I was not\r\nyet satisfied, Betteredge shrewdly adverted to certain later events in\r\nthe history of the Moonstone; and scattered both my theories to the\r\nwind at once and for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try it another way, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep your own opinion, and\r\nsee how far it will take you towards finding out the truth. If we are\r\nto believe the nightgown\xe2\x80\x94which I don\xe2\x80\x99t for one\xe2\x80\x94you not only smeared off\r\nthe paint from the door, without knowing it, but you also took the\r\nDiamond without knowing it. Is that right, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir. We\xe2\x80\x99ll say you were drunk, or walking in your sleep,\r\nwhen you took the jewel. That accounts for the night and morning, after\r\nthe birthday. But how does it account for what has happened since that\r\ntime? The Diamond has been taken to London, since that time. The\r\nDiamond has been pledged to Mr. Luker, since that time. Did you do\r\nthose two things, without knowing it, too? Were you drunk when I saw\r\nyou off in the pony-chaise on that Saturday evening? And did you walk\r\nin your sleep to Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s, when the train had brought you to your\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s end? Excuse me for saying it, Mr. Franklin, but this business\r\nhas so upset you, that you\xe2\x80\x99re not fit yet to judge for yourself. The\r\nsooner you lay your head alongside Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s head, the sooner you\r\nwill see your way out of the dead-lock that has got you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe reached the station, with only a minute or two to spare.\r\n\r\nI hurriedly gave Betteredge my address in London, so that he might\r\nwrite to me, if necessary; promising, on my side, to inform him of any\r\nnews which I might have to communicate. This done, and just as I was\r\nbidding him farewell, I happened to glance towards the\r\nbook-and-newspaper stall. There was Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable-looking\r\nassistant again, speaking to the keeper of the stall! Our eyes met at\r\nthe same moment. Ezra Jennings took off his hat to me. I returned the\r\nsalute, and got into a carriage just as the train started. It was a\r\nrelief to my mind, I suppose, to dwell on any subject which appeared to\r\nbe, personally, of no sort of importance to me. At all events, I began\r\nthe momentous journey back which was to take me to Mr. Bruff,\r\nwondering\xe2\x80\x94absurdly enough, I admit\xe2\x80\x94that I should have seen the man with\r\nthe piebald hair twice in one day!\r\n\r\nThe hour at which I arrived in London precluded all hope of my finding\r\nMr. Bruff at his place of business. I drove from the railway to his\r\nprivate residence at Hampstead, and disturbed the old lawyer dozing\r\nalone in his dining-room, with his favourite pug-dog on his lap, and\r\nhis bottle of wine at his elbow.\r\n\r\nI shall best describe the effect which my story produced on the mind of\r\nMr. Bruff by relating his proceedings when he had heard it to the end.\r\nHe ordered lights, and strong tea, to be taken into his study; and he\r\nsent a message to the ladies of his family, forbidding them to disturb\r\nus on any pretence whatever. These preliminaries disposed of, he first\r\nexamined the nightgown, and then devoted himself to the reading of\r\nRosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nThe reading completed, Mr. Bruff addressed me for the first time since\r\nwe had been shut up together in the seclusion of his own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFranklin Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a very serious\r\nmatter, in more respects than one. In my opinion, it concerns Rachel\r\nquite as nearly as it concerns you. Her extraordinary conduct is no\r\nmystery _now_. She believes you have stolen the Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had shrunk from reasoning my own way fairly to that revolting\r\nconclusion. But it had forced itself on me, nevertheless. My resolution\r\nto obtain a personal interview with Rachel, rested really and truly on\r\nthe ground just stated by Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first step to take in this investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer proceeded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis to appeal to Rachel. She has been silent all this time, from\r\nmotives which I (who know her character) can readily understand. It is\r\nimpossible, after what has happened, to submit to that silence any\r\nlonger. She must be persuaded to tell us, or she must be forced to tell\r\nus, on what grounds she bases her belief that you took the Moonstone.\r\nThe chances are, that the whole of this case, serious as it seems now,\r\nwill tumble to pieces, if we can only break through Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s inveterate\r\nreserve, and prevail upon her to speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very comforting opinion for _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI own I should\r\nlike to know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would like to know how I can justify it,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan tell you in two minutes. Understand, in the first place, that I\r\nlook at this matter from a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of\r\nevidence, with me. Very well. The evidence breaks down, at the outset,\r\non one important point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what point?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear. I admit that the mark of the name proves the nightgown\r\nto be yours. I admit that the mark of the paint proves the nightgown to\r\nhave made the smear on Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s door. But what evidence is there to\r\nprove that you are the person who wore it, on the night when the\r\nDiamond was lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe objection struck me, all the more forcibly that it reflected an\r\nobjection which I had felt myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to this,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the lawyer taking up Rosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfession, \xe2\x80\x9cI can understand that the letter is a distressing one to\r\n_you_. I can understand that you may hesitate to analyse it from a\r\npurely impartial point of view. But _I_ am not in your position. I can\r\nbring my professional experience to bear on this document, just as I\r\nshould bring it to bear on any other. Without alluding to the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncareer as a thief, I will merely remark that her letter proves her to\r\nhave been an adept at deception, on her own showing; and I argue from\r\nthat, that I am justified in suspecting her of not having told the\r\nwhole truth. I won\xe2\x80\x99t start any theory, at present, as to what she may\r\nor may not have done. I will only say that, if Rachel has suspected you\r\n_on the evidence of the nightgown only_, the chances are ninety-nine to\r\na hundred that Rosanna Spearman was the person who showed it to her. In\r\nthat case, there is the woman\xe2\x80\x99s letter, confessing that she was jealous\r\nof Rachel, confessing that she changed the roses, confessing that she\r\nsaw a glimpse of hope for herself, in the prospect of a quarrel between\r\nRachel and you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to ask who took the Moonstone (as a means\r\nto her end, Rosanna Spearman would have taken fifty Moonstones)\xe2\x80\x94I only\r\nsay that the disappearance of the jewel gave this reclaimed thief who\r\nwas in love with you, an opportunity of setting you and Rachel at\r\nvariance for the rest of your lives. She had not decided on destroying\r\nherself, _then_, remember; and, having the opportunity, I distinctly\r\nassert that it was in her character, and in her position at the time,\r\nto take it. What do you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome such suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9ccrossed my own mind, as soon as I\r\nopened the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly! And when you had read the letter, you pitied the poor\r\ncreature, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it in your heart to suspect her. Does you\r\ncredit, my dear sir\xe2\x80\x94does you credit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose it turns out that I did wear the nightgown? What then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how the fact can be proved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cBut assuming\r\nthe proof to be possible, the vindication of your innocence would be no\r\neasy matter. We won\xe2\x80\x99t go into that, now. Let us wait and see whether\r\nRachel hasn\xe2\x80\x99t suspected you on the evidence of the nightgown only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God, how coolly you talk of Rachel suspecting me!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right has she to suspect Me, on any evidence, of being a thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very sensible question, my dear sir. Rather hotly put\xe2\x80\x94but well worth\r\nconsidering for all that. What puzzles you, puzzles me too. Search your\r\nmemory, and tell me this. Did anything happen while you were staying at\r\nthe house\xe2\x80\x94not, of course, to shake Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s belief in your honour\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\nlet us say, to shake her belief (no matter with how little reason) in\r\nyour principles generally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI started, in ungovernable agitation, to my feet. The lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s question\r\nreminded me, for the first time since I had left England, that\r\nsomething _had_ happened.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth chapter of Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s Narrative, an allusion will be\r\nfound to the arrival of a foreigner and a stranger at my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nwho came to see me on business. The nature of his business was this.\r\n\r\nI had been foolish enough (being, as usual, straitened for money at the\r\ntime) to accept a loan from the keeper of a small restaurant in Paris,\r\nto whom I was well known as a customer. A time was settled between us\r\nfor paying the money back; and when the time came, I found it (as\r\nthousands of other honest men have found it) impossible to keep my\r\nengagement. I sent the man a bill. My name was unfortunately too well\r\nknown on such documents: he failed to negotiate it. His affairs had\r\nfallen into disorder, in the interval since I had borrowed of him;\r\nbankruptcy stared him in the face; and a relative of his, a French\r\nlawyer, came to England to find me, and to insist upon the payment of\r\nmy debt. He was a man of violent temper; and he took the wrong way with\r\nme. High words passed on both sides; and my aunt and Rachel were\r\nunfortunately in the next room, and heard us. Lady Verinder came in,\r\nand insisted on knowing what was the matter. The Frenchman produced his\r\ncredentials, and declared me to be responsible for the ruin of a poor\r\nman, who had trusted in my honour. My aunt instantly paid him the\r\nmoney, and sent him off. She knew me better of course than to take the\r\nFrenchman\xe2\x80\x99s view of the transaction. But she was shocked at my\r\ncarelessness, and justly angry with me for placing myself in a\r\nposition, which, but for her interference, might have become a very\r\ndisgraceful one. Either her mother told her, or Rachel heard what\r\npassed\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t say which. She took her own romantic, high-flown view of\r\nthe matter. I was \xe2\x80\x9cheartless\xe2\x80\x9d; I was \xe2\x80\x9cdishonourable\xe2\x80\x9d; I had \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nprinciple\xe2\x80\x9d; there was \xe2\x80\x9cno knowing what I might do next\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in short, she\r\nsaid some of the severest things to me which I had ever heard from a\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s lips. The breach between us lasted for the whole of the\r\nnext day. The day after, I succeeded in making my peace, and thought no\r\nmore of it. Had Rachel reverted to this unlucky accident, at the\r\ncritical moment when my place in her estimation was again, and far more\r\nseriously, assailed? Mr. Bruff, when I had mentioned the circumstances\r\nto him, answered the question at once in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have its effect on her mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish,\r\nfor your sake, the thing had not happened. However, we have discovered\r\nthat there _was_ a predisposing influence against you\xe2\x80\x94and there is one\r\nuncertainty cleared out of our way, at any rate. I see nothing more\r\nthat we can do now. Our next step in this inquiry must be the step that\r\ntakes us to Rachel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, and began walking thoughtfully up and down the room. Twice, I\r\nwas on the point of telling him that I had determined on seeing Rachel\r\npersonally; and twice, having regard to his age and his character, I\r\nhesitated to take him by surprise at an unfavourable moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe grand difficulty is,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9chow to make her show her whole\r\nmind in this matter, without reserve. Have you any suggestions to\r\noffer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made up my mind, Mr. Bruff, to speak to Rachel myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d He suddenly stopped in his walk, and looked at me as if he\r\nthought I had taken leave of my senses. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, of all the people in the\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d He abruptly checked himself, and took another turn in the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn cases of this extraordinary kind, the\r\nrash way is sometimes the best way.\xe2\x80\x9d He considered the question for a\r\nmoment or two, under that new light, and ended boldly by a decision in\r\nmy favour. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing venture, nothing have,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman resumed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a chance in your favour which I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess\xe2\x80\x94and you shall\r\nbe the first to try the experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA chance in my favour?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, in the greatest surprise.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s face softened, for the first time, into a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is how it stands,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you fairly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust\r\nyour discretion, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust your temper. But I do trust in\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s still preserving, in some remote little corner of her heart, a\r\ncertain perverse weakness for _you_. Touch that\xe2\x80\x94and trust to the\r\nconsequences for the fullest disclosures that can flow from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips! The question is\xe2\x80\x94how are you to see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been a guest of yours at this house,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I\r\nventure to suggest\xe2\x80\x94if nothing was said about me beforehand\xe2\x80\x94that I might\r\nsee her here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. With that one word of comment on the reply that\r\nI had made to him, he took another turn up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plain English,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy house is to be turned into a trap to\r\ncatch Rachel; with a bait to tempt her, in the shape of an invitation\r\nfrom my wife and daughters. If you were anybody else but Franklin\r\nBlake, and if this matter was one atom less serious than it really is,\r\nI should refuse point-blank. As things are, I firmly believe Rachel\r\nwill live to thank me for turning traitor to her in my old age.\r\nConsider me your accomplice. Rachel shall be asked to spend the day\r\nhere; and you shall receive due notice of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen? Tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow won\xe2\x80\x99t give us time enough to get her answer. Say the day\r\nafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I hear from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay at home all the morning and expect me to call on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him for the inestimable assistance which he was rendering to\r\nme, with the gratitude that I really felt; and, declining a hospitable\r\ninvitation to sleep that night at Hampstead, returned to my lodgings in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nOf the day that followed, I have only to say that it was the longest\r\nday of my life. Innocent as I knew myself to be, certain as I was that\r\nthe abominable imputation which rested on me must sooner or later be\r\ncleared off, there was nevertheless a sense of self-abasement in my\r\nmind which instinctively disinclined me to see any of my friends. We\r\noften hear (almost invariably, however, from superficial observers)\r\nthat guilt can look like innocence. I believe it to be infinitely the\r\ntruer axiom of the two that innocence can look like guilt. I caused\r\nmyself to be denied all day, to every visitor who called; and I only\r\nventured out under cover of the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Mr. Bruff surprised me at the breakfast-table. He\r\nhanded me a large key, and announced that he felt ashamed of himself\r\nfor the first time in his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is coming today, to lunch and spend the afternoon with my wife and\r\nmy girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre Mrs. Bruff, and your daughters, in the secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInevitably. But women, as you may have observed, have no principles.\r\nMy family don\xe2\x80\x99t feel my pangs of conscience. The end being to bring you\r\nand Rachel together again, my wife and daughters pass over the means\r\nemployed to gain it, as composedly as if they were Jesuits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am infinitely obliged to them. What is this key?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key of the gate in my back-garden wall. Be there at three this\r\nafternoon. Let yourself into the garden, and make your way in by the\r\nconservatory door. Cross the small drawing-room, and open the door in\r\nfront of you which leads into the music-room. There, you will find\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x94and find her, alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you how. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame _me_ for what happens afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, he went out.\r\n\r\nI had many weary hours still to wait through. To while away the time, I\r\nlooked at my letters. Among them was a letter from Betteredge.\r\n\r\nI opened it eagerly. To my surprise and disappointment, it began with\r\nan apology warning me to expect no news of any importance. In the next\r\nsentence the everlasting Ezra Jennings appeared again! He had stopped\r\nBetteredge on the way out of the station, and had asked who I was.\r\nInformed on this point, he had mentioned having seen me to his master\r\nMr. Candy. Mr. Candy hearing of this, had himself driven over to\r\nBetteredge, to express his regret at our having missed each other. He\r\nhad a reason for wishing particularly to speak to me; and when I was\r\nnext in the neighbourhood of Frizinghall, he begged I would let him\r\nknow. Apart from a few characteristic utterances of the Betteredge\r\nphilosophy, this was the sum and substance of my correspondent\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. The warm-hearted, faithful old man acknowledged that he had\r\nwritten \xe2\x80\x9cmainly for the pleasure of writing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI crumpled up the letter in my pocket, and forgot it the moment after,\r\nin the all-absorbing interest of my coming interview with Rachel.\r\n\r\nAs the clock of Hampstead church struck three, I put Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s key\r\ninto the lock of the door in the wall. When I first stepped into the\r\ngarden, and while I was securing the door again on the inner side, I\r\nown to having felt a certain guilty doubtfulness about what might\r\nhappen next. I looked furtively on either side of me; suspicious of the\r\npresence of some unexpected witness in some unknown corner of the\r\ngarden. Nothing appeared, to justify my apprehensions. The walks were,\r\none and all, solitudes; and the birds and the bees were the only\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nI passed through the garden; entered the conservatory; and crossed the\r\nsmall drawing-room. As I laid my hand on the door opposite, I heard a\r\nfew plaintive chords struck on the piano in the room within. She had\r\noften idled over the instrument in this way, when I was staying at her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s house. I was obliged to wait a little, to steady myself. The\r\npast and present rose side by side, at that supreme moment\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\ncontrast shook me.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a minute, I roused my manhood, and opened the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I showed myself in the doorway, Rachel rose from the\r\npiano.\r\n\r\nI closed the door behind me. We confronted each other in silence, with\r\nthe full length of the room between us. The movement she had made in\r\nrising appeared to be the one exertion of which she was capable. All\r\nuse of every other faculty, bodily or mental, seemed to be merged in\r\nthe mere act of looking at me.\r\n\r\nA fear crossed my mind that I had shown myself too suddenly. I advanced\r\na few steps towards her. I said gently, \xe2\x80\x9cRachel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of my voice brought the life back to her limbs, and the\r\ncolour to her face. She advanced, on her side, still without speaking.\r\nSlowly, as if acting under some influence independent of her own will,\r\nshe came nearer and nearer to me; the warm dusky colour flushing her\r\ncheeks, the light of reviving intelligence brightening every instant in\r\nher eyes. I forgot the object that had brought me into her presence; I\r\nforgot the vile suspicion that rested on my good name; I forgot every\r\nconsideration, past, present, and future, which I was bound to\r\nremember. I saw nothing but the woman I loved coming nearer and nearer\r\nto me. She trembled; she stood irresolute. I could resist it no\r\nlonger\xe2\x80\x94I caught her in my arms, and covered her face with kisses.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment when I thought the kisses were returned; a moment\r\nwhen it seemed as if she, too might have forgotten. Almost before the\r\nidea could shape itself in my mind, her first voluntary action made me\r\nfeel that she remembered. With a cry which was like a cry of\r\nhorror\xe2\x80\x94with a strength which I doubt if I could have resisted if I had\r\ntried\xe2\x80\x94she thrust me back from her. I saw merciless anger in her eyes; I\r\nsaw merciless contempt on her lips. She looked me over, from head to\r\nfoot, as she might have looked at a stranger who had insulted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou coward!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, miserable, heartless coward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were her first words! The most unendurable reproach that a woman\r\ncan address to a man, was the reproach that she picked out to address\r\nto Me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember the time, Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you could have told me\r\nthat I had offended you, in a worthier way than that. I beg your\r\npardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething of the bitterness that I felt may have communicated itself to\r\nmy voice. At the first words of my reply, her eyes, which had been\r\nturned away the moment before, looked back at me unwillingly. She\r\nanswered in a low tone, with a sullen submission of manner which was\r\nquite new in my experience of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there is some excuse for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter what you have\r\ndone, is it a manly action, on your part, to find your way to me as you\r\nhave found it today? It seems a cowardly experiment, to try an\r\nexperiment on my weakness for you. It seems a cowardly surprise, to\r\nsurprise me into letting you kiss me. But that is only a woman\xe2\x80\x99s view.\r\nI ought to have known it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be your view. I should have done\r\nbetter if I had controlled myself, and said nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe apology was more unendurable than the insult. The most degraded man\r\nliving would have felt humiliated by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my honour was not in your hands,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would leave you this\r\ninstant, and never see you again. You have spoken of what I have done.\r\nWhat have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done! _You_ ask that question of _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have kept your infamy a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have suffered\r\nthe consequences of concealing it. Have I no claim to be spared the\r\ninsult of your asking me what you have done? Is _all_ sense of\r\ngratitude dead in you? You were once a gentleman. You were once dear to\r\nmy mother, and dearer still to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice failed her. She dropped into a chair, and turned her back on\r\nme, and covered her face with her hands.\r\n\r\nI waited a little before I trusted myself to say any more. In that\r\nmoment of silence, I hardly know which I felt most keenly\xe2\x80\x94the sting\r\nwhich her contempt had planted in me, or the proud resolution which\r\nshut me out from all community with her distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will not speak first,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must. I have come here with\r\nsomething serious to say to you. Will you do me the common justice of\r\nlistening while I say it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe neither moved, nor answered. I made no second appeal to her; I\r\nnever advanced an inch nearer to her chair. With a pride which was as\r\nobstinate as her pride, I told her of my discovery at the Shivering\r\nSand, and of all that had led to it. The narrative, of necessity,\r\noccupied some little time. From beginning to end, she never looked\r\nround at me, and she never uttered a word.\r\n\r\nI kept my temper. My whole future depended, in all probability, on my\r\nnot losing possession of myself at that moment. The time had come to\r\nput Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s theory to the test. In the breathless interest of\r\ntrying that experiment, I moved round so as to place myself in front of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a question to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt obliges me to refer again\r\nto a painful subject. Did Rosanna Spearman show you the nightgown. Yes,\r\nor No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet; and walked close up to me of her own accord.\r\nHer eyes looked me searchingly in the face, as if to read something\r\nthere which they had never read yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nI still restrained myself. I said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cRachel, will you answer my\r\nquestion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on, without heeding me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you some object to gain which I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand? Some mean fear\r\nabout the future, in which I am concerned? They say your father\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nhas made you a rich man. Have you come here to compensate me for the\r\nloss of my Diamond? And have you heart enough left to feel ashamed of\r\nyour errand? Is _that_ the secret of your pretence of innocence, and\r\nyour story about Rosanna Spearman? Is there a motive of shame at the\r\nbottom of all the falsehood, this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped her there. I could control myself no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done me an infamous wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke out hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou suspect\r\nme of stealing your Diamond. I have a right to know, and I _will_ know,\r\nthe reason why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspect you!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, her anger rising with mine. \xe2\x80\x9c_You\r\nvillain, I saw you take the Diamond with my own eyes!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe revelation which burst upon me in those words, the overthrow which\r\nthey instantly accomplished of the whole view of the case on which Mr.\r\nBruff had relied, struck me helpless. Innocent as I was, I stood before\r\nher in silence. To her eyes, to any eyes, I must have looked like a man\r\noverwhelmed by the discovery of his own guilt.\r\n\r\nShe drew back from the spectacle of my humiliation and of her triumph.\r\nThe sudden silence that had fallen upon me seemed to frighten her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nspared you, at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have spared you now, if\r\nyou had not forced me to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d She moved away as if to leave the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94and hesitated before she got to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come here\r\nto humiliate yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come here to humiliate\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d She went on a few steps, and paused once more. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nsay something!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have any mercy\r\nleft, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me degrade myself in this way! Say something\xe2\x80\x94and drive\r\nme out of the room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI advanced towards her, hardly conscious of what I was doing. I had\r\npossibly some confused idea of detaining her until she had told me\r\nmore. From the moment when I knew that the evidence on which I stood\r\ncondemned in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s mind, was the evidence of her own eyes,\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94not even my conviction of my own innocence\xe2\x80\x94was clear to my\r\nmind. I took her by the hand; I tried to speak firmly and to the\r\npurpose. All I could say was, \xe2\x80\x9cRachel, you once loved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and looked away from me. Her hand lay powerless and\r\ntrembling in mine. \xe2\x80\x9cLet go of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said faintly.\r\n\r\nMy touch seemed to have the same effect on her which the sound of my\r\nvoice had produced when I first entered the room. After she had said\r\nthe word which called me a coward, after she had made the avowal which\r\nbranded me as a thief\xe2\x80\x94while her hand lay in mine I was her master\r\nstill!\r\n\r\nI drew her gently back into the middle of the room. I seated her by the\r\nside of me. \xe2\x80\x9cRachel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain the contradiction in\r\nwhat I am going to tell you. I can only speak the truth as you have\r\nspoken it. You saw me\xe2\x80\x94with your own eyes, you saw me take the Diamond.\r\nBefore God who hears us, I declare that I now know I took it for the\r\nfirst time! Do you doubt me still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had neither heeded nor heard me. \xe2\x80\x9cLet go of my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated\r\nfaintly. That was her only answer. Her head sank on my shoulder; and\r\nher hand unconsciously closed on mine, at the moment when she asked me\r\nto release it.\r\n\r\nI refrained from pressing the question. But there my forbearance\r\nstopped. My chance of ever holding up my head again among honest men\r\ndepended on my chance of inducing her to make her disclosure complete.\r\nThe one hope left for me was the hope that she might have overlooked\r\nsomething in the chain of evidence\xe2\x80\x94some mere trifle, perhaps, which\r\nmight nevertheless, under careful investigation, be made the means of\r\nvindicating my innocence in the end. I own I kept possession of her\r\nhand. I own I spoke to her with all that I could summon back of the\r\nsympathy and confidence of the bygone time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask you something,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to tell me\r\neverything that happened, from the time when we wished each other\r\ngood-night, to the time when you saw me take the Diamond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head from my shoulder, and made an effort to release her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, why go back to it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy go back to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you why, Rachel. You are the victim, and I am the victim,\r\nof some monstrous delusion which has worn the mask of truth. If we look\r\nat what happened on the night of your birthday together, we may end in\r\nunderstanding each other yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer head dropped back on my shoulder. The tears gathered in her eyes,\r\nand fell slowly over her cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chave _I_ never had\r\nthat hope? Have _I_ not tried to see it, as you are trying now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have tried by yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not tried with me\r\nto help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words seemed to awaken in her something of the hope which I felt\r\nmyself when I uttered them. She replied to my questions with more than\r\ndocility\xe2\x80\x94she exerted her intelligence; she willingly opened her whole\r\nmind to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us begin,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith what happened after we had wished each\r\nother good-night. Did you go to bed? or did you sit up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice the time? Was it late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very. About twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you fall asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were restless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer almost unmanned me. Something in the tone, even more than in\r\nthe words, went straight to my heart. It was only after pausing a\r\nlittle first that I was able to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you any light in your room?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone\xe2\x80\x94until I got up again, and lit my candle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long was that, after you had gone to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout an hour after, I think. About one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you leave your bedroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to leave it. I had put on my dressing-gown; and I was\r\ngoing into my sitting-room to get a book\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you opened your bedroom door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had just opened it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had not gone into the sitting-room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I was stopped from going into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat stopped you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw a light, under the door; and I heard footsteps approaching it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot then. I knew my poor mother was a bad sleeper; and I remembered\r\nthat she had tried hard, that evening, to persuade me to let her take\r\ncharge of my Diamond. She was unreasonably anxious about it, as I\r\nthought; and I fancied she was coming to me to see if I was in bed, and\r\nto speak to me about the Diamond again, if she found that I was up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI blew out my candle, so that she might think I was in bed. I was\r\nunreasonable, on my side\xe2\x80\x94I was determined to keep my Diamond in the\r\nplace of my own choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter blowing out the candle, did you go back to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no time to go back. At the moment when I blew the candle out,\r\nthe sitting-room door opened, and I saw\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDressed as usual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my nightgown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your nightgown\xe2\x80\x94with your bedroom candle in your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you see my face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlainly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite plainly. The candle in your hand showed it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere my eyes open?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice anything strange in them? Anything like a fixed, vacant\r\nexpression?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort. Your eyes were bright\xe2\x80\x94brighter than usual. You\r\nlooked about in the room, as if you knew you were where you ought not\r\nto be, and as if you were afraid of being found out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you observe one thing when I came into the room\xe2\x80\x94did you observe\r\nhow I walked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou walked as you always do. You came in as far as the middle of the\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94and then you stopped and looked about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do, on first seeing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could do nothing. I was petrified. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call\r\nout, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even move to shut my door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I see you, where you stood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might certainly have seen me. But you never looked towards me.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s useless to ask the question. I am sure you never saw me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have taken the Diamond? would you have acted as you did\r\nafterwards? would you be here now\xe2\x80\x94if you had seen that I was awake and\r\nlooking at you? Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me talk of that part of it! I want to answer\r\nyou quietly. Help me to keep as calm as I can. Go on to something\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was right\xe2\x80\x94in every way, right. I went on to other things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I do, after I had got to the middle of the room, and had\r\nstopped there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou turned away, and went straight to the corner near the window\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nmy Indian cabinet stands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was at the cabinet, my back must have been turned towards you.\r\nHow did you see what I was doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you moved, I moved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo as to see what I was about with my hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are three glasses in my sitting-room. As you stood there, I saw\r\nall that you did, reflected in one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou put your candle on the top of the cabinet. You opened, and shut,\r\none drawer after another, until you came to the drawer in which I had\r\nput my Diamond. You looked at the open drawer for a moment. And then\r\nyou put your hand in, and took the Diamond out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I took the Diamond out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw your hand go into the drawer. And I saw the gleam of the stone\r\nbetween your finger and thumb, when you took your hand out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid my hand approach the drawer again\xe2\x80\x94to close it, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You had the Diamond in your right hand; and you took the candle\r\nfrom the top of the cabinet with your left hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I look about me again, after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I leave the room immediately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You stood quite still, for what seemed a long time. I saw your\r\nface sideways in the glass. You looked like a man thinking, and\r\ndissatisfied with his own thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou roused yourself on a sudden, and you went straight out of the\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I close the door after me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You passed out quickly into the passage, and left the door open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, your light disappeared, and the sound of your steps died away,\r\nand I was left alone in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid nothing happen\xe2\x80\x94from that time, to the time when the whole house\r\nknew that the Diamond was lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of that? Might you not have been asleep a part of the\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never slept. I never went back to my bed. Nothing happened until\r\nPenelope came in, at the usual time in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dropped her hand, and rose, and took a turn in the room. Every\r\nquestion that I could put had been answered. Every detail that I could\r\ndesire to know had been placed before me. I had even reverted to the\r\nidea of sleep-walking, and the idea of intoxication; and, again, the\r\nworthlessness of the one theory and the other had been proved\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nauthority, this time, of the witness who had seen me. What was to be\r\nsaid next? what was to be done next? There rose the horrible fact of\r\nthe Theft\xe2\x80\x94the one visible, tangible object that confronted me, in the\r\nmidst of the impenetrable darkness which enveloped all besides! Not a\r\nglimpse of light to guide me, when I had possessed myself of Rosanna\r\nSpearman\xe2\x80\x99s secret at the Shivering Sand. And not a glimpse of light\r\nnow, when I had appealed to Rachel herself, and had heard the hateful\r\nstory of the night from her own lips.\r\n\r\nShe was the first, this time, to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have asked, and I have answered. You have made\r\nme hope something from all this, because _you_ hoped something from it.\r\nWhat have you to say now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which she spoke warned me that my influence over her was a\r\nlost influence once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were to look at what happened on my birthday night, together,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on; \xe2\x80\x9cand we were then to understand each other. Have we done\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited pitilessly for my reply. In answering her I committed a\r\nfatal error\xe2\x80\x94I let the exasperating helplessness of my situation get the\r\nbetter of my self-control. Rashly and uselessly, I reproached her for\r\nthe silence which had kept me until that moment in ignorance of the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had spoken when you ought to have spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d I began; \xe2\x80\x9cif you had\r\ndone me the common justice to explain yourself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke in on me with a cry of fury. The few words I had said seemed\r\nto have lashed her on the instant into a frenzy of rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain myself!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! is there another man like this in\r\nthe world? I spare him, when my heart is breaking; I screen him when my\r\nown character is at stake; and _he_\xe2\x80\x94of all human beings, _he_\xe2\x80\x94turns on\r\nme now, and tells me that I ought to have explained myself! After\r\nbelieving in him as I did, after loving him as I did, after thinking of\r\nhim by day, and dreaming of him by night\xe2\x80\x94he wonders I didn\xe2\x80\x99t charge him\r\nwith his disgrace the first time we met: \xe2\x80\x98My heart\xe2\x80\x99s darling, you are a\r\nThief! My hero whom I love and honour, you have crept into my room\r\nunder cover of the night, and stolen my Diamond!\xe2\x80\x99 That is what I ought\r\nto have said. You villain, you mean, mean, mean villain, I would have\r\nlost fifty diamonds, rather than see your face lying to me, as I see it\r\nlying now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took up my hat. In mercy to _her_\xe2\x80\x94yes! I can honestly say it\xe2\x80\x94in mercy\r\nto _her_, I turned away without a word, and opened the door by which I\r\nhad entered the room.\r\n\r\nShe followed, and snatched the door out of my hand; she closed it, and\r\npointed back to the place that I had left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet! It seems that _I_ owe a justification of my\r\nconduct to _you_. You shall stay and hear it. Or you shall stoop to the\r\nlowest infamy of all, and force your way out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt wrung my heart to see her; it wrung my heart to hear her. I answered\r\nby a sign\xe2\x80\x94it was all I could do\xe2\x80\x94that I submitted myself to her will.\r\n\r\nThe crimson flush of anger began to fade out of her face, as I went\r\nback, and took my chair in silence. She waited a little, and steadied\r\nherself. When she went on, but one sign of feeling was discernible in\r\nher. She spoke without looking at me. Her hands were fast clasped in\r\nher lap, and her eyes were fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have done you the common justice to explain myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, repeating my own words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see whether I did try to do\r\nyou justice, or not. I told you just now that I never slept, and never\r\nreturned to my bed, after you had left my sitting-room. It\xe2\x80\x99s useless to\r\ntrouble you by dwelling on what I thought\xe2\x80\x94you would not understand my\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94I will only tell you what I did, when time enough had passed\r\nto help me to recover myself. I refrained from alarming the house, and\r\ntelling everybody what had happened\xe2\x80\x94as I ought to have done. In spite\r\nof what I had seen, I was fond enough of you to believe\xe2\x80\x94no matter\r\nwhat!\xe2\x80\x94any impossibility, rather than admit it to my own mind that you\r\nwere deliberately a thief. I thought and thought\xe2\x80\x94and I ended in writing\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never received the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you never received it. Wait a little, and you shall hear why.\r\nMy letter would have told you nothing openly. It would not have ruined\r\nyou for life, if it had fallen into some other person\xe2\x80\x99s hands. It would\r\nonly have said\xe2\x80\x94in a manner which you yourself could not possibly have\r\nmistaken\xe2\x80\x94that I had reason to know you were in debt, and that it was in\r\nmy experience and in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s experience of you, that you were not\r\nvery discreet, or very scrupulous about how you got money when you\r\nwanted it. You would have remembered the visit of the French lawyer,\r\nand you would have known what I referred to. If you had read on with\r\nsome interest after that, you would have come to an offer I had to make\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x94the offer, privately (not a word, mind, to be said openly about\r\nit between us!), of the loan of as large a sum of money as I could\r\nget.\xe2\x80\x94And I would have got it!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, her colour beginning to\r\nrise again, and her eyes looking up at me once more. \xe2\x80\x9cI would have\r\npledged the Diamond myself, if I could have got the money in no other\r\nway! In those words I wrote to you. Wait! I did more than that. I\r\narranged with Penelope to give you the letter when nobody was near. I\r\nplanned to shut myself into my bedroom, and to have the sitting-room\r\nleft open and empty all the morning. And I hoped\xe2\x80\x94with all my heart and\r\nsoul I hoped!\xe2\x80\x94that you would take the opportunity, and put the Diamond\r\nback secretly in the drawer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI attempted to speak. She lifted her hand impatiently, and stopped me.\r\nIn the rapid alternations of her temper, her anger was beginning to\r\nrise again. She got up from her chair, and approached me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you are going to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to\r\nremind me again that you never received my letter. I can tell you why.\r\nI tore it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what reason?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the best of reasons. I preferred tearing it up to throwing it away\r\nupon such a man as you! What was the first news that reached me in the\r\nmorning? Just as my little plan was complete, what did I hear? I heard\r\nthat you\xe2\x80\x94you!!!\xe2\x80\x94were the foremost person in the house in fetching the\r\npolice. You were the active man; you were the leader; you were working\r\nharder than any of them to recover the jewel! You even carried your\r\naudacity far enough to ask to speak to _me_ about the loss of the\r\nDiamond\xe2\x80\x94the Diamond which you yourself had stolen; the Diamond which\r\nwas all the time in your own hands! After that proof of your horrible\r\nfalseness and cunning, I tore up my letter. But even then\xe2\x80\x94even when I\r\nwas maddened by the searching and questioning of the policeman, whom\r\n_you_ had sent in\xe2\x80\x94even then, there was some infatuation in my mind\r\nwhich wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me give you up. I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98He has played his\r\nvile farce before everybody else in the house. Let me try if he can\r\nplay it before me.\xe2\x80\x99 Somebody told me you were on the terrace. I went\r\ndown to the terrace. I forced myself to look at you; I forced myself to\r\nspeak to you. Have you forgotten what I said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI might have answered that I remembered every word of it. But what\r\npurpose, at that moment, would the answer have served?\r\n\r\nHow could I tell her that what she had said had astonished me, had\r\ndistressed me, had suggested to me that she was in a state of dangerous\r\nnervous excitement, had even roused a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt in my mind whether\r\nthe loss of the jewel was as much a mystery to her as to the rest of\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94but had never once given me so much as a glimpse at the truth?\r\nWithout the shadow of a proof to produce in vindication of my\r\ninnocence, how could I persuade her that I knew no more than the\r\nveriest stranger could have known of what was really in her thoughts\r\nwhen she spoke to me on the terrace?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may suit your convenience to forget; it suits my convenience to\r\nremember,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I said\xe2\x80\x94for I considered it with\r\nmyself, before I said it. I gave you one opportunity after another of\r\nowning the truth. I left nothing unsaid that I _could_ say\xe2\x80\x94short of\r\nactually telling you that I knew you had committed the theft. And all\r\nthe return you made, was to look at me with your vile pretence of\r\nastonishment, and your false face of innocence\xe2\x80\x94just as you have looked\r\nat me today; just as you are looking at me now! I left you, that\r\nmorning, knowing you at last for what you were\xe2\x80\x94for what you are\xe2\x80\x94as base\r\na wretch as ever walked the earth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had spoken out at the time, you might have left me, Rachel,\r\nknowing that you had cruelly wronged an innocent man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had spoken out before other people,\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, with another\r\nburst of indignation, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have been disgraced for life! If I had\r\nspoken out to no ears but yours, you would have denied it, as you are\r\ndenying it now! Do you think I should have believed you? Would a man\r\nhesitate at a lie, who had done what I saw _you_ do\xe2\x80\x94who had behaved\r\nabout it afterwards, as I saw _you_ behave? I tell you again, I shrank\r\nfrom the horror of hearing you lie, after the horror of seeing you\r\nthieve. You talk as if this was a misunderstanding which a few words\r\nmight have set right! Well! the misunderstanding is at an end. Is the\r\nthing set right? No! the thing is just where it was. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nyou _now!_ I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you found the nightgown, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in\r\nRosanna Spearman\xe2\x80\x99s letter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word you have said. You\r\nstole it\xe2\x80\x94I saw you! You affected to help the police\xe2\x80\x94I saw you! You\r\npledged the Diamond to the money-lender in London\xe2\x80\x94I am sure of it! You\r\ncast the suspicion of your disgrace (thanks to my base silence!) on an\r\ninnocent man! You fled to the Continent with your plunder the next\r\nmorning! After all that vileness, there was but one thing more you\r\n_could_ do. You could come here with a last falsehood on your lips\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ncould come here, and tell me that I have wronged you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf I had stayed a moment more, I know not what words might have escaped\r\nme which I should have remembered with vain repentance and regret. I\r\npassed by her, and opened the door for the second time. For the second\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94with the frantic perversity of a roused woman\xe2\x80\x94she caught me by the\r\narm, and barred my way out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go, Rachel\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be better for both of us. Let me\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hysterical passion swelled in her bosom\xe2\x80\x94her quickened convulsive\r\nbreathing almost beat on my face, as she held me back at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d she persisted, desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94why did you come here? Are you afraid I shall expose you? Now you\r\nare a rich man, now you have got a place in the world, now you may\r\nmarry the best lady in the land\xe2\x80\x94are you afraid I shall say the words\r\nwhich I have never said yet to anybody but you? I can\xe2\x80\x99t say the words!\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t expose you! I am worse, if worse can be, than you are\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Sobs and tears burst from her. She struggled with them\r\nfiercely; she held me more and more firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tear you out of my\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9ceven now! You may trust in the shameful, shameful\r\nweakness which can only struggle against you in this way!\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly\r\nlet go of me\xe2\x80\x94she threw up her hands, and wrung them frantically in the\r\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cAny other woman living would shrink from the disgrace of touching\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, God! I despise myself even more heartily than\r\nI despise _him_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tears were forcing their way into my eyes in spite of me\xe2\x80\x94the horror\r\nof it was to be endured no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know that you have wronged me, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr you shall\r\nnever see me again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, I left her. She started up from the chair on which\r\nshe had dropped the moment before: she started up\xe2\x80\x94the noble\r\ncreature!\xe2\x80\x94and followed me across the outer room, with a last merciful\r\nword at parting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFranklin!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you! Oh, Franklin, Franklin! we shall\r\nnever meet again. Say you forgive _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned, so as to let my face show her that I was past speaking\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nturned, and waved my hand, and saw her dimly, as in a vision, through\r\nthe tears that had conquered me at last.\r\n\r\nThe next moment, the worst bitterness of it was over. I was out in the\r\ngarden again. I saw her, and heard her, no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLate that evening, I was surprised at my lodgings by a visit from Mr.\r\nBruff.\r\n\r\nThere was a noticeable change in the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s manner. It had lost its\r\nusual confidence and spirit. He shook hands with me, for the first time\r\nin his life, in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going back to Hampstead?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, by way of saying something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just left Hampstead,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, Mr. Franklin, that\r\nyou have got at the truth at last. But, I tell you plainly, if I could\r\nhave foreseen the price that was to be paid for it, I should have\r\npreferred leaving you in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen Rachel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here after taking her back to Portland Place; it was\r\nimpossible to let her return in the carriage by herself. I can hardly\r\nhold you responsible\xe2\x80\x94considering that you saw her in my house and by my\r\npermission\xe2\x80\x94for the shock that this unlucky interview has inflicted on\r\nher. All I can do is to provide against a repetition of the mischief.\r\nShe is young\xe2\x80\x94she has a resolute spirit\xe2\x80\x94she will get over this, with\r\ntime and rest to help her. I want to be assured that you will do\r\nnothing to hinder her recovery. May I depend on your making no second\r\nattempt to see her\xe2\x80\x94except with my sanction and approval?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what she has suffered, and after what I have suffered,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou may rely on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have your promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff looked relieved. He put down his hat, and drew his chair\r\nnearer to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s settled!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, about the future\xe2\x80\x94_your_ future, I\r\nmean. To my mind, the result of the extraordinary turn which the matter\r\nhas now taken is briefly this. In the first place, we are sure that\r\nRachel has told you the whole truth, as plainly as words can tell it.\r\nIn the second place\xe2\x80\x94though we know that there must be some dreadful\r\nmistake somewhere\xe2\x80\x94we can hardly blame her for believing you to be\r\nguilty, on the evidence of her own senses; backed, as that evidence has\r\nbeen, by circumstances which appear, on the face of them, to tell dead\r\nagainst you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere I interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Rachel,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only regret that\r\nshe could not prevail on herself to speak more plainly to me at the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well regret that Rachel is not somebody else,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nMr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even then, I doubt if a girl of any delicacy, whose\r\nheart had been set on marrying you, could have brought herself to\r\ncharge you to your face with being a thief. Anyhow, it was not in\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s nature to do it. In a very different matter to this matter of\r\nyours\xe2\x80\x94which placed her, however, in a position not altogether unlike\r\nher position towards you\xe2\x80\x94I happen to know that she was influenced by a\r\nsimilar motive to the motive which actuated her conduct in your case.\r\nBesides, as she told me herself, on our way to town this evening, if\r\nshe _had_ spoken plainly, she would no more have believed your denial\r\nthen than she believes it now. What answer can you make to that? There\r\nis no answer to be made to it. Come, come, Mr. Franklin! my view of the\r\ncase has been proved to be all wrong, I admit\xe2\x80\x94but, as things are now,\r\nmy advice may be worth having for all that. I tell you plainly, we\r\nshall be wasting our time, and cudgelling our brains to no purpose, if\r\nwe attempt to try back, and unravel this frightful complication from\r\nthe beginning. Let us close our minds resolutely to all that happened\r\nlast year at Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s country house; and let us look to what we\r\n_can_ discover in the future, instead of to what we can _not_ discover\r\nin the past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you forget,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the whole thing is essentially a\r\nmatter of the past\xe2\x80\x94so far as I am concerned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me this,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the Moonstone at the bottom\r\nof all the mischief\xe2\x80\x94or is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is\xe2\x80\x94of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. What do we believe was done with the Moonstone, when it was\r\ntaken to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was pledged to Mr. Luker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that you are not the person who pledged it. Do we know who\r\ndid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do we believe the Moonstone to be now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeposited in the keeping of Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s bankers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Now observe. We are already in the month of June. Towards the\r\nend of the month (I can\xe2\x80\x99t be particular to a day) a year will have\r\nelapsed from the time when we believe the jewel to have been pledged.\r\nThere is a chance\xe2\x80\x94to say the least\xe2\x80\x94that the person who pawned it, may\r\nbe prepared to redeem it when the year\xe2\x80\x99s time has expired. If he\r\nredeems it, Mr. Luker must himself\xe2\x80\x94according to the terms of his own\r\narrangement\xe2\x80\x94take the Diamond out of his banker\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I propose setting a watch at the bank, as the present\r\nmonth draws to an end, and discovering who the person is to whom Mr.\r\nLuker restores the Moonstone. Do you see it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI admitted (a little unwillingly) that the idea was a new one, at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Murthwaite\xe2\x80\x99s idea quite as much as mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmight have never entered my head, but for a conversation we had\r\ntogether some time since. If Mr. Murthwaite is right, the Indians are\r\nlikely to be on the lookout at the bank, towards the end of the month\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94and something serious may come of it. What comes of it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter to you and me except as it may help us to lay our hands on the\r\nmysterious Somebody who pawned the Diamond. That person, you may rely\r\non it, is responsible (I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know how) for the position in\r\nwhich you stand at this moment; and that person alone can set you right\r\nin Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s estimation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t deny,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the plan you propose meets the difficulty\r\nin a way that is very daring, and very ingenious, and very new. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have an objection to make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. My objection is, that your proposal obliges us to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranted. As I reckon the time, it requires you to wait about a\r\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x94more or less. Is that so very long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a life-time, Mr. Bruff, in such a situation as mine. My existence\r\nwill be simply unendurable to me, unless I do something towards\r\nclearing my character at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I understand that. Have you thought yet of what you can\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of consulting Sergeant Cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has retired from the police. It\xe2\x80\x99s useless to expect the Sergeant to\r\nhelp you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know where to find him; and I can but try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cThe case has\r\nassumed such an extraordinary aspect since Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s time, that\r\nyou _may_ revive his interest in the inquiry. Try, and let me hear the\r\nresult. In the meanwhile,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cif you make no\r\ndiscoveries between this, and the end of the month, am I free to try,\r\non my side, what can be done by keeping a lookout at the bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunless I relieve you of all necessity for\r\ntrying the experiment in the interval.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff smiled, and took up his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Sergeant Cuff,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat _I_ say the discovery of the\r\ntruth depends on the discovery of the person who pawned the Diamond.\r\nAnd let me hear what the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s experience says to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we parted.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, I set forth for the little town of Dorking\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nplace of Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s retirement, as indicated to me by Betteredge.\r\n\r\nInquiring at the hotel, I received the necessary directions for finding\r\nthe Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s cottage. It was approached by a quiet bye-road, a little\r\nway out of the town, and it stood snugly in the middle of its own plot\r\nof garden ground, protected by a good brick wall at the back and the\r\nsides, and by a high quickset hedge in front. The gate, ornamented at\r\nthe upper part by smartly-painted trellis-work, was locked. After\r\nringing at the bell, I peered through the trellis-work, and saw the\r\ngreat Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s favourite flower everywhere; blooming in his garden,\r\nclustering over his door, looking in at his windows. Far from the\r\ncrimes and the mysteries of the great city, the illustrious thief-taker\r\nwas placidly living out the last Sybarite years of his life, smothered\r\nin roses!\r\n\r\nA decent elderly woman opened the gate to me, and at once annihilated\r\nall the hopes I had built on securing the assistance of Sergeant Cuff.\r\nHe had started, only the day before, on a journey to Ireland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he gone there on business?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nThe woman smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has only one business now, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s roses. Some great man\xe2\x80\x99s gardener in Ireland has found out\r\nsomething new in the growing of roses\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s away to inquire\r\ninto it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know when he will be back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite uncertain, sir. Mr. Cuff said he should come back directly,\r\nor be away some time, just according as he found the new discovery\r\nworth nothing, or worth looking into. If you have any message to leave\r\nfor him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care, sir, that he gets it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave her my card, having first written on it in pencil: \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nsomething to say about the Moonstone. Let me hear from you as soon as\r\nyou get back.\xe2\x80\x9d That done, there was nothing left but to submit to\r\ncircumstances, and return to London.\r\n\r\nIn the irritable condition of my mind, at the time of which I am now\r\nwriting, the abortive result of my journey to the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s cottage\r\nsimply aggravated the restless impulse in me to be doing something. On\r\nthe day of my return from Dorking, I determined that the next morning\r\nshould find me bent on a new effort at forcing my way, through all\r\nobstacles, from the darkness to the light.\r\n\r\nWhat form was my next experiment to take?\r\n\r\nIf the excellent Betteredge had been present while I was considering\r\nthat question, and if he had been let into the secret of my thoughts,\r\nhe would, no doubt, have declared that the German side of me was, on\r\nthis occasion, my uppermost side. To speak seriously, it is perhaps\r\npossible that my German training was in some degree responsible for the\r\nlabyrinth of useless speculations in which I now involved myself. For\r\nthe greater part of the night, I sat smoking, and building up theories,\r\none more profoundly improbable than another. When I did get to sleep,\r\nmy waking fancies pursued me in dreams. I rose the next morning, with\r\nObjective-Subjective and Subjective-Objective inextricably entangled\r\ntogether in my mind; and I began the day which was to witness my next\r\neffort at practical action of some kind, by doubting whether I had any\r\nsort of right (on purely philosophical grounds) to consider any sort of\r\nthing (the Diamond included) as existing at all.\r\n\r\nHow long I might have remained lost in the mist of my own metaphysics,\r\nif I had been left to extricate myself, it is impossible for me to say.\r\nAs the event proved, accident came to my rescue, and happily delivered\r\nme. I happened to wear, that morning, the same coat which I had worn on\r\nthe day of my interview with Rachel. Searching for something else in\r\none of the pockets, I came upon a crumpled piece of paper, and, taking\r\nit out, found Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten letter in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt seemed hard on my good old friend to leave him without a reply. I\r\nwent to my writing-table, and read his letter again.\r\n\r\nA letter which has nothing of the slightest importance in it, is not\r\nalways an easy letter to answer. Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s present effort at\r\ncorresponding with me came within this category. Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s assistant,\r\notherwise Ezra Jennings, had told his master that he had seen me; and\r\nMr. Candy, in his turn, wanted to see me and say something to me, when\r\nI was next in the neighbourhood of Frizinghall. What was to be said in\r\nanswer to that, which would be worth the paper it was written on? I sat\r\nidly drawing likenesses from memory of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable-looking\r\nassistant, on the sheet of paper which I had vowed to dedicate to\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x94until it suddenly occurred to me that here was the\r\nirrepressible Ezra Jennings getting in my way again! I threw a dozen\r\nportraits, at least, of the man with the piebald hair (the hair in\r\nevery case, remarkably like), into the waste-paper basket\xe2\x80\x94and then and\r\nthere, wrote my answer to Betteredge. It was a perfectly commonplace\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x94but it had one excellent effect on me. The effort of writing a\r\nfew sentences, in plain English, completely cleared my mind of the\r\ncloudy nonsense which had filled it since the previous day.\r\n\r\nDevoting myself once more to the elucidation of the impenetrable puzzle\r\nwhich my own position presented to me, I now tried to meet the\r\ndifficulty by investigating it from a plainly practical point of view.\r\nThe events of the memorable night being still unintelligible to me, I\r\nlooked a little farther back, and searched my memory of the earlier\r\nhours of the birthday for any incident which might prove of some\r\nassistance to me in finding the clue.\r\n\r\nHad anything happened while Rachel and I were finishing the painted\r\ndoor? or, later, when I rode over to Frizinghall? or afterwards, when I\r\nwent back with Godfrey Ablewhite and his sisters? or, later again, when\r\nI put the Moonstone into Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hands? or, later still, when the\r\ncompany came, and we all assembled round the dinner-table? My memory\r\ndisposed of that string of questions readily enough, until I came to\r\nthe last. Looking back at the social event of the birthday dinner, I\r\nfound myself brought to a standstill at the outset of the inquiry. I\r\nwas not even capable of accurately remembering the number of the guests\r\nwho had sat at the same table with me.\r\n\r\nTo feel myself completely at fault here, and to conclude, thereupon,\r\nthat the incidents of the dinner might especially repay the trouble of\r\ninvestigating them, formed parts of the same mental process, in my\r\ncase. I believe other people, in a similar situation, would have\r\nreasoned as I did. When the pursuit of our own interests causes us to\r\nbecome objects of inquiry to ourselves, we are naturally suspicious of\r\nwhat we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Once in possession of the names of the persons who\r\nhad been present at the dinner, I resolved\xe2\x80\x94as a means of enriching the\r\ndeficient resources of my own memory\xe2\x80\x94to appeal to the memory of the\r\nrest of the guests; to write down all that they could recollect of the\r\nsocial events of the birthday; and to test the result, thus obtained,\r\nby the light of what had happened afterwards, when the company had left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThis last and newest of my many contemplated experiments in the art of\r\ninquiry\xe2\x80\x94which Betteredge would probably have attributed to the\r\nclear-headed, or French, side of me being uppermost for the moment\xe2\x80\x94may\r\nfairly claim record here, on its own merits. Unlikely as it may seem, I\r\nhad now actually groped my way to the root of the matter at last. All I\r\nwanted was a hint to guide me in the right direction at starting.\r\nBefore another day had passed over my head, that hint was given me by\r\none of the company who had been present at the birthday feast!\r\n\r\nWith the plan of proceeding which I now had in view, it was first\r\nnecessary to possess the complete list of the guests. This I could\r\neasily obtain from Gabriel Betteredge. I determined to go back to\r\nYorkshire on that day, and to begin my contemplated investigation the\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nIt was just too late to start by the train which left London before\r\nnoon. There was no alternative but to wait, nearly three hours, for the\r\ndeparture of the next train. Was there anything I could do in London,\r\nwhich might usefully occupy this interval of time?\r\n\r\nMy thoughts went back again obstinately to the birthday dinner.\r\n\r\nThough I had forgotten the numbers, and, in many cases, the names of\r\nthe guests, I remembered readily enough that by far the larger\r\nproportion of them came from Frizinghall, or from its neighbourhood.\r\nBut the larger proportion was not all. Some few of us were not regular\r\nresidents in the country. I myself was one of the few. Mr. Murthwaite\r\nwas another. Godfrey Ablewhite was a third. Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x94no: I called to\r\nmind that business had prevented Mr. Bruff from making one of the\r\nparty. Had any ladies been present, whose usual residence was in\r\nLondon? I could only remember Miss Clack as coming within this latter\r\ncategory. However, here were three of the guests, at any rate, whom it\r\nwas clearly advisable for me to see before I left town. I drove off at\r\nonce to Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s office; not knowing the addresses of the persons of\r\nwhom I was in search, and thinking it probable that he might put me in\r\nthe way of finding them.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff proved to be too busy to give me more than a minute of his\r\nvaluable time. In that minute, however, he contrived to dispose\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nmost discouraging manner\xe2\x80\x94of all the questions I had to put to him.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he considered my newly-discovered method of finding\r\na clue to the mystery as something too purely fanciful to be seriously\r\ndiscussed. In the second, third, and fourth places, Mr. Murthwaite was\r\nnow on his way back to the scene of his past adventures; Miss Clack had\r\nsuffered losses, and had settled, from motives of economy, in France;\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite might, or might not, be discoverable somewhere in\r\nLondon. Suppose I inquired at his club? And suppose I excused Mr.\r\nBruff, if he went back to his business and wished me good morning?\r\n\r\nThe field of inquiry in London, being now so narrowed as only to\r\ninclude the one necessity of discovering Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s address, I took the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s hint, and drove to his club.\r\n\r\nIn the hall, I met with one of the members, who was an old friend of my\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s, and who was also an acquaintance of my own. This gentleman,\r\nafter enlightening me on the subject of Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s address, told me of\r\ntwo recent events in his life, which were of some importance in\r\nthemselves, and which had not previously reached my ears.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Godfrey, far from being discouraged by Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwithdrawal from her engagement to him had made matrimonial advances\r\nsoon afterwards to another young lady, reputed to be a great heiress.\r\nHis suit had prospered, and his marriage had been considered as a\r\nsettled and certain thing. But, here again, the engagement had been\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly broken off\xe2\x80\x94owing, it was said, on this\r\noccasion, to a serious difference of opinion between the bridegroom and\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s father, on the question of settlements.\r\n\r\nAs some compensation for this second matrimonial disaster, Godfrey had\r\nsoon afterwards found himself the object of fond pecuniary remembrance,\r\non the part of one of his many admirers. A rich old lady\xe2\x80\x94highly\r\nrespected at the Mothers\xe2\x80\x99 Small-Clothes-Conversion-Society, and a great\r\nfriend of Miss Clack\xe2\x80\x99s (to whom she left nothing but a mourning\r\nring)\xe2\x80\x94had bequeathed to the admirable and meritorious Godfrey a legacy\r\nof five thousand pounds. After receiving this handsome addition to his\r\nown modest pecuniary resources, he had been heard to say that he felt\r\nthe necessity of getting a little respite from his charitable labours,\r\nand that his doctor prescribed \xe2\x80\x9ca run on the Continent, as likely to be\r\nproductive of much future benefit to his health.\xe2\x80\x9d If I wanted to see\r\nhim, it would be advisable to lose no time in paying my contemplated\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nI went, then and there, to pay my visit.\r\n\r\nThe same fatality which had made me just one day too late in calling on\r\nSergeant Cuff, made me again one day too late in calling on Godfrey. He\r\nhad left London, on the previous morning, by the tidal train, for\r\nDover. He was to cross to Ostend; and his servant believed he was going\r\non to Brussels. The time of his return was rather uncertain; but I\r\nmight be sure he would be away at least three months.\r\n\r\nI went back to my lodgings a little depressed in spirits. Three of the\r\nguests at the birthday dinner\xe2\x80\x94and those three all exceptionally\r\nintelligent people\xe2\x80\x94were out of my reach, at the very time when it was\r\nmost important to be able to communicate with them. My last hopes now\r\nrested on Betteredge, and on the friends of the late Lady Verinder whom\r\nI might still find living in the neighbourhood of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s country\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, I travelled straight to Frizinghall\xe2\x80\x94the town being\r\nnow the central point in my field of inquiry. I arrived too late in the\r\nevening to be able to communicate with Betteredge. The next morning, I\r\nsent a messenger with a letter, requesting him to join me at the hotel,\r\nat his earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nHaving taken the precaution\xe2\x80\x94partly to save time, partly to accommodate\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x94of sending my messenger in a fly, I had a reasonable\r\nprospect, if no delays occurred, of seeing the old man within less than\r\ntwo hours from the time when I had sent for him. During this interval,\r\nI arranged to employ myself in opening my contemplated inquiry, among\r\nthe guests present at the birthday dinner who were personally known to\r\nme, and who were easily within my reach. These were my relatives, the\r\nAblewhites, and Mr. Candy. The doctor had expressed a special wish to\r\nsee me, and the doctor lived in the next street. So to Mr. Candy I went\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nAfter what Betteredge had told me, I naturally anticipated finding\r\ntraces in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s face of the severe illness from which he had\r\nsuffered. But I was utterly unprepared for such a change as I saw in\r\nhim when he entered the room and shook hands with me. His eyes were\r\ndim; his hair had turned completely grey; his face was wizen; his\r\nfigure had shrunk. I looked at the once lively, rattlepated, humorous\r\nlittle doctor\xe2\x80\x94associated in my remembrance with the perpetration of\r\nincorrigible social indiscretions and innumerable boyish jokes\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nsaw nothing left of his former self, but the old tendency to vulgar\r\nsmartness in his dress. The man was a wreck; but his clothes and his\r\njewellery\xe2\x80\x94in cruel mockery of the change in him\xe2\x80\x94were as gay and as\r\ngaudy as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often thought of you, Mr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I am heartily\r\nglad to see you again at last. If there is anything I can do for you,\r\npray command my services, sir\xe2\x80\x94pray command my services!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said those few commonplace words with needless hurry and eagerness,\r\nand with a curiosity to know what had brought me to Yorkshire, which he\r\nwas perfectly\xe2\x80\x94I might say childishly\xe2\x80\x94incapable of concealing from\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nWith the object that I had in view, I had of course foreseen the\r\nnecessity of entering into some sort of personal explanation, before I\r\ncould hope to interest people, mostly strangers to me, in doing their\r\nbest to assist my inquiry. On the journey to Frizinghall I had arranged\r\nwhat my explanation was to be\xe2\x80\x94and I seized the opportunity now offered\r\nto me of trying the effect of it on Mr. Candy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in Yorkshire, the other day, and I am in Yorkshire again now, on\r\nrather a romantic errand,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a matter, Mr. Candy, in which\r\nthe late Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s friends all took some interest. You remember\r\nthe mysterious loss of the Indian Diamond, now nearly a year since?\r\nCircumstances have lately happened which lead to the hope that it may\r\nyet be found\xe2\x80\x94and I am interesting myself, as one of the family, in\r\nrecovering it. Among the obstacles in my way, there is the necessity of\r\ncollecting again all the evidence which was discovered at the time, and\r\nmore if possible. There are peculiarities in this case which make it\r\ndesirable to revive my recollection of everything that happened in the\r\nhouse, on the evening of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. And I venture to\r\nappeal to her late mother\xe2\x80\x99s friends who were present on that occasion,\r\nto lend me the assistance of their memories\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had got as far as that in rehearsing my explanatory phrases, when I\r\nwas suddenly checked by seeing plainly in Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s face that my\r\nexperiment on him was a total failure.\r\n\r\nThe little doctor sat restlessly picking at the points of his fingers\r\nall the time I was speaking. His dim watery eyes were fixed on my face\r\nwith an expression of vacant and wistful inquiry very painful to see.\r\nWhat he was thinking of, it was impossible to divine. The one thing\r\nclearly visible was that I had failed, after the first two or three\r\nwords, in fixing his attention. The only chance of recalling him to\r\nhimself appeared to lie in changing the subject. I tried a new topic\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, gaily, \xe2\x80\x9cfor what brings me to Frizinghall! Now, Mr.\r\nCandy, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn. You sent me a message by Gabriel Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left off picking at his fingers, and suddenly brightened up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it! I sent you a\r\nmessage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Betteredge duly communicated it by letter,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had\r\nsomething to say to me, the next time I was in your neighbourhood.\r\nWell, Mr. Candy, here I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Betteredge was quite right. I\r\nhad something to say to you. That was my message. Betteredge is a\r\nwonderful man. What a memory! At his age, what a memory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped back into silence, and began picking at his fingers again.\r\nRecollecting what I had heard from Betteredge about the effect of the\r\nfever on his memory, I went on with the conversation, in the hope that\r\nI might help him at starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long time since we met,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe last saw each other at the\r\nlast birthday dinner my poor aunt was ever to give.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Candy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe birthday dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d He started\r\nimpulsively to his feet, and looked at me. A deep flush suddenly\r\noverspread his faded face, and he abruptly sat down again, as if\r\nconscious of having betrayed a weakness which he would fain have\r\nconcealed. It was plain, pitiably plain, that he was aware of his own\r\ndefect of memory, and that he was bent on hiding it from the\r\nobservation of his friends.\r\n\r\nThus far he had appealed to my compassion only. But the words he had\r\njust said\xe2\x80\x94few as they were\xe2\x80\x94roused my curiosity instantly to the highest\r\npitch. The birthday dinner had already become the one event in the\r\npast, at which I looked back with strangely-mixed feelings of hope and\r\ndistrust. And here was the birthday dinner unmistakably proclaiming\r\nitself as the subject on which Mr. Candy had something important to say\r\nto me!\r\n\r\nI attempted to help him out once more. But, this time, my own interests\r\nwere at the bottom of my compassionate motive, and they hurried me on a\r\nlittle too abruptly, to the end I had in view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nearly a year now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9csince we sat at that pleasant table.\r\nHave you made any memorandum\xe2\x80\x94in your diary, or otherwise\xe2\x80\x94of what you\r\nwanted to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Candy understood the suggestion, and showed me that he understood\r\nit, as an insult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI require no memorandum, Mr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stiffly enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot such a very old man, yet\xe2\x80\x94and my memory (thank God) is to be\r\nthoroughly depended on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that I declined to understand that he was\r\noffended with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could say the same of _my_ memory,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen _I_ try\r\nto think of matters that are a year old, I seldom find my remembrance\r\nas vivid as I could wish it to be. Take the dinner at Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nfor instance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Candy brightened up again, the moment the allusion passed my lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the dinner, the dinner at Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, more\r\neagerly than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got something to say to you about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes looked at me again with the painful expression of inquiry, so\r\nwistful, so vacant, so miserably helpless to see. He was evidently\r\ntrying hard, and trying in vain, to recover the lost recollection. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas a very pleasant dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out suddenly, with an air of\r\nsaying exactly what he wanted to say. \xe2\x80\x9cA very pleasant dinner, Mr.\r\nBlake, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d He nodded and smiled, and appeared to think, poor\r\nfellow, that he had succeeded in concealing the total failure of his\r\nmemory, by a well-timed exertion of his own presence of mind.\r\n\r\nIt was so distressing that I at once shifted the talk\xe2\x80\x94deeply as I was\r\ninterested in his recovering the lost remembrance\xe2\x80\x94to topics of local\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nHere, he got on glibly enough. Trumpery little scandals and quarrels in\r\nthe town, some of them as much as a month old, appeared to recur to his\r\nmemory readily. He chattered on, with something of the smooth gossiping\r\nfluency of former times. But there were moments, even in the full flow\r\nof his talkativeness, when he suddenly hesitated\xe2\x80\x94looked at me for a\r\nmoment with the vacant inquiry once more in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94controlled\r\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94and went on again. I submitted patiently to my martyrdom (it is\r\nsurely nothing less than martyrdom to a man of cosmopolitan sympathies,\r\nto absorb in silent resignation the news of a country town?) until the\r\nclock on the chimney-piece told me that my visit had been prolonged\r\nbeyond half an hour. Having now some right to consider the sacrifice as\r\ncomplete, I rose to take leave. As we shook hands, Mr. Candy reverted\r\nto the birthday festival of his own accord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad we have met again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had it on my mind\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nreally had it on my mind, Mr. Blake, to speak to you. About the dinner\r\nat Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s, you know? A pleasant dinner\xe2\x80\x94really a pleasant\r\ndinner now, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn repeating the phrase, he seemed to feel hardly as certain of having\r\nprevented me from suspecting his lapse of memory, as he had felt on the\r\nfirst occasion. The wistful look clouded his face again: and, after\r\napparently designing to accompany me to the street door, he suddenly\r\nchanged his mind, rang the bell for the servant, and remained in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nI went slowly down the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s stairs, feeling the disheartening\r\nconviction that he really had something to say which it was vitally\r\nimportant to me to hear, and that he was morally incapable of saying\r\nit. The effort of remembering that he wanted to speak to me was, but\r\ntoo evidently, the only effort that his enfeebled memory was now able\r\nto achieve.\r\n\r\nJust as I reached the bottom of the stairs, and had turned a corner on\r\nmy way to the outer hall, a door opened softly somewhere on the ground\r\nfloor of the house, and a gentle voice said behind me:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, sir, you find Mr. Candy sadly changed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned round, and found myself face to face with Ezra Jennings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s pretty housemaid stood waiting for me, with the street\r\ndoor open in her hand. Pouring brightly into the hall, the morning\r\nlight fell full on the face of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s assistant when I turned, and\r\nlooked at him.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to dispute Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the appearance\r\nof Ezra Jennings, speaking from a popular point of view, was against\r\nhim. His gipsy-complexion, his fleshless cheeks, his gaunt facial\r\nbones, his dreamy eyes, his extraordinary parti-coloured hair, the\r\npuzzling contradiction between his face and figure which made him look\r\nold and young both together\xe2\x80\x94were all more or less calculated to produce\r\nan unfavourable impression of him on a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s mind. And yet\xe2\x80\x94feeling\r\nthis as I certainly did\xe2\x80\x94it is not to be denied that Ezra Jennings made\r\nsome inscrutable appeal to my sympathies, which I found it impossible\r\nto resist. While my knowledge of the world warned me to answer the\r\nquestion which he had put, acknowledging that I did indeed find Mr.\r\nCandy sadly changed, and then to proceed on my way out of the house\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ninterest in Ezra Jennings held me rooted to the place, and gave him the\r\nopportunity of speaking to me in private about his employer, for which\r\nhe had been evidently on the watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you walking my way, Mr. Jennings?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, observing that he held\r\nhis hat in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to call on my aunt, Mrs. Ablewhite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings replied that he had a patient to see, and that he was\r\nwalking my way.\r\n\r\nWe left the house together. I observed that the pretty servant girl\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nwas all smiles and amiability, when I wished her good morning on my way\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94received a modest little message from Ezra Jennings, relating to\r\nthe time at which he might be expected to return, with pursed-up lips,\r\nand with eyes which ostentatiously looked anywhere rather than look in\r\nhis face. The poor wretch was evidently no favourite in the house. Out\r\nof the house, I had Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s word for it that he was unpopular\r\neverywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a life!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself, as we descended the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s doorsteps.\r\n\r\nHaving already referred to Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s illness on his side, Ezra\r\nJennings now appeared determined to leave it to me to resume the\r\nsubject. His silence said significantly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your turn now.\xe2\x80\x9d I, too,\r\nhad my reasons for referring to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s illness: and I readily\r\naccepted the responsibility of speaking first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudging by the change I see in him,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s illness\r\nmust have been far more serious than I had supposed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is almost a miracle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ezra Jennings, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he lived through\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs his memory never any better than I have found it today? He has been\r\ntrying to speak to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf something which happened before he was taken ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nassistant, observing that I hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis memory of events, at that past time, is hopelessly enfeebled,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ezra Jennings. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is almost to be deplored, poor fellow, that\r\neven the wreck of it remains. While he remembers dimly plans that he\r\nformed\xe2\x80\x94things, here and there, that he had to say or do before his\r\nillness\xe2\x80\x94he is perfectly incapable of recalling what the plans were, or\r\nwhat the thing was that he had to say or do. He is painfully conscious\r\nof his own deficiency, and painfully anxious, as you must have seen, to\r\nhide it from observation. If he could only have recovered in a complete\r\nstate of oblivion as to the past, he would have been a happier man.\r\nPerhaps we should all be happier,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a sad smile, \xe2\x80\x9cif we\r\ncould but completely forget!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some events surely in all men\xe2\x80\x99s lives,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nmemory of which they would be unwilling entirely to lose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, I hope, to be said of most men, Mr. Blake. I am afraid it\r\ncannot truly be said of _all_. Have you any reason to suppose that the\r\nlost remembrance which Mr. Candy tried to recover\xe2\x80\x94while you were\r\nspeaking to him just now\xe2\x80\x94was a remembrance which it was important to\r\n_you_ that he should recall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn saying those words, he had touched, of his own accord, on the very\r\npoint upon which I was anxious to consult him. The interest I felt in\r\nthis strange man had impelled me, in the first instance, to give him\r\nthe opportunity of speaking to me; reserving what I might have to say,\r\non my side, in relation to his employer, until I was first satisfied\r\nthat he was a person in whose delicacy and discretion I could trust.\r\nThe little that he had said, thus far, had been sufficient to convince\r\nme that I was speaking to a gentleman. He had what I may venture to\r\ndescribe as the _unsought self-possession_, which is a sure sign of\r\ngood breeding, not in England only, but everywhere else in the\r\ncivilised world. Whatever the object which he had in view, in putting\r\nthe question that he had just addressed to me, I felt no doubt that I\r\nwas justified\xe2\x80\x94so far\xe2\x80\x94in answering him without reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have a strong interest,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cin tracing the lost\r\nremembrance which Mr. Candy was unable to recall. May I ask whether you\r\ncan suggest to me any method by which I might assist his memory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings looked at me, with a sudden flash of interest in his\r\ndreamy brown eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s memory is beyond the reach of assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave tried to help it often enough since his recovery, to be able to\r\nspeak positively on that point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis disappointed me; and I owned it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess you led me to hope for a less discouraging answer than\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may not, perhaps, be a final answer, Mr.\r\nBlake. It may be possible to trace Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s lost recollection,\r\nwithout the necessity of appealing to Mr. Candy himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Is it an indiscretion, on my part, to ask how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. My only difficulty in answering your question, is the\r\ndifficulty of explaining myself. May I trust to your patience, if I\r\nrefer once more to Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s illness: and if I speak of it this time\r\nwithout sparing you certain professional details?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray go on! You have interested me already in hearing the details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eagerness seemed to amuse\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, I might rather say, to please\r\nhim. He smiled again. We had by this time left the last houses in the\r\ntown behind us. Ezra Jennings stopped for a moment, and picked some\r\nwild flowers from the hedge by the roadside. \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, simply, showing his little nosegay to me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how few people\r\nin England seem to admire them as they deserve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not always been in England?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I was born, and partly brought up, in one of our colonies. My\r\nfather was an Englishman; but my mother\xe2\x80\x94We are straying away from our\r\nsubject, Mr. Blake; and it is my fault. The truth is, I have\r\nassociations with these modest little hedgeside flowers\xe2\x80\x94It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter; we were speaking of Mr. Candy. To Mr. Candy let us return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConnecting the few words about himself which thus reluctantly escaped\r\nhim, with the melancholy view of life which led him to place the\r\nconditions of human happiness in complete oblivion of the past, I felt\r\nsatisfied that the story which I had read in his face was, in two\r\nparticulars at least, the story that it really told. He had suffered as\r\nfew men suffer; and there was the mixture of some foreign race in his\r\nEnglish blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard, I dare say, of the original cause of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness?\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night of Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s dinner-party was a\r\nnight of heavy rain. My employer drove home through it in his gig, and\r\nreached the house wetted to the skin. He found an urgent message from a\r\npatient, waiting for him; and he most unfortunately went at once to\r\nvisit the sick person, without stopping to change his clothes. I was\r\nmyself professionally detained, that night, by a case at some distance\r\nfrom Frizinghall. When I got back the next morning, I found Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngroom waiting in great alarm to take me to his master\xe2\x80\x99s room. By that\r\ntime the mischief was done; the illness had set in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe illness has only been described to me, in general terms, as a\r\nfever,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can add nothing which will make the description more accurate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Ezra Jennings. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom first to last the fever assumed no\r\nspecific form. I sent at once to two of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s medical friends in\r\nthe town, both physicians, to come and give me their opinion of the\r\ncase. They agreed with me that it looked serious; but they both\r\nstrongly dissented from the view I took of the treatment. We differed\r\nentirely in the conclusions which we drew from the patient\xe2\x80\x99s pulse. The\r\ntwo doctors, arguing from the rapidity of the beat, declared that a\r\nlowering treatment was the only treatment to be adopted. On my side, I\r\nadmitted the rapidity of the pulse, but I also pointed to its alarming\r\nfeebleness as indicating an exhausted condition of the system, and as\r\nshowing a plain necessity for the administration of stimulants. The two\r\ndoctors were for keeping him on gruel, lemonade, barley-water, and so\r\non. I was for giving him champagne, or brandy, ammonia, and quinine. A\r\nserious difference of opinion, as you see! A difference between two\r\nphysicians of established local repute, and a stranger who was only an\r\nassistant in the house. For the first few days, I had no choice but to\r\ngive way to my elders and betters; the patient steadily sinking all the\r\ntime. I made a second attempt to appeal to the plain, undeniably plain,\r\nevidence of the pulse. Its rapidity was unchecked, and its feebleness\r\nhad increased. The two doctors took offence at my obstinacy. They said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Jennings, either we manage this case, or you manage it. Which is\r\nit to be?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, give me five minutes to consider, and\r\nthat plain question shall have a plain reply.\xe2\x80\x99 When the time expired, I\r\nwas ready with my answer. I said, \xe2\x80\x98You positively refuse to try the\r\nstimulant treatment?\xe2\x80\x99 They refused in so many words. \xe2\x80\x98I mean to try it\r\nat once, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Try it, Mr. Jennings, and we withdraw from the\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x99 I sent down to the cellar for a bottle of champagne; and I\r\nadministered half a tumbler-full of it to the patient with my own hand.\r\nThe two physicians took up their hats in silence, and left the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had assumed a serious responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn your place, I\r\nam afraid I should have shrunk from it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my place, Mr. Blake, you would have remembered that Mr. Candy had\r\ntaken you into his employment, under circumstances which made you his\r\ndebtor for life. In my place, you would have seen him sinking, hour by\r\nhour; and you would have risked anything, rather than let the one man\r\non earth who had befriended you, die before your eyes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\r\nthat I had no sense of the terrible position in which I had placed\r\nmyself! There were moments when I felt all the misery of my\r\nfriendlessness, all the peril of my dreadful responsibility. If I had\r\nbeen a happy man, if I had led a prosperous life, I believe I should\r\nhave sunk under the task I had imposed on myself. But _I_ had no happy\r\ntime to look back at, no past peace of mind to force itself into\r\ncontrast with my present anxiety and suspense\xe2\x80\x94and I held firm to my\r\nresolution through it all. I took an interval in the middle of the day,\r\nwhen my patient\xe2\x80\x99s condition was at its best, for the repose I needed.\r\nFor the rest of the four-and-twenty hours, as long as his life was in\r\ndanger, I never left his bedside. Towards sunset, as usual in such\r\ncases, the delirium incidental to the fever came on. It lasted more or\r\nless through the night; and then intermitted, at that terrible time in\r\nthe early morning\xe2\x80\x94from two o\xe2\x80\x99clock to five\xe2\x80\x94when the vital energies even\r\nof the healthiest of us are at their lowest. It is then that Death\r\ngathers in his human harvest most abundantly. It was then that Death\r\nand I fought our fight over the bed, which should have the man who lay\r\non it. I never hesitated in pursuing the treatment on which I had\r\nstaked everything. When wine failed, I tried brandy. When the other\r\nstimulants lost their influence, I doubled the dose. After an interval\r\nof suspense\xe2\x80\x94the like of which I hope to God I shall never feel\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94there came a day when the rapidity of the pulse slightly, but\r\nappreciably, diminished; and, better still, there came also a change in\r\nthe beat\xe2\x80\x94an unmistakable change to steadiness and strength. _Then_, I\r\nknew that I had saved him; and then I own I broke down. I laid the poor\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s wasted hand back on the bed, and burst out crying. An\r\nhysterical relief, Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x94nothing more! Physiology says, and says\r\ntruly, that some men are born with female constitutions\xe2\x80\x94and I am one of\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made that bitterly professional apology for his tears, speaking\r\nquietly and unaffectedly, as he had spoken throughout. His tone and\r\nmanner, from beginning to end, showed him to be especially, almost\r\nmorbidly, anxious not to set himself up as an object of interest to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well ask, why I have wearied you with all these details?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only way I can see, Mr. Blake, of properly\r\nintroducing to you what I have to say next. Now you know exactly what\r\nmy position was, at the time of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s illness, you will the more\r\nreadily understand the sore need I had of lightening the burden on my\r\nmind by giving it, at intervals, some sort of relief. I have had the\r\npresumption to occupy my leisure, for some years past, in writing a\r\nbook, addressed to the members of my profession\xe2\x80\x94a book on the intricate\r\nand delicate subject of the brain and the nervous system. My work will\r\nprobably never be finished; and it will certainly never be published.\r\nIt has none the less been the friend of many lonely hours; and it\r\nhelped me to while away the anxious time\xe2\x80\x94the time of waiting, and\r\nnothing else\xe2\x80\x94at Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. I told you he was delirious, I\r\nthink? And I mentioned the time at which his delirium came on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had reached a section of my book, at that time, which touched\r\non this same question of delirium. I won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you at any length\r\nwith my theory on the subject\xe2\x80\x94I will confine myself to telling you only\r\nwhat it is your present interest to know. It has often occurred to me\r\nin the course of my medical practice, to doubt whether we can\r\njustifiably infer\xe2\x80\x94in cases of delirium\xe2\x80\x94that the loss of the faculty of\r\nspeaking connectedly, implies of necessity the loss of the faculty of\r\nthinking connectedly as well. Poor Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s illness gave me an\r\nopportunity of putting this doubt to the test. I understand the art of\r\nwriting in shorthand; and I was able to take down the patient\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98wanderings\xe2\x80\x99, exactly as they fell from his lips.\xe2\x80\x94Do you see, Mr.\r\nBlake, what I am coming to at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw it clearly, and waited with breathless interest to hear more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt odds and ends of time,\xe2\x80\x9d Ezra Jennings went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI reproduced my\r\nshorthand notes, in the ordinary form of writing\xe2\x80\x94leaving large spaces\r\nbetween the broken phrases, and even the single words, as they had\r\nfallen disconnectedly from Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s lips. I then treated the result\r\nthus obtained, on something like the principle which one adopts in\r\nputting together a child\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98puzzle.\xe2\x80\x99 It is all confusion to begin with;\r\nbut it may be all brought into order and shape, if you can only find\r\nthe right way. Acting on this plan, I filled in each blank space on the\r\npaper, with what the words or phrases on either side of it suggested to\r\nme as the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s meaning; altering over and over again, until my\r\nadditions followed naturally on the spoken words which came before\r\nthem, and fitted naturally into the spoken words which came after them.\r\nThe result was, that I not only occupied in this way many vacant and\r\nanxious hours, but that I arrived at something which was (as it seemed\r\nto me) a confirmation of the theory that I held. In plainer words,\r\nafter putting the broken sentences together I found the superior\r\nfaculty of thinking going on, more or less connectedly, in my patient\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, while the inferior faculty of expression was in a state of almost\r\ncomplete incapacity and confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word!\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cDid my name occur in any of his\r\nwanderings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear, Mr. Blake. Among my written proofs of the assertion\r\nwhich I have just advanced\xe2\x80\x94or, I ought to say, among the written\r\nexperiments, tending to put my assertion to the proof\xe2\x80\x94there _is_ one,\r\nin which your name occurs. For nearly the whole of one night, Mr.\r\nCandy\xe2\x80\x99s mind was occupied with _something_ between himself and you. I\r\nhave got the broken words, as they dropped from his lips, on one sheet\r\nof paper. And I have got the links of my own discovering which connect\r\nthose words together, on another sheet of paper. The product (as the\r\narithmeticians would say) is an intelligible statement\xe2\x80\x94first, of\r\nsomething actually done in the past; secondly, of something which Mr.\r\nCandy contemplated doing in the future, if his illness had not got in\r\nthe way, and stopped him. The question is whether this does, or does\r\nnot, represent the lost recollection which he vainly attempted to find\r\nwhen you called on him this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go back directly, and look at\r\nthe papers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible, Mr. Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut yourself in my position for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ezra Jennings. \xe2\x80\x9cWould\r\n_you_ disclose to another person what had dropped unconsciously from\r\nthe lips of your suffering patient and your helpless friend, without\r\nfirst knowing that there was a necessity to justify you in opening your\r\nlips?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that he was unanswerable, here; but I tried to argue the\r\nquestion, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy conduct in such a delicate matter as you describe,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould depend greatly on whether the disclosure was of a nature to\r\ncompromise my friend or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have disposed of all necessity for considering that side of the\r\nquestion, long since,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ezra Jennings. \xe2\x80\x9cWherever my notes included\r\nanything which Mr. Candy might have wished to keep secret, those notes\r\nhave been destroyed. My manuscript experiments at my friend\xe2\x80\x99s bedside,\r\ninclude nothing, now, which he would have hesitated to communicate to\r\nothers, if he had recovered the use of his memory. In your case, I have\r\nevery reason to suppose that my notes contain something which he\r\nactually wished to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, you hesitate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, I hesitate. Remember the circumstances under which I obtained\r\nthe information which I possess! Harmless as it is, I cannot prevail\r\nupon myself to give it up to you, unless you first satisfy me that\r\nthere is a reason for doing so. He was so miserably ill, Mr. Blake! and\r\nhe was so helplessly dependent upon Me! Is it too much to ask, if I\r\nrequest you only to hint to me what your interest is in the lost\r\nrecollection\xe2\x80\x94or what you believe that lost recollection to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo have answered him with the frankness which his language and his\r\nmanner both claimed from me, would have been to commit myself to openly\r\nacknowledging that I was suspected of the theft of the Diamond.\r\nStrongly as Ezra Jennings had intensified the first impulsive interest\r\nwhich I had felt in him, he had not overcome my unconquerable\r\nreluctance to disclose the degrading position in which I stood. I took\r\nrefuge once more in the explanatory phrases with which I had prepared\r\nmyself to meet the curiosity of strangers.\r\n\r\nThis time I had no reason to complain of a want of attention on the\r\npart of the person to whom I addressed myself. Ezra Jennings listened\r\npatiently, even anxiously, until I had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have raised your expectations, Mr. Blake, only to\r\ndisappoint them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout the whole period of Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness, from first to last, not one word about the Diamond escaped his\r\nlips. The matter with which I heard him connect your name has, I can\r\nassure you, no discoverable relation whatever with the loss or the\r\nrecovery of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s jewel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe arrived, as he said those words, at a place where the highway along\r\nwhich we had been walking branched off into two roads. One led to Mr.\r\nAblewhite\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the other to a moorland village some two or\r\nthree miles off. Ezra Jennings stopped at the road which led to the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy way lies in this direction,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am really and truly sorry,\r\nMr. Blake, that I can be of no use to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice told me that he spoke sincerely. His soft brown eyes rested\r\non me for a moment with a look of melancholy interest. He bowed, and\r\nwent, without another word, on his way to the village.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or more I stood and watched him, walking farther and\r\nfarther away from me; carrying farther and farther away with him what I\r\nnow firmly believed to be the clue of which I was in search. He turned,\r\nafter walking on a little way, and looked back. Seeing me still\r\nstanding at the place where we had parted, he stopped, as if doubting\r\nwhether I might not wish to speak to him again. There was no time for\r\nme to reason out my own situation\xe2\x80\x94to remind myself that I was losing my\r\nopportunity, at what might be the turning point of my life, and all to\r\nflatter nothing more important than my own self-esteem! There was only\r\ntime to call him back first, and to think afterwards. I suspect I am\r\none of the rashest of existing men. I called him back\xe2\x80\x94and then I said\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x9cNow there is no help for it. I must tell him the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps directly. I advanced along the road to meet him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jennings,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not treated you quite fairly. My\r\ninterest in tracing Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s lost recollection is not the interest\r\nof recovering the Moonstone. A serious personal matter is at the bottom\r\nof my visit to Yorkshire. I have but one excuse for not having dealt\r\nfrankly with you in this matter. It is more painful to me than I can\r\nsay, to mention to anybody what my position really is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings looked at me with the first appearance of embarrassment\r\nwhich I had seen in him yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no right, Mr. Blake, and no wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto intrude myself\r\ninto your private affairs. Allow me to ask your pardon, on my side, for\r\nhaving (most innocently) put you to a painful test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a perfect right,\xe2\x80\x9d I rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cto fix the terms on which you\r\nfeel justified in revealing what you heard at Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. I\r\nunderstand and respect the delicacy which influences you in this\r\nmatter. How can I expect to be taken into your confidence if I decline\r\nto admit you into mine? You ought to know, and you shall know, why I am\r\ninterested in discovering what Mr. Candy wanted to say to me. If I turn\r\nout to be mistaken in my anticipations, and if you prove unable to help\r\nme when you are really aware of what I want, I shall trust to your\r\nhonour to keep my secret\xe2\x80\x94and something tells me that I shall not trust\r\nin vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Mr. Blake. I have a word to say, which must be said before you\r\ngo any farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at him in astonishment. The grip of some terrible emotion\r\nseemed to have seized him, and shaken him to the soul. His gipsy\r\ncomplexion had altered to a livid greyish paleness; his eyes had\r\nsuddenly become wild and glittering; his voice had dropped to a\r\ntone\xe2\x80\x94low, stern, and resolute\xe2\x80\x94which I now heard for the first time. The\r\nlatent resources in the man, for good or for evil\xe2\x80\x94it was hard, at that\r\nmoment, to say which\xe2\x80\x94leapt up in him and showed themselves to me, with\r\nthe suddenness of a flash of light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you place any confidence in me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ought to\r\nknow, and you _must_ know, under what circumstances I have been\r\nreceived into Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s house. It won\xe2\x80\x99t take long. I don\xe2\x80\x99t profess,\r\nsir, to tell my story (as the phrase is) to any man. My story will die\r\nwith me. All I ask, is to be permitted to tell you, what I have told\r\nMr. Candy. If you are still in the mind, when you have heard that, to\r\nsay what you have proposed to say, you will command my attention and\r\ncommand my services. Shall we walk on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suppressed misery in his face silenced me. I answered his question\r\nby a sign. We walked on.\r\n\r\nAfter advancing a few hundred yards, Ezra Jennings stopped at a gap in\r\nthe rough stone wall which shut off the moor from the road, at this\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind resting a little, Mr. Blake?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not what I\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94and some things shake me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI agreed of course. He led the way through the gap to a patch of turf\r\non the heathy ground, screened by bushes and dwarf trees on the side\r\nnearest to the road, and commanding in the opposite direction a grandly\r\ndesolate view over the broad brown wilderness of the moor. The clouds\r\nhad gathered, within the last half hour. The light was dull; the\r\ndistance was dim. The lovely face of Nature met us, soft and still\r\ncolourless\xe2\x80\x94met us without a smile.\r\n\r\nWe sat down in silence. Ezra Jennings laid aside his hat, and passed\r\nhis hand wearily over his forehead, wearily through his startling white\r\nand black hair. He tossed his little nosegay of wild flowers away from\r\nhim, as if the remembrances which it recalled were remembrances which\r\nhurt him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blake!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in bad company. The cloud of a\r\nhorrible accusation has rested on me for years. I tell you the worst at\r\nonce. I am a man whose life is a wreck, and whose character is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI attempted to speak. He stopped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me; not yet. Don\xe2\x80\x99t commit yourself to\r\nexpressions of sympathy which you may afterwards wish to recall. I have\r\nmentioned an accusation which has rested on me for years. There are\r\ncircumstances in connexion with it that tell against me. I cannot bring\r\nmyself to acknowledge what the accusation is. And I am incapable,\r\nperfectly incapable, of proving my innocence. I can only assert my\r\ninnocence. I assert it, sir, on my oath, as a Christian. It is useless\r\nto appeal to my honour as a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again. I looked round at him. He never looked at me in\r\nreturn. His whole being seemed to be absorbed in the agony of\r\nrecollecting, and in the effort to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is much that I might say,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cabout the merciless\r\ntreatment of me by my own family, and the merciless enmity to which I\r\nhave fallen a victim. But the harm is done; the wrong is beyond all\r\nremedy. I decline to weary or distress you, sir, if I can help it. At\r\nthe outset of my career in this country, the vile slander to which I\r\nhave referred struck me down at once and for ever. I resigned my\r\naspirations in my profession\xe2\x80\x94obscurity was the only hope left for me. I\r\nparted with the woman I loved\xe2\x80\x94how could I condemn her to share my\r\ndisgrace? A medical assistant\xe2\x80\x99s place offered itself, in a remote\r\ncorner of England. I got the place. It promised me peace; it promised\r\nme obscurity, as I thought. I was wrong. Evil report, with time and\r\nchance to help it, travels patiently, and travels far. The accusation\r\nfrom which I had fled followed me. I got warning of its approach. I was\r\nable to leave my situation voluntarily, with the testimonials that I\r\nhad earned. They got me another situation in another remote district.\r\nTime passed again; and again the slander that was death to my character\r\nfound me out. On this occasion I had no warning. My employer said, \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nJennings, I have no complaint to make against you; but you must set\r\nyourself right, or leave me.\xe2\x80\x99 I had but one choice\xe2\x80\x94I left him. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuseless to dwell on what I suffered after that. I am only forty years\r\nold now. Look at my face, and let it tell for me the story of some\r\nmiserable years. It ended in my drifting to this place, and meeting\r\nwith Mr. Candy. He wanted an assistant. I referred him, on the question\r\nof capacity, to my last employer. The question of character remained. I\r\ntold him what I have told you\xe2\x80\x94and more. I warned him that there were\r\ndifficulties in the way, even if he believed me. \xe2\x80\x98Here, as elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said \xe2\x80\x98I scorn the guilty evasion of living under an assumed name: I\r\nam no safer at Frizinghall than at other places from the cloud that\r\nfollows me, go where I may.\xe2\x80\x99 He answered, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t do things by\r\nhalves\xe2\x80\x94I believe you, and I pity you. If _you_ will risk what may\r\nhappen, _I_ will risk it too.\xe2\x80\x99 God Almighty bless him! He has given me\r\nshelter, he has given me employment, he has given me rest of mind\xe2\x80\x94and I\r\nhave the certain conviction (I have had it for some months past) that\r\nnothing will happen now to make him regret it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe slander has died out?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe slander is as active as ever. But when it follows me here, it will\r\ncome too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have left the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x94I shall be dead. For ten years past I have suffered from\r\nan incurable internal complaint. I don\xe2\x80\x99t disguise from you that I\r\nshould have let the agony of it kill me long since, but for one last\r\ninterest in life, which makes my existence of some importance to me\r\nstill. I want to provide for a person\xe2\x80\x94very dear to me\xe2\x80\x94whom I shall\r\nnever see again. My own little patrimony is hardly sufficient to make\r\nher independent of the world. The hope, if I could only live long\r\nenough, of increasing it to a certain sum, has impelled me to resist\r\nthe disease by such palliative means as I could devise. The one\r\neffectual palliative in my case, is\xe2\x80\x94opium. To that all-potent and\r\nall-merciful drug I am indebted for a respite of many years from my\r\nsentence of death. But even the virtues of opium have their limit. The\r\nprogress of the disease has gradually forced me from the use of opium\r\nto the abuse of it. I am feeling the penalty at last. My nervous system\r\nis shattered; my nights are nights of horror. The end is not far off\r\nnow. Let it come\xe2\x80\x94I have not lived and worked in vain. The little sum is\r\nnearly made up; and I have the means of completing it, if my last\r\nreserves of life fail me sooner than I expect. I hardly know how I have\r\nwandered into telling you this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am mean enough to\r\nappeal to your pity. Perhaps, I fancy you may be all the readier to\r\nbelieve me, if you know that what I have said to you, I have said with\r\nthe certain knowledge in me that I am a dying man. There is no\r\ndisguising, Mr. Blake, that you interest me. I have attempted to make\r\nmy poor friend\xe2\x80\x99s loss of memory the means of bettering my acquaintance\r\nwith you. I have speculated on the chance of your feeling a passing\r\ncuriosity about what he wanted to say, and of my being able to satisfy\r\nit. Is there no excuse for my intruding myself on you? Perhaps there is\r\nsome excuse. A man who has lived as I have lived has his bitter moments\r\nwhen he ponders over human destiny. You have youth, health, riches, a\r\nplace in the world, a prospect before you. You, and such as you, show\r\nme the sunny side of human life, and reconcile me with the world that I\r\nam leaving, before I go. However this talk between us may end, I shall\r\nnot forget that you have done me a kindness in doing that. It rests\r\nwith you, sir, to say what you proposed saying, or to wish me good\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had but one answer to make to that appeal. Without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhesitation I told him the truth, as unreservedly as I have told it in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\nHe started to his feet, and looked at me with breathless eagerness as I\r\napproached the leading incident of my story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certain that I went into the room,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is certain that\r\nI took the Diamond. I can only meet those two plain facts by declaring\r\nthat, do what I might, I did it without my own knowledge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings caught me excitedly by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have suggested more to me than you suppose. Have\r\n_you_ ever been accustomed to the use of opium?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never tasted it in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere your nerves out of order, at this time last year? Were you\r\nunusually restless and irritable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you sleep badly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretchedly. Many nights I never slept at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the birthday night an exception? Try, and remember. Did you sleep\r\nwell on that one occasion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do remember! I slept soundly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped my arm as suddenly as he had taken it\xe2\x80\x94and looked at me with\r\nthe air of a man whose mind was relieved of the last doubt that rested\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a marked day in your life, and in mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam absolutely certain, Mr. Blake, of one thing\xe2\x80\x94I have got what Mr.\r\nCandy wanted to say to you this morning, in the notes that I took at my\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. Wait! that is not all. I am firmly persuaded that I\r\ncan prove you to have been unconscious of what you were about, when you\r\nentered the room and took the Diamond. Give me time to think, and time\r\nto question you. I believe the vindication of your innocence is in my\r\nhands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of our colloquy, we had walked on a few steps, beyond\r\nthe clump of dwarf trees which had hitherto screened us from view.\r\nBefore Ezra Jennings could answer me, he was hailed from the high road\r\nby a man, in great agitation, who had been evidently on the look-out\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he called back; \xe2\x80\x9cI am coming as fast as I can!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned to me. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an urgent case waiting for me at the village\r\nyonder; I ought to have been there half an hour since\xe2\x80\x94I must attend to\r\nit at once. Give me two hours from this time, and call at Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94and I will engage to be ready for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to wait!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you quiet my mind\r\nby a word of explanation before we part?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is far too serious a matter to be explained in a hurry, Mr.\r\nBlake. I am not wilfully trying your patience\xe2\x80\x94I should only be adding\r\nto your suspense, if I attempted to relieve it as things are now. At\r\nFrizinghall, sir, in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man on the high road hailed him again. He hurried away, and left\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHow the interval of suspense in which I was now condemned might have\r\naffected other men in my position, I cannot pretend to say. The\r\ninfluence of the two hours\xe2\x80\x99 probation upon _my_ temperament was simply\r\nthis. I felt physically incapable of remaining still in any one place,\r\nand morally incapable of speaking to any one human being, until I had\r\nfirst heard all that Ezra Jennings had to say to me.\r\n\r\nIn this frame of mind, I not only abandoned my contemplated visit to\r\nMrs. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x94I even shrank from encountering Gabriel Betteredge\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nReturning to Frizinghall, I left a note for Betteredge, telling him\r\nthat I had been unexpectedly called away for a few hours, but that he\r\nmight certainly expect me to return towards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon. I requested him, in the interval, to order his dinner at the\r\nusual hour, and to amuse himself as he pleased. He had, as I well knew,\r\nhosts of friends in Frizinghall; and he would be at no loss how to fill\r\nup his time until I returned to the hotel.\r\n\r\nThis done, I made the best of my way out of the town again, and roamed\r\nthe lonely moorland country which surrounds Frizinghall, until my watch\r\ntold me that it was time, at last, to return to Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nI found Ezra Jennings ready and waiting for me.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting alone in a bare little room, which communicated by a\r\nglazed door with a surgery. Hideous coloured diagrams of the ravages of\r\nhideous diseases decorated the barren buff-coloured walls. A bookcase\r\nfilled with dingy medical works, and ornamented at the top with a\r\nskull, in place of the customary bust; a large deal table copiously\r\nsplashed with ink; wooden chairs of the sort that are seen in kitchens\r\nand cottages; a threadbare drugget in the middle of the floor; a sink\r\nof water, with a basin and waste-pipe roughly let into the wall,\r\nhorribly suggestive of its connection with surgical\r\noperations\xe2\x80\x94comprised the entire furniture of the room. The bees were\r\nhumming among a few flowers placed in pots outside the window; the\r\nbirds were singing in the garden, and the faint intermittent jingle of\r\na tuneless piano in some neighbouring house forced itself now and again\r\non the ear. In any other place, these everyday sounds might have spoken\r\npleasantly of the everyday world outside. Here, they came in as\r\nintruders on a silence which nothing but human suffering had the\r\nprivilege to disturb. I looked at the mahogany instrument case, and at\r\nthe huge roll of lint, occupying places of their own on the\r\nbookshelves, and shuddered inwardly as I thought of the sounds,\r\nfamiliar and appropriate to the everyday use of Ezra Jennings\xe2\x80\x99 room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no apology, Mr. Blake, for the place in which I am receiving\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the only room in the house, at this hour of the\r\nday, in which we can feel quite sure of being left undisturbed. Here\r\nare my papers ready for you; and here are two books to which we may\r\nhave occasion to refer, before we have done. Bring your chair to the\r\ntable, and we shall be able to consult them together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI drew up to the table; and Ezra Jennings handed me his manuscript\r\nnotes. They consisted of two large folio leaves of paper. One leaf\r\ncontained writing which only covered the surface at intervals. The\r\nother presented writing, in red and black ink, which completely filled\r\nthe page from top to bottom. In the irritated state of my curiosity, at\r\nthat moment, I laid aside the second sheet of paper in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what I am to expect, before I\r\nattempt to read this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly, Mr. Blake! Do you mind my asking you one or two more\r\nquestions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me anything you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with the sad smile on his lips, and the kindly interest\r\nin his soft brown eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already told me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have never\xe2\x80\x94to your\r\nknowledge\xe2\x80\x94tasted opium in your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will understand directly why I speak with that reservation. Let us\r\ngo on. You are not aware of ever having taken opium. At this time, last\r\nyear, you were suffering from nervous irritation, and you slept\r\nwretchedly at night. On the night of the birthday, however, there was\r\nan exception to the rule\xe2\x80\x94you slept soundly. Am I right, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you assign any cause for the nervous suffering, and your want of\r\nsleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can assign no cause. Old Betteredge made a guess at the cause, I\r\nremember. But that is hardly worth mentioning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me. Anything is worth mentioning in such a case as this.\r\nBetteredge attributed your sleeplessness to something. To what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my leaving off smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you been an habitual smoker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you leave off the habit suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge was perfectly right, Mr. Blake. When smoking is a habit a\r\nman must have no common constitution who can leave it off suddenly\r\nwithout some temporary damage to his nervous system. Your sleepless\r\nnights are accounted for, to my mind. My next question refers to Mr.\r\nCandy. Do you remember having entered into anything like a dispute with\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94at the birthday dinner, or afterwards\xe2\x80\x94on the subject of his\r\nprofession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question instantly awakened one of my dormant remembrances in\r\nconnection with the birthday festival. The foolish wrangle which took\r\nplace, on that occasion, between Mr. Candy and myself, will be found\r\ndescribed at much greater length than it deserves in the tenth chapter\r\nof Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s Narrative. The details there presented of the\r\ndispute\xe2\x80\x94so little had I thought of it afterwards\xe2\x80\x94entirely failed to\r\nrecur to my memory. All that I could now recall, and all that I could\r\ntell Ezra Jennings was, that I had attacked the art of medicine at the\r\ndinner-table with sufficient rashness and sufficient pertinacity to put\r\neven Mr. Candy out of temper for the moment. I also remembered that\r\nLady Verinder had interfered to stop the dispute, and that the little\r\ndoctor and I had \xe2\x80\x9cmade it up again,\xe2\x80\x9d as the children say, and had\r\nbecome as good friends as ever, before we shook hands that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ezra Jennings, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich it is very\r\nimportant I should know. Had you any reason for feeling any special\r\nanxiety about the Diamond, at this time last year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the strongest reasons for feeling anxiety about the Diamond. I\r\nknew it to be the object of a conspiracy; and I was warned to take\r\nmeasures for Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s protection, as the possessor of the\r\nstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the safety of the Diamond the subject of conversation between you\r\nand any other person, immediately before you retired to rest on the\r\nbirthday night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the subject of a conversation between Lady Verinder and her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich took place in your hearing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings took up his notes from the table, and placed them in my\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you read those notes now, by the light which\r\nmy questions and your answers have thrown on them, you will make two\r\nastounding discoveries concerning yourself. You will find:\xe2\x80\x94First, that\r\nyou entered Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room and took the Diamond, in a\r\nstate of trance, produced by opium. Secondly, that the opium was given\r\nto you by Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x94without your own knowledge\xe2\x80\x94as a practical\r\nrefutation of the opinions which you had expressed to him at the\r\nbirthday dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat with the papers in my hand completely stupefied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and forgive poor Mr. Candy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the assistant gently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has\r\ndone dreadful mischief, I own; but he has done it innocently. If you\r\nwill look at the notes, you will see that\xe2\x80\x94but for his illness\xe2\x80\x94he would\r\nhave returned to Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s the morning after the party, and would\r\nhave acknowledged the trick that he had played you. Miss Verinder would\r\nhave heard of it, and Miss Verinder would have questioned him\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\ntruth which has laid hidden for a year would have been discovered in a\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to regain my self-possession. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Candy is beyond the reach of\r\nmy resentment,\xe2\x80\x9d I said angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the trick that he played me is not\r\nthe less an act of treachery, for all that. I may forgive, but I shall\r\nnot forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery medical man commits that act of treachery, Mr. Blake, in the\r\ncourse of his practice. The ignorant distrust of opium (in England) is\r\nby no means confined to the lower and less cultivated classes. Every\r\ndoctor in large practice finds himself, every now and then, obliged to\r\ndeceive his patients, as Mr. Candy deceived you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t defend the\r\nfolly of playing you a trick under the circumstances. I only plead with\r\nyou for a more accurate and more merciful construction of motives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it done?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWho gave me the laudanum, without my\r\nknowing it myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not able to tell you. Nothing relating to that part of the matter\r\ndropped from Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s lips, all through his illness. Perhaps your\r\nown memory may point to the person to be suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless, in that case, to pursue the inquiry. The laudanum was\r\nsecretly given to you in some way. Let us leave it there, and go on to\r\nmatters of more immediate importance. Read my notes, if you can.\r\nFamiliarise your mind with what has happened in the past. I have\r\nsomething very bold and very startling to propose to you, which relates\r\nto the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose last words roused me.\r\n\r\nI looked at the papers, in the order in which Ezra Jennings had placed\r\nthem in my hands. The paper which contained the smaller quantity of\r\nwriting was the uppermost of the two. On this, the disconnected words,\r\nand fragments of sentences, which had dropped from Mr. Candy in his\r\ndelirium, appeared as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... Mr. Franklin Blake ... and agreeable ... down a peg ... medicine\r\n... confesses ... sleep at night ... tell him ... out of order ...\r\nmedicine ... he tells me ... and groping in the dark mean one and the\r\nsame thing ... all the company at the dinner-table ... I say ...\r\ngroping after sleep ... nothing but medicine ... he says ... leading\r\nthe blind ... know what it means ... witty ... a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest in spite\r\nof his teeth ... wants sleep ... Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s medicine chest ...\r\nfive-and-twenty minims ... without his knowing it ... tomorrow morning\r\n... Well, Mr. Blake ... medicine today ... never ... without it ...\r\nout, Mr. Candy ... excellent ... without it ... down on him ... truth\r\n... something besides ... excellent ... dose of laudanum, sir ... bed\r\n... what ... medicine now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere, the first of the two sheets of paper came to an end. I handed it\r\nback to Ezra Jennings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what you heard at his bedside?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiterally and exactly what I heard,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept that the\r\nrepetitions are not transferred here from my short-hand notes. He\r\nreiterated certain words and phrases a dozen times over, fifty times\r\nover, just as he attached more or less importance to the idea which\r\nthey represented. The repetitions, in this sense, were of some\r\nassistance to me in putting together those fragments. Don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe added, pointing to the second sheet of paper, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I claim to have\r\nreproduced the expressions which Mr. Candy himself would have used if\r\nhe had been capable of speaking connectedly. I only say that I have\r\npenetrated through the obstacle of the disconnected expression, to the\r\nthought which was underlying it connectedly all the time. Judge for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned to the second sheet of paper, which I now knew to be the key\r\nto the first.\r\n\r\nOnce more, Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s wanderings appeared, copied in black ink; the\r\nintervals between the phrases being filled up by Ezra Jennings in red\r\nink. I reproduce the result here, in one plain form; the original\r\nlanguage and the interpretation of it coming close enough together in\r\nthese pages to be easily compared and verified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... Mr. Franklin Blake is clever and agreeable, but he wants taking\r\ndown a peg when he talks of medicine. He confesses that he has been\r\nsuffering from want of sleep at night. I tell him that his nerves are\r\nout of order, and that he ought to take medicine. He tells me that\r\ntaking medicine and groping in the dark mean one and the same thing.\r\nThis before all the company at the dinner-table. I say to him, you are\r\ngroping after sleep, and nothing but medicine can help you to find it.\r\nHe says to me, I have heard of the blind leading the blind, and now I\r\nknow what it means. Witty\xe2\x80\x94but I can give him a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest in spite of\r\nhis teeth. He really wants sleep; and Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s medicine chest is\r\nat my disposal. Give him five-and-twenty minims of laudanum tonight,\r\nwithout his knowing it; and then call tomorrow morning. \xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr.\r\nBlake, will you try a little medicine today? You will never sleep\r\nwithout it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98There you are out, Mr. Candy: I have had an excellent\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s rest without it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, come down on him with the truth! \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nhave had something besides an excellent night\xe2\x80\x99s rest; you had a dose of\r\nlaudanum, sir, before you went to bed. What do you say to the art of\r\nmedicine, now?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdmiration of the ingenuity which had woven this smooth and finished\r\ntexture out of the ravelled skein was naturally the first impression\r\nthat I felt, on handing the manuscript back to Ezra Jennings. He\r\nmodestly interrupted the first few words in which my sense of surprise\r\nexpressed itself, by asking me if the conclusion which he had drawn\r\nfrom his notes was also the conclusion at which my own mind had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe as I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were acting under the\r\ninfluence of the laudanum in doing all that you did, on the night of\r\nMiss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, in Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too ignorant of the influence of laudanum to have an opinion of\r\nmy own,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only follow your opinion, and feel\r\nconvinced that you are right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. The next question is this. You are convinced; and I am\r\nconvinced\xe2\x80\x94how are we to carry our conviction to the minds of other\r\npeople?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pointed to the two manuscripts, lying on the table between us. Ezra\r\nJennings shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUseless, Mr. Blake! Quite useless, as they stand now for three\r\nunanswerable reasons. In the first place, those notes have been taken\r\nunder circumstances entirely out of the experience of the mass of\r\nmankind. Against them, to begin with! In the second place, those notes\r\nrepresent a medical and metaphysical theory. Against them, once more!\r\nIn the third place, those notes are of _my_ making; there is nothing\r\nbut _my_ assertion to the contrary, to guarantee that they are not\r\nfabrications. Remember what I told you on the moor\xe2\x80\x94and ask yourself\r\nwhat my assertion is worth. No! my notes have but one value, looking to\r\nthe verdict of the world outside. Your innocence is to be vindicated;\r\nand they show how it can be done. We must put our conviction to the\r\nproof\xe2\x80\x94and You are the man to prove it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe leaned eagerly nearer to me across the table that divided us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you willing to try a bold experiment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do anything to clear myself of the suspicion that rests on me\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you submit to some personal inconvenience for a time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo any inconvenience, no matter what it may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be guided implicitly by my advice? It may expose you to the\r\nridicule of fools; it may subject you to the remonstrances of friends\r\nwhose opinions you are bound to respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what to do!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke out impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, come what may,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall do this, Mr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall steal the\r\nDiamond, unconsciously, for the second time, in the presence of\r\nwitnesses whose testimony is beyond dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI started to my feet. I tried to speak. I could only look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it _can_ be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it _shall_ be done\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nyou will only help me. Try to compose yourself\xe2\x80\x94sit down, and hear what\r\nI have to say to you. You have resumed the habit of smoking; I have\r\nseen that for myself. How long have you resumed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor nearly a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you smoke more or less than you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give up the habit again? Suddenly, mind!\xe2\x80\x94as you gave it up\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began dimly to see his drift. \xe2\x80\x9cI will give it up, from this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the same consequences follow, which followed last June,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ezra\r\nJennings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif you suffer once more as you suffered then, from sleepless\r\nnights, we shall have gained our first step. We shall have put you back\r\nagain into something assimilating to your nervous condition on the\r\nbirthday night. If we can next revive, or nearly revive, the domestic\r\ncircumstances which surrounded you; and if we can occupy your mind\r\nagain with the various questions concerning the Diamond which formerly\r\nagitated it, we shall have replaced you, as nearly as possible in the\r\nsame position, physically and morally, in which the opium found you\r\nlast year. In that case we may fairly hope that a repetition of the\r\ndose will lead, in a greater or lesser degree, to a repetition of the\r\nresult. There is my proposal, expressed in a few hasty words. You shall\r\nnow see what reasons I have to justify me in making it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to one of the books at his side, and opened it at a place\r\nmarked by a small slip of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I am going to weary you with a lecture on\r\nphysiology,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think myself bound to prove, in justice to\r\nboth of us, that I am not asking you to try this experiment in\r\ndeference to any theory of my own devising. Admitted principles, and\r\nrecognised authorities, justify me in the view that I take. Give me\r\nfive minutes of your attention; and I will undertake to show you that\r\nScience sanctions my proposal, fanciful as it may seem. Here, in the\r\nfirst place, is the physiological principle on which I am acting,\r\nstated by no less a person than Dr. Carpenter. Read it for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed me the slip of paper which had marked the place in the book.\r\nIt contained a few lines of writing, as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems much ground for the belief, that _every_ sensory\r\nimpression which has once been recognised by the perceptive\r\nconsciousness, is registered (so to speak) in the brain, and may be\r\nreproduced at some subsequent time, although there may be no\r\nconsciousness of its existence in the mind during the whole\r\nintermediate period.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that plain, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ezra Jennings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed the open book across the table to me, and pointed to a\r\npassage, marked by pencil lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cread that account of a case, which has\xe2\x80\x94as I believe\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndirect bearing on your own position, and on the experiment which I am\r\ntempting you to try. Observe, Mr. Blake, before you begin, that I am\r\nnow referring you to one of the greatest of English physiologists. The\r\nbook in your hand is Doctor Elliotson\xe2\x80\x99s _Human Physiology_; and the\r\ncase which the doctor cites rests on the well-known authority of Mr.\r\nCombe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe passage pointed out to me was expressed in these terms:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. Abel informed me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Combe, \xe2\x80\x9cof an Irish porter to a\r\nwarehouse, who forgot, when sober, what he had done when drunk; but,\r\nbeing drunk, again recollected the transactions of his former state of\r\nintoxication. On one occasion, being drunk, he had lost a parcel of\r\nsome value, and in his sober moments could give no account of it. Next\r\ntime he was intoxicated, he recollected that he had left the parcel at\r\na certain house, and there being no address on it, it had remained\r\nthere safely, and was got on his calling for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlain again?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ezra Jennings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs plain as need be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put back the slip of paper in its place, and closed the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied that I have not spoken without good authority to\r\nsupport me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not, I have only to go to those bookshelves,\r\nand you have only to read the passages which I can point out to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout reading a word more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, we may return to your own personal interest in this\r\nmatter. I am bound to tell you that there is something to be said\r\nagainst the experiment as well as for it. If we could, this year,\r\nexactly reproduce, in your case, the conditions as they existed last\r\nyear, it is physiologically certain that we should arrive at exactly\r\nthe same result. But this\xe2\x80\x94there is no denying it\xe2\x80\x94is simply impossible.\r\nWe can only hope to approximate to the conditions; and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsucceed in getting you nearly enough back to what you were, this\r\nventure of ours will fail. If we do succeed\xe2\x80\x94and I am myself hopeful of\r\nsuccess\xe2\x80\x94you may at least so far repeat your proceedings on the birthday\r\nnight, as to satisfy any reasonable person that you are guiltless,\r\nmorally speaking, of the theft of the Diamond. I believe, Mr. Blake, I\r\nhave now stated the question, on both sides of it, as fairly as I can,\r\nwithin the limits that I have imposed on myself. If there is anything\r\nthat I have not made clear to you, tell me what it is\xe2\x80\x94and if I can\r\nenlighten you, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that you have explained to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI understand perfectly.\r\nBut I own I am puzzled on one point, which you have not made clear to\r\nme yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the point?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the effect of the laudanum on me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand my walking downstairs, and along corridors, and my opening\r\nand shutting the drawers of a cabinet, and my going back again to my\r\nown room. All these are active proceedings. I thought the influence of\r\nopium was first to stupefy you, and then to send you to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe common error about opium, Mr. Blake! I am, at this moment,\r\nexerting my intelligence (such as it is) in your service, under the\r\ninfluence of a dose of laudanum, some ten times larger than the dose\r\nMr. Candy administered to you. But don\xe2\x80\x99t trust to my authority\xe2\x80\x94even on\r\na question which comes within my own personal experience. I anticipated\r\nthe objection you have just made: and I have again provided myself with\r\nindependent testimony which will carry its due weight with it in your\r\nown mind, and in the minds of your friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed me the second of the two books which he had by him on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care the far-famed _Confessions of an English Opium\r\nEater_! Take the book away with you, and read it. At the passage which\r\nI have marked, you will find that when De Quincey had committed what he\r\ncalls \xe2\x80\x98a debauch of opium,\xe2\x80\x99 he either went to the gallery at the Opera\r\nto enjoy the music, or he wandered about the London markets on Saturday\r\nnight, and interested himself in observing all the little shifts and\r\nbargainings of the poor in providing their Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s dinner. So much for\r\nthe capacity of a man to occupy himself actively, and to move about\r\nfrom place to place under the influence of opium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am answered so far,\xe2\x80\x9d I said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not answered yet as to the\r\neffect produced by the opium on myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to answer you in a few words,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ezra Jennings. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\naction of opium is comprised, in the majority of cases, in two\r\ninfluences\xe2\x80\x94a stimulating influence first, and a sedative influence\r\nafterwards. Under the stimulating influence, the latest and most vivid\r\nimpressions left on your mind\xe2\x80\x94namely, the impressions relating to the\r\nDiamond\xe2\x80\x94would be likely, in your morbidly sensitive nervous condition,\r\nto become intensified in your brain, and would subordinate to\r\nthemselves your judgment and your will exactly as an ordinary dream\r\nsubordinates to itself your judgment and your will. Little by little,\r\nunder this action, any apprehensions about the safety of the Diamond\r\nwhich you might have felt during the day would be liable to develop\r\nthemselves from the state of doubt to the state of certainty\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nimpel you into practical action to preserve the jewel\xe2\x80\x94would direct your\r\nsteps, with that motive in view, into the room which you entered\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwould guide your hand to the drawers of the cabinet, until you had\r\nfound the drawer which held the stone. In the spiritualised\r\nintoxication of opium, you would do all that. Later, as the sedative\r\naction began to gain on the stimulant action, you would slowly become\r\ninert and stupefied. Later still you would fall into a deep sleep. When\r\nthe morning came, and the effect of the opium had been all slept off,\r\nyou would wake as absolutely ignorant of what you had done in the night\r\nas if you had been living at the Antipodes. Have I made it tolerably\r\nclear to you so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made it so clear,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I want you to go farther.\r\nYou have shown me how I entered the room, and how I came to take the\r\nDiamond. But Miss Verinder saw me leave the room again, with the jewel\r\nin my hand. Can you trace my proceedings from that moment? Can you\r\nguess what I did next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the very point I was coming to,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a\r\nquestion with me whether the experiment which I propose as a means of\r\nvindicating your innocence, may not also be made a means of recovering\r\nthe lost Diamond as well. When you left Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room,\r\nwith the jewel in your hand, you went back in all probability to your\r\nown room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes? and what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible, Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x94I dare not say more\xe2\x80\x94that your idea of\r\npreserving the Diamond led, by a natural sequence, to the idea of\r\nhiding the Diamond, and that the place in which you hid it was\r\nsomewhere in your bedroom. In that event, the case of the Irish porter\r\nmay be your case. You may remember, under the influence of the second\r\ndose of opium, the place in which you hid the Diamond under the\r\ninfluence of the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was my turn, now, to enlighten Ezra Jennings. I stopped him, before\r\nhe could say any more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speculating,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9con a result which cannot possibly take\r\nplace. The Diamond is, at this moment, in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started, and looked at me in great surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn London?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did it get to London from Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou removed it with your own hand from Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s room. How was\r\nit taken out of your keeping?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea how it was taken out of my keeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see it, when you woke in the morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Miss Verinder recovered possession of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blake! there seems to be something here which wants clearing up.\r\nMay I ask how you know that the Diamond is, at this moment, in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had put precisely the same question to Mr. Bruff when I made my first\r\ninquiries about the Moonstone, on my return to England. In answering\r\nEzra Jennings, I accordingly repeated what I had myself heard from the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s own lips\xe2\x80\x94and what is already familiar to the readers of these\r\npages.\r\n\r\nHe showed plainly that he was not satisfied with my reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all deference to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand with all deference to your\r\nlegal adviser, I maintain the opinion which I expressed just now. It\r\nrests, I am well aware, on a mere assumption. Pardon me for reminding\r\nyou, that your opinion also rests on a mere assumption as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe view he took of the matter was entirely new to me. I waited\r\nanxiously to hear how he would defend it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ assume,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Ezra Jennings, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the influence of the\r\nopium\xe2\x80\x94after impelling you to possess yourself of the Diamond, with the\r\npurpose of securing its safety\xe2\x80\x94might also impel you, acting under the\r\nsame influence and the same motive, to hide it somewhere in your own\r\nroom. _You_ assume that the Hindoo conspirators could by no possibility\r\ncommit a mistake. The Indians went to Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s house after the\r\nDiamond\xe2\x80\x94and, therefore, in Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s possession the Diamond must be!\r\nHave you any evidence to prove that the Moonstone was taken to London\r\nat all? You can\xe2\x80\x99t even guess how, or by whom, it was removed from Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s house! Have you any evidence that the jewel was pledged to\r\nMr. Luker? He declares that he never heard of the Moonstone; and his\r\nbankers\xe2\x80\x99 receipt acknowledges nothing but the deposit of a valuable of\r\ngreat price. The Indians assume that Mr. Luker is lying\xe2\x80\x94and you assume\r\nagain that the Indians are right. All I say, in differing with you,\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94that my view is possible. What more, Mr. Blake, either logically, or\r\nlegally, can be said for yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was put strongly; but there was no denying that it was put truly as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess you stagger me,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you object to my writing to\r\nMr. Bruff, and telling him what you have said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I shall be glad if you will write to Mr. Bruff. If we\r\nconsult his experience, we may see the matter under a new light. For\r\nthe present, let us return to our experiment with the opium. We have\r\ndecided that you leave off the habit of smoking from this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the first step. The next step is to reproduce, as nearly as we\r\ncan, the domestic circumstances which surrounded you last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow was this to be done? Lady Verinder was dead. Rachel and I, so long\r\nas the suspicion of theft rested on me, were parted irrevocably.\r\nGodfrey Ablewhite was away travelling on the Continent. It was simply\r\nimpossible to reassemble the people who had inhabited the house, when I\r\nhad slept in it last. The statement of this objection did not appear to\r\nembarrass Ezra Jennings. He attached very little importance, he said,\r\nto reassembling the same people\xe2\x80\x94seeing that it would be vain to expect\r\nthem to reassume the various positions which they had occupied towards\r\nme in the past times. On the other hand, he considered it essential to\r\nthe success of the experiment, that I should see the same objects about\r\nme which had surrounded me when I was last in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbove all things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must sleep in the room which you\r\nslept in, on the birthday night, and it must be furnished in the same\r\nway. The stairs, the corridors, and Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, must\r\nalso be restored to what they were when you saw them last. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary, Mr. Blake, to replace every article of furniture\r\nin that part of the house which may now be put away. The sacrifice of\r\nyour cigars will be useless, unless we can get Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npermission to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is to apply to her for permission?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not possible for _you_ to apply?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite out of the question. After what has passed between us on the\r\nsubject of the lost Diamond, I can neither see her, nor write to her,\r\nas things are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEzra Jennings paused, and considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask you a delicate question?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI signed to him to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I right, Mr. Blake, in fancying (from one or two things which have\r\ndropped from you) that you felt no common interest in Miss Verinder, in\r\nformer times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the feeling returned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Miss Verinder would be likely to feel a strong interest\r\nin the attempt to prove your innocence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, _I_ will write to Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x94if you will give me\r\nleave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTelling her of the proposal that you have made to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTelling her of everything that has passed between us today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that I eagerly accepted the service which he had\r\noffered to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have time to write by today\xe2\x80\x99s post,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at his\r\nwatch. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to lock up your cigars, when you get back to the\r\nhotel! I will call tomorrow morning and hear how you have passed the\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI rose to take leave of him; and attempted to express the grateful\r\nsense of his kindness which I really felt.\r\n\r\nHe pressed my hand gently. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember what I told you on the moor,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can do you this little service, Mr. Blake, I shall feel\r\nit like a last gleam of sunshine, falling on the evening of a long and\r\nclouded day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe parted. It was then the fifteenth of June. The events of the next\r\nten days\xe2\x80\x94everyone of them more or less directly connected with the\r\nexperiment of which I was the passive object\xe2\x80\x94are all placed on record,\r\nexactly as they happened, in the Journal habitually kept by Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistant. In the pages of Ezra Jennings nothing is concealed, and\r\nnothing is forgotten. Let Ezra Jennings tell how the venture with the\r\nopium was tried, and how it ended.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_Extracted from the Journal of Ezra Jennings._\r\n\r\n\r\n1849.\xe2\x80\x94June 15.... With some interruption from patients, and some\r\ninterruption from pain, I finished my letter to Miss Verinder in time\r\nfor today\xe2\x80\x99s post. I failed to make it as short a letter as I could have\r\nwished. But I think I have made it plain. It leaves her entirely\r\nmistress of her own decision. If she consents to assist the experiment,\r\nshe consents of her own free will, and not as a favour to Mr. Franklin\r\nBlake or to me.\r\n\r\nJune 16th.\xe2\x80\x94Rose late, after a dreadful night; the vengeance of\r\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s opium, pursuing me through a series of frightful dreams. At\r\none time I was whirling through empty space with the phantoms of the\r\ndead, friends and enemies together. At another, the one beloved face\r\nwhich I shall never see again, rose at my bedside, hideously\r\nphosphorescent in the black darkness, and glared and grinned at me. A\r\nslight return of the old pain, at the usual time in the early morning,\r\nwas welcome as a change. It dispelled the visions\xe2\x80\x94and it was bearable\r\nbecause it did that.\r\n\r\nMy bad night made it late in the morning, before I could get to Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake. I found him stretched on the sofa, breakfasting on\r\nbrandy and soda water, and a dry biscuit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am beginning, as well as you could possibly wish,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nmiserable, restless night; and a total failure of appetite this\r\nmorning. Exactly what happened last year, when I gave up my cigars. The\r\nsooner I am ready for my second dose of laudanum, the better I shall be\r\npleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it on the earliest possible day,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nmeantime, we must be as careful of your health as we can. If we allow\r\nyou to become exhausted, we shall fail in that way. You must get an\r\nappetite for your dinner. In other words, you must get a ride or a walk\r\nthis morning, in the fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will ride, if they can find me a horse here. By-the-bye, I wrote to\r\nMr. Bruff, yesterday. Have you written to Miss Verinder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94by last night\xe2\x80\x99s post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. We shall have some news worth hearing, to tell each other\r\ntomorrow. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go yet! I have a word to say to you. You appeared to\r\nthink, yesterday, that our experiment with the opium was not likely to\r\nbe viewed very favourably by some of my friends. You were quite right.\r\nI call old Gabriel Betteredge one of my friends; and you will be amused\r\nto hear that he protested strongly when I saw him yesterday. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\ndone a wonderful number of foolish things in the course of your life,\r\nMr. Franklin, but this tops them all!\xe2\x80\x99 There is Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s opinion!\r\nYou will make allowance for his prejudices, I am sure, if you and he\r\nhappen to meet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI left Mr. Blake, to go my rounds among my patients; feeling the better\r\nand the happier even for the short interview that I had had with him.\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret of the attraction that there is for me in this man?\r\nDoes it only mean that I feel the contrast between the frankly kind\r\nmanner in which he has allowed me to become acquainted with him, and\r\nthe merciless dislike and distrust with which I am met by other people?\r\nOr is there really something in him which answers to the yearning that\r\nI have for a little human sympathy\xe2\x80\x94the yearning, which has survived the\r\nsolitude and persecution of many years; which seems to grow keener and\r\nkeener, as the time comes nearer and nearer when I shall endure and\r\nfeel no more? How useless to ask these questions! Mr. Blake has given\r\nme a new interest in life. Let that be enough, without seeking to know\r\nwhat the new interest is.\r\n\r\nJune 17th.\xe2\x80\x94Before breakfast, this morning, Mr. Candy informed me that\r\nhe was going away for a fortnight, on a visit to a friend in the south\r\nof England. He gave me as many special directions, poor fellow, about\r\nthe patients, as if he still had the large practice which he possessed\r\nbefore he was taken ill. The practice is worth little enough now! Other\r\ndoctors have superseded _him;_ and nobody who can help it will employ\r\n_me_.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps fortunate that he is to be away just at this time. He\r\nwould have been mortified if I had not informed him of the experiment\r\nwhich I am going to try with Mr. Blake. And I hardly know what\r\nundesirable results might not have happened, if I had taken him into my\r\nconfidence. Better as it is. Unquestionably, better as it is.\r\n\r\nThe post brought me Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s answer, after Mr. Candy had left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nA charming letter! It gives me the highest opinion of her. There is no\r\nattempt to conceal the interest that she feels in our proceedings. She\r\ntells me, in the prettiest manner, that my letter has satisfied her of\r\nMr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, without the slightest need (so far as she is\r\nconcerned) of putting my assertion to the proof. She even upbraids\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94most undeservedly, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x94for not having divined at the\r\ntime what the true solution of the mystery might really be. The motive\r\nunderlying all this proceeds evidently from something more than a\r\ngenerous eagerness to make atonement for a wrong which she has\r\ninnocently inflicted on another person. It is plain that she has loved\r\nhim, throughout the estrangement between them. In more than one place\r\nthe rapture of discovering that he has deserved to be loved, breaks its\r\nway innocently through the stoutest formalities of pen and ink, and\r\neven defies the stronger restraint still of writing to a stranger. Is\r\nit possible (I ask myself, in reading this delightful letter) that I,\r\nof all men in the world, am chosen to be the means of bringing these\r\ntwo young people together again? My own happiness has been trampled\r\nunder foot; my own love has been torn from me. Shall I live to see a\r\nhappiness of others, which is of my making\xe2\x80\x94a love renewed, which is of\r\nmy bringing back? Oh merciful Death, let me see it before your arms\r\nenfold me, before your voice whispers to me, \xe2\x80\x9cRest at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are two requests contained in the letter. One of them prevents me\r\nfrom showing it to Mr. Franklin Blake. I am authorised to tell him that\r\nMiss Verinder willingly consents to place her house at our disposal;\r\nand, that said, I am desired to add no more.\r\n\r\nSo far, it is easy to comply with her wishes. But the second request\r\nembarrasses me seriously.\r\n\r\nNot content with having written to Mr. Betteredge, instructing him to\r\ncarry out whatever directions I may have to give, Miss Verinder asks\r\nleave to assist me, by personally superintending the restoration of her\r\nown sitting-room. She only waits a word of reply from me to make the\r\njourney to Yorkshire, and to be present as one of the witnesses on the\r\nnight when the opium is tried for the second time.\r\n\r\nHere, again, there is a motive under the surface; and, here again, I\r\nfancy that I can find it out.\r\n\r\nWhat she has forbidden me to tell Mr. Franklin Blake, she is (as I\r\ninterpret it) eager to tell him with her own lips, _before_ he is put\r\nto the test which is to vindicate his character in the eyes of other\r\npeople. I understand and admire this generous anxiety to acquit him,\r\nwithout waiting until his innocence may, or may not, be proved. It is\r\nthe atonement that she is longing to make, poor girl, after having\r\ninnocently and inevitably wronged him. But the thing cannot be done. I\r\nhave no sort of doubt that the agitation which a meeting between them\r\nwould produce on both sides\xe2\x80\x94reviving dormant feelings, appealing to old\r\nmemories, awakening new hopes\xe2\x80\x94would, in their effect on the mind of Mr.\r\nBlake, be almost certainly fatal to the success of our experiment. It\r\nis hard enough, as things are, to reproduce in him the conditions as\r\nthey existed, or nearly as they existed, last year. With new interests\r\nand new emotions to agitate him, the attempt would be simply useless.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, knowing this, I cannot find it in my heart to disappoint her.\r\nI must try if I can discover some new arrangement, before post-time,\r\nwhich will allow me to say Yes to Miss Verinder, without damage to the\r\nservice which I have bound myself to render to Mr. Franklin Blake.\r\n\r\nTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94I have just returned from my round of medical visits;\r\nhaving begun, of course, by calling at the hotel.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s report of the night is the same as before. He has had some\r\nintervals of broken sleep, and no more. But he feels it less today,\r\nhaving slept after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s dinner. This after-dinner sleep is the\r\nresult, no doubt, of the ride which I advised him to take. I fear I\r\nshall have to curtail his restorative exercise in the fresh air. He\r\nmust not be too well; he must not be too ill. It is a case (as a sailor\r\nwould say) of very fine steering.\r\n\r\nHe has not heard yet from Mr. Bruff. I found him eager to know if I had\r\nreceived any answer from Miss Verinder.\r\n\r\nI told him exactly what I was permitted to tell, and no more. It was\r\nquite needless to invent excuses for not showing him the letter. He\r\ntold me bitterly enough, poor fellow, that he understood the delicacy\r\nwhich disinclined me to produce it. \xe2\x80\x9cShe consents, of course, as a\r\nmatter of common courtesy and common justice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she keeps\r\nher own opinion of me, and waits to see the result.\xe2\x80\x9d I was sorely\r\ntempted to hint that he was now wronging her as she had wronged him. On\r\nreflection, I shrank from forestalling her in the double luxury of\r\nsurprising and forgiving him.\r\n\r\nMy visit was a very short one. After the experience of the other night,\r\nI have been compelled once more to give up my dose of opium. As a\r\nnecessary result, the agony of the disease that is in me has got the\r\nupper hand again. I felt the attack coming on, and left abruptly, so as\r\nnot to alarm or distress him. It only lasted a quarter of an hour this\r\ntime, and it left me strength enough to go on with my work.\r\n\r\nFive o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94I have written my reply to Miss Verinder.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement I have proposed reconciles the interests on both sides,\r\nif she will only consent to it. After first stating the objections that\r\nthere are to a meeting between Mr. Blake and herself, before the\r\nexperiment is tried, I have suggested that she should so time her\r\njourney as to arrive at the house privately, on the evening when we\r\nmake the attempt. Travelling by the afternoon train from London, she\r\nwould delay her arrival until nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. At that hour, I have\r\nundertaken to see Mr. Blake safely into his bedchamber; and so to leave\r\nMiss Verinder free to occupy her own rooms until the time comes for\r\nadministering the laudanum. When that has been done, there can be no\r\nobjection to her watching the result, with the rest of us. On the next\r\nmorning, she shall show Mr. Blake (if she likes) her correspondence\r\nwith me, and shall satisfy him in that way that he was acquitted in her\r\nestimation, before the question of his innocence was put to the proof.\r\n\r\nIn that sense, I have written to her. This is all that I can do today.\r\nTomorrow I must see Mr. Betteredge, and give the necessary directions\r\nfor re-opening the house.\r\n\r\nJune 18th.\xe2\x80\x94Late again, in calling on Mr. Franklin Blake. More of that\r\nhorrible pain in the early morning; followed, this time, by complete\r\nprostration, for some hours. I foresee, in spite of the penalties which\r\nit exacts from me, that I shall have to return to the opium for the\r\nhundredth time. If I had only myself to think of, I should prefer the\r\nsharp pains to the frightful dreams. But the physical suffering\r\nexhausts me. If I let myself sink, it may end in my becoming useless to\r\nMr. Blake at the time when he wants me most.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o\xe2\x80\x99clock before I could get to the hotel today. The\r\nvisit, even in my shattered condition, proved to be a most amusing\r\none\xe2\x80\x94thanks entirely to the presence on the scene of Gabriel Betteredge.\r\n\r\nI found him in the room, when I went in. He withdrew to the window and\r\nlooked out, while I put my first customary question to my patient. Mr.\r\nBlake had slept badly again, and he felt the loss of rest this morning\r\nmore than he had felt it yet.\r\n\r\nI asked next if he had heard from Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\nA letter had reached him that morning. Mr. Bruff expressed the\r\nstrongest disapproval of the course which his friend and client was\r\ntaking under my advice. It was mischievous\xe2\x80\x94for it excited hopes that\r\nmight never be realised. It was quite unintelligible to _his_ mind,\r\nexcept that it looked like a piece of trickery, akin to the trickery of\r\nmesmerism, clairvoyance, and the like. It unsettled Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and it would end in unsettling Miss Verinder herself. He had put\r\nthe case (without mentioning names) to an eminent physician; and the\r\neminent physician had smiled, had shaken his head, and had\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94nothing. On these grounds, Mr. Bruff entered his protest, and left\r\nit there.\r\n\r\nMy next inquiry related to the subject of the Diamond. Had the lawyer\r\nproduced any evidence to prove that the jewel was in London?\r\n\r\nNo, the lawyer had simply declined to discuss the question. He was\r\nhimself satisfied that the Moonstone had been pledged to Mr. Luker. His\r\neminent absent friend, Mr. Murthwaite (whose consummate knowledge of\r\nthe Indian character no one could deny), was satisfied also. Under\r\nthese circumstances, and with the many demands already made on him, he\r\nmust decline entering into any disputes on the subject of evidence.\r\nTime would show; and Mr. Bruff was willing to wait for time.\r\n\r\nIt was quite plain\xe2\x80\x94even if Mr. Blake had not made it plainer still by\r\nreporting the substance of the letter, instead of reading what was\r\nactually written\xe2\x80\x94that distrust of _me_ was at the bottom of all this.\r\nHaving myself foreseen that result, I was neither mortified nor\r\nsurprised. I asked Mr. Blake if his friend\xe2\x80\x99s protest had shaken him. He\r\nanswered emphatically, that it had not produced the slightest effect on\r\nhis mind. I was free after that to dismiss Mr. Bruff from\r\nconsideration\xe2\x80\x94and I did dismiss him accordingly.\r\n\r\nA pause in the talk between us, followed\xe2\x80\x94and Gabriel Betteredge came\r\nout from his retirement at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you favour me with your attention, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, addressing\r\nhimself to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite at your service,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\nBetteredge took a chair and seated himself at the table. He produced a\r\nhuge old-fashioned leather pocket-book, with a pencil of dimensions to\r\nmatch. Having put on his spectacles, he opened the pocket-book, at a\r\nblank page, and addressed himself to me once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have lived,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betteredge, looking at me sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cnigh on fifty\r\nyears in the service of my late lady. I was page-boy before that, in\r\nthe service of the old lord, her father. I am now somewhere between\r\nseventy and eighty years of age\xe2\x80\x94never mind exactly where! I am reckoned\r\nto have got as pretty a knowledge and experience of the world as most\r\nmen. And what does it all end in? It ends, Mr. Ezra Jennings, in a\r\nconjuring trick being performed on Mr. Franklin Blake, by a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassistant with a bottle of laudanum\xe2\x80\x94and by the living jingo, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nappointed, in my old age, to be conjurer\xe2\x80\x99s boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Blake burst out laughing. I attempted to speak. Betteredge held up\r\nhis hand, in token that he had not done yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word, Mr. Jennings!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt don\xe2\x80\x99t want a word, sir, from\r\nyou. I have got my principles, thank God. If an order comes to me,\r\nwhich is own brother to an order come from Bedlam, it don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. So\r\nlong as I get it from my master or mistress, as the case may be, I obey\r\nit. I may have my own opinion, which is also, you will please to\r\nremember, the opinion of Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x94the Great Mr. Bruff!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBetteredge, raising his voice, and shaking his head at me solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t matter; I withdraw my opinion, for all that. My young lady says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do it.\xe2\x80\x99 And I say, \xe2\x80\x98Miss, it shall be done.\xe2\x80\x99 Here I am, with my book\r\nand my pencil\xe2\x80\x94the latter not pointed so well as I could wish, but when\r\nChristians take leave of their senses, who is to expect that pencils\r\nwill keep their points? Give me your orders, Mr. Jennings. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nthem in writing, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m determined not to be behind \xe2\x80\x99em, or before\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em, by so much as a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth. I\xe2\x80\x99m a blind agent\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nam. A blind agent!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Betteredge, with infinite relish of his\r\nown description of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you and I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bring _me_, into it!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Betteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a\r\nmatter of agreement, it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of obedience. Issue your directions,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x94issue your directions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Blake made me a sign to take him at his word. I \xe2\x80\x9cissued my\r\ndirections\xe2\x80\x9d as plainly and as gravely as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish certain parts of the house to be re-opened,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to be\r\nfurnished, exactly as they were furnished at this time last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge gave his imperfectly-pointed pencil a preliminary lick with\r\nhis tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cName the parts, Mr. Jennings!\xe2\x80\x9d he said loftily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, the inner hall, leading to the chief staircase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98First, the inner hall,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Betteredge wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to furnish\r\nthat, sir, as it was furnished last year\xe2\x80\x94to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there was a stuffed buzzard, Mr. Jennings, in the hall last\r\nyear. When the family left, the buzzard was put away with the other\r\nthings. When the buzzard was put away\xe2\x80\x94he burst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will except the buzzard then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge took a note of the exception. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The inner hall to be\r\nfurnished again, as furnished last year. A burst buzzard alone\r\nexcepted.\xe2\x80\x99 Please to go on, Mr. Jennings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carpet to be laid down on the stairs, as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The carpet to be laid down on the stairs, as before.\xe2\x80\x99 Sorry to\r\ndisappoint you, sir. But that can\xe2\x80\x99t be done either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the man who laid that carpet down is dead, Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe like of him for reconciling together a carpet and a corner, is not\r\nto be found in all England, look where you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. We must try the next best man in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge took another note; and I went on issuing my directions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room to be restored exactly to what it was\r\nlast year. Also, the corridor leading from the sitting-room to the\r\nfirst landing. Also, the second corridor, leading from the second\r\nlanding to the best bedrooms. Also, the bedroom occupied last June by\r\nMr. Franklin Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s blunt pencil followed me conscientiously, word by word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with sardonic gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a deal of\r\nwriting left in the point of this pencil yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him that I had no more directions to give. \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBetteredge, \xe2\x80\x9cin that case, I have a point or two to put on my own\r\nbehalf.\xe2\x80\x9d He opened the pocket-book at a new page, and gave the\r\ninexhaustible pencil another preliminary lick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to know,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I may, or may not, wash my\r\nhands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may decidedly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Blake. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for the waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94of certain responsibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Betteredge, impenetrably\r\ndeclining to see anybody in the room but himself and me. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, to begin with. When we took up the carpet last\r\nyear, Mr. Jennings, we found a surprising quantity of pins. Am I\r\nresponsible for putting back the pins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge made a note of that concession, on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the first corridor next,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we moved the\r\nornaments in that part, we moved a statue of a fat naked\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x94profanely described in the catalogue of the house as \xe2\x80\x98Cupid, god\r\nof Love.\xe2\x80\x99 He had two wings last year, in the fleshy part of his\r\nshoulders. My eye being off him, for the moment, he lost one of them.\r\nAm I responsible for Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s wing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made another concession, and Betteredge made another note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the second corridor,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere having been nothing in\r\nit, last year, but the doors of the rooms (to everyone of which I can\r\nswear, if necessary), my mind is easy, I admit, respecting that part of\r\nthe house only. But, as to Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom (if _that_ is to be\r\nput back to what it was before), I want to know who is responsible for\r\nkeeping it in a perpetual state of litter, no matter how often it may\r\nbe set right\xe2\x80\x94his trousers here, his towels there, and his French novels\r\neverywhere. I say, who is responsible for untidying the tidiness of Mr.\r\nFranklin\xe2\x80\x99s room, him or me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Blake declared that he would assume the whole responsibility with\r\nthe greatest pleasure. Betteredge obstinately declined to listen to any\r\nsolution of the difficulty, without first referring it to my sanction\r\nand approval. I accepted Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s proposal; and Betteredge made a\r\nlast entry in the pocket-book to that effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook in when you like, Mr. Jennings, beginning from tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, getting on his legs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find me at work, with the\r\nnecessary persons to assist me. I respectfully beg to thank you, sir,\r\nfor overlooking the case of the stuffed buzzard, and the other case of\r\nthe Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s wing\xe2\x80\x94as also for permitting me to wash my hands of all\r\nresponsibility in respect of the pins on the carpet, and the litter in\r\nMr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s room. Speaking as a servant, I am deeply indebted to\r\nyou. Speaking as a man, I consider you to be a person whose head is\r\nfull of maggots, and I take up my testimony against your experiment as\r\na delusion and a snare. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, on that account, of my\r\nfeelings as a man getting in the way of my duty as a servant! You shall\r\nbe obeyed. The maggots notwithstanding, sir, you shall be obeyed. If it\r\nends in your setting the house on fire, Damme if I send for the\r\nengines, unless you ring the bell and order them first!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that farewell assurance, he made me a bow, and walked out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think we can depend on him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImplicitly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Blake. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we go to the house, we shall\r\nfind nothing neglected, and nothing forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJune 19th.\xe2\x80\x94Another protest against our contemplated proceedings! From a\r\nlady this time.\r\n\r\nThe morning\xe2\x80\x99s post brought me two letters. One from Miss Verinder,\r\nconsenting, in the kindest manner, to the arrangement that I have\r\nproposed. The other from the lady under whose care she is living\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nMrs. Merridew.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merridew presents her compliments, and does not pretend to\r\nunderstand the subject on which I have been corresponding with Miss\r\nVerinder, in its scientific bearings. Viewed in its social bearings,\r\nhowever, she feels free to pronounce an opinion. I am probably, Mrs.\r\nMerridew thinks, not aware that Miss Verinder is barely nineteen years\r\nof age. To allow a young lady, at her time of life, to be present\r\n(without a \xe2\x80\x9cchaperone\xe2\x80\x9d) in a house full of men among whom a medical\r\nexperiment is being carried on, is an outrage on propriety which Mrs.\r\nMerridew cannot possibly permit. If the matter is allowed to proceed,\r\nshe will feel it to be her duty\xe2\x80\x94at a serious sacrifice of her own\r\npersonal convenience\xe2\x80\x94to accompany Miss Verinder to Yorkshire. Under\r\nthese circumstances, she ventures to request that I will kindly\r\nreconsider the subject; seeing that Miss Verinder declines to be guided\r\nby any opinion but mine. Her presence cannot possibly be necessary; and\r\na word from me, to that effect, would relieve both Mrs. Merridew and\r\nmyself of a very unpleasant responsibility.\r\n\r\nTranslated from polite commonplace into plain English, the meaning of\r\nthis is, as I take it, that Mrs. Merridew stands in mortal fear of the\r\nopinion of the world. She has unfortunately appealed to the very last\r\nman in existence who has any reason to regard that opinion with\r\nrespect. I won\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint Miss Verinder; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t delay a\r\nreconciliation between two young people who love each other, and who\r\nhave been parted too long already. Translated from plain English into\r\npolite commonplace, this means that Mr. Jennings presents his\r\ncompliments to Mrs. Merridew, and regrets that he cannot feel justified\r\nin interfering any farther in the matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s report of himself, this morning, was the same as before. We\r\ndetermined not to disturb Betteredge by overlooking him at the house\r\ntoday. Tomorrow will be time enough for our first visit of inspection.\r\n\r\nJune 20th.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Blake is beginning to feel his continued restlessness at\r\nnight. The sooner the rooms are refurnished, now, the better.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the house, this morning, he consulted me, with some\r\nnervous impatience and irresolution, about a letter (forwarded to him\r\nfrom London) which he had received from Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant writes from Ireland. He acknowledges the receipt (through\r\nhis housekeeper) of a card and message which Mr. Blake left at his\r\nresidence near Dorking, and announces his return to England as likely\r\nto take place in a week or less. In the meantime, he requests to be\r\nfavoured with Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for wishing to speak to him (as\r\nstated in the message) on the subject of the Moonstone. If Mr. Blake\r\ncan convict him of having made any serious mistake, in the course of\r\nhis last year\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry concerning the Diamond, he will consider it a\r\nduty (after the liberal manner in which he was treated by the late Lady\r\nVerinder) to place himself at that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s disposal. If not, he\r\nbegs permission to remain in his retirement, surrounded by the peaceful\r\nhorticultural attractions of a country life.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the letter, I had no hesitation in advising Mr. Blake to\r\ninform Sergeant Cuff, in reply, of all that had happened since the\r\ninquiry was suspended last year, and to leave him to draw his own\r\nconclusions from the plain facts.\r\n\r\nOn second thoughts I also suggested inviting the Sergeant to be present\r\nat the experiment, in the event of his returning to England in time to\r\njoin us. He would be a valuable witness to have, in any case; and, if I\r\nproved to be wrong in believing the Diamond to be hidden in Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, his advice might be of great importance, at a future stage of the\r\nproceedings over which I could exercise no control. This last\r\nconsideration appeared to decide Mr. Blake. He promised to follow my\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the hammer informed us that the work of refurnishing was\r\nin full progress, as we entered the drive that led to the house.\r\n\r\nBetteredge, attired for the occasion in a fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s red cap, and an\r\napron of green baize, met us in the outer hall. The moment he saw me,\r\nhe pulled out the pocket-book and pencil, and obstinately insisted on\r\ntaking notes of everything that I said to him. Look where we might, we\r\nfound, as Mr. Blake had foretold that the work was advancing as rapidly\r\nand as intelligently as it was possible to desire. But there was still\r\nmuch to be done in the inner hall, and in Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s room. It\r\nseemed doubtful whether the house would be ready for us before the end\r\nof the week.\r\n\r\nHaving congratulated Betteredge on the progress that he had made (he\r\npersisted in taking notes every time I opened my lips; declining, at\r\nthe same time, to pay the slightest attention to anything said by Mr.\r\nBlake); and having promised to return for a second visit of inspection\r\nin a day or two, we prepared to leave the house, going out by the back\r\nway. Before we were clear of the passages downstairs, I was stopped by\r\nBetteredge, just as I was passing the door which led into his own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I say two words to you in private?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a mysterious\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nI consented of course. Mr. Blake walked on to wait for me in the\r\ngarden, while I accompanied Betteredge into his room. I fully\r\nanticipated a demand for certain new concessions, following the\r\nprecedent already established in the cases of the stuffed buzzard, and\r\nthe Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s wing. To my great surprise, Betteredge laid his hand\r\nconfidentially on my arm, and put this extraordinary question to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jennings, do you happen to be acquainted with _Robinson Crusoe_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered that I had read _Robinson Crusoe_ when I was a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since then?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Betteredge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe fell back a few steps, and looked at me with an expression of\r\ncompassionate curiosity, tempered by superstitious awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not read _Robinson Crusoe_ since he was a child,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBetteredge, speaking to himself\xe2\x80\x94not to me. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try how _Robinson\r\nCrusoe_ strikes him now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe unlocked a cupboard in a corner, and produced a dirty and\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s-eared book, which exhaled a strong odour of stale tobacco as he\r\nturned over the leaves. Having found a passage of which he was\r\napparently in search, he requested me to join him in the corner; still\r\nmysteriously confidential, and still speaking under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn respect to this hocus-pocus of yours, sir, with the laudanum and\r\nMr. Franklin Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the workpeople are in the house,\r\nmy duty as a servant gets the better of my feelings as a man. When the\r\nworkpeople are gone, my feelings as a man get the better of my duty as\r\na servant. Very good. Last night, Mr. Jennings, it was borne in\r\npowerfully on my mind that this new medical enterprise of yours would\r\nend badly. If I had yielded to that secret Dictate, I should have put\r\nall the furniture away again with my own hand, and have warned the\r\nworkmen off the premises when they came the next morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to find, from what I have seen upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nresisted the secret Dictate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cResisted isn\xe2\x80\x99t the word,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Betteredge. \xe2\x80\x9cWrostled is the word.\r\nI wrostled, sir, between the silent orders in my bosom pulling me one\r\nway, and the written orders in my pocket-book pushing me the other,\r\nuntil (saving your presence) I was in a cold sweat. In that dreadful\r\nperturbation of mind and laxity of body, to what remedy did I apply? To\r\nthe remedy, sir, which has never failed me yet for the last thirty\r\nyears and more\xe2\x80\x94to This Book!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hit the book a sounding blow with his open hand, and struck out of\r\nit a stronger smell of stale tobacco than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I find here,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Betteredge, \xe2\x80\x9cat the first page I\r\nopened? This awful bit, sir, page one hundred and seventy-eight, as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Upon these, and many like Reflections, I afterwards made it a\r\ncertain rule with me, That whenever I found those secret Hints or\r\nPressings of my Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing that presented;\r\nor to going this Way, or that Way, I never failed to obey the secret\r\nDictate.\xe2\x80\x99 As I live by bread, Mr. Jennings, those were the first words\r\nthat met my eye, exactly at the time when I myself was setting the\r\nsecret Dictate at defiance! You don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything at all out of the\r\ncommon in that, do you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a coincidence\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t feel at all shaken, Mr. Jennings, in respect to this medical\r\nenterprise of yours?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge stared hard at me, in dead silence. He closed the book with\r\ngreat deliberation; he locked it up again in the cupboard with\r\nextraordinary care; he wheeled round, and stared hard at me once more.\r\nThen he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are great allowances to be made for a\r\nman who has not read _Robinson Crusoe_ since he was a child. I wish you\r\ngood morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened his door with a low bow, and left me at liberty to find my\r\nown way into the garden. I met Mr. Blake returning to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge has\r\nplayed his last card: he has made another prophetic discovery in\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_. Have you humoured his favourite delusion? No? You\r\nhave let him see that you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in _Robinson Crusoe_? Mr.\r\nJennings! you have fallen to the lowest possible place in Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestimation. Say what you like, and do what you like, for the future.\r\nYou will find that he won\xe2\x80\x99t waste another word on you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJune 21st.\xe2\x80\x94A short entry must suffice in my journal today.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake has had the worst night that he has passed yet. I have been\r\nobliged, greatly against my will, to prescribe for him. Men of his\r\nsensitive organisation are fortunately quick in feeling the effect of\r\nremedial measures. Otherwise, I should be inclined to fear that he will\r\nbe totally unfit for the experiment when the time comes to try it.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, after some little remission of my pains for the last two\r\ndays I had an attack this morning, of which I shall say nothing but\r\nthat it has decided me to return to the opium. I shall close this book,\r\nand take my full dose\xe2\x80\x94five hundred drops.\r\n\r\nJune 22nd.\xe2\x80\x94Our prospects look better today. Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s nervous\r\nsuffering is greatly allayed. He slept a little last night. _My_ night,\r\nthanks to the opium, was the night of a man who is stunned. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nthat I woke this morning; the fitter expression would be, that I\r\nrecovered my senses.\r\n\r\nWe drove to the house to see if the refurnishing was done. It will be\r\ncompleted tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94Saturday. As Mr. Blake foretold, Betteredge raised\r\nno further obstacles. From first to last, he was ominously polite, and\r\nominously silent.\r\n\r\nMy medical enterprise (as Betteredge calls it) must now, inevitably, be\r\ndelayed until Monday next. Tomorrow evening the workmen will be late in\r\nthe house. On the next day, the established Sunday tyranny which is one\r\nof the institutions of this free country, so times the trains as to\r\nmake it impossible to ask anybody to travel to us from London. Until\r\nMonday comes, there is nothing to be done but to watch Mr. Blake\r\ncarefully, and to keep him, if possible, in the same state in which I\r\nfind him today.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, I have prevailed on him to write to Mr. Bruff, making\r\na point of it that he shall be present as one of the witnesses. I\r\nespecially choose the lawyer, because he is strongly prejudiced against\r\nus. If we convince _him_, we place our victory beyond the possibility\r\nof dispute.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake has also written to Sergeant Cuff; and I have sent a line to\r\nMiss Verinder. With these, and with old Betteredge (who is really a\r\nperson of importance in the family) we shall have witnesses enough for\r\nthe purpose\xe2\x80\x94without including Mrs. Merridew, if Mrs. Merridew persists\r\nin sacrificing herself to the opinion of the world.\r\n\r\nJune 23rd.\xe2\x80\x94The vengeance of the opium overtook me again last night. No\r\nmatter; I must go on with it now till Monday is past and gone.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake is not so well again today. At two this morning, he confesses\r\nthat he opened the drawer in which his cigars are put away. He only\r\nsucceeded in locking it up again by a violent effort. His next\r\nproceeding, in case of temptation, was to throw the key out of window.\r\nThe waiter brought it in this morning, discovered at the bottom of an\r\nempty cistern\xe2\x80\x94such is Fate! I have taken possession of the key until\r\nTuesday next.\r\n\r\nJune 24th.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Blake and I took a long drive in an open carriage. We\r\nboth felt beneficially the blessed influence of the soft summer air. I\r\ndined with him at the hotel. To my great relief\xe2\x80\x94for I found him in an\r\nover-wrought, over-excited state this morning\xe2\x80\x94he had two hours\xe2\x80\x99 sound\r\nsleep on the sofa after dinner. If he has another bad night, now\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nnot afraid of the consequences.\r\n\r\nJune 25th, Monday.\xe2\x80\x94The day of the experiment! It is five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon. We have just arrived at the house.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost question, is the question of Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s health.\r\n\r\nSo far as it is possible for me to judge, he promises (physically\r\nspeaking) to be quite as susceptible to the action of the opium tonight\r\nas he was at this time last year. He is, this afternoon, in a state of\r\nnervous sensitiveness which just stops short of nervous irritation. He\r\nchanges colour readily; his hand is not quite steady; and he starts at\r\nchance noises, and at unexpected appearances of persons and things.\r\n\r\nThese results have all been produced by deprivation of sleep, which is\r\nin its turn the nervous consequence of a sudden cessation in the habit\r\nof smoking, after that habit has been carried to an extreme. Here are\r\nthe same causes at work again, which operated last year; and here are,\r\napparently, the same effects. Will the parallel still hold good, when\r\nthe final test has been tried? The events of the night must decide.\r\n\r\nWhile I write these lines, Mr. Blake is amusing himself at the billiard\r\ntable in the inner hall, practising different strokes in the game, as\r\nhe was accustomed to practise them when he was a guest in this house in\r\nJune last. I have brought my journal here, partly with a view to\r\noccupying the idle hours which I am sure to have on my hands between\r\nthis and tomorrow morning; partly in the hope that something may happen\r\nwhich it may be worth my while to place on record at the time.\r\n\r\nHave I omitted anything, thus far? A glance at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s entry shows\r\nme that I have forgotten to note the arrival of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s post. Let\r\nme set this right before I close these leaves for the present, and join\r\nMr. Blake.\r\n\r\nI received a few lines then, yesterday, from Miss Verinder. She has\r\narranged to travel by the afternoon train, as I recommended. Mrs.\r\nMerridew has insisted on accompanying her. The note hints that the old\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s generally excellent temper is a little ruffled, and requests all\r\ndue indulgence for her, in consideration of her age and her habits. I\r\nwill endeavour, in my relations with Mrs. Merridew, to emulate the\r\nmoderation which Betteredge displays in his relations with me. He\r\nreceived us today, portentously arrayed in his best black suit, and his\r\nstiffest white cravat. Whenever he looks my way, he remembers that I\r\nhave not read _Robinson Crusoe_ since I was a child, and he\r\nrespectfully pities me.\r\n\r\nYesterday, also, Mr. Blake had the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s answer. Mr. Bruff accepts\r\nthe invitation\xe2\x80\x94under protest. It is, he thinks, clearly necessary that\r\na gentleman possessed of the average allowance of common sense, should\r\naccompany Miss Verinder to the scene of, what we will venture to call,\r\nthe proposed exhibition. For want of a better escort, Mr. Bruff himself\r\nwill be that gentleman.\xe2\x80\x94So here is poor Miss Verinder provided with two\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchaperones.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a relief to think that the opinion of the world\r\nmust surely be satisfied with this!\r\n\r\nNothing has been heard of Sergeant Cuff. He is no doubt still in\r\nIreland. We must not expect to see him tonight.\r\n\r\nBetteredge has just come in, to say that Mr. Blake has asked for me. I\r\nmust lay down my pen for the present.\r\n\r\nSeven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94We have been all over the refurnished rooms and\r\nstaircases again; and we have had a pleasant stroll in the shrubbery,\r\nwhich was Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s favourite walk when he was here last. In this\r\nway, I hope to revive the old impressions of places and things as\r\nvividly as possible in his mind.\r\n\r\nWe are now going to dine, exactly at the hour at which the birthday\r\ndinner was given last year. My object, of course, is a purely medical\r\none in this case. The laudanum must find the process of digestion, as\r\nnearly as may be, where the laudanum found it last year.\r\n\r\nAt a reasonable time after dinner I propose to lead the conversation\r\nback again\xe2\x80\x94as inartificially as I can\xe2\x80\x94to the subject of the Diamond,\r\nand of the Indian conspiracy to steal it. When I have filled his mind\r\nwith these topics, I shall have done all that it is in my power to do,\r\nbefore the time comes for giving him the second dose.\r\n\r\nHalf-past eight.\xe2\x80\x94I have only this moment found an opportunity of\r\nattending to the most important duty of all; the duty of looking in the\r\nfamily medicine chest, for the laudanum which Mr. Candy used last year.\r\n\r\nTen minutes since, I caught Betteredge at an unoccupied moment, and\r\ntold him what I wanted. Without a word of objection, without so much as\r\nan attempt to produce his pocket-book, he led the way (making\r\nallowances for me at every step) to the store-room in which the\r\nmedicine chest is kept.\r\n\r\nI discovered the bottle, carefully guarded by a glass stopper tied over\r\nwith leather. The preparation which it contained was, as I had\r\nanticipated, the common Tincture of Opium. Finding the bottle still\r\nwell filled, I have resolved to use it, in preference to employing\r\neither of the two preparations with which I had taken care to provide\r\nmyself, in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nThe question of the quantity which I am to administer presents certain\r\ndifficulties. I have thought it over, and have decided on increasing\r\nthe dose.\r\n\r\nMy notes inform me that Mr. Candy only administered twenty-five minims.\r\nThis is a small dose to have produced the results which followed\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nin the case of a person so sensitive as Mr. Blake. I think it highly\r\nprobable that Mr. Candy gave more than he supposed himself to have\r\ngiven\xe2\x80\x94knowing, as I do, that he has a keen relish of the pleasures of\r\nthe table, and that he measured out the laudanum on the birthday, after\r\ndinner. In any case, I shall run the risk of enlarging the dose to\r\nforty minims. On this occasion, Mr. Blake knows beforehand that he is\r\ngoing to take the laudanum\xe2\x80\x94which is equivalent, physiologically\r\nspeaking, to his having (unconsciously to himself) a certain capacity\r\nin him to resist the effects. If my view is right, a larger quantity is\r\ntherefore imperatively required, this time, to repeat the results which\r\nthe smaller quantity produced, last year.\r\n\r\nTen o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94The witnesses, or the company (which shall I call them?)\r\nreached the house an hour since.\r\n\r\nA little before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I prevailed on Mr. Blake to accompany me\r\nto his bedroom; stating, as a reason, that I wished him to look round\r\nit, for the last time, in order to make quite sure that nothing had\r\nbeen forgotten in the refurnishing of the room. I had previously\r\narranged with Betteredge, that the bedchamber prepared for Mr. Bruff\r\nshould be the next room to Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s, and that I should be informed\r\nof the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s arrival by a knock at the door. Five minutes after the\r\nclock in the hall had struck nine, I heard the knock; and, going out\r\nimmediately, met Mr. Bruff in the corridor.\r\n\r\nMy personal appearance (as usual) told against me. Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s distrust\r\nlooked at me plainly enough out of Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Being well used to\r\nproducing this effect on strangers, I did not hesitate a moment in\r\nsaying what I wanted to say, before the lawyer found his way into Mr.\r\nBlake\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have travelled here, I believe, in company with Mrs. Merridew and\r\nMiss Verinder?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bruff, as drily as might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Verinder has probably told you, that I wish her presence in the\r\nhouse (and Mrs. Merridew\xe2\x80\x99s presence of course) to be kept a secret from\r\nMr. Blake, until my experiment on him has been tried first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that I am to hold my tongue, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff, impatiently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing habitually silent on the subject of human folly, I am all the\r\nreadier to keep my lips closed on this occasion. Does that satisfy\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bowed, and left Betteredge to show him to his room. Betteredge gave\r\nme one look at parting, which said, as if in so many words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\ncaught a Tartar, Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x94and the name of him is Bruff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was next necessary to get the meeting over with the two ladies. I\r\ndescended the stairs\xe2\x80\x94a little nervously, I confess\xe2\x80\x94on my way to Miss\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife (charged with looking after the accommodation of\r\nthe ladies) met me in the first-floor corridor. This excellent woman\r\ntreats me with an excessive civility which is plainly the offspring of\r\ndown-right terror. She stares, trembles, and curtseys, whenever I speak\r\nto her. On my asking for Miss Verinder, she stared, trembled, and would\r\nno doubt have curtseyed next, if Miss Verinder herself had not cut that\r\nceremony short, by suddenly opening her sitting-room door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that Mr. Jennings?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer, she came out eagerly to speak to me in the\r\ncorridor. We met under the light of a lamp on a bracket. At the first\r\nsight of me, Miss Verinder stopped, and hesitated. She recovered\r\nherself instantly, coloured for a moment\xe2\x80\x94and then, with a charming\r\nfrankness, offered me her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t treat you like a stranger, Mr. Jennings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if\r\nyou only knew how happy your letters have made me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at my ugly wrinkled face, with a bright gratitude so new to\r\nme in _my_ experience of my fellow-creatures, that I was at a loss how\r\nto answer her. Nothing had prepared me for her kindness and her beauty.\r\nThe misery of many years has not hardened my heart, thank God. I was as\r\nawkward and as shy with her, as if I had been a lad in my teens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, giving free expression to her one\r\ndominant interest\xe2\x80\x94the interest in Mr. Blake. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing? Has he\r\nspoken of me? Is he in good spirits? How does he bear the sight of the\r\nhouse, after what happened in it last year? When are you going to give\r\nhim the laudanum? May I see you pour it out? I am so interested; I am\r\nso excited\xe2\x80\x94I have ten thousand things to say to you, and they all crowd\r\ntogether so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say first. Do you wonder at the\r\ninterest I take in this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI venture to think that I thoroughly understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was far above the paltry affectation of being confused. She\r\nanswered me as she might have answered a brother or a father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have relieved me of indescribable wretchedness; you have given me\r\na new life. How can I be ungrateful enough to have any concealment from\r\n_you?_ I love him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply, \xe2\x80\x9cI have loved him from first to\r\nlast\xe2\x80\x94even when I was wronging him in my own thoughts; even when I was\r\nsaying the hardest and the cruellest words to him. Is there any excuse\r\nfor me, in that? I hope there is\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid it is the only excuse I\r\nhave. When tomorrow comes, and he knows that I am in the house, do you\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped again, and looked at me very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen tomorrow comes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have only to tell him what\r\nyou have just told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face brightened; she came a step nearer to me. Her fingers trifled\r\nnervously with a flower which I had picked in the garden, and which I\r\nhad put into the button-hole of my coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen a great deal of him lately,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you, really\r\nand truly, seen _that?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally and truly,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite certain of what will happen\r\ntomorrow. I wish I could feel as certain of what will happen tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that point in the conversation, we were interrupted by the\r\nappearance of Betteredge with the tea-tray. He gave me another\r\nsignificant look as he passed on into the sitting-room. \xe2\x80\x9cAye! aye! make\r\nyour hay while the sun shines. The Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s upstairs, Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nTartar\xe2\x80\x99s upstairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe followed him into the room. A little old lady, in a corner, very\r\nnicely dressed, and very deeply absorbed over a smart piece of\r\nembroidery, dropped her work in her lap, and uttered a faint little\r\nscream at the first sight of my gipsy complexion and my piebald hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Merridew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Verinder, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is Mr. Jennings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady, looking at Miss\r\nVerinder, and speaking at _me_. \xe2\x80\x9cRailway travelling always makes me\r\nnervous. I am endeavouring to quiet my mind by occupying myself as\r\nusual. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether my embroidery is out of place, on this\r\nextraordinary occasion. If it interferes with Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x99s medical\r\nviews, I shall be happy to put it away of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hastened to sanction the presence of the embroidery, exactly as I had\r\nsanctioned the absence of the burst buzzard and the Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s wing. Mrs.\r\nMerridew made an effort\xe2\x80\x94a grateful effort\xe2\x80\x94to look at my hair. No! it\r\nwas not to be done. Mrs. Merridew looked back again at Miss Verinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Jennings will permit me,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the old lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like\r\nto ask a favour. Mr. Jennings is about to try a scientific experiment\r\ntonight. I used to attend scientific experiments when I was a girl at\r\nschool. They invariably ended in an explosion. If Mr. Jennings will be\r\nso very kind, I should like to be warned of the explosion this time.\r\nWith a view to getting it over, if possible, before I go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI attempted to assure Mrs. Merridew that an explosion was not included\r\nin the programme on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old lady. \xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x94I am aware\r\nthat he is only deceiving me for my own good. I prefer plain dealing. I\r\nam quite resigned to the explosion\xe2\x80\x94but I _do_ want to get it over, if\r\npossible, before I go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and Mrs. Merridew uttered another little scream.\r\nThe advent of the explosion? No: only the advent of Betteredge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Jennings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Betteredge, in his most\r\nelaborately confidential manner. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Franklin wishes to know where you\r\nare. Being under your orders to deceive him, in respect to the presence\r\nof my young lady in the house, I have said I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. That you will\r\nplease to observe, was a lie. Having one foot already in the grave,\r\nsir, the fewer lies you expect me to tell, the more I shall be indebted\r\nto you, when my conscience pricks me and my time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to be wasted on the purely speculative question\r\nof Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s conscience. Mr. Blake might make his appearance in\r\nsearch of me, unless I went to him at once in his own room. Miss\r\nVerinder followed me out into the corridor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to be in a conspiracy to persecute you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the protest of the world, Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x94on a very small\r\nscale\xe2\x80\x94against anything that is new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do with Mrs. Merridew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell her the explosion will take place at nine tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo as to send her to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94so as to send her to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Verinder went back to the sitting-room, and I went upstairs to Mr.\r\nBlake.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise I found him alone; restlessly pacing his room, and a\r\nlittle irritated at being left by himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Bruff?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the closed door of communication between the two rooms.\r\nMr. Bruff had looked in on him, for a moment; had attempted to renew\r\nhis protest against our proceedings; and had once more failed to\r\nproduce the smallest impression on Mr. Blake. Upon this, the lawyer had\r\ntaken refuge in a black leather bag, filled to bursting with\r\nprofessional papers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe serious business of life,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted, \xe2\x80\x9cwas\r\nsadly out of place on such an occasion as the present. But the serious\r\nbusiness of life must be carried on, for all that. Mr. Blake would\r\nperhaps kindly make allowance for the old-fashioned habits of a\r\npractical man. Time was money\xe2\x80\x94and, as for Mr. Jennings, he might depend\r\non it that Mr. Bruff would be forthcoming when called upon.\xe2\x80\x9d With that\r\napology, the lawyer had gone back to his own room, and had immersed\r\nhimself obstinately in his black bag.\r\n\r\nI thought of Mrs. Merridew and her embroidery, and of Betteredge and\r\nhis conscience. There is a wonderful sameness in the solid side of the\r\nEnglish character\xe2\x80\x94just as there is a wonderful sameness in the solid\r\nexpression of the English face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going to give me the laudanum?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Blake\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must wait a little longer,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will stay and keep you\r\ncompany till the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was then not ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Inquiries which I had made, at various\r\ntimes, of Betteredge and Mr. Blake, had led me to the conclusion that\r\nthe dose of laudanum given by Mr. Candy could not possibly have been\r\nadministered before eleven. I had accordingly determined not to try the\r\nsecond dose until that time.\r\n\r\nWe talked a little; but both our minds were preoccupied by the coming\r\nordeal. The conversation soon flagged\xe2\x80\x94then dropped altogether. Mr.\r\nBlake idly turned over the books on his bedroom table. I had taken the\r\nprecaution of looking at them, when we first entered the room. _The\r\nGuardian_; _The Tatler_; Richardson\xe2\x80\x99s _Pamela_; Mackenzie\xe2\x80\x99s _Man of\r\nFeeling_; Roscoe\xe2\x80\x99s _Lorenzo de\xe2\x80\x99 Medici_; and Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s _Charles the\r\nFifth_\xe2\x80\x94all classical works; all (of course) immeasurably superior to\r\nanything produced in later times; and all (from my present point of\r\nview) possessing the one great merit of enchaining nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interest,\r\nand exciting nobody\xe2\x80\x99s brain. I left Mr. Blake to the composing\r\ninfluence of Standard Literature, and occupied myself in making this\r\nentry in my journal.\r\n\r\nMy watch informs me that it is close on eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I must shut up\r\nthese leaves once more.\r\n\r\nTwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M.\xe2\x80\x94The experiment has been tried. With what result, I am\r\nnow to describe.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I rang the bell for Betteredge, and told Mr. Blake\r\nthat he might at last prepare himself for bed.\r\n\r\nI looked out of the window at the night. It was mild and rainy,\r\nresembling, in this respect, the night of the birthday\xe2\x80\x94the twenty-first\r\nof June, last year. Without professing to believe in omens, it was at\r\nleast encouraging to find no direct nervous influences\xe2\x80\x94no stormy or\r\nelectric perturbations\xe2\x80\x94in the atmosphere. Betteredge joined me at the\r\nwindow, and mysteriously put a little slip of paper into my hand. It\r\ncontained these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Merridew has gone to bed, on the distinct understanding that the\r\nexplosion is to take place at nine tomorrow morning, and that I am not\r\nto stir out of this part of the house until she comes and sets me free.\r\nShe has no idea that the chief scene of the experiment is my\r\nsitting-room\xe2\x80\x94or she would have remained in it for the whole night! I am\r\nalone, and very anxious. Pray let me see you measure out the laudanum;\r\nI want to have something to do with it, even in the unimportant\r\ncharacter of a mere looker-on.\xe2\x80\x94R.V.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed Betteredge out of the room, and told him to remove the\r\nmedicine-chest into Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe order appeared to take him completely by surprise. He looked as if\r\nhe suspected me of some occult medical design on Miss Verinder! \xe2\x80\x9cMight\r\nI presume to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat my young lady and the medicine-chest\r\nhave got to do with each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay in the sitting-room, and you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge appeared to doubt his own unaided capacity to superintend me\r\neffectually, on an occasion when a medicine-chest was included in the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any objection, sir\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto taking Mr. Bruff into this\r\npart of the business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary! I am now going to ask Mr. Bruff to accompany me\r\ndownstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge withdrew to fetch the medicine-chest, without another word.\r\nI went back into Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s room, and knocked at the door of\r\ncommunication. Mr. Bruff opened it, with his papers in his\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94immersed in Law; impenetrable to Medicine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am going to prepare the\r\nlaudanum for Mr. Blake; and I must request you to be present, and to\r\nsee what I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff, with nine-tenths of his attention riveted on his\r\npapers, and with one-tenth unwillingly accorded to me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must trouble you to return here with me, and to see me administer\r\nthe dose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more. I must put you to the inconvenience of remaining in\r\nMr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s room, and of waiting to see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cMy room, or Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s room\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter which; I can go on with my papers anywhere. Unless you\r\nobject, Mr. Jennings, to my importing _that_ amount of common sense\r\ninto the proceedings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer, Mr. Blake addressed himself to the lawyer,\r\nspeaking from his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean to say that you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any interest in what we\r\nare going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bruff, you have no more imagination\r\nthan a cow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cow is a very useful animal, Mr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer. With that\r\nreply he followed me out of the room, still keeping his papers in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWe found Miss Verinder, pale and agitated, restlessly pacing her\r\nsitting-room from end to end. At a table in a corner stood Betteredge,\r\non guard over the medicine-chest. Mr. Bruff sat down on the first chair\r\nthat he could find, and (emulating the usefulness of the cow) plunged\r\nback again into his papers on the spot.\r\n\r\nMiss Verinder drew me aside, and reverted instantly to her one\r\nall-absorbing interest\xe2\x80\x94her interest in Mr. Blake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he nervous? is he out of temper? Do you\r\nthink it will succeed? Are you sure it will do no harm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure. Come, and see me measure it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment! It is past eleven now. How long will it be before anything\r\nhappens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not easy to say. An hour perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the room must be dark, as it was last year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall wait in my bedroom\xe2\x80\x94just as I did before. I shall keep the door\r\na little way open. It was a little way open last year. I will watch the\r\nsitting-room door; and the moment it moves, I will blow out my light.\r\nIt all happened in that way, on my birthday night. And it must all\r\nhappen again in the same way, musn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you can control yourself, Miss Verinder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _his_ interests, I can do anything!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered fervently.\r\n\r\nOne look at her face told me that I could trust her. I addressed myself\r\nagain to Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must trouble you to put your papers aside for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d He got up with a start\xe2\x80\x94as if I had disturbed him at a\r\nparticularly interesting place\xe2\x80\x94and followed me to the medicine-chest.\r\nThere, deprived of the breathless excitement incidental to the practice\r\nof his profession, he looked at Betteredge\xe2\x80\x94and yawned wearily.\r\n\r\nMiss Verinder joined me with a glass jug of cold water, which she had\r\ntaken from a side-table. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me pour out the water,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_must_ have a hand in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI measured out the forty minims from the bottle, and poured the\r\nlaudanum into a medicine glass. \xe2\x80\x9cFill it till it is three parts full,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI said, and handed the glass to Miss Verinder. I then directed\r\nBetteredge to lock up the medicine chest; informing him that I had done\r\nwith it now. A look of unutterable relief overspread the old servant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance. He had evidently suspected me of a medical design on his\r\nyoung lady!\r\n\r\nAfter adding the water as I had directed, Miss Verinder seized a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94while Betteredge was locking the chest, and while Mr. Bruff was\r\nlooking back to his papers\xe2\x80\x94and slyly kissed the rim of the medicine\r\nglass. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you give it to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the charming girl, \xe2\x80\x9cgive it to\r\nhim on that side!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took the piece of crystal which was to represent the Diamond from my\r\npocket, and gave it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have a hand in this, too,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must put it where you\r\nput the Moonstone last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led the way to the Indian cabinet, and put the mock Diamond into\r\nthe drawer which the real Diamond had occupied on the birthday night.\r\nMr. Bruff witnessed this proceeding, under protest, as he had witnessed\r\neverything else. But the strong dramatic interest which the experiment\r\nwas now assuming, proved (to my great amusement) to be too much for\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s capacity of self-restraint. His hand trembled as he held\r\nthe candle, and he whispered anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure, miss, it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nright drawer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI led the way out again, with the laudanum and water in my hand. At the\r\ndoor, I stopped to address a last word to Miss Verinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be long in putting out the lights,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put them out at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will wait in my\r\nbedroom, with only one candle alight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed the sitting-room door behind us. Followed by Mr. Bruff and\r\nBetteredge, I went back to Mr. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nWe found him moving restlessly from side to side of the bed, and\r\nwondering irritably whether he was to have the laudanum that night. In\r\nthe presence of the two witnesses, I gave him the dose, and shook up\r\nhis pillows, and told him to lie down again quietly and wait.\r\n\r\nHis bed, provided with light chintz curtains, was placed, with the head\r\nagainst the wall of the room, so as to leave a good open space on\r\neither side of it. On one side, I drew the curtains completely\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nthe part of the room thus screened from his view, I placed Mr. Bruff\r\nand Betteredge, to wait for the result. At the bottom of the bed I half\r\ndrew the curtains\xe2\x80\x94and placed my own chair at a little distance, so that\r\nI might let him see me or not see me, speak to me or not speak to me,\r\njust as the circumstances might direct. Having already been informed\r\nthat he always slept with a light in the room, I placed one of the two\r\nlighted candles on a little table at the head of the bed, where the\r\nglare of the light would not strike on his eyes. The other candle I\r\ngave to Mr. Bruff; the light, in this instance, being subdued by the\r\nscreen of the chintz curtains. The window was open at the top, so as to\r\nventilate the room. The rain fell softly, the house was quiet. It was\r\ntwenty minutes past eleven, by my watch, when the preparations were\r\ncompleted, and I took my place on the chair set apart at the bottom of\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff resumed his papers, with every appearance of being as deeply\r\ninterested in them as ever. But looking towards him now, I saw certain\r\nsigns and tokens which told me that the Law was beginning to lose its\r\nhold on him at last. The suspended interest of the situation in which\r\nwe were now placed was slowly asserting its influence even on _his_\r\nunimaginative mind. As for Betteredge, consistency of principle and\r\ndignity of conduct had become, in his case, mere empty words. He forgot\r\nthat I was performing a conjuring trick on Mr. Franklin Blake; he\r\nforgot that I had upset the house from top to bottom; he forgot that I\r\nhad not read _Robinson Crusoe_ since I was a child. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to me, \xe2\x80\x9ctell us when it will begin to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot before midnight,\xe2\x80\x9d I whispered back. \xe2\x80\x9cSay nothing, and sit still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge dropped to the lowest depth of familiarity with me, without\r\na struggle to save himself. He answered by a wink!\r\n\r\nLooking next towards Mr. Blake, I found him as restless as ever in his\r\nbed; fretfully wondering why the influence of the laudanum had not\r\nbegun to assert itself yet. To tell him, in his present humour, that\r\nthe more he fidgeted and wondered, the longer he would delay the result\r\nfor which we were now waiting, would have been simply useless. The\r\nwiser course to take was to dismiss the idea of the opium from his\r\nmind, by leading him insensibly to think of something else.\r\n\r\nWith this view, I encouraged him to talk to me; contriving so to direct\r\nthe conversation, on my side, as to lead it back again to the subject\r\nwhich had engaged us earlier in the evening\xe2\x80\x94the subject of the Diamond.\r\nI took care to revert to those portions of the story of the Moonstone,\r\nwhich related to the transport of it from London to Yorkshire; to the\r\nrisk which Mr. Blake had run in removing it from the bank at\r\nFrizinghall; and to the unexpected appearance of the Indians at the\r\nhouse, on the evening of the birthday. And I purposely assumed, in\r\nreferring to these events, to have misunderstood much of what Mr. Blake\r\nhimself had told me a few hours since. In this way, I set him talking\r\non the subject with which it was now vitally important to fill his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94without allowing him to suspect that I was making him talk for a\r\npurpose. Little by little, he became so interested in putting me right\r\nthat he forgot to fidget in the bed. His mind was far away from the\r\nquestion of the opium, at the all-important time when his eyes first\r\ntold me that the opium was beginning to lay its hold on his brain.\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch. It wanted five minutes to twelve, when the\r\npremonitory symptoms of the working of the laudanum first showed\r\nthemselves to me.\r\n\r\nAt this time, no unpractised eyes would have detected any change in\r\nhim. But, as the minutes of the new morning wore away, the\r\nswiftly-subtle progress of the influence began to show itself more\r\nplainly. The sublime intoxication of opium gleamed in his eyes; the dew\r\nof a stealthy perspiration began to glisten on his face. In five\r\nminutes more, the talk which he still kept up with me, failed in\r\ncoherence. He held steadily to the subject of the Diamond; but he\r\nceased to complete his sentences. A little later, the sentences dropped\r\nto single words. Then, there was an interval of silence. Then, he sat\r\nup in bed. Then, still busy with the subject of the Diamond, he began\r\nto talk again\xe2\x80\x94not to me, but to himself. That change told me that the\r\nfirst stage in the experiment was reached. The stimulant influence of\r\nthe opium had got him.\r\n\r\nThe time, now, was twenty-three minutes past twelve. The next half\r\nhour, at most, would decide the question of whether he would, or would\r\nnot, get up from his bed, and leave the room.\r\n\r\nIn the breathless interest of watching him\xe2\x80\x94in the unutterable triumph\r\nof seeing the first result of the experiment declare itself in the\r\nmanner, and nearly at the time, which I had anticipated\xe2\x80\x94I had utterly\r\nforgotten the two companions of my night vigil. Looking towards them\r\nnow, I saw the Law (as represented by Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s papers) lying\r\nunheeded on the floor. Mr. Bruff himself was looking eagerly through a\r\ncrevice left in the imperfectly-drawn curtains of the bed. And\r\nBetteredge, oblivious of all respect for social distinctions, was\r\npeeping over Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey both started back, on finding that I was looking at them, like two\r\nboys caught out by their schoolmaster in a fault. I signed to them to\r\ntake off their boots quietly, as I was taking off mine. If Mr. Blake\r\ngave us the chance of following him, it was vitally necessary to follow\r\nhim without noise.\r\n\r\nTen minutes passed\xe2\x80\x94and nothing happened. Then, he suddenly threw the\r\nbed-clothes off him. He put one leg out of bed. He waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had never taken it out of the bank,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas safe in the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart throbbed fast; the pulses at my temples beat furiously. The\r\ndoubt about the safety of the Diamond was, once more, the dominant\r\nimpression in his brain! On that one pivot, the whole success of the\r\nexperiment turned. The prospect thus suddenly opened before me was too\r\nmuch for my shattered nerves. I was obliged to look away from him\xe2\x80\x94or I\r\nshould have lost my self-control.\r\n\r\nThere was another interval of silence.\r\n\r\nWhen I could trust myself to look back at him he was out of his bed,\r\nstanding erect at the side of it. The pupils of his eyes were now\r\ncontracted; his eyeballs gleamed in the light of the candle as he moved\r\nhis head slowly to and fro. He was thinking; he was doubting\xe2\x80\x94he spoke\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians may be hidden in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and walked slowly to the other end of the room. He\r\nturned\xe2\x80\x94waited\xe2\x80\x94came back to the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not even locked up,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the drawer of her\r\ncabinet. And the drawer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the side of the bed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody might take it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe rose again restlessly, and reiterated his first words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know? The Indians may be hidden in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited again. I drew back behind the half curtain of the bed. He\r\nlooked about the room, with a vacant glitter in his eyes. It was a\r\nbreathless moment. There was a pause of some sort. A pause in the\r\naction of the opium? a pause in the action of the brain? Who could\r\ntell? Everything depended, now, on what he did next.\r\n\r\nHe laid himself down again on the bed!\r\n\r\nA horrible doubt crossed my mind. Was it possible that the sedative\r\naction of the opium was making itself felt already? It was not in my\r\nexperience that it should do this. But what is experience, where opium\r\nis concerned? There are probably no two men in existence on whom the\r\ndrug acts in exactly the same manner. Was some constitutional\r\npeculiarity in him, feeling the influence in some new way? Were we to\r\nfail on the very brink of success?\r\n\r\nNo! He got up again abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the devil am I to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith _this_ on my mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the light, burning on the table at the head of his bed.\r\nAfter a moment, he took the candle in his hand.\r\n\r\nI blew out the second candle, burning behind the closed curtains. I\r\ndrew back, with Mr. Bruff and Betteredge, into the farthest corner by\r\nthe bed. I signed to them to be silent, as if their lives had depended\r\non it.\r\n\r\nWe waited\xe2\x80\x94seeing and hearing nothing. We waited, hidden from him by the\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\nThe light which he was holding on the other side of us moved suddenly.\r\nThe next moment he passed us, swift and noiseless, with the candle in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nHe opened the bedroom door, and went out.\r\n\r\nWe followed him along the corridor. We followed him down the stairs. We\r\nfollowed him along the second corridor. He never looked back; he never\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\nHe opened the sitting-room door, and went in, leaving it open behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe door was hung (like all the other doors in the house) on large\r\nold-fashioned hinges. When it was opened, a crevice was opened between\r\nthe door and the post. I signed to my two companions to look through\r\nthis, so as to keep them from showing themselves. I placed\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94outside the door also\xe2\x80\x94on the opposite side. A recess in the wall\r\nwas at my left hand, in which I could instantly hide myself, if he\r\nshowed any signs of looking back into the corridor.\r\n\r\nHe advanced to the middle of the room, with the candle still in his\r\nhand: he looked about him\xe2\x80\x94but he never looked back.\r\n\r\nI saw the door of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, standing ajar. She had put\r\nout her light. She controlled herself nobly. The dim white outline of\r\nher summer dress was all that I could see. Nobody who had not known it\r\nbeforehand would have suspected that there was a living creature in the\r\nroom. She kept back, in the dark: not a word, not a movement escaped\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was now ten minutes past one. I heard, through the dead silence, the\r\nsoft drip of the rain and the tremulous passage of the night air\r\nthrough the trees.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting irresolute, for a minute or more, in the middle of the\r\nroom, he moved to the corner near the window, where the Indian cabinet\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nHe put his candle on the top of the cabinet. He opened, and shut, one\r\ndrawer after another, until he came to the drawer in which the mock\r\nDiamond was put. He looked into the drawer for a moment. Then he took\r\nthe mock Diamond out with his right hand. With the other hand, he took\r\nthe candle from the top of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nHe walked back a few steps towards the middle of the room, and stood\r\nstill again.\r\n\r\nThus far, he had exactly repeated what he had done on the birthday\r\nnight. Would his next proceeding be the same as the proceeding of last\r\nyear? Would he leave the room? Would he go back now, as I believed he\r\nhad gone back then, to his bedchamber? Would he show us what he had\r\ndone with the Diamond, when he had returned to his own room?\r\n\r\nHis first action, when he moved once more, proved to be an action which\r\nhe had _not_ performed, when he was under the influence of the opium\r\nfor the first time. He put the candle down on a table, and wandered on\r\na little towards the farther end of the room. There was a sofa there.\r\nHe leaned heavily on the back of it, with his left hand\xe2\x80\x94then roused\r\nhimself, and returned to the middle of the room. I could now see his\r\neyes. They were getting dull and heavy; the glitter in them was fast\r\ndying out.\r\n\r\nThe suspense of the moment proved too much for Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-control. She advanced a few steps\xe2\x80\x94then stopped again. Mr. Bruff\r\nand Betteredge looked across the open doorway at me for the first time.\r\nThe prevision of a coming disappointment was impressing itself on their\r\nminds as well as on mine.\r\n\r\nStill, so long as he stood where he was, there was hope. We waited, in\r\nunutterable expectation, to see what would happen next.\r\n\r\nThe next event was decisive. He let the mock Diamond drop out of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt fell on the floor, before the doorway\xe2\x80\x94plainly visible to him, and to\r\neveryone. He made no effort to pick it up: he looked down at it\r\nvacantly, and, as he looked, his head sank on his breast. He\r\nstaggered\xe2\x80\x94roused himself for an instant\xe2\x80\x94walked back unsteadily to the\r\nsofa\xe2\x80\x94and sat down on it. He made a last effort; he tried to rise, and\r\nsank back. His head fell on the sofa cushions. It was then twenty-five\r\nminutes past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Before I had put my watch back in my pocket,\r\nhe was asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was all over now. The sedative influence had got him; the experiment\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\nI entered the room, telling Mr. Bruff and Betteredge that they might\r\nfollow me. There was no fear of disturbing him. We were free to move\r\nand speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing to settle,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cis the question of what we are to\r\ndo with him. He will probably sleep for the next six or seven hours, at\r\nleast. It is some distance to carry him back to his own room. When I\r\nwas younger, I could have done it alone. But my health and strength are\r\nnot what they were\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid I must ask you to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore they could answer, Miss Verinder called to me softly. She met me\r\nat the door of her room, with a light shawl, and with the counterpane\r\nfrom her own bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to watch him while he sleeps?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am not sure enough of the action of the opium in his case to be\r\nwilling to leave him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe handed me the shawl and the counterpane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you disturb him?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cMake his bed on the sofa.\r\nI can shut my door, and keep in my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was infinitely the simplest and the safest way of disposing of him\r\nfor the night. I mentioned the suggestion to Mr. Bruff and\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x94who both approved of my adopting it. In five minutes I had\r\nlaid him comfortably on the sofa, and had covered him lightly with the\r\ncounterpane and the shawl. Miss Verinder wished us good-night, and\r\nclosed the door. At my request, we three then drew round the table in\r\nthe middle of the room, on which the candle was still burning, and on\r\nwhich writing materials were placed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore we separate,\xe2\x80\x9d I began, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a word to say about the\r\nexperiment which has been tried tonight. Two distinct objects were to\r\nbe gained by it. The first of these objects was to prove, that Mr.\r\nBlake entered this room, and took the Diamond, last year, acting\r\nunconsciously and irresponsibly, under the influence of opium. After\r\nwhat you have both seen, are you both satisfied, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey answered me in the affirmative, without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second object,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwas to discover what he did with the\r\nDiamond, after he was seen by Miss Verinder to leave her sitting-room\r\nwith the jewel in his hand, on the birthday night. The gaining of this\r\nobject depended, of course, on his still continuing exactly to repeat\r\nhis proceedings of last year. He has failed to do that; and the purpose\r\nof the experiment is defeated accordingly. I can\xe2\x80\x99t assert that I am not\r\ndisappointed at the result\xe2\x80\x94but I can honestly say that I am not\r\nsurprised by it. I told Mr. Blake from the first, that our complete\r\nsuccess in this matter depended on our completely reproducing in him\r\nthe physical and moral conditions of last year\xe2\x80\x94and I warned him that\r\nthis was the next thing to a downright impossibility. We have only\r\npartially reproduced the conditions, and the experiment has been only\r\npartially successful in consequence. It is also possible that I may\r\nhave administered too large a dose of laudanum. But I myself look upon\r\nthe first reason that I have given, as the true reason why we have to\r\nlament a failure, as well as to rejoice over a success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter saying those words, I put the writing materials before Mr. Bruff,\r\nand asked him if he had any objection\xe2\x80\x94before we separated for the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94to draw out, and sign, a plain statement of what he had seen. He\r\nat once took the pen, and produced the statement with the fluent\r\nreadiness of a practised hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe you this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, signing the paper, \xe2\x80\x9cas some atonement for\r\nwhat passed between us earlier in the evening. I beg your pardon, Mr.\r\nJennings, for having doubted you. You have done Franklin Blake an\r\ninestimable service. In our legal phrase, you have proved your case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetteredge\xe2\x80\x99s apology was characteristic of the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jennings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you read _Robinson Crusoe_ again (which\r\nI strongly recommend you to do), you will find that he never scruples\r\nto acknowledge it, when he turns out to have been in the wrong. Please\r\nto consider me, sir, as doing what Robinson Crusoe did, on the present\r\noccasion.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words he signed the paper in his turn.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff took me aside, as we rose from the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word about the Diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour theory is that Franklin\r\nBlake hid the Moonstone in his room. My theory is, that the Moonstone\r\nis in the possession of Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s bankers in London. We won\xe2\x80\x99t dispute\r\nwhich of us is right. We will only ask, which of us is in a position to\r\nput his theory to the test?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe test, in my case,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9chas been tried tonight, and has\r\nfailed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe test, in my case,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bruff, \xe2\x80\x9cis still in process of\r\ntrial. For the last two days I have had a watch set for Mr. Luker at\r\nthe bank; and I shall cause that watch to be continued until the last\r\nday of the month. I know that he must take the Diamond himself out of\r\nhis bankers\xe2\x80\x99 hands\xe2\x80\x94and I am acting on the chance that the person who\r\nhas pledged the Diamond may force him to do this by redeeming the\r\npledge. In that case I may be able to lay my hand on the person. If I\r\nsucceed, I clear up the mystery, exactly at the point where the mystery\r\nbaffles us now! Do you admit that, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI admitted it readily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going back to town by the morning train,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmay hear, when I return, that a discovery has been made\xe2\x80\x94and it may be\r\nof the greatest importance that I should have Franklin Blake at hand to\r\nappeal to, if necessary. I intend to tell him, as soon as he wakes,\r\nthat he must return with me to London. After all that has happened, may\r\nI trust to your influence to back me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff shook hands with me, and left the room. Betteredge followed\r\nhim out.\r\n\r\nI went to the sofa to look at Mr. Blake. He had not moved since I had\r\nlaid him down and made his bed\xe2\x80\x94he lay locked in a deep and quiet sleep.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still looking at him, I heard the bedroom door softly\r\nopened. Once more, Miss Verinder appeared on the threshold, in her\r\npretty summer dress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo me a last favour?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me watch him with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hesitated\xe2\x80\x94not in the interests of propriety; only in the interest of\r\nher night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. She came close to me, and took my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep; I can\xe2\x80\x99t even sit still, in my own room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nMr. Jennings, if you were me, only think how you would long to sit and\r\nlook at him. Say, yes! Do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to mention that I gave way? Surely not!\r\n\r\nShe drew a chair to the foot of the sofa. She looked at him in a silent\r\necstasy of happiness, till the tears rose in her eyes. She dried her\r\neyes, and said she would fetch her work. She fetched her work, and\r\nnever did a single stitch of it. It lay in her lap\xe2\x80\x94she was not even\r\nable to look away from him long enough to thread her needle. I thought\r\nof my own youth; I thought of the gentle eyes which had once looked\r\nlove at _me_. In the heaviness of my heart I turned to my Journal for\r\nrelief, and wrote in it what is written here.\r\n\r\nSo we kept our watch together in silence. One of us absorbed in his\r\nwriting; the other absorbed in her love.\r\n\r\nHour after hour he lay in his deep sleep. The light of the new day grew\r\nand grew in the room, and still he never moved.\r\n\r\nTowards six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I felt the warning which told me that my pains\r\nwere coming back. I was obliged to leave her alone with him for a\r\nlittle while. I said I would go upstairs, and fetch another pillow for\r\nhim out of his room. It was not a long attack, this time. In a little\r\nwhile I was able to venture back, and let her see me again.\r\n\r\nI found her at the head of the sofa, when I returned. She was just\r\ntouching his forehead with her lips. I shook my head as soberly as I\r\ncould, and pointed to her chair. She looked back at me with a bright\r\nsmile, and a charming colour in her face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would have done it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9cin my place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is just eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He is beginning to move for the first time.\r\n\r\nMiss Verinder is kneeling by the side of the sofa. She has so placed\r\nherself that when his eyes first open, they must open on her face.\r\n\r\nShall I leave them together?\r\n\r\nYes!\r\n\r\nEleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x94The house is empty again. They have arranged it among\r\nthemselves; they have all gone to London by the ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock train. My\r\nbrief dream of happiness is over. I have awakened again to the\r\nrealities of my friendless and lonely life.\r\n\r\nI dare not trust myself to write down, the kind words that have been\r\nsaid to me especially by Miss Verinder and Mr. Blake. Besides, it is\r\nneedless. Those words will come back to me in my solitary hours, and\r\nwill help me through what is left of the end of my life. Mr. Blake is\r\nto write, and tell me what happens in London. Miss Verinder is to\r\nreturn to Yorkshire in the autumn (for her marriage, no doubt); and I\r\nam to take a holiday, and be a guest in the house. Oh me, how I felt,\r\nas the grateful happiness looked at me out of her eyes, and the warm\r\npressure of her hand said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is your doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy poor patients are waiting for me. Back again, this morning, to the\r\nold routine! Back again, tonight, to the dreadful alternative between\r\nthe opium and the pain!\r\n\r\nGod be praised for His mercy! I have seen a little sunshine\xe2\x80\x94I have had\r\na happy time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_The Story resumed by Franklin Blake._\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBut few words are needed, on my part, to complete the narrative that\r\nhas been presented in the Journal of Ezra Jennings.\r\n\r\nOf myself, I have only to say that I awoke on the morning of the\r\ntwenty-sixth, perfectly ignorant of all that I had said and done under\r\nthe influence of the opium\xe2\x80\x94from the time when the drug first laid its\r\nhold on me, to the time when I opened my eyes, in Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nOf what happened after my waking, I do not feel called upon to render\r\nan account in detail. Confining myself merely to results, I have to\r\nreport that Rachel and I thoroughly understood each other, before a\r\nsingle word of explanation had passed on either side. I decline to\r\naccount, and Rachel declines to account, for the extraordinary rapidity\r\nof our reconciliation. Sir and Madam, look back at the time when you\r\nwere passionately attached to each other\xe2\x80\x94and you will know what\r\nhappened, after Ezra Jennings had shut the door of the sitting-room, as\r\nwell as I know it myself.\r\n\r\nI have, however, no objection to add, that we should have been\r\ncertainly discovered by Mrs. Merridew, but for Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s presence of\r\nmind. She heard the sound of the old lady\xe2\x80\x99s dress in the corridor, and\r\ninstantly ran out to meet her; I heard Mrs. Merridew say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d and I heard Rachel answer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe explosion!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Merridew\r\ninstantly permitted herself to be taken by the arm, and led into the\r\ngarden, out of the way of the impending shock. On her return to the\r\nhouse, she met me in the hall, and expressed herself as greatly struck\r\nby the vast improvement in Science, since the time when she was a girl\r\nat school. \xe2\x80\x9cExplosions, Mr. Blake, are infinitely milder than they\r\nwere. I assure you, I barely heard Mr. Jennings\xe2\x80\x99s explosion from the\r\ngarden. And no smell afterwards, that I can detect, now we have come\r\nback to the house! I must really apologise to your medical friend. It\r\nis only due to him to say that he has managed it beautifully!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, after vanquishing Betteredge and Mr. Bruff, Ezra Jennings\r\nvanquished Mrs. Merridew herself. There is a great deal of undeveloped\r\nliberal feeling in the world, after all!\r\n\r\nAt breakfast, Mr. Bruff made no secret of his reasons for wishing that\r\nI should accompany him to London by the morning train. The watch kept\r\nat the bank, and the result which might yet come of it, appealed so\r\nirresistibly to Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity, that she at once decided (if Mrs.\r\nMerridew had no objection) on accompanying us back to town\xe2\x80\x94so as to be\r\nwithin reach of the earliest news of our proceedings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merridew proved to be all pliability and indulgence, after the\r\ntruly considerate manner in which the explosion had conducted itself;\r\nand Betteredge was accordingly informed that we were all four to travel\r\nback together by the morning train. I fully expected that he would have\r\nasked leave to accompany us. But Rachel had wisely provided her\r\nfaithful old servant with an occupation that interested him. He was\r\ncharged with completing the refurnishing of the house, and was too full\r\nof his domestic responsibilities to feel the \xe2\x80\x9cdetective-fever\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\nmight have felt it under other circumstances.\r\n\r\nOur one subject of regret, in going to London, was the necessity of\r\nparting, more abruptly than we could have wished, with Ezra Jennings.\r\nIt was impossible to persuade him to accompany us. I could only promise\r\nto write to him\xe2\x80\x94and Rachel could only insist on his coming to see her\r\nwhen she returned to Yorkshire. There was every prospect of our meeting\r\nagain in a few months\xe2\x80\x94and yet there was something very sad in seeing\r\nour best and dearest friend left standing alone on the platform, as the\r\ntrain moved out of the station.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in London, Mr. Bruff was accosted at the terminus by a\r\nsmall boy, dressed in a jacket and trousers of threadbare black cloth,\r\nand personally remarkable in virtue of the extraordinary prominence of\r\nhis eyes. They projected so far, and they rolled about so loosely, that\r\nyou wondered uneasily why they remained in their sockets. After\r\nlistening to the boy, Mr. Bruff asked the ladies whether they would\r\nexcuse our accompanying them back to Portland Place. I had barely time\r\nto promise Rachel that I would return, and tell her everything that had\r\nhappened, before Mr. Bruff seized me by the arm, and hurried me into a\r\ncab. The boy with the ill-secured eyes took his place on the box by the\r\ndriver, and the driver was directed to go to Lombard Street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews from the bank?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, as we started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews of Mr. Luker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cAn hour ago, he was seen to leave\r\nhis house at Lambeth, in a cab, accompanied by two men, who were\r\nrecognised by _my_ men as police officers in plain clothes. If Mr.\r\nLuker\xe2\x80\x99s dread of the Indians is at the bottom of this precaution, the\r\ninference is plain enough. He is going to take the Diamond out of the\r\nbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are going to the bank to see what comes of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94or to hear what has come of it, if it is all over by this time.\r\nDid you notice my boy\xe2\x80\x94on the box, there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey call the poor little wretch \xe2\x80\x98Gooseberry\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\nthe office,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI employ him to go on errands\xe2\x80\x94and I only wish my\r\nclerks who have nick-named him were as thoroughly to be depended on as\r\nhe is. Gooseberry is one of the sharpest boys in London, Mr. Blake, in\r\nspite of his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was twenty minutes to five when we drew up before the bank in\r\nLombard Street. Gooseberry looked longingly at his master, as he opened\r\nthe cab door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to come in too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bruff kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in then,\r\nand keep at my heels till further orders. He\xe2\x80\x99s as quick as lightning,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npursued Mr. Bruff, addressing me in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo words will do with\r\nGooseberry, where twenty would be wanted with another boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe entered the bank. The outer office\xe2\x80\x94with the long counter, behind\r\nwhich the cashiers sat\xe2\x80\x94was crowded with people; all waiting their turn\r\nto take money out, or to pay money in, before the bank closed at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nTwo men among the crowd approached Mr. Bruff, as soon as he showed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe passed us here half an hour since, sir, and went on into the inner\r\noffice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he not come out again yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff turned to me. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us wait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nI looked round among the people about me for the three Indians. Not a\r\nsign of them was to be seen anywhere. The only person present with a\r\nnoticeably dark complexion was a tall man in a pilot coat, and a round\r\nhat, who looked like a sailor. Could this be one of them in disguise?\r\nImpossible! The man was taller than any of the Indians; and his face,\r\nwhere it was not hidden by a bushy black beard, was twice the breadth\r\nof any of their faces at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must have their spy somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff, looking at the\r\ndark sailor in his turn. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he may be the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could say more, his coat-tail was respectfully pulled by his\r\nattendant sprite with the gooseberry eyes. Mr. Bruff looked where the\r\nboy was looking. \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is Mr. Luker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe money-lender came out from the inner regions of the bank, followed\r\nby his two guardian policemen in plain clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your eye on him,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he passes the Diamond\r\nto anybody, he will pass it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout noticing either of us, Mr. Luker slowly made his way to the\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94now in the thickest, now in the thinnest part of the crowd. I\r\ndistinctly saw his hand move, as he passed a short, stout man,\r\nrespectably dressed in a suit of sober grey. The man started a little,\r\nand looked after him. Mr. Luker moved on slowly through the crowd. At\r\nthe door his guard placed themselves on either side of him. They were\r\nall three followed by one of Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s men\xe2\x80\x94and I saw them no more.\r\n\r\nI looked round at the lawyer, and then looked significantly towards the\r\nman in the suit of sober grey. \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mr. Bruff, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned about, in search of his second man. The second man was\r\nnowhere to be seen. He looked behind him for his attendant sprite.\r\nGooseberry had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have both\r\nleft us at the very time when we want them most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt came to the turn of the man in the grey suit to transact his\r\nbusiness at the counter. He paid in a cheque\xe2\x80\x94received a receipt for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and turned to go out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9c_We_ can\xe2\x80\x99t degrade ourselves by\r\nfollowing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ can!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of that man for ten thousand\r\npounds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mr. Bruff, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of _you_,\r\nfor twice the money. A nice occupation for a man in my position,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nmuttered to himself, as we followed the stranger out of the bank. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it. I should be ruined if it was known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man in the grey suit got into an omnibus, going westward. We got in\r\nafter him. There were latent reserves of youth still left in Mr. Bruff.\r\nI assert it positively\xe2\x80\x94when he took his seat in the omnibus, he\r\nblushed!\r\n\r\nThe man in the grey suit stopped the omnibus, and got out in Oxford\r\nStreet. We followed him again. He went into a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff started. \xe2\x80\x9cMy chemist!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid we have\r\nmade a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe entered the shop. Mr. Bruff and the proprietor exchanged a few words\r\nin private. The lawyer joined me again, with a very crestfallen face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s greatly to our credit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he took my arm, and led me\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s one comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to our credit?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blake! you and I are the two worst amateur detectives that ever\r\ntried their hands at the trade. The man in the grey suit has been\r\nthirty years in the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s service. He was sent to the bank to pay\r\nmoney to his master\xe2\x80\x99s account\xe2\x80\x94and he knows no more of the Moonstone\r\nthan the babe unborn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked what was to be done next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back to my office,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cGooseberry, and my second\r\nman, have evidently followed somebody else. Let us hope that _they_ had\r\ntheir eyes about them at any rate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn Square, the second man had arrived there\r\nbefore us. He had been waiting for more than a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have made a mistake.\r\nI could have taken my oath that I saw Mr. Luker pass something to an\r\nelderly gentleman, in a light-coloured paletot. The elderly gentleman\r\nturns out, sir, to be a most respectable master iron-monger in\r\nEastcheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Gooseberry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bruff resignedly.\r\n\r\nThe man stared. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir. I have seen nothing of him since I\r\nleft the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bruff dismissed the man. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of two things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither Gooseberry has run away, or he is hunting on his own account.\r\nWhat do you say to dining here, on the chance that the boy may come\r\nback in an hour or two? I have got some good wine in the cellar, and we\r\ncan get a chop from the coffee-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe dined at Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s chambers. Before the cloth was removed, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x9d was announced as wanting to speak to the lawyer. Was the person\r\nGooseberry? No: only the man who had been employed to follow Mr. Luker\r\nwhen he left the bank.\r\n\r\nThe report, in this case, presented no feature of the slightest\r\ninterest. Mr. Luker had gone back to his own house, and had there\r\ndismissed his guard. He had not gone out again afterwards. Towards\r\ndusk, the shutters had been put up, and the doors had been bolted. The\r\nstreet before the house, and the alley behind the house, had been\r\ncarefully watched. No signs of the Indians had been visible. No person\r\nwhatever had been seen loitering about the premises. Having stated\r\nthese facts, the man waited to know whether there were any further\r\norders. Mr. Bruff dismissed him for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Mr. Luker has taken the Moonstone home with him?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bruff. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would never have dismissed his two\r\npolicemen, if he had run the risk of keeping the Diamond in his own\r\nhouse again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe waited another half-hour for the boy, and waited in vain. It was\r\nthen time for Mr. Bruff to go to Hampstead, and for me to return to\r\nRachel in Portland Place. I left my card, in charge of the porter at\r\nthe chambers, with a line written on it to say that I should be at my\r\nlodgings at half past ten, that night. The card was to be given to the\r\nboy, if the boy came back.\r\n\r\nSome men have a knack of keeping appointments; and other men have a\r\nknack of missing them. I am one of the other men. Add to this, that I\r\npassed the evening at Portland Place, on the same seat with Rachel, in\r\na room forty feet long, with Mrs. Merridew at the further end of it.\r\nDoes anybody wonder that I got home at half past twelve instead of half\r\npast ten? How thoroughly heartless that person must be! And how\r\nearnestly I hope I may never make that person\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance!\r\n\r\nMy servant handed me a morsel of paper when he let me in.\r\n\r\nI read, in a neat legal handwriting, these words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir, I\r\nam getting sleepy. I will come back tomorrow morning, between nine and\r\nten.\xe2\x80\x9d Inquiry proved that a boy, with very extraordinary-looking eyes,\r\nhad called, and presented my card and message, had waited an hour, had\r\ndone nothing but fall asleep and wake up again, had written a line for\r\nme, and had gone home\xe2\x80\x94after gravely informing the servant that \xe2\x80\x9che was\r\nfit for nothing unless he got his night\xe2\x80\x99s rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt nine, the next morning, I was ready for my visitor. At half past\r\nnine, I heard steps outside my door. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Gooseberry!\xe2\x80\x9d I called\r\nout. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a grave and melancholy voice. The door\r\nopened. I started to my feet, and confronted\xe2\x80\x94Sergeant Cuff!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would look in here, Mr. Blake, on the chance of your being\r\nin town, before I wrote to Yorkshire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant.\r\n\r\nHe was as dreary and as lean as ever. His eyes had not lost their old\r\ntrick (so subtly noticed in Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s Narrative) of \xe2\x80\x9clooking as if\r\nthey expected something more from you than you were aware of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut, so far as dress can alter a man, the great Cuff was changed beyond\r\nall recognition. He wore a broad-brimmed white hat, a light shooting\r\njacket, white trousers, and drab gaiters. He carried a stout oak stick.\r\nHis whole aim and object seemed to be to look as if he had lived in the\r\ncountry all his life. When I complimented him on his Metamorphosis, he\r\ndeclined to take it as a joke. He complained, quite gravely, of the\r\nnoises and the smells of London. I declare I am far from sure that he\r\ndid not speak with a slightly rustic accent! I offered him breakfast.\r\nThe innocent countryman was quite shocked. _His_ breakfast hour was\r\nhalf-past six\xe2\x80\x94and _he_ went to bed with the cocks and hens!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only got back from Ireland last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, coming\r\nround to the practical object of his visit, in his own impenetrable\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I went to bed, I read your letter, telling me what has\r\nhappened since my inquiry after the Diamond was suspended last year.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing to be said about the matter on my side. I\r\ncompletely mistook my case. How any man living was to have seen things\r\nin their true light, in such a situation as mine was at the time, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t profess to know. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t alter the facts as they stand.\r\nI own that I made a mess of it. Not the first mess, Mr. Blake, which\r\nhas distinguished my professional career! It\xe2\x80\x99s only in books that the\r\nofficers of the detective force are superior to the weakness of making\r\na mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have come in the nick of time to recover your reputation,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I have\r\nretired from business, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a straw about my reputation. I have\r\ndone with my reputation, thank God! I am here, sir, in grateful\r\nremembrance of the late Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s liberality to me. I will go\r\nback to my old work\xe2\x80\x94if you want me, and if you will trust me\xe2\x80\x94on that\r\nconsideration, and on no other. Not a farthing of money is to pass, if\r\nyou please, from you to me. This is on honour. Now tell me, Mr. Blake,\r\nhow the case stands since you wrote to me last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him of the experiment with the opium, and of what had occurred\r\nafterwards at the bank in Lombard Street. He was greatly struck by the\r\nexperiment\xe2\x80\x94it was something entirely new in his experience. And he was\r\nparticularly interested in the theory of Ezra Jennings, relating to\r\nwhat I had done with the Diamond, after I had left Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting-room, on the birthday night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with Mr. Jennings that you hid the Moonstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSergeant Cuff. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I agree with him, that you must certainly have\r\ntaken it back to your own room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what happened then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no suspicion yourself of what happened, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr. Bruff no suspicion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff rose, and went to my writing-table. He came back with a\r\nsealed envelope. It was marked \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate;\xe2\x80\x9d it was addressed to me; and\r\nit had the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s signature in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspected the wrong person, last year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cand I may be\r\nsuspecting the wrong person now. Wait to open the envelope, Mr. Blake,\r\ntill you have got at the truth. And then compare the name of the guilty\r\nperson, with the name that I have written in that sealed letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put the letter into my pocket\xe2\x80\x94and then asked for the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion of the measures which we had taken at the bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well intended, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand quite the right thing to\r\ndo. But there was another person who ought to have been looked after\r\nbesides Mr. Luker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person named in the letter you have just given to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Blake, the person named in the letter. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped\r\nnow. I shall have something to propose to you and Mr. Bruff, sir, when\r\nthe time comes. Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait, first, and see if the boy has anything to\r\ntell us that is worth hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was close on ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the boy had not made his appearance.\r\nSergeant Cuff talked of other matters. He asked after his old friend\r\nBetteredge, and his old enemy the gardener. In a minute more, he would\r\nno doubt have got from this, to the subject of his favourite roses, if\r\nmy servant had not interrupted us by announcing that the boy was below.\r\n\r\nOn being brought into the room, Gooseberry stopped at the threshold of\r\nthe door, and looked distrustfully at the stranger who was in my\r\ncompany. I told the boy to come to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may speak before this gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is here to assist\r\nme; and he knows all that has happened. Sergeant Cuff,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nis the boy from Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn our modern system of civilisation, celebrity (no matter of what\r\nkind) is the lever that will move anything. The fame of the great Cuff\r\nhad even reached the ears of the small Gooseberry. The boy\xe2\x80\x99s ill-fixed\r\neyes rolled, when I mentioned the illustrious name, till I thought they\r\nreally must have dropped on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cand let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what you have\r\ngot to tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notice of the great man\xe2\x80\x94the hero of many a famous story in every\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s office in London\xe2\x80\x94appeared to fascinate the boy. He placed\r\nhimself in front of Sergeant Cuff, and put his hands behind him, after\r\nthe approved fashion of a neophyte who is examined in his catechism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, beginning with the first\r\nquestion in the catechism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctavius Guy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey call me Gooseberry at the\r\noffice because of my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOctavius Guy, otherwise Gooseberry,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Sergeant, with the\r\nutmost gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were missed at the bank yesterday. What were you\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir, I was following a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tall man, sir, with a big black beard, dressed like a sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember the man!\xe2\x80\x9d I broke in. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bruff and I thought he was a spy\r\nemployed by the Indians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff did not appear to be much impressed by what Mr. Bruff and\r\nI had thought. He went on catechising Gooseberry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand why did you follow the sailor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir, Mr. Bruff wanted to know whether Mr. Luker passed\r\nanything to anybody on his way out of the bank. I saw Mr. Luker pass\r\nsomething to the sailor with the black beard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell Mr. Bruff what you saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to tell anybody, sir, the sailor went out in such a\r\nhurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you ran out after him\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGooseberry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, patting his head, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have got\r\nsomething in that small skull of yours\xe2\x80\x94and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t cotton-wool. I am\r\ngreatly pleased with you, so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy blushed with pleasure. Sergeant Cuff went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? and what did the sailor do, when he got into the street?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe called a cab, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeld on behind, and run after it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the Sergeant could put his next question, another visitor was\r\nannounced\xe2\x80\x94the head clerk from Mr. Bruff\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\nFeeling the importance of not interrupting Sergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s examination\r\nof the boy, I received the clerk in another room. He came with bad news\r\nof his employer. The agitation and excitement of the last two days had\r\nproved too much for Mr. Bruff. He had awoke that morning with an attack\r\nof gout; he was confined to his room at Hampstead; and, in the present\r\ncritical condition of our affairs, he was very uneasy at being\r\ncompelled to leave me without the advice and assistance of an\r\nexperienced person. The chief clerk had received orders to hold himself\r\nat my disposal, and was willing to do his best to replace Mr. Bruff.\r\n\r\nI wrote at once to quiet the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mind, by telling him of\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s visit: adding that Gooseberry was at that moment under\r\nexamination; and promising to inform Mr. Bruff, either personally, or\r\nby letter, of whatever might occur later in the day. Having despatched\r\nthe clerk to Hampstead with my note, I returned to the room which I had\r\nleft, and found Sergeant Cuff at the fireplace, in the act of ringing\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just going to\r\nsend word by your servant that I wanted to speak to you. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ndoubt on my mind that this boy\xe2\x80\x94this most meritorious boy,\xe2\x80\x9d added the\r\nSergeant, patting Gooseberry on the head, \xe2\x80\x9chas followed the right man.\r\nPrecious time has been lost, sir, through your unfortunately not being\r\nat home at half past ten last night. The only thing to do, now, is to\r\nsend for a cab immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn five minutes more, Sergeant Cuff and I (with Gooseberry on the box\r\nto guide the driver) were on our way eastward, towards the City.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, pointing through the front\r\nwindow of the cab, \xe2\x80\x9cthat boy will do great things in my late\r\nprofession. He is the brightest and cleverest little chap I have met\r\nwith, for many a long year past. You shall hear the substance, Mr.\r\nBlake, of what he told me while you were out of the room. You were\r\npresent, I think, when he mentioned that he held on behind the cab, and\r\nran after it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, the cab went from Lombard Street to the Tower Wharf. The\r\nsailor with the black beard got out, and spoke to the steward of the\r\nRotterdam steamboat, which was to start next morning. He asked if he\r\ncould be allowed to go on board at once, and sleep in his berth\r\nover-night. The steward said, No. The cabins, and berths, and bedding\r\nwere all to have a thorough cleaning that evening, and no passenger\r\ncould be allowed to come on board, before the morning. The sailor\r\nturned round, and left the wharf. When he got into the street again,\r\nthe boy noticed for the first time, a man dressed like a respectable\r\nmechanic, walking on the opposite side of the road, and apparently\r\nkeeping the sailor in view. The sailor stopped at an eating-house in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and went in. The boy\xe2\x80\x94not being able to make up his\r\nmind, at the moment\xe2\x80\x94hung about among some other boys, staring at the\r\ngood things in the eating-house window. He noticed the mechanic\r\nwaiting, as he himself was waiting\xe2\x80\x94but still on the opposite side of\r\nthe street. After a minute, a cab came by slowly, and stopped where the\r\nmechanic was standing. The boy could only see plainly one person in the\r\ncab, who leaned forward at the window to speak to the mechanic. He\r\ndescribed that person, Mr. Blake, without any prompting from me, as\r\nhaving a dark face, like the face of an Indian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was plain, by this time, that Mr. Bruff and I had made another\r\nmistake. The sailor with the black beard was clearly not a spy in the\r\nservice of the Indian conspiracy. Was he, by any possibility, the man\r\nwho had got the Diamond?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a little,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cab moved on slowly down\r\nthe street. The mechanic crossed the road, and went into the\r\neating-house. The boy waited outside till he was hungry and tired\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen went into the eating-house, in his turn. He had a shilling in his\r\npocket; and he dined sumptuously, he tells me, on a black-pudding, an\r\neel-pie, and a bottle of ginger-beer. What can a boy _not_ digest? The\r\nsubstance in question has never been found yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he see in the eating-house?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Blake, he saw the sailor reading the newspaper at one table,\r\nand the mechanic reading the newspaper at another. It was dusk before\r\nthe sailor got up, and left the place. He looked about him suspiciously\r\nwhen he got out into the street. The boy\xe2\x80\x94_being_ a boy\xe2\x80\x94passed\r\nunnoticed. The mechanic had not come out yet. The sailor walked on,\r\nlooking about him, and apparently not very certain of where he was\r\ngoing next. The mechanic appeared once more, on the opposite side of\r\nthe road. The sailor went on, till he got to Shore Lane, leading into\r\nLower Thames Street. There he stopped before a public-house, under the\r\nsign of \xe2\x80\x98The Wheel of Fortune,\xe2\x80\x99 and, after examining the place outside,\r\nwent in. Gooseberry went in too. There were a great many people, mostly\r\nof the decent sort, at the bar. \xe2\x80\x98The Wheel of Fortune\xe2\x80\x99 is a very\r\nrespectable house, Mr. Blake; famous for its porter and pork-pies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s digressions irritated me. He saw it; and confined\r\nhimself more strictly to Gooseberry\xe2\x80\x99s evidence when he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sailor,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9casked if he could have a bed. The landlord\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98No; they were full.\xe2\x80\x99 The barmaid corrected him, and said \xe2\x80\x98Number\r\nTen was empty.\xe2\x80\x99 A waiter was sent for to show the sailor to Number Ten.\r\nJust before that, Gooseberry had noticed the mechanic among the people\r\nat the bar. Before the waiter had answered the call, the mechanic had\r\nvanished. The sailor was taken off to his room. Not knowing what to do\r\nnext, Gooseberry had the wisdom to wait and see if anything happened.\r\nSomething did happen. The landlord was called for. Angry voices were\r\nheard upstairs. The mechanic suddenly made his appearance again,\r\ncollared by the landlord, and exhibiting, to Gooseberry\xe2\x80\x99s great\r\nsurprise, all the signs and tokens of being drunk. The landlord thrust\r\nhim out at the door, and threatened him with the police if he came\r\nback. From the altercation between them, while this was going on, it\r\nappeared that the man had been discovered in Number Ten, and had\r\ndeclared with drunken obstinacy that he had taken the room. Gooseberry\r\nwas so struck by this sudden intoxication of a previously sober person,\r\nthat he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist running out after the mechanic into the street.\r\nAs long as he was in sight of the public-house, the man reeled about in\r\nthe most disgraceful manner. The moment he turned the corner of the\r\nstreet, he recovered his balance instantly, and became as sober a\r\nmember of society as you could wish to see. Gooseberry went back to\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Wheel of Fortune\xe2\x80\x99 in a very bewildered state of mind. He waited\r\nabout again, on the chance of something happening. Nothing happened;\r\nand nothing more was to be heard, or seen, of the sailor. Gooseberry\r\ndecided on going back to the office. Just as he came to this\r\nconclusion, who should appear, on the opposite side of the street as\r\nusual, but the mechanic again! He looked up at one particular window at\r\nthe top of the public-house, which was the only one that had a light in\r\nit. The light seemed to relieve his mind. He left the place directly.\r\nThe boy made his way back to Gray\xe2\x80\x99s Inn\xe2\x80\x94got your card and\r\nmessage\xe2\x80\x94called\xe2\x80\x94and failed to find you. There you have the state of the\r\ncase, Mr. Blake, as it stands at the present time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your own opinion of the case, Sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s serious, sir. Judging by what the boy saw, the Indians\r\nare in it, to begin with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And the sailor is evidently the person to whom Mr. Luker passed\r\nthe Diamond. It seems odd that Mr. Bruff, and I, and the man in Mr.\r\nBruff\xe2\x80\x99s employment, should all have been mistaken about who the person\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, Mr. Blake. Considering the risk that person ran, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlikely enough that Mr. Luker purposely misled you, by previous\r\narrangement between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand the proceedings at the public-house?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nman dressed like a mechanic was acting of course in the employment of\r\nthe Indians. But I am as much puzzled to account for his sudden\r\nassumption of drunkenness as Gooseberry himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can give a guess at what it means, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will reflect, you will see that the man must have had some\r\npretty strict instructions from the Indians. They were far too\r\nnoticeable themselves to risk being seen at the bank, or in the\r\npublic-house\xe2\x80\x94they were obliged to trust everything to their deputy.\r\nVery good. Their deputy hears a certain number named in the\r\npublic-house, as the number of the room which the sailor is to have for\r\nthe night\xe2\x80\x94that being also the room (unless our notion is all wrong)\r\nwhich the Diamond is to have for the night, too. Under those\r\ncircumstances, the Indians, you may rely on it, would insist on having\r\na description of the room\xe2\x80\x94of its position in the house, of its\r\ncapability of being approached from the outside, and so on. What was\r\nthe man to do, with such orders as these? Just what he did! He ran\r\nupstairs to get a look at the room, before the sailor was taken into\r\nit. He was found there, making his observations\xe2\x80\x94and he shammed drunk,\r\nas the easiest way of getting out of the difficulty. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I read\r\nthe riddle. After he was turned out of the public-house, he probably\r\nwent with his report to the place where his employers were waiting for\r\nhim. And his employers, no doubt, sent him back to make sure that the\r\nsailor was really settled at the public-house till the next morning. As\r\nfor what happened at \xe2\x80\x98The Wheel of Fortune,\xe2\x80\x99 after the boy left\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nought to have discovered that last night. It\xe2\x80\x99s eleven in the morning,\r\nnow. We must hope for the best, and find out what we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour more, the cab stopped in Shore Lane, and\r\nGooseberry opened the door for us to get out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the boy.\r\n\r\nThe moment we entered \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wheel of Fortune\xe2\x80\x9d it was plain even to my\r\ninexperienced eyes that there was something wrong in the house.\r\n\r\nThe only person behind the counter at which the liquors were served,\r\nwas a bewildered servant girl, perfectly ignorant of the business. One\r\nor two customers, waiting for their morning drink, were tapping\r\nimpatiently on the counter with their money. The barmaid appeared from\r\nthe inner regions of the parlour, excited and preoccupied. She answered\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry for the landlord, by telling him sharply that\r\nher master was upstairs, and was not to be bothered by anybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along with me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, coolly leading the way\r\nupstairs, and beckoning to the boy to follow him.\r\n\r\nThe barmaid called to her master, and warned him that strangers were\r\nintruding themselves into the house. On the first floor we were\r\nencountered by the landlord, hurrying down, in a highly irritated\r\nstate, to see what was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil are you? and what do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you who I am\r\nto begin with. I am Sergeant Cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe illustrious name instantly produced its effect. The angry landlord\r\nthrew open the door of a sitting-room, and asked the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s pardon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am annoyed and out of sorts, sir\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething unpleasant has happened in the house this morning. A man in\r\nmy way of business has a deal to upset his temper, Sergeant Cuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come at once, if you will\r\nallow me, to what brings us here. This gentleman and I want to trouble\r\nyou with a few inquiries, on a matter of some interest to both of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelating to what, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelating to a dark man, dressed like a sailor, who slept here last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! that\xe2\x80\x99s the man who is upsetting the whole house at this\r\nmoment!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you, or does this gentleman know\r\nanything about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t be certain till we see him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee him?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing that nobody has\r\nbeen able to do since seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning. That was the time\r\nwhen he left word, last night, that he was to be called. He _was_\r\ncalled\xe2\x80\x94and there was no getting an answer from him, and no opening his\r\ndoor to see what was the matter. They tried again at eight, and they\r\ntried again at nine. No use! There was the door still locked\xe2\x80\x94and not a\r\nsound to be heard in the room! I have been out this morning\xe2\x80\x94and I only\r\ngot back a quarter of an hour ago. I have hammered at the door\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94and all to no purpose. The potboy has gone to fetch a carpenter.\r\nIf you can wait a few minutes, gentlemen, we will have the door opened,\r\nand see what it means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the man drunk last night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sergeant Cuff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly sober, sir\xe2\x80\x94or I would never have let him sleep in my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he pay for his bed beforehand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould he leave the room in any way, without going out by the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe room is a garret,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a trap-door in\r\nthe ceiling, leading out on to the roof\xe2\x80\x94and a little lower down the\r\nstreet, there\xe2\x80\x99s an empty house under repair. Do you think, Sergeant,\r\nthe blackguard has got off in that way, without paying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sailor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sergeant Cuff, \xe2\x80\x9cmight have done it\xe2\x80\x94early in the\r\nmorning, before the street was astir. He would be used to climbing, and\r\nhis head wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fail him on the roofs of the houses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the arrival of the carpenter was announced. We all went\r\nupstairs, at once, to the top story. I noticed that the Sergeant was\r\nunusually grave, even for _him_. It also struck me as odd that he told\r\nthe boy (after having previously encouraged him to follow us), to wait\r\nin the room below till we came down again.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s hammer and chisel disposed of the resistance of the\r\ndoor in a few minutes. But some article of furniture had been placed\r\nagainst it inside, as a barricade. By pushing at the door, we thrust\r\nthis obstacle aside, and so got admission to the room. The landlord\r\nentered first; the Sergeant second; and I third. The other persons\r\npresent followed us.\r\n\r\nWe all looked towards the bed, and all started.\r\n\r\nThe man had not left the room. He lay, dressed, on the bed\xe2\x80\x94with a white\r\npillow over his face, which completely hid it from view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, pointing to the pillow.\r\n\r\nSergeant Cuff led the way to the bed, without answering, and removed\r\nthe pillow.\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s swarthy face was placid and still; his black hair and beard\r\nwere slightly, very slightly, discomposed. His eyes stared wide-open,\r\nglassy and vacant, at the ceiling. The filmy look and the fixed\r\nexpression of them horrified me. I turned away, and went to the open\r\nwindow. The rest of them remained, where Sergeant Cuff remained, at the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in a fit!\xe2\x80\x9d I heard the landlord say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sergeant answered. \xe2\x80\x9cSend for the nearest doctor, and\r\nsend for the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter was despatched on both errands. Some strange fascination\r\nseemed to hold Sergeant Cuff to the bed. Some strange curiosity seemed\r\nto keep the rest of them waiting, to see what the Sergeant would do\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nI turned again to the window. The moment afterwards, I felt a soft pull\r\nat my coat-tails, and a small voice whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGooseberry had followed us into the room. His loose eyes rolled\r\nfrightfully\xe2\x80\x94not in terror, but in exultation. He had made a\r\ndetective-discovery on his own account. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated\xe2\x80\x94and led me to a table in the corner of the room.\r\n\r\nOn the table stood a little wooden box, open, and empty. On one side of\r\nthe box lay some jewellers\xe2\x80\x99 cotton. On the other side, was a torn sheet\r\nof white paper, with a seal on it, partly destroyed, and with an\r\ninscription in writing, which was still perfectly legible. The\r\ninscription was in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeposited with Messrs. Bushe, Lysaught, and Bushe, by Mr. Septimus\r\nLuker, of Middlesex Place, Lambeth, a small wooden box, sealed up in\r\nthis envelope, and containing a valuable of great price. The box, when\r\nclaimed, to be only given up by Messrs. Bushe and Co. on the personal\r\napplication of Mr. Luker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose lines removed all further doubt, on one point at least. The\r\nsailor had been in possession of the Moonstone, when he had left the\r\nbank on the previous day.\r\n\r\nI felt another pull at my coat-tails. Gooseberry had not done with me\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobbery!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the boy, pointing, in high delight, to the empty\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were told to wait downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Murder!\xe2\x80\x9d added Gooseberry, pointing, with a keener relish still,\r\nto the man on the bed.\r\n\r\nThere was something so hideous in the boy\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment of the horror of\r\nthe scene, that I took him by the two shoulders and put him out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I crossed the threshold of the door, I heard\r\nSergeant Cuff\xe2\x80\x99s voice, asking where I was. He met me, as I returned\r\ninto the room, and forced me to go back with him to the bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Blake!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the man\xe2\x80\x99s face. It is a face\r\ndisguised\xe2\x80\x94and here\xe2\x80\x99s the proof of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe traced with his finger a thin line of livid white, running backward\r\nfrom the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, between the swarthy complexion, and the\r\nslightly-disturbed black hair. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see what is under this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSergeant, suddenly seizing the black hair, with a firm grip of his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nMy nerves were not strong enough to bear it. I turned away again from\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\nThe first sight that met my eyes, at the other end of the room, was the\r\nirrepressible Gooseberry, perched on a chair, and looking with\r\nbreathless interest, over the heads of his elders, at the Sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s pulling off his wig!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Gooseberry, compassionating my\r\nposition, as the only person in the room who could see nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause\xe2\x80\x94and then a cry of astonishment among the people round\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s pulled off his beard!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gooseberry.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause\xe2\x80\x94Sergeant Cuff asked for something. The landlord\r\nwent to the wash-hand-stand, and returned to the bed with a basin of\r\nwater and a towel.\r\n\r\nGooseberry danced with excitement on the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up here, along\r\nwith me, sir! He\xe2\x80\x99s washing off his complexion now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant suddenly burst his way through the people about him, and\r\ncame, with horror in his face, straight to the place where I was\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back to the bed, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. He looked at me closer, and\r\nchecked himself \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the sealed letter first\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nletter I gave you this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead the name, Mr. Blake, that I have written inside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI read the name that he had written. It was\xe2\x80\x94_Godfrey Ablewhite_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9ccome with me, and look at the man on the\r\nbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went with him, and looked at the man on the bed.\r\n\r\nGODFREY ABLEWHITE!\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Sergeant Cuff._\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDorking, Surrey, July 30th, 1849. To Franklin Blake, Esq. Sir,\xe2\x80\x94I beg to\r\napologise for the delay that has occurred in the production of the\r\nReport, with which I engaged to furnish you. I have waited to make it a\r\ncomplete Report; and I have been met, here and there, by obstacles\r\nwhich it was only possible to remove by some little expenditure of\r\npatience and time.\r\n\r\nThe object which I proposed to myself has now, I hope, been attained.\r\nYou will find, in these pages, answers to the greater part\xe2\x80\x94if not\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94of the questions, concerning the late Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite, which\r\noccurred to your mind when I last had the honour of seeing you.\r\n\r\nI propose to tell you\xe2\x80\x94in the first place\xe2\x80\x94what is known of the manner in\r\nwhich your cousin met his death; appending to the statement such\r\ninferences and conclusions as we are justified (according to my\r\nopinion) in drawing from the facts.\r\n\r\nI shall then endeavour\xe2\x80\x94in the second place\xe2\x80\x94to put you in possession of\r\nsuch discoveries as I have made, respecting the proceedings of Mr.\r\nGodfrey Ablewhite, before, during and after the time, when you and he\r\nmet as guests at the late Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s country house.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs to your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s death, then, first.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be established, beyond any reasonable doubt, that he was\r\nkilled (while he was asleep, or immediately on his waking) by being\r\nsmothered with a pillow from his bed\xe2\x80\x94that the persons guilty of\r\nmurdering him are the three Indians\xe2\x80\x94and that the object contemplated\r\n(and achieved) by the crime, was to obtain possession of the diamond,\r\ncalled the Moonstone.\r\n\r\nThe facts from which this conclusion is drawn, are derived partly from\r\nan examination of the room at the tavern; and partly from the evidence\r\nobtained at the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Inquest.\r\n\r\nOn forcing the door of the room, the deceased gentleman was discovered,\r\ndead, with the pillow of the bed over his face. The medical man who\r\nexamined him, being informed of this circumstance, considered the\r\npost-mortem appearances as being perfectly compatible with murder by\r\nsmothering\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, with murder committed by some person, or\r\npersons, pressing the pillow over the nose and mouth of the deceased,\r\nuntil death resulted from congestion of the lungs.\r\n\r\nNext, as to the motive for the crime.\r\n\r\nA small box, with a sealed paper torn off from it (the paper containing\r\nan inscription) was found open, and empty, on a table in the room. Mr.\r\nLuker has himself personally identified the box, the seal, and the\r\ninscription. He has declared that the box did actually contain the\r\ndiamond, called the Moonstone; and he has admitted having given the box\r\n(thus sealed up) to Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite (then concealed under a\r\ndisguise), on the afternoon of the twenty-sixth of June last. The fair\r\ninference from all this is, that the stealing of the Moonstone was the\r\nmotive of the crime.\r\n\r\nNext, as to the manner in which the crime was committed.\r\n\r\nOn examination of the room (which is only seven feet high), a trap-door\r\nin the ceiling, leading out on to the roof of the house, was discovered\r\nopen. The short ladder, used for obtaining access to the trap-door (and\r\nkept under the bed), was found placed at the opening, so as to enable\r\nany person or persons, in the room, to leave it again easily. In the\r\ntrap-door itself was found a square aperture cut in the wood,\r\napparently with some exceedingly sharp instrument, just behind the bolt\r\nwhich fastened the door on the inner side. In this way, any person from\r\nthe outside could have drawn back the bolt, and opened the door, and\r\nhave dropped (or have been noiselessly lowered by an accomplice) into\r\nthe room\xe2\x80\x94its height, as already observed, being only seven feet. That\r\nsome person, or persons, must have got admission in this way, appears\r\nevident from the fact of the aperture being there. As to the manner in\r\nwhich he (or they) obtained access to the roof of the tavern, it is to\r\nbe remarked that the third house, lower down in the street, was empty,\r\nand under repair\xe2\x80\x94that a long ladder was left by the workmen, leading\r\nfrom the pavement to the top of the house\xe2\x80\x94and that, on returning to\r\ntheir work, on the morning of the 27th, the men found the plank which\r\nthey had tied to the ladder, to prevent anyone from using it in their\r\nabsence, removed, and lying on the ground. As to the possibility of\r\nascending by this ladder, passing over the roofs of the houses, passing\r\nback, and descending again, unobserved\xe2\x80\x94it is discovered, on the\r\nevidence of the night policeman, that he only passes through Shore Lane\r\ntwice in an hour, when out on his beat. The testimony of the\r\ninhabitants also declares, that Shore Lane, after midnight, is one of\r\nthe quietest and loneliest streets in London. Here again, therefore, it\r\nseems fair to infer that\xe2\x80\x94with ordinary caution, and presence of\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94any man, or men, might have ascended by the ladder, and might have\r\ndescended again, unobserved. Once on the roof of the tavern, it has\r\nbeen proved, by experiment, that a man might cut through the trap-door,\r\nwhile lying down on it, and that in such a position, the parapet in\r\nfront of the house would conceal him from the view of anyone passing in\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to the person, or persons, by whom the crime was committed.\r\n\r\nIt is known (1) that the Indians had an interest in possessing\r\nthemselves of the Diamond. (2) It is at least probable that the man\r\nlooking like an Indian, whom Octavius Guy saw at the window of the cab,\r\nspeaking to the man dressed like a mechanic, was one of the three\r\nHindoo conspirators. (3) It is certain that this same man dressed like\r\na mechanic, was seen keeping Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite in view, all through\r\nthe evening of the 26th, and was found in the bedroom (before Mr.\r\nAblewhite was shown into it) under circumstances which lead to the\r\nsuspicion that he was examining the room. (4) A morsel of torn gold\r\nthread was picked up in the bedroom, which persons expert in such\r\nmatters, declare to be of Indian manufacture, and to be a species of\r\ngold thread not known in England. (5) On the morning of the 27th, three\r\nmen, answering to the description of the three Indians, were observed\r\nin Lower Thames Street, were traced to the Tower Wharf, and were seen\r\nto leave London by the steamer bound for Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nThere is here, moral, if not legal, evidence, that the murder was\r\ncommitted by the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhether the man personating a mechanic was, or was not, an accomplice\r\nin the crime, it is impossible to say. That he could have committed the\r\nmurder alone, seems beyond the limits of probability. Acting by\r\nhimself, he could hardly have smothered Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x94who was the\r\ntaller and stronger man of the two\xe2\x80\x94without a struggle taking place, or\r\na cry being heard. A servant girl, sleeping in the next room, heard\r\nnothing. The landlord, sleeping in the room below, heard nothing. The\r\nwhole evidence points to the inference that more than one man was\r\nconcerned in this crime\xe2\x80\x94and the circumstances, I repeat, morally\r\njustify the conclusion that the Indians committed it.\r\n\r\nI have only to add, that the verdict at the Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Inquest was\r\nWilful Murder against some person, or persons, unknown. Mr. Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily have offered a reward, and no effort has been left untried to\r\ndiscover the guilty persons. The man dressed like a mechanic has eluded\r\nall inquiries. The Indians have been traced. As to the prospect of\r\nultimately capturing these last, I shall have a word to say to you on\r\nthat head, when I reach the end of the present Report.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, having now written all that is needful on the subject\r\nof Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s death, I may pass next to the narrative of\r\nhis proceedings before, during, and after the time, when you and he met\r\nat the late Lady Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWith regard to the subject now in hand, I may state, at the outset,\r\nthat Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s life had two sides to it.\r\n\r\nThe side turned up to the public view, presented the spectacle of a\r\ngentleman, possessed of considerable reputation as a speaker at\r\ncharitable meetings, and endowed with administrative abilities, which\r\nhe placed at the disposal of various Benevolent Societies, mostly of\r\nthe female sort. The side kept hidden from the general notice,\r\nexhibited this same gentleman in the totally different character of a\r\nman of pleasure, with a villa in the suburbs which was not taken in his\r\nown name, and with a lady in the villa, who was not taken in his own\r\nname, either.\r\n\r\nMy investigations in the villa have shown me several fine pictures and\r\nstatues; furniture tastefully selected, and admirably made; and a\r\nconservatory of the rarest flowers, the match of which it would not be\r\neasy to find in all London. My investigation of the lady has resulted\r\nin the discovery of jewels which are worthy to take rank with the\r\nflowers, and of carriages and horses which have (deservedly) produced a\r\nsensation in the Park, among persons well qualified to judge of the\r\nbuild of the one, and the breed of the others.\r\n\r\nAll this is, so far, common enough. The villa and the lady are such\r\nfamiliar objects in London life, that I ought to apologise for\r\nintroducing them to notice. But what is not common and not familiar (in\r\nmy experience), is that all these fine things were not only ordered,\r\nbut paid for. The pictures, the statues, the flowers, the jewels, the\r\ncarriages, and the horses\xe2\x80\x94inquiry proved, to my indescribable\r\nastonishment, that not a sixpence of debt was owing on any of them. As\r\nto the villa, it had been bought, out and out, and settled on the lady.\r\n\r\nI might have tried to find the right reading of this riddle, and tried\r\nin vain\xe2\x80\x94but for Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s death, which caused an inquiry\r\nto be made into the state of his affairs.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry elicited these facts:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was entrusted with the care of a sum of\r\ntwenty thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94as one of two Trustees for a young gentleman,\r\nwho was still a minor in the year eighteen hundred and forty-eight.\r\nThat the Trust was to lapse, and that the young gentleman was to\r\nreceive the twenty thousand pounds on the day when he came of age, in\r\nthe month of February, eighteen hundred and fifty. That, pending the\r\narrival of this period, an income of six hundred pounds was to be paid\r\nto him by his two Trustees, half-yearly\xe2\x80\x94at Christmas and Midsummer Day.\r\nThat this income was regularly paid by the active Trustee, Mr. Godfrey\r\nAblewhite. That the twenty thousand pounds (from which the income was\r\nsupposed to be derived) had every farthing of it been sold out of the\r\nFunds, at different periods, ending with the end of the year eighteen\r\nhundred and forty-seven. That the power of attorney, authorising the\r\nbankers to sell out the stock, and the various written orders telling\r\nthem what amounts to sell out, were formally signed by both the\r\nTrustees. That the signature of the second Trustee (a retired army\r\nofficer, living in the country) was a signature forged, in every case,\r\nby the active Trustee\xe2\x80\x94otherwise Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite.\r\n\r\nIn these facts lies the explanation of Mr. Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s honourable\r\nconduct, in paying the debts incurred for the lady and the villa\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n(as you will presently see) of more besides.\r\n\r\nWe may now advance to the date of Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s birthday (in the year\r\neighteen hundred and forty-eight)\xe2\x80\x94the twenty-first of June.\r\n\r\nOn the day before, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite arrived at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nand asked (as I know from Mr. Ablewhite, senior, himself) for a loan of\r\nthree hundred pounds. Mark the sum; and remember at the same time, that\r\nthe half-yearly payment to the young gentleman was due on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of the month. Also, that the whole of the young\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s fortune had been spent by his Trustee, by the end of the\r\nyear \xe2\x80\x99forty-seven.\r\n\r\nMr. Ablewhite, senior, refused to lend his son a farthing.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite rode over, with you, to Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s house. A few hours afterwards, Mr. Godfrey (as you yourself\r\nhave told me) made a proposal of marriage to Miss Verinder. Here, he\r\nsaw his way no doubt\xe2\x80\x94if accepted\xe2\x80\x94to the end of all his money anxieties,\r\npresent and future. But, as events actually turned out, what happened?\r\nMiss Verinder refused him.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the birthday, therefore, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npecuniary position was this. He had three hundred pounds to find on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of the month, and twenty thousand pounds to find in\r\nFebruary eighteen hundred and fifty. Failing to raise these sums, at\r\nthese times, he was a ruined man.\r\n\r\nUnder those circumstances, what takes place next?\r\n\r\nYou exasperate Mr. Candy, the doctor, on the sore subject of his\r\nprofession; and he plays you a practical joke, in return, with a dose\r\nof laudanum. He trusts the administration of the dose, prepared in a\r\nlittle phial, to Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\xe2\x80\x94who has himself confessed the\r\nshare he had in the matter, under circumstances which shall presently\r\nbe related to you. Mr. Godfrey is all the readier to enter into the\r\nconspiracy, having himself suffered from your sharp tongue in the\r\ncourse of the evening. He joins Betteredge in persuading you to drink a\r\nlittle brandy and water before you go to bed. He privately drops the\r\ndose of laudanum into your cold grog. And you drink the mixture.\r\n\r\nLet us now shift the scene, if you please to Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s house at\r\nLambeth. And allow me to remark, by way of preface, that Mr. Bruff and\r\nI, together, have found a means of forcing the money-lender to make a\r\nclean breast of it. We have carefully sifted the statement he has\r\naddressed to us; and here it is at your service.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLate on the evening of Friday, the twenty-third of June (\xe2\x80\x99forty-eight),\r\nMr. Luker was surprised by a visit from Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite. He was\r\nmore than surprised, when Mr. Godfrey produced the Moonstone. No such\r\nDiamond (according to Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x99s experience) was in the possession of\r\nany private person in Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite had two modest proposals to make, in relation to\r\nthis magnificent gem. First, Would Mr. Luker be so good as to buy it?\r\nSecondly, Would Mr. Luker (in default of seeing his way to the\r\npurchase) undertake to sell it on commission, and to pay a sum down, on\r\nthe anticipated result?\r\n\r\nMr. Luker tested the Diamond, weighed the Diamond and estimated the\r\nvalue of the Diamond, before he answered a word. _His_ estimate\r\n(allowing for the flaw in the stone) was thirty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nHaving reached that result, Mr. Luker opened his lips, and put a\r\nquestion: \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come by this?\xe2\x80\x9d Only six words! But what volumes\r\nof meaning in them!\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite began a story. Mr. Luker opened his lips again,\r\nand only said three words, this time. \xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite began another story. Mr. Luker wasted no more\r\nwords on him. He got up, and rang the bell for the servant to show the\r\ngentleman out.\r\n\r\nUpon this compulsion, Mr. Godfrey made an effort, and came out with a\r\nnew and amended version of the affair, to the following effect.\r\n\r\nAfter privately slipping the laudanum into your brandy and water, he\r\nwished you good-night, and went into his own room. It was the next room\r\nto yours; and the two had a door of communication between them. On\r\nentering his own room Mr. Godfrey (as he supposed) closed his door. His\r\nmoney troubles kept him awake. He sat, in his dressing-gown and\r\nslippers, for nearly an hour, thinking over his position. Just as he\r\nwas preparing to get into bed, he heard you, talking to yourself, in\r\nyour own room, and going to the door of communication, found that he\r\nhad not shut it as he supposed.\r\n\r\nHe looked into your room to see what was the matter. He discovered you\r\nwith the candle in your hand, just leaving your bedchamber. He heard\r\nyou say to yourself, in a voice quite unlike your own voice, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I\r\nknow? The Indians may be hidden in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp to that time, he had simply supposed himself (in giving you the\r\nlaudanum) to be helping to make you the victim of a harmless practical\r\njoke. It now occurred to him, that the laudanum had taken some effect\r\non you, which had not been foreseen by the doctor, any more than by\r\nhimself. In the fear of an accident happening he followed you softly to\r\nsee what you would do.\r\n\r\nHe followed you to Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, and saw you go in. You\r\nleft the door open. He looked through the crevice thus produced,\r\nbetween the door and the post, before he ventured into the room\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn that position, he not only detected you in taking the Diamond out of\r\nthe drawer\xe2\x80\x94he also detected Miss Verinder, silently watching you from\r\nher bedroom, through her open door. His own eyes satisfied him that\r\n_she_ saw you take the Diamond, too.\r\n\r\nBefore you left the sitting-room again, you hesitated a little. Mr.\r\nGodfrey took advantage of this hesitation to get back again to his\r\nbedroom before you came out, and discovered him. He had barely got\r\nback, before you got back too. You saw him (as he supposes) just as he\r\nwas passing through the door of communication. At any rate, you called\r\nto him in a strange, drowsy voice.\r\n\r\nHe came back to you. You looked at him in a dull sleepy way. You put\r\nthe Diamond into his hand. You said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cTake it back, Godfrey, to\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s bank. It\xe2\x80\x99s safe there\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s not safe here.\xe2\x80\x9d You turned\r\naway unsteadily, and put on your dressing-gown. You sat down in the\r\nlarge arm-chair in your room. You said, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t take it back to the\r\nbank. My head\xe2\x80\x99s like lead\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel my feet under me.\xe2\x80\x9d Your head\r\nsank on the back of the chair\xe2\x80\x94you heaved a heavy sigh\xe2\x80\x94and you fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite went back, with the Diamond, into his own room.\r\nHis statement is, that he came to no conclusion, at that time\xe2\x80\x94except\r\nthat he would wait, and see what happened in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning came, your language and conduct showed that you were\r\nabsolutely ignorant of what you had said and done overnight. At the\r\nsame time, Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s language and conduct showed that she was\r\nresolved to say nothing (in mercy to you) on her side. If Mr. Godfrey\r\nAblewhite chose to keep the Diamond, he might do so with perfect\r\nimpunity. The Moonstone stood between him and ruin. He put the\r\nMoonstone into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThis was the story told by your cousin (under pressure of necessity) to\r\nMr. Luker.\r\n\r\nMr. Luker believed the story to be, as to all main essentials, true\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nthis ground, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was too great a fool to have\r\ninvented it. Mr. Bruff and I agree with Mr. Luker, in considering this\r\ntest of the truth of the story to be a perfectly reliable one.\r\n\r\nThe next question, was the question of what Mr. Luker would do in the\r\nmatter of the Moonstone. He proposed the following terms, as the only\r\nterms on which he would consent to mix himself up with, what was (even\r\nin _his_ line of business) a doubtful and dangerous transaction.\r\n\r\nMr. Luker would consent to lend Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite the sum of two\r\nthousand pounds, on condition that the Moonstone was to be deposited\r\nwith him as a pledge. If, at the expiration of one year from that date,\r\nMr. Godfrey Ablewhite paid three thousand pounds to Mr. Luker, he was\r\nto receive back the Diamond, as a pledge redeemed. If he failed to\r\nproduce the money at the expiration of the year, the pledge (otherwise\r\nthe Moonstone) was to be considered as forfeited to Mr. Luker\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nwould, in this latter case, generously make Mr. Godfrey a present of\r\ncertain promissory notes of his (relating to former dealings) which\r\nwere then in the money-lender\xe2\x80\x99s possession.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say, that Mr. Godfrey indignantly refused to listen\r\nto these monstrous terms. Mr. Luker thereupon, handed him back the\r\nDiamond, and wished him good-night.\r\n\r\nYour cousin went to the door, and came back again. How was he to be\r\nsure that the conversation of that evening would be kept strictly\r\nsecret between his friend and himself?\r\n\r\nMr. Luker didn\xe2\x80\x99t profess to know how. If Mr. Godfrey had accepted his\r\nterms, Mr. Godfrey would have made him an accomplice, and might have\r\ncounted on his silence as on a certainty. As things were, Mr. Luker\r\nmust be guided by his own interests. If awkward inquiries were made,\r\nhow could he be expected to compromise himself, for the sake of a man\r\nwho had declined to deal with him?\r\n\r\nReceiving this reply, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite did, what all animals\r\n(human and otherwise) do, when they find themselves caught in a trap.\r\nHe looked about him in a state of helpless despair. The day of the\r\nmonth, recorded on a neat little card in a box on the money-lender\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchimney-piece, happened to attract his eye. It was the twenty-third of\r\nJune. On the twenty-fourth he had three hundred pounds to pay to the\r\nyoung gentleman for whom he was trustee, and no chance of raising the\r\nmoney, except the chance that Mr. Luker had offered to him. But for\r\nthis miserable obstacle, he might have taken the Diamond to Amsterdam,\r\nand have made a marketable commodity of it, by having it cut up into\r\nseparate stones. As matters stood, he had no choice but to accept Mr.\r\nLuker\xe2\x80\x99s terms. After all, he had a year at his disposal, in which to\r\nraise the three thousand pounds\xe2\x80\x94and a year is a long time.\r\n\r\nMr. Luker drew out the necessary documents on the spot. When they were\r\nsigned, he gave Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite two cheques. One, dated June\r\n23rd, for three hundred pounds. Another, dated a week on, for the\r\nremaining balance seventeen hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nHow the Moonstone was trusted to the keeping of Mr Luker\xe2\x80\x99s bankers, and\r\nhow the Indians treated Mr. Luker and Mr. Godfrey (after that had been\r\ndone) you know already.\r\n\r\nThe next event in your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s life refers again to Miss Verinder. He\r\nproposed marriage to her for the second time\xe2\x80\x94and (after having being\r\naccepted) he consented, at her request, to consider the marriage as\r\nbroken off. One of his reasons for making this concession has been\r\npenetrated by Mr. Bruff. Miss Verinder had only a life interest in her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s property\xe2\x80\x94and there was no raising the twenty thousand pounds\r\non _that_.\r\n\r\nBut you will say, he might have saved the three thousand pounds, to\r\nredeem the pledged Diamond, if he had married. He might have done so\r\ncertainly\xe2\x80\x94supposing neither his wife, nor her guardians and trustees,\r\nobjected to his anticipating more than half of the income at his\r\ndisposal, for some unknown purpose, in the first year of his marriage.\r\nBut even if he got over this obstacle, there was another waiting for\r\nhim in the background. The lady at the Villa, had heard of his\r\ncontemplated marriage. A superb woman, Mr. Blake, of the sort that are\r\nnot to be trifled with\xe2\x80\x94the sort with the light complexion and the Roman\r\nnose. She felt the utmost contempt for Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite. It would\r\nbe silent contempt, if he made a handsome provision for her. Otherwise,\r\nit would be contempt with a tongue to it. Miss Verinder\xe2\x80\x99s life interest\r\nallowed him no more hope of raising the \xe2\x80\x9cprovision\xe2\x80\x9d than of raising the\r\ntwenty thousand pounds. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry\xe2\x80\x94he really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry,\r\nunder all the circumstances.\r\n\r\nHow he tried his luck again with another lady, and how _that_ marriage\r\nalso broke down on the question of money, you know already. You also\r\nknow of the legacy of five thousand pounds, left to him shortly\r\nafterwards, by one of those many admirers among the soft sex whose good\r\ngraces this fascinating man had contrived to win. That legacy (as the\r\nevent has proved) led him to his death.\r\n\r\nI have ascertained that when he went abroad, on getting his five\r\nthousand pounds, he went to Amsterdam. There he made all the necessary\r\narrangements for having the Diamond cut into separate stones. He came\r\nback (in disguise), and redeemed the Moonstone, on the appointed day. A\r\nfew days were allowed to elapse (as a precaution agreed to by both\r\nparties) before the jewel was actually taken out of the bank. If he had\r\ngot safe with it to Amsterdam, there would have been just time between\r\nJuly \xe2\x80\x99forty-nine, and February \xe2\x80\x99fifty (when the young gentleman came of\r\nage) to cut the Diamond, and to make a marketable commodity (polished\r\nor unpolished) of the separate stones. Judge from this, what motives he\r\nhad to run the risk which he actually ran. It was \xe2\x80\x9cneck or nothing\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith him\xe2\x80\x94if ever it was \xe2\x80\x9cneck or nothing\xe2\x80\x9d with a man yet.\r\n\r\nI have only to remind you, before closing this Report, that there is a\r\nchance of laying hands on the Indians, and of recovering the Moonstone\r\nyet. They are now (there is every reason to believe) on their passage\r\nto Bombay, in an East Indiaman. The ship (barring accidents) will touch\r\nat no other port on her way out; and the authorities at Bombay (already\r\ncommunicated with by letter, overland) will be prepared to board the\r\nvessel, the moment she enters the harbour.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to remain, dear sir, your obedient servant, RICHARD\r\nCUFF (late sergeant in the Detective Force, Scotland Yard, London).*\r\n\r\n* NOTE.\xe2\x80\x94Wherever the Report touches on the events of the birthday, or\r\nof the three days that followed it, compare with Betteredge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nNarrative, chapters viii. to xiii.\r\n\r\nSEVENTH NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_In a Letter from Mr. Candy._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrizinghall, Wednesday, September 26th, 1849.\xe2\x80\x94Dear Mr. Franklin Blake,\r\nyou will anticipate the sad news I have to tell you, on finding your\r\nletter to Ezra Jennings returned to you, unopened, in this enclosure.\r\nHe died in my arms, at sunrise, on Wednesday last.\r\n\r\nI am not to blame for having failed to warn you that his end was at\r\nhand. He expressly forbade me to write to you. \xe2\x80\x9cI am indebted to Mr.\r\nFranklin Blake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor having seen some happy days. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndistress him, Mr. Candy\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t distress him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis sufferings, up to the last six hours of his life, were terrible to\r\nsee. In the intervals of remission, when his mind was clear, I\r\nentreated him to tell me of any relatives of his to whom I might write.\r\nHe asked to be forgiven for refusing anything to _me_. And then he\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94not bitterly\xe2\x80\x94that he would die as he had lived, forgotten and\r\nunknown. He maintained that resolution to the last. There is no hope\r\nnow of making any discoveries concerning him. His story is a blank.\r\n\r\nThe day before he died, he told me where to find all his papers. I\r\nbrought them to him on his bed. There was a little bundle of old\r\nletters which he put aside. There was his unfinished book. There was\r\nhis Diary\xe2\x80\x94in many locked volumes. He opened the volume for this year,\r\nand tore out, one by one, the pages relating to the time when you and\r\nhe were together. \xe2\x80\x9cGive those,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto Mr. Franklin Blake. In\r\nyears to come, he may feel an interest in looking back at what is\r\nwritten there.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he clasped his hands, and prayed God fervently to\r\nbless you, and those dear to you. He said he should like to see you\r\nagain. But the next moment he altered his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered when\r\nI offered to write. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t distress him! I won\xe2\x80\x99t distress him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt his request I next collected the other papers\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, the\r\nbundle of letters, the unfinished book and the volumes of the Diary\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nenclosed them all in one wrapper, sealed with my own seal. \xe2\x80\x9cPromise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will put this into my coffin with your own hand; and\r\nthat you will see that no other hand touches it afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave him my promise. And the promise has been performed.\r\n\r\nHe asked me to do one other thing for him\xe2\x80\x94which it cost me a hard\r\nstruggle to comply with. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet my grave be forgotten. Give me\r\nyour word of honour that you will allow no monument of any sort\xe2\x80\x94not\r\neven the commonest tombstone\xe2\x80\x94to mark the place of my burial. Let me\r\nsleep, nameless. Let me rest, unknown.\xe2\x80\x9d When I tried to plead with him\r\nto alter his resolution, he became for the first, and only time,\r\nviolently agitated. I could not bear to see it; and I gave way. Nothing\r\nbut a little grass mound marks the place of his rest. In time, the\r\ntombstones will rise round it. And the people who come after us will\r\nlook and wonder at the nameless grave.\r\n\r\nAs I have told you, for six hours before his death his sufferings\r\nceased. He dozed a little. I think he dreamed. Once or twice he smiled.\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s name, as I suppose\xe2\x80\x94the name of \xe2\x80\x9cElla\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was often on his lips\r\nat this time. A few minutes before the end he asked me to lift him on\r\nhis pillow, to see the sun rise through the window. He was very weak.\r\nHis head fell on my shoulder. He whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cKiss me!\xe2\x80\x9d I kissed his forehead. On a sudden he lifted his head.\r\nThe sunlight touched his face. A beautiful expression, an angelic\r\nexpression, came over it. He cried out three times, \xe2\x80\x9cPeace! peace!\r\npeace!\xe2\x80\x9d His head sank back again on my shoulder, and the long trouble\r\nof his life was at an end.\r\n\r\nSo he has gone from us. This was, as I think, a great man\xe2\x80\x94though the\r\nworld never knew him. He had the sweetest temper I have ever met with.\r\nThe loss of him makes me feel very lonely. Perhaps I have never been\r\nquite myself since my illness. Sometimes, I think of giving up my\r\npractice, and going away, and trying what some of the foreign baths and\r\nwaters will do for me.\r\n\r\nIt is reported here, that you and Miss Verinder are to be married next\r\nmonth. Please to accept my best congratulations.\r\n\r\nThe pages of my poor friend\xe2\x80\x99s Journal are waiting for you at my\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94sealed up, with your name on the wrapper. I was afraid to trust\r\nthem to the post.\r\n\r\nMy best respects and good wishes attend Miss Verinder. I remain, dear\r\nMr. Franklin Blake, truly yours,\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CANDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\n_Contributed by Gabriel Betteredge._\r\n\r\n\r\nI am the person (as you remember no doubt) who led the way in these\r\npages, and opened the story. I am also the person who is left behind,\r\nas it were, to close the story up.\r\n\r\nLet nobody suppose that I have any last words to say here concerning\r\nthe Indian Diamond. I hold that unlucky jewel in abhorrence\xe2\x80\x94and I refer\r\nyou to other authority than mine, for such news of the Moonstone as you\r\nmay, at the present time, be expected to receive. My purpose, in this\r\nplace, is to state a fact in the history of the family, which has been\r\npassed over by everybody, and which I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow to be disrespectfully\r\nsmothered up in that way. The fact to which I allude is\xe2\x80\x94the marriage of\r\nMiss Rachel and Mr. Franklin Blake. This interesting event took place\r\nat our house in Yorkshire, on Tuesday, October ninth, eighteen hundred\r\nand forty-nine. I had a new suit of clothes on the occasion. And the\r\nmarried couple went to spend the honeymoon in Scotland.\r\n\r\nFamily festivals having been rare enough at our house, since my poor\r\nmistress\xe2\x80\x99s death, I own\xe2\x80\x94on this occasion of the wedding\xe2\x80\x94to having\r\n(towards the latter part of the day) taken a drop too much on the\r\nstrength of it.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever done the same sort of thing yourself you will\r\nunderstand and feel for me. If you have not, you will very likely say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting old man! why does he tell us this?\xe2\x80\x9d The reason why is now\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nHaving, then, taken my drop (bless you! you have got your favourite\r\nvice, too; only your vice isn\xe2\x80\x99t mine, and mine isn\xe2\x80\x99t yours), I next\r\napplied the one infallible remedy\xe2\x80\x94that remedy being, as you know,\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_. Where I opened that unrivalled book, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\r\nWhere the lines of print at last left off running into each other, I\r\nknow, however, perfectly well. It was at page three hundred and\r\neighteen\xe2\x80\x94a domestic bit concerning Robinson Crusoe\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith those Thoughts, I considered my new Engagement, that I had a\r\nWife\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(Observe! so had Mr. Franklin!)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cone Child born\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(Observe again!\r\nthat might yet be Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s case, too!)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand my Wife then\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94What\r\nRobinson Crusoe\xe2\x80\x99s wife did, or did not do, \xe2\x80\x9cthen,\xe2\x80\x9d I felt no desire to\r\ndiscover. I scored the bit about the Child with my pencil, and put a\r\nmorsel of paper for a mark to keep the place; \xe2\x80\x9cLie you there,\xe2\x80\x9d I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctill the marriage of Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel is some months\r\nolder\xe2\x80\x94and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe months passed (more than I had bargained for), and no occasion\r\npresented itself for disturbing that mark in the book. It was not till\r\nthis present month of November, eighteen hundred and fifty, that Mr.\r\nFranklin came into my room, in high good spirits, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge! I have got some news for you! Something is going to happen\r\nin the house, before we are many months older.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it concern the family, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt decidedly concerns the family,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your good lady anything to do with it, if you please, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has a great deal to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, beginning to\r\nlook a little surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word more, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you both!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m heartily glad to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin stared like a person thunderstruck. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I venture to\r\ninquire where you got your information?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI only got mine\r\n(imparted in the strictest secrecy) five minutes since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity of producing _Robinson Crusoe_! Here was a\r\nchance of reading that domestic bit about the child which I had marked\r\non the day of Mr. Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage! I read those miraculous words\r\nwith an emphasis which did them justice, and then I looked him severely\r\nin the face. \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, sir, do you believe in _Robinson Crusoe_?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nasked, with a solemnity, suitable to the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetteredge!\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Franklin, with equal solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m convinced\r\nat last.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook hands with me\xe2\x80\x94and I felt that I had converted him.\r\n\r\nWith the relation of this extraordinary circumstance, my reappearance\r\nin these pages comes to an end. Let nobody laugh at the unique anecdote\r\nhere related. You are welcome to be as merry as you please over\r\neverything else I have written. But when I write of _Robinson Crusoe_,\r\nby the Lord it\xe2\x80\x99s serious\xe2\x80\x94and I request you to take it accordingly!\r\n\r\nWhen this is said, all is said. Ladies and gentlemen, I make my bow,\r\nand shut up the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE FINDING OF THE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n THE STATEMENT OF SERGEANT CUFF\xe2\x80\x99S MAN. (1849.)\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of June last, I received instructions from\r\nSergeant Cuff to follow three men; suspected of murder, and described\r\nas Indians. They had been seen on the Tower Wharf that morning,\r\nembarking on board the steamer bound for Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nI left London by a steamer belonging to another company, which sailed\r\non the morning of Thursday the twenty-eighth. Arriving at Rotterdam, I\r\nsucceeded in finding the commander of the Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s steamer. He\r\ninformed me that the Indians had certainly been passengers on board his\r\nvessel\xe2\x80\x94but as far as Gravesend only. Off that place, one of the three\r\nhad inquired at what time they would reach Calais. On being informed\r\nthat the steamer was bound to Rotterdam, the spokesman of the party\r\nexpressed the greatest surprise and distress at the mistake which he\r\nand his two friends had made. They were all willing (he said) to\r\nsacrifice their passage money, if the commander of the steamer would\r\nonly put them ashore. Commiserating their position, as foreigners in a\r\nstrange land, and knowing no reason for detaining them, the commander\r\nsignalled for a shore boat, and the three men left the vessel.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding of the Indians having been plainly resolved on\r\nbeforehand, as a means of preventing their being traced, I lost no time\r\nin returning to England. I left the steamer at Gravesend, and\r\ndiscovered that the Indians had gone from that place to London. Thence,\r\nI again traced them as having left for Plymouth. Inquiries made at\r\nPlymouth proved that they had sailed, forty-eight hours previously, in\r\nthe _Bewley Castle_, East Indiaman, bound direct to Bombay.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this intelligence, Sergeant Cuff caused the authorities at\r\nBombay to be communicated with, overland\xe2\x80\x94so that the vessel might be\r\nboarded by the police immediately on her entering the port. This step\r\nhaving been taken, my connection with the matter came to an end. I have\r\nheard nothing more of it since that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n THE STATEMENT OF THE CAPTAIN. (1849.)\r\n\r\nI am requested by Sergeant Cuff to set in writing certain facts,\r\nconcerning three men (believed to be Hindoos) who were passengers, last\r\nsummer, in the ship _Bewley Castle_, bound for Bombay direct, under my\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoos joined us at Plymouth. On the passage out I heard no\r\ncomplaint of their conduct. They were berthed in the forward part of\r\nthe vessel. I had but few occasions myself of personally noticing them.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the voyage, we had the misfortune to be becalmed\r\nfor three days and nights, off the coast of India. I have not got the\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s journal to refer to, and I cannot now call to mind the latitude\r\nand longitude. As to our position, therefore, I am only able to state\r\ngenerally that the currents drifted us in towards the land, and that\r\nwhen the wind found us again, we reached our port in twenty-four hours\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of a ship (as all seafaring persons know) becomes\r\nrelaxed in a long calm. The discipline of my ship became relaxed.\r\nCertain gentlemen among the passengers got some of the smaller boats\r\nlowered, and amused themselves by rowing about, and swimming, when the\r\nsun at evening time was cool enough to let them divert themselves in\r\nthat way. The boats when done with ought to have been slung up again in\r\ntheir places. Instead of this they were left moored to the ship\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\nWhat with the heat, and what with the vexation of the weather, neither\r\nofficers nor men seemed to be in heart for their duty while the calm\r\nlasted.\r\n\r\nOn the third night, nothing unusual was heard or seen by the watch on\r\ndeck. When the morning came, the smallest of the boats was missing\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe three Hindoos were next reported to be missing, too.\r\n\r\nIf these men had stolen the boat shortly after dark (which I have no\r\ndoubt they did), we were near enough to the land to make it vain to\r\nsend in pursuit of them, when the discovery was made in the morning. I\r\nhave no doubt they got ashore, in that calm weather (making all due\r\nallowance for fatigue and clumsy rowing), before day-break.\r\n\r\nOn reaching our port, I there learnt, for the first time, the reason\r\nthese passengers had for seizing their opportunity of escaping from the\r\nship. I could only make the same statement to the authorities which I\r\nhave made here. They considered me to blame for allowing the discipline\r\nof the vessel to be relaxed. I have expressed my regret on this score\r\nto them, and to my owners.\r\n\r\nSince that time, nothing has been heard to my knowledge of the three\r\nHindoos. I have no more to add to what is here written.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n THE STATEMENT OF MR. MURTHWAITE. (1850.)\r\n\r\n_(In a letter to Mr. Bruff.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you any recollection, my dear sir, of a semi-savage person whom\r\nyou met out at dinner, in London, in the autumn of \xe2\x80\x99forty-eight? Permit\r\nme to remind you that the person\xe2\x80\x99s name was Murthwaite, and that you\r\nand he had a long conversation together after dinner. The talk related\r\nto an Indian Diamond, called the Moonstone, and to a conspiracy then in\r\nexistence to get possession of the gem.\r\n\r\nSince that time, I have been wandering in Central Asia. Thence I have\r\ndrifted back to the scene of some of my past adventures in the north\r\nand north-west of India. About a fortnight since, I found myself in a\r\ncertain district or province (but little known to Europeans) called\r\nKattiawar.\r\n\r\nHere an adventure befell me, in which (incredible as it may appear) you\r\nare personally interested.\r\n\r\nIn the wild regions of Kattiawar (and how wild they are, you will\r\nunderstand, when I tell you that even the husbandmen plough the land,\r\narmed to the teeth), the population is fanatically devoted to the old\r\nHindoo religion\xe2\x80\x94to the ancient worship of Bramah and Vishnu. The few\r\nMahometan families, thinly scattered about the villages in the\r\ninterior, are afraid to taste meat of any kind. A Mahometan even\r\nsuspected of killing that sacred animal, the cow, is, as a matter of\r\ncourse, put to death without mercy in these parts by the pious Hindoo\r\nneighbours who surround him. To strengthen the religious enthusiasm of\r\nthe people, two of the most famous shrines of Hindoo pilgrimage are\r\ncontained within the boundaries of Kattiawar. One of them is Dwarka,\r\nthe birthplace of the god Krishna. The other is the sacred city of\r\nSomnauth\xe2\x80\x94sacked, and destroyed as long since as the eleventh century,\r\nby the Mahometan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni.\r\n\r\nFinding myself, for the second time, in these romantic regions, I\r\nresolved not to leave Kattiawar, without looking once more on the\r\nmagnificent desolation of Somnauth. At the place where I planned to do\r\nthis, I was (as nearly as I could calculate it) some three days\r\ndistant, journeying on foot, from the sacred city.\r\n\r\nI had not been long on the road, before I noticed that other people\xe2\x80\x94by\r\ntwos and threes\xe2\x80\x94appeared to be travelling in the same direction as\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nTo such of these as spoke to me, I gave myself out as a\r\nHindoo-Boodhist, from a distant province, bound on a pilgrimage. It is\r\nneedless to say that my dress was of the sort to carry out this\r\ndescription. Add, that I know the language as well as I know my own,\r\nand that I am lean enough and brown enough to make it no easy matter to\r\ndetect my European origin\xe2\x80\x94and you will understand that I passed muster\r\nwith the people readily: not as one of themselves, but as a stranger\r\nfrom a distant part of their own country.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, the number of Hindoos travelling in my direction had\r\nincreased to fifties and hundreds. On the third day, the throng had\r\nswollen to thousands; all slowly converging to one point\xe2\x80\x94the city of\r\nSomnauth.\r\n\r\nA trifling service which I was able to render to one of my\r\nfellow-pilgrims, during the third day\xe2\x80\x99s journey, proved the means of\r\nintroducing me to certain Hindoos of the higher caste. From these men I\r\nlearnt that the multitude was on its way to a great religious ceremony,\r\nwhich was to take place on a hill at a little distance from Somnauth.\r\nThe ceremony was in honour of the god of the Moon; and it was to be\r\nheld at night.\r\n\r\nThe crowd detained us as we drew near to the place of celebration. By\r\nthe time we reached the hill the moon was high in the heaven. My Hindoo\r\nfriends possessed some special privileges which enabled them to gain\r\naccess to the shrine. They kindly allowed me to accompany them. When we\r\narrived at the place, we found the shrine hidden from our view by a\r\ncurtain hung between two magnificent trees. Beneath the trees a flat\r\nprojection of rock jutted out, and formed a species of natural\r\nplatform. Below this, I stood, in company with my Hindoo friends.\r\n\r\nLooking back down the hill, the view presented the grandest spectacle\r\nof Nature and Man, in combination, that I have ever seen. The lower\r\nslopes of the eminence melted imperceptibly into a grassy plain, the\r\nplace of the meeting of three rivers. On one side, the graceful winding\r\nof the waters stretched away, now visible, now hidden by trees, as far\r\nas the eye could see. On the other, the waveless ocean slept in the\r\ncalm of the night. People this lovely scene with tens of thousands of\r\nhuman creatures, all dressed in white, stretching down the sides of the\r\nhill, overflowing into the plain, and fringing the nearer banks of the\r\nwinding rivers. Light this halt of the pilgrims by the wild red flames\r\nof cressets and torches, streaming up at intervals from every part of\r\nthe innumerable throng. Imagine the moonlight of the East, pouring in\r\nunclouded glory over all\xe2\x80\x94and you will form some idea of the view that\r\nmet me when I looked forth from the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\nA strain of plaintive music, played on stringed instruments and flutes,\r\nrecalled my attention to the hidden shrine.\r\n\r\nI turned, and saw on the rocky platform the figures of three men. In\r\nthe central figure of the three I recognised the man to whom I had\r\nspoken in England, when the Indians appeared on the terrace at Lady\r\nVerinder\xe2\x80\x99s house. The other two who had been his companions on that\r\noccasion were no doubt his companions also on this.\r\n\r\nOne of the spectators, near whom I was standing, saw me start. In a\r\nwhisper, he explained to me the apparition of the three figures on the\r\nplatform of rock.\r\n\r\nThey were Brahmins (he said) who had forfeited their caste in the\r\nservice of the god. The god had commanded that their purification\r\nshould be the purification by pilgrimage. On that night, the three men\r\nwere to part. In three separate directions, they were to set forth as\r\npilgrims to the shrines of India. Never more were they to look on each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s faces. Never more were they to rest on their wanderings, from\r\nthe day which witnessed their separation, to the day which witnessed\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\nAs those words were whispered to me, the plaintive music ceased. The\r\nthree men prostrated themselves on the rock, before the curtain which\r\nhid the shrine. They rose\xe2\x80\x94they looked on one another\xe2\x80\x94they embraced.\r\nThen they descended separately among the people. The people made way\r\nfor them in dead silence. In three different directions I saw the crowd\r\npart, at one and the same moment. Slowly the grand white mass of the\r\npeople closed together again. The track of the doomed men through the\r\nranks of their fellow mortals was obliterated. We saw them no more.\r\n\r\nA new strain of music, loud and jubilant, rose from the hidden shrine.\r\nThe crowd around me shuddered, and pressed together.\r\n\r\nThe curtain between the trees was drawn aside, and the shrine was\r\ndisclosed to view.\r\n\r\nThere, raised high on a throne\xe2\x80\x94seated on his typical antelope, with his\r\nfour arms stretching towards the four corners of the earth\xe2\x80\x94there,\r\nsoared above us, dark and awful in the mystic light of heaven, the god\r\nof the Moon. And there, in the forehead of the deity, gleamed the\r\nyellow Diamond, whose splendour had last shone on me in England, from\r\nthe bosom of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress!\r\n\r\nYes! after the lapse of eight centuries, the Moonstone looks forth once\r\nmore, over the walls of the sacred city in which its story first began.\r\nHow it has found its way back to its wild native land\xe2\x80\x94by what accident,\r\nor by what crime, the Indians regained possession of their sacred gem,\r\nmay be in your knowledge, but is not in mine. You have lost sight of it\r\nin England, and (if I know anything of this people) you have lost sight\r\nof it for ever.\r\n\r\nSo the years pass, and repeat each other; so the same events revolve in\r\nthe cycles of time. What will be the next adventures of the Moonstone?\r\nWho can tell?\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MOONSTONE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
