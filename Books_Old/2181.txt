It was that room (the first,\r\nafter ascending the staircase) in the centre of which reclines the noble\r\nand most pathetic figure of the Dying Gladiator, just sinking into his\r\ndeath-swoon. Around the walls stand the Antinous, the Amazon, the Lycian\r\nApollo, the Juno; all famous productions of antique sculpture, and still\r\nshining in the undiminished majesty and beauty of their ideal life,\r\nalthough the marble that embodies them is yellow with time, and perhaps\r\ncorroded by the damp earth in which they lay buried for centuries. Here,\r\nlikewise, is seen a symbol (as apt at this moment as it was two thousand\r\nyears ago) of the Human Soul, with its choice of Innocence or Evil close\r\nat hand, in the pretty figure of a child, clasping a dove to her bosom,\r\nbut assaulted by a snake.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the windows of this saloon, we may see a flight of broad\r\nstone steps, descending alongside the antique and massive foundation of\r\nthe Capitol, towards the battered triumphal arch of Septimius Severus,\r\nright below. Farther on, the eye skirts along the edge of the desolate\r\nForum (where Roman washerwomen hang out their linen to the sun), passing\r\nover a shapeless confusion of modern edifices, piled rudely up with\r\nancient brick and stone, and over the domes of Christian churches,\r\nbuilt on the old pavements of heathen temples, and supported by the very\r\npillars that once upheld them. At a distance beyond--yet but a little\r\nway, considering how much history is heaped into the intervening\r\nspace--rises the great sweep of the Coliseum, with the blue sky\r\nbrightening through its upper tier of arches. Far off, the view is shut\r\nin by the Alban Mountains, looking just the same, amid all this decay\r\nand change, as when Romulus gazed thitherward over his half finished\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nWe glance hastily at these things,--at this bright sky, and those\r\nblue distant mountains, and at the ruins, Etruscan, Roman, Christian,\r\nvenerable with a threefold antiquity, and at the company of world-famous\r\nstatues in the saloon,--in the hope of putting the reader into that\r\nstate of feeling which is experienced oftenest at Rome. It is a vague\r\nsense of ponderous remembrances; a perception of such weight and density\r\nin a bygone life, of which this spot was the centre, that the present\r\nmoment is pressed down or crowded out, and our individual affairs and\r\ninterests are but half as real here as elsewhere. Viewed through this\r\nmedium, our narrative--into which are woven some airy and unsubstantial\r\nthreads, intermixed with others, twisted out of the commonest stuff of\r\nhuman existence--may seem not widely different from the texture of all\r\nour lives.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the massiveness of the Roman Past, all matters that we\r\nhandle or dream of nowadays look evanescent and visionary alike.\r\n\r\nIt might be that the four persons whom we are seeking to introduce were\r\nconscious of this dreamy character of the present, as compared with the\r\nsquare blocks of granite wherewith the Romans built their lives. Perhaps\r\nit even contributed to the fanciful merriment which was just now their\r\nmood. When we find ourselves fading into shadows and unrealities, it\r\nseems hardly worth while to be sad, but rather to laugh as gayly as we\r\nmay, and ask little reason wherefore.\r\n\r\nOf these four friends of ours, three were artists, or connected with\r\nart; and, at this moment, they had been simultaneously struck by a\r\nresemblance between one of the antique statues, a well-known masterpiece\r\nof Grecian sculpture, and a young Italian, the fourth member of their\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must needs confess, Kenyon,\xe2\x80\x9d said a dark-eyed young woman, whom\r\nher friends called Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you never chiselled out of marble, nor\r\nwrought in clay, a more vivid likeness than this, cunning a bust-maker\r\nas you think yourself. The portraiture is perfect in character,\r\nsentiment, and feature. If it were a picture, the resemblance might be\r\nhalf illusive and imaginary; but here, in this Pentelic marble, it is a\r\nsubstantial fact, and may be tested by absolute touch and measurement.\r\nOur friend Donatello is the very Faun of Praxiteles. Is it not true,\r\nHilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite--almost--yes, I really think so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda, a slender,\r\nbrown-haired, New England girl, whose perceptions of form and expression\r\nwere wonderfully clear and delicate. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is any difference between\r\nthe two faces, the reason may be, I suppose, that the Faun dwelt in\r\nwoods and fields, and consorted with his like; whereas Donatello has\r\nknown cities a little, and such people as ourselves. But the resemblance\r\nis very close, and very strange.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so strange,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miriam mischievously; \xe2\x80\x9cfor no Faun in\r\nArcadia was ever a greater simpleton than Donatello. He has hardly a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s share of wit, small as that may be. It is a pity there are no\r\nlonger any of this congenial race of rustic creatures for our friend to\r\nconsort with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, naughty one!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very ungrateful, for you\r\nwell know he has wit enough to worship you, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the greater fool he!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam so bitterly that Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s quiet\r\neyes were somewhat startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, in Italian, \xe2\x80\x9cpray gratify us\r\nall by taking the exact attitude of this statue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man laughed, and threw himself into the position in which\r\nthe statue has been standing for two or three thousand years. In truth,\r\nallowing for the difference of costume, and if a lion\xe2\x80\x99s skin could have\r\nbeen substituted for his modern talma, and a rustic pipe for his stick,\r\nDonatello might have figured perfectly as the marble Faun, miraculously\r\nsoftened into flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; the resemblance is wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Kenyon, after examining\r\nthe marble and the man with the accuracy of a sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s eye. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis one point, however, or, rather, two points, in respect to which our\r\nfriend Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s abundant curls will not permit us to say whether the\r\nlikeness is carried into minute detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the sculptor directed the attention of the party to the ears of the\r\nbeautiful statue which they were contemplating.\r\n\r\nBut we must do more than merely refer to this exquisite work of art; it\r\nmust be described, however inadequate may be the effort to express its\r\nmagic peculiarity in words.\r\n\r\nThe Faun is the marble image of a young man, leaning his right arm on\r\nthe trunk or stump of a tree; one hand hangs carelessly by his side;\r\nin the other he holds the fragment of a pipe, or some such sylvan\r\ninstrument of music. His only garment--a lion\xe2\x80\x99s skin, with the claws\r\nupon his shoulder--falls halfway down his back, leaving the limbs\r\nand entire front of the figure nude. The form, thus displayed, is\r\nmarvellously graceful, but has a fuller and more rounded outline, more\r\nflesh, and less of heroic muscle, than the old sculptors were wont to\r\nassign to their types of masculine beauty. The character of the face\r\ncorresponds with the figure; it is most agreeable in outline and\r\nfeature, but rounded and somewhat voluptuously developed, especially\r\nabout the throat and chin; the nose is almost straight, but very\r\nslightly curves inward, thereby acquiring an indescribable charm of\r\ngeniality and humor. The mouth, with its full yet delicate lips, seems\r\nso nearly to smile outright, that it calls forth a responsive smile. The\r\nwhole statue--unlike anything else that ever was wrought in that severe\r\nmaterial of marble--conveys the idea of an amiable and sensual creature,\r\neasy, mirthful, apt for jollity, yet not incapable of being touched\r\nby pathos. It is impossible to gaze long at this stone image without\r\nconceiving a kindly sentiment towards it, as if its substance were warm\r\nto the touch, and imbued with actual life. It comes very close to some\r\nof our pleasantest sympathies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is the very lack of moral severity, of any high and heroic\r\ningredient in the character of the Faun, that makes it so delightful an\r\nobject to the human eye and to the frailty of the human heart. The being\r\nhere represented is endowed with no principle of virtue, and would be\r\nincapable of comprehending such; but he would be true and honest by dint\r\nof his simplicity. We should expect from him no sacrifice or effort for\r\nan abstract cause; there is not an atom of martyr\xe2\x80\x99s stuff in all that\r\nsoftened marble; but he has a capacity for strong and warm attachment,\r\nand might act devotedly through its impulse, and even die for it at\r\nneed. It is possible, too, that the Faun might be educated through the\r\nmedium of his emotions, so that the coarser animal portion of his nature\r\nmight eventually be thrown into the background, though never utterly\r\nexpelled.\r\n\r\nThe animal nature, indeed, is a most essential part of the Faun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposition; for the characteristics of the brute creation meet and\r\ncombine with those of humanity in this strange yet true and natural\r\nconception of antique poetry and art. Praxiteles has subtly diffused\r\nthroughout his work that mute mystery, which so hopelessly perplexes us\r\nwhenever we attempt to gain an intellectual or sympathetic knowledge of\r\nthe lower orders of creation. The riddle is indicated, however, only by\r\ntwo definite signs: these are the two ears of the Faun, which are leaf\r\nshaped, terminating in little peaks, like those of some species of\r\nanimals. Though not so seen in the marble, they are probably to be\r\nconsidered as clothed in fine, downy fur. In the coarser representations\r\nof this class of mythological creatures, there is another token of brute\r\nkindred,--a certain caudal appendage; which, if the Faun of Praxiteles\r\nmust be supposed to possess it at all, is hidden by the lion\xe2\x80\x99s skin that\r\nforms his garment. The pointed and furry ears, therefore, are the sole\r\nindications of his wild, forest nature.\r\n\r\nOnly a sculptor of the finest imagination, the most delicate taste, the\r\nsweetest feeling, and the rarest artistic skill--in a word, a sculptor\r\nand a poet too--could have first dreamed of a Faun in this guise, and\r\nthen have succeeded in imprisoning the sportive and frisky thing in\r\nmarble. Neither man nor animal, and yet no monster, but a being in whom\r\nboth races meet on friendly ground. The idea grows coarse as we handle\r\nit, and hardens in our grasp. But, if the spectator broods long over\r\nthe statue, he will be conscious of its spell; all the pleasantness of\r\nsylvan life, all the genial and happy characteristics of creatures that\r\ndwell in woods and fields, will seem to be mingled and kneaded into one\r\nsubstance, along with the kindred qualities in the human soul. Trees,\r\ngrass, flowers, woodland streamlets, cattle, deer, and unsophisticated\r\nman. The essence of all these was compressed long ago, and still exists,\r\nwithin that discolored marble surface of the Faun of Praxiteles.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, the idea may have been no dream, but rather a poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreminiscence of a period when man\xe2\x80\x99s affinity with nature was more\r\nstrict, and his fellowship with every living thing more intimate and\r\ndear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAUN\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello,\xe2\x80\x9d playfully cried Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not leave us in this perplexity!\r\nShake aside those brown curls, my friend, and let us see whether this\r\nmarvellous resemblance extends to the very tips of the ears. If so, we\r\nshall like you all the better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, dearest signorina,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Donatello, laughing, but with\r\na certain earnestness. \xe2\x80\x9cI entreat you to take the tips of my ears for\r\ngranted.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke, the young Italian made a skip and jump, light\r\nenough for a veritable faun; so as to place himself quite beyond the\r\nreach of the fair hand that was outstretched, as if to settle the matter\r\nby actual examination. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be like a wolf of the Apennines,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, taking his stand on the other side of the Dying Gladiator,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you touch my ears ever so softly. None of my race could endure it.\r\nIt has always been a tender point with my forefathers and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke in Italian, with the Tuscan rusticity of accent, and an\r\nunshaped sort of utterance, betokening that he must heretofore have been\r\nchiefly conversant with rural people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cyour tender point--your two tender points,\r\nif you have them--shall be safe, so far as I am concerned. But how\r\nstrange this likeness is, after all! and how delightful, if it really\r\nincludes the pointed ears! O, it is impossible, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncontinued, in English, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a real and commonplace young man like\r\nDonatello; but you see how this peculiarity defines the position of\r\nthe Faun; and, while putting him where he cannot exactly assert his\r\nbrotherhood, still disposes us kindly towards the kindred creature. He\r\nis not supernatural, but just on the verge of nature, and yet within\r\nit. What is the nameless charm of this idea, Hilda? You can feel it more\r\ndelicately than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt perplexes me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda thoughtfully, and shrinking a little;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cneither do I quite like to think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cyou agree with Miriam and me that there is\r\nsomething very touching and impressive in this statue of the Faun. In\r\nsome long-past age, he must really have existed. Nature needed, and\r\nstill needs, this beautiful creature; standing betwixt man and animal,\r\nsympathizing with each, comprehending the speech of either race, and\r\ninterpreting the whole existence of one to the other. What a pity that\r\nhe has forever vanished from the hard and dusty paths of life,--unless,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n added the sculptor, in a sportive whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cDonatello be actually he!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot conceive how this fantasy takes hold of me,\xe2\x80\x9d responded\r\nMiriam, between jest and earnest. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine, now, a real being, similar\r\nto this mythic Faun; how happy, how genial, how satisfactory would be\r\nhis life, enjoying the warm, sensuous, earthy side of nature; revelling\r\nin the merriment of woods and streams; living as our four-footed kindred\r\ndo,--as mankind did in its innocent childhood; before sin, sorrow or\r\nmorality itself had ever been thought of! Ah! Kenyon, if Hilda and you\r\nand I--if I, at least--had pointed ears! For I suppose the Faun had\r\nno conscience, no remorse, no burden on the heart, no troublesome\r\nrecollections of any sort; no dark future either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a tragic tone was that last, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor;\r\nand, looking into her face, he was startled to behold it pale and\r\ntear-stained. \xe2\x80\x9cHow suddenly this mood has come over you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it go as it came,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9clike a thunder-shower in this\r\nRoman sky. All is sunshine again, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello\xe2\x80\x99s refractoriness as regarded his ears had evidently cost him\r\nsomething, and he now came close to Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s side, gazing at her with an\r\nappealing air, as if to solicit forgiveness. His mute, helpless gesture\r\nof entreaty had something pathetic in it, and yet might well enough\r\nexcite a laugh, so like it was to what you may see in the aspect of a\r\nhound when he thinks himself in fault or disgrace. It was difficult to\r\nmake out the character of this young man. So full of animal life as\r\nhe was, so joyous in his deportment, so handsome, so physically\r\nwell-developed, he made no impression of incompleteness, of maimed or\r\nstinted nature. And yet, in social intercourse, these familiar friends\r\nof his habitually and instinctively allowed for him, as for a child or\r\nsome other lawless thing, exacting no strict obedience to conventional\r\nrules, and hardly noticing his eccentricities enough to pardon them.\r\nThere was an indefinable characteristic about Donatello that set him\r\noutside of rules.\r\n\r\nHe caught Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s hand, kissed it, and gazed into her eyes without\r\nsaying a word. She smiled, and bestowed on him a little careless caress,\r\nsingularly like what one would give to a pet dog when he puts himself in\r\nthe way to receive it. Not that it was so decided a caress either, but\r\nonly the merest touch, somewhere between a pat and a tap of the finger;\r\nit might be a mark of fondness, or perhaps a playful pretence of\r\npunishment. At all events, it appeared to afford Donatello exquisite\r\npleasure; insomuch that he danced quite round the wooden railing that\r\nfences in the Dying Gladiator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the very step of the Dancing Faun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, apart, to Hilda.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a child, or what a simpleton, he is! I continually find myself\r\ntreating Donatello as if he were the merest unfledged chicken; and yet\r\nhe can claim no such privileges in the right of his tender age, for he\r\nis at least--how old should you think him, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty years, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda, glancing at Donatello; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\nindeed, I cannot tell; hardly so old, on second thoughts, or possibly\r\nolder. He has nothing to do with time, but has a look of eternal youth\r\nin his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll underwitted people have that look,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello has certainly the gift of eternal youth, as Hilda suggests,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n observed Kenyon, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, judging by the date of this statue,\r\nwhich, I am more and more convinced, Praxiteles carved on purpose for\r\nhim, he must be at least twenty-five centuries old, and he still looks\r\nas young as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat age have you, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignorina, I do not know,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cno great age, however; for I\r\nhave only lived since I met you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what old man of society could have turned a silly compliment more\r\nsmartly than that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cNature and art are just at one\r\nsometimes. But what a happy ignorance is this of our friend Donatello!\r\nNot to know his own age! It is equivalent to being immortal on earth. If\r\nI could only forget mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too soon to wish that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the sculptor; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are scarcely\r\nolder than Donatello looks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be content, then,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cif I could only forget\r\none day of all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she seemed to repent of this allusion, and\r\nhastily added, \xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s days are so tedious that it is a boon to leave\r\neven one of them out of the account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foregoing conversation had been carried on in a mood in which all\r\nimaginative people, whether artists or poets, love to indulge. In this\r\nframe of mind, they sometimes find their profoundest truths side by side\r\nwith the idlest jest, and utter one or the other, apparently without\r\ndistinguishing which is the most valuable, or assigning any considerable\r\nvalue to either. The resemblance between the marble Faun and their\r\nliving companion had made a deep, half-serious, half-mirthful impression\r\non these three friends, and had taken them into a certain airy region,\r\nlifting up, as it is so pleasant to feel them lifted, their heavy\r\nearthly feet from the actual soil of life. The world had been set\r\nafloat, as it were, for a moment, and relieved them, for just so long,\r\nof all customary responsibility for what they thought and said.\r\n\r\nIt might be under this influence--or, perhaps, because sculptors always\r\nabuse one another\xe2\x80\x99s works--that Kenyon threw in a criticism upon the\r\nDying Gladiator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to admire this statue exceedingly,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, latterly,\r\nI find myself getting weary and annoyed that the man should be such a\r\nlength of time leaning on his arm in the very act of death. If he is so\r\nterribly hurt, why does he not sink down and die without further ado?\r\nFlitting moments, imminent emergencies, imperceptible intervals between\r\ntwo breaths, ought not to be incrusted with the eternal repose of\r\nmarble; in any sculptural subject, there should be a moral standstill,\r\nsince there must of necessity be a physical one. Otherwise, it is\r\nlike flinging a block of marble up into the air, and, by some trick of\r\nenchantment, causing it to stick there. You feel that it ought to come\r\ndown, and are dissatisfied that it does not obey the natural law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam mischievously, \xe2\x80\x9cyou think that sculpture should\r\nbe a sort of fossilizing process. But, in truth, your frozen art has\r\nnothing like the scope and freedom of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s and mine. In painting\r\nthere is no similar objection to the representation of brief snatches\r\nof time,--perhaps because a story can be so much more fully told in\r\npicture, and buttressed about with circumstances that give it an epoch.\r\nFor instance, a painter never would have sent down yonder Faun out of\r\nhis far antiquity, lonely and desolate, with no companion to keep his\r\nsimple heart warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the Faun!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hilda, with a little gesture of impatience; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave been looking at him too long; and now, instead of a beautiful\r\nstatue, immortally young, I see only a corroded and discolored stone.\r\nThis change is very apt to occur in statues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a similar one in pictures, surely,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nthe spectator\xe2\x80\x99s mood that transfigures the Transfiguration itself.\r\nI defy any painter to move and elevate me without my own consent and\r\nassistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are deficient of a sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam.\r\n\r\nThe party now strayed onward from hall to hall of that rich gallery,\r\npausing here and there, to look at the multitude of noble and lovely\r\nshapes, which have been dug up out of the deep grave in which old Rome\r\nlies buried. And still, the realization of the antique Faun, in the\r\nperson of Donatello, gave a more vivid character to all these marble\r\nghosts. Why should not each statue grow warm with life! Antinous might\r\nlift his brow, and tell us why he is forever sad. The Lycian Apollo\r\nmight strike his lyre; and, at the first vibration, that other Faun in\r\nred marble, who keeps up a motionless dance, should frisk gayly forth,\r\nleading yonder Satyrs, with shaggy goat-shanks, to clatter their little\r\nhoofs upon the floor, and all join hands with Donatello! Bacchus, too,\r\na rosy flush diffusing itself over his time-stained surface, could\r\ncome down from his pedestal, and offer a cluster of purple grapes to\r\nDonatello\xe2\x80\x99s lips; because the god recognizes him as the woodland elf\r\nwho so often shared his revels. And here, in this sarcophagus, the\r\nexquisitely carved figures might assume life, and chase one another\r\nround its verge with that wild merriment which is so strangely\r\nrepresented on those old burial coffers: though still with some subtile\r\nallusion to death, carefully veiled, but forever peeping forth amid\r\nemblems of mirth and riot.\r\n\r\nAs the four friends descended the stairs, however, their play of fancy\r\nsubsided into a much more sombre mood; a result apt to follow upon such\r\nexhilaration as that which had so recently taken possession of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam confidentially to Hilda, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt the reality\r\nof this likeness of Donatello to the Faun, which we have been talking so\r\nmuch about? To say the truth, it never struck me so forcibly as it did\r\nKenyon and yourself, though I gave in to whatever you were pleased to\r\nfancy, for the sake of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s mirth and wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI was certainly\r\nin earnest, and you seemed equally so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda, glancing back\r\nat Donatello, as if to reassure herself of the resemblance. \xe2\x80\x9cBut faces\r\nchange so much, from hour to hour, that the same set of features has\r\noften no keeping with itself; to an eye, at least, which looks at\r\nexpression more than outline. How sad and sombre he has grown all of a\r\nsudden!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAngry too, methinks! nay, it is anger much more than sadness,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen Donatello in this mood once or twice before.\r\nIf you consider him well, you will observe an odd mixture of\r\nthe bulldog, or some other equally fierce brute, in our friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposition; a trait of savageness hardly to be expected in such a\r\ngentle creature as he usually is. Donatello is a very strange young man.\r\nI wish he would not haunt my footsteps so continually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have bewitched the poor lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave a faculty of bewitching people, and it is providing you with a\r\nsingular train of followers. I see another of them behind yonder pillar;\r\nand it is his presence that has aroused Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s wrath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had now emerged from the gateway of the palace; and partly\r\nconcealed by one of the pillars of the portico stood a figure such as\r\nmay often be encountered in the streets and piazzas of Rome, and nowhere\r\nelse. He looked as if he might just have stepped out of a picture, and,\r\nin truth, was likely enough to find his way into a dozen pictures; being\r\nno other than one of those living models, dark, bushy bearded, wild\r\nof aspect and attire, whom artists convert into saints or assassins,\r\naccording as their pictorial purposes demand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiriam,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Hilda, a little startled, \xe2\x80\x9cit is your model!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBTERRANEAN REMINISCENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam\xe2\x80\x99s model has so important a connection with our story, that it is\r\nessential to describe the singular mode of his first appearance, and\r\nhow he subsequently became a self-appointed follower of the young female\r\nartist. In the first place, however, we must devote a page or two to\r\ncertain peculiarities in the position of Miriam herself.\r\n\r\nThere was an ambiguity about this young lady, which, though it did not\r\nnecessarily imply anything wrong, would have operated unfavorably as\r\nregarded her reception in society, anywhere but in Rome. The truth was,\r\nthat nobody knew anything about Miriam, either for good or evil. She had\r\nmade her appearance without introduction, had taken a studio, put her\r\ncard upon the door, and showed very considerable talent as a painter in\r\noils. Her fellow professors of the brush, it is true, showered abundant\r\ncriticisms upon her pictures, allowing them to be well enough for the\r\nidle half-efforts of an amateur, but lacking both the trained skill and\r\nthe practice that distinguish the works of a true artist.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, be their faults what they might, Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s pictures met\r\nwith good acceptance among the patrons of modern art. Whatever technical\r\nmerit they lacked, its absence was more than supplied by a warmth\r\nand passionateness, which she had the faculty of putting into her\r\nproductions, and which all the world could feel. Her nature had a great\r\ndeal of color, and, in accordance with it, so likewise had her pictures.\r\n\r\nMiriam had great apparent freedom of intercourse; her manners were so\r\nfar from evincing shyness, that it seemed easy to become acquainted with\r\nher, and not difficult to develop a casual acquaintance into intimacy.\r\nSuch, at least, was the impression which she made, upon brief contact,\r\nbut not such the ultimate conclusion of those who really sought to know\r\nher. So airy, free, and affable was Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s deportment towards all who\r\ncame within her sphere, that possibly they might never be conscious of\r\nthe fact, but so it was, that they did not get on, and were seldom any\r\nfurther advanced into her good graces to-day than yesterday. By some\r\nsubtile quality, she kept people at a distance, without so much as\r\nletting them know that they were excluded from her inner circle. She\r\nresembled one of those images of light, which conjurers evoke and cause\r\nto shine before us, in apparent tangibility, only an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length beyond\r\nour grasp: we make a step in advance, expecting to seize the illusion,\r\nbut find it still precisely so far out of our reach. Finally, society\r\nbegan to recognize the impossibility of getting nearer to Miriam, and\r\ngruffly acquiesced.\r\n\r\nThere were two persons, however, whom she appeared to acknowledge as\r\nfriends in the closer and truer sense of the word; and both of these\r\nmore favored individuals did credit to Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s selection. One was\r\na young American sculptor, of high promise and rapidly increasing\r\ncelebrity; the other, a girl of the same country, a painter like Miriam\r\nherself, but in a widely different sphere of art. Her heart flowed out\r\ntowards these two; she requited herself by their society and friendship\r\n(and especially by Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s) for all the loneliness with which, as\r\nregarded the rest of the world, she chose to be surrounded. Her two\r\nfriends were conscious of the strong, yearning grasp which Miriam laid\r\nupon them, and gave her their affection in full measure; Hilda, indeed,\r\nresponding with the fervency of a girl\xe2\x80\x99s first friendship, and Kenyon\r\nwith a manly regard, in which there was nothing akin to what is\r\ndistinctively called love.\r\n\r\nA sort of intimacy subsequently grew up between these three friends\r\nand a fourth individual; it was a young Italian, who, casually visiting\r\nRome, had been attracted by the beauty which Miriam possessed in a\r\nremarkable degree. He had sought her, followed her, and insisted, with\r\nsimple perseverance, upon being admitted at least to her acquaintance; a\r\nboon which had been granted, when a more artful character, seeking it by\r\na more subtle mode of pursuit, would probably have failed to obtain it.\r\nThis young man, though anything but intellectually brilliant, had many\r\nagreeable characteristics which won him the kindly and half-contemptuous\r\nregard of Miriam and her two friends. It was he whom they called\r\nDonatello, and whose wonderful resemblance to the Faun of Praxiteles\r\nforms the keynote of our narrative.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position in which we find Miriam some few months after her\r\nestablishment at Rome. It must be added, however, that the world did not\r\npermit her to hide her antecedents without making her the subject of\r\na good deal of conjecture; as was natural enough, considering the\r\nabundance of her personal charms, and the degree of notice that she\r\nattracted as an artist. There were many stories about Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s origin\r\nand previous life, some of which had a very probable air, while others\r\nwere evidently wild and romantic fables. We cite a few, leaving the\r\nreader to designate them either under the probable or the romantic head.\r\n\r\nIt was said, for example, that Miriam was the daughter and heiress of\r\na great Jewish banker (an idea perhaps suggested by a certain rich\r\nOriental character in her face), and had fled from her paternal home\r\nto escape a union with a cousin, the heir of another of that golden\r\nbrotherhood; the object being to retain their vast accumulation of\r\nwealth within the family. Another story hinted that she was a German\r\nprincess, whom, for reasons of state, it was proposed to give in\r\nmarriage either to a decrepit sovereign, or a prince still in his\r\ncradle. According to a third statement, she was the off-spring of a\r\nSouthern American planter, who had given her an elaborate education and\r\nendowed her with his wealth; but the one burning drop of African\r\nblood in her veins so affected her with a sense of ignominy, that she\r\nrelinquished all and fled her country. By still another account she was\r\nthe lady of an English nobleman; and, out of mere love and honor of\r\nart, had thrown aside the splendor of her rank, and come to seek a\r\nsubsistence by her pencil in a Roman studio.\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases, the fable seemed to be instigated by the large\r\nand bounteous impression which Miriam invariably made, as if necessity\r\nand she could have nothing to do with one another. Whatever deprivations\r\nshe underwent must needs be voluntary. But there were other surmises,\r\ntaking such a commonplace view as that Miriam was the daughter of a\r\nmerchant or financier, who had been ruined in a great commercial crisis;\r\nand, possessing a taste for art, she had attempted to support herself by\r\nthe pencil, in preference to the alternative of going out as governess.\r\n\r\nBe these things how they might, Miriam, fair as she looked, was plucked\r\nup out of a mystery, and had its roots still clinging to her. She was a\r\nbeautiful and attractive woman, but based, as it were, upon a cloud, and\r\nall surrounded with misty substance; so that the result was to render\r\nher sprite-like in her most ordinary manifestations. This was the case\r\neven in respect to Kenyon and Hilda, her especial friends. But such was\r\nthe effect of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s natural language, her generosity, kindliness, and\r\nnative truth of character, that these two received her as a dear friend\r\ninto their hearts, taking her good qualities as evident and genuine, and\r\nnever imagining that what was hidden must be therefore evil.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed with our narrative.\r\n\r\nThe same party of friends, whom we have seen at the sculpture-gallery of\r\nthe Capitol, chanced to have gone together, some months before, to the\r\ncatacomb of St. Calixtus. They went joyously down into that vast\r\ntomb, and wandered by torchlight through a sort of dream, in which\r\nreminiscences of church aisles and grimy cellars--and chiefly the\r\nlatter--seemed to be broken into fragments, and hopelessly intermingled.\r\nThe intricate passages along which they followed their guide had been\r\nhewn, in some forgotten age, out of a dark-red, crumbly stone. On either\r\nside were horizontal niches, where, if they held their torches closely,\r\nthe shape of a human body was discernible in white ashes, into which the\r\nentire mortality of a man or woman had resolved itself. Among all this\r\nextinct dust, there might perchance be a thigh-bone, which crumbled at\r\na touch; or possibly a skull, grinning at its own wretched plight, as is\r\nthe ugly and empty habit of the thing.\r\n\r\nSometimes their gloomy pathway tended upward, so that, through a\r\ncrevice, a little daylight glimmered down upon them, or even a streak of\r\nsunshine peeped into a burial niche; then again, they went downward by\r\ngradual descent, or by abrupt, rudely hewn steps, into deeper and deeper\r\nrecesses of the earth. Here and there the narrow and tortuous passages\r\nwidened somewhat, developing themselves into small chapels;--which\r\nonce, no doubt, had been adorned with marble-work and lighted with\r\never-burning lamps and tapers. All such illumination and ornament,\r\nhowever, had long since been extinguished and stript away; except,\r\nindeed, that the low roofs of a few of these ancient sites of worship\r\nwere covered with dingy stucco, and frescoed with scriptural scenes and\r\nsubjects, in the dreariest stage of ruin.\r\n\r\nIn one such chapel, the guide showed them a low arch, beneath which the\r\nbody of St. Cecilia had been buried after her martyrdom, and where it\r\nlay till a sculptor saw it, and rendered it forever beautiful in marble.\r\n\r\nIn a similar spot they found two sarcophagi, one containing a skeleton,\r\nand the other a shrivelled body, which still wore the garments of its\r\nformer lifetime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dismal all this is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, shuddering. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know why we\r\ncame here, nor why we should stay a moment longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate it all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello with peculiar energy. \xe2\x80\x9cDear friends,\r\nlet us hasten back into the blessed daylight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the first, Donatello had shown little fancy for the expedition;\r\nfor, like most Italians, and in especial accordance with the law of his\r\nown simple and physically happy nature, this young man had an infinite\r\nrepugnance to graves and skulls, and to all that ghastliness which the\r\nGothic mind loves to associate with the idea of death. He shuddered,\r\nand looked fearfully round, drawing nearer to Miriam, whose attractive\r\ninfluence alone had enticed him into that gloomy region.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a child you are, poor Donatello!\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, with the freedom\r\nwhich she always used towards him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are afraid of ghosts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, signorina; terribly afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d said the truthful Donatello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also believe in ghosts,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cand could tremble at them,\r\nin a suitable place. But these sepulchres are so old, and these skulls\r\nand white ashes so very dry, that methinks they have ceased to be\r\nhaunted. The most awful idea connected with the catacombs is their\r\ninterminable extent, and the possibility of going astray into this\r\nlabyrinth of darkness, which broods around the little glimmer of our\r\ntapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas any one ever been lost here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kenyon of the guide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, signor; one, no longer ago than my father\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nguide; and he added, with the air of a man who believed what he was\r\ntelling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the first that went astray here was a pagan of old Rome,\r\nwho hid himself in order to spy out and betray the blessed saints, who\r\nthen dwelt and worshipped in these dismal places. You have heard the\r\nstory, signor? A miracle was wrought upon the accursed one; and, ever\r\nsince (for fifteen centuries at least), he has been groping in the\r\ndarkness, seeking his way out of the catacomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he ever been seen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hilda, who had great and tremulous faith\r\nin marvels of this kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese eyes of mine never beheld him, signorina; the saints forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered the guide. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is well known that he watches near parties\r\nthat come into the catacomb, especially if they be heretics, hoping to\r\nlead some straggler astray. What this lost wretch pines for, almost as\r\nmuch as for the blessed sunshine, is a companion to be miserable with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an intense desire for sympathy indicates something amiable in the\r\npoor fellow, at all events,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Kenyon.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached a larger chapel than those heretofore seen; it\r\nwas of a circular shape, and, though hewn out of the solid mass of red\r\nsandstone, had pillars, and a carved roof, and other tokens of a regular\r\narchitectural design. Nevertheless, considered as a church, it was\r\nexceedingly minute, being scarcely twice a man\xe2\x80\x99s stature in height, and\r\nonly two or three paces from wall to wall; and while their collected\r\ntorches illuminated this one small, consecrated spot, the great darkness\r\nspread all round it, like that immenser mystery which envelops our\r\nlittle life, and into which friends vanish from us, one by one. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nwhere is Miriam?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Hilda. The party gazed hurriedly from face to\r\nface, and became aware that one of their party had vanished into\r\nthe great darkness, even while they were shuddering at the remote\r\npossibility of such a misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTRE OF THE CATACOMB\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, she cannot be lost!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is but a moment since\r\nshe was speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, in great alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was behind us all; and it is\r\na long while since we have heard her voice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorches! torches!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cI will seek her, be\r\nthe darkness ever so dismal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the guide held him back, and assured them all that there was no\r\npossibility of assisting their lost companion, unless by shouting at\r\nthe very top of their voices. As the sound would go very far along these\r\nclose and narrow passages, there was a fair probability that Miriam\r\nmight hear the call, and be able to retrace her steps.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they all--Kenyon with his bass voice; Donatello with his\r\ntenor; the guide with that high and hard Italian cry, which makes the\r\nstreets of Rome so resonant; and Hilda with her slender scream, piercing\r\nfarther than the united uproar of the rest--began to shriek, halloo, and\r\nbellow, with the utmost force of their lungs. And, not to prolong the\r\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s suspense (for we do not particularly seek to interest him\r\nin this scene, telling it only on account of the trouble and strange\r\nentanglement which followed), they soon heard a responsive call, in a\r\nfemale voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the signorina!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello joyfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it was certainly dear Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here she\r\ncomes! Thank Heaven! Thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe figure of their friend was now discernible by her own torchlight,\r\napproaching out of one of the cavernous passages. Miriam came forward,\r\nbut not with the eagerness and tremulous joy of a fearful girl, just\r\nrescued from a labyrinth of gloomy mystery. She made no immediate\r\nresponse to their inquiries and tumultuous congratulations; and, as they\r\nafterwards remembered, there was something absorbed, thoughtful, and\r\nself-concentrated in her deportment. She looked pale, as well she might,\r\nand held her torch with a nervous grasp, the tremor of which was seen\r\nin the irregular twinkling of the flame. This last was the chief\r\nperceptible sign of any recent agitation or alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest, dearest Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hilda, throwing her arms about her\r\nfriend, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere have you been straying from us? Blessed be Providence,\r\nwhich has rescued you out of that miserable darkness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, dear Hilda!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miriam, with a strange little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\nyou quite sure that it was Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s guidance which brought me back?\r\nIf so, it was by an odd messenger, as you will confess. See; there he\r\nstands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStartled at Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s words and manner, Hilda gazed into the duskiness\r\nwhither she pointed, and there beheld a figure standing just on the\r\ndoubtful limit of obscurity, at the threshold of the small, illuminated\r\nchapel. Kenyon discerned him at the same instant, and drew nearer with\r\nhis torch; although the guide attempted to dissuade him, averring that,\r\nonce beyond the consecrated precincts of the chapel, the apparition\r\nwould have power to tear him limb from limb. It struck the sculptor,\r\nhowever, when he afterwards recurred to these circumstances, that the\r\nguide manifested no such apprehension on his own account as he professed\r\non behalf of others; for he kept pace with Kenyon as the latter\r\napproached the figure, though still endeavoring to restrain \xe2\x80\x98him.\r\n\r\nIn fine, they both drew near enough to get as good a view of the spectre\r\nas the smoky light of their torches, struggling with the massive gloom,\r\ncould supply.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was of exceedingly picturesque, and even melodramatic\r\naspect. He was clad in a voluminous cloak, that seemed to be made of a\r\nbuffalo\xe2\x80\x99s hide, and a pair of those goat-skin breeches, with the hair\r\noutward, which are still commonly worn by the peasants of the Roman\r\nCampagna. In this garb, they look like antique Satyrs; and, in truth,\r\nthe Spectre of the Catacomb might have represented the last survivor\r\nof that vanished race, hiding himself in sepulchral gloom, and mourning\r\nover his lost life of woods and streams.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, he had on a broad-brimmed, conical hat, beneath the shadow\r\nof which a wild visage was indistinctly seen, floating away, as it were,\r\ninto a dusky wilderness of mustache and beard. His eyes winked, and\r\nturned uneasily from the torches, like a creature to whom midnight would\r\nbe more congenial than noonday.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the spectre might have made a considerable impression\r\non the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s nerves, only that he was in the habit of observing\r\nsimilar figures, almost every day, reclining on the Spanish steps,\r\nand waiting for some artist to invite them within the magic realm of\r\npicture. Nor, even thus familiarized with the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities\r\nof appearance, could Kenyon help wondering to see such a personage,\r\nshaping himself so suddenly out of the void darkness of the catacomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor, advancing his torch nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\r\nlong have you been wandering here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand and five hundred years!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the guide, loud enough to\r\nbe heard by all the party. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the old pagan phantom that I told you\r\nof, who sought to betray the blessed saints!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it is a phantom!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello, with a shudder. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, dearest\r\nsignorina, what a fearful thing has beset you in those dark corridors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is no more a phantom\r\nthan yourself. The only marvel is, how he comes to be hiding himself in\r\nthe catacomb. Possibly our guide might solve the riddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe spectre himself here settled the point of his tangibility, at all\r\nevents, and physical substance, by approaching a step nearer, and laying\r\nhis hand on Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquire not what I am, nor wherefore I abide in the darkness,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nin a hoarse, harsh voice, as if a great deal of damp were clustering in\r\nhis throat. \xe2\x80\x9cHenceforth, I am nothing but a shadow behind her footsteps.\r\nShe came to me when I sought her not. She has called me forth, and must\r\nabide the consequences of my reappearance in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Virgin! I wish the signorina joy of her prize,\xe2\x80\x9d said the guide,\r\nhalf to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in any case, the catacomb is well rid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe need follow the scene no further. So much is essential to the\r\nsubsequent narrative, that, during the short period while astray in\r\nthose tortuous passages, Miriam had encountered an unknown man, and\r\nled him forth with her, or was guided back by him, first into the\r\ntorchlight, thence into the sunshine.\r\n\r\nIt was the further singularity of this affair, that the connection, thus\r\nbriefly and casually formed, did not terminate with the incident\r\nthat gave it birth. As if her service to him, or his service to her,\r\nwhichever it might be, had given him an indefeasible claim on Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nregard and protection, the Spectre of the Catacomb never long allowed\r\nher to lose sight of him, from that day forward. He haunted her\r\nfootsteps with more than the customary persistency of Italian\r\nmendicants, when once they have recognized a benefactor. For days\r\ntogether, it is true, he occasionally vanished, but always reappeared,\r\ngliding after her through the narrow streets, or climbing the hundred\r\nsteps of her staircase and sitting at her threshold.\r\n\r\nBeing often admitted to her studio, he left his features, or some shadow\r\nor reminiscence of them, in many of her sketches and pictures. The moral\r\natmosphere of these productions was thereby so influenced, that rival\r\npainters pronounced it a case of hopeless mannerism, which would destroy\r\nall Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of true excellence in art.\r\n\r\nThe story of this adventure spread abroad, and made its way beyond\r\nthe usual gossip of the Forestieri, even into Italian circles, where,\r\nenhanced by a still potent spirit of superstition, it grew far more\r\nwonderful than as above recounted. Thence, it came back among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, and was communicated to the German artists, who so richly\r\nsupplied it with romantic ornaments and excrescences, after their\r\nfashion, that it became a fantasy worthy of Tieck or Hoffmann. For\r\nnobody has any conscience about adding to the improbabilities of a\r\nmarvellous tale.\r\n\r\nThe most reasonable version of the incident, that could anywise be\r\nrendered acceptable to the auditors, was substantially the one suggested\r\nby the guide of the catacomb, in his allusion to the legend of Memmius.\r\nThis man, or demon, or man-demon, was a spy during the persecutions\r\nof the early Christians, probably under the Emperor Diocletian, and\r\npenetrated into the catacomb of St. Calixtus, with the malignant purpose\r\nof tracing out the hiding-places of the refugees. But, while he stole\r\ncraftily through those dark corridors, he chanced to come upon a little\r\nchapel, where tapers were burning before an altar and a crucifix, and\r\na priest was in the performance of his sacred office. By divine\r\nindulgence, there was a single moment\xe2\x80\x99s grace allowed to Memmius, during\r\nwhich, had he been capable of Christian faith and love, he might have\r\nknelt before the cross, and received the holy light into his soul, and\r\nso have been blest forever. But he resisted the sacred impulse. As\r\nsoon, therefore, as that one moment had glided by, the light of the\r\nconsecrated tapers, which represent all truth, bewildered the wretched\r\nman with everlasting error, and the blessed cross itself was stamped\r\nas a seal upon his heart, so that it should never open to receive\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThenceforth, this heathen Memmius has haunted the wide and dreary\r\nprecincts of the catacomb, seeking, as some say, to beguile new victims\r\ninto his own misery; but, according to other statements, endeavoring to\r\nprevail on any unwary visitor to take him by the hand, and guide him out\r\ninto the daylight. Should his wiles and entreaties take effect, however,\r\nthe man-demon would remain only a little while above ground. He would\r\ngratify his fiendish malignity by perpetrating signal mischief on his\r\nbenefactor, and perhaps bringing some old pestilence or other forgotten\r\nand long-buried evil on society; or, possibly, teaching the modern\r\nworld some decayed and dusty kind of crime, which the antique Romans\r\nknew,--and then would hasten back to the catacomb, which, after so long\r\nhaunting it, has grown his most congenial home.\r\n\r\nMiriam herself, with her chosen friends, the sculptor and the gentle\r\nHilda, often laughed at the monstrous fictions that had gone abroad in\r\nreference to her adventure. Her two confidants (for such they were,\r\non all ordinary subjects) had not failed to ask an explanation of the\r\nmystery, since undeniably a mystery there was, and one sufficiently\r\nperplexing in itself, without any help from the imaginative faculty.\r\nAnd, sometimes responding to their inquiries with a melancholy sort of\r\nplayfulness, Miriam let her fancy run off into wilder fables than any\r\nwhich German ingenuity or Italian superstition had contrived.\r\n\r\nFor example, with a strange air of seriousness over all her face, only\r\nbelied by a laughing gleam in her dark eyes, she would aver that the\r\nspectre (who had been an artist in his mortal lifetime) had promised\r\nto teach her a long-lost, but invaluable secret of old Roman fresco\r\npainting. The knowledge of this process would place Miriam at the head\r\nof modern art; the sole condition being agreed upon, that she should\r\nreturn with him into his sightless gloom, after enriching a certain\r\nextent of stuccoed wall with the most brilliant and lovely designs. And\r\nwhat true votary of art would not purchase unrivalled excellence, even\r\nat so vast a sacrifice!\r\n\r\nOr, if her friends still solicited a soberer account, Miriam replied,\r\nthat, meeting the old infidel in one of the dismal passages of the\r\ncatacomb, she had entered into controversy with him, hoping to achieve\r\nthe glory and satisfaction of converting him to the Christian faith. For\r\nthe sake of so excellent a result; she had even staked her own salvation\r\nagainst his, binding herself to accompany him back into his penal gloom,\r\nif, within a twelvemonth\xe2\x80\x99s space, she should not have convinced him of\r\nthe errors through which he had so long groped and stumbled. But, alas!\r\nup to the present time, the controversy had gone direfully in favor of\r\nthe man-demon; and Miriam (as she whispered in Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s ear) had awful\r\nforebodings, that, in a few more months, she must take an eternal\r\nfarewell of the sun!\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat remarkable that all her romantic fantasies arrived at\r\nthis self-same dreary termination,--it appeared impossible for her even\r\nto imagine any other than a disastrous result from her connection with\r\nher ill-omened attendant.\r\n\r\nThis singularity might have meant nothing, however, had it not suggested\r\na despondent state of mind, which was likewise indicated by many other\r\ntokens. Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s friends had no difficulty in perceiving that, in\r\none way or another, her happiness was very seriously compromised. Her\r\nspirits were often depressed into deep melancholy. If ever she was gay,\r\nit was seldom with a healthy cheerfulness. She grew moody, moreover, and\r\nsubject to fits of passionate ill temper; which usually wreaked itself\r\non the heads of those who loved her best. Not that Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s indifferent\r\nacquaintances were safe from similar outbreaks of her displeasure,\r\nespecially if they ventured upon any allusion to the model. In such\r\ncases, they were left with little disposition to renew the subject, but\r\ninclined, on the other hand, to interpret the whole matter as much to\r\nher discredit as the least favorable coloring of the facts would allow.\r\n\r\nIt may occur to the reader, that there was really no demand for so much\r\nrumor and speculation in regard to an incident, Which might well enough\r\nhave been explained without going many steps beyond the limits of\r\nprobability. The spectre might have been merely a Roman beggar, whose\r\nfraternity often harbor in stranger shelters than the catacombs; or one\r\nof those pilgrims, who still journey from remote countries to kneel\r\nand worship at the holy sites, among which these haunts of the early\r\nChristians are esteemed especially sacred. Or, as was perhaps a more\r\nplausible theory, he might be a thief of the city, a robber of the\r\nCampagna, a political offender, or an assassin, with blood upon his\r\nhand; whom the negligence or connivance of the police allowed to take\r\nrefuge in those subterranean fastnesses, where such outlaws have been\r\naccustomed to hide themselves from a far antiquity downward. Or he might\r\nhave been a lunatic, fleeing instinctively from man, and making it his\r\ndark pleasure to dwell among the tombs, like him whose awful cry echoes\r\nafar to us from Scripture times.\r\n\r\nAnd, as for the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s attaching himself so devotedly to Miriam, her\r\npersonal magnetism might be allowed a certain weight in the explanation.\r\nFor what remains, his pertinacity need not seem so very singular to\r\nthose who consider how slight a link serves to connect these vagabonds\r\nof idle Italy with any person that may have the ill-hap to bestow\r\ncharity, or be otherwise serviceable to them, or betray the slightest\r\ninterest in their fortunes.\r\n\r\nThus little would remain to be accounted for, except the deportment of\r\nMiriam herself; her reserve, her brooding melancholy, her petulance,\r\nand moody passion. If generously interpreted, even these morbid symptoms\r\nmight have sufficient cause in the stimulating and exhaustive influences\r\nof imaginative art, exercised by a delicate young woman, in the nervous\r\nand unwholesome atmosphere of Rome. Such, at least, was the view of the\r\ncase which Hilda and Kenyon endeavored to impress on their own minds,\r\nand impart to those whom their opinions might influence.\r\n\r\nOne of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s friends took the matter sadly to heart. This was the\r\nyoung Italian. Donatello, as we have seen, had been an eyewitness of\r\nthe stranger\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance, and had ever since nourished a singular\r\nprejudice against the mysterious, dusky, death-scented apparition.\r\nIt resembled not so much a human dislike or hatred, as one of those\r\ninstinctive, unreasoning antipathies which the lower animals sometimes\r\ndisplay, and which generally prove more trustworthy than the acutest\r\ninsight into character. The shadow of the model, always flung into the\r\nlight which Miriam diffused around her, caused no slight trouble to\r\nDonatello. Yet he was of a nature so remarkably genial and joyous, so\r\nsimply happy, that he might well afford to have something subtracted\r\nfrom his comfort, and make tolerable shift to live upon what remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRIAM\xe2\x80\x99S STUDIO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe courtyard and staircase of a palace built three hundred years ago\r\nare a peculiar feature of modern Rome, and interest the stranger more\r\nthan many things of which he has heard loftier descriptions. You pass\r\nthrough the grand breadth and height of a squalid entrance-way, and\r\nperhaps see a range of dusky pillars, forming a sort of cloister round\r\nthe court, and in the intervals, from pillar to pillar, are strewn\r\nfragments of antique statues, headless and legless torsos, and busts\r\nthat have invariably lost what it might be well if living men could lay\r\naside in that unfragrant atmosphere--the nose. Bas-reliefs, the spoil of\r\nsome far older palace, are set in the surrounding walls, every stone of\r\nwhich has been ravished from the Coliseum, or any other imperial ruin\r\nwhich earlier barbarism had not already levelled with the earth. Between\r\ntwo of the pillars, moreover, stands an old sarcophagus without its\r\nlid, and with all its more prominently projecting sculptures broken\r\noff; perhaps it once held famous dust, and the bony framework of some\r\nhistoric man, although now only a receptacle for the rubbish of the\r\ncourtyard, and a half-worn broom.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the court, under the blue Italian sky, and with the\r\nhundred windows of the vast palace gazing down upon it from four sides,\r\nappears a fountain. It brims over from one stone basin to another,\r\nor gushes from a Naiad\xe2\x80\x99s urn, or spurts its many little jets from the\r\nmouths of nameless monsters, which were merely grotesque and artificial\r\nwhen Bernini, or whoever was their unnatural father, first produced\r\nthem; but now the patches of moss, the tufts of grass, the trailing\r\nmaiden-hair, and all sorts of verdant weeds that thrive in the cracks\r\nand crevices of moist marble, tell us that Nature takes the fountain\r\nback into her great heart, and cherishes it as kindly as if it were a\r\nwoodland spring. And hark, the pleasant murmur, the gurgle, the plash!\r\nYou might hear just those tinkling sounds from any tiny waterfall in the\r\nforest, though here they gain a delicious pathos from the stately\r\nechoes that reverberate their natural language. So the fountain is not\r\naltogether glad, after all its three centuries at play!\r\n\r\nIn one of the angles of the courtyard, a pillared doorway gives access\r\nto the staircase, with its spacious breadth of low marble steps, up\r\nwhich, in former times, have gone the princes and cardinals of the great\r\nRoman family who built this palace. Or they have come down, with still\r\ngrander and loftier mien, on their way to the Vatican or the Quirinal,\r\nthere to put off their scarlet hats in exchange for the triple crown.\r\nBut, in fine, all these illustrious personages have gone down\r\ntheir hereditary staircase for the last time, leaving it to be the\r\nthoroughfare of ambassadors, English noblemen, American millionnaires,\r\nartists, tradesmen, washerwomen, and people of every degree,--all of\r\nwhom find such gilded and marble-panelled saloons as their pomp and\r\nluxury demand, or such homely garrets as their necessity can pay for,\r\nwithin this one multifarious abode. Only, in not a single nook of the\r\npalace (built for splendor, and the accommodation of a vast retinue, but\r\nwith no vision of a happy fireside or any mode of domestic enjoyment)\r\ndoes the humblest or the haughtiest occupant find comfort.\r\n\r\nUp such a staircase, on the morning after the scene at the sculpture\r\ngallery, sprang the light foot of Donatello. He ascended from story\r\nto story, passing lofty doorways, set within rich frames of sculptured\r\nmarble, and climbing unweariedly upward, until the glories of the first\r\npiano and the elegance of the middle height were exchanged for a sort of\r\nAlpine region, cold and naked in its aspect. Steps of rough stone, rude\r\nwooden balustrades, a brick pavement in the passages, a dingy whitewash\r\non the walls; these were here the palatial features. Finally, he paused\r\nbefore an oaken door, on which was pinned a card, bearing the name of\r\nMiriam Schaefer, artist in oils. Here Donatello knocked, and the door\r\nimmediately fell somewhat ajar; its latch having been pulled up by means\r\nof a string on the inside. Passing through a little anteroom, he found\r\nhimself in Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, wild Faun,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me the latest news from\r\nArcady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe artist was not just then at her easel, but was busied with the\r\nfeminine task of mending a pair of gloves.\r\n\r\nThere is something extremely pleasant, and even touching,--at least,\r\nof very sweet, soft, and winning effect,--in this peculiarity of\r\nneedlework, distinguishing women from men. Our own sex is incapable of\r\nany such by-play aside from the main business of life; but women--be\r\nthey of what earthly rank they may, however gifted with intellect or\r\ngenius, or endowed with awful beauty--have always some little handiwork\r\nready to fill the tiny gap of every vacant moment. A needle is familiar\r\nto the fingers of them all. A queen, no doubt, plies it on occasion; the\r\nwoman poet can use it as adroitly as her pen; the woman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, that has\r\ndiscovered a new star, turns from its glory to send the polished little\r\ninstrument gleaming along the hem of her kerchief, or to darn a casual\r\nfray in her dress. And they have greatly the advantage of us in this\r\nrespect. The slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them united with\r\nthe small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the continually operating\r\ninfluences of which do so much for the health of the character, and\r\ncarry off what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of morbid\r\nsensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy runs along this electric\r\nline, stretching from the throne to the wicker chair of the humblest\r\nseamstress, and keeping high and low in a species of communion with\r\ntheir kindred beings. Methinks it is a token of healthy and gentle\r\ncharacteristics, when women of high thoughts and accomplishments love\r\nto sew; especially as they are never more at home with their own hearts\r\nthan while so occupied.\r\n\r\nAnd when the work falls in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s lap, of its own accord, and the\r\nneedle involuntarily ceases to fly, it is a sign of trouble, quite as\r\ntrustworthy as the throb of the heart itself. This was what happened\r\nto Miriam. Even while Donatello stood gazing at her, she seemed to have\r\nforgotten his presence, allowing him to drop out of her thoughts, and\r\nthe torn glove to fall from her idle fingers. Simple as he was, the\r\nyoung man knew by his sympathies that something was amiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear lady, you are sad,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, drawing close to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing, Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, resuming her work; \xe2\x80\x9cyes;\r\na little sad, perhaps; but that is not strange for us people of the\r\nordinary world, especially for women. You are of a cheerfuller race, my\r\nfriend, and know nothing of this disease of sadness. But why do you come\r\ninto this shadowy room of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you make it so shadowy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe artists purposely exclude sunshine, and all but a partial light,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we think it necessary to put ourselves at\r\nodds with Nature before trying to imitate her. That strikes you very\r\nstrangely, does it not? But we make very pretty pictures sometimes with\r\nour artfully arranged lights and shadows. Amuse yourself with some\r\nof mine, Donatello, and by and by I shall be in the mood to begin the\r\nportrait we were talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room had the customary aspect of a painter\xe2\x80\x99s studio; one of those\r\ndelightful spots that hardly seem to belong to the actual world, but\r\nrather to be the outward type of a poet\xe2\x80\x99s haunted imagination, where\r\nthere are glimpses, sketches, and half-developed hints of beings and\r\nobjects grander and more beautiful than we can anywhere find in reality.\r\nThe windows were closed with shutters, or deeply curtained, except one,\r\nwhich was partly open to a sunless portion of the sky, admitting only\r\nfrom high upward that partial light which, with its strongly marked\r\ncontrast of shadow, is the first requisite towards seeing objects\r\npictorially. Pencil-drawings were pinned against the wall or scattered\r\non the tables. Unframed canvases turned their backs on the spectator,\r\npresenting only a blank to the eye, and churlishly concealing whatever\r\nriches of scenery or human beauty Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s skill had depicted on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nIn the obscurest part of the room Donatello was half startled at\r\nperceiving duskily a woman with long dark hair, who threw up her arms\r\nwith a wild gesture of tragic despair, and appeared to beckon him into\r\nthe darkness along with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be afraid, Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, smiling to see him peering\r\ndoubtfully into the mysterious dusk. \xe2\x80\x9cShe means you no mischief, nor\r\ncould perpetrate any if she wished it ever so much. It is a lady of\r\nexceedingly pliable disposition; now a heroine of romance, and now a\r\nrustic maid; yet all for show; being created, indeed, on purpose to wear\r\nrich shawls and other garments in a becoming fashion. This is the true\r\nend of her being, although she pretends to assume the most varied duties\r\nand perform many parts in life, while really the poor puppet has nothing\r\non earth to do. Upon my word, I am satirical unawares, and seem to be\r\ndescribing nine women out of ten in the person of my lay-figure. For\r\nmost purposes she has the advantage of the sisterhood. Would I were like\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow it changes her aspect,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Donatello, \xe2\x80\x9cto know that she is\r\nbut a jointed figure! When my eyes first fell upon her, I thought her\r\narms moved, as if beckoning me to help her in some direful peril.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you often troubled with such sinister freaks of fancy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMiriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI should not have supposed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you the truth, dearest signorina,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young Italian,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am apt to be fearful in old, gloomy houses, and in the dark. I love\r\nno dark or dusky corners, except it be in a grotto, or among the thick\r\ngreen leaves of an arbor, or in some nook of the woods, such as I know\r\nmany in the neighborhood of my home. Even there, if a stray sunbeam\r\nsteal in, the shadow is all the better for its cheerful glimmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you are a Faun, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fair artist, laughing at the\r\nremembrance of the scene of the day before. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the world is sadly\r\nchanged nowadays; grievously changed, poor Donatello, since those happy\r\ntimes when your race used to dwell in the Arcadian woods, playing hide\r\nand seek with the nymphs in grottoes and nooks of shrubbery. You have\r\nreappeared on earth some centuries too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand you now,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Donatello, looking perplexed;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9conly, signorina, I am glad to have my lifetime while you live; and\r\nwhere you are, be it in cities or fields, I would fain be there too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether I ought to allow you to speak in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiriam, looking thoughtfully at him. \xe2\x80\x9cMany young women would think it\r\nbehooved them to be offended. Hilda would never let you speak so, I dare\r\nsay. But he is a mere boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, aside, \xe2\x80\x9ca simple boy, putting his\r\nboyish heart to the proof on the first woman whom he chances to meet.\r\nIf yonder lay-figure had had the luck to meet him first, she would have\r\nsmitten him as deeply as I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you angry with me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Donatello dolorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam, frankly giving him her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cPray\r\nlook over some of these sketches till I have leisure to chat with you\r\na little. I hardly think I am in spirits enough to begin your portrait\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello was as gentle and docile as a pet spaniel; as playful, too, in\r\nhis general disposition, or saddening with his mistress\xe2\x80\x99s variable mood\r\nlike that or any other kindly animal which has the faculty of\r\nbestowing its sympathies more completely than men or women can ever do.\r\nAccordingly, as Miriam bade him, he tried to turn his attention to a\r\ngreat pile and confusion of pen and ink sketches and pencil drawings\r\nwhich lay tossed together on a table. As it chanced, however, they gave\r\nthe poor youth little delight.\r\n\r\nThe first that he took up was a very impressive sketch, in which the\r\nartist had jotted down her rough ideas for a picture of Jael driving the\r\nnail through the temples of Sisera. It was dashed off with remarkable\r\npower, and showed a touch or two that were actually lifelike and\r\ndeathlike, as if Miriam had been standing by when Jael gave the first\r\nstroke of her murderous hammer, or as if she herself were Jael, and felt\r\nirresistibly impelled to make her bloody confession in this guise.\r\n\r\nHer first conception of the stern Jewess had evidently been that of\r\nperfect womanhood, a lovely form, and a high, heroic face of lofty\r\nbeauty; but, dissatisfied either with her own work or the terrible story\r\nitself, Miriam had added a certain wayward quirk of her pencil, which at\r\nonce converted the heroine into a vulgar murderess. It was evident that\r\na Jael like this would be sure to search Sisera\xe2\x80\x99s pockets as soon as the\r\nbreath was out of his body.\r\n\r\nIn another sketch she had attempted the story of Judith, which we see\r\nrepresented by the old masters so often, and in such various styles.\r\nHere, too, beginning with a passionate and fiery conception of the\r\nsubject in all earnestness, she had given the last touches in utter\r\nscorn, as it were, of the feelings which at first took such powerful\r\npossession of her hand. The head of Holofernes (which, by the bye, had a\r\npair of twisted mustaches, like those of a certain potentate of the\r\nday) being fairly cut off, was screwing its eyes upward and twirling\r\nits features into a diabolical grin of triumphant malice, which it flung\r\nright in Judith\xe2\x80\x99s face. On her part, she had the startled aspect that\r\nmight be conceived of a cook if a calf\xe2\x80\x99s head should sneer at her when\r\nabout to be popped into the dinner-pot.\r\n\r\nOver and over again, there was the idea of woman, acting the part of a\r\nrevengeful mischief towards man. It was, indeed, very singular to\r\nsee how the artist\xe2\x80\x99s imagination seemed to run on these stories of\r\nbloodshed, in which woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand was crimsoned by the stain; and how,\r\ntoo,--in one form or another, grotesque or sternly sad,--she failed not\r\nto bring out the moral, that woman must strike through her own heart to\r\nreach a human life, whatever were the motive that impelled her.\r\n\r\nOne of the sketches represented the daughter of Herodias receiving the\r\nhead of John the Baptist in a charger. The general conception appeared\r\nto be taken from Bernardo Luini\xe2\x80\x99s picture, in the Uffizzi Gallery at\r\nFlorence; but Miriam had imparted to the saint\xe2\x80\x99s face a look of gentle\r\nand heavenly reproach, with sad and blessed eyes fixed upward at the\r\nmaiden; by the force of which miraculous glance, her whole womanhood was\r\nat once awakened to love and endless remorse.\r\n\r\nThese sketches had a most disagreeable effect on Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar\r\ntemperament. He gave a shudder; his face assumed a look of trouble,\r\nfear, and disgust; he snatched up one sketch after another, as if about\r\nto tear it in pieces. Finally, shoving away the pile of drawings, he\r\nshrank back from the table and clasped his hands over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam, looking up from a\r\nletter which she was now writing. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! I did not mean you to see those\r\ndrawings. They are ugly phantoms that stole out of my mind; not things\r\nthat I created, but things that haunt me. See! here are some trifles\r\nthat perhaps will please you better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a portfolio, the sketches in which indicated a happier mood\r\nof mind, and one, it is to be hoped, more truly characteristic of the\r\nartist. Supposing neither of these classes of subject to show anything\r\nof her own individuality, Miriam had evidently a great scope of fancy,\r\nand a singular faculty of putting what looked like heart into her\r\nproductions. The latter sketches were domestic and common scenes, so\r\nfinely and subtilely idealized that they seemed such as we may see\r\nat any moment, and eye, where; while still there was the indefinable\r\nsomething added, or taken away, which makes all the difference between\r\nsordid life and an earthly paradise. The feeling and sympathy in all of\r\nthem were deep and true. There was the scene, that comes once in every\r\nlife, of the lover winning the soft and pure avowal of bashful affection\r\nfrom the maiden whose slender form half leans towards his arm, half\r\nshrinks from it, we know not which. There was wedded affection in its\r\nsuccessive stages, represented in a series of delicately conceived\r\ndesigns, touched with a holy fire, that burned from youth to age in\r\nthose two hearts, and gave one identical beauty to the faces throughout\r\nall the changes of feature.\r\n\r\nThere was a drawing of an infant\xe2\x80\x99s shoe, half worn out, with the airy\r\nprint of the blessed foot within; a thing that would make a mother smile\r\nor weep out of the very depths of her heart; and yet an actual mother\r\nwould not have been likely to appreciate the poetry of the little shoe,\r\nuntil Miriam revealed it to her. It was wonderful, the depth and force\r\nwith which the above, and other kindred subjects, were depicted, and the\r\nprofound significance which they often acquired. The artist, still in\r\nher fresh youth, could not probably have drawn any of these dear and\r\nrich experiences from her own life; unless, perchance, that first sketch\r\nof all, the avowal of maiden affection, were a remembered incident, and\r\nnot a prophecy. But it is more delightful to believe that, from first to\r\nlast, they were the productions of a beautiful imagination, dealing with\r\nthe warm and pure suggestions of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and thus idealizing\r\na truer and lovelier picture of the life that belongs to woman, than\r\nan actual acquaintance with some of its hard and dusty facts could have\r\ninspired. So considered, the sketches intimated such a force and variety\r\nof imaginative sympathies as would enable Miriam to fill her life richly\r\nwith the bliss and suffering of womanhood, however barren it might\r\nindividually be.\r\n\r\nThere was one observable point, indeed, betokening that the artist\r\nrelinquished, for her personal self, the happiness which she could so\r\nprofoundly appreciate for others. In all those sketches of common life,\r\nand the affections that spiritualize it, a figure was portrayed apart,\r\nnow it peeped between the branches of a shrubbery, amid which two lovers\r\nsat; now it was looking through a frosted window, from the outside,\r\nwhile a young wedded pair sat at their new fireside within; and once it\r\nleaned from a chariot, which six horses were whirling onward in pomp\r\nand pride, and gazed at a scene of humble enjoyment by a cottage door.\r\nAlways it was the same figure, and always depicted with an expression of\r\ndeep sadness; and in every instance, slightly as they were brought out,\r\nthe face and form had the traits of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like these sketches better, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Donatello rather doubtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cNot much, I fear,\xe2\x80\x9d responded she,\r\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what should a boy like you--a Faun too,--know about the\r\njoys and sorrows, the intertwining light and shadow, of human life? I\r\nforgot that you were a Faun. You cannot suffer deeply; therefore you\r\ncan but half enjoy. Here, now, is a subject which you can better\r\nappreciate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sketch represented merely a rustic dance, but with such extravagance\r\nof fun as was delightful to behold; and here there was no drawback,\r\nexcept that strange sigh and sadness which always come when we are\r\nmerriest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to paint the picture in oils,\xe2\x80\x9d said the artist; \xe2\x80\x9cand I want\r\nyou, Donatello, for the wildest dancer of them all. Will you sit for me,\r\nsome day?--or, rather, dance for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, most gladly, signorina!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Donatello. \xe2\x80\x9cSee; it shall be like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith he began to dance, and flit about the studio, like an\r\nincarnate sprite of jollity, pausing at last on the extremity of one\r\ntoe, as if that were the only portion of himself whereby his frisky\r\nnature could come in contact with the earth. The effect in that shadowy\r\nchamber, whence the artist had so carefully excluded the sunshine, was\r\nas enlivening as if one bright ray had contrived to shimmer in and\r\nfrolic around the walls, and finally rest just in the centre of the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was admirable!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, with an approving smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can\r\ncatch you on my canvas, it will be a glorious picture; only I am afraid\r\nyou will dance out of it, by the very truth of the representation, just\r\nwhen I shall have given it the last touch. We will try it one of these\r\ndays. And now, to reward you for that jolly exhibition, you shall see\r\nwhat has been shown to no one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to her easel, on which was placed a picture with its back\r\nturned towards the spectator. Reversing the position, there appeared the\r\nportrait of a beautiful woman, such as one sees only two or three, if\r\neven so many times, in all a lifetime; so beautiful, that she seemed to\r\nget into your consciousness and memory, and could never afterwards be\r\nshut out, but haunted your dreams, for pleasure or for pain; holding\r\nyour inner realm as a conquered territory, though without deigning to\r\nmake herself at home there.\r\n\r\nShe was very youthful, and had what was usually thought to be a Jewish\r\naspect; a complexion in which there was no roseate bloom, yet neither\r\nwas it pale; dark eyes, into which you might look as deeply as your\r\nglance would go, and still be conscious of a depth that you had not\r\nsounded, though it lay open to the day. She had black, abundant hair,\r\nwith none of the vulgar glossiness of other women\xe2\x80\x99s sable locks; if she\r\nwere really of Jewish blood, then this was Jewish hair, and a dark glory\r\nsuch as crowns no Christian maiden\xe2\x80\x99s head. Gazing at this portrait, you\r\nsaw what Rachel might have been, when Jacob deemed her worth the wooing\r\nseven years, and seven more; or perchance she might ripen to be what\r\nJudith was, when she vanquished Holofernes with her beauty, and slew him\r\nfor too much adoring it.\r\n\r\nMiriam watched Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s contemplation of the picture, and seeing his\r\nsimple rapture, a smile of pleasure brightened on her face, mixed with a\r\nlittle scorn; at least, her lips curled, and her eyes gleamed, as if she\r\ndisdained either his admiration or her own enjoyment of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you like the picture, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, beyond what I can tell!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cSo beautiful!--so beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you recognize the likeness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignorina,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Donatello, turning from the picture to the\r\nartist, in astonishment that she should ask the question, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nresemblance is as little to be mistaken as if you had bent over the\r\nsmooth surface of a fountain, and possessed the witchcraft to call forth\r\nthe image that you made there! It is yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello said the truth; and we forebore to speak descriptively of\r\nMiriam\xe2\x80\x99s beauty earlier in our narrative, because we foresaw this\r\noccasion to bring it perhaps more forcibly before the reader.\r\n\r\nWe know not whether the portrait were a flattered likeness; probably\r\nnot, regarding it merely as the delineation of a lovely face; although\r\nMiriam, like all self-painters, may have endowed herself with certain\r\ngraces which Other eyes might not discern. Artists are fond of painting\r\ntheir own portraits; and, in Florence, there is a gallery of hundreds\r\nof them, including the most illustrious, in all of which there are\r\nautobiographical characteristics, so to speak,--traits, expressions,\r\nloftinesses, and amenities, which would have been invisible, had they\r\nnot been painted from within. Yet their reality and truth are none\r\nthe less. Miriam, in like manner, had doubtless conveyed some of the\r\nintimate results of her heart knowledge into her own portrait, and\r\nperhaps wished to try whether they would be perceptible to so simple and\r\nnatural an observer as Donatello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the expression please you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello hesitatingly; \xe2\x80\x9cif it would only smile so like the\r\nsunshine as you sometimes do. No, it is sadder than I thought at first.\r\nCannot you make yourself smile a little, signorina?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA forced smile is uglier than a frown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, a bright, natural\r\nsmile breaking out over her face even as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, catch it now!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello, clapping his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it shine\r\nupon the picture! There! it has vanished already! And you are sad again,\r\nvery sad; and the picture gazes sadly forth at me, as if some evil had\r\nbefallen it in the little time since I looked last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow perplexed you seem, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI really half\r\nbelieve you are a Faun, there is such a mystery and terror for you in\r\nthese dark moods, which are just as natural as daylight to us people of\r\nordinary mould. I advise you, at all events, to look at other faces with\r\nthose innocent and happy eyes, and never more to gaze at mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, with a deeper emphasis than\r\nshe had ever before heard in his voice; \xe2\x80\x9cshroud yourself in what gloom\r\nyou will, I must needs follow you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cbut leave me now; for to\r\nspeak plainly, my good friend, you grow a little wearisome. I walk\r\nthis afternoon in the Borghese grounds. Meet me there, if it suits your\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGIN\xe2\x80\x99S SHRINE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Donatello had left the studio, Miriam herself came forth, and\r\ntaking her way through some of the intricacies of the city, entered what\r\nmight be called either a widening of a street, or a small piazza. The\r\nneighborhood comprised a baker\xe2\x80\x99s oven, emitting the usual fragrance of\r\nsour bread; a shoe shop; a linen-draper\xe2\x80\x99s shop; a pipe and cigar shop; a\r\nlottery office; a station for French soldiers, with a sentinel pacing in\r\nfront; and a fruit-stand, at which a Roman matron was selling the\r\ndried kernels of chestnuts, wretched little figs, and some bouquets of\r\nyesterday. A church, of course, was near at hand, the facade of which\r\nascended into lofty pinnacles, whereon were perched two or three winged\r\nfigures of stone, either angelic or allegorical, blowing stone trumpets\r\nin close vicinity to the upper windows of an old and shabby palace.\r\nThis palace was distinguished by a feature not very common in the\r\narchitecture of Roman edifices; that is to say, a mediaeval tower,\r\nsquare, massive, lofty, and battlemented and machicolated at the summit.\r\n\r\nAt one of the angles of the battlements stood a shrine of the Virgin,\r\nsuch as we see everywhere at the street corners of Rome, but seldom or\r\nnever, except in this solitary, instance, at a height above the ordinary\r\nlevel of men\xe2\x80\x99s views and aspirations. Connected with this old tower and\r\nits lofty shrine, there is a legend which we cannot here pause to tell;\r\nbut for centuries a lamp has been burning before the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s image, at\r\nnoon, at midnight, and at all hours of the twenty-four, and must be kept\r\nburning forever, as long as the tower shall stand; or else the tower\r\nitself, the palace, and whatever estate belongs to it, shall pass from\r\nits hereditary possessor, in accordance with an ancient vow, and become\r\nthe property of the Church.\r\n\r\nAs Miriam approached, she looked upward, and saw,--not, indeed, the\r\nflame of the never-dying lamp, which was swallowed up in the broad\r\nsunlight that brightened the shrine, but a flock of white doves,\r\nskimming, fluttering, and wheeling about the topmost height of the\r\ntower, their silver wings flashing in the pure transparency of the\r\nair. Several of them sat on the ledge of the upper window, pushing one\r\nanother off by their eager struggle for this favorite station, and all\r\ntapping their beaks and flapping their wings tumultuously against the\r\npanes; some had alighted in the street, far below, but flew hastily\r\nupward, at the sound of the window being thrust ajar, and opening in the\r\nmiddle, on rusty hinges, as Roman windows do.\r\n\r\nA fair young girl, dressed in white, showed herself at the aperture for\r\na single instant, and threw forth as much as her two small hands could\r\nhold of some kind of food, for the flock of eleemosynary doves. It\r\nseemed greatly to the taste of the feathered people; for they tried to\r\nsnatch beakfuls of it from her grasp, caught it in the air, and rushed\r\ndownward after it upon the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pretty scene this is,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Miriam, with a kindly smile, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nhow like a dove she is herself, the fair, pure creature! The other doves\r\nknow her for a sister, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiriam passed beneath the deep portal of the palace, and turning to the\r\nleft, began to mount flight after flight of a staircase, which, for the\r\nloftiness of its aspiration, was worthy to be Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s ladder, or, at all\r\nevents, the staircase of the Tower of Babel. The city bustle, which\r\nis heard even in Rome, the rumble of wheels over the uncomfortable\r\npaving-stones, the hard harsh cries reechoing in the high and narrow\r\nstreets, grew faint and died away; as the turmoil of the world will\r\nalways die, if we set our faces to climb heavenward. Higher, and higher\r\nstill; and now, glancing through the successive windows that threw in\r\ntheir narrow light upon the stairs, her view stretched across the roofs\r\nof the city, unimpeded even by the stateliest palaces. Only the domes of\r\nchurches ascend into this airy region, and hold up their golden crosses\r\non a level with her eye; except that, out of the very heart of Rome,\r\nthe column of Antoninus thrusts itself upward, with St. Paul upon its\r\nsummit, the sole human form that seems to have kept her company.\r\n\r\nFinally, the staircase came to an end; save that, on one side of the\r\nlittle entry where it terminated, a flight of a dozen steps gave access\r\nto the roof of the tower and the legendary shrine. On the other side was\r\na door, at which Miriam knocked, but rather as a friendly announcement\r\nof her presence than with any doubt of hospitable welcome; for, awaiting\r\nno response, she lifted the latch and entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a hermitage you have found for yourself, dear Hilda!\xe2\x80\x9d she,\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou breathe sweet air, above all the evil scents of Rome;\r\nand even so, in your maiden elevation, you dwell above our vanities and\r\npassions, our moral dust and mud, with the doves and the angels for your\r\nnearest neighbors. I should not wonder if the Catholics were to make a\r\nsaint of you, like your namesake of old; especially as you have almost\r\navowed yourself of their religion, by undertaking to keep the lamp\r\nalight before the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s shrine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, who had come joyfully forward to greet\r\nher friend. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not call me a Catholic. A Christian girl--even\r\na daughter of the Puritans--may surely pay honor to the idea of divine\r\nWomanhood, without giving up the faith of her forefathers. But how kind\r\nyou are to climb into my dove-cote!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no trifling proof of friendship, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshould think there were three hundred stairs at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will do you good,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cA height of some fifty feet\r\nabove the roofs of Rome gives me all the advantages that I could get\r\nfrom fifty miles of distance. The air so exhilarates my spirits, that\r\nsometimes I feel half inclined to attempt a flight from the top of my\r\ntower, in the faith that I should float upward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t try it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cIf it should turn out\r\nthat you are less than an angel, you would find the stones of the Roman\r\npavement very hard; and if an angel, indeed, I am afraid you would never\r\ncome down among us again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis young American girl was an example of the freedom of life which\r\nit is possible for a female artist to enjoy at Rome. She dwelt in her\r\ntower, as free to descend into the corrupted atmosphere of the city\r\nbeneath, as one of her companion doves to fly downward into the\r\nstreet;--all alone, perfectly independent, under her own sole\r\nguardianship, unless watched over by the Virgin, whose shrine she\r\ntended; doing what she liked without a suspicion or a shadow upon the\r\nsnowy whiteness of her fame. The customs of artist life bestow such\r\nliberty upon the sex, which is elsewhere restricted within so much\r\nnarrower limits; and it is perhaps an indication that, whenever we admit\r\nwomen to a wider scope of pursuits and professions, we must also remove\r\nthe shackles of our present conventional rules, which would then become\r\nan insufferable restraint on either maid or wife. The system seems to\r\nwork unexceptionably in Rome; and in many other cases, as in Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\npurity of heart and life are allowed to assert themselves, and to be\r\ntheir own proof and security, to a degree unknown in the society of\r\nother cities.\r\n\r\nHilda, in her native land, had early shown what was pronounced by\r\nconnoisseurs a decided genius for the pictorial art. Even in her\r\nschooldays--still not so very distant--she had produced sketches that\r\nwere seized upon by men of taste, and hoarded as among the choicest\r\ntreasures of their portfolios; scenes delicately imagined, lacking,\r\nperhaps, the reality which comes only from a close acquaintance with\r\nlife, but so softly touched with feeling and fancy that you seemed to\r\nbe looking at humanity with angels\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. With years and experience\r\nshe might be expected to attain a darker and more forcible touch, which\r\nwould impart to her designs the relief they needed. Had Hilda remained\r\nin her own country, it is not improbable that she might have produced\r\noriginal works worthy to hang in that gallery of native art which,\r\nwe hope, is destined to extend its rich length through many future\r\ncenturies. An orphan, however, without near relatives, and possessed of\r\na little property, she had found it within her possibilities to come\r\nto Italy; that central clime, whither the eyes and the heart of every\r\nartist turn, as if pictures could not be made to glow in any other\r\natmosphere, as if statues could not assume grace and expression, save in\r\nthat land of whitest marble.\r\n\r\nHilda\xe2\x80\x99s gentle courage had brought her safely over land and sea; her\r\nmild, unflagging perseverance had made a place for her in the famous\r\ncity, even like a flower that finds a chink for itself, and a little\r\nearth to grow in, on whatever ancient wall its slender roots may fasten.\r\nHere she dwelt, in her tower, possessing a friend or two in Rome, but\r\nno home companion except the flock of doves, whose cote was in a ruinous\r\nchamber contiguous to her own. They soon became as familiar with the\r\nfair-haired Saxon girl as if she were a born sister of their brood; and\r\nher customary white robe bore such an analogy to their snowy plumage\r\nthat the confraternity of artists called Hilda the Dove, and recognized\r\nher aerial apartment as the Dovecote. And while the other doves flew far\r\nand wide in quest of what was good for them, Hilda likewise spread\r\nher wings, and sought such ethereal and imaginative sustenance as God\r\nordains for creatures of her kind.\r\n\r\nWe know not whether the result of her Italian studies, so far as it\r\ncould yet be seen, will be accepted as a good or desirable one. Certain\r\nit is, that since her arrival in the pictorial land, Hilda seemed to\r\nhave entirely lost the impulse of original design, which brought her\r\nthither. No doubt the girl\xe2\x80\x99s early dreams had been of sending forms and\r\nhues of beauty into the visible world out of her own mind; of compelling\r\nscenes of poetry and history to live before men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, through\r\nconceptions and by methods individual to herself. But more and more, as\r\nshe grew familiar with the miracles of art that enrich so many galleries\r\nin Rome, Hilda had ceased to consider herself as an original artist. No,\r\nwonder that this change should have befallen her. She was endowed with\r\na deep and sensitive faculty of appreciation; she had the gift of\r\ndiscerning and worshipping excellence in a most unusual measure. No\r\nother person, it is probable, recognized so adequately, and enjoyed with\r\nsuch deep delight, the pictorial wonders that were here displayed. She\r\nsaw no, not saw, but felt through and through a picture; she bestowed\r\nupon it all the warmth and richness of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy; not by any\r\nintellectual effort, but by this strength of heart, and this guiding\r\nlight of sympathy, she went straight to the central point, in which the\r\nmaster had conceived his work. Thus she viewed it, as it were, with his\r\nown eyes, and hence her comprehension of any picture that interested her\r\nwas perfect.\r\n\r\nThis power and depth of appreciation depended partly upon Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphysical organization, which was at once healthful and exquisitely\r\ndelicate; and, connected with this advantage, she had a command of\r\nhand, a nicety and force of touch, which is an endowment separate from\r\npictorial genius, though indispensable to its exercise.\r\n\r\nIt has probably happened in many other instances, as it did in Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncase, that she ceased to aim at original achievement in consequence of\r\nthe very gifts which so exquisitely fitted her to profit by familiarity\r\nwith the works of the mighty old masters. Reverencing these wonderful\r\nmen so deeply, she was too grateful for all they bestowed upon her,\r\ntoo loyal, too humble, in their awful presence, to think of enrolling\r\nherself in their society. Beholding the miracles of beauty which they\r\nhad achieved, the world seemed already rich enough in original designs,\r\nand nothing more was so desirable as to diffuse those self-same beauties\r\nmore widely among mankind. All the youthful hopes and ambitions, the\r\nfanciful ideas which she had brought from home, of great pictures to be\r\nconceived in her feminine mind, were flung aside, and, so far as those\r\nmost intimate with her could discern, relinquished without a sigh. All\r\nthat she would henceforth attempt and that most reverently, not to say\r\nreligiously was to catch and reflect some of the glory which had been\r\nshed upon canvas from the immortal pencils of old.\r\n\r\nSo Hilda became a copyist: in the Pinacotheca of the Vatican, in the\r\ngalleries of the Pam-fili-Doria palace, the Borghese, the Corsini, the\r\nSciarra, her easel was set up before many a famous picture by Guido,\r\nDomenichino, Raphael, and the devout painters of earlier schools than\r\nthese. Other artists and visitors from foreign lands beheld the slender,\r\ngirlish figure in front of some world-known work, absorbed, unconscious\r\nof everything around her, seeming to live only in what she sought to do.\r\nThey smiled, no doubt, at the audacity which led her to dream of\r\ncopying those mighty achievements. But, if they paused to look over her\r\nshoulder, and had sensibility enough to understand what was before their\r\neyes, they soon felt inclined to believe that the spirits of the old\r\nmasters were hovering over Hilda, and guiding her delicate white hand.\r\nIn truth, from whatever realm of bliss and many colored beauty those\r\nspirits might descend, it would have been no unworthy errand to help so\r\ngentle and pure a worshipper of their genius in giving the last divine\r\ntouch to her repetitions of their works.\r\n\r\nHer copies were indeed marvellous. Accuracy was not the phrase for them;\r\na Chinese copy is accurate. Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s had that evanescent and ethereal\r\nlife--that flitting fragrance, as it were, of the originals--which it\r\nis as difficult to catch and retain as it would be for a sculptor to\r\nget the very movement and varying color of a living man into his marble\r\nbust. Only by watching the efforts of the most skilful copyists--men who\r\nspend a lifetime, as some of them do, in multiplying copies of a\r\nsingle picture--and observing how invariably they leave out just the\r\nindefinable charm that involves the last, inestimable value, can we\r\nunderstand the difficulties of the task which they undertake.\r\n\r\nIt was not Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s general practice to attempt reproducing the whole of\r\na great picture, but to select some high, noble, and delicate portion\r\nof it, in which the spirit and essence of the picture culminated: the\r\nVirgin\xe2\x80\x99s celestial sorrow, for example, or a hovering angel, imbued\r\nwith immortal light, or a saint with the glow of heaven in his dying\r\nface,--and these would be rendered with her whole soul. If a picture had\r\ndarkened into an indistinct shadow through time and neglect, or had been\r\ninjured by cleaning, or retouched by some profane hand, she seemed to\r\npossess the faculty of seeing it in its pristine glory. The copy would\r\ncome from her hands with what the beholder felt must be the light which\r\nthe old master had left upon the original in bestowing his final and\r\nmost ethereal touch. In some instances even (at least, so those believed\r\nwho best appreciated Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s power and sensibility) she had been enabled\r\nto execute what the great master had conceived in his imagination, but\r\nhad not so perfectly succeeded in putting upon canvas; a result surely\r\nnot impossible when such depth of sympathy as she possessed was assisted\r\nby the delicate skill and accuracy of her slender hand. In such cases\r\nthe girl was but a finer instrument, a more exquisitely effective piece\r\nof mechanism, by the help of which the spirit of some great departed\r\npainter now first achieved his ideal, centuries after his own earthly\r\nhand, that other tool, had turned to dust.\r\n\r\nNot to describe her as too much a wonder, however, Hilda, or the Dove,\r\nas her well-wishers half laughingly delighted to call her, had been\r\npronounced by good judges incomparably the best copyist in Rome. After\r\nminute examination of her works, the most skilful artists declared that\r\nshe had been led to her results by following precisely the same process\r\nstep by step through which the original painter had trodden to the\r\ndevelopment of his idea. Other copyists--if such they are worthy to be\r\ncalled--attempt only a superficial imitation. Copies of the old masters\r\nin this sense are produced by thousands; there are artists, as we have\r\nsaid, who spend their lives in painting the works, or perhaps one single\r\nwork, of one illustrious painter over and over again: thus they\r\nconvert themselves into Guido machines, or Raphaelic machines. Their\r\nperformances, it is true, are often wonderfully deceptive to a careless\r\neye; but working entirely from the outside, and seeking only to\r\nreproduce the surface, these men are sure to leave out that indefinable\r\nnothing, that inestimable something, that constitutes the life and\r\nsoul through which the picture gets its immortality. Hilda was no\r\nsuch machine as this; she wrought religiously, and therefore wrought a\r\nmiracle.\r\n\r\nIt strikes us that there is something far higher and nobler in all this,\r\nin her thus sacrificing herself to the devout recognition of the highest\r\nexcellence in art, than there would have been in cultivating her not\r\ninconsiderable share of talent for the production of works from her own\r\nideas. She might have set up for herself, and won no ignoble name; she\r\nmight have helped to fill the already crowded and cumbered world with\r\npictures, not destitute of merit, but falling short, if by ever so\r\nlittle, of the best that has been done; she might thus have gratified\r\nsome tastes that were incapable of appreciating Raphael. But this could\r\nbe done only by lowering the standard of art to the comprehension of\r\nthe spectator. She chose the better and loftier and more unselfish\r\npart, laying her individual hopes, her fame, her prospects of enduring\r\nremembrance, at the feet of those great departed ones whom she so loved\r\nand venerated; and therefore the world was the richer for this feeble\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nSince the beauty and glory of a great picture are confined within\r\nitself, she won out that glory by patient faith and self-devotion,\r\nand multiplied it for mankind. From the dark, chill corner of a\r\ngallery,--from some curtained chapel in a church, where the light came\r\nseldom and aslant,--from the prince\xe2\x80\x99s carefully guarded cabinet, where\r\nnot one eye in thousands was permitted to behold it, she brought the\r\nwondrous picture into daylight, and gave all its magic splendor for the\r\nenjoyment of the world. Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s faculty of genuine admiration is one of\r\nthe rarest to be found in human nature; and let us try to recompense her\r\nin kind by admiring her generous self-surrender, and her brave, humble\r\nmagnanimity in choosing to be the handmaid of those old magicians,\r\ninstead of a minor enchantress within a circle of her own.\r\n\r\nThe handmaid of Raphael, whom she loved with a virgin\xe2\x80\x99s love! Would it\r\nhave been worth Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s while to relinquish this office for the sake of\r\ngiving the world a picture or two which it would call original; pretty\r\nfancies of snow and moonlight; the counterpart in picture of so many\r\nfeminine achievements in literature!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATRICE\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam was glad to find the Dove in her turret-home; for being endowed\r\nwith an infinite activity, and taking exquisite delight in the sweet\r\nlabor of which her life was full, it was Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s practice to flee abroad\r\nbetimes, and haunt the galleries till dusk. Happy were those (but they\r\nwere very few) whom she ever chose to be the companions of her day; they\r\nsaw the art treasures of Rome, under her guidance, as they had never\r\nseen them before. Not that Hilda could dissertate, or talk learnedly\r\nabout pictures; she would probably have been puzzled by the technical\r\nterms of her own art. Not that she had much to say about what she most\r\nprofoundly admired; but even her silent sympathy was so powerful that\r\nit drew your own along with it, endowing you with a second-sight that\r\nenabled you to see excellences with almost the depth and delicacy of her\r\nown perceptions.\r\n\r\nAll the Anglo-Saxon denizens of Rome, by this time, knew Hilda by sight.\r\nUnconsciously, the poor child had become one of the spectacles of the\r\nEternal City, and was often pointed out to strangers, sitting at her\r\neasel among the wild-bearded young men, the white-haired old ones, and\r\nthe shabbily dressed, painfully plain women, who make up the throng of\r\ncopyists. The old custodes knew her well, and watched over her as their\r\nown child. Sometimes a young artist, instead of going on with a copy\r\nof the picture before which he had placed his easel, would enrich\r\nhis canvas with an original portrait of Hilda at her work. A lovelier\r\nsubject could not have been selected, nor one which required nicer skill\r\nand insight in doing it anything like justice. She was pretty at all\r\ntimes, in our native New England style, with her light-brown ringlets,\r\nher delicately tinged, but healthful cheek, her sensitive, intelligent,\r\nyet most feminine and kindly face. But, every few moments, this pretty\r\nand girlish face grew beautiful and striking, as some inward thought and\r\nfeeling brightened, rose to the surface, and then, as it were, passed\r\nout of sight again; so that, taking into view this constantly recurring\r\nchange, it really seemed as if Hilda were only visible by the sunshine\r\nof her soul.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, she was a good subject for a portrait, being\r\ndistinguished by a gentle picturesqueness, which was perhaps\r\nunconsciously bestowed by some minute peculiarity of dress, such as\r\nartists seldom fail to assume. The effect was to make her appear like an\r\ninhabitant of pictureland, a partly ideal creature, not to be handled,\r\nnor even approached too closely. In her feminine self, Hilda was\r\nnatural, and of pleasant deportment, endowed with a mild cheerfulness of\r\ntemper, not overflowing with animal spirits, but never long despondent.\r\nThere was a certain simplicity that made every one her friend, but it\r\nwas combined with a subtile attribute of reserve, that insensibly kept\r\nthose at a distance who were not suited to her sphere.\r\n\r\nMiriam was the dearest friend whom she had ever known. Being a year or\r\ntwo the elder, of longer acquaintance with Italy, and better fitted to\r\ndeal with its crafty and selfish inhabitants, she had helped Hilda to\r\narrange her way of life, and had encouraged her through those first\r\nweeks, when Rome is so dreary to every newcomer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how lucky that you are at home today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, continuing the\r\nconversation which was begun, many pages back. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly hoped to find\r\nyou, though I had a favor to ask,--a commission to put into your charge.\r\nBut what picture is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, taking her friend\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and leading her in front of\r\nthe easel. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted your opinion of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have really succeeded,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miriam, recognizing the picture\r\nat the first glance, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be the greatest miracle you have yet\r\nachieved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe picture represented simply a female head; a very youthful, girlish,\r\nperfectly beautiful face, enveloped in white drapery, from beneath which\r\nstrayed a lock or two of what seemed a rich, though hidden luxuriance\r\nof auburn hair. The eyes were large and brown, and met those of the\r\nspectator, but evidently with a strange, ineffectual effort to escape.\r\nThere was a little redness about the eyes, very slightly indicated, so\r\nthat you would question whether or no the girl had been weeping. The\r\nwhole face was quiet; there was no distortion or disturbance of any\r\nsingle feature; nor was it easy to see why the expression was not\r\ncheerful, or why a single touch of the artist\xe2\x80\x99s pencil should not\r\nbrighten it into joyousness. But, in fact, it was the very saddest\r\npicture ever painted or conceived; it involved an unfathomable depth of\r\nsorrow, the sense of which came to the observer by a sort of intuition.\r\nIt was a sorrow that removed this beautiful girl out of the sphere\r\nof humanity, and set her in a far-off region, the remoteness of\r\nwhich--while yet her face is so close before us--makes us shiver as at a\r\nspectre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend, after closely examining the picture,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have done nothing else so wonderful as this. But by what unheard-of\r\nsolicitations or secret interest have you obtained leave to copy Guido\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBeatrice Cenci? It is an unexampled favor; and the impossibility\r\nof getting a genuine copy has filled the Roman picture shops with\r\nBeatrices, gay, grievous, or coquettish, but never a true one among\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been one exquisite copy, I have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nan artist capable of appreciating the spirit of the picture. It was\r\nThompson, who brought it away piecemeal, being forbidden (like the\r\nrest of us) to set up his easel before it. As for me, I knew the Prince\r\nBarberini would be deaf to all entreaties; so I had no resource but\r\nto sit down before the picture, day after day, and let it sink into my\r\nheart. I do believe it is now photographed there. It is a sad face to\r\nkeep so close to one\xe2\x80\x99s heart; only what is so very beautiful can never\r\nbe quite a pain. Well; after studying it in this way, I know not how\r\nmany times, I came home, and have done my best to transfer the image to\r\ncanvas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, contemplating Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s work with great\r\ninterest and delight, mixed with the painful sympathy that the picture\r\nexcited. \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere we see oil-paintings, crayon sketches, cameos,\r\nengravings, lithographs, pretending to be Beatrice, and representing the\r\npoor girl with blubbered eyes, a leer of coquetry, a merry look as if\r\nshe were dancing, a piteous look as if she were beaten, and twenty other\r\nmodes of fantastic mistake. But here is Guido\xe2\x80\x99s very Beatrice; she that\r\nslept in the dungeon, and awoke, betimes, to ascend the scaffold, And\r\nnow that you have done it, Hilda, can you interpret what the feeling\r\nis, that gives this picture such a mysterious force? For my part, though\r\ndeeply sensible of its influence, I cannot seize it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor can I, in words,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cBut while I was painting\r\nher, I felt all the time as if she were trying to escape from my gaze.\r\nShe knows that her sorrow is so strange and so immense, that she ought\r\nto be solitary forever, both for the world\xe2\x80\x99s sake and her own; and this\r\nis the reason we feel such a distance between Beatrice and ourselves,\r\neven when our eyes meet hers. It is infinitely heart-breaking to meet\r\nher glance, and to feel that nothing can be done to help or comfort her;\r\nneither does she ask help or comfort, knowing the hopelessness of her\r\ncase better than we do. She is a fallen angel,--fallen, and yet sinless;\r\nand it is only this depth of sorrow, with its weight and darkness, that\r\nkeeps her down upon earth, and brings her within our view even while it\r\nsets her beyond our reach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deem her sinless?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is not so plain to me. If\r\nI can pretend to see at all into that dim region, whence she gazes so\r\nstrangely and sadly at us, Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s own conscience does not acquit her\r\nof something evil, and never to be forgiven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorrow so black as hers oppresses her very nearly as sin would,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think that there was no sin in the deed\r\nfor which she suffered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda, shuddering, \xe2\x80\x9cI really had quite forgotten\r\nBeatrice\xe2\x80\x99s history, and was thinking of her only as the picture seems\r\nto reveal her character. Yes, yes; it was terrible guilt, an inexpiable\r\ncrime, and she feels it to be so. Therefore it is that the forlorn\r\ncreature so longs to elude our eyes, and forever vanish away into\r\nnothingness! Her doom is just!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Hilda, your innocence is like a sharp steel sword!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cYour judgments are often terribly severe, though you seem all\r\nmade up of gentleness and mercy. Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s sin may not have been so\r\ngreat: perhaps it was no sin at all, but the best virtue possible in the\r\ncircumstances. If she viewed it as a sin, it may have been because her\r\nnature was too feeble for the fate imposed upon her. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nMiriam passionately, \xe2\x80\x9cif I could only get within her consciousness!--if\r\nI could but clasp Beatrice Cenci\xe2\x80\x99s ghost, and draw it into myself! I\r\nwould give my life to know whether she thought herself innocent, or the\r\none great criminal since time began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Miriam gave utterance to these words, Hilda looked from the picture\r\ninto her face, and was startled to observe that her friend\xe2\x80\x99s expression\r\nhad become almost exactly that of the portrait; as if her passionate\r\nwish and struggle to penetrate poor Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s mystery had been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Miriam, do not look so!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an\r\nactress you are! And I never guessed it before. Ah! now you are yourself\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, kissing her. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave Beatrice to me in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCover up your magical picture, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her friend, \xe2\x80\x9celse I\r\nnever can look away from it. It is strange, dear Hilda, how an innocent,\r\ndelicate, white soul like yours has been able to seize the subtle\r\nmystery of this portrait; as you surely must, in order to reproduce it\r\nso perfectly. Well; we will not talk of it any more. Do you know, I\r\nhave come to you this morning on a small matter of business. Will you\r\nundertake it for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cif you choose to trust me with\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, it is not a matter of any difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cmerely to\r\ntake charge of this packet, and keep it for me awhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not keep it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartly because it will be safer in your charge,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam a careless sort of person in ordinary things; while you, for all you\r\ndwell so high above the world, have certain little housewifely ways of\r\naccuracy and order. The packet is of some slight importance; and yet, it\r\nmay be, I shall not ask you for it again. In a week or two, you know,\r\nI am leaving Rome. You, setting at defiance the malarial fever, mean to\r\nstay here and haunt your beloved galleries through the summer. Now, four\r\nmonths hence, unless you hear more from me, I would have you deliver the\r\npacket according to its address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda read the direction; it was to Signore Luca Barboni, at the Plazzo\r\nCenci, third piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will deliver it with my own hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely four months\r\nfrom to-day, unless you bid me to the contrary. Perhaps I shall meet the\r\nghost of Beatrice in that grim old palace of her forefathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not fail to speak to her, and\r\ntry to win her confidence. Poor thing! she would be all the better for\r\npouring her heart out freely, and would be glad to do it, if she were\r\nsure of sympathy. It irks my brain and heart to think of her, all shut\r\nup within herself.\xe2\x80\x9d She withdrew the cloth that Hilda had drawn over the\r\npicture, and took another long look at it. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor sister Beatrice! for\r\nshe was still a woman, Hilda, still a sister, be her sin or sorrow what\r\nthey might. How well you have done it, Hilda! I knot not whether Guido\r\nwill thank you, or be jealous of your rivalship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJealous, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Guido had not wrought through\r\nme, my pains would have been thrown away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cif a woman had painted the original\r\npicture, there might have been something in it which we miss now. I\r\nhave a great mind to undertake a copy myself; and try to give it what\r\nit lacks. Well; goodby. But, stay! I am going for a little airing to\r\nthe grounds of the Villa Borghese this afternoon. You will think it very\r\nfoolish, but I always feel the safer in your company, Hilda, slender\r\nlittle maiden as you are. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, not to-day, dearest Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI have set my heart on\r\ngiving another touch or two to this picture, and shall not stir abroad\r\ntill nearly sunset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said her visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cI leave you in your dove-cote. What\r\na sweet, strange life you lead here; conversing with the souls of the\r\nold masters, feeding and fondling your sister doves, and trimming the\r\nVirgin\xe2\x80\x99s lamp! Hilda, do you ever pray to the Virgin while you tend her\r\nshrine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I have been moved to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Dove, blushing,\r\nand lowering her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cshe was a woman once. Do you think it would be\r\nwrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, that is for you to judge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when you pray next,\r\ndear friend, remember me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went down the long descent of the lower staircase, and just as she\r\nreached the street the flock of doves again took their hurried flight\r\nfrom the pavement to the topmost window. She threw her eyes upward\r\nand beheld them hovering about Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s head; for, after her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture, the girl had been more impressed than before by something\r\nvery sad and troubled in her manner. She was, therefore, leaning forth\r\nfrom her airy abode, and flinging down a kind, maidenly kiss, and a\r\ngesture of farewell, in the hope that these might alight upon Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart, and comfort its unknown sorrow a little. Kenyon the sculptor, who\r\nchanced to be passing the head of the street, took note of that ethereal\r\nkiss, and wished that he could have caught it in the air and got Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleave to keep it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBURBAN VILLA\r\n\r\n\r\nDonatello, while it was still a doubtful question betwixt afternoon and\r\nmorning, set forth to keep the appointment which Miriam had carelessly\r\ntendered him in the grounds of the Villa Borghese. The entrance to these\r\ngrounds (as all my readers know, for everybody nowadays has been in\r\nRome) is just outside of the Porta del Popolo. Passing beneath that not\r\nvery impressive specimen of Michael Angelo\xe2\x80\x99s architecture, a minute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk will transport the visitor from the small, uneasy, lava stones\r\nof the Roman pavement into broad, gravelled carriage-drives, whence\r\na little farther stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful\r\nseclusion. A seclusion, but seldom a solitude; for priest, noble, and\r\npopulace, stranger and native, all who breathe Roman air, find free\r\nadmission, and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the\r\nday-dream that they call life.\r\n\r\nBut Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment was of a livelier kind. He soon began to draw\r\nlong and delightful breaths among those shadowy walks. Judging by the\r\npleasure which the sylvan character of the scene excited in him, it\r\nmight be no merely fanciful theory to set him down as the kinsman, not\r\nfar remote, of that wild, sweet, playful, rustic creature, to whose\r\nmarble image he bore so striking a resemblance. How mirthful a discovery\r\nwould it be (and yet with a touch of pathos in it), if the breeze which\r\nsported fondly with his clustering locks were to waft them suddenly\r\naside, and show a pair of leaf-shaped, furry ears! What an honest strain\r\nof wildness would it indicate! and into what regions of rich mystery\r\nwould it extend Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies, to be thus linked (and by no\r\nmonstrous chain) with what we call the inferior trioes of being, whose\r\nsimplicity, mingled with his human intelligence, might partly restore\r\nwhat man has lost of the divine!\r\n\r\nThe scenery amid which the youth now strayed was such as arrays itself\r\nin the imagination when we read the beautiful old myths, and fancy a\r\nbrighter sky, a softer turf, a more picturesque arrangement of venerable\r\ntrees, than we find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the Western\r\nworld. The ilex-trees, so ancient and time-honored were they, seemed to\r\nhave lived for ages undisturbed, and to feel no dread of profanation by\r\nthe axe any more than overthrow by the thunder-stroke. It had already\r\npassed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few years ago they\r\nwere grievously imperilled by the Gaul\xe2\x80\x99s last assault upon the walls of\r\nRome. As if confident in the long peace of their lifetime, they assumed\r\nattitudes of indolent repose. They leaned over the green turf in\r\nponderous grace, throwing abroad their great branches without danger\r\nof interfering with other trees, though other majestic trees grew near\r\nenough for dignified society, but too distant for constraint. Never\r\nwas there a more venerable quietude than that which slept among their\r\nsheltering boughs; never a sweeter sunshine than that now gladdening\r\nthe gentle gloom which these leafy patriarchs strove to diffuse over the\r\nswelling and subsiding lawns.\r\n\r\nIn other portions of the grounds the stone-pines lifted their dense\r\nclump of branches upon a slender length of stem, so high that they\r\nlooked like green islands in the air, flinging down a shadow upon the\r\nturf so far off that you hardly knew which tree had made it. Again,\r\nthere were avenues of cypress, resembling dark flames of huge funeral\r\ncandles, which spread dusk and twilight round about them instead of\r\ncheerful radiance. The more open spots were all abloom, even so early in\r\nthe season, with anemones of wondrous size, both white and rose-colored,\r\nand violets that betrayed themselves by their rich fragrance, even if\r\ntheir blue eyes failed to meet your own. Daisies, too, were abundant,\r\nbut larger than the modest little English flower, and therefore of small\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThese wooded and flowery lawns are more beautiful than the finest\r\nof English park scenery, more touching, more impressive, through the\r\nneglect that leaves Nature so much to her own ways and methods. Since\r\nman seldom interferes with her, she sets to work in her quiet way\r\nand makes herself at home. There is enough of human care, it is true,\r\nbestowed, long ago and still bestowed, to prevent wildness from growing\r\ninto deformity; and the result is an ideal landscape, a woodland scene\r\nthat seems to have been projected out of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s mind. If the ancient\r\nFaun were other than a mere creation of old poetry, and could have\r\nreappeared anywhere, it must have been in such a scene as this.\r\n\r\nIn the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into marble\r\nbasins, the depths of which are shaggy with water-weeds; or they tumble\r\nlike natural cascades from rock to rock, sending their murmur afar, to\r\nmake the quiet and silence more appreciable. Scattered here and there\r\nwith careless artifice, stand old altars bearing Roman inscriptions.\r\nStatues, gray with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere, half\r\nhide and half reveal themselves, high on pedestals, or perhaps fallen\r\nand broken on the turf. Terminal figures, columns of marble or granite\r\nporticos, arches, are seen in the vistas of the wood-paths, either\r\nveritable relics of antiquity, or with so exquisite a touch of artful\r\nruin on them that they are better than if really antique. At all events,\r\ngrass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars, and weeds and flowers\r\nroot themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of\r\ntemples, and clamber at large over their pediments, as if this were the\r\nthousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange idea--what a needless labor--to construct artificial\r\nruins in Rome, the native soil of ruin! But even these sportive\r\nimitations, wrought by man in emulation of what time has done to temples\r\nand palaces, are perhaps centuries old, and, beginning as illusions,\r\nhave grown to be venerable in sober earnest. The result of all is a\r\nscene, pensive, lovely, dreamlike, enjoyable and sad, such as is to\r\nbe found nowhere save in these princely villa-residences in the\r\nneighborhood of Rome; a scene that must have required generations and\r\nages, during which growth, decay, and man\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence wrought kindly\r\ntogether, to render it so gently wild as we behold it now.\r\n\r\nThe final charm is bestowed by the malaria. There is a piercing,\r\nthrilling, delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty thrown\r\naway, or only enjoyable at its half-development, in winter and early\r\nspring, and never to be dwelt amongst, as the home scenery of any human\r\nbeing. For if you come hither in summer, and stray through these glades\r\nin the golden sunset, fever walks arm in arm with you, and death awaits\r\nyou at the end of the dim vista. Thus the scene is like Eden in its\r\nloveliness; like Eden, too, in the fatal spell that removes it beyond\r\nthe scope of man\xe2\x80\x99s actual possessions. But Donatello felt nothing of\r\nthis dream-like melancholy that haunts the spot. As he passed among the\r\nsunny shadows, his spirit seemed to acquire new elasticity. The flicker\r\nof the sunshine, the sparkle of the fountain\xe2\x80\x99s gush, the dance of the\r\nleaf upon the bough, the woodland fragrance, the green freshness,\r\nthe old sylvan peace and freedom, were all intermingled in those long\r\nbreaths which he drew.\r\n\r\nThe ancient dust, the mouldiness of Rome, the dead atmosphere in which\r\nhe had wasted so many months, the hard pavements, the smell of ruin and\r\ndecaying generations, the chill palaces, the convent bells, the heavy\r\nincense of altars, the life that he had led in those dark, narrow\r\nstreets, among priests, soldiers, nobles, artists, and women,--all the\r\nsense of these things rose from the young man\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness like a\r\ncloud which had darkened over him without his knowing how densely.\r\n\r\nHe drank in the natural influences of the scene, and was intoxicated as\r\nby an exhilarating wine. He ran races with himself along the gleam and\r\nshadow of the wood-paths. He leapt up to catch the overhanging bough of\r\nan ilex, and swinging himself by it alighted far onward, as if he had\r\nflown thither through the air. In a sudden rapture he embraced the\r\ntrunk of a sturdy tree, and seemed to imagine it a creature worthy of\r\naffection and capable of a tender response; he clasped it closely in his\r\narms, as a Faun might have clasped the warm feminine grace of the nymph,\r\nwhom antiquity supposed to dwell within that rough, encircling rind.\r\nThen, in order to bring himself closer to the genial earth, with which\r\nhis kindred instincts linked him so strongly, he threw himself at full\r\nlength on the turf, and pressed down his lips, kissing the violets and\r\ndaisies, which kissed him back again, though shyly, in their maiden\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nWhile he lay there, it was pleasant to see how the green and blue\r\nlizards, who had beta basking on some rock or on a fallen pillar that\r\nabsorbed the warmth of the sun, scrupled not to scramble over him with\r\ntheir small feet; and how the birds alighted on the nearest twigs and\r\nsang their little roundelays unbroken by any chirrup of alarm; they\r\nrecognized him, it may be, as something akin to themselves, or else they\r\nfancied that he was rooted and grew there; for these wild pets of nature\r\ndreaded him no more in his buoyant life than if a mound of soil and\r\ngrass and flowers had long since covered his dead body, converting it\r\nback to the sympathies from which human existence had estranged it.\r\n\r\nAll of us, after a long abode in cities, have felt the blood gush more\r\njoyously through our veins with the first breath of rural air; few could\r\nfeel it so much as Donatello, a creature of simple elements, bred in\r\nthe sweet sylvan life of Tuscany, and for months back dwelling amid the\r\nmouldy gloom and dim splendor of old Rome. Nature has been shut out for\r\nnumberless centuries from those stony-hearted streets, to which he had\r\nlatterly grown accustomed; there is no trace of her, except for what\r\nblades of grass spring out of the pavements of the less trodden piazzas,\r\nor what weeds cluster and tuft themselves on the cornices of ruins.\r\nTherefore his joy was like that of a child that had gone astray from\r\nhome, and finds him suddenly in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms again.\r\n\r\nAt last, deeming it full time for Miriam to keep her tryst, he climbed\r\nto the tiptop of the tallest tree, and thence looked about him, swaying\r\nto and fro in the gentle breeze, which was like the respiration of that\r\ngreat leafy, living thing. Donatello saw beneath him the whole circuit\r\nof the enchanted ground; the statues and columns pointing upward from\r\namong the shrubbery, the fountains flashing in the sunlight, the paths\r\nwinding hither and thither, and continually finding out some nook of new\r\nand ancient pleasantness. He saw the villa, too, with its marble front\r\nincrusted all over with basreliefs, and statues in its many niches. It\r\nwas as beautiful as a fairy palace, and seemed an abode in which the\r\nlord and lady of this fair domain might fitly dwell, and come forth each\r\nmorning to enjoy as sweet a life as their happiest dreams of the past\r\nnight could have depicted. All this he saw, but his first glance had\r\ntaken in too wide a sweep, and it was not till his eyes fell almost\r\ndirectly beneath him, that Donatello beheld Miriam just turning into the\r\npath that led across the roots of his very tree.\r\n\r\nHe descended among the foliage, waiting for her to come close to the\r\ntrunk, and then suddenly dropped from an impending bough, and alighted\r\nat her side. It was as if the swaying of the branches had let a ray\r\nof sunlight through. The same ray likewise glimmered among the gloomy\r\nmeditations that encompassed Miriam, and lit up the pale, dark beauty of\r\nher face, while it responded pleasantly to Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly know,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you have sprouted out of\r\nthe earth, or fallen from the clouds. In either case you are welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they walked onward together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAUN AND NYMPH\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam\xe2\x80\x99s sadder mood, it might be, had at first an effect on Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspirits. It checked the joyous ebullition into which they would\r\notherwise have effervesced when he found himself in her society, not, as\r\nheretofore, in the old gloom of Rome, but under that bright soft sky and\r\nin those Arcadian woods. He was silent for a while; it being, indeed,\r\nseldom Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s impulse to express himself copiously in words. His\r\nusual modes of demonstration were by the natural language of gesture,\r\nthe instinctive movement of his agile frame, and the unconscious play\r\nof his features, which, within a limited range of thought and emotion,\r\nwould speak volumes in a moment.\r\n\r\nBy and by, his own mood seemed to brighten Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s, and was reflected\r\nback upon himself. He began inevitably, as it were, to dance along\r\nthe wood-path; flinging himself into attitudes of strange comic grace.\r\nOften, too, he ran a little way in advance of his companion, and then\r\nstood to watch her as she approached along the shadowy and sun-fleckered\r\npath. With every step she took, he expressed his joy at her nearer\r\nand nearer presence by what might be thought an extravagance of\r\ngesticulation, but which doubtless was the language of the natural man,\r\nthough laid aside and forgotten by other men, now that words have been\r\nfeebly substituted in the place of signs and symbols. He gave Miriam the\r\nidea of a being not precisely man, nor yet a child, but, in a high and\r\nbeautiful sense, an animal, a creature in a state of development less\r\nthan what mankind has attained, yet the more perfect within itself\r\nfor that very deficiency. This idea filled her mobile imagination with\r\nagreeable fantasies, which, after smiling at them herself, she tried to\r\nconvey to the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, always keeping in mind his\r\nsingular resemblance to the Faun of the Capitol. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are, in good\r\ntruth, that wild and pleasant creature whose face you wear, pray make me\r\nknown to your kindred. They will be found hereabouts, if anywhere. Knock\r\nat the rough rind of this ilex-tree, and summon forth the Dryad! Ask the\r\nwater-nymph to rise dripping from yonder fountain, and exchange a moist\r\npressure of the hand with me! Do not fear that I shall shrink; even if\r\none of your rough cousins, a hairy Satyr, should come capering on his\r\ngoat-legs out of the haunts of far antiquity, and propose to dance with\r\nme among these lawns! And will not Bacchus,--with whom you consorted so\r\nfamiliarly of old, and who loved you so well,--will he not meet us here,\r\nand squeeze rich grapes into his cup for you and me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello smiled; he laughed heartily, indeed, in sympathy with the\r\nmirth that gleamed out of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s deep, dark eyes. But he did not seem\r\nquite to understand her mirthful talk, nor to be disposed to explain\r\nwhat kind of creature he was, or to inquire with what divine or poetic\r\nkindred his companion feigned to link him. He appeared only to know that\r\nMiriam was beautiful, and that she smiled graciously upon him; that\r\nthe present moment was very sweet, and himself most happy, with the\r\nsunshine, the sylvan scenery, and woman\xe2\x80\x99s kindly charm, which it\r\nenclosed within its small circumference. It was delightful to see the\r\ntrust which he reposed in Miriam, and his pure joy in her propinquity;\r\nhe asked nothing, sought nothing, save to be near the beloved object,\r\nand brimmed over with ecstasy at that simple boon. A creature of the\r\nhappy tribes below us sometimes shows the capacity of this enjoyment; a\r\nman, seldom or never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, looking at him thoughtfully, but amused, yet\r\nnot without a shade of sorrow, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem very happy; what makes you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Donatello.\r\n\r\nHe made this momentous confession as if it were the most natural\r\nthing in the world; and on her part,--such was the contagion of his\r\nsimplicity,--Miriam heard it without anger or disturbance, though with\r\nno responding emotion. It was as if they had strayed across the limits\r\nof Arcadia; and come under a civil polity where young men might avow\r\ntheir passion with as little restraint as a bird pipes its note to a\r\nsimilar purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you love me, foolish boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no points of\r\nsympathy at all. There are not two creatures more unlike, in this wide\r\nworld, than you and I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are yourself, and I am Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore I love\r\nyou! There needs no other reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertainly, there was no better or more explicable reason. It might\r\nhave been imagined that Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s unsophisticated heart would be more\r\nreadily attracted to a feminine nature of clear simplicity like his own,\r\nthan to one already turbid with grief or wrong, as Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to\r\nbe. Perhaps, On the other hand, his character needed the dark element,\r\nwhich it found in her. The force and energy of will, that sometimes\r\nflashed through her eyes, may have taken him captive; or, not\r\nimprobably, the varying lights and shadows of her temper, now so\r\nmirthful, and anon so sad with mysterious gloom, had bewitched the\r\nyouth. Analyze the matter as we may, the reason assigned by Donatello\r\nhimself was as satisfactory as we are likely to attain.\r\n\r\nMiriam could not think seriously of the avowal that had passed. He held\r\nout his love so freely, in his open palm, that she felt it could be\r\nnothing but a toy, which she might play with for an instant, and give\r\nback again. And yet Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s heart was so fresh a fountain, that,\r\nhad Miriam been more world-worn than she was, she might have found\r\nit exquisite to slake her thirst with the feelings that welled up and\r\nbrimmed over from it. She was far, very far, from the dusty mediaeval\r\nepoch, when some women have a taste for such refreshment. Even for\r\nher, however, there was an inexpressible charm in the simplicity that\r\nprompted Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s words and deeds; though, unless she caught them\r\nin precisely the true light, they seemed but folly, the offspring of\r\na maimed or imperfectly developed intellect. Alternately, she almost\r\nadmired, or wholly scorned him, and knew not which estimate resulted\r\nfrom the deeper appreciation. But it could not, she decided for herself,\r\nbe other than an innocent pastime, if they two--sure to be separated by\r\ntheir different paths in life, to-morrow--were to gather up some of the\r\nlittle pleasures that chanced to grow about their feet, like the violets\r\nand wood-anemones, to-day.\r\n\r\nYet an impulse of rectitude impelled Miriam to give him what she still\r\nheld to be a needless warning against an imaginary peril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were wiser, Donatello, you would think me a dangerous person,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said she, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you follow my footsteps, they will lead you to no good.\r\nYou ought to be afraid of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would as soon think of fearing the air we breathe,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well you may, for it is full of malaria,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam; she went on,\r\nhinting at an intangible confession, such as persons with overburdened\r\nhearts often make to children or dumb animals, or to holes in the earth,\r\nwhere they think their secrets may be at once revealed and buried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who come too near me are in danger of great mischiefs, I do\r\nassure you. Take warning, therefore! It is a sad fatality that has\r\nbrought you from your home among the Apennines,--some rusty old castle,\r\nI suppose, with a village at its foot, and an Arcadian environment of\r\nvineyards, fig-trees, and olive orchards,--a sad mischance, I say, that\r\nhas transported you to my side. You have had a happy life hitherto, have\r\nyou not, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the young man; and, though not of a retrospective\r\nturn, he made the best effort he could to send his mind back into the\r\npast. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember thinking it happiness to dance with the contadinas at\r\na village feast; to taste the new, sweet wine at vintage-time, and the\r\nold, ripened wine, which our podere is famous for, in the cold winter\r\nevenings; and to devour great, luscious figs, and apricots, peaches,\r\ncherries, and melons. I was often happy in the woods, too, with hounds\r\nand horses, and very happy in watching all sorts, of creatures and birds\r\nthat haunt the leafy solitudes. But never half so happy as now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn these delightful groves?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, and with you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Donatello. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as we are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fulness of content in him! How silly, and how delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiriam to herself. Then addressing him again: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Donatello, how long\r\nwill this happiness last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; for it perplexed him even more to think of the\r\nfuture than to remember the past. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it have any end? How long!\r\nForever! forever! forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child! the simpleton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, with sudden laughter, and\r\nchecking it as suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut is he a simpleton indeed? Here, in those\r\nfew natural words, he has expressed that deep sense, that profound\r\nconviction of its own immortality, which genuine love never fails to\r\nbring. He perplexes me,--yes, and bewitches me,--wild, gentle, beautiful\r\ncreature that he is! It is like playing with a young greyhound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes filled with tears, at the same time that a smile shone out of\r\nthem. Then first she became sensible of a delight and grief at once, in\r\nfeeling this zephyr of a new affection, with its untainted freshness,\r\nblow over her weary, stifled heart, which had no right to be revived by\r\nit. The very exquisiteness of the enjoyment made her know that it ought\r\nto be a forbidden one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastily exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your own sake, leave me! It is\r\nnot such a happy thing as you imagine it, to wander in these woods with\r\nme, a girl from another land, burdened with a doom that she tells to\r\nnone. I might make you dread me,--perhaps hate me,--if I chose; and I\r\nmust choose, if I find you loving me too well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello, looking into her unfathomable eyes\r\nwith perfect trust. \xe2\x80\x9cI love always!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Miriam within herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, for this one hour, let me be such as he imagines me.\r\nTo-morrow will be time enough to come back to my reality. My reality!\r\nwhat is it? Is the past so indestructible? the future so immitigable?\r\nIs the dark dream, in which I walk, of such solid, stony substance, that\r\nthere can be no escape out of its dungeon? Be it so! There is, at\r\nleast, that ethereal quality in my spirit, that it can make me as gay as\r\nDonatello himself,--for this one hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd immediately she brightened up, as if an inward flame, heretofore\r\nstifled, were now permitted to fill her with its happy lustre, glowing\r\nthrough her cheeks and dancing in her eye-beams.\r\n\r\nDonatello, brisk and cheerful as he seemed before, showed a sensibility\r\nto Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s gladdened mood by breaking into still wilder and\r\never-varying activity. He frisked around her, bubbling over with joy,\r\nwhich clothed itself in words that had little individual meaning, and\r\nin snatches of song that seemed as natural as bird notes. Then they both\r\nlaughed together, and heard their own laughter returning in the echoes,\r\nand laughed again at the response, so that the ancient and solemn grove\r\nbecame full of merriment for these two blithe spirits. A bird happening\r\nto sing cheerily, Donatello gave a peculiar call, and the little\r\nfeathered creature came fluttering about his head, as if it had known\r\nhim through many summers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow close he stands to nature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, observing this pleasant\r\nfamiliarity between her companion and the bird. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall make me as\r\nnatural as himself for this one hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they strayed through that sweet wilderness, she felt more and more\r\nthe influence of his elastic temperament. Miriam was an impressible\r\nand impulsive creature, as unlike herself, in different moods, as if a\r\nmelancholy maiden and a glad one were both bound within the girdle about\r\nher waist, and kept in magic thraldom by the brooch that clasped it.\r\nNaturally, it is true, she was the more inclined to melancholy,\r\nyet fully capable of that high frolic of the spirits which richly\r\ncompensates for many gloomy hours; if her soul was apt to lurk in the\r\ndarkness of a cavern, she could sport madly in the sunshine before\r\nthe cavern\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Except the freshest mirth of animal spirits, like\r\nDonatello\xe2\x80\x99s, there is no merriment, no wild exhilaration, comparable to\r\nthat of melancholy people escaping from the dark region in which it is\r\ntheir custom to keep themselves imprisoned.\r\n\r\nSo the shadowy Miriam almost outdid Donatello on his own ground. They\r\nran races with each other, side by side, with shouts and laughter; they\r\npelted one another with early flowers, and gathering them up twined\r\nthem with green leaves into garlands for both their heads. They played\r\ntogether like children, or creatures of immortal youth. So much had they\r\nflung aside the sombre habitudes of daily life, that they seemed born\r\nto be sportive forever, and endowed with eternal mirthfulness instead\r\nof any deeper joy. It was a glimpse far backward into Arcadian life, or,\r\nfurther still, into the Golden Age, before mankind was burdened with\r\nsin and sorrow, and before pleasure had been darkened with those shadows\r\nthat bring it into high relief, and make it happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello, stopping short, as he was about to bind\r\nMiriam\xe2\x80\x99s fair hands with flowers, and lead her along in triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nis music somewhere in the grove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your kinsman, Pan, most likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cplaying on his\r\npipe. Let us go seek him, and make him puff out his rough cheeks and\r\npipe his merriest air! Come; the strain of music will guide us onward\r\nlike a gayly colored thread of silk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr like a chain of flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Donatello, drawing her along by\r\nthat which he had twined. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way!--Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYLVAN DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the music came fresher on their ears, they danced to its cadence,\r\nextemporizing new steps and attitudes. Each varying movement had a grace\r\nwhich might have been worth putting into marble, for the long delight of\r\ndays to come, but vanished with the movement that gave it birth, and was\r\neffaced from memory by another. In Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s motion, freely as she flung\r\nherself into the frolic of the hour, there was still an artful beauty;\r\nin Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s, there was a charm of indescribable grotesqueness hand\r\nin hand with grace; sweet, bewitching, most provocative of laughter,\r\nand yet akin to pathos, so deeply did it touch the heart. This was the\r\nultimate peculiarity, the final touch, distinguishing between the sylvan\r\ncreature and the beautiful companion at his side. Setting apart only\r\nthis, Miriam resembled a Nymph, as much as Donatello did a Faun.\r\n\r\nThere were flitting moments, indeed, when she played the sylvan\r\ncharacter as perfectly as he. Catching glimpses of her, then, you would\r\nhave fancied that an oak had sundered its rough bark to let her dance\r\nfreely forth, endowed with the same spirit in her human form as that\r\nwhich rustles in the leaves; or that she had emerged through the\r\npebbly bottom of a fountain, a water-nymph, to play and sparkle in\r\nthe sunshine, flinging a quivering light around her, and suddenly\r\ndisappearing in a shower of rainbow drops.\r\n\r\nAs the fountain sometimes subsides into its basin, so in Miriam there\r\nwere symptoms that the frolic of her spirits would at last tire itself\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, laughing, as she stopped to take a breath;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou have an unfair advantage over me! I am no true creature of the\r\nwoods; while you are a real Faun, I do believe. When your curls shook\r\njust now, methought I had a peep at the pointed ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello snapped his fingers above his head, as fauns and satyrs taught\r\nus first to do, and seemed to radiate jollity out of his whole nimble\r\nperson. Nevertheless, there was a kind of dim apprehension in his face,\r\nas if he dreaded that a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause might break the spell, and snatch\r\naway the sportive companion whom he had waited for through so many\r\ndreary months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDance! dance!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he joyously. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we take breath, we shall be as\r\nwe were yesterday. There, now, is the music, just beyond this clump of\r\ntrees. Dance, Miriam, dance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had now reached an open, grassy glade (of which there are many in\r\nthat artfully constructed wilderness), set round with stone seats,\r\non which the aged moss had kindly essayed to spread itself instead of\r\ncushions. On one of the stone benches sat the musicians, whose strains\r\nhad enticed our wild couple thitherward. They proved to be a vagrant\r\nband, such as Rome, and all Italy, abounds with; comprising a harp,\r\na flute, and a violin, which, though greatly the worse for wear,\r\nthe performers had skill enough to provoke and modulate into tolerable\r\nharmony. It chanced to be a feast-day; and, instead of playing in\r\nthe sun-scorched piazzas of the city, or beneath the windows of some\r\nunresponsive palace, they had bethought themselves to try the echoes\r\nof these woods; for, on the festas of the Church, Rome scatters its\r\nmerrymakers all abroad, ripe for the dance or any other pastime.\r\n\r\nAs Miriam and Donatello emerged from among the trees, the musicians\r\nscraped, tinkled, or blew, each according to his various kind of\r\ninstrument, more inspiringly than ever. A darkchecked little girl,\r\nwith bright black eyes, stood by, shaking a tambourine set round\r\nwith tinkling bells, and thumping it on its parchment head. Without\r\ninterrupting his brisk, though measured movement, Donatello snatched\r\naway this unmelodious contrivance, and, flourishing it above his head,\r\nproduced music of indescribable potency, still dancing with frisky step,\r\nand striking the tambourine, and ringing its little bells, all in one\r\njovial act.\r\n\r\nIt might be that there was magic in the sound, or contagion, at least,\r\nin the spirit which had got possession of Miriam and himself, for very\r\nsoon a number of festal people were drawn to the spot, and struck\r\ninto the dance, singly or in pairs, as if they were all gone mad with\r\njollity. Among them were some of the plebeian damsels whom we meet\r\nbareheaded in the Roman streets, with silver stilettos thrust through\r\ntheir glossy hair; the contadinas, too, from the Campagna and the\r\nvillages, with their rich and picturesque costumes of scarlet and all\r\nbright hues, such as fairer maidens might not venture to put on. Then\r\ncame the modern Roman from Trastevere, perchance, with his old cloak\r\ndrawn about him like a toga, which anon, as his active motion heated\r\nhim, he flung aside. Three French soldiers capered freely into the\r\nthrong, in wide scarlet trousers, their short swords dangling at their\r\nsides; and three German artists in gray flaccid hats and flaunting\r\nbeards; and one of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Swiss guardsmen in the strange motley garb\r\nwhich Michael Angelo contrived for them. Two young English tourists (one\r\nof them a lord) took contadine partners and dashed in, as did also a\r\nshaggy man in goat-skin breeches, who looked like rustic Pan in person,\r\nand footed it as merrily as he. Besides the above there was a herdsman\r\nor two from the Campagna, and a few peasants in sky-blue jackets, and\r\nsmall-clothes tied with ribbons at the knees; haggard and sallow were\r\nthese last, poor serfs, having little to eat and nothing but the malaria\r\nto breathe; but still they plucked up a momentary spirit and joined\r\nhands in Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s dance.\r\n\r\nHere, as it seemed, had the Golden Age come back again within the\r\nPrecincts of this sunny glade, thawing mankind out of their cold\r\nformalities, releasing them from irksome restraint, mingling them\r\ntogether in such childlike gayety that new flowers (of which the old\r\nbosom of the earth is full) sprang up beneath their footsteps. The sole\r\nexception to the geniality of the moment, as we have understood, was\r\nseen in a countryman of our own, who sneered at the spectacle, and\r\ndeclined to compromise his dignity by making part of it.\r\n\r\nThe harper thrummed with rapid fingers; the violin player flashed his\r\nbow back and forth across the strings; the flautist poured his breath in\r\nquick puffs of jollity, while Donatello shook the tambourine above his\r\nhead, and led the merry throng with unweariable steps. As they followed\r\none another in a wild ring of mirth, it seemed the realization of one\r\nof those bas-reliefs where a dance of nymphs, satyrs, or bacchanals\r\nis twined around the circle of an antique vase; or it was like the\r\nsculptured scene on the front and sides of a sarcophagus, where, as\r\noften as any other device, a festive procession mocks the ashes and\r\nwhite bones that are treasured up within. You might take it for a\r\nmarriage pageant; but after a while, if you look at these merry-makers,\r\nfollowing them from end to end of the marble coffin, you doubt whether\r\ntheir gay movement is leading them to a happy close. A youth has\r\nsuddenly fallen in the dance; a chariot is overturned and broken,\r\nflinging the charioteer headlong to the ground; a maiden seems to have\r\ngrown faint or weary, and is drooping on the bosom of a friend. Always\r\nsome tragic incident is shadowed forth or thrust sidelong into the\r\nspectacle; and when once it has caught your eye you can look no more\r\nat the festal portions of the scene, except with reference to this one\r\nslightly suggested doom and sorrow.\r\n\r\nAs in its mirth, so in the darker characteristic here alluded to, there\r\nwas an analogy between the sculptured scene on the sarcophagus and the\r\nwild dance which we have been describing. In the midst of its madness\r\nand riot Miriam found herself suddenly confronted by a strange figure\r\nthat shook its fantastic garments in the air, and pranced before her on\r\nits tiptoes, almost vying with the agility of Donatello himself. It was\r\nthe model.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards Donatello was aware that she had retired from the\r\ndance. He hastened towards her, and flung himself on the grass beside\r\nthe stone bench on which Miriam was sitting. But a strange distance and\r\nunapproachableness had all at once enveloped her; and though he saw her\r\nwithin reach of his arm, yet the light of her eyes seemed as far off as\r\nthat of a star, nor was there any warmth in the melancholy smile with\r\nwhich she regarded him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should this happy hour end so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must end here, Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in answer to his words and\r\noutstretched hand; \xe2\x80\x9cand such hours, I believe, do not often repeat\r\nthemselves in a lifetime. Let me go, my friend; let me vanish from you\r\nquietly among the shadows of these trees. See, the companions of our\r\npastime are vanishing already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the harp-strings were broken, the violin out of\r\ntune, or the flautist out of breath, so it chanced that the music had\r\nceased, and the dancers come abruptly to a pause. All that motley throng\r\nof rioters was dissolved as suddenly as it had been drawn together. In\r\nMiriam\xe2\x80\x99s remembrance the scene had a character of fantasy. It was as if\r\na company of satyrs, fauns, and nymphs, with Pan in the midst of them,\r\nhad been disporting themselves in these venerable woods only a moment\r\nago; and now in another moment, because some profane eye had looked at\r\nthem too closely, or some intruder had cast a shadow on their mirth,\r\nthe sylvan pageant had utterly disappeared. If a few of the merry-makers\r\nlingered among the trees, they had hidden their racy peculiarities under\r\nthe garb and aspect of ordinary people, and sheltered themselves in the\r\nweary commonplace of daily life. Just an instant before it was Arcadia\r\nand the Golden Age. The spell being broken, it was now only that old\r\ntract of pleasure ground, close by the people\xe2\x80\x99s gate of Rome,--a\r\ntract where the crimes and calamities of ages, the many battles, blood\r\nrecklessly poured out, and deaths of myriads, have corrupted all the\r\nsoil, creating an influence that makes the air deadly to human lungs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam to Donatello more imperatively than\r\nbefore; \xe2\x80\x9chave I not said it? Go; and look not behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiriam,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Donatello, grasping her hand forcibly, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is it\r\nthat stands in the shadow yonder, beckoning you to follow him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush; leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cYour hour is past; his hour has\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello still gazed in the direction which he had indicated, and\r\nthe expression of his face was fearfully changed, being so disordered,\r\nperhaps with terror,--at all events with anger and invincible\r\nrepugnance,--that Miriam hardly knew him. His lips were drawn apart so\r\nas to disclose his set teeth, thus giving him a look of animal rage,\r\nwhich we seldom see except in persons of the simplest and rudest\r\nnatures. A shudder seemed to pass through his very bones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate him!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied; I hate him too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam.\r\n\r\nShe had no thought of making this avowal, but was irresistibly drawn to\r\nit by the sympathy of the dark emotion in her own breast with that so\r\nstrongly expressed by Donatello. Two drops of water or of blood do not\r\nmore naturally flow into each other than did her hatred into his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I clutch him by the throat?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Donatello, with a savage\r\nscowl. \xe2\x80\x9cBid me do so, and we are rid of him forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, no violence!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam, affrighted out of the\r\nscornful control which she had hitherto held over her companion, by\r\nthe fierceness that he so suddenly developed. \xe2\x80\x9cO, have pity on\r\nme, Donatello, if for nothing else, yet because in the midst of my\r\nwretchedness I let myself be your playmate for this one wild\r\nhour! Follow me no farther. Henceforth leave me to my doom. Dear\r\nfriend,--kind, simple, loving friend,--make me not more wretched by the\r\nremembrance of having thrown fierce hates or loves into the wellspring\r\nof your happy life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot follow you!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Donatello, soothed from anger into sorrow,\r\nless by the purport of what she said, than by the melancholy sweetness\r\nof her voice,--\xe2\x80\x9cnot follow you! What other path have I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk of it once again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam still soothingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csoon--to-morrow when you will; only leave me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTARY SENTENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Borghese Grove, so recently uproarious with merriment and music,\r\nthere remained only Miriam and her strange follower.\r\n\r\nA solitude had suddenly spread itself around them. It perhaps symbolized\r\na peculiar character in the relation of these two, insulating them, and\r\nbuilding up an insuperable barrier between their life-streams and other\r\ncurrents, which might seem to flow in close vicinity. For it is one of\r\nthe chief earthly incommodities of some species of misfortune, or of a\r\ngreat crime, that it makes the actor in the one, or the sufferer of\r\nthe other, an alien in the world, by interposing a wholly unsympathetic\r\nmedium betwixt himself and those whom he yearns to meet.\r\n\r\nOwing, it may be, to this moral estrangement,--this chill remoteness of\r\ntheir position,--there have come to us but a few vague whisperings\r\nof what passed in Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s interview that afternoon with the sinister\r\npersonage who had dogged her footsteps ever since the visit to the\r\ncatacomb. In weaving these mystic utterances into a continuous scene, we\r\nundertake a task resembling in its perplexity that of gathering up\r\nand piecing together the fragments ora letter which has been torn and\r\nscattered to the winds. Many words of deep significance, many entire\r\nsentences, and those possibly the most important ones, have flown\r\ntoo far on the winged breeze to be recovered. If we insert our own\r\nconjectural amendments, we perhaps give a purport utterly at variance\r\nwith the true one. Yet unless we attempt something in this way,\r\nthere must remain an unsightly gap, and a lack of continuousness\r\nand dependence in our narrative; so that it would arrive at certain\r\ninevitable catastrophes without due warning of their imminence.\r\n\r\nOf so much we are sure, that there seemed to be a sadly mysterious\r\nfascination in the influence of this ill-omened person over Miriam;\r\nit was such as beasts and reptiles of subtle and evil nature sometimes\r\nexercise upon their victims. Marvellous it was to see the hopelessness\r\nwith which being naturally of so courageous a spirit she resigned\r\nherself to the thraldom in which he held her. That iron chain, of which\r\nsome of the massive links were round her feminine waist, and the others\r\nin his ruthless hand,--or which, perhaps, bound the pair together by\r\na bond equally torturing to each,--must have been forged in some such\r\nunhallowed furnace as is only kindled by evil passions, and fed by evil\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nYet, let us trust, there may have been no crime in Miriam, but only\r\none of those fatalities which are among the most insoluble riddles\r\npropounded to mortal comprehension; the fatal decree by which every\r\ncrime is made to be the agony of many innocent persons, as well as of\r\nthe single guilty one.\r\n\r\nIt was, at any rate, but a feeble and despairing kind of remonstrance\r\nwhich she had now the energy to oppose against his persecution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou follow me too closely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in low, faltering accents; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nallow me too scanty room to draw my breath. Do you know what will be the\r\nend of this?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI know well what must be the end,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I may compare your foreboding with\r\nmy own. Mine is a very dark one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be but one result, and that soon,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the model. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmust throw off your present mask and assume another. You must vanish out\r\nof the scene: quit Rome with me, and leave no trace whereby to follow\r\nyou. It is in my power, as you well know, to compel your acquiescence in\r\nmy bidding. You are aware of the penalty of a refusal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that penalty with which you would terrify me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9canother there may be, but not so grievous.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath! simply death!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\npersecutor, \xe2\x80\x9cis not so simple and opportune a thing as you imagine. You\r\nare strong and warm with life. Sensitive and irritable as your spirit\r\nis, these many months of trouble, this latter thraldom in which I hold\r\nyou, have scarcely made your cheek paler than I saw it in your girlhood.\r\nMiriam,--for I forbear to speak another name, at which these leaves\r\nwould shiver above our heads,--Miriam, you cannot die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight not a dagger find my heart?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, for the first time meeting\r\nhis eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWould not poison make an end of me? Will not the Tiber drown\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I allow that you are mortal. But, Miriam,\r\nbelieve me, it is not your fate to die while there remains so much to be\r\nsinned and suffered in the world. We have a destiny which we must needs\r\nfulfil together. I, too, have struggled to escape it. I was as anxious\r\nas yourself to break the tie between us,--to bury the past in a\r\nfathomless grave,--to make it impossible that we should ever meet, until\r\nyou confront me at the bar of Judgment! You little can imagine what\r\nsteps I took to render all this secure; and what was the result?\r\nOur strange interview in the bowels of the earth convinced me of the\r\nfutility of my design.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, fatal chance!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miriam, covering her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your heart trembled with horror when you recognized me,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nhe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you did not guess that there was an equal horror in my own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy would not the weight of earth above our heads have crumbled down\r\nupon us both, forcing us apart, but burying us equally?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miriam,\r\nin a burst of vehement passion. \xe2\x80\x9cO, that we could have wandered in those\r\ndismal passages till we both perished, taking opposite paths in the\r\ndarkness, so that when we lay down to die, our last breaths might not\r\nmingle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were vain to wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the model. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all that labyrinth of\r\nmidnight paths, we should have found one another out to live or die\r\ntogether. Our fates cross and are entangled. The threads are twisted\r\ninto a strong cord, which is dragging us to an evil doom. Could the\r\nknots be severed, we might escape. But neither can your slender fingers\r\nuntie these knots, nor my masculine force break them. We must submit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray for rescue, as I have,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cPray for deliverance\r\nfrom me, since I am your evil genius, as you mine. Dark as your life has\r\nbeen, I have known you to pray in times past!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words of Miriam, a tremor and horror appeared to seize upon her\r\npersecutor, insomuch that he shook and grew ashy pale before her eyes.\r\nIn this man\xe2\x80\x99s memory there was something that made it awful for him to\r\nthink of prayer; nor would any torture be more intolerable than to be\r\nreminded of such divine comfort and succor as await pious souls\r\nmerely for the asking; This torment was perhaps the token of a native\r\ntemperament deeply susceptible of religious impressions, but which had\r\nbeen wronged, violated, and debased, until, at length, it was capable\r\nonly of terror from the sources that were intended for our purest and\r\nloftiest consolation. He looked so fearfully at her, and with such\r\nintense pain struggling in his eyes, that Miriam felt pity.\r\n\r\nAnd now, all at once, it struck her that he might be mad. It was an idea\r\nthat had never before seriously occurred to her mind, although, as soon\r\nas suggested, it fitted marvellously into many circumstances that\r\nlay within her knowledge. But, alas! such was her evil fortune, that,\r\nwhether mad or no, his power over her remained the same, and was likely\r\nto be used only the more tyrannously, if exercised by a lunatic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not give you pain,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, soothingly; \xe2\x80\x9cyour faith allows you\r\nthe consolations of penance and absolution. Try what help there may be\r\nin these, and leave me to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think it, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are bound together, and can\r\nnever part again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it seem so impossible?\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink how I had escaped from all the past! I had made for myself a\r\nnew sphere, and found new friends, new occupations, new hopes and\r\nenjoyments. My heart, methinks, was almost as unburdened as if there had\r\nbeen no miserable life behind me. The human spirit does not perish of a\r\nsingle wound, nor exhaust itself in a single trial of life. Let us\r\nbut keep asunder, and all may go well for both.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe fancied ourselves\r\nforever sundered,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYet we met once, in the bowels of the\r\nearth; and, were we to part now, our fates would fling us together again\r\nin a desert, on a mountain-top, or in whatever spot seemed safest. You\r\nspeak in vain, therefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistake your own will for an iron necessity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cotherwise, you might have suffered me to glide past you like a ghost,\r\nwhen we met among those ghosts of ancient days. Even now you might bid\r\nme pass as freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with unmitigable will; \xe2\x80\x9cyour reappearance has\r\ndestroyed the work of years. You know the power that I have over you.\r\nObey my bidding; or, within a short time, it shall be exercised: nor\r\nwill I cease to haunt you till the moment comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam more calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI foresee the end, and have already\r\nwarned you of it. It will be death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own death, Miriam,--or mine?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking fixedly at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine me a murderess?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, shuddering; \xe2\x80\x9cyou, at least,\r\nhave no right to think me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined he, with a glance of dark meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cmen have said that\r\nthis white hand had once a crimson stain.\xe2\x80\x9d He took her hand as he spoke,\r\nand held it in his own, in spite of the repugnance, amounting to nothing\r\nshort of agony, with which she struggled to regain it. Holding it up\r\nto the fading light (for there was already dimness among the trees),\r\nhe appeared to examine it closely, as if to discover the imaginary\r\nblood-stain with which he taunted her. He smiled as he let it go. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nlooks very white,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have known hands as white, which all\r\nthe water in the ocean would not have washed clean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had no stain,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miriam bitterly, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil you grasped it in\r\nyour own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wind has blown away whatever else they may have spoken.\r\n\r\nThey went together towards the town, and, on their way, continued to\r\nmake reference, no doubt, to some strange and dreadful history of their\r\nformer life, belonging equally to this dark man and to the fair and\r\nyouthful woman whom he persecuted. In their words, or in the breath that\r\nuttered them, there seemed to be an odor of guilt, and a scent of blood.\r\nYet, how can we imagine that a stain of ensanguined crime should attach\r\nto Miriam! Or how, on the other hand, should spotless innocence be\r\nsubjected to a thraldom like that which she endured from the spectre,\r\nwhom she herself had evoked out of the darkness! Be this as it might,\r\nMiriam, we have reason to believe, still continued to beseech him,\r\nhumbly, passionately, wildly, only to go his way, and leave her free to\r\nfollow her own sad path.\r\n\r\nThus they strayed onward through the green wilderness of the Borghese\r\ngrounds, and soon came near the city wall, where, had Miriam raised her\r\neyes, she might have seen Hilda and the sculptor leaning on the parapet.\r\nBut she walked in a mist of trouble, and could distinguish little beyond\r\nits limits. As they came within public observation, her persecutor fell\r\nbehind, throwing off the imperious manner which he had assumed during\r\ntheir solitary interview. The Porta del Popolo swarmed with life. The\r\nmerry-makers, who had spent the feast-day outside the walls, were now\r\nthronging in; a party of horsemen were entering beneath the arch; a\r\ntravelling carriage had been drawn up just within the verge, and was\r\npassing through the villainous ordeal of the papal custom-house. In the\r\nbroad piazza, too, there was a motley crowd.\r\n\r\nBut the stream of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s trouble kept its way through this flood of\r\nhuman life, and neither mingled with it nor was turned aside. With a sad\r\nkind of feminine ingenuity, she found a way to kneel before her tyrant\r\nundetected, though in full sight of all the people, still beseeching him\r\nfor freedom, and in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nA STROLL ON THE PINCIAN\r\n\r\n\r\nHilda, after giving the last touches to the picture of Beatrice Cenci,\r\nhad flown down from her dove-cote, late in the afternoon, and gone to\r\nthe Pincian Hill, in the hope of hearing a strain or two of exhilarating\r\nmusic. There, as it happened, she met the sculptor, for, to say the\r\ntruth, Kenyon had well noted the fair artist\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary way of life,\r\nand was accustomed to shape his own movements so as to bring him often\r\nwithin her sphere.\r\n\r\nThe Pincian Hill is the favorite promenade of the Roman aristocracy. At\r\nthe present day, however, like most other Roman possessions, it belongs\r\nless to the native inhabitants than to the barbarians from Gaul, Great\r\nBritain, anti beyond the sea, who have established a peaceful usurpation\r\nover whatever is enjoyable or memorable in the Eternal City. These\r\nforeign guests are indeed ungrateful, if they do not breathe a prayer\r\nfor Pope Clement, or whatever Holy Father it may have been, who levelled\r\nthe summit of the mount so skilfully, and bounded it with the parapet of\r\nthe city wall; who laid out those broad walks and drives, and overhung\r\nthem with the deepening shade of many kinds of tree; who scattered the\r\nflowers, of all seasons and of every clime, abundantly over those green,\r\ncentral lawns; who scooped out hollows in fit places, and, setting great\r\nbasins of marble in them, caused ever-gushing fountains to fill them to\r\nthe brim; who reared up the immemorial obelisk out of the soil that had\r\nlong hidden it; who placed pedestals along the borders of the avenues,\r\nand crowned them with busts of that multitude of worthies--statesmen,\r\nheroes, artists, men of letters and of song--whom the whole world claims\r\nas its chief ornaments, though Italy produced them all. In a word, the\r\nPincian garden is one of the things that reconcile the stranger (since\r\nhe fully appreciates the enjoyment, and feels nothing of the cost) to\r\nthe rule of an irresponsible dynasty of Holy Fathers, who seem to have\r\naimed at making life as agreeable an affair as it can well be.\r\n\r\nIn this pleasant spot, the red-trousered French soldiers are always to\r\nbe seen; bearded and grizzled veterans, perhaps with medals of Algiers\r\nor the Crimea on their breasts. To them is assigned the peaceful duty of\r\nseeing that children do not trample on the flower beds, nor any youthful\r\nlover rifle them of their fragrant blossoms to stick in the beloved\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Here sits (drooping upon some marble bench, in the\r\ntreacherous sunshine) the consumptive girl, whose friends have brought\r\nher, for cure, to a climate that instils poison into its very purest\r\nbreath. Here, all day, come nursery-maids, burdened with rosy English\r\nbabies, or guiding the footsteps of little travellers from the far\r\nWestern world. Here, in the sunny afternoons, roll and rumble all kinds\r\nof equipages, from the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s old-fashioned and gorgeous purple\r\ncarriage to the gay barouche of modern date. Here horsemen gallop on\r\nthoroughbred steeds. Here, in short, all the transitory population of\r\nRome, the world\xe2\x80\x99s great watering-place, rides, drives, or promenades!\r\nHere are beautiful sunsets; and here, whichever way you turn your eyes,\r\nare scenes as well worth gazing at, both in themselves and for their\r\nhistoric interest, as any that the sun ever rose and set upon. Here,\r\ntoo, on certain afternoons of the week, a French military band flings\r\nout rich music over the poor old city, floating her with strains as loud\r\nas those of her own echoless triumphs.\r\n\r\nHilda and the sculptor (by the contrivance of the latter, who loved best\r\nto be alone with his young countrywoman) had wandered beyond the throng\r\nof promenaders, whom they left in a dense cluster around the music. They\r\nstrayed, indeed, to the farthest point of the Pincian Hill, and leaned\r\nover the parapet, looking down upon the Muro Torto, a massive fragment\r\nof the oldest Roman wall, which juts over, as if ready to tumble down\r\nby its own weight, yet seems still the most indestructible piece of work\r\nthat men\xe2\x80\x99s hands ever piled together. In the blue distance rose Soracte,\r\nand other heights, which have gleamed afar, to our imaginations, but\r\nlook scarcely real to our bodily eyes, because, being dreamed about so\r\nmuch, they have taken the aerial tints which belong only to a dream.\r\nThese, nevertheless, are the solid framework of hills that shut in Rome,\r\nand its wide surrounding Campagna,--no land of dreams, but the broadest\r\npage of history, crowded so full with memorable events that one\r\nobliterates another; as if Time had crossed and recrossed his own\r\nrecords till they grew illegible.\r\n\r\nBut, not to meddle with history,--with which our narrative is no\r\notherwise concerned, than that the very dust of Rome is historic, and\r\ninevitably settles on our page and mingles with our ink,--we will return\r\nto our two friends, who were still leaning over the wall. Beneath them\r\nlay the broad sweep of the Borghese grounds, covered with trees, amid\r\nwhich appeared the white gleam of pillars and statues, and the flash of\r\nan upspringing fountain, all to be overshadowed at a later period of the\r\nyear by the thicker growth of foliage.\r\n\r\nThe advance of vegetation, in this softer climate, is less abrupt than\r\nthe inhabitant of the cold North is accustomed to observe. Beginning\r\nearlier,--even in February,--Spring is not compelled to burst into\r\nSummer with such headlong haste; there is time to dwell upon each\r\nopening beauty, and to enjoy the budding leaf, the tender green, the\r\nsweet youth and freshness of the year; it gives us its maiden charm,\r\nbefore, settling into the married Summer, which, again, does not so soon\r\nsober itself into matronly Autumn. In our own country, the virgin Spring\r\nhastens to its bridal too abruptly. But here, after a month or two of\r\nkindly growth, the leaves of the young trees, which cover that portion\r\nof the Borghese grounds nearest the city wall, were still in their\r\ntender half-development.\r\n\r\nIn the remoter depths, among the old groves of ilex-trees, Hilda and\r\nKenyon heard the faint sound of music, laughter, and mingling voices. It\r\nwas probably the uproar--spreading even so far as the walls of Rome,\r\nand growing faded and melancholy in its passage--of that wild sylvan\r\nmerriment, which we have already attempted to describe. By and by it\r\nceased--although the two listeners still tried to distinguish it between\r\nthe bursts of nearer music from the military band. But there was no\r\nrenewal of that distant mirth. Soon afterwards they saw a solitary\r\nfigure advancing along one of the paths that lead from the obscurer part\r\nof the ground towards the gateway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! is it not Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe it is, beyond a doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how gravely he\r\nwalks, and with what long looks behind him! He seems either very weary,\r\nor very sad. I should not hesitate to call it sadness, if Donatello were\r\na creature capable of the sin and folly of low spirits. In all these\r\nhundred paces, while we have been watching him, he has not made one\r\nof those little caprioles in the air which are characteristic of his\r\nnatural gait. I begin to doubt whether he is a veritable Faun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, with perfect simplicity, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have thought him--and\r\ndo think him--one of that strange, wild, happy race of creatures, that\r\nused to laugh and sport in the woods, in the old, old times? So do\r\nI, indeed! But I never quite believed, till now, that fauns existed\r\nanywhere but in poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sculptor at first merely smiled. Then, as the idea took further\r\npossession of his mind, he laughed outright, and wished from the bottom\r\nof his heart (being in love with Hilda, though he had never told her\r\nso) that he could have rewarded or punished her for its pretty absurdity\r\nwith a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Hilda, what a treasure of sweet faith and pure imagination you hide\r\nunder that little straw hat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, at length. \xe2\x80\x9cA Faun! a Faun!\r\nGreat Pan is not dead, then, after all! The whole tribe of mythical\r\ncreatures yet live in the moonlit seclusion of a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s fancy,\r\nand find it a lovelier abode and play-place, I doubt not, than their\r\nArcadian haunts of yore. What bliss, if a man of marble, like myself,\r\ncould stray thither, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you laugh so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hilda, reddening; for she was a little\r\ndisturbed at Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s ridicule, however kindly expressed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I\r\nhave said, that you think so very foolish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not foolish, then,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the sculptor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut wiser, it may\r\nbe, than I can fathom. Really, however, the idea does strike one as\r\ndelightfully fresh, when we consider Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s position and external\r\nenvironment. Why, my dear Hilda, he is a Tuscan born, of an old noble\r\nrace in that part of Italy; and he has a moss-grown tower among the\r\nApennines, where he and his forefathers have dwelt, under their own\r\nvines and fig-trees, from an unknown antiquity. His boyish passion\r\nfor Miriam has introduced him familiarly to our little circle; and our\r\nrepublican and artistic simplicity of intercourse has included this\r\nyoung Italian, on the same terms as one of ourselves. But, if we\r\npaid due respect to rank and title, we should bend reverentially to\r\nDonatello, and salute him as his Excellency the Count di Monte Beni.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a droll idea, much droller than his being a Faun!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHilda, laughing in her turn. \xe2\x80\x9cThis does not quite satisfy me, however,\r\nespecially as you yourself recognized and acknowledged his wonderful\r\nresemblance to the statue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcept as regards the pointed ears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon; adding, aside, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\none other little peculiarity, generally observable in the statues of\r\nfauns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for his Excellency the Count di Monte Beni\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda,\r\nsmiling again at the dignity with which this title invested their\r\nplayful friend, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know we could never see their shape, on account of\r\nhis clustering curls. Nay, I remember, he once started back, as shyly as\r\na wild deer, when Miriam made a pretence of examining them. How do you\r\nexplain that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I certainly shall not contend against such a weight of evidence,\r\nthe fact of his faunship being otherwise so probable,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nsculptor, still hardly retaining his gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cFaun or not, Donatello or\r\nthe Count di Monte Beni--is a singularly wild creature, and, as I have\r\nremarked on other occasions, though very gentle, does not love to be\r\ntouched. Speaking in no harsh sense, there is a great deal of animal\r\nnature in him, as if he had been born in the woods, and had run wild all\r\nhis childhood, and were as yet but imperfectly domesticated. Life, even\r\nin our day, is very simple and unsophisticated in some of the shaggy\r\nnooks of the Apennines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt annoys me very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, \xe2\x80\x9cthis inclination, which\r\nmost people have, to explain away the wonder and the mystery out\r\nof everything. Why could not you allow me--and yourself, too--the\r\nsatisfaction of thinking him a Faun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray keep your belief, dear Hilda, if it makes you any happier,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe sculptor; \xe2\x80\x9cand I shall do my best to become a convert. Donatello has\r\nasked me to spend the summer with him, in his ancestral tower, where\r\nI purpose investigating the pedigree of these sylvan counts, his\r\nforefathers; and if their shadows beckon me into dreamland, I shall\r\nwillingly follow. By the bye, speaking of Donatello, there is a point on\r\nwhich I should like to be enlightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, in answer to his look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there the slightest chance of his winning Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s affections?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested Kenyon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiriam! she, so accomplished and gifted!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hilda; \xe2\x80\x9cand he, a\r\nrude, uncultivated boy! No, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would seem impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, on the other hand,\r\na gifted woman flings away her affections so unaccountably, sometimes!\r\nMiriam of late has been very morbid and miserable, as we both know.\r\nYoung as she is, the morning light seems already to have faded out of\r\nher life; and now comes Donatello, with natural sunshine enough for\r\nhimself and her, and offers her the opportunity of making her heart and\r\nlife all new and cheery again. People of high intellectual endowments do\r\nnot require similar ones in those they love. They are just the persons\r\nto appreciate the wholesome gush of natural feeling, the honest\r\naffection, the simple joy, the fulness of contentment with what\r\nhe loves, which Miriam sees in Donatello. True; she may call him a\r\nsimpleton. It is a necessity of the case; for a man loses the capacity\r\nfor this kind of affection, in proportion as he cultivates and refines\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, drawing imperceptibly away from her companion.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the penalty of refinement? Pardon me; I do not believe it.\r\nIt is because you are a sculptor, that you think nothing can be finely\r\nwrought except it be cold and hard, like the marble in which your ideas\r\ntake shape. I am a painter, and know that the most delicate beauty may\r\nbe softened and warmed throughout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said a foolish thing, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt surprises\r\nme, for I might have drawn a wiser knowledge out of my own experience.\r\nIt is the surest test of genuine love, that it brings back our early\r\nsimplicity to the worldliest of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus talking, they loitered slowly along beside the parapet which\r\nborders the level summit of the Pincian with its irregular sweep. At\r\nintervals they looked through the lattice-work of their thoughts at the\r\nvaried prospects that lay before and beneath them.\r\n\r\nFrom the terrace where they now stood there is an abrupt descent towards\r\nthe Piazza del Popolo; and looking down into its broad space they\r\nbeheld the tall palatial edifices, the church domes, and the ornamented\r\ngateway, which grew and were consolidated out of the thought of Michael\r\nAngelo. They saw, too, the red granite obelisk, oldest of things,\r\neven in Rome, which rises in the centre of the piazza, with a fourfold\r\nfountain at its base. All Roman works and ruins (whether of the\r\nempire, the far-off republic, or the still more distant kings) assume a\r\ntransient, visionary, and impalpable character when we think that this\r\nindestructible monument supplied one of the recollections which Moses\r\nand the Israelites bore from Egypt into the desert. Perchance, on\r\nbeholding the cloudy pillar and the fiery column, they whispered\r\nawestricken to one another, \xe2\x80\x9cIn its shape it is like that old obelisk\r\nwhich we and our fathers have so often seen on the borders of the Nile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And now that very obelisk, with hardly a trace of decay upon it, is the\r\nfirst thing that the modern traveller sees after entering the Flaminian\r\nGate!\r\n\r\nLifting their eyes, Hilda and her companion gazed westward, and saw\r\nbeyond the invisible Tiber the Castle of St. Angelo; that immense tomb\r\nof a pagan emperor, with the archangel at its summit.\r\n\r\nStill farther off appeared a mighty pile of buildings, surmounted by the\r\nvast dome, which all of us have shaped and swelled outward, like a huge\r\nbubble, to the utmost Scope of our imaginations, long before we see it\r\nfloating over the worship of the city. It may be most worthily seen\r\nfrom precisely the point where our two friends were now standing. At\r\nany nearer view the grandeur of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s hides itself behind the\r\nimmensity of its separate parts,--so that we see only the front, only\r\nthe sides, only the pillared length and loftiness of the portico, and\r\nnot the mighty whole. But at this distance the entire outline of the\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s cathedral, as well as that of the palace of the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchief priest, is taken in at once. In such remoteness, moreover, the\r\nimagination is not debarred from lending its assistance, even while\r\nwe have the reality before our eyes, and helping the weakness of human\r\nsense to do justice to so grand an object. It requires both faith and\r\nfancy to enable us to feel, what is nevertheless so true, that yonder,\r\nin front of the purple outline of hills, is the grandest edifice ever\r\nbuilt by man, painted against God\xe2\x80\x99s loveliest sky.\r\n\r\nAfter contemplating a little while a scene which their long residence in\r\nRome had made familiar to them, Kenyon and Hilda again let their glances\r\nfall into the piazza at their feet. They there beheld Miriam, who had\r\njust entered the Porta del Popolo, and was standing by the obelisk and\r\nfountain. With a gesture that impressed Kenyon as at once suppliant and\r\nimperious, she seemed to intimate to a figure which had attended her\r\nthus far, that it was now her desire to be left alone. The pertinacious\r\nmodel, however, remained immovable.\r\n\r\nAnd the sculptor here noted a circumstance, which, according to the\r\ninterpretation he might put upon it, was either too trivial to be\r\nmentioned, or else so mysteriously significant that he found it\r\ndifficult to believe his eyes. Miriam knelt down on the steps of the\r\nfountain; so far there could be no question of the fact. To other\r\nobservers, if any there were, she probably appeared to take this\r\nattitude merely for the convenience of dipping her fingers into the gush\r\nof water from the mouth of one of the stone lions. But as she clasped\r\nher hands together after thus bathing them, and glanced upward at the\r\nmodel, an idea took strong possession of Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s mind that Miriam was\r\nkneeling to this dark follower there in the world\xe2\x80\x99s face!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Hilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she, surprised at the emotion of his tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nMiriam, who has just bathed her hands in that delightfully cool water. I\r\noften dip my fingers into a Roman fountain, and think of the brook that\r\nused to be one of my playmates in my New England village.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancied I saw something else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was doubtless a\r\nmistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, allowing that he had caught a true glimpse into the hidden\r\nsignificance of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s gesture, what a terrible thraldom did it\r\nsuggest! Free as she seemed to be,--beggar as he looked,--the nameless\r\nvagrant must then be dragging the beautiful Miriam through the streets\r\nof Rome, fettered and shackled more cruelly than any captive queen of\r\nyore following in an emperor\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. And was it conceivable that\r\nshe would have been thus enthralled unless some great error--how great\r\nKenyon dared not think--or some fatal weakness had given this dark\r\nadversary a vantage ground?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHilda,\xe2\x80\x9d said he abruptly, \xe2\x80\x9cwho and what is Miriam? Pardon me; but are\r\nyou sure of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure of her!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Hilda, with an angry blush, for her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure that she is kind, good, and generous; a true and\r\nfaithful friend, whom I love dearly, and who loves me as well! What more\r\nthan this need I be sure of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your delicate instincts say all this in her favor?--nothing against\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the sculptor, without heeding the irritation of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are my own impressions, too. But she is such a mystery!\r\nWe do not even know whether she is a countrywoman of ours, or an\r\nEnglishwoman, or a German. There is Anglo-Saxon blood in her veins, one\r\nwould say, and a right English accent on her tongue, but much that is\r\nnot English breeding, nor American. Nowhere else but in Rome, and as an\r\nartist, could she hold a place in society without giving some clew to\r\nher past life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love her dearly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, still with displeasure in her tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand trust her most entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart trusts her at least, whatever my head may do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kenyon;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand Rome is not like one of our New England villages, where we need the\r\npermission of each individual neighbor for every act that we do, every\r\nword that we utter, and every friend that we make or keep. In these\r\nparticulars the papal despotism allows us freer breath than our native\r\nair; and if we like to take generous views of our associates, we can do\r\nso, to a reasonable extent, without ruining ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe music has ceased,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda; \xe2\x80\x9cI am going now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are three streets that, beginning close beside each other, diverge\r\nfrom the Piazza del Popolo towards the heart of Rome: on the left, the\r\nVia del Babuino; on the right, the Via della Ripetta; and between these\r\ntwo that world-famous avenue, the Corso. It appeared that Miriam and her\r\nstrange companion were passing up the first mentioned of these three,\r\nand were soon hidden from Hilda and the sculptor.\r\n\r\nThe two latter left the Pincian by the broad and stately walk that\r\nskirts along its brow. Beneath them, from the base of the abrupt\r\ndescent, the city spread wide away in a close contiguity of red-earthen\r\nroofs, above which rose eminent the domes of a hundred churches, beside\r\nhere and there a tower, and the upper windows of some taller or higher\r\nsituated palace, looking down on a multitude of palatial abodes. At a\r\ndistance, ascending out of the central mass of edifices, they could see\r\nthe top of the Antonine column, and near it the circular roof of the\r\nPantheon looking heavenward with its ever-open eye.\r\n\r\nExcept these two objects, almost everything that they beheld was\r\nmediaeval, though built, indeed, of the massive old stones and\r\nindestructible bricks of imperial Rome; for the ruins of the Coliseum,\r\nthe Golden House, and innumerable temples of Roman gods, and mansions of\r\nCaesars and senators, had supplied the material for all those gigantic\r\nhovels, and their walls were cemented with mortar of inestimable cost,\r\nbeing made of precious antique statues, burnt long ago for this petty\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nRome, as it now exists, has grown up under the Popes, and seems like\r\nnothing but a heap of broken rubbish, thrown into the great chasm\r\nbetween our own days and the Empire, merely to fill it up; and, for the\r\nbetter part of two thousand years, its annals of obscure policies,\r\nand wars, and continually recurring misfortunes, seem also but broken\r\nrubbish, as compared with its classic history.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the present city as at all connected with the famous one\r\nof old, it is only because we find it built over its grave. A depth of\r\nthirty feet of soil has covered up the Rome of ancient days, so that it\r\nlies like the dead corpse of a giant, decaying for centuries, with no\r\nsurvivor mighty enough even to bury it, until the dust of all those\r\nyears has gathered slowly over its recumbent form and made a casual\r\nsepulchre.\r\n\r\nWe know not how to characterize, in any accordant and compatible\r\nterms, the Rome that lies before us; its sunless alleys, and streets\r\nof palaces; its churches, lined with the gorgeous marbles that were\r\noriginally polished for the adornment of pagan temples; its thousands of\r\nevil smells, mixed up with fragrance of rich incense, diffused from as\r\nmany censers; its little life, deriving feeble nutriment from what\r\nhas long been dead. Everywhere, some fragment of ruin suggesting the\r\nmagnificence of a former epoch; everywhere, moreover, a Cross,--and\r\nnastiness at the foot of it. As the sum of all, there are recollections\r\nthat kindle the soul, and a gloom and languor that depress it beyond any\r\ndepth of melancholic sentiment that can be elsewhere known.\r\n\r\nYet how is it possible to say an unkind or irreverential word of Rome?\r\nThe city of all time, and of all the world! The spot for which man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat life and deeds have done so much, and for which decay has done\r\nwhatever glory and dominion could not do! At this moment, the evening\r\nsunshine is flinging its golden mantle over it, making all that we\r\nthought mean magnificent; the bells of all the churches suddenly ring\r\nout, as if it were a peal of triumph because Rome is still imperial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, on whose susceptibility the scene\r\nalways made a strong impression, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Rome--mere Rome--will crowd\r\neverything else out of my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the sculptor. They had now reached the grand\r\nstairs that ascend from the Piazza di Spagna to the hither brow of the\r\nPincian Hill. Old Beppo, the millionnaire of his ragged fraternity,\r\nit is a wonder that no artist paints him as the cripple whom St. Peter\r\nheals at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple,--was just mounting his donkey\r\nto depart, laden with the rich spoil of the day\xe2\x80\x99s beggary.\r\n\r\nUp the stairs, drawing his tattered cloak about his face, came the\r\nmodel, at whom Beppo looked askance, jealous of an encroacher on his\r\nrightful domain. The figure passed away, however, up the Via Sistina. In\r\nthe piazza below, near the foot of the magnificent steps, stood Miriam,\r\nwith her eyes bent on the ground, as if she were counting those\r\nlittle, square, uncomfortable paving-stones, that make it a penitential\r\npilgrimage to walk in Rome. She kept this attitude for several minutes,\r\nand when, at last, the importunities of a beggar disturbed her from it,\r\nshe seemed bewildered and pressed her hand upon her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been in some sad dream or other, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon\r\nsympathizingly; \xe2\x80\x9cand even now she is imprisoned there in a kind of cage,\r\nthe iron bars of which are made of her own thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear she is not well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going down the stairs, and\r\nwill join Miriam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Hilda, this is a perplexed\r\nand troubled world! It soothes me inexpressibly to think of you in your\r\ntower, with white doves and white thoughts for your companions, so high\r\nabove us all, and With the Virgin for your household friend. You know\r\nnot how far it throws its light, that lamp which you keep burning at her\r\nshrine! I passed beneath the tower last night, and the ray cheered me,\r\nbecause you lighted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has for me a religious significance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyet I am no Catholic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey parted, and Kenyon made haste along the Via Sistina, in the hope\r\nof overtaking the model, whose haunts and character he was anxious to\r\ninvestigate, for Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s sake. He fancied that he saw him a long way\r\nin advance, but before he reached the Fountain of the Triton the dusky\r\nfigure had vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nA SCULPTOR\xe2\x80\x99S STUDIO\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this period, Miriam seems to have been goaded by a weary\r\nrestlessness that drove her abroad on any errand or none. She went one\r\nmorning to visit Kenyon in his studio, whither he had invited her to\r\nsee a new statue, on which he had staked many hopes, and which was now\r\nalmost completed in the clay. Next to Hilda, the person for whom\r\nMiriam felt most affection and confidence was Kenyon; and in all the\r\ndifficulties that beset her life, it was her impulse to draw near Hilda\r\nfor feminine sympathy, and the sculptor for brotherly counsel.\r\n\r\nYet it was to little purpose that she approached the edge of the\r\nvoiceless gulf between herself and them. Standing on the utmost verge of\r\nthat dark chasm, she might stretch out her hand, and never clasp a hand\r\nof theirs; she might strive to call out, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, friends! help!\xe2\x80\x9d but, as\r\nwith dreamers when they shout, her voice would perish inaudibly in\r\nthe remoteness that seemed such a little way. This perception of an\r\ninfinite, shivering solitude, amid which we cannot come close enough to\r\nhuman beings to be warmed by them, and where they turn to cold, chilly\r\nshapes of mist, is one of the most forlorn results of any accident,\r\nmisfortune, crime, or peculiarity of character, that puts an individual\r\najar with the world. Very often, as in Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s case, there is an\r\ninsatiable instinct that demands friendship, love, and intimate\r\ncommunion, but is forced to pine in empty forms; a hunger of the heart,\r\nwhich finds only shadows to feed upon.\r\n\r\nKenyon\xe2\x80\x99s studio was in a cross-street, or, rather, an ugly and dirty\r\nlittle lane, between the Corso and the Via della Ripetta; and though\r\nchill, narrow, gloomy, and bordered with tall and shabby structures,\r\nthe lane was not a whit more disagreeable than nine tenths of the Roman\r\nstreets. Over the door of one of the houses was a marble tablet, bearing\r\nan inscription, to the purport that the sculpture-rooms within had\r\nformerly been occupied by the illustrious artist Canova. In these\r\nprecincts (which Canova\xe2\x80\x99s genius was not quite of a character to render\r\nsacred, though it certainly made them interesting) the young American\r\nsculptor had now established himself.\r\n\r\nThe studio of a sculptor is generally but a rough and dreary-looking\r\nplace, with a good deal the aspect, indeed, of a stone-mason\xe2\x80\x99s workshop.\r\nBare floors of brick or plank, and plastered walls,--an old chair\r\nor two, or perhaps only a block of marble (containing, however, the\r\npossibility of ideal grace within it) to sit down upon; some hastily\r\nscrawled sketches of nude figures on the whitewash of the wall. These\r\nlast are probably the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s earliest glimpses of ideas that may\r\nhereafter be solidified into imperishable stone, or perhaps may remain\r\nas impalpable as a dream. Next there are a few very roughly modelled\r\nlittle figures in clay or plaster, exhibiting the second stage of the\r\nidea as it advances towards a marble immortality; and then is seen the\r\nexquisitely designed shape of clay, more interesting than even the\r\nfinal marble, as being the intimate production of the sculptor himself,\r\nmoulded throughout with his loving hands, and nearest to his imagination\r\nand heart. In the plaster-cast, from this clay model, the beauty of\r\nthe statue strangely disappears, to shine forth again with pure white\r\nradiance, in the precious marble of Carrara. Works in all these stages\r\nof advancement, and some with the final touch upon them, might be found\r\nin Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s studio.\r\n\r\nHere might be witnessed the process of actually chiselling the marble,\r\nwith which (as it is not quite satisfactory to think) a sculptor in\r\nthese days has very little to do. In Italy, there is a class of men\r\nwhose merely mechanical skill is perhaps more exquisite than was\r\npossessed by the ancient artificers, who wrought out the designs of\r\nPraxiteles; or, very possibly, by Praxiteles himself. Whatever of\r\nillusive representation can be effected in marble, they are capable of\r\nachieving, if the object be before their eyes. The sculptor has but to\r\npresent these men with a plaster-cast of his design, and a sufficient\r\nblock of marble, and tell them that the figure is imbedded in the stone,\r\nand must be freed from its encumbering superfluities; and, in due time,\r\nwithout the necessity of his touching the work with his own finger,\r\nhe will see before him the statue that is to make him renowned. His\r\ncreative power has wrought it with a word.\r\n\r\nIn no other art, surely, does genius find such effective instruments,\r\nand so happily relieve itself of the drudgery, of actual performance;\r\ndoing wonderfully nice things by the hands of other people, when it may\r\nbe suspected they could not always be done by the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s own. And\r\nhow much of the admiration which our artists get for their buttons\r\nand buttonholes, their shoe-ties, their neckcloths,--and these, at our\r\npresent epoch of taste, make a large share of the renown,--would be\r\nabated, if we were generally aware that the sculptor can claim no credit\r\nfor such pretty performances, as immortalized in marble! They are not\r\nhis work, but that of some nameless machine in human shape.\r\n\r\nMiriam stopped an instant in an antechamber, to look at a half-finished\r\nbust, the features of which seemed to be struggling out of the stone;\r\nand, as it were, scattering and dissolving its hard substance by the\r\nglow of feeling and intelligence. As the skilful workman gave stroke\r\nafter stroke of the chisel with apparent carelessness, but sure effect,\r\nit was impossible not to think that the outer marble was merely an\r\nextraneous environment; the human countenance within its embrace must\r\nhave existed there since the limestone ledges of Carrara were first\r\nmade. Another bust was nearly completed, though still one of Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmost trustworthy assistants was at work, giving delicate touches,\r\nshaving off an impalpable something, and leaving little heaps of marble\r\ndust to attest it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs these busts in the block of marble,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cso does our\r\nindividual fate exist in the limestone of time. We fancy that we carve\r\nit out; but its ultimate shape is prior to all our action.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKenyon was in the inner room, but, hearing a step in the antechamber, he\r\nthrew a veil over what he was at work upon, and came out to receive his\r\nvisitor. He was dressed in a gray blouse, with a little cap on the top\r\nof his head; a costume which became him better than the formal garments\r\nwhich he wore whenever he passed out of his own domains. The sculptor\r\nhad a face which, when time had done a little more for it, would offer a\r\nworthy subject for as good an artist as himself: features finely cut, as\r\nif already marble; an ideal forehead, deeply set eyes, and a mouth much\r\nhidden in a light-brown beard, but apparently sensitive and delicate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not offer you my hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit is grimy with Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I will not touch clay; it is earthy and human,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to try whether there is any calm and coolness among\r\nyour marbles. My own art is too nervous, too passionate, too full of\r\nagitation, for me to work at it whole days together, without intervals\r\nof repose. So, what have you to show me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray look at everything here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cI love to have painters\r\nsee my work. Their judgment is unprejudiced, and more valuable than that\r\nof the world generally, from the light which their own art throws on\r\nmine. More valuable, too, than that of my brother sculptors, who never\r\njudge me fairly,--nor I them, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo gratify him, Miriam looked round at the specimens in marble or\r\nplaster, of which there were several in the room, comprising originals\r\nor casts of most of the designs that Kenyon had thus far produced. He\r\nwas still too young to have accumulated a large gallery of such things.\r\nWhat he had to show were chiefly the attempts and experiments, in\r\nvarious directions, of a beginner in art, acting as a stern tutor to\r\nhimself, and profiting more by his failures than by any successes of\r\nwhich he was yet capable. Some of them, however, had great merit; and\r\nin the pure, fine glow of the new marble, it may be, they dazzled the\r\njudgment into awarding them higher praise than they deserved. Miriam\r\nadmired the statue of a beautiful youth, a pearlfisher; who had got\r\nentangled in the weeds at the bottom of the sea, and lay dead among the\r\npearl-oysters, the rich shells, and the seaweeds, all of like value to\r\nhim now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor young man has perished among the prizes that he sought,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n remarked she. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what a strange efficacy there is in death! If we\r\ncannot all win pearls, it causes an empty shell to satisfy us just as\r\nwell. I like this statue, though it is too cold and stern in its moral\r\nlesson; and, physically, the form has not settled itself into sufficient\r\nrepose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another style, there was a grand, calm head of Milton, not copied\r\nfrom any one bust or picture, yet more authentic than any of them,\r\nbecause all known representations of the poet had been profoundly\r\nstudied, and solved in the artist\xe2\x80\x99s mind. The bust over the tomb in\r\nGrey Friars Church, the original miniatures and pictures, wherever to\r\nbe found, had mingled each its special truth in this one work; wherein,\r\nlikewise, by long perusal and deep love of the Paradise Lost, the Comus,\r\nthe Lycidas, and L\xe2\x80\x99Allegro, the sculptor had succeeded, even better than\r\nhe knew, in spiritualizing his marble with the poet\xe2\x80\x99s mighty genius. And\r\nthis was a great thing to have achieved, such a length of time after the\r\ndry bones and dust of Milton were like those of any other dead man.\r\n\r\nThere were also several portrait-busts, comprising those of two or three\r\nof the illustrious men of our own country, whom Kenyon, before he left\r\nAmerica, had asked permission to model. He had done so, because he\r\nsincerely believed that, whether he wrought the busts in marble or\r\nbronze, the one would corrode and the other crumble in the long lapse\r\nof time, beneath these great men\xe2\x80\x99s immortality. Possibly, however, the\r\nyoung artist may have underestimated the durability of his material.\r\nOther faces there were, too, of men who (if the brevity of their\r\nremembrance, after death, can be augured from their little value in\r\nlife) should have been represented in snow rather than marble. Posterity\r\nwill be puzzled what to do with busts like these, the concretions and\r\npetrifactions of a vain self-estimate; but will find, no doubt, that they\r\nserve to build into stone walls, or burn into quicklime, as well as if\r\nthe marble had never been blocked into the guise of human heads.\r\n\r\nBut it is an awful thing, indeed, this endless endurance, this almost\r\nindestructibility, of a marble bust! Whether in our own case, or that of\r\nother men, it bids us sadly measure the little, little time during which\r\nour lineaments are likely to be of interest to any human being. It\r\nis especially singular that Americans should care about perpetuating\r\nthemselves in this mode. The brief duration of our families, as\r\na hereditary household, renders it next to a certainty that the\r\ngreat-grandchildren will not know their father\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, and that\r\nhalf a century hence at furthest, the hammer of the auctioneer will\r\nthump its knock-down blow against his blockhead, sold at so much for the\r\npound of stone! And it ought to make us shiver, the idea of leaving\r\nour features to be a dusty-white ghost among strangers of another\r\ngeneration, who will take our nose between their thumb and fingers (as\r\nwe have seen men do by Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s), and infallibly break it off if they\r\ncan do so without detection!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, who had been revolving some such thoughts as the\r\nabove, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a good state of mind for mortal man, when he is content to\r\nleave no more definite memorial than the grass, which will sprout kindly\r\nand speedily over his grave, if we do not make the spot barren with\r\nmarble. Methinks, too, it will be a fresher and better world, when it\r\nflings off this great burden of stony memories, which the ages have\r\ndeemed it a piety to heap upon its back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Kenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cgoes against my whole art. Sculpture,\r\nand the delight which men naturally take in it, appear to me a proof\r\nthat it is good to work with all time before our view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cI must not quarrel with you for flinging\r\nyour heavy stones at poor Posterity; and, to say the truth, I think you\r\nare as likely to hit the mark as anybody. These busts, now, much as I\r\nseem to scorn them, make me feel as if you were a magician.. You turn\r\nfeverish men into cool, quiet marble. What a blessed change for them!\r\nWould you could do as much for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, gladly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kenyon, who had long wished to model that beautiful\r\nand most expressive face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will you begin to sit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoh! that was not what I meant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, show me something\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recognize this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sculptor.\r\n\r\nHe took out of his desk a little old-fashioned ivory coffer, yellow\r\nwith age; it was richly carved with antique figures and foliage; and had\r\nKenyon thought fit to say that Benvenuto Cellini wrought this precious\r\nbox, the skill and elaborate fancy of the work would by no means have\r\ndiscredited his word, nor the old artist\xe2\x80\x99s fame. At least, it was\r\nevidently a production of Benvenuto\xe2\x80\x99s school and century, and might\r\nonce have been the jewel-case of some grand lady at the court of the De\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMedici.\r\n\r\nLifting the lid, however, no blaze of diamonds was disclosed, but\r\nonly, lapped in fleecy cotton, a small, beautifully shaped hand, most\r\ndelicately sculptured in marble. Such loving care and nicest art had\r\nbeen lavished here, that the palm really seemed to have a tenderness\r\nin its very substance. Touching those lovely fingers,--had the jealous\r\nsculptor allowed you to touch,--you could hardly believe that a virgin\r\nwarmth would not steal from them into your heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this is very beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam, with a genial smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as good in its way as Loulie\xe2\x80\x99s hand with its baby-dimples, which\r\nPowers showed me at Florence, evidently valuing it as much as if he\r\nhad wrought it out of a piece of his great heart. As good as Harriet\r\nHosmer\xe2\x80\x99s clasped hands of Browning and his wife, symbolizing the\r\nindividuality and heroic union of two high, poetic lives! Nay, I do not\r\nquestion that it is better than either of those, because you must\r\nhave wrought it passionately, in spite of its maiden palm and dainty\r\nfingertips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do recognize it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kenyon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one right hand on earth that could have supplied\r\nthe model,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cso small and slender, so perfectly\r\nsymmetrical, and yet with a character of delicate energy. I have watched\r\nit a hundred times at its work; but I did not dream that you had won\r\nHilda so far! How have you persuaded that shy maiden to let you take her\r\nhand in marble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! She never knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d hastily replied Kenyon, anxious to vindicate\r\nhis mistress\xe2\x80\x99s maidenly reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cI stole it from her. The hand is a\r\nreminiscence. After gazing at it so often, and even holding it once for\r\nan instant, when Hilda was not thinking of me, I should be a bungler\r\nindeed, if I could not now reproduce it to something like the life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay you win the original one day!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have little ground to hope it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sculptor despondingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHilda does not dwell in our mortal atmosphere; and gentle and soft as\r\nshe appears, it will be as difficult to win her heart as to entice down\r\na white bird from its sunny freedom in the sky. It is strange, with all\r\nher delicacy and fragility, the impression she makes of being utterly\r\nsufficient to herself. No; I shall never win her. She is abundantly\r\ncapable of sympathy, and delights to receive it, but she has no need of\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI partly agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a mistaken idea, which\r\nmen generally entertain, that nature has made women especially prone to\r\nthrow their whole being into what is technically called love. We have,\r\nto say the least, no more necessity for it than yourselves; only we have\r\nnothing else to do with our hearts. When women have other objects\r\nin life, they are not apt to fall in love. I can think of many women\r\ndistinguished in art, literature, and science,--and multitudes whose\r\nhearts and minds find good employment in less ostentatious ways,--who\r\nlead high, lonely lives, and are conscious of no sacrifice so far as\r\nyour sex is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Hilda will be one of these!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe thought makes\r\nme shiver for myself, and and for her, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps she may sprain the delicate wrist\r\nwhich you have sculptured to such perfection. In that case you may hope.\r\nThese old masters to whom she has vowed herself, and whom her slender\r\nhand and woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart serve so faithfully, are your only rivals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sculptor sighed as he put away the treasure of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s marble hand\r\ninto the ivory coffer, and thought how slight was the possibility\r\nthat he should ever feel responsive to his own the tender clasp of the\r\noriginal. He dared not even kiss the image that he himself had made: it\r\nhad assumed its share of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s remote and shy divinity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cshow me the new statue which you asked me\r\nhither to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEOPATRA\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy new statue!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, who had positively forgotten it in the\r\nthought of Hilda; \xe2\x80\x9chere it is, under this veil.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot a nude figure,\r\nI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery young sculptor seems to think that he\r\nmust give the world some specimen of indecorous womanhood, and call it\r\nEve, Venus, a Nymph, or any name that may apologize for a lack of\r\ndecent clothing. I am weary, even more than I am ashamed, of seeing such\r\nthings. Nowadays people are as good as born in their clothes, and\r\nthere is practically not a nude human being in existence. An artist,\r\ntherefore, as you must candidly confess, cannot sculpture nudity with a\r\npure heart, if only because he is compelled to steal guilty glimpses\r\nat hired models. The marble inevitably loses its chastity under such\r\ncircumstances. An old Greek sculptor, no doubt, found his models in the\r\nopen sunshine, and among pure and princely maidens, and thus the nude\r\nstatues of antiquity are as modest as violets, and sufficiently draped\r\nin their own beauty. But as for Mr. Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s colored Venuses (stained, I\r\nbelieve, with tobacco juice), and all other nudities of to-day, I really\r\ndo not understand what they have to say to this generation, and would be\r\nglad to see as many heaps of quicklime in their stead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are severe upon the professors of my art,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, half\r\nsmiling, half seriously; \xe2\x80\x9cnot that you are wholly wrong, either. We are\r\nbound to accept drapery of some kind, and make the best of it. But\r\nwhat are we to do? Must we adopt the costume of to-day, and carve, for\r\nexample, a Venus in a hoop-petticoat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a boulder, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nthe difficulty goes to confirm me in my belief that, except for\r\nportrait-busts, sculpture has no longer a right to claim any place among\r\nliving arts. It has wrought itself out, and come fairly to an end. There\r\nis never a new group nowadays; never even so much as a new attitude.\r\nGreenough (I take my examples among men of merit) imagined nothing new;\r\nnor Crawford either, except in the tailoring line. There are not, as you\r\nwill own, more than half a dozen positively original statues or groups\r\nin the world, and these few are of immemorial antiquity. A person\r\nfamiliar with the Vatican, the Uffizzi Gallery, the Naples Gallery,\r\nand the Louvre, will at once refer any modern production to its antique\r\nprototype; which, moreover, had begun to get out of fashion, even in old\r\nRoman days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray stop, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cor I shall fling away the chisel\r\nforever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFairly own to me, then, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam, whose disturbed\r\nmind found a certain relief in this declamation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you sculptors\r\nare, of necessity, the greatest plagiarists in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not own it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cyet cannot utterly contradict you, as\r\nregards the actual state of the art. But as long as the Carrara quarries\r\nstill yield pure blocks, and while my own country has marble mountains,\r\nprobably as fine in quality, I shall steadfastly believe that future\r\nsculptors will revive this noblest of the beautiful arts, and people the\r\nworld with new shapes of delicate grace and massive grandeur. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cmankind will consent to wear a more manageable\r\ncostume; or, at worst, we sculptors shall get the skill to make\r\nbroadcloth transparent, and render a majestic human character visible\r\nthrough the coats and trousers of the present day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are past my counsel. Show me the veiled\r\nfigure, which, I am afraid, I have criticised beforehand. To make\r\namends, I am in the mood to praise it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, as Kenyon was about to take the cloth off the clay model, she laid\r\nher hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me first what is the subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have sometimes\r\nincurred great displeasure from members of your brotherhood by being\r\ntoo obtuse to puzzle out the purport of their productions. It is so\r\ndifficult, you know, to compress and define a character or story,\r\nand make it patent at a glance, within the narrow scope attainable\r\nby sculpture! Indeed, I fancy it is still the ordinary habit with\r\nsculptors, first to finish their group of statuary,--in such development\r\nas the particular block of marble will allow,--and then to choose the\r\nsubject; as John of Bologna did with his Rape of the Sabines. Have you\r\nfollowed that good example?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; my statue is intended for Cleopatra,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kenyon, a little\r\ndisturbed by Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s raillery. \xe2\x80\x9cThe special epoch of her history you\r\nmust make out for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew away the cloth that had served to keep the moisture of the clay\r\nmodel from being exhaled. The sitting figure of a woman was seen. She\r\nwas draped from head to foot in a costume minutely and scrupulously\r\nstudied from that of ancient Egypt, as revealed by the strange sculpture\r\nof that country, its coins, drawings, painted mummy-cases, and whatever\r\nother tokens have been dug out of its pyramids, graves, and catacombs.\r\nEven the stiff Egyptian head-dress was adhered to, but had been softened\r\ninto a rich feminine adornment, without losing a particle of its\r\ntruth. Difficulties that might well have seemed insurmountable had been\r\ncourageously encountered and made flexible to purposes of grace and\r\ndignity; so that Cleopatra sat attired in a garb proper to her historic\r\nand queenly state, as a daughter of the Ptolemies, and yet such as\r\nthe beautiful woman would have put on as best adapted to heighten the\r\nmagnificence of her charms, and kindle a tropic fire in the cold eyes of\r\nOctavius.\r\n\r\nA marvellous repose--that rare merit in statuary, except it be the\r\nlumpish repose native to the block of stone--was diffused throughout the\r\nfigure. The spectator felt that Cleopatra had sunk down out of the fever\r\nand turmoil of her life, and for one instant--as it were, between two\r\npulse throbs--had relinquished all activity, and was resting throughout\r\nevery vein and muscle. It was the repose of despair, indeed; for\r\nOctavius had seen her, and remained insensible to her enchantments. But\r\nstill there was a great smouldering furnace deep down in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart. The repose, no doubt, was as complete as if she were never to\r\nstir hand or foot again; and yet, such was the creature\xe2\x80\x99s latent energy\r\nand fierceness, she might spring upon you like a tigress, and stop the\r\nvery breath that you were now drawing midway in your throat.\r\n\r\nThe face was a miraculous success. The sculptor had not shunned to\r\ngive the full Nubian lips, and other characteristics of the Egyptian\r\nphysiognomy. His courage and integrity had been abundantly rewarded; for\r\nCleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s beauty shone out richer, warmer, more triumphantly beyond\r\ncomparison, than if, shrinking timidly from the truth, he had chosen\r\nthe tame Grecian type. The expression was of profound, gloomy, heavily\r\nrevolving thought; a glance into her past life and present emergencies,\r\nwhile her spirit gathered itself up for some new struggle, or was\r\ngetting sternly reconciled to impending doom. In one view, there was a\r\ncertain softness and tenderness,--how breathed into the statue, among so\r\nmany strong and passionate elements, it is impossible to say. Catching\r\nanother glimpse, you beheld her as implacable as a stone and cruel as\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nIn a word, all Cleopatra--fierce, voluptuous, passionate, tender,\r\nwicked, terrible, and full of poisonous and rapturous enchantment--was\r\nkneaded into what, only a week or two before, had been a lump of wet\r\nclay from the Tiber. Soon, apotheosized in an indestructible material,\r\nshe would be one of the images that men keep forever, finding a heat in\r\nthem which does not cool down, throughout the centuries?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a woman is this!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam, after a long pause. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\r\ndid she ever try, even while you were creating her, to overcome you with\r\nher fury or her love? Were you not afraid to touch her, as she grew more\r\nand more towards hot life beneath your hand? My dear friend, it is a\r\ngreat work! How have you learned to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the concretion of a good deal of thought, emotion, and toil of\r\nbrain and hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, not without a perception that his work was\r\ngood; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know not how it came about at last. I kindled a great fire\r\nwithin my mind, and threw in the material,--as Aaron threw the gold\r\nof the Israelites into the furnace,--and in the midmost heat uprose\r\nCleopatra, as you see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I most marvel at,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cis the womanhood that you have so\r\nthoroughly mixed up with all those seemingly discordant elements. Where\r\ndid you get that secret? You never found it in your gentle Hilda, yet I\r\nrecognize its truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, surely, it was not in Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cHer womanhood is of the\r\nethereal type, and incompatible with any shadow of darkness or evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cthere are women of that ethereal\r\ntype, as you term it, and Hilda is one of them. She would die of her\r\nfirst wrong-doing,--supposing for a moment that she could be capable of\r\ndoing wrong. Of sorrow, slender as she seems, Hilda might bear a great\r\nburden; of sin, not a feather\xe2\x80\x99s weight. Methinks now, were it my doom, I\r\ncould bear either, or both at once; but my conscience is still as white\r\nas Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s. Do you question it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forbid, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sculptor.\r\n\r\nHe was startled at the strange turn which she had so suddenly given to\r\nthe conversation. Her voice, too,--so much emotion was stifled rather\r\nthan expressed in it, sounded unnatural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, with sudden passion, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you be my friend\r\nindeed? I am lonely, lonely, lonely! There is a secret in my heart that\r\nburns me,--that tortures me! Sometimes I fear to go mad of it; sometimes\r\nI hope to die of it; but neither of the two happens. Ah, if I could but\r\nwhisper it to only one human soul! And you--you see far into womanhood;\r\nyou receive it widely into your large view. Perhaps--perhaps, but Heaven\r\nonly knows, you might understand me! O, let me speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiriam, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sculptor, \xe2\x80\x9cif I can help you, speak\r\nfreely, as to a brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me? No!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam.\r\n\r\nKenyon\xe2\x80\x99s response had been perfectly frank and kind; and yet the\r\nsubtlety of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s emotion detected a certain reserve and alarm in his\r\nwarmly expressed readiness to hear her story. In his secret soul, to\r\nsay the truth, the sculptor doubted whether it were well for this\r\npoor, suffering girl to speak what she so yearned to say, or for him\r\nto listen. If there were any active duty of friendship to be performed,\r\nthen, indeed, he would joyfully have come forward to do his best. But if\r\nit were only a pent-up heart that sought an outlet? in that case it was\r\nby no means so certain that a confession would do good. The more her\r\nsecret struggled and fought to be told, the more certain would it be to\r\nchange all former relations that had subsisted between herself and the\r\nfriend to whom she might reveal it. Unless he could give her all the\r\nsympathy, and just the kind of sympathy that the occasion required,\r\nMiriam would hate him by and by, and herself still more, if he let her\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThis was what Kenyon said to himself; but his reluctance, after all, and\r\nwhether he were conscious of it or no, resulted from a suspicion that\r\nhad crept into his heart and lay there in a dark corner. Obscure as it\r\nwas, when Miriam looked into his eyes, she detected it at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I shall hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, echoing the thought which he had\r\nnot spoken; she was half choked with the gush of passion that was thus\r\nturned back upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are as cold and pitiless as your own marble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but full of sympathy, God knows!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\nIn truth, his suspicions, however warranted by the mystery in which\r\nMiriam was enveloped, had vanished in the earnestness of his kindly and\r\nsorrowful emotion. He was now ready to receive her trust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your sympathy, then, for sorrows that admit of such solace,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, making a strong effort to compose herself. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for my griefs, I\r\nknow how to manage them. It was all a mistake: you can do nothing for\r\nme, unless you petrify me into a marble companion for your Cleopatra\r\nthere; and I am not of her sisterhood, I do assure you. Forget this\r\nfoolish scene, my friend, and never let me see a reference to it in your\r\neyes when they meet mine hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince you desire it, all shall be forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sculptor,\r\npressing her hand as she departed; \xe2\x80\x9cor, if ever I can serve you, let my\r\nreadiness to do so be remembered. Meanwhile, dear Miriam, let us meet in\r\nthe same clear, friendly light as heretofore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are less sincere than I thought you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cif you try to\r\nmake me think that there will be no change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he attended her through the antechamber, she pointed to the statue of\r\nthe pearl-diver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy secret is not a pearl,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cyet a man might drown himself in\r\nplunging after it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter Kenyon had closed the door, she went wearily down the staircase,\r\nbut paused midway, as if debating with herself whether to return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mischief was done,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she; \xe2\x80\x9cand I might as well have had the\r\nsolace that ought to come with it. I have lost,--by staggering a little\r\nway beyond the mark, in the blindness of my distress, I have lost, as\r\nwe shall hereafter find, the genuine friendship of this clear-minded,\r\nhonorable, true-hearted young man, and all for nothing. What if I should\r\ngo back this moment and compel him to listen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ascended two or three of the stairs, but again paused, murmured to\r\nherself, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought; \xe2\x80\x9cand I wonder how I ever came to dream of\r\nit. Unless I had his heart for my own,--and that is Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s, nor would I\r\nsteal it from her,--it should never be the treasure Place of my secret.\r\nIt is no precious pearl, as I just now told him; but my dark-red\r\ncarbuncle--red as blood--is too rich a gem to put into a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncasket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went down the stairs, and found her shadow waiting for her in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AESTHETIC COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening after Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s studio, there was an\r\nassemblage composed almost entirely of Anglo-Saxons, and chiefly of\r\nAmerican artists, with a sprinkling of their English brethren; and some\r\nfew of the tourists who still lingered in Rome, now that Holy Week was\r\npast. Miriam, Hilda, and the sculptor were all three present, and with\r\nthem Donatello, whose life was so far turned from fits natural bent\r\nthat, like a pet spaniel, he followed his beloved mistress wherever he\r\ncould gain admittance.\r\n\r\nThe place of meeting was in the palatial, but somewhat faded and gloomy\r\napartment of an eminent member of the aesthetic body. It was no more\r\nformal an occasion than one of those weekly receptions, common among\r\nthe foreign residents of Rome, at which pleasant people--or disagreeable\r\nones, as the case may be--encounter one another with little ceremony.\r\n\r\nIf anywise interested in art, a man must be difficult to please who\r\ncannot find fit companionship among a crowd of persons, whose ideas and\r\npursuits all tend towards the general purpose of enlarging the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstock of beautiful productions.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief causes that make Rome the favorite residence of\r\nartists--their ideal home which they sigh for in advance, and are so\r\nloath to migrate from, after once breathing its enchanted air--is,\r\ndoubtless, that they there find themselves in force, and are numerous\r\nenough to create a congenial atmosphere. In every other clime they are\r\nisolated strangers; in this land of art, they are free citizens.\r\n\r\nNot that, individually, or in the mass, there appears to be any large\r\nstock of mutual affection among the brethren of the chisel and the\r\npencil. On the contrary, it will impress the shrewd observer that the\r\njealousies and petty animosities, which the poets of our day have flung\r\naside, still irritate and gnaw into the hearts of this kindred class of\r\nimaginative men. It is not difficult to suggest reasons why this should\r\nbe the fact. The public, in whose good graces lie the sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s or the\r\npainter\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of success, is infinitely smaller than the public to\r\nwhich literary men make their appeal. It is composed of a very limited\r\nbody of wealthy patrons; and these, as the artist well knows, are but\r\nblind judges in matters that require the utmost delicacy of perception.\r\nThus, success in art is apt to become partly an affair of intrigue; and\r\nit is almost inevitable that even a gifted artist should look askance at\r\nhis gifted brother\xe2\x80\x99s fame, and be chary of the good word that might help\r\nhim to sell still another statue or picture. You seldom hear a painter\r\nheap generous praise on anything in his special line of art; a sculptor\r\nnever has a favorable eye for any marble but his own.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of all these professional grudges, artists are\r\nconscious of a social warmth from each other\xe2\x80\x99s presence and contiguity.\r\nThey shiver at the remembrance of their lonely studios in the\r\nunsympathizing cities of their native land. For the sake of such\r\nbrotherhood as they can find, more than for any good that they get from\r\ngalleries, they linger year after year in Italy, while their originality\r\ndies out of them, or is polished away as a barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe company this evening included several men and women whom the world\r\nhas heard of, and many others, beyond all question, whom it ought to\r\nknow. It would be a pleasure to introduce them upon our humble pages,\r\nname by name, and had we confidence enough in our own taste--to crown\r\neach well-deserving brow according to its deserts. The opportunity\r\nis tempting, but not easily manageable, and far too perilous, both in\r\nrespect to those individuals whom we might bring forward, and the far\r\ngreater number that must needs be left in the shade. Ink, moreover, is\r\napt to have a corrosive quality, and might chance to raise a blister,\r\ninstead of any more agreeable titillation, on skins so sensitive as\r\nthose of artists. We must therefore forego the delight of illuminating\r\nthis chapter with personal allusions to men whose renown glows richly on\r\ncanvas, or gleams in the white moonlight of marble.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we might point to an artist who has studied Nature with\r\nsuch tender love that she takes him to her intimacy, enabling him to\r\nreproduce her in landscapes that seem the reality of a better earth,\r\nand yet are but the truth of the very scenes around us, observed by the\r\npainter\xe2\x80\x99s insight and interpreted for us by his skill. By his magic,\r\nthe moon throws her light far out of the picture, and the crimson of\r\nthe summer night absolutely glimmers on the beholder\xe2\x80\x99s face. Or we might\r\nindicate a poet-painter, whose song has the vividness of picture, and\r\nwhose canvas is peopled with angels, fairies, and water sprites, done to\r\nthe ethereal life, because he saw them face to face in his poetic mood.\r\nOr we might bow before an artist, who has wrought too sincerely, too\r\nreligiously, with too earnest a feeling, and too delicate a touch, for\r\nthe world at once to recognize how much toil and thought are compressed\r\ninto the stately brow of Prospero, and Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s maiden loveliness; or\r\nfrom what a depth within this painter\xe2\x80\x99s heart the Angel is leading forth\r\nSt. Peter.\r\n\r\nThus it would be easy to go on, perpetrating a score of little\r\nepigrammatical allusions, like the above, all kindly meant, but none\r\nof them quite hitting the mark, and often striking where they were not\r\naimed. It may be allowable to say, however, that American art is much\r\nbetter represented at Rome in the pictorial than in the sculpturesque\r\ndepartment. Yet the men of marble appear to have more weight with the\r\npublic than the men of canvas; perhaps on account of the greater density\r\nand solid substance of the material in which they work, and the sort\r\nof physical advantage which their labors thus acquire over the illusive\r\nunreality of color. To be a sculptor seems a distinction in itself;\r\nwhereas a painter is nothing, unless individually eminent.\r\n\r\nOne sculptor there was, an Englishman, endowed with a beautiful fancy,\r\nand possessing at his fingers\xe2\x80\x99 ends the capability of doing beautiful\r\nthings. He was a quiet, simple, elderly personage, with eyes brown and\r\nbright, under a slightly impending brow, and a Grecian profile, such as\r\nhe might have cut with his own chisel. He had spent his life, for forty\r\nyears, in making Venuses, Cupids, Bacchuses, and a vast deal of other\r\nmarble progeny of dreamwork, or rather frostwork: it was all a vapory\r\nexhalation out of the Grecian mythology, crystallizing on the dull\r\nwindow-panes of to-day. Gifted with a more delicate power than any other\r\nman alive, he had foregone to be a Christian reality, and perverted\r\nhimself into a Pagan idealist, whose business or efficacy, in our\r\npresent world, it would be exceedingly difficult to define. And, loving\r\nand reverencing the pure material in which he wrought, as surely this\r\nadmirable sculptor did, he had nevertheless robbed the marble of its\r\nchastity, by giving it an artificial warmth of hue. Thus it became a sin\r\nand shame to look at his nude goddesses. They had revealed themselves\r\nto his imagination, no doubt, with all their deity about them; but,\r\nbedaubed with buff color, they stood forth to the eyes of the profane in\r\nthe guise of naked women. But, whatever criticism may be ventured on\r\nhis style, it was good to meet a man so modest and yet imbued with such\r\nthorough and simple conviction of his own right principles and practice,\r\nand so quietly satisfied that his kind of antique achievement was all\r\nthat sculpture could effect for modern life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis eminent person\xe2\x80\x99s weight and authority among his artistic brethren\r\nwere very evident; for beginning unobtrusively to utter himself on\r\na topic of art, he was soon the centre of a little crowd of younger\r\nsculptors. They drank in his wisdom, as if it would serve all the\r\npurposes of original inspiration; he, meanwhile, discoursing with\r\ngentle calmness, as if there could possibly be no other side, and often\r\nratifying, as it were, his own conclusions by a mildly emphatic \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe veteran Sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s unsought audience was composed mostly of our own\r\ncountrymen. It is fair to say, that they were a body of very dexterous\r\nand capable artists, each of whom had probably given the delighted\r\npublic a nude statue, or had won credit for even higher skill by the\r\nnice carving of buttonholes, shoe-ties, coat-seams, shirt-bosoms, and\r\nother such graceful peculiarities of modern costume. Smart, practical\r\nmen they doubtless were, and some of them far more than this, but still\r\nnot precisely what an uninitiated person looks for in a sculptor. A\r\nsculptor, indeed, to meet the demands which our preconceptions make upon\r\nhim, should be even more indispensably a poet than those who deal in\r\nmeasured verse and rhyme. His material, or instrument, which serves\r\nhim in the stead of shifting and transitory language, is a pure, white,\r\nundecaying substance. It insures immortality to whatever is wrought in\r\nit, and therefore makes it a religious obligation to commit no idea\r\nto its mighty guardianship, save such as may repay the marble for\r\nits faithful care, its incorruptible fidelity, by warming it with an\r\nethereal life. Under this aspect, marble assumes a sacred character; and\r\nno man should dare to touch it unless he feels within himself a certain\r\nconsecration and a priesthood, the only evidence of which, for the\r\npublic eye, will be the high treatment of heroic subjects, or the\r\ndelicate evolution of spiritual, through material beauty.\r\n\r\nNo ideas such as the foregoing--no misgivings suggested by them\r\nprobably, troubled the self-complacency of most of these clever\r\nsculptors. Marble, in their view, had no such sanctity as we impute\r\nto it. It was merely a sort of white limestone from Carrara, cut into\r\nconvenient blocks, and worth, in that state, about two or three dollars\r\nper pound; and it was susceptible of being wrought into certain shapes\r\n(by their own mechanical ingenuity, or that of artisans in their\r\nemployment) which would enable them to sell it again at a much higher\r\nfigure. Such men, on the strength of some small knack in handling clay,\r\nwhich might have been fitly employed in making wax-work, are bold to\r\ncall themselves sculptors. How terrible should be the thought that the\r\nnude woman whom the modern artist patches together, bit by bit, from a\r\ndozen heterogeneous models, meaning nothing by her, shall last as long\r\nas the Venus of the Capitol!--that his group of--no matter what, since\r\nit has no moral or intellectual existence will not physically crumble\r\nany sooner than the immortal agony of the Laocoon!\r\n\r\nYet we love the artists, in every kind; even these, whose merits we are\r\nnot quite able to appreciate. Sculptors, painters, crayon sketchers, or\r\nwhatever branch of aesthetics they adopted, were certainly pleasanter\r\npeople, as we saw them that evening, than the average whom we meet\r\nin ordinary society. They were not wholly confined within the sordid\r\ncompass of practical life; they had a pursuit which, if followed\r\nfaithfully out, would lead them to the beautiful, and always had a\r\ntendency thitherward, even if they lingered to gather up golden dross\r\nby the wayside. Their actual business (though they talked about it very\r\nmuch as other men talk of cotton, politics, flour barrels, and sugar)\r\nnecessarily illuminated their conversation with something akin to the\r\nideal. So, when the guests collected themselves in little groups, here\r\nand there, in the wide saloon, a cheerful and airy gossip began to be\r\nheard. The atmosphere ceased to be precisely that of common life; a\r\nhint, mellow tinge, such as we see in pictures, mingled itself with the\r\nlamplight.\r\n\r\nThis good effect was assisted by many curious little treasures of\r\nart, which the host had taken care to strew upon his tables. They\r\nwere principally such bits of antiquity as the soil of Rome and its\r\nneighborhood are still rich in; seals, gems, small figures of bronze,\r\nmediaeval carvings in ivory; things which had been obtained at little\r\ncost, yet might have borne no inconsiderable value in the museum of a\r\nvirtuoso.\r\n\r\nAs interesting as any of these relics was a large portfolio of old\r\ndrawings, some of which, in the opinion of their possessor, bore\r\nevidence on their faces of the touch of master-hands. Very ragged and\r\nill conditioned they mostly were, yellow with time, and tattered with\r\nrough usage; and, in their best estate, the designs had been scratched\r\nrudely with pen and ink, on coarse paper, or, if drawn with charcoal or\r\na pencil, were now half rubbed out. You would not anywhere see rougher\r\nand homelier things than these. But this hasty rudeness made the\r\nsketches only the more valuable; because the artist seemed to have\r\nbestirred himself at the pinch of the moment, snatching up whatever\r\nmaterial was nearest, so as to seize the first glimpse of an idea\r\nthat might vanish in the twinkling of an eye. Thus, by the spell of\r\na creased, soiled, and discolored scrap of paper, you were enabled to\r\nsteal close to an old master, and watch him in the very effervescence of\r\nhis genius.\r\n\r\nAccording to the judgment of several connoisseurs, Raphael\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhand had communicated its magnetism to one of these sketches; and, if\r\ngenuine, it was evidently his first conception of a favorite Madonna,\r\nnow hanging in the private apartment of the Grand Duke, at Florence.\r\nAnother drawing was attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, and appeared to be\r\na somewhat varied design for his picture of Modesty and Vanity, in the\r\nSciarra Palace. There were at least half a dozen others, to which the\r\nowner assigned as high an origin. It was delightful to believe in their\r\nauthenticity, at all events; for these things make the spectator more\r\nvividly sensible of a great painter\xe2\x80\x99s power, than the final glow\r\nand perfected art of the most consummate picture that may have been\r\nelaborated from them. There is an effluence of divinity in the first\r\nsketch; and there, if anywhere, you find the pure light of inspiration,\r\nwhich the subsequent toil of the artist serves to bring out in stronger\r\nlustre, indeed, but likewise adulterates it with what belongs to an\r\ninferior mood. The aroma and fragrance of new thoughts were perceptible\r\nin these designs, after three centuries of wear and tear. The charm lay\r\npartly in their very imperfection; for this is suggestive, and sets\r\nthe imagination at work; whereas, the finished picture, if a good one,\r\nleaves the spectator nothing to do, and, if bad, confuses, stupefies,\r\ndisenchants, and disheartens him.\r\n\r\nHilda was greatly interested in this rich portfolio. She lingered so\r\nlong over one particular sketch, that Miriam asked her what discovery\r\nshe had made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at it carefully,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda, putting the sketch into her\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you take pains to disentangle the design from those\r\npencil-marks that seem to have been scrawled over it, I think you will\r\nsee something very curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a hopeless affair, I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI have neither\r\nyour faith, dear Hilda, nor your perceptive faculty. Fie! what a blurred\r\nscrawl it is indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe drawing had originally been very slight, and had suffered more\r\nfrom time and hard usage than almost any other in the collection; it\r\nappeared, too, that there had been an attempt (perhaps by the very hand\r\nthat drew it) to obliterate the design. By Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s help, however, Miriam\r\npretty distinctly made out a winged figure with a drawn sword, and a\r\ndragon, or a demon, prostrate at his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda in a low, reverential tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Guido\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown touches are on that ancient scrap of paper! If so, it must be his\r\noriginal sketch for the picture of the Archangel Michael setting his\r\nfoot upon the demon, in the Church of the Cappuccini. The composition\r\nand general arrangement of the sketch are the same with those of the\r\npicture; the only difference being, that the demon has a more upturned\r\nface, and scowls vindictively at the Archangel, who turns away his eyes\r\nin painful disgust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cThe expression suits the daintiness of\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s character, as Guido represents him. He never could have looked\r\nthe demon in the face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiriam!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her friend reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou grieve me, and you\r\nknow it, by pretending to speak contemptuously of the most beautiful and\r\nthe divinest figure that mortal painter ever drew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Hilda!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cYou take these matters more\r\nreligiously than I can, for my life. Guido\xe2\x80\x99s Archangel is a fine\r\npicture, of course, but it never impressed me as it does _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; we will not talk of that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I wanted you to\r\nnotice, in this sketch, is the face of the demon. It is entirely unlike\r\nthe demon of the finished picture. Guido, you know, always affirmed that\r\nthe resemblance to Cardinal Pamfili was either casual or imaginary. Now,\r\nhere is the face as he first conceived it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a more energetic demon, altogether, than that of the finished\r\npicture,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, taking the sketch into his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a spirit\r\nis conveyed into the ugliness of this strong, writhing, squirming\r\ndragon, under the Archangel\xe2\x80\x99s foot! Neither is the face an impossible\r\none. Upon my word, I have seen it somewhere, and on the shoulders of a\r\nliving man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so have I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was what struck me from the first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello, look at this face!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kenyon.\r\n\r\nThe young Italian, as may be supposed, took little interest in matters\r\nof art, and seldom or never ventured an opinion respecting them. After\r\nholding the sketch a single instant in his hand, he flung it from him\r\nwith a shudder of disgust and repugnance, and a frown that had all the\r\nbitterness of hatred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the face well!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s model!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was acknowledged both by Kenyon and Hilda that they had detected, or\r\nfancied, the resemblance which Donatello so strongly affirmed; and it\r\nadded not a little to the grotesque and weird character which, half\r\nplayfully, half seriously, they assigned to Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s attendant, to think\r\nof him as personating the demon\xe2\x80\x99s part in a picture of more than two\r\ncenturies ago. Had Guido, in his effort to imagine the utmost of sin\r\nand misery, which his pencil could represent, hit ideally upon just this\r\nface? Or was it an actual portrait of somebody, that haunted the old\r\nmaster, as Miriam was haunted now? Did the ominous shadow follow him\r\nthrough all the sunshine of his earlier career, and into the gloom that\r\ngathered about its close? And when Guido died, did the spectre betake\r\nhimself to those ancient sepulchres, there awaiting a new victim, till\r\nit was Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s ill-hap to encounter him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not acknowledge the resemblance at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, looking\r\nnarrowly at the sketch; \xe2\x80\x9cand, as I have drawn the face twenty times, I\r\nthink you will own that I am the best judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA discussion here arose, in reference to Guido\xe2\x80\x99s Archangel, and it was\r\nagreed that these four friends should visit the Church of the Cappuccini\r\nthe next morning, and critically examine the picture in question;\r\nthe similarity between it and the sketch being, at all events, a very\r\ncurious circumstance.\r\n\r\nIt was now a little past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when some of the company, who had\r\nbeen standing in a balcony, declared the moonlight to be resplendent.\r\nThey proposed a ramble through the streets, taking in their way some\r\nof those scenes of ruin which produced their best effects under the\r\nsplendor of the Italian moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOONLIGHT RAMBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal for a moonlight ramble was received with acclamation by\r\nall the younger portion of the company. They immediately set forth and\r\ndescended from story to story, dimly lighting their way by waxen tapers,\r\nwhich are a necessary equipment to those whose thoroughfare, in the\r\nnight-time, lies up and down a Roman staircase. Emerging from the\r\ncourtyard of the edifice, they looked upward and saw the sky full of\r\nlight, which seemed to have a delicate purple or crimson lustre, or, at\r\nleast some richer tinge than the cold, white moonshine of other\r\nskies. It gleamed over the front of the opposite palace, showing the\r\narchitectural ornaments of its cornice and pillared portal, as well as\r\nthe iron-barred basement windows, that gave such a prison-like aspect to\r\nthe structure, and the shabbiness and Squalor that lay along its base.\r\nA cobbler was just shutting up his little shop, in the basement of the\r\npalace; a cigar vender\xe2\x80\x99s lantern flared in the blast that came through\r\nthe archway; a French sentinel paced to and fro before the portal; a\r\nhomeless dog, that haunted thereabouts, barked as obstreperously at the\r\nparty as if he were the domestic guardian of the precincts.\r\n\r\nThe air was quietly full of the noise of falling water, the cause\r\nof which was nowhere visible, though apparently near at hand. This\r\npleasant, natural sound, not unlike that of a distant cascade in the\r\nforest, may be heard in many of the Roman streets and piazzas, when\r\nthe tumult of the city is hushed; for consuls, emperors, and popes, the\r\ngreat men of every age, have found no better way of immortalizing their\r\nmemories than by the shifting, indestructible, ever new, yet unchanging,\r\nupgush and downfall of water. They have written their names in that\r\nunstable element, and proved it a more durable record than brass or\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello, you had better take one of those gay, boyish artists for\r\nyour companion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, when she found the Italian youth at\r\nher side. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not now in a merry mood, as when we set all the world\r\na-dancing the other afternoon, in the Borghese grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never wish to dance any more,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Donatello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a melancholy was in that tone!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are getting\r\nspoilt in this dreary Rome, and will be as wise and as wretched as all\r\nthe rest of mankind, unless you go back soon to your Tuscan vineyards.\r\nWell; give me your arm, then! But take care that no friskiness comes\r\nover you. We must walk evenly and heavily to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party arranged itself according to its natural affinities or casual\r\nlikings; a sculptor generally choosing a painter, and a painter a\r\nsculp--tor, for his companion, in preference to brethren of their own\r\nart. Kenyon would gladly have taken Hilda to himself, and have drawn\r\nher a little aside from the throng of merry wayfarers. But she kept near\r\nMiriam, and seemed, in her gentle and quiet way, to decline a separate\r\nalliance either with him or any other of her acquaintances.\r\n\r\nSo they set forth, and had gone but a little way, when the narrow street\r\nemerged into a piazza, on one side of which, glistening and dimpling in\r\nthe moonlight, was the most famous fountain in Rome. Its murmur--not\r\nto say its uproar--had been in the ears of the company, ever since they\r\ncame into the open air. It was the Fountain of Trevi, which draws its\r\nprecious water from a source far beyond the walls, whence it flows\r\nhitherward through old subterranean aqueducts, and sparkles forth as\r\npure as the virgin who first led Agrippa to its well-spring, by her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall sip as much of this water as the hollow of my hand will hold,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Miriam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am leaving Rome in a few days; and the tradition goes, that a\r\nparting draught at the Fountain of Trevi insures the traveller\xe2\x80\x99s return,\r\nwhatever obstacles and improbabilities may seem to beset him. Will you\r\ndrink, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignorina, what you drink, I drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said the youth.\r\n\r\nThey and the rest of the party descended some steps to the water\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrim, and, after a sip or two, stood gazing at the absurd design of the\r\nfountain, where some sculptor of Bernini\xe2\x80\x99s school had gone absolutely\r\nmad in marble. It was a great palace front, with niches and many\r\nbas-reliefs, out of which looked Agrippa\xe2\x80\x99s legendary virgin, and several\r\nof the allegoric sisterhood; while, at the base, appeared Neptune, with\r\nhis floundering steeds, and Tritons blowing their horns about him, and\r\ntwenty other artificial fantasies, which the calm moonlight soothed into\r\nbetter taste than was native to them.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, it was as magnificent a piece of work as ever human\r\nskill contrived. At the foot of the palatial facade was strewn, with\r\ncareful art and ordered irregularity, a broad and broken heap of massive\r\nrock, looking is if it might have lain there since the deluge. Over a\r\ncentral precipice fell the water, in a semicircular cascade; and from\r\na hundred crevices, on all sides, snowy jets gushed up, and streams\r\nspouted out of the mouths and nostrils of stone monsters, and fell in\r\nglistening drops; while other rivulets, that had run wild, came leaping\r\nfrom one rude step to another, over stones that were mossy, slimy, and\r\ngreen with sedge, because, in a Century of their wild play, Nature had\r\nadopted the Fountain of Trevi, with all its elaborate devices, for her\r\nown. Finally, the water, tumbling, sparkling, and dashing, with\r\njoyous haste and never-ceasing murmur, poured itself into a great\r\nmarble-brimmed reservoir, and filled it with a quivering tide; on which\r\nwas seen, continually, a snowy semicircle of momentary foam from the\r\nprincipal cascade, as well as a multitude of snow points from smaller\r\njets. The basin occupied the whole breadth of the piazza, whence flights\r\nof steps descended to its border. A boat might float, and make voyages\r\nfrom one shore to another in this mimic lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the daytime, there is hardly a livelier scene in Rome than the\r\nneighborhood of the Fountain of Trevi; for the piazza is then filled\r\nwith the stalls of vegetable and fruit dealers, chestnut roasters,\r\ncigar venders, and other people, whose petty and wandering traffic\r\nis transacted in the open air. It is likewise thronged with idlers,\r\nlounging over the iron railing, and with Forestieri, who came hither to\r\nsee the famous fountain. Here, also, are seen men with buckets, urchins\r\nwith cans, and maidens (a picture as old as the patriarchal times)\r\nbearing their pitchers upon their heads. For the water of Trevi is in\r\nrequest, far and wide, as the most refreshing draught for feverish lips,\r\nthe pleasantest to mingle with wine, and the wholesomest to drink,\r\nin its native purity, that can anywhere be found. But now, at early\r\nmidnight, the piazza was a solitude; and it was a delight to behold this\r\nuntamable water, sporting by itself in the moonshine, and compelling\r\nall the elaborate trivialities of art to assume a natural aspect, in\r\naccordance with its own powerful simplicity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would be done with this water power,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested an artist, \xe2\x80\x9cif we\r\nhad it in one of our American cities? Would they employ it to turn the\r\nmachinery of a cotton mill, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good people would pull down those rampant marble deities,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nKenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cand, possibly, they would give me a commission to carve the\r\none-and-thirty (is that the number?) sister States, each pouring a\r\nsilver stream from a separate can into one vast basin, which should\r\nrepresent the grand reservoir of national prosperity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, if they wanted a bit of satire,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked an English artist, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncould set those same one-and-thirty States to cleansing the national\r\nflag of any stains that it may have incurred. The Roman washerwomen at\r\nthe lavatory yonder, plying their labor in the open air, would serve\r\nadmirably as models.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often intended to visit this fountain by moonlight,\xe2\x80\x9d, said\r\nMiriam, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it was here that the interview took place between\r\nCorinne and Lord Neville, after their separation and temporary\r\nestrangement. Pray come behind me, one of you, and let me try whether\r\nthe face can be recognized in the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaning over the stone brim of the basin, she heard footsteps stealing\r\nbehind her, and knew that somebody was looking over her shoulder. The\r\nmoonshine fell directly behind Miriam, illuminating the palace front and\r\nthe whole scene of statues and rocks, and filling the basin, as it were,\r\nwith tremulous and palpable light. Corinne, it will be remembered, knew\r\nLord Neville by the reflection of his face in the water. In Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncase, however (owing to the agitation of the water, its transparency,\r\nand the angle at which she was compelled to lean over), no reflected\r\nimage appeared; nor, from the same causes, would it have been possible\r\nfor the recognition between Corinne and her lover to take place. The\r\nmoon, indeed, flung Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s shadow at the bottom of the basin, as well\r\nas two more shadows of persons who had followed her, on either side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree shadows!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam--\xe2\x80\x9cthree separate shadows, all so black\r\nand heavy that they sink in the water! There they lie on the bottom,\r\nas if all three were drowned together. This shadow on my right is\r\nDonatello; I know him by his curls, and the turn of his head. My\r\nleft-hand companion puzzles me; a shapeless mass, as indistinct as the\r\npremonition of calamity! Which of you can it be? Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had turned round, while speaking, and saw beside her the strange\r\ncreature whose attendance on her was already familiar, as a marvel and\r\na jest; to the whole company of artists. A general burst of laughter\r\nfollowed the recognition; while the model leaned towards Miriam, as she\r\nshrank from him, and muttered something that was inaudible to those who\r\nwitnessed the scene. By his gestures, however, they concluded that he\r\nwas inviting her to bathe her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot be an Italian; at least not a Roman,\xe2\x80\x9d observed an artist. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever knew one of them to care about ablution. See him now! It is as\r\nif he were trying to wash off\xe2\x80\x99 the time-stains and earthly soil of a\r\nthousand years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDipping his hands into the capacious washbowl before him, the model\r\nrubbed them together with the utmost vehemence. Ever and anon, too,\r\nhe peeped into the water, as if expecting to see the whole Fountain of\r\nTrevi turbid with the results of his ablution. Miriam looked at him,\r\nsome little time, with an aspect of real terror, and even imitated him\r\nby leaning over to peep into the basin. Recovering herself, she took up\r\nsome of the water in the hollow of her hand, and practised an old form\r\nof exorcism by flinging it in her persecutor\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of all the Saints,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, \xe2\x80\x9cvanish, Demon, and let me\r\nbe free of you now and forever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not suffice,\xe2\x80\x9d said some of the mirthful party, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the\r\nFountain of Trevi gushes with holy water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, the exorcism was quite ineffectual upon the pertinacious demon,\r\nor whatever the apparition might be. Still he washed his brown, bony\r\ntalons; still he peered into the vast basin, as if all the water of that\r\ngreat drinking-cup of Rome must needs be stained black or sanguine; and\r\nstill he gesticulated to Miriam to follow his example. The spectators\r\nlaughed loudly, but yet with a kind of constraint; for the creature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naspect was strangely repulsive and hideous.\r\n\r\nMiriam felt her arm seized violently by Donatello. She looked at him,\r\nand beheld a tigerlike fury gleaming from his wild eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBid me drown him!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered he, shuddering between rage and horrible\r\ndisgust. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear his death gurgle in another instant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, peace, Donatello!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam soothingly, for this naturally\r\ngentle and sportive being seemed all aflame with animal rage. \xe2\x80\x9cDo him no\r\nmischief! He is mad; and we are as mad as he, if we suffer ourselves to\r\nbe disquieted by his antics. Let us leave him to bathe his hands till\r\nthe fountain run dry, if he find solace and pastime in it. What is it to\r\nyou or me, Donatello? There, there! Be quiet, foolish boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer tone and gesture were such as she might have used in taming down the\r\nwrath of a faithful hound, that had taken upon himself to avenge some\r\nsupposed affront to his mistress. She smoothed the young man\xe2\x80\x99s curls\r\n(for his fierce and sudden fury seemed to bristle among his hair), and\r\ntouched his cheek with her soft palm, till his angry mood was a little\r\nassuaged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignorina, do I look as when you first knew me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, with a\r\nheavy, tremulous sigh, as they went onward, somewhat apart from their\r\ncompanions. \xe2\x80\x9cMethinks there has been a change upon me, these many\r\nmonths; and more and more, these last few days. The joy is gone out of\r\nmy life; all gone! all gone! Feel my hand! Is it not very hot? Ah; and\r\nmy heart burns hotter still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Donatello, you are ill!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, with deep sympathy and\r\npity. \xe2\x80\x9cThis melancholy and sickly Rome is stealing away the rich, joyous\r\nlife that belongs to you. Go back, my dear friend, to your home among\r\nthe hills, where (as I gather from what you have told me) your days were\r\nfilled with simple and blameless delights. Have you found aught in the\r\nworld that is worth\xe2\x80\x99 what you there enjoyed? Tell me truly, Donatello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis burning pain in my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you are in the\r\nmidst of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, they had left the Fountain of Trevi considerably behind\r\nthem. Little further allusion was made to the scene at its margin; for\r\nthe party regarded Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor as diseased in his wits, and were\r\nhardly to be surprised by any eccentricity in his deportment.\r\n\r\nThreading several narrow streets, they passed through the Piazza of the\r\nHoly Apostles, and soon came to Trajan\xe2\x80\x99s Forum. All over the surface\r\nof what once was Rome, it seems to be the effort of Time to bury up the\r\nancient city, as if it were a corpse, and he the sexton; so that, in\r\neighteen centuries, the soil over its grave has grown very deep, by the\r\nslow scattering of dust, and the accumulation of more modern decay upon\r\nolder ruin.\r\n\r\nThis was the fate, also, of Trajan\xe2\x80\x99s Forum, until some papal antiquary,\r\na few hundred years ago, began to hollow it out again, and disclosed the\r\nfull height of the gigantic column wreathed round with bas-reliefs of\r\nthe old emperor\xe2\x80\x99s warlike deeds. In the area before it stands a grove of\r\nstone, consisting of the broken and unequal shafts of a vanished temple,\r\nstill keeping a majestic order, and apparently incapable of further\r\ndemolition. The modern edifices of the piazza (wholly built, no doubt,\r\nout of the spoil of its old magnificence) look down into the hollow\r\nspace whence these pillars rise.\r\n\r\nOne of the immense gray granite shafts lay in the piazza, on the verge\r\nof the area. It was a great, solid fact of the Past, making old Rome\r\nactually sensible to the touch and eye; and no study of history, nor\r\nforce of thought, nor magic of song, could so vitally assure us that\r\nRome once existed, as this sturdy specimen of what its rulers and people\r\nwrought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd see!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, laying his hand upon it, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is still a\r\npolish remaining on the hard substance of the pillar; and even now, late\r\nas it is, I can feel very sensibly the warmth of the noonday sun, which\r\ndid its best to heat it through. This shaft will endure forever. The\r\npolish of eighteen centuries ago, as yet but half rubbed off, and the\r\nheat of to-day\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine, lingering into the night, seem almost equally\r\nephemeral in relation to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is comfort to be found in the pillar,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9chard\r\nand heavy as it is. Lying here forever, as it will, it makes all human\r\ntrouble appear but a momentary annoyance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd human happiness as evanescent too,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Hilda, sighing; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nbeautiful art hardly less so! I do not love to think that this dull\r\nstone, merely by its massiveness, will last infinitely longer than\r\nany picture, in spite of the spiritual life that ought to give it\r\nimmortality!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, kissing her compassionately, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nyou sacrifice this greatest mortal consolation, which we derive from\r\nthe transitoriness of all things, from the right of saying, in every\r\nconjecture, \xe2\x80\x98This, too, will pass away,\xe2\x80\x99 would you give up this\r\nunspeakable boon, for the sake of making a picture eternal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir moralizing strain was interrupted by a demonstration from the rest\r\nof the party, who, after talking and laughing together, suddenly joined\r\ntheir voices, and shouted at full pitch,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrajan! Trajan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you deafen us with such an uproar?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Miriam.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the whole piazza had been filled with their idle vociferation;\r\nthe echoes from the surrounding houses reverberating the cry of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrajan,\xe2\x80\x9d on all sides; as if there was a great search for that imperial\r\npersonage, and not so much as a handful of his ashes to be found.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it was a good opportunity to air our voices in this resounding\r\npiazza,\xe2\x80\x9d replied one of the artists. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, we had really some hopes\r\nof summoning Trajan to look at his column, which, you know, he never\r\nsaw in his lifetime. Here is your model (who, they say, lived and sinned\r\nbefore Trajan\xe2\x80\x99s death) still wandering about Rome; and why not the\r\nEmperor Trajan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead emperors have very little delight in their columns, I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n observed Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that rich sculpture of Trajan\xe2\x80\x99s bloody warfare,\r\ntwining from the base of the pillar to its capital, may be but an ugly\r\nspectacle for his ghostly eyes, if he considers that this huge, storied\r\nshaft must be laid before the judgment-seat, as a piece of the evidence\r\nof what he did in the flesh. If ever I am employed to sculpture a hero\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmonument, I shall think of this, as I put in the bas-reliefs of the\r\npedestal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are sermons in stones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda thoughtfully, smiling at\r\nKenyon\xe2\x80\x99s morality; \xe2\x80\x9cand especially in the stones of Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe party moved on, but deviated a little from the straight way, in\r\norder to glance at the ponderous remains of the temple of Mars Ultot,\r\nwithin which a convent of nuns is now established,--a dove-cote, in the\r\nwar-god\xe2\x80\x99s mansion. At only a little distance, they passed the portico\r\nof a Temple of Minerva, most rich and beautiful in architecture, but\r\nwoefully gnawed by time and shattered by violence, besides being buried\r\nmidway in the accumulation of soil, that rises over dead Rome like a\r\nflood tide. Within this edifice of antique sanctity, a baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop\r\nwas now established, with an entrance on one side; for, everywhere, the\r\nremnants of old grandeur and divinity have been made available for the\r\nmeanest necessities of today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe baker is just drawing his loaves out of the oven,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Kenyon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you smell how sour they are? I should fancy that Minerva (in revenge\r\nfor the desecration of her temple) had slyly poured vinegar into the\r\nbatch, if I did not know that the modern Romans prefer their bread in\r\nthe acetous fermentation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey turned into the Via Alessandria, and thus gained the rear of the\r\nTemple of Peace, and, passing beneath its great arches, pursued their\r\nway along a hedge-bordered lane. In all probability, a stately Roman\r\nstreet lay buried beneath that rustic-looking pathway; for they had now\r\nemerged from the close and narrow avenues of the modern city, and were\r\ntreading on a soil where the seeds of antique grandeur had not yet\r\nproduced the squalid crop that elsewhere sprouts from them. Grassy as\r\nthe lane was, it skirted along heaps of shapeless ruin, and the bare\r\nsite of the vast temple that Hadrian planned and built. It terminated\r\non the edge of a somewhat abrupt descent, at the foot of which, with a\r\nmuddy ditch between, rose, in the bright moonlight, the great curving\r\nwall and multitudinous arches of the Coliseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRIAM\xe2\x80\x99S TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual of a moonlight evening, several carriages stood at the entrance\r\nof this famous ruin, and the precincts and interior were anything but a\r\nsolitude. The French sentinel on duty beneath the principal archway eyed\r\nour party curiously, but offered no obstacle to their admission. Within,\r\nthe moonlight filled and flooded the great empty space; it glowed upon\r\ntier above tier of ruined, grass-grown arches, and made them even\r\ntoo distinctly visible. The splendor of the revelation took away that\r\ninestimable effect of dimness and mystery by which the imagination\r\nmight be assisted to build a grander structure than the Coliseum, and to\r\nshatter it with a more picturesque decay. Byron\xe2\x80\x99s celebrated description\r\nis better than the reality. He beheld the scene in his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye,\r\nthrough the witchery of many intervening years, and faintly illuminated\r\nit as if with starlight instead of this broad glow of moonshine.\r\n\r\nThe party of our friends sat down, three or four of them on a prostrate\r\ncolumn, another on a shapeless lump of marble, once a Roman altar;\r\nothers on the steps of one of the Christian shrines. Goths and\r\nbarbarians though they were, they chatted as gayly together as if they\r\nbelonged to the gentle and pleasant race of people who now inhabit\r\nItaly. There was much pastime and gayety just then in the area of the\r\nColiseum, where so many gladiators and Wild beasts had fought and died,\r\nand where so much blood of Christian martyrs had been lapped up by that\r\nfiercest of wild beasts, the Roman populace of yore. Some youths and\r\nmaidens were running merry races across the open space, and playing at\r\nhide and seek a little way within the duskiness of the ground tier of\r\narches, whence now and then you could hear the half-shriek, halflaugh of\r\na frolicsome girl, whom the shadow had betrayed into a young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms. Elder groups were seated on the fragments of pillars and blocks\r\nof marble that lay round the verge of the arena, talking in the quick,\r\nshort ripple of the Italian tongue. On the steps of the great black\r\ncross in the centre of the Coliseum sat a party singing scraps of songs,\r\nwith much laughter and merriment between the stanzas.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange place for song and mirth. That black cross marks one of\r\nthe special blood-spots of the earth where, thousands of times over, the\r\ndying gladiator fell, and more of human agony has been endured for the\r\nmere pastime of the multitude than on the breadth of many battlefields.\r\nFrom all this crime and suffering, however, the spot has derived a more\r\nthan common sanctity. An inscription promises seven years\xe2\x80\x99 indulgence,\r\nseven years of remission from the pains of purgatory, and earlier\r\nenjoyment of heavenly bliss, for each separate kiss imprinted on the\r\nblack cross. What better use could be made of life, after middle age,\r\nwhen the accumulated sins are many and the remaining temptations few,\r\nthan to spend it all in kissing the black cross of the Coliseum!\r\n\r\nBesides its central consecration, the whole area has been made sacred\r\nby a range of shrines, which are erected round the circle, each\r\ncommemorating some scene or circumstance of the Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s passion and\r\nsuffering. In accordance with an ordinary custom, a pilgrim was\r\nmaking his progress from shrine to shrine upon his knees, and saying a\r\npenitential prayer at each. Light-footed girls ran across the path along\r\nwhich he crept, or sported with their friends close by the shrines\r\nwhere he was kneeling. The pilgrim took no heed, and the girls meant\r\nno irreverence; for in Italy religion jostles along side by side\r\nwith business and sport, after a fashion of its own, and people are\r\naccustomed to kneel down and pray, or see others praying, between two\r\nfits of merriment, or between two sins.\r\n\r\nTo make an end of our description, a red twinkle of light was visible\r\namid the breadth of shadow that fell across the upper part of the\r\nColiseum. Now it glimmered through a line of arches, or threw a broader\r\ngleam as it rose out of some profound abyss of ruin; now it was muffled\r\nby a heap of shrubbery which had adventurously clambered to that dizzy\r\nheight; and so the red light kept ascending to loftier and loftier\r\nranges of the structure, until it stood like a star where the blue sky\r\nrested against the Coliseum\xe2\x80\x99s topmost wall. It indicated a party of\r\nEnglish or Americans paying the inevitable visit by moonlight, and\r\nexalting themselves with raptures that were Byron\xe2\x80\x99s, not their own.\r\n\r\nOur company of artists sat on the fallen column, the pagan altar, and\r\nthe steps of the Christian shrine, enjoying the moonlight and shadow,\r\nthe present gayety and the gloomy reminiscences of the scene, in almost\r\nequal share. Artists, indeed, are lifted by the ideality of their\r\npursuits a little way off the earth, and are therefore able to catch\r\nthe evanescent fragrance that floats in the atmosphere of life above\r\nthe heads of the ordinary crowd. Even if they seem endowed with little\r\nimagination individually, yet there is a property, a gift, a talisman,\r\ncommon to their class, entitling them to partake somewhat more\r\nbountifully than other people in the thin delights of moonshine and\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful this is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda; and she sighed for very pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, who sat on the column, at her side. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Coliseum\r\nis far more delightful, as we enjoy it now, than when eighty thousand\r\npersons sat squeezed together, row above row, to see their fellow\r\ncreatures torn by lions and tigers limb from limb. What a strange\r\nthought that the Coliseum was really built for us, and has not come to\r\nits best uses till almost two thousand years after it was finished!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor Vespasian scarcely had us in his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda,\r\nsmiling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I thank him none the less for building it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gets small thanks, I fear, from the people whose bloody instincts\r\nhe pampered,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cFancy a nightly assemblage of eighty\r\nthousand melancholy and remorseful ghosts, looking down from those tiers\r\nof broken arches, striving to repent of the savage pleasures which they\r\nonce enjoyed, but still longing to enjoy them over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bring a Gothic horror into this peaceful moonlight scene,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHilda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I have good authority for peopling the Coliseum with phantoms,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n replied the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that veritable scene in Benvenuto\r\nCellini\xe2\x80\x99s autobiography, in which a necromancer of his acquaintance\r\ndraws a magic circle--just where the black cross stands now, I\r\nsuppose--and raises myriads of demons? Benvenuto saw them with his\r\nown eyes,--giants, pygmies, and other creatures of frightful aspect,\r\ncapering and dancing on yonder walls. Those spectres must have been\r\nRomans, in their lifetime, and frequenters of this bloody amphitheatre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a spectre, now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, with a little thrill of uneasiness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you watched that pilgrim, who is going round the whole circle of\r\nshrines, on his knees, and praying with such fervency at every one? Now\r\nthat he has revolved so far in his orbit, and has the moonshine on his\r\nface as he turns towards us, methinks I recognize him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Miriam! Do you think she sees him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked round, and perceived that Miriam had risen from the steps of\r\nthe shrine and disappeared. She had shrunk back, in fact, into the deep\r\nobscurity of an arch that opened just behind them.\r\n\r\nDonatello, whose faithful watch was no more to be eluded than that of\r\na hound, had stolen after her, and became the innocent witness of a\r\nspectacle that had its own kind of horror. Unaware of his presence,\r\nand fancying herself wholly unseen, the beautiful Miriam began to\r\ngesticulate extravagantly, gnashing her teeth, flinging her arms wildly\r\nabroad, stamping with her foot.\r\n\r\nIt was as if she had stepped aside for an instant, solely to snatch the\r\nrelief of a brief fit of madness. Persons in acute trouble, or laboring\r\nunder strong excitement, with a necessity for concealing it, are prone\r\nto relieve their nerves in this wild way; although, when practicable,\r\nthey find a more effectual solace in shrieking aloud.\r\n\r\nThus, as soon as she threw off her self-control, under the dusky arches\r\nof the Coliseum, we may consider Miriam as a mad woman, concentrating\r\nthe elements of a long insanity into that instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSignorina! signorina! have pity on me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Donatello, approaching\r\nher; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is too terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you look, at me!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam, with a start; then,\r\nwhispering below her breath, \xe2\x80\x9cmen have been struck dead for a less\r\noffence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you desire it, or need it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello humbly, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be\r\nloath to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, coming close to the young man, and speaking\r\nlow, but still the almost insanity of the moment vibrating in her voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you love yourself; if you desire those earthly blessings, such as\r\nyou, of all men, were made for; if you would come to a good old age\r\namong your olive orchards and your Tuscan vines, as your forefathers\r\ndid; if you would leave children to enjoy the same peaceful, happy,\r\ninnocent life, then flee from me. Look not behind you! Get you gone\r\nwithout another word.\xe2\x80\x9d He gazed sadly at her, but did not stir. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d Miriam went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a great evil hanging over me! I know\r\nit; I see it in the sky; I feel it in the air! It will overwhelm me\r\nas utterly as if this arch should crumble down upon our heads! It will\r\ncrush you, too, if you stand at my side! Depart, then; and make the sign\r\nof the cross, as your faith bids you, when an evil spirit is nigh. Cast\r\nme off, or you are lost forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA higher sentiment brightened upon Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s face than had hitherto\r\nseemed to belong to its simple expression and sensuous beauty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never quit you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot drive me from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Donatello!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam in a changed tone, and rather to herself\r\nthan him. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there no other that seeks me out, follows me,--is\r\nobstinate to share my affliction and my doom,--but only you! They call\r\nme beautiful; and I used to fancy that, at my need, I could bring the\r\nwhole world to my feet. And lo! here is my utmost need; and my beauty\r\nand my gifts have brought me only this poor, simple boy. Half-witted,\r\nthey call him; and surely fit for nothing but to be happy. And I accept\r\nhis aid! To-morrow, to-morrow, I will tell him all! Ah! what a sin to\r\nstain his joyous nature with the blackness of a woe like mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand to him, and smiled sadly as Donatello pressed it\r\nto his lips. They were now about to emerge from the depth of the arch;\r\nbut just then the kneeling pilgrim, in his revolution round the orbit of\r\nthe shrines, had reached the one on the steps of which Miriam had been\r\nsitting. There, as at the other shrines, he prayed, or seemed to\r\npray. It struck Kenyon, however,--who sat close by, and saw his face\r\ndistinctly, that the suppliant was merely performing an enjoined\r\npenance, and without the penitence that ought to have given it effectual\r\nlife. Even as he knelt, his eyes wandered, and Miriam soon felt that\r\nhe had detected her, half hidden as she was within the obscurity of the\r\narch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is evidently a good Catholic, however,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered one of the party.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I fear we cannot identify him with the ancient pagan who\r\nhaunts the catacombs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctors of the Propaganda may have converted him,\xe2\x80\x9d said another;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey have had fifteen hundred years to perform the task.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe company now deemed it time to continue their ramble. Emerging from\r\na side entrance of the Coliseum, they had on their left the Arch of\r\nConstantine, and above it the shapeless ruins of the Palace of the\r\nCaesars; portions of which have taken shape anew, in mediaeval convents\r\nand modern villas. They turned their faces cityward, and, treading over\r\nthe broad flagstones of the old Roman pavement, passed through the\r\nArch of Titus. The moon shone brightly enough within it to show the\r\nseven-branched Jewish candlestick, cut in the marble of the interior.\r\nThe original of that awful trophy lies buried, at this moment, in the\r\nyellow mud of the Tiber; and, could its gold of Ophir again be brought\r\nto light, it would be the most precious relic of past ages, in the\r\nestimation of both Jew and Gentile.\r\n\r\nStanding amid so much ancient dust, it is difficult to spare the reader\r\nthe commonplaces of enthusiasm, on which hundreds of tourists have\r\nalready insisted. Over this half-worn pavement, and beneath this Arch\r\nof Titus, the Roman armies had trodden in their outward march, to fight\r\nbattles a world\xe2\x80\x99s width away. Returning victorious, with royal captives\r\nand inestimable spoil, a Roman triumph, that most gorgeous pageant of\r\nearthly pride, had streamed and flaunted in hundred-fold succession\r\nover these same flagstones, and through this yet stalwart archway. It is\r\npolitic, however, to make few allusions to such a past; nor, if we would\r\ncreate an interest in the characters of our story, is it wise to suggest\r\nhow Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s foot may have stepped on yonder stone, or how Horace was\r\nwont to stroll near by, making his footsteps chime with the measure of\r\nthe ode that was ringing in his mind. The very ghosts of that massive\r\nand stately epoch have so much density that the actual people of to-day\r\nseem the thinner of the two, and stand more ghost-like by the arches\r\nand columns, letting the rich sculpture be discerned through their\r\nill-compacted substance.\r\n\r\nThe party kept onward, often meeting pairs and groups of midnight\r\nstrollers like themselves. On such a moonlight night as this, Rome keeps\r\nitself awake and stirring, and is full of song and pastime, the noise of\r\nwhich mingles with your dreams, if you have gone betimes to bed. But it\r\nis better to be abroad, and take our own share of the enjoyable time;\r\nfor the languor that weighs so heavily in the Roman atmosphere by day is\r\nlightened beneath the moon and stars.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the precincts of the Forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us settle it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, stamping his foot firmly down, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthis is precisely the spot where the chasm opened, into which Curtius\r\nprecipitated his good steed and himself. Imagine the great, dusky gap,\r\nimpenetrably deep, and with half-shaped monsters and hideous faces\r\nlooming upward out of it, to the vast affright of the good citizens who\r\npeeped over the brim! There, now, is a subject, hitherto unthought of,\r\nfor a grim and ghastly story, and, methinks, with a moral as deep as\r\nthe gulf itself. Within it, beyond a question, there were prophetic\r\nvisions,--intimations of all the future calamities of Rome,--shades of\r\nGoths, and Gauls, and even of the French soldiers of to-day. It was a\r\npity to close it up so soon! I would give much for a peep into such a\r\nchasm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cthat every person takes a peep into it\r\nin moments of gloom and despondency; that is to say, in his moments of\r\ndeepest insight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hilda. \xe2\x80\x9cI never peeped into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, and it will open for you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chasm was\r\nmerely one of the orifices of that pit of blackness that lies beneath\r\nus, everywhere. The firmest substance of human happiness is but a thin\r\ncrust spread over it, with just reality enough to bear up the illusive\r\nstage scenery amid which we tread. It needs no earthquake to open the\r\nchasm. A footstep, a little heavier than ordinary, will serve; and we\r\nmust step very daintily, not to break through the crust at any moment.\r\nBy and by, we inevitably sink! It was a foolish piece of heroism in\r\nCurtius to precipitate himself there, in advance; for all Rome, you see,\r\nhas been swallowed up in that gulf, in spite of him. The Palace of the\r\nCaesars has gone down thither, with a hollow, rumbling sound of its\r\nfragments! All the temples have tumbled into it; and thousands of\r\nstatues have been thrown after! All the armies and the triumphs have\r\nmarched into the great chasm, with their martial music playing, as they\r\nstepped over the brink. All the heroes, the statesmen, and the poets!\r\nAll piled upon poor Curtius, who thought to have saved them all! I am\r\nloath to smile at the self-conceit of that gallant horseman, but cannot\r\nwell avoid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt grieves me to hear you speak thus, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, whose\r\nnatural and cheerful piety was shocked by her friend\xe2\x80\x99s gloomy view of\r\nhuman destinies. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that there is no chasm, nor any hideous\r\nemptiness under our feet, except what the evil within us digs. If there\r\nbe such a chasm, let us bridge it over with good thoughts and deeds, and\r\nwe shall tread safely to the other side. It was the guilt of Rome, no\r\ndoubt, that caused this gulf to open; and Curtius filled it up with his\r\nheroic self-sacrifice and patriotism, which was the best virtue that the\r\nold Romans knew. Every wrong thing makes the gulf deeper; every right\r\none helps to fill it up. As the evil of Rome was far more than its good,\r\nthe whole commonwealth finally sank into it, indeed, but of no original\r\nnecessity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Hilda, it came to the same thing at last,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam\r\ndespondingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless, too,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the sculptor (for his imagination was greatly\r\nexcited by the idea of this wondrous chasm), \xe2\x80\x9call the blood that the\r\nRomans shed, whether on battlefields, or in the Coliseum, or on the\r\ncross,--in whatever public or private murder,--ran into this fatal gulf,\r\nand formed a mighty subterranean lake of gore, right beneath our feet.\r\nThe blood from the thirty wounds in Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s breast flowed hitherward,\r\nand that pure little rivulet from Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s bosom, too! Virginia,\r\nbeyond all question, was stabbed by her father, precisely where we are\r\nstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the spot is hallowed forever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there such blessed potency in bloodshed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, Hilda,\r\ndo not protest! I take your meaning rightly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey again moved forward. And still, from the Forum and the Via Sacra,\r\nfrom beneath the arches of the Temple of Peace on one side, and the\r\nacclivity of the Palace of the Caesars on the other, there arose singing\r\nvoices of parties that were strolling through the moonlight. Thus,\r\nthe air was full of kindred melodies that encountered one another, and\r\ntwined themselves into a broad, vague music, out of which no single\r\nstrain could be disentangled. These good examples, as well as the\r\nharmonious influences of the hour, incited our artist friends to make\r\nproof of their own vocal powers. With what skill and breath they had,\r\nthey set up a choral strain,--\xe2\x80\x9cHail, Columbia!\xe2\x80\x9d we believe, which\r\nthose old Roman echoes must have found it exceeding difficult to repeat\r\naright. Even Hilda poured the slender sweetness of her note into her\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s song. Miriam was at first silent, being perhaps unfamiliar\r\nwith the air and burden. But suddenly she threw out such a swell and\r\ngush of sound, that it seemed to pervade the whole choir of other\r\nvoices, and then to rise above them all, and become audible in what\r\nwould else have been thee silence of an upper region. That volume of\r\nmelodious voice was one of the tokens of a great trouble. There had long\r\nbeen an impulse upon her--amounting, at last, to a necessity to shriek\r\naloud; but she had struggled against it, till the thunderous anthem gave\r\nher an opportunity to relieve her heart by a great cry.\r\n\r\nThey passed the solitary Column of Phocas, and looked down into the\r\nexcavated space, where a confusion of pillars, arches, pavements, and\r\nshattered blocks and shafts--the crumbs of various ruin dropped from the\r\ndevouring maw of Time stand, or lie, at the base of the Capitoline Hill.\r\nThat renowned hillock (for it is little more) now arose abruptly above\r\nthem. The ponderous masonry, with which the hillside is built up, is as\r\nold as Rome itself, and looks likely to endure while the world retains\r\nany substance or permanence. It once sustained the Capitol, and now\r\nbears up the great pile which the mediaeval builders raised on the\r\nantique foundation, and that still loftier tower, which looks abroad\r\nupon a larger page of deeper historic interest than any other scene\r\ncan show. On the same pedestal of Roman masonry, other structures will\r\ndoubtless rise, and vanish like ephemeral things.\r\n\r\nTo a spectator on the spot, it is remarkable that the events of Roman\r\nhistory, and Roman life itself, appear not so distant as the Gothic ages\r\nwhich succeeded them. We stand in the Forum, or on the height of the\r\nCapitol, and seem to see the Roman epoch close at hand. We forget that\r\na chasm extends between it and ourselves, in which lie all those dark,\r\nrude, unlettered centuries, around the birth-time of Christianity, as\r\nwell as the age of chivalry and romance, the feudal system, and the\r\ninfancy of a better civilization than that of Rome. Or, if we remember\r\nthese mediaeval times, they look further off than the Augustan age. The\r\nreason may be, that the old Roman literature survives, and creates for\r\nus an intimacy with the classic ages, which we have no means of forming\r\nwith the subsequent ones.\r\n\r\nThe Italian climate, moreover, robs age of its reverence and makes it\r\nlook newer than it is. Not the Coliseum, nor the tombs of the Appian\r\nWay, nor the oldest pillar in the Forum, nor any other Roman ruin, be\r\nit as dilapidated as it may, ever give the impression of venerable\r\nantiquity which we gather, along with the ivy, from the gray walls of an\r\nEnglish abbey or castle. And yet every brick or stone, which we pick up\r\namong the former, had fallen ages before the foundation of the latter\r\nwas begun. This is owing to the kindliness with which Natures takes an\r\nEnglish ruin to her heart, covering it with ivy, as tenderly as Robin\r\nRedbreast covered the dead babes with forest leaves. She strives to make\r\nit a part of herself, gradually obliterating the handiwork of man, and\r\nsupplanting it with her own mosses and trailing verdure, till she has\r\nwon the whole structure back. But, in Italy, whenever man has once hewn\r\na stone, Nature forthwith relinquishes her right to it, and never lays\r\nher finger on it again. Age after age finds it bare and naked, in the\r\nbarren sunshine, and leaves it so. Besides this natural disadvantage,\r\ntoo, each succeeding century, in Rome, has done its best to ruin the\r\nvery ruins, so far as their picturesque effect is concerned, by stealing\r\naway the marble and hewn stone, and leaving only yellow bricks, which\r\nnever can look venerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party ascended the winding way that leads from the Forum to the\r\nPiazza of the Campidoglio on the summit of the Capitoline Hill. They\r\nstood awhile to contemplate the bronze equestrian statue of Marcus\r\nAurelius. The moonlight glistened upon traces of the gilding which\r\nhad once covered both rider and steed; these were almost gone, but the\r\naspect of dignity was still perfect, clothing the figure as it were with\r\nan imperial robe of light. It is the most majestic representation of\r\nthe kingly character that ever the world has seen. A sight of the old\r\nheathen emperor is enough to create an evanescent sentiment of loyalty\r\neven in a democratic bosom, so august does he look, so fit to rule,\r\nso worthy of man\xe2\x80\x99s profoundest homage and obedience, so inevitably\r\nattractive of his love. He stretches forth his hand with an air of grand\r\nbeneficence and unlimited authority, as if uttering a decree from which\r\nno appeal was permissible, but in which the obedient subject would\r\nfind his highest interests consulted; a command that was in itself a\r\nbenediction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sculptor of this statue knew what a king should be,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nKenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cand knew, likewise, the heart of mankind, and how it craves a\r\ntrue ruler, under whatever title, as a child its father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, if there were but one such man as this?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cOne such\r\nman in an age, and one in all the world; then how speedily would the\r\nstrife, wickedness, and sorrow of us poor creatures be relieved. We\r\nwould come to him with our griefs, whatever they might be,--even a poor,\r\nfrail woman burdened with her heavy heart,--and lay them at his feet,\r\nand never need to take them up again. The rightful king would see to\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea of the regal office and duty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s idea of the whole matter to perfection. It is Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ntoo, no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the quiet Hilda; \xe2\x80\x9cI should never look for such assistance\r\nfrom an earthly king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHilda, my religious Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miriam, suddenly drawing the girl\r\nclose to her, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know how it is with me? I would give all I have or\r\nhope--my life, O how freely--for one instant of your trust in God! You\r\nlittle guess my need of it. You really think, then, that He sees and\r\ncares for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiriam, you frighten me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, hush? do not let them hear yet!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI frighten\r\nyou, you say; for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, how? Am I strange? Is there anything\r\nwild in my behavior?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly for that moment,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Hilda, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you seemed to doubt\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s providence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk of that another time,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend. \xe2\x80\x9cJust now it is\r\nvery dark to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Piazza of the Campidoglio, as you face cityward, and\r\nat the head of the long and stately flight of steps descending from the\r\nCapitoline Hill to the level of lower Rome, there is a narrow lane\r\nor passage. Into this the party of our friends now turned. The path\r\nascended a little, and ran along under the walls of a palace, but soon\r\npassed through a gateway, and terminated in a small paved courtyard. It\r\nwas bordered by a low parapet.\r\n\r\nThe spot, for some reason or other, impressed them as exceedingly\r\nlonely. On one side was the great height of the palace, with the\r\nmoonshine falling over it, and showing all the windows barred and\r\nshuttered. Not a human eye could look down into the little courtyard,\r\neven if the seemingly deserted palace had a tenant. On all other sides\r\nof its narrow compass there was nothing but the parapet, which as it now\r\nappeared was built right on the edge of a steep precipice. Gazing\r\nfrom its imminent brow, the party beheld a crowded confusion of roofs\r\nspreading over the whole space between them and the line of hills that\r\nlay beyond the Tiber. A long, misty wreath, just dense enough to catch\r\na little of the moonshine, floated above the houses, midway towards the\r\nhilly line, and showed the course of the unseen river. Far away on the\r\nright, the moon gleamed on the dome of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s as well as on many\r\nlesser and nearer domes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beautiful view of the city!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hilda; \xe2\x80\x9cand I never saw\r\nRome from this point before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought to afford a good prospect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor; \xe2\x80\x9cfor it\r\nwas from this point--at least we are at liberty to think so, if we\r\nchoose--that many a famous Roman caught his last glimpse of his native\r\ncity, and of all other earthly things. This is one of the sides of the\r\nTarpeian Rock. Look over the parapet, and see what a sheer tumble there\r\nmight still be for a traitor, in spite of the thirty feet of soil that\r\nhave accumulated at the foot of the precipice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all bent over, and saw that the cliff fell perpendicularly downward\r\nto about the depth, or rather more, at which the tall palace rose in\r\nheight above their heads. Not that it was still the natural, shaggy\r\nfront of the original precipice; for it appeared to be cased in ancient\r\nstonework, through which the primeval rock showed its face here and\r\nthere grimly and doubtfully. Mosses grew on the slight projections, and\r\nlittle shrubs sprouted out of the crevices, but could not much soften\r\nthe stern aspect of the cliff. Brightly as the Italian moonlight fell\r\nadown the height, it scarcely showed what portion of it was man\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nand what was nature\xe2\x80\x99s, but left it all in very much the same kind of\r\nambiguity and half-knowledge in which antiquarians generally leave the\r\nidentity of Roman remains.\r\n\r\nThe roofs of some poor-looking houses, which had been built against the\r\nbase and sides of the cliff, rose nearly midway to the top; but from an\r\nangle of the parapet there was a precipitous plunge straight downward\r\ninto a stonepaved court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer this to any other site as having been veritably the Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLeap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it was so convenient to the Capitol. It was\r\nan admirable idea of those stern old fellows to fling their political\r\ncriminals down from the very summit on which stood the Senate House and\r\nJove\xe2\x80\x99s Temple, emblems of the institutions which they sought to violate.\r\nIt symbolizes how sudden was the fall in those days from the utmost\r\nheight of ambition to its profoundest ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come; it is midnight,\xe2\x80\x9d cried another artist, \xe2\x80\x9ctoo late to be\r\nmoralizing here. We are literally dreaming on the edge of a precipice.\r\nLet us go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda.\r\n\r\nThe sculptor was not without hopes that he might be favored with the\r\nsweet charge of escorting Hilda to the foot of her tower. Accordingly,\r\nwhen the party prepared to turn back, he offered her his arm. Hilda at\r\nfirst accepted it; but when they had partly threaded the passage between\r\nthe little courtyard and the Piazza del Campidoglio, she discovered that\r\nMiriam had remained behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, withdrawing her arm from Kenyon\xe2\x80\x99s; \xe2\x80\x9cbut pray\r\ndo not come with me. Several times this evening I have had a fancy that\r\nMiriam had something on her mind, some sorrow or perplexity, which,\r\nperhaps, it would relieve her to tell me about. No, no; do not turn\r\nback! Donatello will be a sufficient guardian for Miriam and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sculptor was a good deal mortified, and perhaps a little angry: but\r\nhe knew Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s mood of gentle decision and independence too well not to\r\nobey her. He therefore suffered the fearless maiden to return alone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Miriam had not noticed the departure of the rest of the\r\ncompany; she remained on the edge of the precipice and Donatello along\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a fatal fall, still,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, looking over the\r\nparapet, and shuddering as her eye measured the depth. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; surely yes!\r\nEven without the weight of an overburdened heart, a human body would\r\nfall heavily enough upon those stones to shake all its joints asunder.\r\nHow soon it would be over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello, of whose presence she was possibly not aware, now pressed\r\ncloser to her side; and he, too, like Miriam, bent over the low parapet\r\nand trembled violently. Yet he seemed to feel that perilous fascination\r\nwhich haunts the brow of precipices, tempting the unwary one to fling\r\nhimself over for the very horror of the thing; for, after drawing\r\nhastily back, he again looked down, thrusting himself out farther than\r\nbefore. He then stood silent a brief space, struggling, perhaps, to make\r\nhimself conscious of the historic associations of the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking earnestly in her face, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have been\r\nflung over here in days gone by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen that cumbered the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cMen whose lives were the\r\nbane of their fellow creatures. Men who poisoned the air, which is the\r\ncommon breath of all, for their own selfish purposes. There was short\r\nwork with such men in old Roman times. Just in the moment of their\r\ntriumph, a hand, as of an avenging giant, clutched them, and dashed the\r\nwretches down this precipice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it well done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was well done,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent persons were saved by the\r\ndestruction of a guilty one, who deserved his doom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this brief conversation passed, Donatello had once or twice\r\nglanced aside with a watchful air, just as a hound may often be seen to\r\ntake sidelong note of some suspicious object, while he gives his more\r\ndirect attention to something nearer at, hand. Miriam seemed now first\r\nto become aware of the silence that had followed upon the cheerful talk\r\nand laughter of a few moments before.\r\n\r\nLooking round, she perceived that all her company of merry friends had\r\nretired, and Hilda, too, in whose soft and quiet presence she had always\r\nan indescribable feeling of security. All gone; and only herself and\r\nDonatello left hanging over the brow of the ominous precipice.\r\n\r\nNot so, however; not entirely alone! In the basement wall of the palace,\r\nshaded from the moon, there was a deep, empty niche, that had probably\r\nonce contained a statue; not empty, either; for a figure now came forth\r\nfrom it and approached Miriam. She must have had cause to dread some\r\nunspeakable evil from this strange persecutor, and to know that this was\r\nthe very crisis of her calamity; for as he drew near, such a cold, sick\r\ndespair crept over her that it impeded her breath, and benumbed her\r\nnatural promptitude of thought. Miriam seemed dreamily to remember\r\nfalling on her knees; but, in her whole recollection of that wild\r\nmoment, she beheld herself as in a dim show, and could not well\r\ndistinguish what was done and suffered; no, not even whether she were\r\nreally an actor and sufferer in the scene.\r\n\r\nHilda, meanwhile, had separated herself from the sculptor, and turned\r\nback to rejoin her friend. At a distance, she still heard the mirth of\r\nher late companions, who were going down the cityward descent of the\r\nCapitoline Hill; they had set up a new stave of melody, in which her\r\nown soft voice, as well as the powerful sweetness of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s, was sadly\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\nThe door of the little courtyard had swung upon its hinges, and\r\npartly closed itself. Hilda (whose native gentleness pervaded all her\r\nmovements) was quietly opening it, when she was startled, midway, by the\r\nnoise of a struggle within, beginning and ending all in one breathless\r\ninstant. Along with it, or closely succeeding it, was a loud, fearful\r\ncry, which quivered upward through the air, and sank quivering\r\ndownward to the earth. Then, a silence! Poor Hilda had looked into the\r\ncourt-yard, and saw the whole quick passage of a deed, which took but\r\nthat little time to grave itself in the eternal adamant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAUN\xe2\x80\x99S TRANSFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe door of the courtyard swung slowly, and closed itself of its own\r\naccord. Miriam and Donatello were now alone there. She clasped her\r\nhands, and looked wildly at the young man, whose form seemed to have\r\ndilated, and whose eyes blazed with the fierce energy that had suddenly\r\ninspired him. It had kindled him into a man; it had developed within him\r\nan intelligence which was no native characteristic of the Donatello whom\r\nwe have heretofore known. But that simple and joyous creature was gone\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, in a horror-stricken whisper.\r\n\r\nThe glow of rage was still lurid on Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s face, and now flashed\r\nout again from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did what ought to be done to a traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI did what your\r\neyes bade me do, when I asked them with mine, as I held the wretch over\r\nthe precipice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese last words struck Miriam like a bullet. Could it be so? Had her\r\neyes provoked or assented to this deed? She had not known it. But, alas!\r\nlooking back into the frenzy and turmoil of the scene just acted, she\r\ncould not deny--she was not sure whether it might be so, or no--that a\r\nwild joy had flamed up in her heart, when she beheld her persecutor in\r\nhis mortal peril. Was it horror?--or ecstasy? or both in one? Be the\r\nemotion what it might, it had blazed up more madly, when Donatello\r\nflung his victim off the cliff, and more and more, while his shriek went\r\nquivering downward. With the dead thump upon the stones below had come\r\nan unutterable horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my eyes bade you do it!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she.\r\n\r\nThey both leaned over the parapet, and gazed downward as earnestly as if\r\nsome inestimable treasure had fallen over, and were yet recoverable.\r\nOn the pavement below was a dark mass, lying in a heap, with little or\r\nnothing human in its appearance, except that the hands were stretched\r\nout, as if they might have clutched for a moment at the small square\r\nstones. But there was no motion in them now. Miriam watched the heap of\r\nmortality while she could count a hundred, which she took pains to do.\r\nNo stir; not a finger moved!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have killed him, Donatello! He is quite dead!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cStone\r\ndead! Would I were so, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not mean that he should die?\xe2\x80\x9d sternly asked Donatello, still in\r\nthe glow of that intelligence which passion had developed in him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwas short time to weigh the matter; but he had his trial in that breath\r\nor two while I held him over the cliff, and his sentence in that one\r\nglance, when your eyes responded to mine! Say that I have slain him\r\nagainst your will,--say that he died without your whole consent,--and,\r\nin another breath, you shall see me lying beside him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, never!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cMy one, own friend! Never, never, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to him,--the guilty, bloodstained, lonely woman,--she turned\r\nto her fellow criminal, the youth, so lately innocent, whom she had\r\ndrawn into her doom. She pressed him close, close to her bosom, with a\r\nclinging embrace that brought their two hearts together, till the horror\r\nand agony of each was combined into one emotion, and that a kind of\r\nrapture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Donatello, you speak the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cmy heart consented to\r\nwhat you did. We two slew yonder wretch. The deed knots us together, for\r\ntime and eternity, like the coil of a serpent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey threw one other glance at the heap of death below, to assure\r\nthemselves that it was there; so like a dream was the whole thing. Then\r\nthey turned from that fatal precipice, and came out of the courtyard,\r\narm in arm, heart in heart. Instinctively, they were heedful not to\r\nsever themselves so much as a pace or two from one another, for fear\r\nof the terror and deadly chill that would thenceforth wait for them\r\nin solitude. Their deed--the crime which Donatello wrought, and Miriam\r\naccepted on the instant--had wreathed itself, as she said, like a\r\nserpent, in inextricable links about both their souls, and drew them\r\ninto one, by its terrible contractile power. It was closer than a\r\nmarriage bond. So intimate, in those first moments, was the union, that\r\nit seemed as if their new sympathy annihilated all other ties, and that\r\nthey were released from the chain of humanity; a new sphere, a special\r\nlaw, had been created for them alone. The world could not come near\r\nthem; they were safe!\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the flight of steps leading downward from the Capitol,\r\nthere was a faroff noise of singing and laughter. Swift, indeed, had\r\nbeen the rush of the crisis that was come and gone! This was still the\r\nmerriment of the party that had so recently been their companions. They\r\nrecognized the voices which, a little while ago, had accorded and sung\r\nin cadence with their own. But they were familiar voices no more; they\r\nsounded strangely, and, as it were, out of the depths of space; so\r\nremote was all that pertained to the past life of these guilty ones, in\r\nthe moral seclusion that had suddenly extended itself around them. But\r\nhow close, and ever closer, did the breath of the immeasurable waste,\r\nthat lay between them and all brotherhood or sisterhood, now press them\r\none within the other!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO friend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miriam, so putting her soul into the word that it\r\ntook a heavy richness of meaning, and seemed never to have been spoken\r\nbefore, \xe2\x80\x9cO friend, are you conscious, as I am, of this companionship\r\nthat knits our heart-strings together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel it, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello. \xe2\x80\x9cWe draw one breath; we live one\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cnay, only a short half-hour ago,\r\nI shivered in an icy solitude. No friendship, no sisterhood, could come\r\nnear enough to keep the warmth within my heart. In an instant all is\r\nchanged! There can be no more loneliness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, my beautiful one!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Miriam, gazing in his face, which\r\nhad taken a higher, almost an heroic aspect, from the strength of\r\npassion. \xe2\x80\x9cNone, my innocent one! Surely, it is no crime that we have\r\ncommitted. One wretched and worthless life has been sacrificed to cement\r\ntwo other lives for evermore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor evermore, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello; \xe2\x80\x9ccemented with his blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man started at the word which he had himself spoken; it may be\r\nthat it brought home, to the simplicity of his imagination, what he had\r\nnot before dreamed of,--the ever-increasing loathsomeness of a union\r\nthat consists in guilt. Cemented with blood, which would corrupt and\r\ngrow more noisome forever and forever, but bind them none the less\r\nstrictly for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget it! Cast it all behind you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, detecting, by her\r\nsympathy, the pang that was in his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cThe deed has done its office,\r\nand has no existence any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey flung the past behind them, as she counselled, or else distilled\r\nfrom it a fiery, intoxication, which sufficed to carry them triumphantly\r\nthrough those first moments of their doom. For guilt has its moment of\r\nrapture too. The foremost result of a broken law is ever an ecstatic\r\nsense of freedom. And thus there exhaled upward (out of their dark\r\nsympathy, at the base of which lay a human corpse) a bliss, or an\r\ninsanity, which the unhappy pair imagined to be well worth the sleepy\r\ninnocence that was forever lost to them.\r\n\r\nAs their spirits rose to the solemn madness of the occasion, they went\r\nonward, not stealthily, not fearfully, but with a stately gait and\r\naspect. Passion lent them (as it does to meaner shapes) its brief\r\nnobility of carriage. They trod through the streets of Rome, as if they,\r\ntoo, were among the majestic and guilty shadows, that, from ages\r\nlong gone by, have haunted the blood-stained city. And, at Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuggestion, they turned aside, for the sake of treading loftily past the\r\nold site of Pompey\xe2\x80\x99s Forum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor there was a great deed done here!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,--\xe2\x80\x9ca deed of blood\r\nlike ours! Who knows but we may meet the high and ever-sad fraternity of\r\nCaesar\xe2\x80\x99s murderers, and exchange a salutation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they our brethren, now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Donatello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; all of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam,--\xe2\x80\x9cand many another, whom the world\r\nlittle dreams of, has been made our brother or our sister, by what we\r\nhave done within this hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at the thought she shivered. Where then was the seclusion, the\r\nremoteness, the strange, lonesome Paradise, into which she and her one\r\ncompanion had been transported by their crime? Was there, indeed, no\r\nsuch refuge, but only a crowded thoroughfare and jostling throng of\r\ncriminals? And was it true, that whatever hand had a blood-stain on\r\nit,--or had poured out poison,--or strangled a babe at its birth,--or\r\nclutched a grandsire\xe2\x80\x99s throat, he sleeping, and robbed him of his few\r\nlast breaths,--had now the right to offer itself in fellowship with\r\ntheir two hands? Too certainly, that right existed. It is a terrible\r\nthought, that an individual wrong-doing melts into the great mass of\r\nhuman crime, and makes us, who dreamed only of our own little separate\r\nsin,--makes us guilty of the whole. And thus Miriam and her lover were\r\nnot an insulated pair, but members of an innumerable confraternity of\r\nguilty ones, all shuddering at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not now; not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-night, at least,\r\nthere shall be no remorse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWandering without a purpose, it so chanced that they turned into a\r\nstreet, at one extremity of which stood Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s tower. There was a\r\nlight in her high chamber; a light, too, at the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s shrine; and the\r\nglimmer of these two was the loftiest light beneath the stars. Miriam\r\ndrew Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s arm, to make him stop, and while they stood at some\r\ndistance looking at Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s window, they beheld her approach and throw\r\nit open. She leaned far forth, and extended her clasped hands towards\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good, pure child! She is praying, Donatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, with a\r\nkind of simple joy at witnessing the devoutness of her friend. Then her\r\nown sin rushed upon her, and she shouted, with the rich strength of her\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cPray for us, Hilda; we need it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether Hilda heard and recognized the voice we cannot tell. The window\r\nwas immediately closed, and her form disappeared from behind the snowy\r\ncurtain. Miriam felt this to be a token that the cry of her condemned\r\nspirit was shut out of heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURIAL CHANT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of the Capuchins (where, as the reader may remember, some of\r\nour acquaintances had made an engagement to meet) stands a little aside\r\nfrom the Piazza Barberini. Thither, at the hour agreed upon, on the\r\nmorning after the scenes last described, Miriam and Donatello directed\r\ntheir steps. At no time are people so sedulously careful to keep their\r\ntrifling appointments, attend to their ordinary occupations, and thus\r\nput a commonplace aspect on life, as when conscious of some secret that\r\nif suspected would make them look monstrous in the general eye.\r\n\r\nYet how tame and wearisome is the impression of all ordinary things in\r\nthe contrast with such a fact! How sick and tremulous, the next morning,\r\nis the spirit that has dared so much only the night before! How icy cold\r\nis the heart, when the fervor, the wild ecstasy of passion has faded\r\naway, and sunk down among the dead ashes of the fire that blazed so\r\nfiercely, and was fed by the very substance of its life! How faintly\r\ndoes the criminal stagger onward, lacking the impulse of that strong\r\nmadness that hurried him into guilt, and treacherously deserts him in\r\nthe midst of it!\r\n\r\nWhen Miriam and Donatello drew near the church, they found only Kenyon\r\nawaiting them on the steps. Hilda had likewise promised to be of the\r\nparty, but had not yet appeared. Meeting the sculptor, Miriam put a\r\nforce upon herself and succeeded in creating an artificial flow\r\nof spirits, which, to any but the nicest observation, was quite as\r\neffective as a natural one. She spoke sympathizingly to the sculptor on\r\nthe subject of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s absence, and somewhat annoyed him by alluding in\r\nDonatello\xe2\x80\x99s hearing to an attachment which had never been openly avowed,\r\nthough perhaps plainly enough betrayed. He fancied that Miriam did not\r\nquite recognize the limits of the strictest delicacy; he even went so\r\nfar as to generalize, and conclude within himself, that this deficiency\r\nis a more general failing in woman than in man, the highest refinement\r\nbeing a masculine attribute.\r\n\r\nBut the idea was unjust to the sex at large, and especially so to this\r\npoor Miriam, who was hardly responsible for her frantic efforts to be\r\ngay. Possibly, moreover, the nice action of the mind is set ajar by any\r\nviolent shock, as of great misfortune or great crime, so that the finer\r\nperceptions may be blurred thenceforth, and the effect be traceable in\r\nall the minutest conduct of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see anything of the dear child after you left us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMiriam, still keeping Hilda as her topic of conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cI missed her\r\nsadly on my way homeward; for nothing insures me such delightful and\r\ninnocent dreams (I have experienced it twenty times) as a talk late in\r\nthe evening with Hilda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I should imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sculptor gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is an\r\nadvantage that I have little or no opportunity of enjoying. I know not\r\nwhat became of Hilda after my parting from you. She was not especially\r\nmy companion in any part of our walk. The last I saw of her she\r\nwas hastening back to rejoin you in the courtyard of the Palazzo\r\nCaffarelli.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miriam, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen did you not see her again?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Kenyon, in some alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot there,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cindeed, I followed pretty closely\r\non the heels of the rest of the party. But do not be alarmed on Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount; the Virgin is bound to watch over the good child, for the sake\r\nof the piety with which she keeps the lamp alight at her shrine. And\r\nbesides, I have always felt that Hilda is just as safe in these evil\r\nstreets of Rome as her white doves when they fly downwards from the\r\ntower top, and run to and fro among the horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet. There is certainly\r\na providence on purpose for Hilda, if for no other human creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI religiously believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the sculptor; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet my mind\r\nwould be the easier, if I knew that she had returned safely to her\r\ntower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen make yourself quite easy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw her (and it\r\nis the last sweet sight that I remember) leaning from her window midway\r\nbetween earth and sky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKenyon now looked at Donatello.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem out of spirits, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis languid\r\nRoman atmosphere is not the airy wine that you were accustomed to\r\nbreathe at home. I have not forgotten your hospitable invitation to\r\nmeet you this summer at your castle among the Apennines. It is my fixed\r\npurpose to come, I assure you. We shall both be the better for some deep\r\ndraughts of the mountain breezes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may he,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello, with unwonted sombreness; \xe2\x80\x9cthe old house\r\nseemed joyous when I was a child. But as I remember it now it was a grim\r\nplace, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sculptor looked more attentively at the young man, and was surprised\r\nand alarmed to observe how entirely the fine, fresh glow of animal\r\nspirits had departed out of his face. Hitherto, moreover, even while he\r\nwas standing perfectly still, there had been a kind of possible gambol\r\nindicated in his aspect. It was quite gone now. All his youthful gayety,\r\nand with it his simplicity of manner, was eclipsed, if not utterly\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are surely ill, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Kenyon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I? Perhaps so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello indifferently; \xe2\x80\x9cI never have been\r\nill, and know not what it may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not make the poor lad fancy-sink,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miriam, pulling the\r\nsculptor\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is of a nature to lie down and die at once, if he\r\nfinds himself drawing such melancholy breaths as we ordinary people are\r\nenforced to burden our lungs withal. But we must get him away from this\r\nold, dreamy and dreary Rome, where nobody but himself ever thought of\r\nbeing gay. Its influences are too heavy to sustain the life of such a\r\ncreature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe above conversation had passed chiefly on the steps of the\r\nCappuccini; and, having said so much, Miriam lifted the leathern curtain\r\nthat hangs before all church-doors in italy. \xe2\x80\x9cHilda has forgotten her\r\nappointment,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, \xe2\x80\x9cor else her maiden slumbers are very sound\r\nthis morning. We will wait for her no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey entered the nave. The interior of the church was of moderate\r\ncompass, but of good architecture, with a vaulted roof over the nave,\r\nand a row of dusky chapels on either side of it instead of the customary\r\nside-aisles. Each chapel had its saintly shrine, hung round with\r\nofferings; its picture above the altar, although closely veiled, if by\r\nany painter of renown; and its hallowed tapers, burning continually, to\r\nset alight the devotion of the worshippers. The pavement of the nave was\r\nchiefly of marble, and looked old and broken, and was shabbily patched\r\nhere and there with tiles of brick; it was inlaid, moreover, with\r\ntombstones of the mediaeval taste, on which were quaintly sculptured\r\nborders, figures, and portraits in bas-relief, and Latin epitaphs,\r\nnow grown illegible by the tread of footsteps over them. The church\r\nappertains to a convent of Capuchin monks; and, as usually happens when\r\na reverend brotherhood have such an edifice in charge, the floor seemed\r\nnever to have been scrubbed or swept, and had as little the aspect of\r\nsanctity as a kennel; whereas, in all churches of nunneries, the maiden\r\nsisterhood invariably show the purity of their own hearts by the virgin\r\ncleanliness and visible consecration of the walls and pavement.\r\n\r\nAs our friends entered the church, their eyes rested at once on a\r\nremarkable object in the centre of the nave. It was either the actual\r\nbody, or, as might rather have been supposed at first glance, the\r\ncunningly wrought waxen face and suitably draped figure of a dead monk.\r\nThis image of wax or clay-cold reality, whichever it might be, lay on\r\na slightly elevated bier, with three tall candles burning on each side,\r\nanother tall candle at the head, and another at the foot. There was\r\nmusic, too; in harmony with so funereal a spectacle. From beneath\r\nthe pavement of the church came the deep, lugubrious strain of a De\r\nProfundis, which sounded like an utterance of the tomb itself; so\r\ndismally did it rumble through the burial vaults, and ooze up among the\r\nflat gravestones and sad epitaphs, filling the church as with a gloomy\r\nmist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must look more closely at that dead monk before we leave the church,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n remarked the sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the study of my art, I have gained many a\r\nhint from the dead which the living could never have given me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well imagine it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cOne clay image is readily\r\ncopied from another. But let us first see Guido\xe2\x80\x99s picture. The light is\r\nfavorable now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they turned into the first chapel on the right hand, as you\r\nenter the nave; and there they beheld,--not the picture, indeed,--but\r\na closely drawn curtain. The churchmen of Italy make no scruple of\r\nsacrificing the very purpose for which a work of sacred art has been\r\ncreated; that of opening the way; for religious sentiment through the\r\nquick medium of sight, by bringing angels, saints, and martyrs down\r\nvisibly upon earth; of sacrificing this high purpose, and, for aught\r\nthey know, the welfare of many souls along with it, to the hope of a\r\npaltry fee. Every work by an artist of celebrity is hidden behind a\r\nveil, and seldom revealed, except to Protestants, who scorn it as an\r\nobject of devotion, and value it only for its artistic merit.\r\n\r\nThe sacristan was quickly found, however, and lost no time in disclosing\r\nthe youthful Archangel, setting his divine foot on the head of his\r\nfallen adversary. It was an image of that greatest of future events,\r\nwhich we hope for so ardently, at least, while we are young,--but find\r\nso very long in coming, the triumph of goodness over the evil principle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere can Hilda be?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not her custom ever to\r\nfail in an engagement; and the present one was made entirely on\r\nher account. Except herself, you know, we were all agreed in our\r\nrecollection of the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we were wrong, and Hilda right, as you perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam,\r\ndirecting his attention to the point on which their dispute of the night\r\nbefore had arisen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not easy to detect her astray as regards any\r\npicture on which those clear, soft eyes of hers have ever rested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she has studied and admired few pictures so much as this,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nthe sculptor. \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder; for there is hardly another so beautiful in\r\nthe world. What an expression of heavenly severity in the Archangel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface! There is a degree of pain, trouble, and disgust at being brought\r\nin contact with sin, even for the purpose of quelling and punishing it;\r\nand yet a celestial tranquillity pervades his whole being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been able,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cto admire this picture nearly so\r\nmuch as Hilda does, in its moral and intellectual aspect. If it cost her\r\nmore trouble to be good, if her soul were less white and pure, she would\r\nbe a more competent critic of this picture, and would estimate it not\r\nhalf so high. I see its defects today more clearly than ever before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are some of them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kenyon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Archangel, now,\xe2\x80\x9d Miriam continued; \xe2\x80\x9chow fair he looks, with his\r\nunruffled wings, with his unhacked sword, and clad in his bright\r\narmor, and that exquisitely fitting sky-blue tunic, cut in the latest\r\nParadisiacal mode! What a dainty air of the first celestial society!\r\nWith what half-scornful delicacy he sets his prettily sandalled foot\r\non the head of his prostrate foe! But, is it thus that virtue looks the\r\nmoment after its death struggle with evil? No, no; I could have told\r\nGuido better. A full third of the Archangel\xe2\x80\x99s feathers should have been\r\ntorn from his wings; the rest all ruffled, till they looked like Satan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown! His sword should be streaming with blood, and perhaps broken\r\nhalfway to the hilt; his armor crushed, his robes rent, his breast gory;\r\na bleeding gash on his brow, cutting right across the stern scowl of\r\nbattle! He should press his foot hard down upon the old serpent, as\r\nif his very soul depended upon it, feeling him squirm mightily, and\r\ndoubting whether the fight were half over yet, and how the victory might\r\nturn! And, with all this fierceness, this grimness, this unutterable\r\nhorror, there should still be something high, tender, and holy in\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and around his mouth. But the battle never was such a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s play as Guido\xe2\x80\x99s dapper Archangel seems to have found it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kenyon, astonished at the wild energy\r\nof her talk; \xe2\x80\x9cpaint the picture of man\xe2\x80\x99s struggle against sin according\r\nto your own idea! I think it will be a masterpiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe picture would have its share of truth, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I am sadly afraid the victory would fail on the wrong side. Just\r\nfancy a smoke-blackened, fiery-eyed demon bestriding that nice young\r\nangel, clutching his white throat with one of his hinder claws; and\r\ngiving a triumphant whisk of his scaly tail, with a poisonous dart at\r\nthe end of it! That is what they risk, poor souls, who do battle with\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt now, perhaps, struck Miriam that her mental disquietude was impelling\r\nher to an undue vivacity; for she paused, and turned away from the\r\npicture, without saying a word more about it. All this while, moreover,\r\nDonatello had been very ill at ease, casting awe-stricken and inquiring\r\nglances at the dead monk; as if he could look nowhere but at that\r\nghastly object, merely because it shocked him. Death has probably a\r\npeculiar horror and ugliness, when forced upon the contemplation of a\r\nperson so naturally joyous as Donatello, who lived with completeness in\r\nthe present moment, and was able to form but vague images of the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Donatello?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Miriam soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nquite in a tremble, my poor friend! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis awful chant from beneath the church,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Donatello; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\noppresses me; the air is so heavy with it that I can scarcely draw my\r\nbreath. And yonder dead monk! I feel as if he were lying right across my\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake courage!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered she again \xe2\x80\x9ccome, we will approach close to\r\nthe dead monk. The only way, in such cases, is to stare the ugly horror\r\nright in the face; never a sidelong glance, nor half-look, for those are\r\nwhat show a frightfull thing in its frightfullest aspect. Lean on me,\r\ndearest friend! My heart is very strong for both of us. Be brave; and\r\nall is well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello hung back for a moment, but then pressed close to Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, and suffered her to lead him up to the bier. The sculptor\r\nfollowed. A number of persons, chiefly women, with several children\r\namong them, were standing about the corpse; and as our three friends\r\ndrew nigh, a mother knelt down, and caused her little boy to kneel,\r\nboth kissing the beads and crucifix that hung from the monk\xe2\x80\x99s girdle.\r\nPossibly he had died in the odor of sanctity; or, at all events, death\r\nand his brown frock and cowl made a sacred image of this reverend\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEAD CAPUCHIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dead monk was clad, as when alive, in the brown woollen frock of\r\nthe Capuchins, with the hood drawn over his head, but so as to leave the\r\nfeatures and a portion of the beard uncovered. His rosary and cross hung\r\nat his side; his hands were folded over his breast; his feet (he was of\r\na barefooted order in his lifetime, and continued so in death) protruded\r\nfrom beneath his habit, stiff and stark, with a more waxen look than\r\neven his face. They were tied together at the ankles with a black\r\nribbon.\r\n\r\nThe countenance, as we have already said, was fully displayed. It had a\r\npurplish hue upon it, unlike the paleness of an ordinary corpse, but\r\nas little resembling the flush of natural life. The eyelids were\r\nbut partially drawn down, and showed the eyeballs beneath; as if the\r\ndeceased friar were stealing a glimpse at the bystanders, to watch\r\nwhether they were duly impressed with the solemnity of his obsequies.\r\nThe shaggy eyebrows gave sternness to the look. Miriam passed between\r\ntwo of the lighted candles, and stood close beside the bier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe grasped Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and, at the same instant, felt him give a\r\nconvulsive shudder, which she knew to have been caused by a sudden\r\nand terrible throb of the heart. His hand, by an instantaneous change,\r\nbecame like ice within hers, which likewise grew so icy that their\r\ninsensible fingers might have rattled, one against the other. No wonder\r\nthat their blood curdled; no wonder that their hearts leaped and paused!\r\nThe dead face of the monk, gazing at them beneath its half-closed\r\neyelids, was the same visage that had glared upon their naked souls, the\r\npast midnight, as Donatello flung him over the precipice.\r\n\r\nThe sculptor was standing at the foot of the bier, and had not yet seen\r\nthe monk\xe2\x80\x99s features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose naked feet!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI know not why, but they affect me\r\nstrangely. They have walked to and fro over the hard pavements of Rome,\r\nand through a hundred other rough ways of this life, where the monk went\r\nbegging for his brotherhood; along the cloisters and dreary corridors\r\nof his convent, too, from his youth upward! It is a suggestive idea, to\r\ntrack those worn feet backward through all the paths they have trodden,\r\never since they were the tender and rosy little feet of a baby, and\r\n(cold as they now are) were kept warm in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs his companions, whom the sculptor supposed to be close by him, made\r\nno response to his fanciful musing, he looked up, and saw them at the\r\nhead of the bier. He advanced thither himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he.\r\n\r\nHe cast a horror-stricken and bewildered glance at Miriam, but withdrew\r\nit immediately. Not that he had any definite suspicion, or, it may be,\r\neven a remote idea, that she could be held responsible in the least\r\ndegree for this man\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death. In truth, it seemed too wild a\r\nthought to connect, in reality, Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s persecutor of many past months\r\nand the vagabond of the preceding night, with the dead Capuchin\r\nof to-day. It resembled one of those unaccountable changes and\r\ninterminglings of identity, which so often occur among the personages\r\nof a dream. But Kenyon, as befitted the professor of an imaginative art,\r\nwas endowed with an exceedingly quick sensibility, which was apt to give\r\nhim intimations of the true state of matters that lay beyond his actual\r\nvision. There was a whisper in his ear; it said, \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d Without asking\r\nhimself wherefore, he resolved to be silent as regarded the mysterious\r\ndiscovery which he had made, and to leave any remark or exclamation\r\nto be voluntarily offered by Miriam. If she never spoke, then let the\r\nriddle be unsolved.\r\n\r\nAnd now occurred a circumstance that would seem too fantastic to be\r\ntold, if it had not actually happened, precisely as we set it down. As\r\nthe three friends stood by the bier, they saw that a little stream of\r\nblood had begun to ooze from the dead monk\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils; it crept slowly\r\ntowards the thicket of his beard, where, in the course of a moment or\r\ntwo, it hid itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe monk died of apoplexy, I suppose,\r\nor by some sudden accident, and the blood has not yet congealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you consider that a sufficient explanation?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam, with a\r\nsmile from which the sculptor involuntarily turned away his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes\r\nit satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you know the old superstition about this phenomenon of blood\r\nflowing from a dead body,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we tell but that the\r\nmurderer of this monk (or, possibly, it may be only that privileged\r\nmurderer, his physician) may have just entered the church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot jest about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kenyon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an ugly sight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true; horrible to see, or dream of!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with one of\r\nthose long, tremulous sighs, which so often betray a sick heart by\r\nescaping unexpectedly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not look at it any more. Come away,\r\nDonatello. Let us escape from this dismal church. The sunshine will do\r\nyou good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen had ever a woman such a trial to sustain as this! By no possible\r\nsupposition could Miriam explain the identity of the dead Capuchin,\r\nquietly and decorously laid out in the nave of his convent church, with\r\nthat of her murdered persecutor, flung heedlessly at the foot of the\r\nprecipice. The effect upon her imagination was as if a strange and\r\nunknown corpse had miraculously, while she was gazing at it, assumed the\r\nlikeness of that face, so terrible henceforth in her remembrance. It was\r\na symbol, perhaps, of the deadly iteration with which she was doomed\r\nto behold the image of her crime reflected back upon her in a thousand\r\nways, and converting the great, calm face of Nature, in the whole, and\r\nin its innumerable details, into a manifold reminiscence of that one\r\ndead visage.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Miriam turned away from the bier, and gone a few steps,\r\nthan she fancied the likeness altogether an illusion, which would vanish\r\nat a closer and colder view. She must look at it again, therefore, and\r\nat once; or else the grave would close over the face, and leave the\r\nawful fantasy that had connected itself therewith fixed ineffaceably in\r\nher brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for me, one moment!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her companions. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she went back, and gazed once more at the corpse. Yes; these were\r\nthe features that Miriam had known so well; this was the visage that she\r\nremembered from a far longer date than the most intimate of her friends\r\nsuspected; this form of clay had held the evil spirit which blasted her\r\nsweet youth, and compelled her, as it were, to stain her womanhood\r\nwith crime. But, whether it were the majesty of death, or something\r\noriginally noble and lofty in the character of the dead, which the soul\r\nhad stamped upon the features, as it left them; so it was that Miriam\r\nnow quailed and shook, not for the vulgar horror of the spectacle, but\r\nfor the severe, reproachful glance that seemed to come from between\r\nthose half-closed lids. True, there had been nothing, in his lifetime,\r\nviler than this man. She knew it; there was no other fact within her\r\nconsciousness that she felt to be so certain; and yet, because her\r\npersecutor found himself safe and irrefutable in death, he frowned upon\r\nhis victim, and threw back the blame on her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it thou, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, under her breath. \xe2\x80\x9cThen thou hast\r\nno right to scowl upon me so! But art thou real, or a vision?\xe2\x80\x9d She bent\r\ndown over the dead monk, till one of her rich curls brushed against his\r\nforehead. She touched one of his folded hands with her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the scar, that I know so well, on his\r\nbrow. And it is no vision; he is palpable to my touch! I will question\r\nthe fact no longer, but deal with it as I best can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to see how the crisis developed in Miriam its own\r\nproper strength, and the faculty of sustaining the demands which it made\r\nupon her fortitude. She ceased to tremble; the beautiful woman gazed\r\nsternly at her dead enemy, endeavoring to meet and quell the look of\r\naccusation that he threw from between his half-closed eyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; thou shalt not scowl me down!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither now, nor when\r\nwe stand together at the judgment-seat. I fear not to meet thee there.\r\nFarewell, till that next encounter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaughtily waving her hand, Miriam rejoined her friends, who were\r\nawaiting her at the door of the church. As they went out, the sacristan\r\nstopped them, and proposed to show the cemetery of the convent, where\r\nthe deceased members of the fraternity are laid to rest in sacred earth,\r\nbrought long ago from Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will yonder monk be buried there?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother Antonio?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sacristan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, our good brother will be put to bed there! His grave is already\r\ndug, and the last occupant has made room for him. Will you look at it,\r\nsignorina?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Kenyon; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I shall leave you. One dead monk\r\nhas more than sufficed me; and I am not bold enough to face the whole\r\nmortality of the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see, by Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s looks, that he, as well as the\r\nsculptor, would gladly have escaped a visit to the famous cemetery of\r\nthe Cappuccini. But Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s nerves were strained to such a pitch, that\r\nshe anticipated a certain solace and absolute relief in passing from\r\none ghastly spectacle to another of long-accumulated ugliness; and there\r\nwas, besides, a singular sense of duty which impelled her to look at\r\nthe final resting-place of the being whose fate had been so disastrously\r\ninvolved with her own. She therefore followed the sacristan\xe2\x80\x99s guidance,\r\nand drew her companion along with her, whispering encouragement as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery is beneath the church, but entirely above ground, and\r\nlighted by a row of iron-grated windows without glass. A corridor runs\r\nalong beside these windows, and gives access to three or four vaulted\r\nrecesses, or chapels, of considerable breadth and height, the floor of\r\nwhich consists of the consecrated earth of Jerusalem. It is smoothed\r\ndecorously over the deceased brethren of the convent, and is kept\r\nquite free from grass or weeds, such as would grow even in these gloomy\r\nrecesses, if pains were not bestowed to root them up. But, as the\r\ncemetery is small, and it is a precious privilege to sleep in holy\r\nground, the brotherhood are immemorially accustomed, when one of their\r\nnumber dies, to take the longest buried skeleton out of the oldest\r\ngrave, and lay the new slumberer there instead. Thus, each of the good\r\nfriars, in his turn, enjoys the luxury of a consecrated bed, attended\r\nwith the slight drawback of being forced to get up long before daybreak,\r\nas it were, and make room for another lodger.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the unearthed skeletons is what makes the special\r\ninterest of the cemetery. The arched and vaulted walls of the burial\r\nrecesses are supported by massive pillars and pilasters made of\r\nthigh-bones and skulls; the whole material of the structure appears\r\nto be of a similar kind; and the knobs and embossed ornaments of this\r\nstrange architecture are represented by the joints of the spine, and\r\nthe more delicate tracery by the Smaller bones of the human frame. The\r\nsummits of the arches are adorned with entire skeletons, looking as if\r\nthey were wrought most skilfully in bas-relief. There is no possibility\r\nof describing how ugly and grotesque is the effect, combined with a\r\ncertain artistic merit, nor how much perverted ingenuity has been shown\r\nin this queer way, nor what a multitude of dead monks, through how many\r\nhundred years, must have contributed their bony framework to build\r\nup these great arches of mortality. On some of the skulls there are\r\ninscriptions, purporting that such a monk, who formerly made use of\r\nthat particular headpiece, died on such a day and year; but vastly the\r\ngreater number are piled up indistinguishably into the architectural\r\ndesign, like the many deaths that make up the one glory of a victory.\r\n\r\nIn the side walls of the vaults are niches where skeleton monks sit or\r\nstand, clad in the brown habits that they wore in life, and labelled\r\nwith their names and the dates of their decease. Their skulls (some\r\nquite bare, and others still covered with yellow skin, and hair that\r\nhas known the earth-damps) look out from beneath their hoods, grinning\r\nhideously repulsive. One reverend father has his mouth wide open, as if\r\nhe had died in the midst of a howl of terror and remorse, which perhaps\r\nis even now screeching through eternity. As a general thing, however,\r\nthese frocked and hooded skeletons seem to take a more cheerful view of\r\ntheir position, and try with ghastly smiles to turn it into a jest. But\r\nthe cemetery of the Capuchins is no place to nourish celestial hopes:\r\nthe soul sinks forlorn and wretched under all this burden of dusty\r\ndeath; the holy earth from Jerusalem, so imbued is it with mortality,\r\nhas grown as barren of the flowers of Paradise as it is of earthly weeds\r\nand grass. Thank Heaven for its blue sky; it needs a long, upward gaze\r\nto give us back our faith. Not here can we feel ourselves immortal,\r\nwhere the very altars in these chapels of horrible consecration are\r\nheaps of human bones.\r\n\r\nYet let us give the cemetery the praise that it deserves. There is no\r\ndisagreeable scent, such as might have been expected from the decay of\r\nso many holy persons, in whatever odor of sanctity they may have taken\r\ntheir departure. The same number of living monks would not smell half so\r\nunexceptionably.\r\n\r\nMiriam went gloomily along the corridor, from one vaulted Golgotha to\r\nanother, until in the farthest recess she beheld an open grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that for him who lies yonder in the nave?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, signorina, this is to be the resting-place of Brother Antonio, who\r\ncame to his death last night,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sacristan; \xe2\x80\x9cand in yonder\r\nniche, you see, sits a brother who was buried thirty years ago, and has\r\nrisen to give him place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a satisfactory idea,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you poor friars\r\ncannot call even your graves permanently your own. You must lie down\r\nin them, methinks, with a nervous anticipation of being disturbed, like\r\nweary men who know that they shall be summoned out of bed at midnight.\r\nIs it not possible (if money were to be paid for the privilege) to leave\r\nBrother Antonio--if that be his name--in the occupancy of that narrow\r\ngrave till the last trumpet sounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, signorina; neither is it needful or desirable,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe sacristan. \xe2\x80\x9cA quarter of a century\xe2\x80\x99s sleep in the sweet earth\r\nof Jerusalem is better than a thousand years in any other soil. Our\r\nbrethren find good rest there. No ghost was ever known to steal out of\r\nthis blessed cemetery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cmay he whom you now lay to sleep\r\nprove no exception to the rule!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they left the cemetery she put money into the sacristan\xe2\x80\x99s hand to an\r\namount that made his eyes open wide and glisten, and requested that it\r\nmight be expended in masses for the repose of Father Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICI GARDENS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam anxiously, as they came through the Piazza\r\nBarberini, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can I do for you, my beloved friend? You are shaking as\r\nwith the cold fit of the Roman fever.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello; \xe2\x80\x9cmy heart\r\nshivers.\xe2\x80\x9d As soon as she could collect her thoughts, Miriam led the\r\nyoung man to the gardens of the Villa Medici, hoping that the quiet\r\nshade and sunshine of that delightful retreat would a little revive his\r\nspirits. The grounds are there laid out in the old fashion of straight\r\npaths, with borders of box, which form hedges of great height and\r\ndensity, and are shorn and trimmed to the evenness of a wall of\r\nstone, at the top and sides. There are green alleys, with long vistas\r\novershadowed by ilex-trees; and at each intersection of the paths, the\r\nvisitor finds seats of lichen-covered stone to repose upon, and marble\r\nstatues that look forlornly at him, regretful of their lost noses. In\r\nthe more open portions of the garden, before the sculptured front of\r\nthe villa, you see fountains and flower-beds, and in their season\r\na profusion of roses, from which the genial sun of Italy distils a\r\nfragrance, to be scattered abroad by the no less genial breeze.\r\n\r\nBut Donatello drew no delight from these things. He walked onward in\r\nsilent apathy, and looked at Miriam with strangely half-awakened and\r\nbewildered eyes, when she sought to bring his mind into sympathy with\r\nhers, and so relieve his heart of the burden that lay lumpishly upon it.\r\n\r\nShe made him sit down on a stone bench, where two embowered alleys\r\ncrossed each other; so that they could discern the approach of any\r\ncasual intruder a long way down the path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sweet friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking one of his passive hands in both of\r\nhers, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can I say to comfort you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Donatello, with sombre reserve. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing will ever\r\ncomfort me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept my own misery,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miriam, \xe2\x80\x9cmy own guilt, if guilt it\r\nbe; and, whether guilt or misery, I shall know how to deal with it. But\r\nyou, dearest friend, that were the rarest creature in all this world,\r\nand seemed a being to whom sorrow could not cling,--you, whom I\r\nhalf fancied to belong to a race that had vanished forever, you only\r\nsurviving, to show mankind how genial and how joyous life used to be, in\r\nsome long-gone age,--what had you to do with grief or crime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey came to me as to other men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello broodingly. \xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless\r\nI was born to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; they came with me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cMine is the\r\nresponsibility! Alas! wherefore was I born? Why did we ever meet? Why\r\ndid I not drive you from me, knowing for my heart foreboded it--that the\r\ncloud in which I walked would likewise envelop you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonatello stirred uneasily, with the irritable impatience that is often\r\ncombined With a mood of leaden despondency. A brown lizard with two\r\ntails--a monster often engendered by the Roman sunshine--ran across his\r\nfoot, and made him start. Then he sat silent awhile, and so did Miriam,\r\ntrying to dissolve her whole heart into sympathy, and lavish it all upon\r\nhim, were it only for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s cordial.\r\n\r\nThe young man lifted his hand to his breast, and, unintentionally, as\r\nMiriam\xe2\x80\x99s hand was within his, he lifted that along with it. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\r\ngreat weight here!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. The fancy struck Miriam (but she drove it\r\nresolutely down) that Donatello almost imperceptibly shuddered, while,\r\nin pressing his own hand against his heart, he pressed hers there too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest your heart on me, dearest one!\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me bear all its\r\nweight; I am well able to bear it; for I am a woman, and I love you! I\r\nlove you, Donatello! Is there no comfort for you in this avowal? Look\r\nat me! Heretofore you have found me pleasant to your sight. Gaze into my\r\neyes! Gaze into my soul! Search as deeply as you may, you can never see\r\nhalf the tenderness and devotion that I henceforth cherish for you. All\r\nthat I ask is your acceptance of the utter self-sacrifice (but it shall\r\nbe no sacrifice, to my great love) with which I seek to remedy the evil\r\nyou have incurred for my sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this fervor on Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s part; on Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s, a heavy silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, speak to me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly promise me to be, by and by, a\r\nlittle happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Donatello. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, never again! never again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever? Ah, that is a terrible word to say to me!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nterrible word to let fall upon a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, when she loves you, and\r\nis conscious of having caused your misery! If you love me, Donatello,\r\nspeak it not again. And surely you did love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Donatello gloomily and absently.\r\n\r\nMiriam released the young man\xe2\x80\x99s hand, but suffered one of her own to\r\nlie close to his, and waited a moment to see whether he would make\r\nany effort to retain it. There was much depending upon that simple\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nWith a deep sigh--as when, sometimes, a slumberer turns over in a\r\ntroubled dream Donatello changed his position, and clasped both his\r\nhands over his forehead. The genial warmth of a Roman April kindling\r\ninto May was in the atmosphere around them; but when Miriam saw\r\nthat involuntary movement and heard that sigh of relief (for so she\r\ninterpreted it), a shiver ran through her frame, as if the iciest wind\r\nof the Apennines were blowing over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has done himself a greater wrong than I dreamed of,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she,\r\nwith unutterable compassion. \xe2\x80\x9cAlas! it was a sad mistake! He might\r\nhave had a kind of bliss in the consequences of this deed, had he been\r\nimpelled to it by a love vital enough to survive the frenzy of that\r\nterrible moment, mighty enough to make its own law, and justify itself\r\nagainst the natural remorse. But to have perpetrated a dreadful murder\r\n(and such was his crime, unless love, annihilating moral distinctions,\r\nmade it otherwise) on no better warrant than a boy\xe2\x80\x99s idle fantasy! I\r\npity him from the very depths of my soul! As for myself, I am past my\r\nown or other\xe2\x80\x99s pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe arose from the young man\xe2\x80\x99s side, and stood before him with a sad,\r\ncommiserating aspect; it was the look of a ruined soul, bewailing,\r\nin him, a grief less than what her profounder sympathies imposed upon\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonatello, we must part,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with melancholy firmness. \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\r\nleave me! Go back to your old tower, which overlooks the green valley\r\nyou have told me of among the Apennines. Then, all that has passed will\r\nbe recognized as but an ugly dream. For in dreams the conscience sleeps,\r\nand we often stain ourselves with guilt of which we should be incapable\r\nin our waking moments. The deed you seemed to do, last night, was\r\nno more than such a dream; there was as little substance in what you\r\nfancied yourself doing. Go; and forget it all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that terrible face!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello, pressing his hands over his\r\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you call that unreal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; for you beheld it with dreaming eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nunreal; and, that you may feel it so, it is requisite that you see this\r\nface of mine no more. Once, you may have thought it beautiful; now, it\r\nhas lost its charm. Yet it would still retain a miserable potency\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nbring back the past illusion, and, in its train, the remorse and anguish\r\nthat would darken all your life. Leave me, therefore, and forget me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget you, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello, roused somewhat from his apathy of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could remember you, and behold you, apart from that frightful\r\nvisage which stares at me over your shoulder, that were a consolation,\r\nat least, if not a joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut since that visage haunts you along with mine,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam,\r\nglancing behind her, \xe2\x80\x9cwe needs must part. Farewell, then! But if\r\never--in distress, peril, shame, poverty, or whatever anguish is most\r\npoignant, whatever burden heaviest--you should require a life to be\r\ngiven wholly, only to make your own a little easier, then summon me! As\r\nthe case now stands between us, you have bought me dear, and find me of\r\nlittle worth. Fling me away, therefore! May you never need me more! But,\r\nif otherwise, a wish--almost an unuttered wish will bring me to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood a moment, expecting a reply. But Donatello\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had again\r\nfallen on the ground, and he had not, in his bewildered mind and\r\noverburdened heart, a word to respond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat hour I speak of may never come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nfarewell--farewell forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donatello.\r\n\r\nHis voice hardly made its way through the environment of unaccustomed\r\nthoughts and emotions which had settled over him like a dense and dark\r\ncloud. Not improbably, he beheld Miriam through so dim a medium that she\r\nlooked visionary; heard her speak only in a thin, faint echo.\r\n\r\nShe turned from the young man, and, much as her heart yearned towards\r\nhim, she would not profane that heavy parting by an embrace, or even a\r\npressure of the hand. So soon after the semblance of such mighty love,\r\nand after it had been the impulse to so terrible a deed, they parted,\r\nin all outward show, as coldly as people part whose whole mutual\r\nintercourse has been encircled within a single hour.\r\n\r\nAnd Donatello, when Miriam had departed, stretched himself at full\r\nlength on the stone bench, and drew his hat over his eyes, as the idle\r\nand light-hearted youths of dreamy Italy are accustomed to do, when they\r\nlie down in the first convenient shade, and snatch a noonday slumber.\r\nA stupor was upon him, which he mistook for such drowsiness as he had\r\nknown in his innocent past life. But, by and by, he raised himself\r\nslowly and left the garden. Sometimes poor Donatello started, as if\r\nhe heard a shriek; sometimes he shrank back, as if a face, fearful to\r\nbehold, were thrust close to his own. In this dismal mood, bewildered\r\nwith the novelty of sin and grief, he had little left of that singular\r\nresemblance, on account of which, and for their sport, his three friends\r\nhad fantastically recognized him as the veritable Faun of Praxiteles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRIAM AND HILDA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Medici Gardens Miriam felt herself astray in the world;\r\nand having no special reason to seek one place more than another, she\r\nsuffered chance to direct her steps as it would. Thus it happened, that,\r\ninvolving herself in the crookedness of Rome, she saw Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s tower\r\nrising before her, and was put in mind to climb to the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyry, and ask why she had broken her engagement at the church of the\r\nCapuchins. People often do the idlest acts of their lifetime in their\r\nheaviest and most anxious moments; so that it would have been no wonder\r\nhad Miriam been impelled only by so slight a motive of curiosity as we\r\nhave indicated. But she remembered, too, and with a quaking heart, what\r\nthe sculptor had mentioned of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s retracing her steps towards the\r\ncourtyard of the Palazzo Caffarelli in quest of Miriam herself. Had she\r\nbeen compelled to choose between infamy in the eyes of the whole world,\r\nor in Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s eyes alone, she would unhesitatingly have accepted the\r\nformer, on condition of remaining spotless in the estimation of her\r\nwhite-souled friend. This possibility, therefore, that Hilda had\r\nwitnessed the scene of the past night, was unquestionably the cause\r\nthat drew Miriam to the tower, and made her linger and falter as she\r\napproached it.\r\n\r\nAs she drew near, there were tokens to which her disturbed mind gave a\r\nsinister interpretation. Some of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s airy family, the doves,\r\nwith their heads imbedded disconsolately in their bosoms, were huddled\r\nin a corner of the piazza; others had alighted on the heads, wings,\r\nshoulders, and trumpets of the marble angels which adorned the facade\r\nof the neighboring church; two or three had betaken themselves to the\r\nVirgin\xe2\x80\x99s shrine; and as many as could find room were sitting on Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindow-sill. But all of them, so Miriam fancied, had a look of weary\r\nexpectation and disappointment, no flights, no flutterings, no cooing\r\nmurmur; something that ought to have made their day glad and bright\r\nwas evidently left out of this day\xe2\x80\x99s history. And, furthermore, Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhite window-curtain was closely drawn, with only that one little\r\naperture at the side, which Miriam remembered noticing the night before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam to her own heart, pressing her hand hard upon\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldst thou throb now? Hast thou not endured more terrible\r\nthings than this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever were her apprehensions, she would not turn back. It might\r\nbe--and the solace would be worth a world--that Hilda, knowing nothing\r\nof the past night\xe2\x80\x99s calamity, would greet her friend with a sunny smile,\r\nand so restore a portion of the vital warmth, for lack of which her soul\r\nwas frozen. But could Miriam, guilty as she was, permit Hilda to kiss\r\nher cheek, to clasp her hand, and thus be no longer so unspotted from\r\nthe world as heretofore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never permit her sweet touch again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miriam, toiling up\r\nthe staircase, \xe2\x80\x9cif I can find strength of heart to forbid it. But, O! it\r\nwould be so soothing in this wintry fever-fit of my heart. There can be\r\nno harm to my white Hilda in one parting kiss. That shall be all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, on reaching the upper landing-place, Miriam paused, and stirred not\r\nagain till she had brought herself to an immovable resolve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lips, my hand, shall never meet Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s more,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hilda sat listlessly in her painting-room. Had you looked\r\ninto the little adjoining chamber, you might have seen the slight\r\nimprint of her figure on the bed, but would also have detected at once\r\nthat the white counterpane had not been turned down. The pillow was more\r\ndisturbed; she had turned her face upon it, the poor child, and bedewed\r\nit with some of those tears (among the most chill and forlorn that gush\r\nfrom human sorrow) which the innocent heart pours forth at its first\r\nactual discovery that sin is in the world. The young and pure are not\r\napt to find out that miserable truth until it is brought home to them by\r\nthe guiltiness of some trusted friend. They may have heard much of\r\nthe evil of the world, and seem to know it, but only as an impalpable\r\ntheory. In due time, some mortal, whom they reverence too highly,\r\nis commissioned by Providence to teach them this direful lesson; he\r\nperpetrates a sin; and Adam falls anew, and Paradise, heretofore in\r\nunfaded bloom, is lost again, and dosed forever, with the fiery swords\r\ngleaming at its gates.\r\n\r\nThe chair in which Hilda sat was near the portrait of Beatrice Cenci,\r\nwhich had not yet been taken from the easel. It is a peculiarity of\r\nthis picture, that its profoundest expression eludes a straightforward\r\nglance, and can only be caught by side glimpses, or when the eye\r\nfalls casually upon it; even as if the painted face had a life and\r\nconsciousness of its own, and, resolving not to betray its secret of\r\ngrief or guilt, permitted the true tokens to come forth only when it\r\nimagined itself unseen. No other such magical effect has ever been\r\nwrought by pencil.\r\n\r\nNow, opposite the easel hung a looking-glass, in which Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nand Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s were both reflected. In one of her weary, nerveless changes\r\nof position, Hilda happened to throw her eyes on the glass, and took in\r\nboth these images at one unpremeditated glance. She fancied--nor was it\r\nwithout horror--that Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s expression, seen aside and vanishing in\r\na moment, had been depicted in her own face likewise, and flitted from\r\nit as timorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I, too, stained with guilt?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the poor girl, hiding her face\r\nin her hands.\r\n\r\nNot so, thank Heaven! But, as regards Beatrice\xe2\x80\x99s picture, the incident\r\nsuggests a theory which may account for its unutterable grief and\r\nmysterious shadow of guilt, without detracting from the purity which we\r\nlove to attribute to that ill-fated girl. Who, indeed, can look at that\r\nmouth,--with its lips half apart, as innocent as a babe\xe2\x80\x99s that has\r\nbeen crying, and not pronounce Beatrice sinless? It was the intimate\r\nconsciousness of her father\xe2\x80\x99s sin that threw its shadow over her, and\r\nfrightened her into a remote and inaccessible region, where no sympathy\r\ncould come. It was the knowledge of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s guilt that lent the same\r\nexpression to Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nBut Hilda nervously moved her chair, so that the images in the glass\r\nshould be no longer Visible. She now watched a speck of sunshine that\r\ncame through a shuttered window, and crept from object to object,\r\nindicating each with a touch of its bright finger, and then letting them\r\nall vanish successively. In like manner her mind, so like sunlight\r\nin its natural cheerfulness, went from thought to thought, but found\r\nnothing that it could dwell upon for comfort. Never before had this\r\nyoung, energetic, active spirit known what it is to be despondent. It\r\nwas the unreality of the world that made her so. Her dearest friend,\r\nwhose heart seemed the most solid and richest of Hilda\xe2\x80\x99s possessions,\r\nhad no existence for her any more; and in that dreary void, out of which\r\nMiriam had disappeared, the substance, the truth, the integrity of life,\r\nthe motives of effort, the joy of success, had departed along with her.\r\n\r\nIt was long past noon, when a step came up the staircase. It had passed\r\nbeyond the limits where there was communication with the lower regions\r\nof the palace, and was mounting the successive flights which led only to\r\nHilda\xe2\x80\x99s precincts. Faint as the tread was, she heard and recognized it.\r\nIt startled her into sudden life. Her first impulse was to spring to\r\nthe door of the studio, and fasten it with lock and bolt. But a second\r\nthought made her feel that this would be an unworthy cowardice, on her\r\nown part, and also that Miriam--only yesterday her closest friend had\r\na right to be told, face to face, that thenceforth they must be forever\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nShe heard Miriam pause, outside of the door. We have already seen what\r\nwas the latter\xe2\x80\x99s resolve with respect to any kiss or pressure of\r\nthe hand between Hilda and herself. We know not what became of the\r\nresolution. As Miriam was of a highly impulsive character, it may have\r\nvanished at the first sight of Hilda; but, at all events, she appeared\r\nto have dressed herself up in a garb of sunshine, and was disclosed, as\r\nthe door swung open, in all the glow of her remarkable beauty. The truth\r\nwas, her heart leaped conclusively towards the only refuge that it had,\r\nor hoped. She forgot, just one instant, all cause for holding herself\r\naloof. Ordinarily there was a certain reserve in Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrations\r\nof affection, in consonance with the delicacy of her friend. To-day, she\r\nopened her arms to take Hilda in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest, darling Hilda!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives me new life to see\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHilda was standing in the middle of the room. When her friend made a\r\nstep or two from the door, she put forth her hands with an involuntary\r\nrepellent gesture, so expressive that Miriam at once felt a great chasm\r\nopening itself between them two. They might gaze at one another from the\r\nopposite side, but without the possibility of ever meeting more; or, at\r\nleast, since the chasm could never be bridged over, they must tread\r\nthe whole round of Eternity to meet on the other side. There was even\r\na terror in the thought of their meeting again. It was as if Hilda or\r\nMiriam were dead, and could no longer hold intercourse without violating\r\na spiritual law.\r\n\r\nYet, in the wantonness of her despair, Miriam made one more step towards\r\nthe friend whom she had lost. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not come nearer, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHilda. Her look and tone were those of sorrowful entreaty, and yet\r\nthey expressed a kind of confidence, as if the girl were conscious of a\r\nsafeguard that could not be violated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened between us, Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we not\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least we have been friends,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Miriam. \xe2\x80\x9cI loved you dearly!\r\nI love you still! You were to me as a younger sister; yes, dearer than\r\nsisters of the same blood; for you and I were so lonely, Hilda, that the\r\nwhole world pressed us together by its solitude and strangeness. Then,\r\nwill you not touch my hand? Am I not the same as yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! no, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the same, the same for you, Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined her lost friend.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you to touch my hand, you would find it as warm to your grasp as\r\never. If you were sick or suffering, I would watch night and day for\r\nyou. It is in such simple offices that true affection shows itself;\r\nand so I speak of them. Yet now, Hilda, your very look seems to put me\r\nbeyond the limits of human kind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not I, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda; \xe2\x80\x9cnot I that have done this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, and you only, Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miriam, stirred up to make her own\r\ncause good by the repellent force which her friend opposed to her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\na woman, as I was yesterday; endowed with the same truth of nature, the\r\nsame warmth of heart, the same genuine and earnest love, which you\r\nhave always known in me. In any regard that concerns yourself, I am not\r\nchanged. And believe me, Hilda, when a human being has chosen a friend\r\nout of all the world, it is only some faithlessness between themselves,\r\nrendering true intercourse impossible, that can justify either friend in\r\nsevering the bond. Have I deceived you? Then cast me off! Have I wronged\r\nyou personally? Then forgive me, if you can. But, have I sinned against\r\nGod and man, and deeply sinned? Then be more my friend than ever, for I\r\nneed you more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not bewilder me thus, Miriam!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Hilda, who had not forborne\r\nto express, by look and gesture, the anguish which this interview\r\ninflicted on her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were one of God\xe2\x80\x99s angels, with a nature\r\nincapable of stain, and garments that never could be spotted, I would\r\nkeep ever at your side, and try to lead you upward. But I am a poor,\r\nlonely girl, whom God has set here in an evil world, and given her only\r\na white robe, and bid her wear it back to Him, as white as when she put\r\nit on. Your powerful magnetism would be too much for me. The pure, white\r\natmosphere, in which I try to discern what things are good and true,\r\nwould be discolored. And therefore, Miriam, before it is too late, I\r\nmean to put faith in this awful heartquake which warns me henceforth to\r\navoid you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, this is hard! Ah, this is terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Miriam, dropping her\r\nforehead in her hands. In a moment or two she looked up again, as pale\r\nas death, but with a composed countenance: \xe2\x80\x9cI always said, Hilda, that\r\nyou were merciless; for I had a perception of it, even while you\r\nloved me best. You have no sin, nor any conception of what it is; and\r\ntherefore you are so terribly severe! As an angel, you are not amiss;\r\nbut, as a human creature, and a woman among earthly men and women, you\r\nneed a sin to soften you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, \xe2\x80\x9cif I have said a needlessly cruel word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it pass,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Miriam; \xe2\x80\x9cI, whose heart it has smitten upon,\r\nforgive you. And tell me, before we part forever, what have you seen or\r\nknown of me, since we last met?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA terrible thing, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, growing paler than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see it written in my face, or painted in my eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nMiriam, her trouble seeking relief in a half-frenzied raillery. \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nfain know how it is that Providence, or fate, brings eye-witnesses to\r\nwatch us, when we fancy ourselves acting in the remotest privacy. Did\r\nall Rome see it, then? Or, at least, our merry company of artists? Or is\r\nit some blood-stain on me, or death-scent in my garments? They say that\r\nmonstrous deformities sprout out of fiends, who once were lovely angels.\r\nDo you perceive such in me already? Tell me, by our past friendship,\r\nHilda, all you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus adjured, and frightened by the wild emotion which Miriam could not\r\nsuppress, Hilda strove to tell what she had witnessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the rest of the party had passed on, I went back to speak to\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cfor there seemed to be a trouble on your mind, and I\r\nwished to share it with you, if you could permit me. The door of the\r\nlittle courtyard was partly shut; but I pushed it open, and saw you\r\nwithin, and Donatello, and a third person, whom I had before noticed in\r\nthe shadow of a niche. He approached you, Miriam. You knelt to him! I\r\nsaw Donatello spring upon him! I would have shrieked, but my throat\r\nwas dry. I would have rushed forward, but my limbs seemed rooted to the\r\nearth. It was like a flash of lightning. A look passed from your eyes to\r\nDonatello\xe2\x80\x99s--a look.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Hilda, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miriam, with intense\r\neagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not pause now! That look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt revealed all your heart, Miriam,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Hilda, covering her\r\neyes as if to shut out the recollection; \xe2\x80\x9ca look of hatred, triumph,\r\nvengeance, and, as it were, joy at some unhoped-for relief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Donatello was right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Miriam, who shook throughout\r\nall her frame. \xe2\x80\x9cMy eyes bade him do it! Go on, Hilda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all passed so quickly, all like a glare of lightning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand yet it seemed to me that Donatello had paused, while one might draw\r\na breath. But that look! Ah, Miriam, spare me. Need I tell more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more; there needs no more, Hilda,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miriam, bowing her head,\r\nas if listening to a sentence of condemnation from a supreme tribunal.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough! You have satisfied my mind on a point where it was\r\ngreatly disturbed. Henceforward I shall be quiet. Thank you, Hilda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was on the point of departing, but turned back again from the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a terrible secret to be kept in a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s bosom,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nobserved; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will you do with it, my poor child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven help and guide me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hilda, bursting into tears; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthe burden of it crushes me to the earth! It seems a crime to know\r\nof such a thing, and to keep it to myself. It knocks within my heart\r\ncontinually, threatening, imploring, insisting to be let out! O my\r\nmother!--my mother! Were she yet living, I would travel over land and\r\nsea to tell her this dark secret, as I told all the little troubles of\r\nmy infancy. But I am alone--alone! Miriam, you were my dearest, only\r\nfriend. Advise me what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a singular appeal, no doubt, from the stainless maiden to the\r\nguilty woman, whom she had just banished from her heart forever. But\r\nit bore striking testimony to the impression which Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s natural\r\nuprightness and impulsive generosity had made on the friend who knew her\r\nbest; and it deeply comforted the poor criminal, by proving to her that\r\nthe bond between Hilda and herself was vital yet.\r\n\r\nAs far as she was able, Miriam at once responded to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s cry for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I deemed it good for your peace of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto bear\r\ntestimony against me for this deed in the face of all the world, no\r\nconsideration of myself should weigh with me an instant. But I believe\r\nthat you would find no relief in such a course. What men call justice\r\nlies chiefly in outward formalities, and has never the close application\r\nand fitness that would be satisfactory to a soul like yours. I cannot be\r\nfairly tried and judged before an earthly tribunal; and of this, Hilda,\r\nyou would perhaps become fatally conscious when it was too late. Roman\r\njustice, above all things, is a byword. What have you to do with it?\r\nLeave all such thoughts aside! Yet, Hilda, I would not have you keep my\r\nsecret imprisoned in your heart if it tries to leap out, and stings you,\r\nlike a wild, venomous thing, when you thrust it back again. Have you no\r\nother friend, now that you have been forced to give me up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo other,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hilda sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Kenyon!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Miriam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot be my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause--because--I have fancied\r\nthat he sought to be something more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miriam, shaking her head, with a strange smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis story will frighten his new-born love out of its little life, if\r\nthat be what you wish. Tell him the secret, then, and take his wise and\r\nhonorable counsel as to what should next be done. I know not what else\r\nto say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never dreamed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hilda,--\xe2\x80\x9chow could you think it?--of betraying\r\nyou to justice. But I see how it is, Miriam. I must keep your secret,\r\nand die of it, unless God sends me some relief by methods which are now\r\nbeyond my power to imagine. It is very dreadful. Ah! now I understand\r\nhow the sins of generations past have created an atmosphere of sin\r\nfor those that follow. While there is a single guilty person in the\r\nuniverse, each innocent one must feel his innocence tortured by that\r\nguilt. Your deed, Miriam, has darkened the whole sky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Hilda turned from her unhappy friend, and, sinking on her knees in\r\na corner of the chamber, could not be prevailed upon to utter another\r\nword. And Miriam, with a long regard from the threshold, bade farewell\r\nto this doves\xe2\x80\x99 nest, this one little nook of pure thoughts and innocent\r\nenthusiasms, into which she had brought such trouble. Every crime\r\ndestroys more Edens than our own!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x99s The Marble Faun, Volume I., by Nathaniel Hawthorne\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MARBLE FAUN, VOLUME I. ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2181-0.txt or 2181-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/8/2181/\r\n\r\nProduced by Michael Pullen and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
