The girl\r\nrowed, pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man, with the\r\nrudder-lines slack in his hands, and his hands loose in his waistband,\r\nkept an eager look out. He had no net, hook, or line, and he could\r\nnot be a fisherman; his boat had no cushion for a sitter, no paint, no\r\ninscription, no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope,\r\nand he could not be a waterman; his boat was too crazy and too small\r\nto take in cargo for delivery, and he could not be a lighterman or\r\nriver-carrier; there was no clue to what he looked for, but he looked\r\nfor something, with a most intent and searching gaze. The tide, which\r\nhad turned an hour before, was running down, and his eyes watched\r\nevery little race and eddy in its broad sweep, as the boat made slight\r\nhead-way against it, or drove stern foremost before it, according as he\r\ndirected his daughter by a movement of his head. She watched his face\r\nas earnestly as he watched the river. But, in the intensity of her look\r\nthere was a touch of dread or horror.\r\n\r\nAllied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface, by reason of\r\nthe slime and ooze with which it was covered, and its sodden state, this\r\nboat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they\r\noften did, and were seeking what they often sought. Half savage as the\r\nman showed, with no covering on his matted head, with his brown arms\r\nbare to between the elbow and the shoulder, with the loose knot of a\r\nlooser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard\r\nand whisker, with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the\r\nmud that begrimed his boat, still there was a business-like usage in his\r\nsteady gaze. So with every lithe action of the girl, with every turn of\r\nher wrist, perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror; they\r\nwere things of usage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep her out, Lizzie. Tide runs strong here. Keep her well afore the\r\nsweep of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTrusting to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s skill and making no use of the rudder, he eyed\r\nthe coming tide with an absorbed attention. So the girl eyed him. But,\r\nit happened now, that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into\r\nthe bottom of the boat, and, touching a rotten stain there which bore\r\nsome resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form, coloured it as\r\nthough with diluted blood. This caught the girl\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and she shivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What ails you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, immediately aware of it, though so intent\r\non the advancing waters; \xe2\x80\x98I see nothing afloat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe red light was gone, the shudder was gone, and his gaze, which had\r\ncome back to the boat for a moment, travelled away again. Wheresoever\r\nthe strong tide met with an impediment, his gaze paused for an instant.\r\nAt every mooring-chain and rope, at every stationery boat or barge that\r\nsplit the current into a broad-arrowhead, at the offsets from the piers\r\nof Southwark Bridge, at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat\r\nthe filthy water, at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying\r\noff certain wharves, his shining eyes darted a hungry look. After a\r\ndarkening hour or so, suddenly the rudder-lines tightened in his hold,\r\nand he steered hard towards the Surrey shore.\r\n\r\nAlways watching his face, the girl instantly answered to the action in\r\nher sculling; presently the boat swung round, quivered as from a sudden\r\njerk, and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern.\r\n\r\nThe girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore, over her head and over her\r\nface, and, looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were\r\nturned down the river, kept the boat in that direction going before the\r\ntide. Until now, the boat had barely held her own, and had hovered about\r\none spot; but now, the banks changed swiftly, and the deepening shadows\r\nand the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed, and the tiers of\r\nshipping lay on either hand.\r\n\r\nIt was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the\r\nboat. His arms were wet and dirty, and he washed them over the side. In\r\nhis right hand he held something, and he washed that in the river too.\r\nIt was money. He chinked it once, and he blew upon it once, and he spat\r\nupon it once,--\xe2\x80\x98for luck,\xe2\x80\x99 he hoarsely said--before he put it in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl turned her face towards him with a start, and rowed in silence.\r\nHer face was very pale. He was a hook-nosed man, and with that and his\r\nbright eyes and his ruffled head, bore a certain likeness to a roused\r\nbird of prey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take that thing off your face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe put it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here! and give me hold of the sculls. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the rest of the spell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, father! No! I can\xe2\x80\x99t indeed. Father!--I cannot sit so near it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was moving towards her to change places, but her terrified\r\nexpostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What hurt can it do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None, none. But I cannot bear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief you hate the sight of the very river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I do not like it, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your living! As if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meat and drink to you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt these latter words the girl shivered again, and for a moment paused\r\nin her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It escaped his attention,\r\nfor he was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you be so thankless to your best friend, Lizzie? The very\r\nfire that warmed you when you were a babby, was picked out of the river\r\nalongside the coal barges. The very basket that you slept in, the tide\r\nwashed ashore. The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle\r\nof it, I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie took her right hand from the scull it held, and touched her\r\nlips with it, and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him: then,\r\nwithout speaking, she resumed her rowing, as another boat of similar\r\nappearance, though in rather better trim, came out from a dark place and\r\ndropped softly alongside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In luck again, Gaffer?\xe2\x80\x99 said a man with a squinting leer, who sculled\r\nher and who was alone, \xe2\x80\x98I know\xe2\x80\x99d you was in luck again, by your wake as\r\nyou come down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other, drily. \xe2\x80\x98So you\xe2\x80\x99re out, are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, pardner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was now a tender yellow moonlight on the river, and the new comer,\r\nkeeping half his boat\xe2\x80\x99s length astern of the other boat looked hard at\r\nits track.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I says to myself,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98directly you hove in view, yonder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGaffer, and in luck again, by George if he ain\xe2\x80\x99t! Scull it is,\r\npardner--don\xe2\x80\x99t fret yourself--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch him.\xe2\x80\x99 This was in answer\r\nto a quick impatient movement on the part of Gaffer: the speaker at the\r\nsame time unshipping his scull on that side, and laying his hand on the\r\ngunwale of Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s boat and holding to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s had touches enough not to want no more, as well as I make him\r\nout, Gaffer! Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\npardner? Such is my out-of-luck ways, you see! He must have passed me\r\nwhen he went up last time, for I was on the lookout below bridge here. I\r\na\xe2\x80\x99most think you\xe2\x80\x99re like the wulturs, pardner, and scent \xe2\x80\x98em out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a dropped voice, and with more than one glance at Lizzie who\r\nhad pulled on her hood again. Both men then looked with a weird unholy\r\ninterest in the wake of Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Easy does it, betwixt us. Shall I take him aboard, pardner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other. In so surly a tone that the man, after a blank\r\nstare, acknowledged it with the retort:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Arn\xe2\x80\x99t been eating nothing as has disagreed with you, have you,\r\npardner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yes, I have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gaffer. \xe2\x80\x98I have been swallowing too much of\r\nthat word, Pardner. I am no pardner of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since when was you no pardner of mine, Gaffer Hexam Esquire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since you was accused of robbing a man. Accused of robbing a live man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Gaffer, with great indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what if I had been accused of robbing a dead man, Gaffer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You COULDN\xe2\x80\x99T do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Gaffer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Has a dead man any use for money? Is it possible for a dead man to\r\nhave money? What world does a dead man belong to? \xe2\x80\x98Tother world. What\r\nworld does money belong to? This world. How can money be a corpse\xe2\x80\x99s? Can\r\na corpse own it, want it, spend it, claim it, miss it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to go\r\nconfounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way. But it\xe2\x80\x99s worthy\r\nof the sneaking spirit that robs a live man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is--.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No you won\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is. You got off with a short time\r\nof it for putting your hand in the pocket of a sailor, a live sailor.\r\nMake the most of it and think yourself lucky, but don\xe2\x80\x99t think after\r\nthat to come over ME with your pardners. We have worked together in time\r\npast, but we work together no more in time present nor yet future. Let\r\ngo. Cast off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gaffer! If you think to get rid of me this way--.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I don\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of you this way, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try another, and chop you over\r\nthe fingers with the stretcher, or take a pick at your head with the\r\nboat-hook. Cast off! Pull you, Lizzie. Pull home, since you won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nyour father pull.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie shot ahead, and the other boat fell astern. Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s father,\r\ncomposing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the\r\nhigh moralities and taken an unassailable position, slowly lighted a\r\npipe, and smoked, and took a survey of what he had in tow. What he had\r\nin tow, lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat\r\nwas checked, and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away, though\r\nfor the most part it followed submissively. A neophyte might have\r\nfancied that the ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint\r\nchanges of expression on a sightless face; but Gaffer was no neophyte\r\nand had no fancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nTHE MAN FROM SOMEWHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Veneering were bran-new people in a bran-new house in a\r\nbran-new quarter of London. Everything about the Veneerings was spick\r\nand span new. All their furniture was new, all their friends were new,\r\nall their servants were new, their plate was new, their carriage was\r\nnew, their harness was new, their horses were new, their pictures\r\nwere new, they themselves were new, they were as newly married as was\r\nlawfully compatible with their having a bran-new baby, and if they had\r\nset up a great-grandfather, he would have come home in matting from the\r\nPantechnicon, without a scratch upon him, French polished to the crown\r\nof his head.\r\n\r\nFor, in the Veneering establishment, from the hall-chairs with the new\r\ncoat of arms, to the grand pianoforte with the new action, and upstairs\r\nagain to the new fire-escape, all things were in a state of high varnish\r\nand polish. And what was observable in the furniture, was observable in\r\nthe Veneerings--the surface smelt a little too much of the workshop and\r\nwas a trifle sticky.\r\n\r\nThere was an innocent piece of dinner-furniture that went upon easy\r\ncastors and was kept over a livery stable-yard in Duke Street, Saint\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99s, when not in use, to whom the Veneerings were a source of blind\r\nconfusion. The name of this article was Twemlow. Being first cousin\r\nto Lord Snigsworth, he was in frequent requisition, and at many houses\r\nmight be said to represent the dining-table in its normal state. Mr and\r\nMrs Veneering, for example, arranging a dinner, habitually started with\r\nTwemlow, and then put leaves in him, or added guests to him. Sometimes,\r\nthe table consisted of Twemlow and half a dozen leaves; sometimes, of\r\nTwemlow and a dozen leaves; sometimes, Twemlow was pulled out to his\r\nutmost extent of twenty leaves. Mr and Mrs Veneering on occasions of\r\nceremony faced each other in the centre of the board, and thus the\r\nparallel still held; for, it always happened that the more Twemlow was\r\npulled out, the further he found himself from the center, and nearer\r\nto the sideboard at one end of the room, or the window-curtains at the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut, it was not this which steeped the feeble soul of Twemlow in\r\nconfusion. This he was used to, and could take soundings of. The abyss\r\nto which he could find no bottom, and from which started forth the\r\nengrossing and ever-swelling difficulty of his life, was the insoluble\r\nquestion whether he was Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friend, or newest friend.\r\nTo the excogitation of this problem, the harmless gentleman had devoted\r\nmany anxious hours, both in his lodgings over the livery stable-yard,\r\nand in the cold gloom, favourable to meditation, of Saint James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSquare. Thus. Twemlow had first known Veneering at his club, where\r\nVeneering then knew nobody but the man who made them known to one\r\nanother, who seemed to be the most intimate friend he had in the world,\r\nand whom he had known two days--the bond of union between their souls,\r\nthe nefarious conduct of the committee respecting the cookery of\r\na fillet of veal, having been accidentally cemented at that date.\r\nImmediately upon this, Twemlow received an invitation to dine with\r\nVeneering, and dined: the man being of the party. Immediately upon\r\nthat, Twemlow received an invitation to dine with the man, and dined:\r\nVeneering being of the party. At the man\xe2\x80\x99s were a Member, an Engineer, a\r\nPayer-off of the National Debt, a Poem on Shakespeare, a Grievance, and\r\na Public Office, who all seem to be utter strangers to Veneering. And\r\nyet immediately after that, Twemlow received an invitation to dine at\r\nVeneerings, expressly to meet the Member, the Engineer, the Payer-off\r\nof the National Debt, the Poem on Shakespeare, the Grievance, and the\r\nPublic Office, and, dining, discovered that all of them were the most\r\nintimate friends Veneering had in the world, and that the wives of all\r\nof them (who were all there) were the objects of Mrs Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\ndevoted affection and tender confidence.\r\n\r\nThus it had come about, that Mr Twemlow had said to himself in his\r\nlodgings, with his hand to his forehead: \xe2\x80\x98I must not think of this. This\r\nis enough to soften any man\xe2\x80\x99s brain,\xe2\x80\x99--and yet was always thinking of\r\nit, and could never form a conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis evening the Veneerings give a banquet. Eleven leaves in the\r\nTwemlow; fourteen in company all told. Four pigeon-breasted retainers in\r\nplain clothes stand in line in the hall. A fifth retainer, proceeding up\r\nthe staircase with a mournful air--as who should say, \xe2\x80\x98Here is another\r\nwretched creature come to dinner; such is life!\xe2\x80\x99--announces, \xe2\x80\x98Mis-ter\r\nTwemlow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Veneering welcomes her sweet Mr Twemlow. Mr Veneering welcomes\r\nhis dear Twemlow. Mrs Veneering does not expect that Mr Twemlow can in\r\nnature care much for such insipid things as babies, but so old a friend\r\nmust please to look at baby. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! You will know the friend of your\r\nfamily better, Tootleums,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Veneering, nodding emotionally at\r\nthat new article, \xe2\x80\x98when you begin to take notice.\xe2\x80\x99 He then begs to make\r\nhis dear Twemlow known to his two friends, Mr Boots and Mr Brewer--and\r\nclearly has no distinct idea which is which.\r\n\r\nBut now a fearful circumstance occurs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mis-ter and Mis-sus Podsnap!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Veneering to Mrs Veneering, with an air of much\r\nfriendly interest, while the door stands open, \xe2\x80\x98the Podsnaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA too, too smiling large man, with a fatal freshness on him, appearing\r\nwith his wife, instantly deserts his wife and darts at Twemlow with:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you do? So glad to know you. Charming house you have here. I\r\nhope we are not late. So glad of the opportunity, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the first shock fell upon him, Twemlow twice skipped back in\r\nhis neat little shoes and his neat little silk stockings of a bygone\r\nfashion, as if impelled to leap over a sofa behind him; but the large\r\nman closed with him and proved too strong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me,\xe2\x80\x99 says the large man, trying to attract the attention of his\r\nwife in the distance, \xe2\x80\x98have the pleasure of presenting Mrs Podsnap\r\nto her host. She will be,\xe2\x80\x99 in his fatal freshness he seems to find\r\nperpetual verdure and eternal youth in the phrase, \xe2\x80\x98she will be so glad\r\nof the opportunity, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mrs Podsnap, unable to originate a mistake on her own\r\naccount, because Mrs Veneering is the only other lady there, does her\r\nbest in the way of handsomely supporting her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, by looking\r\ntowards Mr Twemlow with a plaintive countenance and remarking to Mrs\r\nVeneering in a feeling manner, firstly, that she fears he has been\r\nrather bilious of late, and, secondly, that the baby is already very\r\nlike him.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether any man quite relishes being mistaken for\r\nany other man; but, Mr Veneering having this very evening set up the\r\nshirt-front of the young Antinous in new worked cambric just come home,\r\nis not at all complimented by being supposed to be Twemlow, who is dry\r\nand weazen and some thirty years older. Mrs Veneering equally resents\r\nthe imputation of being the wife of Twemlow. As to Twemlow, he is\r\nso sensible of being a much better bred man than Veneering, that he\r\nconsiders the large man an offensive ass.\r\n\r\nIn this complicated dilemma, Mr Veneering approaches the large man with\r\nextended hand and, smilingly assures that incorrigible personage that he\r\nis delighted to see him: who in his fatal freshness instantly replies:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. I am ashamed to say that I cannot at this moment recall\r\nwhere we met, but I am so glad of this opportunity, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen pouncing upon Twemlow, who holds back with all his feeble might, he\r\nis haling him off to present him, as Veneering, to Mrs Podsnap, when the\r\narrival of more guests unravels the mistake. Whereupon, having re-shaken\r\nhands with Veneering as Veneering, he re-shakes hands with Twemlow as\r\nTwemlow, and winds it all up to his own perfect satisfaction by saying\r\nto the last-named, \xe2\x80\x98Ridiculous opportunity--but so glad of it, I am\r\nsure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, Twemlow having undergone this terrific experience, having likewise\r\nnoted the fusion of Boots in Brewer and Brewer in Boots, and having\r\nfurther observed that of the remaining seven guests four discrete\r\ncharacters enter with wandering eyes and wholly declined to commit\r\nthemselves as to which is Veneering, until Veneering has them in his\r\ngrasp;--Twemlow having profited by these studies, finds his brain\r\nwholesomely hardening as he approaches the conclusion that he really is\r\nVeneering\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friend, when his brain softens again and all is\r\nlost, through his eyes encountering Veneering and the large man linked\r\ntogether as twin brothers in the back drawing-room near the conservatory\r\ndoor, and through his ears informing him in the tones of Mrs Veneering\r\nthat the same large man is to be baby\xe2\x80\x99s godfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dinner is on the table!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus the melancholy retainer, as who should say, \xe2\x80\x98Come down and be\r\npoisoned, ye unhappy children of men!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow, having no lady assigned him, goes down in the rear, with\r\nhis hand to his forehead. Boots and Brewer, thinking him indisposed,\r\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x98Man faint. Had no lunch.\xe2\x80\x99 But he is only stunned by the\r\nunvanquishable difficulty of his existence.\r\n\r\nRevived by soup, Twemlow discourses mildly of the Court Circular with\r\nBoots and Brewer. Is appealed to, at the fish stage of the banquet, by\r\nVeneering, on the disputed question whether his cousin Lord Snigsworth\r\nis in or out of town? Gives it that his cousin is out of town. \xe2\x80\x98At\r\nSnigsworthy Park?\xe2\x80\x99 Veneering inquires. \xe2\x80\x98At Snigsworthy,\xe2\x80\x99 Twemlow\r\nrejoins. Boots and Brewer regard this as a man to be cultivated; and\r\nVeneering is clear that he is a remunerative article. Meantime the\r\nretainer goes round, like a gloomy Analytical Chemist: always seeming\r\nto say, after \xe2\x80\x98Chablis, sir?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if you knew what it\xe2\x80\x99s made\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe great looking-glass above the sideboard, reflects the table and the\r\ncompany. Reflects the new Veneering crest, in gold and eke in silver,\r\nfrosted and also thawed, a camel of all work. The Heralds\xe2\x80\x99 College found\r\nout a Crusading ancestor for Veneering who bore a camel on his shield\r\n(or might have done it if he had thought of it), and a caravan of camels\r\ntake charge of the fruits and flowers and candles, and kneel down be\r\nloaded with the salt. Reflects Veneering; forty, wavy-haired, dark,\r\ntending to corpulence, sly, mysterious, filmy--a kind of sufficiently\r\nwell-looking veiled-prophet, not prophesying. Reflects Mrs Veneering;\r\nfair, aquiline-nosed and fingered, not so much light hair as she might\r\nhave, gorgeous in raiment and jewels, enthusiastic, propitiatory,\r\nconscious that a corner of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s veil is over herself. Reflects\r\nPodsnap; prosperously feeding, two little light-coloured wiry wings, one\r\non either side of his else bald head, looking as like his hairbrushes as\r\nhis hair, dissolving view of red beads on his forehead, large allowance\r\nof crumpled shirt-collar up behind. Reflects Mrs Podsnap; fine woman\r\nfor Professor Owen, quantity of bone, neck and nostrils like a\r\nrocking-horse, hard features, majestic head-dress in which Podsnap has\r\nhung golden offerings. Reflects Twemlow; grey, dry, polite, susceptible\r\nto east wind, First-Gentleman-in-Europe collar and cravat, cheeks drawn\r\nin as if he had made a great effort to retire into himself some years\r\nago, and had got so far and had never got any farther. Reflects mature\r\nyoung lady; raven locks, and complexion that lights up well when well\r\npowdered--as it is--carrying on considerably in the captivation of\r\nmature young gentleman; with too much nose in his face, too much ginger\r\nin his whiskers, too much torso in his waistcoat, too much sparkle in\r\nhis studs, his eyes, his buttons, his talk, and his teeth. Reflects\r\ncharming old Lady Tippins on Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s right; with an immense obtuse\r\ndrab oblong face, like a face in a tablespoon, and a dyed Long Walk up\r\nthe top of her head, as a convenient public approach to the bunch of\r\nfalse hair behind, pleased to patronize Mrs Veneering opposite, who\r\nis pleased to be patronized. Reflects a certain \xe2\x80\x98Mortimer\xe2\x80\x99, another\r\nof Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends; who never was in the house before,\r\nand appears not to want to come again, who sits disconsolate on Mrs\r\nVeneering\xe2\x80\x99s left, and who was inveigled by Lady Tippins (a friend of\r\nhis boyhood) to come to these people\xe2\x80\x99s and talk, and who won\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\r\nReflects Eugene, friend of Mortimer; buried alive in the back of his\r\nchair, behind a shoulder--with a powder-epaulette on it--of the mature\r\nyoung lady, and gloomily resorting to the champagne chalice whenever\r\nproffered by the Analytical Chemist. Lastly, the looking-glass reflects\r\nBoots and Brewer, and two other stuffed Buffers interposed between the\r\nrest of the company and possible accidents.\r\n\r\nThe Veneering dinners are excellent dinners--or new people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome--and all goes well. Notably, Lady Tippins has made a series of\r\nexperiments on her digestive functions, so extremely complicated and\r\ndaring, that if they could be published with their results it might\r\nbenefit the human race. Having taken in provisions from all parts of the\r\nworld, this hardy old cruiser has last touched at the North Pole, when,\r\nas the ice-plates are being removed, the following words fall from her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, my dear Veneering--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Poor Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s hand approaches his forehead, for it would seem now,\r\nthat Lady Tippins is going to be the oldest friend.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, my dear Veneering, that it is the oddest affair! Like\r\nthe advertising people, I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to trust me, without offering\r\na respectable reference. Mortimer there, is my reference, and knows all\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer raises his drooping eyelids, and slightly opens his mouth. But\r\na faint smile, expressive of \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the use!\xe2\x80\x99 passes over his face, and\r\nhe drops his eyelids and shuts his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lady Tippins, rapping the sticks of her closed\r\ngreen fan upon the knuckles of her left hand--which is particularly rich\r\nin knuckles, \xe2\x80\x98I insist upon your telling all that is to be told about\r\nthe man from Jamaica.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give you my honour I never heard of any man from Jamaica, except the\r\nman who was a brother,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tobago, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor yet from Tobago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene strikes in: so unexpectedly that the mature young lady,\r\nwho has forgotten all about him, with a start takes the epaulette out\r\nof his way: \xe2\x80\x98except our friend who long lived on rice-pudding and\r\nisinglass, till at length to his something or other, his physician said\r\nsomething else, and a leg of mutton somehow ended in daygo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA reviving impression goes round the table that Eugene is coming out. An\r\nunfulfilled impression, for he goes in again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my dear Mrs Veneering,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Lady Tippins, I appeal to you\r\nwhether this is not the basest conduct ever known in this world? I carry\r\nmy lovers about, two or three at a time, on condition that they are very\r\nobedient and devoted; and here is my oldest lover-in-chief, the head of\r\nall my slaves, throwing off his allegiance before company! And here is\r\nanother of my lovers, a rough Cymon at present certainly, but of whom\r\nI had most hopeful expectations as to his turning out well in course of\r\ntime, pretending that he can\xe2\x80\x99t remember his nursery rhymes! On purpose\r\nto annoy me, for he knows how I doat upon them!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA grisly little fiction concerning her lovers is Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s point.\r\nShe is always attended by a lover or two, and she keeps a little list\r\nof her lovers, and she is always booking a new lover, or striking out an\r\nold lover, or putting a lover in her black list, or promoting a lover to\r\nher blue list, or adding up her lovers, or otherwise posting her book.\r\nMrs Veneering is charmed by the humour, and so is Veneering. Perhaps it\r\nis enhanced by a certain yellow play in Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s throat, like the\r\nlegs of scratching poultry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I banish the false wretch from this moment, and I strike him out of\r\nmy Cupidon (my name for my Ledger, my dear,) this very night. But I am\r\nresolved to have the account of the man from Somewhere, and I beg you\r\nto elicit it for me, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 to Mrs Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98as I have lost my own\r\ninfluence. Oh, you perjured man!\xe2\x80\x99 This to Mortimer, with a rattle of her\r\nfan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are all very much interested in the man from Somewhere,\xe2\x80\x99 Veneering\r\nobserves.\r\n\r\nThen the four Buffers, taking heart of grace all four at once, say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Deeply interested!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite excited!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dramatic!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Man from Nowhere, perhaps!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd then Mrs Veneering--for the Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s winning wiles are\r\ncontagious--folds her hands in the manner of a supplicating child, turns\r\nto her left neighbour, and says, \xe2\x80\x98Tease! Pay! Man from Tumwhere!\xe2\x80\x99 At\r\nwhich the four Buffers, again mysteriously moved all four at once,\r\nexplain, \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t resist!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my life,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mortimer languidly, \xe2\x80\x98I find it immensely\r\nembarrassing to have the eyes of Europe upon me to this extent, and my\r\nonly consolation is that you will all of you execrate Lady Tippins in\r\nyour secret hearts when you find, as you inevitably will, the man from\r\nSomewhere a bore. Sorry to destroy romance by fixing him with a local\r\nhabitation, but he comes from the place, the name of which escapes me,\r\nbut will suggest itself to everybody else here, where they make the\r\nwine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene suggests \xe2\x80\x98Day and Martin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not that place,\xe2\x80\x99 returns the unmoved Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s where they\r\nmake the Port. My man comes from the country where they make the Cape\r\nWine. But look here, old fellow; its not at all statistical and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrather odd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is always noticeable at the table of the Veneerings, that no man\r\ntroubles himself much about the Veneerings themselves, and that any\r\none who has anything to tell, generally tells it to anybody else in\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man,\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer goes on, addressing Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98whose name is Harmon,\r\nwas only son of a tremendous old rascal who made his money by Dust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Red velveteens and a bell?\xe2\x80\x99 the gloomy Eugene inquires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a ladder and basket if you like. By which means, or by others, he\r\ngrew rich as a Dust Contractor, and lived in a hollow in a hilly country\r\nentirely composed of Dust. On his own small estate the growling old\r\nvagabond threw up his own mountain range, like an old volcano, and its\r\ngeological formation was Dust. Coal-dust, vegetable-dust, bone-dust,\r\ncrockery dust, rough dust and sifted dust,--all manner of Dust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA passing remembrance of Mrs Veneering, here induces Mortimer to address\r\nhis next half-dozen words to her; after which he wanders away again,\r\ntries Twemlow and finds he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer, ultimately takes up with the\r\nBuffers who receive him enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The moral being--I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the right expression--of this\r\nexemplary person, derived its highest gratification from anathematizing\r\nhis nearest relations and turning them out of doors. Having begun (as\r\nwas natural) by rendering these attentions to the wife of his bosom,\r\nhe next found himself at leisure to bestow a similar recognition on the\r\nclaims of his daughter. He chose a husband for her, entirely to his own\r\nsatisfaction and not in the least to hers, and proceeded to settle upon\r\nher, as her marriage portion, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much Dust, but something\r\nimmense. At this stage of the affair the poor girl respectfully\r\nintimated that she was secretly engaged to that popular character whom\r\nthe novelists and versifiers call Another, and that such a marriage\r\nwould make Dust of her heart and Dust of her life--in short, would\r\nset her up, on a very extensive scale, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s business.\r\nImmediately, the venerable parent--on a cold winter\xe2\x80\x99s night, it is\r\nsaid--anathematized and turned her out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, the Analytical Chemist (who has evidently formed a very low\r\nopinion of Mortimer\xe2\x80\x99s story) concedes a little claret to the Buffers;\r\nwho, again mysteriously moved all four at once, screw it slowly into\r\nthemselves with a peculiar twist of enjoyment, as they cry in chorus,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The pecuniary resources of Another were, as they usually are, of a very\r\nlimited nature. I believe I am not using too strong an expression when\r\nI say that Another was hard up. However, he married the young lady, and\r\nthey lived in a humble dwelling, probably possessing a porch ornamented\r\nwith honeysuckle and woodbine twining, until she died. I must refer\r\nyou to the Registrar of the District in which the humble dwelling was\r\nsituated, for the certified cause of death; but early sorrow and anxiety\r\nmay have had to do with it, though they may not appear in the ruled\r\npages and printed forms. Indisputably this was the case with Another,\r\nfor he was so cut up by the loss of his young wife that if he outlived\r\nher a year it was as much as he did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere is that in the indolent Mortimer, which seems to hint that if good\r\nsociety might on any account allow itself to be impressible, he, one of\r\ngood society, might have the weakness to be impressed by what he here\r\nrelates. It is hidden with great pains, but it is in him. The gloomy\r\nEugene too, is not without some kindred touch; for, when that appalling\r\nLady Tippins declares that if Another had survived, he should have gone\r\ndown at the head of her list of lovers--and also when the mature young\r\nlady shrugs her epaulettes, and laughs at some private and confidential\r\ncomment from the mature young gentleman--his gloom deepens to that\r\ndegree that he trifles quite ferociously with his dessert-knife.\r\n\r\nMortimer proceeds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must now return, as novelists say, and as we all wish they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nto the man from Somewhere. Being a boy of fourteen, cheaply educated\r\nat Brussels when his sister\xe2\x80\x99s expulsion befell, it was some little time\r\nbefore he heard of it--probably from herself, for the mother was dead;\r\nbut that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Instantly, he absconded, and came over here. He\r\nmust have been a boy of spirit and resource, to get here on a stopped\r\nallowance of five sous a week; but he did it somehow, and he burst in\r\non his father, and pleaded his sister\xe2\x80\x99s cause. Venerable parent promptly\r\nresorts to anathematization, and turns him out. Shocked and terrified\r\nboy takes flight, seeks his fortune, gets aboard ship, ultimately\r\nturns up on dry land among the Cape wine: small proprietor, farmer,\r\ngrower--whatever you like to call it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, shuffling is heard in the hall, and tapping is heard\r\nat the dining-room door. Analytical Chemist goes to the door, confers\r\nangrily with unseen tapper, appears to become mollified by descrying\r\nreason in the tapping, and goes out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he was discovered, only the other day, after having been expatriated\r\nabout fourteen years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA Buffer, suddenly astounding the other three, by detaching himself, and\r\nasserting individuality, inquires: \xe2\x80\x98How discovered, and why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! To be sure. Thank you for reminding me. Venerable parent dies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSame Buffer, emboldened by success, says: \xe2\x80\x98When?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The other day. Ten or twelve months ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSame Buffer inquires with smartness, \xe2\x80\x98What of?\xe2\x80\x99 But herein perishes a\r\nmelancholy example; being regarded by the three other Buffers with a\r\nstony stare, and attracting no further attention from any mortal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Venerable parent,\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer repeats with a passing remembrance that\r\nthere is a Veneering at table, and for the first time addressing\r\nhim--\xe2\x80\x98dies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe gratified Veneering repeats, gravely, \xe2\x80\x98dies\xe2\x80\x99; and folds his arms,\r\nand composes his brow to hear it out in a judicial manner, when he finds\r\nhimself again deserted in the bleak world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His will is found,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, catching Mrs Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrocking-horse\xe2\x80\x99s eye. \xe2\x80\x98It is dated very soon after the son\xe2\x80\x99s flight. It\r\nleaves the lowest of the range of dust-mountains, with some sort of a\r\ndwelling-house at its foot, to an old servant who is sole executor, and\r\nall the rest of the property--which is very considerable--to the son.\r\nHe directs himself to be buried with certain eccentric ceremonies and\r\nprecautions against his coming to life, with which I need not bore you,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s all--except--\xe2\x80\x99 and this ends the story.\r\n\r\nThe Analytical Chemist returning, everybody looks at him. Not because\r\nanybody wants to see him, but because of that subtle influence in nature\r\nwhich impels humanity to embrace the slightest opportunity of looking at\r\nanything, rather than the person who addresses it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Except that the son\xe2\x80\x99s inheriting is made conditional on his marrying\r\na girl, who at the date of the will, was a child of four or five years\r\nold, and who is now a marriageable young woman. Advertisement and\r\ninquiry discovered the son in the man from Somewhere, and at the present\r\nmoment, he is on his way home from there--no doubt, in a state of great\r\nastonishment--to succeed to a very large fortune, and to take a wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Podsnap inquires whether the young person is a young person of\r\npersonal charms? Mortimer is unable to report.\r\n\r\nMr Podsnap inquires what would become of the very large fortune, in the\r\nevent of the marriage condition not being fulfilled? Mortimer replies,\r\nthat by special testamentary clause it would then go to the old servant\r\nabove mentioned, passing over and excluding the son; also, that if\r\nthe son had not been living, the same old servant would have been sole\r\nresiduary legatee.\r\n\r\nMrs Veneering has just succeeded in waking Lady Tippins from a snore, by\r\ndexterously shunting a train of plates and dishes at her knuckles across\r\nthe table; when everybody but Mortimer himself becomes aware that the\r\nAnalytical Chemist is, in a ghostly manner, offering him a folded paper.\r\nCuriosity detains Mrs Veneering a few moments.\r\n\r\nMortimer, in spite of all the arts of the chemist, placidly refreshes\r\nhimself with a glass of Madeira, and remains unconscious of the Document\r\nwhich engrosses the general attention, until Lady Tippins (who has a\r\nhabit of waking totally insensible), having remembered where she is, and\r\nrecovered a perception of surrounding objects, says: \xe2\x80\x98Falser man than\r\nDon Juan; why don\xe2\x80\x99t you take the note from the commendatore?\xe2\x80\x99 Upon\r\nwhich, the chemist advances it under the nose of Mortimer, who looks\r\nround at him, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnalytical Chemist bends and whispers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98WHO?\xe2\x80\x99 Says Mortimer.\r\n\r\nAnalytical Chemist again bends and whispers.\r\n\r\nMortimer stares at him, and unfolds the paper. Reads it, reads it twice,\r\nturns it over to look at the blank outside, reads it a third time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This arrives in an extraordinarily opportune manner,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mortimer\r\nthen, looking with an altered face round the table: \xe2\x80\x98this is the\r\nconclusion of the story of the identical man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Already married?\xe2\x80\x99 one guesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Declines to marry?\xe2\x80\x99 another guesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Codicil among the dust?\xe2\x80\x99 another guesses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, no,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mortimer; \xe2\x80\x98remarkable thing, you are all wrong. The\r\nstory is completer and rather more exciting than I supposed. Man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrowned!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nANOTHER MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the disappearing skirts of the ladies ascended the Veneering\r\nstaircase, Mortimer, following them forth from the dining-room, turned\r\ninto a library of bran-new books, in bran-new bindings liberally gilded,\r\nand requested to see the messenger who had brought the paper. He was a\r\nboy of about fifteen. Mortimer looked at the boy, and the boy looked\r\nat the bran-new pilgrims on the wall, going to Canterbury in more gold\r\nframe than procession, and more carving than country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose writing is this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mine, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who told you to write it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My father, Jesse Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it he who found the body?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy hesitated, looked reproachfully at the pilgrims as if they had\r\ninvolved him in a little difficulty, then said, folding a plait in the\r\nright leg of his trousers, \xe2\x80\x98He gets his living along-shore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it far?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is which far?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the boy, upon his guard, and again upon the road\r\nto Canterbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To your father\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a goodish stretch, sir. I come up in a cab, and the cab\xe2\x80\x99s waiting\r\nto be paid. We could go back in it before you paid it, if you liked.\r\nI went first to your office, according to the direction of the papers\r\nfound in the pockets, and there I see nobody but a chap of about my age\r\nwho sent me on here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a curious mixture in the boy, of uncompleted savagery, and\r\nuncompleted civilization. His voice was hoarse and coarse, and his face\r\nwas coarse, and his stunted figure was coarse; but he was cleaner than\r\nother boys of his type; and his writing, though large and round,\r\nwas good; and he glanced at the backs of the books, with an awakened\r\ncuriosity that went below the binding. No one who can read, ever looks\r\nat a book, even unopened on a shelf, like one who cannot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were any means taken, do you know, boy, to ascertain if it was possible\r\nto restore life?\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer inquired, as he sought for his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask, sir, if you knew his state. Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s multitude that\r\nwere drowned in the Red Sea, ain\xe2\x80\x99t more beyond restoring to life. If\r\nLazarus was only half as far gone, that was the greatest of all the\r\nmiracles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mortimer, turning round with his hat upon his head, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nseem to be at home in the Red Sea, my young friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Read of it with teacher at the school,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Lazarus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and him too. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell my father! We should have no peace\r\nin our place, if that got touched upon. It\xe2\x80\x99s my sister\xe2\x80\x99s contriving.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem to have a good sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She ain\xe2\x80\x99t half bad,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy; \xe2\x80\x98but if she knows her letters it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe most she does--and them I learned her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe gloomy Eugene, with his hands in his pockets, had strolled in and\r\nassisted at the latter part of the dialogue; when the boy spoke these\r\nwords slightingly of his sister, he took him roughly enough by the chin,\r\nand turned up his face to look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, resisting; \xe2\x80\x98I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll know me\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene vouchsafed no answer; but made the proposal to Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo with you, if you like?\xe2\x80\x99 So, they all three went away together in the\r\nvehicle that had brought the boy; the two friends (once boys together at\r\na public school) inside, smoking cigars; the messenger on the box beside\r\nthe driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, as they went along; \xe2\x80\x98I have been, Eugene,\r\nupon the honourable roll of solicitors of the High Court of Chancery,\r\nand attorneys at Common Law, five years; and--except gratuitously taking\r\ninstructions, on an average once a fortnight, for the will of Lady\r\nTippins who has nothing to leave--I have had no scrap of business but\r\nthis romantic business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98have been \xe2\x80\x9ccalled\xe2\x80\x9d seven years, and have had no\r\nbusiness at all, and never shall have any. And if I had, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am far from being clear as to the last particular,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nMortimer, with great composure, \xe2\x80\x98that I have much advantage over you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, putting his legs up on the opposite seat, \xe2\x80\x98I hate\r\nmy profession.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I incommode you, if I put mine up too?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mortimer. \xe2\x80\x98Thank\r\nyou. I hate mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was forced upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gloomy Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98because it was\r\nunderstood that we wanted a barrister in the family. We have got a\r\nprecious one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was forced upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98because it was understood that\r\nwe wanted a solicitor in the family. And we have got a precious one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are four of us, with our names painted on a door-post in right of\r\none black hole called a set of chambers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98and each of us\r\nhas the fourth of a clerk--Cassim Baba, in the robber\xe2\x80\x99s cave--and Cassim\r\nis the only respectable member of the party.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am one by myself, one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98high up an awful staircase\r\ncommanding a burial-ground, and I have a whole clerk to myself, and he\r\nhas nothing to do but look at the burial-ground, and what he will turn\r\nout when arrived at maturity, I cannot conceive. Whether, in that shabby\r\nrook\xe2\x80\x99s nest, he is always plotting wisdom, or plotting murder; whether\r\nhe will grow up, after so much solitary brooding, to enlighten his\r\nfellow-creatures, or to poison them; is the only speck of interest that\r\npresents itself to my professional view. Will you give me a light? Thank\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then idiots talk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, leaning back, folding his arms, smoking\r\nwith his eyes shut, and speaking slightly through his nose, \xe2\x80\x98of Energy.\r\nIf there is a word in the dictionary under any letter from A to Z that\r\nI abominate, it is energy. It is such a conventional superstition, such\r\nparrot gabble! What the deuce! Am I to rush out into the street, collar\r\nthe first man of a wealthy appearance that I meet, shake him, and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to law upon the spot, you dog, and retain me, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the death\r\nof you\xe2\x80\x9d? Yet that would be energy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely my view of the case, Eugene. But show me a good opportunity,\r\nshow me something really worth being energetic about, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you\r\nenergy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so will I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\nAnd it is likely enough that ten thousand other young men, within the\r\nlimits of the London Post-office town delivery, made the same hopeful\r\nremark in the course of the same evening.\r\n\r\nThe wheels rolled on, and rolled down by the Monument and by the Tower,\r\nand by the Docks; down by Ratcliffe, and by Rotherhithe; down by where\r\naccumulated scum of humanity seemed to be washed from higher grounds,\r\nlike so much moral sewage, and to be pausing until its own weight forced\r\nit over the bank and sunk it in the river. In and out among vessels\r\nthat seemed to have got ashore, and houses that seemed to have got\r\nafloat--among bow-splits staring into windows, and windows staring\r\ninto ships--the wheels rolled on, until they stopped at a dark corner,\r\nriver-washed and otherwise not washed at all, where the boy alighted and\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must walk the rest, sir; it\xe2\x80\x99s not many yards.\xe2\x80\x99 He spoke in the\r\nsingular number, to the express exclusion of Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a confoundedly out-of-the-way place,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, slipping\r\nover the stones and refuse on the shore, as the boy turned the corner\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s my father\xe2\x80\x99s, sir; where the light is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe low building had the look of having once been a mill. There was a\r\nrotten wart of wood upon its forehead that seemed to indicate where\r\nthe sails had been, but the whole was very indistinctly seen in the\r\nobscurity of the night. The boy lifted the latch of the door, and they\r\npassed at once into a low circular room, where a man stood before a red\r\nfire, looking down into it, and a girl sat engaged in needlework. The\r\nfire was in a rusty brazier, not fitted to the hearth; and a common\r\nlamp, shaped like a hyacinth-root, smoked and flared in the neck of a\r\nstone bottle on the table. There was a wooden bunk or berth in a corner,\r\nand in another corner a wooden stair leading above--so clumsy and steep\r\nthat it was little better than a ladder. Two or three old sculls and\r\noars stood against the wall, and against another part of the wall was a\r\nsmall dresser, making a spare show of the commonest articles of crockery\r\nand cooking-vessels. The roof of the room was not plastered, but was\r\nformed of the flooring of the room above. This, being very old, knotted,\r\nseamed, and beamed, gave a lowering aspect to the chamber; and roof, and\r\nwalls, and floor, alike abounding in old smears of flour, red-lead (or\r\nsome such stain which it had probably acquired in warehousing), and\r\ndamp, alike had a look of decomposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentleman, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe figure at the red fire turned, raised its ruffled head, and looked\r\nlike a bird of prey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re Mortimer Lightwood Esquire; are you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mortimer Lightwood is my name. What you found,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, glancing\r\nrather shrinkingly towards the bunk; \xe2\x80\x98is it here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t not to say here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s close by. I do everything reg\xe2\x80\x99lar.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve giv\xe2\x80\x99 notice of the circumstarnce to the police, and the police have\r\ntook possession of it. No time ain\xe2\x80\x99t been lost, on any hand. The police\r\nhave put into print already, and here\xe2\x80\x99s what the print says of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTaking up the bottle with the lamp in it, he held it near a paper on\r\nthe wall, with the police heading, BODY FOUND. The two friends read the\r\nhandbill as it stuck against the wall, and Gaffer read them as he held\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only papers on the unfortunate man, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, glancing\r\nfrom the description of what was found, to the finder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only papers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the girl arose with her work in her hand, and went out at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No money,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mortimer; \xe2\x80\x98but threepence in one of the\r\nskirt-pockets.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three. Penny. Pieces,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gaffer Hexam, in as many sentences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The trousers pockets empty, and turned inside out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGaffer Hexam nodded. \xe2\x80\x98But that\xe2\x80\x99s common. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the wash of the\r\ntide or no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. Now, here,\xe2\x80\x99 moving the light to another similar\r\nplacard, \xe2\x80\x98HIS pockets was found empty, and turned inside out. And here,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmoving the light to another, \xe2\x80\x98HER pocket was found empty, and turned\r\ninside out. And so was this one\xe2\x80\x99s. And so was that one\xe2\x80\x99s. I can\xe2\x80\x99t read,\r\nnor I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to it, for I know \xe2\x80\x98em by their places on the wall. This\r\none was a sailor, with two anchors and a flag and G. F. T. on his arm.\r\nLook and see if he warn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This one was the young woman in grey boots, and her linen marked with a\r\ncross. Look and see if she warn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is him as had a nasty cut over the eye. This is them two young\r\nsisters what tied themselves together with a handkecher. This the\r\ndrunken old chap, in a pair of list slippers and a nightcap, wot had\r\noffered--it afterwards come out--to make a hole in the water for a\r\nquartern of rum stood aforehand, and kept to his word for the first and\r\nlast time in his life. They pretty well papers the room, you see; but I\r\nknow \xe2\x80\x98em all. I\xe2\x80\x99m scholar enough!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe waved the light over the whole, as if to typify the light of his\r\nscholarly intelligence, and then put it down on the table and stood\r\nbehind it looking intently at his visitors. He had the special\r\npeculiarity of some birds of prey, that when he knitted his brow, his\r\nruffled crest stood highest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did not find all these yourself; did you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Eugene.\r\n\r\nTo which the bird of prey slowly rejoined, \xe2\x80\x98And what might YOUR name be,\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer Lightwood interposed; \xe2\x80\x98Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Eugene Wrayburn, is it? And what might Mr Eugene Wrayburn have asked\r\nof me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I asked you, simply, if you found all these yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I answer you, simply, most on \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you suppose there has been much violence and robbery, beforehand,\r\namong these cases?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose at all about it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Gaffer. \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t one of the\r\nsupposing sort. If you\xe2\x80\x99d got your living to haul out of the river every\r\nday of your life, you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be much given to supposing. Am I to show\r\nthe way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he opened the door, in pursuance of a nod from Lightwood, an\r\nextremely pale and disturbed face appeared in the doorway--the face of a\r\nman much agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A body missing?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Gaffer Hexam, stopping short; \xe2\x80\x98or a body found?\r\nWhich?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am lost!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man, in a hurried and an eager manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lost?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I--am a stranger, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know the way. I--I--want to find the\r\nplace where I can see what is described here. It is possible I may know\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 He was panting, and could hardly speak; but, he showed a copy of\r\nthe newly-printed bill that was still wet upon the wall. Perhaps its\r\nnewness, or perhaps the accuracy of his observation of its general look,\r\nguided Gaffer to a ready conclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This gentleman, Mr Lightwood, is on that business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDuring a pause, Mortimer and the stranger confronted each other. Neither\r\nknew the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, breaking the awkward silence with his\r\nairy self-possession, \xe2\x80\x98that you did me the honour to mention my name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I repeated it, after this man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said you were a stranger in London?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An utter stranger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you seeking a Mr Harmon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I believe I can assure you that you are on a fruitless errand, and\r\nwill not find what you fear to find. Will you come with us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little winding through some muddy alleys that might have been\r\ndeposited by the last ill-savoured tide, brought them to the\r\nwicket-gate and bright lamp of a Police Station; where they found the\r\nNight-Inspector, with a pen and ink, and ruler, posting up his books in\r\na whitewashed office, as studiously as if he were in a monastery on\r\ntop of a mountain, and no howling fury of a drunken woman were banging\r\nherself against a cell-door in the back-yard at his elbow. With the\r\nsame air of a recluse much given to study, he desisted from his books to\r\nbestow a distrustful nod of recognition upon Gaffer, plainly importing,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! we know all about YOU, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll overdo it some day;\xe2\x80\x99 and to\r\ninform Mr Mortimer Lightwood and friends, that he would attend them\r\nimmediately. Then, he finished ruling the work he had in hand (it might\r\nhave been illuminating a missal, he was so calm), in a very neat and\r\nmethodical manner, showing not the slightest consciousness of the woman\r\nwho was banging herself with increased violence, and shrieking most\r\nterrifically for some other woman\xe2\x80\x99s liver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Night-Inspector, taking up his keys. Which a\r\ndeferential satellite produced. \xe2\x80\x98Now, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith one of his keys, he opened a cool grot at the end of the yard,\r\nand they all went in. They quickly came out again, no one speaking but\r\nEugene: who remarked to Mortimer, in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x98Not MUCH worse than\r\nLady Tippins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, back to the whitewashed library of the monastery--with that liver\r\nstill in shrieking requisition, as it had been loudly, while they looked\r\nat the silent sight they came to see--and there through the merits of\r\nthe case as summed up by the Abbot. No clue to how body came into river.\r\nVery often was no clue. Too late to know for certain, whether injuries\r\nreceived before or after death; one excellent surgical opinion said,\r\nbefore; other excellent surgical opinion said, after. Steward of ship in\r\nwhich gentleman came home passenger, had been round to view, and could\r\nswear to identity. Likewise could swear to clothes. And then, you\r\nsee, you had the papers, too. How was it he had totally disappeared on\r\nleaving ship, \xe2\x80\x98till found in river? Well! Probably had been upon some\r\nlittle game. Probably thought it a harmless game, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to things,\r\nand it turned out a fatal game. Inquest to-morrow, and no doubt open\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It appears to have knocked your friend over--knocked him completely off\r\nhis legs,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Inspector remarked, when he had finished his summing up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has given him a bad turn to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99 This was said in a very low\r\nvoice, and with a searching look (not the first he had cast) at the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood explained that it was no friend of his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, with an attentive ear; \xe2\x80\x98where did you pick\r\nhim up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood explained further.\r\n\r\nMr Inspector had delivered his summing up, and had added these words,\r\nwith his elbows leaning on his desk, and the fingers and thumb of his\r\nright hand, fitting themselves to the fingers and thumb of his left.\r\nMr Inspector moved nothing but his eyes, as he now added, raising his\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Turned you faint, sir! Seems you\xe2\x80\x99re not accustomed to this kind of\r\nwork?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stranger, who was leaning against the chimneypiece with drooping\r\nhead, looked round and answered, \xe2\x80\x98No. It\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible sight!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You expected to identify, I am told, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98HAVE you identified?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. It\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible sight. O! a horrible, horrible sight!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who did you think it might have been?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98Give us a\r\ndescription, sir. Perhaps we can help you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger; \xe2\x80\x98it would be quite useless. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Inspector had not moved, and had given no order; but, the satellite\r\nslipped his back against the wicket, and laid his left arm along the top\r\nof it, and with his right hand turned the bull\xe2\x80\x99s-eye he had taken from\r\nhis chief--in quite a casual manner--towards the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You missed a friend, you know; or you missed a foe, you know; or you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come here, you know. Well, then; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it reasonable to\r\nask, who was it?\xe2\x80\x99 Thus, Mr Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must excuse my telling you. No class of man can understand better\r\nthan you, that families may not choose to publish their disagreements\r\nand misfortunes, except on the last necessity. I do not dispute that you\r\ndischarge your duty in asking me the question; you will not dispute my\r\nright to withhold the answer. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain he turned towards the wicket, where the satellite, with his eye\r\nupon his chief, remained a dumb statue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98you will not object to leave me your\r\ncard, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not object, if I had one; but I have not.\xe2\x80\x99 He reddened and was\r\nmuch confused as he gave the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, with no change of voice or manner, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nwill not object to write down your name and address?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Inspector dipped a pen in his inkstand, and deftly laid it on a\r\npiece of paper close beside him; then resumed his former attitude.\r\nThe stranger stepped up to the desk, and wrote in a rather tremulous\r\nhand--Mr Inspector taking sidelong note of every hair of his head when\r\nit was bent down for the purpose--\xe2\x80\x98Mr Julius Handford, Exchequer Coffee\r\nHouse, Palace Yard, Westminster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Staying there, I presume, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Staying there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Consequently, from the country?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? Yes--from the country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe satellite removed his arm and opened the wicket, and Mr Julius\r\nHandford went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reserve!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98Take care of this piece of paper, keep\r\nhim in view without giving offence, ascertain that he IS staying there,\r\nand find out anything you can about him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe satellite was gone; and Mr Inspector, becoming once again the quiet\r\nAbbot of that Monastery, dipped his pen in his ink and resumed\r\nhis books. The two friends who had watched him, more amused by the\r\nprofessional manner than suspicious of Mr Julius Handford, inquired\r\nbefore taking their departure too whether he believed there was anything\r\nthat really looked bad here?\r\n\r\nThe Abbot replied with reticence, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say. If a murder, anybody\r\nmight have done it. Burglary or pocket-picking wanted \xe2\x80\x98prenticeship. Not\r\nso, murder. We were all of us up to that. Had seen scores of people come\r\nto identify, and never saw one person struck in that particular way.\r\nMight, however, have been Stomach and not Mind. If so, rum stomach.\r\nBut to be sure there were rum everythings. Pity there was not a word\r\nof truth in that superstition about bodies bleeding when touched by the\r\nhand of the right person; you never got a sign out of bodies. You got\r\nrow enough out of such as her--she was good for all night now (referring\r\nhere to the banging demands for the liver), \xe2\x80\x98but you got nothing out of\r\nbodies if it was ever so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere being nothing more to be done until the Inquest was held next day,\r\nthe friends went away together, and Gaffer Hexam and his son went their\r\nseparate way. But, arriving at the last corner, Gaffer bade his boy go\r\nhome while he turned into a red-curtained tavern, that stood dropsically\r\nbulging over the causeway, \xe2\x80\x98for a half-a-pint.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy lifted the latch he had lifted before, and found his sister\r\nagain seated before the fire at her work. Who raised her head upon his\r\ncoming in and asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did you go, Liz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went out in the dark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was no necessity for that. It was all right enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of the gentlemen, the one who didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak while I was there,\r\nlooked hard at me. And I was afraid he might know what my face meant.\r\nBut there! Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me, Charley! I was all in a tremble of another\r\nsort when you owned to father you could write a little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! But I made believe I wrote so badly, as that it was odds if any one\r\ncould read it. And when I wrote slowest and smeared but with my finger\r\nmost, father was best pleased, as he stood looking over me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl put aside her work, and drawing her seat close to his seat by\r\nthe fire, laid her arm gently on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the most of your time, Charley; won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t I? Come! I like that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Charley, yes. You work hard at your learning, I know. And I work\r\na little, Charley, and plan and contrive a little (wake out of my\r\nsleep contriving sometimes), how to get together a shilling now, and a\r\nshilling then, that shall make father believe you are beginning to earn\r\na stray living along shore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are father\xe2\x80\x99s favourite, and can make him believe anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could, Charley! For if I could make him believe that learning\r\nwas a good thing, and that we might lead better lives, I should be\r\na\xe2\x80\x99most content to die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk stuff about dying, Liz.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe placed her hands in one another on his shoulder, and laying her\r\nrich brown cheek against them as she looked down at the fire, went on\r\nthoughtfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of an evening, Charley, when you are at the school, and father\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters,\xe2\x80\x99 the boy struck in, with a\r\nbackward nod of his head towards the public-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Then as I sit a-looking at the fire, I seem to see in the burning\r\ncoal--like where that glow is now--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s gas, that is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, \xe2\x80\x98coming out of a bit of a forest\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s been under the mud that was under the water in the days of Noah\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArk. Look here! When I take the poker--so--and give it a dig--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb it, Charley, or it\xe2\x80\x99ll be all in a blaze. It\xe2\x80\x99s that dull\r\nglow near it, coming and going, that I mean. When I look at it of an\r\nevening, it comes like pictures to me, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show us a picture,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy. \xe2\x80\x98Tell us where to look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! It wants my eyes, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cut away then, and tell us what your eyes make of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, there are you and me, Charley, when you were quite a baby that\r\nnever knew a mother--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go saying I never knew a mother,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the boy, \xe2\x80\x98for I knew\r\na little sister that was sister and mother both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed delightedly, and her eyes filled with pleasant tears,\r\nas he put both his arms round her waist and so held her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are you and me, Charley, when father was away at work and locked\r\nus out, for fear we should set ourselves afire or fall out of window,\r\nsitting on the door-sill, sitting on other door-steps, sitting on the\r\nbank of the river, wandering about to get through the time. You\r\nare rather heavy to carry, Charley, and I am often obliged to rest.\r\nSometimes we are sleepy and fall asleep together in a corner, sometimes\r\nwe are very hungry, sometimes we are a little frightened, but what is\r\noftenest hard upon us is the cold. You remember, Charley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, pressing her to him twice or thrice, \xe2\x80\x98that I\r\nsnuggled under a little shawl, and it was warm there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes it rains, and we creep under a boat or the like of that:\r\nsometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s dark, and we get among the gaslights, sitting watching\r\nthe people as they go along the streets. At last, up comes father and\r\ntakes us home. And home seems such a shelter after out of doors! And\r\nfather pulls my shoes off, and dries my feet at the fire, and has me\r\nto sit by him while he smokes his pipe long after you are abed, and\r\nI notice that father\xe2\x80\x99s is a large hand but never a heavy one when it\r\ntouches me, and that father\xe2\x80\x99s is a rough voice but never an angry one\r\nwhen it speaks to me. So, I grow up, and little by little father trusts\r\nme, and makes me his companion, and, let him be put out as he may, never\r\nonce strikes me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe listening boy gave a grunt here, as much as to say \xe2\x80\x98But he strikes\r\nME though!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those are some of the pictures of what is past, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cut away again,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, \xe2\x80\x98and give us a fortune-telling one; a\r\nfuture one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! There am I, continuing with father and holding to father, because\r\nfather loves me and I love father. I can\xe2\x80\x99t so much as read a book,\r\nbecause, if I had learned, father would have thought I was deserting\r\nhim, and I should have lost my influence. I have not the influence I\r\nwant to have, I cannot stop some dreadful things I try to stop, but I\r\ngo on in the hope and trust that the time will come. In the meanwhile\r\nI know that I am in some things a stay to father, and that if I was\r\nnot faithful to him he would--in revenge-like, or in disappointment, or\r\nboth--go wild and bad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give us a touch of the fortune-telling pictures about me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was passing on to them, Charley,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, who had not changed\r\nher attitude since she began, and who now mournfully shook her head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the others were all leading up. There are you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where am I, Liz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still in the hollow down by the flare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There seems to be the deuce-and-all in the hollow down by the flare,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the boy, glancing from her eyes to the brazier, which had a grisly\r\nskeleton look on its long thin legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are you, Charley, working your way, in secret from father, at\r\nthe school; and you get prizes; and you go on better and better; and you\r\ncome to be a--what was it you called it when you told me about that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha! Fortune-telling not know the name!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the boy, seeming to\r\nbe rather relieved by this default on the part of the hollow down by the\r\nflare. \xe2\x80\x98Pupil-teacher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You come to be a pupil-teacher, and you still go on better and better,\r\nand you rise to be a master full of learning and respect. But the secret\r\nhas come to father\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge long before, and it has divided you from\r\nfather, and from me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes it has, Charley. I see, as plain as plain can be, that your way is\r\nnot ours, and that even if father could be got to forgive your taking\r\nit (which he never could be), that way of yours would be darkened by our\r\nway. But I see too, Charley--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still as plain as plain can be, Liz?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the boy playfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Still. That it is a great work to have cut you away from father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, and to have made a new and good beginning. So there am I, Charley,\r\nleft alone with father, keeping him as straight as I can, watching\r\nfor more influence than I have, and hoping that through some fortunate\r\nchance, or when he is ill, or when--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what--I may turn him to\r\nwish to do better things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read a book, Lizzie. Your library of books is the\r\nhollow down by the flare, I think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be very glad to be able to read real books. I feel my want of\r\nlearning very much, Charley. But I should feel it much more, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow it to be a tie between me and father.--Hark! Father\xe2\x80\x99s tread!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt being now past midnight, the bird of prey went straight to roost. At\r\nmid-day following he reappeared at the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, in\r\nthe character, not new to him, of a witness before a Coroner\xe2\x80\x99s Jury.\r\n\r\nMr Mortimer Lightwood, besides sustaining the character of one of the\r\nwitnesses, doubled the part with that of the eminent solicitor who\r\nwatched the proceedings on behalf of the representatives of the\r\ndeceased, as was duly recorded in the newspapers. Mr Inspector watched\r\nthe proceedings too, and kept his watching closely to himself. Mr Julius\r\nHandford having given his right address, and being reported in solvent\r\ncircumstances as to his bill, though nothing more was known of him at\r\nhis hotel except that his way of life was very retired, had no summons\r\nto appear, and was merely present in the shades of Mr Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nThe case was made interesting to the public, by Mr Mortimer Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevidence touching the circumstances under which the deceased, Mr John\r\nHarmon, had returned to England; exclusive private proprietorship in\r\nwhich circumstances was set up at dinner-tables for several days, by\r\nVeneering, Twemlow, Podsnap, and all the Buffers: who all related them\r\nirreconcilably with one another, and contradicted themselves. It was\r\nalso made interesting by the testimony of Job Potterson, the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteward, and one Mr Jacob Kibble, a fellow-passenger, that the deceased\r\nMr John Harmon did bring over, in a hand-valise with which he did\r\ndisembark, the sum realized by the forced sale of his little landed\r\nproperty, and that the sum exceeded, in ready money, seven hundred\r\npounds. It was further made interesting, by the remarkable experiences\r\nof Jesse Hexam in having rescued from the Thames so many dead bodies,\r\nand for whose behoof a rapturous admirer subscribing himself \xe2\x80\x98A friend\r\nto Burial\xe2\x80\x99 (perhaps an undertaker), sent eighteen postage stamps, and\r\nfive \xe2\x80\x98Now Sir\xe2\x80\x99s to the editor of the Times.\r\n\r\nUpon the evidence adduced before them, the Jury found, That the body\r\nof Mr John Harmon had been discovered floating in the Thames, in an\r\nadvanced state of decay, and much injured; and that the said Mr John\r\nHarmon had come by his death under highly suspicious circumstances,\r\nthough by whose act or in what precise manner there was no evidence\r\nbefore this Jury to show. And they appended to their verdict, a\r\nrecommendation to the Home Office (which Mr Inspector appeared to think\r\nhighly sensible), to offer a reward for the solution of the mystery.\r\nWithin eight-and-forty hours, a reward of One Hundred Pounds was\r\nproclaimed, together with a free pardon to any person or persons not the\r\nactual perpetrator or perpetrators, and so forth in due form.\r\n\r\nThis Proclamation rendered Mr Inspector additionally studious, and\r\ncaused him to stand meditating on river-stairs and causeways, and to go\r\nlurking about in boats, putting this and that together. But, according\r\nto the success with which you put this and that together, you get a\r\nwoman and a fish apart, or a Mermaid in combination. And Mr Inspector\r\ncould turn out nothing better than a Mermaid, which no Judge and Jury\r\nwould believe in.\r\n\r\nThus, like the tides on which it had been borne to the knowledge of men,\r\nthe Harmon Murder--as it came to be popularly called--went up and down,\r\nand ebbed and flowed, now in the town, now in the country, now among\r\npalaces, now among hovels, now among lords and ladies and gentlefolks,\r\nnow among labourers and hammerers and ballast-heavers, until at last,\r\nafter a long interval of slack water it got out to sea and drifted away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nTHE R. WILFER FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\nReginald Wilfer is a name with rather a grand sound, suggesting on\r\nfirst acquaintance brasses in country churches, scrolls in stained-glass\r\nwindows, and generally the De Wilfers who came over with the Conqueror.\r\nFor, it is a remarkable fact in genealogy that no De Any ones ever came\r\nover with Anybody else.\r\n\r\nBut, the Reginald Wilfer family were of such commonplace extraction and\r\npursuits that their forefathers had for generations modestly subsisted\r\non the Docks, the Excise Office, and the Custom House, and the existing\r\nR. Wilfer was a poor clerk. So poor a clerk, though having a limited\r\nsalary and an unlimited family, that he had never yet attained the\r\nmodest object of his ambition: which was, to wear a complete new suit\r\nof clothes, hat and boots included, at one time. His black hat was brown\r\nbefore he could afford a coat, his pantaloons were white at the seams\r\nand knees before he could buy a pair of boots, his boots had worn out\r\nbefore he could treat himself to new pantaloons, and, by the time he\r\nworked round to the hat again, that shining modern article roofed-in an\r\nancient ruin of various periods.\r\n\r\nIf the conventional Cherub could ever grow up and be clothed, he might\r\nbe photographed as a portrait of Wilfer. His chubby, smooth, innocent\r\nappearance was a reason for his being always treated with condescension\r\nwhen he was not put down. A stranger entering his own poor house at\r\nabout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock P.M. might have been surprised to find him sitting up\r\nto supper. So boyish was he in his curves and proportions, that his\r\nold schoolmaster meeting him in Cheapside, might have been unable to\r\nwithstand the temptation of caning him on the spot. In short, he was\r\nthe conventional cherub, after the supposititious shoot just mentioned,\r\nrather grey, with signs of care on his expression, and in decidedly\r\ninsolvent circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe was shy, and unwilling to own to the name of Reginald, as being too\r\naspiring and self-assertive a name. In his signature he used only the\r\ninitial R., and imparted what it really stood for, to none but chosen\r\nfriends, under the seal of confidence. Out of this, the facetious habit\r\nhad arisen in the neighbourhood surrounding Mincing Lane of making\r\nchristian names for him of adjectives and participles beginning with R.\r\nSome of these were more or less appropriate: as Rusty, Retiring, Ruddy,\r\nRound, Ripe, Ridiculous, Ruminative; others, derived their point from\r\ntheir want of application: as Raging, Rattling, Roaring, Raffish. But,\r\nhis popular name was Rumty, which in a moment of inspiration had been\r\nbestowed upon him by a gentleman of convivial habits connected with the\r\ndrug-markets, as the beginning of a social chorus, his leading part in\r\nthe execution of which had led this gentleman to the Temple of Fame, and\r\nof which the whole expressive burden ran:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Rumty iddity, row dow dow,\r\n     Sing toodlely, teedlely, bow wow wow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus he was constantly addressed, even in minor notes on business, as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Rumty\xe2\x80\x99; in answer to which, he sedately signed himself, \xe2\x80\x98Yours\r\ntruly, R. Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was clerk in the drug-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles.\r\nChicksey and Stobbles, his former masters, had both become absorbed in\r\nVeneering, once their traveller or commission agent: who had signalized\r\nhis accession to supreme power by bringing into the business a quantity\r\nof plate-glass window and French-polished mahogany partition, and a\r\ngleaming and enormous doorplate.\r\n\r\nR. Wilfer locked up his desk one evening, and, putting his bunch of keys\r\nin his pocket much as if it were his peg-top, made for home. His home\r\nwas in the Holloway region north of London, and then divided from it by\r\nfields and trees. Between Battle Bridge and that part of the Holloway\r\ndistrict in which he dwelt, was a tract of suburban Sahara, where tiles\r\nand bricks were burnt, bones were boiled, carpets were beat, rubbish was\r\nshot, dogs were fought, and dust was heaped by contractors. Skirting\r\nthe border of this desert, by the way he took, when the light of its\r\nkiln-fires made lurid smears on the fog, R. Wilfer sighed and shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah me!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98what might have been is not what is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith which commentary on human life, indicating an experience of it\r\nnot exclusively his own, he made the best of his way to the end of his\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer was, of course, a tall woman and an angular. Her lord being\r\ncherubic, she was necessarily majestic, according to the principle which\r\nmatrimonially unites contrasts. She was much given to tying up her head\r\nin a pocket-handkerchief, knotted under the chin. This head-gear, in\r\nconjunction with a pair of gloves worn within doors, she seemed to\r\nconsider as at once a kind of armour against misfortune (invariably\r\nassuming it when in low spirits or difficulties), and as a species of\r\nfull dress. It was therefore with some sinking of the spirit that her\r\nhusband beheld her thus heroically attired, putting down her candle in\r\nthe little hall, and coming down the doorsteps through the little front\r\ncourt to open the gate for him.\r\n\r\nSomething had gone wrong with the house-door, for R. Wilfer stopped on\r\nthe steps, staring at it, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hal-loa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98the man came himself with a pair of pincers,\r\nand took it off, and took it away. He said that as he had no expectation\r\nof ever being paid for it, and as he had an order for another LADIES\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSCHOOL door-plate, it was better (burnished up) for the interests of all\r\nparties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps it was, my dear; what do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are master here, R. W.,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his wife. \xe2\x80\x98It is as you think;\r\nnot as I do. Perhaps it might have been better if the man had taken the\r\ndoor too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done without the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my dear! Could we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is as you think, R. W.; not as I do.\xe2\x80\x99 With those submissive words,\r\nthe dutiful wife preceded him down a few stairs to a little basement\r\nfront room, half kitchen, half parlour, where a girl of about nineteen,\r\nwith an exceedingly pretty figure and face, but with an impatient and\r\npetulant expression both in her face and in her shoulders (which in\r\nher sex and at her age are very expressive of discontent), sat playing\r\ndraughts with a younger girl, who was the youngest of the House of\r\nWilfer. Not to encumber this page by telling off the Wilfers in detail\r\nand casting them up in the gross, it is enough for the present that the\r\nrest were what is called \xe2\x80\x98out in the world,\xe2\x80\x99 in various ways, and that\r\nthey were Many. So many, that when one of his dutiful children called in\r\nto see him, R. Wilfer generally seemed to say to himself, after a little\r\nmental arithmetic, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! here\xe2\x80\x99s another of \xe2\x80\x98em!\xe2\x80\x99 before adding aloud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How de do, John,\xe2\x80\x99 or Susan, as the case might be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well Piggywiggies,\xe2\x80\x99 said R. W., \xe2\x80\x98how de do to-night? What I was\r\nthinking of, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 to Mrs Wilfer already seated in a corner with\r\nfolded gloves, \xe2\x80\x98was, that as we have let our first floor so well, and as\r\nwe have now no place in which you could teach pupils even if pupils--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The milkman said he knew of two young ladies of the highest\r\nrespectability who were in search of a suitable establishment, and he\r\ntook a card,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mrs Wilfer, with severe monotony, as if she\r\nwere reading an Act of Parliament aloud. \xe2\x80\x98Tell your father whether it\r\nwas last Monday, Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we never heard any more of it, ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, the elder girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In addition to which, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 her husband urged, \xe2\x80\x98if you have no\r\nplace to put two young persons into--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer again interposed; \xe2\x80\x98they were not young persons.\r\nTwo young ladies of the highest respectability. Tell your father, Bella,\r\nwhether the milkman said so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, it is the same thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No it is not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, with the same impressive monotony.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, my dear, it is the same thing as to space. As to space. If you\r\nhave no space in which to put two youthful fellow-creatures, however\r\neminently respectable, which I do not doubt, where are those youthful\r\nfellow-creatures to be accommodated? I carry it no further than that.\r\nAnd solely looking at it,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, making the stipulation at\r\nonce in a conciliatory, complimentary, and argumentative tone--\xe2\x80\x98as I am\r\nsure you will agree, my love--from a fellow-creature point of view, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have nothing more to say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, with a meek\r\nrenunciatory action of her gloves. \xe2\x80\x98It is as you think, R. W.; not as I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, the huffing of Miss Bella and the loss of three of her men at a\r\nswoop, aggravated by the coronation of an opponent, led to that young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s jerking the draught-board and pieces off the table: which her\r\nsister went down on her knees to pick up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Bella!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And poor Lavinia, perhaps, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested R. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was one of the worthy woman\xe2\x80\x99s specialities that she had an amazing\r\npower of gratifying her splenetic or worldly-minded humours by extolling\r\nher own family: which she thus proceeded, in the present case, to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, R. W. Lavinia has not known the trial that Bella has known. The\r\ntrial that your daughter Bella has undergone, is, perhaps, without\r\na parallel, and has been borne, I will say, Nobly. When you see your\r\ndaughter Bella in her black dress, which she alone of all the family\r\nwears, and when you remember the circumstances which have led to\r\nher wearing it, and when you know how those circumstances have been\r\nsustained, then, R. W., lay your head upon your pillow and say, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor\r\nLavinia!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, Miss Lavinia, from her kneeling situation under the table, put in\r\nthat she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be \xe2\x80\x98poored by pa\xe2\x80\x99, or anybody else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure you do not, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her mother, \xe2\x80\x98for you have a\r\nfine brave spirit. And your sister Cecilia has a fine brave spirit\r\nof another kind, a spirit of pure devotion, a beau-ti-ful spirit! The\r\nself-sacrifice of Cecilia reveals a pure and womanly character, very\r\nseldom equalled, never surpassed. I have now in my pocket a letter from\r\nyour sister Cecilia, received this morning--received three months after\r\nher marriage, poor child!--in which she tells me that her husband must\r\nunexpectedly shelter under their roof his reduced aunt. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I will be\r\ntrue to him, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d she touchingly writes, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not leave him, I\r\nmust not forget that he is my husband. Let his aunt come!\xe2\x80\x9d If this is\r\nnot pathetic, if this is not woman\xe2\x80\x99s devotion--!\xe2\x80\x99 The good lady waved\r\nher gloves in a sense of the impossibility of saying more, and tied the\r\npocket-handkerchief over her head in a tighter knot under her chin.\r\n\r\nBella, who was now seated on the rug to warm herself, with her brown\r\neyes on the fire and a handful of her brown curls in her mouth, laughed\r\nat this, and then pouted and half cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98though you have no feeling for me, pa, I am one\r\nof the most unfortunate girls that ever lived. You know how poor we are\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(it is probable he did, having some reason to know it!), \xe2\x80\x98and what a\r\nglimpse of wealth I had, and how it melted away, and how I am here in\r\nthis ridiculous mourning--which I hate!--a kind of a widow who never was\r\nmarried. And yet you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel for me.--Yes you do, yes you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis abrupt change was occasioned by her father\xe2\x80\x99s face. She stopped\r\nto pull him down from his chair in an attitude highly favourable to\r\nstrangulation, and to give him a kiss and a pat or two on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you ought to feel for me, you know, pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and I say you ought to. If they had only left me alone and told\r\nme nothing about it, it would have mattered much less. But that nasty Mr\r\nLightwood feels it his duty, as he says, to write and tell me what is in\r\nreserve for me, and then I am obliged to get rid of George Sampson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, Lavinia, rising to the surface with the last draughtman rescued,\r\ninterposed, \xe2\x80\x98You never cared for George Sampson, Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did I say I did, miss?\xe2\x80\x99 Then, pouting again, with the curls in her\r\nmouth; \xe2\x80\x98George Sampson was very fond of me, and admired me very much,\r\nand put up with everything I did to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were rude enough to him,\xe2\x80\x99 Lavinia again interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did I say I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, miss? I am not setting up to be sentimental\r\nabout George Sampson. I only say George Sampson was better than\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t show him that you thought even that,\xe2\x80\x99 Lavinia again\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a chit and a little idiot,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, \xe2\x80\x98or you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake such a dolly speech. What did you expect me to do? Wait till you\r\nare a woman, and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about what you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. You only\r\nshow your ignorance!\xe2\x80\x99 Then, whimpering again, and at intervals biting\r\nthe curls, and stopping to look how much was bitten off, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame!\r\nThere never was such a hard case! I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care so much if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nso ridiculous. It was ridiculous enough to have a stranger coming over\r\nto marry me, whether he liked it or not. It was ridiculous enough to\r\nknow what an embarrassing meeting it would be, and how we never\r\ncould pretend to have an inclination of our own, either of us. It was\r\nridiculous enough to know I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like him--how COULD I like him,\r\nleft to him in a will, like a dozen of spoons, with everything cut and\r\ndried beforehand, like orange chips. Talk of orange flowers indeed!\r\nI declare again it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame! Those ridiculous points would have been\r\nsmoothed away by the money, for I love money, and want money--want it\r\ndreadfully. I hate to be poor, and we are degradingly poor, offensively\r\npoor, miserably poor, beastly poor. But here I am, left with all the\r\nridiculous parts of the situation remaining, and, added to them all,\r\nthis ridiculous dress! And if the truth was known, when the Harmon\r\nmurder was all over the town, and people were speculating on its being\r\nsuicide, I dare say those impudent wretches at the clubs and places made\r\njokes about the miserable creature\xe2\x80\x99s having preferred a watery grave to\r\nme. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely enough they took such liberties; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder! I\r\ndeclare it\xe2\x80\x99s a very hard case indeed, and I am a most unfortunate girl.\r\nThe idea of being a kind of a widow, and never having been married!\r\nAnd the idea of being as poor as ever after all, and going into black,\r\nbesides, for a man I never saw, and should have hated--as far as HE was\r\nconcerned--if I had seen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young lady\xe2\x80\x99s lamentations were checked at this point by a knuckle,\r\nknocking at the half-open door of the room. The knuckle had knocked two\r\nor three times already, but had not been heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, in her Act-of-Parliament manner. \xe2\x80\x98Enter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA gentleman coming in, Miss Bella, with a short and sharp exclamation,\r\nscrambled off the hearth-rug and massed the bitten curls together in\r\ntheir right place on her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The servant girl had her key in the door as I came up, and directed me\r\nto this room, telling me I was expected. I am afraid I should have asked\r\nher to announce me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Not at all. Two of my daughters. R.\r\nW., this is the gentleman who has taken your first-floor. He was so good\r\nas to make an appointment for to-night, when you would be at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA dark gentleman. Thirty at the utmost. An expressive, one might say\r\nhandsome, face. A very bad manner. In the last degree constrained,\r\nreserved, diffident, troubled. His eyes were on Miss Bella for an\r\ninstant, and then looked at the ground as he addressed the master of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seeing that I am quite satisfied, Mr Wilfer, with the rooms, and with\r\ntheir situation, and with their price, I suppose a memorandum between us\r\nof two or three lines, and a payment down, will bind the bargain? I wish\r\nto send in furniture without delay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwo or three times during this short address, the cherub addressed had\r\nmade chubby motions towards a chair. The gentleman now took it, laying\r\na hesitating hand on a corner of the table, and with another hesitating\r\nhand lifting the crown of his hat to his lips, and drawing it before his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentleman, R. W.,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98proposes to take your\r\napartments by the quarter. A quarter\xe2\x80\x99s notice on either side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I mention, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 insinuated the landlord, expecting it to be\r\nreceived as a matter of course, \xe2\x80\x98the form of a reference?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the gentleman, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x98that a reference is\r\nnot necessary; neither, to say the truth, is it convenient, for I am\r\na stranger in London. I require no reference from you, and perhaps,\r\ntherefore, you will require none from me. That will be fair on both\r\nsides. Indeed, I show the greater confidence of the two, for I will pay\r\nin advance whatever you please, and I am going to trust my furniture\r\nhere. Whereas, if you were in embarrassed circumstances--this is merely\r\nsupposititious--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nConscience causing R. Wilfer to colour, Mrs Wilfer, from a corner (she\r\nalways got into stately corners) came to the rescue with a deep-toned\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Per-fectly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Why then I--might lose it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 observed R. Wilfer, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x98money and goods are certainly\r\nthe best of references.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think they ARE the best, pa?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Bella, in a low voice,\r\nand without looking over her shoulder as she warmed her foot on the\r\nfender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Among the best, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have thought, myself, it was so easy to add the usual kind of\r\none,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with a toss of her curls.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman listened to her, with a face of marked attention, though\r\nhe neither looked up nor changed his attitude. He sat, still and silent,\r\nuntil his future landlord accepted his proposals, and brought writing\r\nmaterials to complete the business. He sat, still and silent, while the\r\nlandlord wrote.\r\n\r\nWhen the agreement was ready in duplicate (the landlord having worked\r\nat it like some cherubic scribe, in what is conventionally called a\r\ndoubtful, which means a not at all doubtful, Old Master), it was signed\r\nby the contracting parties, Bella looking on as scornful witness. The\r\ncontracting parties were R. Wilfer, and John Rokesmith Esquire.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to Bella\xe2\x80\x99s turn to sign her name, Mr Rokesmith, who was\r\nstanding, as he had sat, with a hesitating hand upon the table, looked\r\nat her stealthily, but narrowly. He looked at the pretty figure bending\r\ndown over the paper and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Where am I to go, pa? Here, in this\r\ncorner?\xe2\x80\x99 He looked at the beautiful brown hair, shading the coquettish\r\nface; he looked at the free dash of the signature, which was a bold one\r\nfor a woman\xe2\x80\x99s; and then they looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much obliged to you, Miss Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Obliged?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have given you so much trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Signing my name? Yes, certainly. But I am your landlord\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs there was nothing more to do but pay eight sovereigns in earnest of\r\nthe bargain, pocket the agreement, appoint a time for the arrival of his\r\nfurniture and himself, and go, Mr Rokesmith did that as awkwardly as it\r\nmight be done, and was escorted by his landlord to the outer air. When\r\nR. Wilfer returned, candlestick in hand, to the bosom of his family, he\r\nfound the bosom agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98we have got a Murderer for a tenant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia, \xe2\x80\x98we have got a Robber.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To see him unable for his life to look anybody in the face!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella. \xe2\x80\x98There never was such an exhibition.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dears,\xe2\x80\x99 said their father, \xe2\x80\x98he is a diffident gentleman, and I\r\nshould say particularly so in the society of girls of your age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, our age!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that got to do\r\nwith him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides, we are not of the same age:--which age?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Lavinia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never YOU mind, Lavvy,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bella; \xe2\x80\x98you wait till you are of an\r\nage to ask such questions. Pa, mark my words! Between Mr Rokesmith and\r\nme, there is a natural antipathy and a deep distrust; and something will\r\ncome of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, and girls,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub-patriarch, \xe2\x80\x98between Mr Rokesmith\r\nand me, there is a matter of eight sovereigns, and something for supper\r\nshall come of it, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree upon the article.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was a neat and happy turn to give the subject, treats being rare in\r\nthe Wilfer household, where a monotonous appearance of Dutch-cheese at\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening had been rather frequently commented on by\r\nthe dimpled shoulders of Miss Bella. Indeed, the modest Dutchman himself\r\nseemed conscious of his want of variety, and generally came before the\r\nfamily in a state of apologetic perspiration. After some discussion on\r\nthe relative merits of veal-cutlet, sweetbread, and lobster, a decision\r\nwas pronounced in favour of veal-cutlet. Mrs Wilfer then solemnly\r\ndivested herself of her handkerchief and gloves, as a preliminary\r\nsacrifice to preparing the frying-pan, and R. W. himself went out\r\nto purchase the viand. He soon returned, bearing the same in a fresh\r\ncabbage-leaf, where it coyly embraced a rasher of ham. Melodious sounds\r\nwere not long in rising from the frying-pan on the fire, or in seeming,\r\nas the firelight danced in the mellow halls of a couple of full bottles\r\non the table, to play appropriate dance-music.\r\n\r\nThe cloth was laid by Lavvy. Bella, as the acknowledged ornament of the\r\nfamily, employed both her hands in giving her hair an additional\r\nwave while sitting in the easiest chair, and occasionally threw in a\r\ndirection touching the supper: as, \xe2\x80\x98Very brown, ma;\xe2\x80\x99 or, to her sister,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put the saltcellar straight, miss, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be a dowdy little puss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMeantime her father, chinking Mr Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s gold as he sat expectant\r\nbetween his knife and fork, remarked that six of those sovereigns came\r\njust in time for their landlord, and stood them in a little pile on the\r\nwhite tablecloth to look at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate our landlord!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\nBut, observing a fall in her father\xe2\x80\x99s face, she went and sat down by him\r\nat the table, and began touching up his hair with the handle of a fork.\r\nIt was one of the girl\xe2\x80\x99s spoilt ways to be always arranging the family\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair--perhaps because her own was so pretty, and occupied so much of her\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You deserve to have a house of your own; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, poor pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it better than another, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate I, for one, want it more than another,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, holding\r\nhim by the chin, as she stuck his flaxen hair on end, \xe2\x80\x98and I grudge\r\nthis money going to the Monster that swallows up so much, when we all\r\nwant--Everything. And if you say (as you want to say; I know you want\r\nto say so, pa) \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s neither reasonable nor honest, Bella,\xe2\x80\x9d then I\r\nanswer, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe not, pa--very likely--but it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the consequences\r\nof being poor, and of thoroughly hating and detesting to be poor, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s my case.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, you look lovely, pa; why don\xe2\x80\x99t you always wear\r\nyour hair like that? And here\xe2\x80\x99s the cutlet! If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t very brown, ma,\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t eat it, and must have a bit put back to be done expressly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, as it was brown, even to Bella\xe2\x80\x99s taste, the young lady\r\ngraciously partook of it without reconsignment to the frying-pan, and\r\nalso, in due course, of the contents of the two bottles: whereof\r\none held Scotch ale and the other rum. The latter perfume, with\r\nthe fostering aid of boiling water and lemon-peel, diffused itself\r\nthroughout the room, and became so highly concentrated around the warm\r\nfireside, that the wind passing over the house roof must have rushed off\r\ncharged with a delicious whiff of it, after buzzing like a great bee at\r\nthat particular chimneypot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, sipping the fragrant mixture and warming her favourite\r\nankle; \xe2\x80\x98when old Mr Harmon made such a fool of me (not to mention\r\nhimself, as he is dead), what do you suppose he did it for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible to say, my dear. As I have told you time out of number since\r\nhis will was brought to light, I doubt if I ever exchanged a hundred\r\nwords with the old gentleman. If it was his whim to surprise us, his\r\nwhim succeeded. For he certainly did it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I was stamping my foot and screaming, when he first took notice of\r\nme; was I?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, contemplating the ankle before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were stamping your little foot, my dear, and screaming with your\r\nlittle voice, and laying into me with your little bonnet, which you\r\nhad snatched off for the purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her father, as if the\r\nremembrance gave a relish to the rum; \xe2\x80\x98you were doing this one Sunday\r\nmorning when I took you out, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go the exact way you\r\nwanted, when the old gentleman, sitting on a seat near, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nnice girl; that\xe2\x80\x99s a VERY nice girl; a promising girl!\xe2\x80\x9d And so you were,\r\nmy dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then he asked my name, did he, pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he asked your name, my dear, and mine; and on other Sunday\r\nmornings, when we walked his way, we saw him again, and--and really\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs that was all the rum and water too, or, in other words, as R. W.\r\ndelicately signified that his glass was empty, by throwing back his head\r\nand standing the glass upside down on his nose and upper lip, it might\r\nhave been charitable in Mrs Wilfer to suggest replenishment. But that\r\nheroine briefly suggesting \xe2\x80\x98Bedtime\xe2\x80\x99 instead, the bottles were put away,\r\nand the family retired; she cherubically escorted, like some severe\r\nsaint in a painting, or merely human matron allegorically treated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And by this time to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia when the two girls were alone\r\nin their room, \xe2\x80\x98we shall have Mr Rokesmith here, and shall be expecting\r\nto have our throats cut.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t stand between me and the candle for all that,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted\r\nBella. \xe2\x80\x98This is another of the consequences of being poor! The idea of a\r\ngirl with a really fine head of hair, having to do it by one flat candle\r\nand a few inches of looking-glass!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You caught George Sampson with it, Bella, bad as your means of dressing\r\nit are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You low little thing. Caught George Sampson with it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about\r\ncatching people, miss, till your own time for catching--as you call\r\nit--comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps it has come,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Lavvy, with a toss of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, very sharply. \xe2\x80\x98What did you say, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLavvy declining equally to repeat or to explain, Bella gradually lapsed\r\nover her hair-dressing into a soliloquy on the miseries of being poor,\r\nas exemplified in having nothing to put on, nothing to go out in,\r\nnothing to dress by, only a nasty box to dress at instead of a\r\ncommodious dressing-table, and being obliged to take in suspicious\r\nlodgers. On the last grievance as her climax, she laid great stress--and\r\nmight have laid greater, had she known that if Mr Julius Handford had a\r\ntwin brother upon earth, Mr John Rokesmith was the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nBOFFIN\xe2\x80\x99S BOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nOver against a London house, a corner house not far from Cavendish\r\nSquare, a man with a wooden leg had sat for some years, with his\r\nremaining foot in a basket in cold weather, picking up a living on\r\nthis wise:--Every morning at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he stumped to the corner,\r\ncarrying a chair, a clothes-horse, a pair of trestles, a board, a\r\nbasket, and an umbrella, all strapped together. Separating these, the\r\nboard and trestles became a counter, the basket supplied the few small\r\nlots of fruit and sweets that he offered for sale upon it and became a\r\nfoot-warmer, the unfolded clothes-horse displayed a choice collection of\r\nhalfpenny ballads and became a screen, and the stool planted within it\r\nbecame his post for the rest of the day. All weathers saw the man at the\r\npost. This is to be accepted in a double sense, for he contrived a\r\nback to his wooden stool, by placing it against the lamp-post. When the\r\nweather was wet, he put up his umbrella over his stock in trade, not\r\nover himself; when the weather was dry, he furled that faded article,\r\ntied it round with a piece of yarn, and laid it cross-wise under the\r\ntrestles: where it looked like an unwholesomely-forced lettuce that had\r\nlost in colour and crispness what it had gained in size.\r\n\r\nHe had established his right to the corner, by imperceptible\r\nprescription. He had never varied his ground an inch, but had in the\r\nbeginning diffidently taken the corner upon which the side of the house\r\ngave. A howling corner in the winter time, a dusty corner in the summer\r\ntime, an undesirable corner at the best of times. Shelterless fragments\r\nof straw and paper got up revolving storms there, when the main street\r\nwas at peace; and the water-cart, as if it were drunk or short-sighted,\r\ncame blundering and jolting round it, making it muddy when all else was\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nOn the front of his sale-board hung a little placard, like a\r\nkettle-holder, bearing the inscription in his own small text:\r\n\r\n     Errands gone\r\n     On with fi\r\n     Delity By\r\n     Ladies and Gentlemen\r\n     I remain\r\n     Your humble Servt:\r\n     Silas Wegg\r\n\r\nHe had not only settled it with himself in course of time, that he\r\nwas errand-goer by appointment to the house at the corner (though he\r\nreceived such commissions not half a dozen times in a year, and then\r\nonly as some servant\xe2\x80\x99s deputy), but also that he was one of the house\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretainers and owed vassalage to it and was bound to leal and loyal\r\ninterest in it. For this reason, he always spoke of it as \xe2\x80\x98Our House,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand, though his knowledge of its affairs was mostly speculative and\r\nall wrong, claimed to be in its confidence. On similar grounds he never\r\nbeheld an inmate at any one of its windows but he touched his hat. Yet,\r\nhe knew so little about the inmates that he gave them names of his own\r\ninvention: as \xe2\x80\x98Miss Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Master George\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Aunt Jane\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\r\nParker \xe2\x80\x98--having no authority whatever for any such designations, but\r\nparticularly the last--to which, as a natural consequence, he stuck with\r\ngreat obstinacy.\r\n\r\nOver the house itself, he exercised the same imaginary power as over its\r\ninhabitants and their affairs. He had never been in it, the length of\r\na piece of fat black water-pipe which trailed itself over the area-door\r\ninto a damp stone passage, and had rather the air of a leech on the\r\nhouse that had \xe2\x80\x98taken\xe2\x80\x99 wonderfully; but this was no impediment to his\r\narranging it according to a plan of his own. It was a great dingy house\r\nwith a quantity of dim side window and blank back premises, and it\r\ncost his mind a world of trouble so to lay it out as to account for\r\neverything in its external appearance. But, this once done, was quite\r\nsatisfactory, and he rested persuaded, that he knew his way about the\r\nhouse blindfold: from the barred garrets in the high roof, to the two\r\niron extinguishers before the main door--which seemed to request all\r\nlively visitors to have the kindness to put themselves out, before\r\nentering.\r\n\r\nAssuredly, this stall of Silas Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s was the hardest little stall of\r\nall the sterile little stalls in London. It gave you the face-ache\r\nto look at his apples, the stomach-ache to look at his oranges, the\r\ntooth-ache to look at his nuts. Of the latter commodity he had always\r\na grim little heap, on which lay a little wooden measure which had\r\nno discernible inside, and was considered to represent the penn\xe2\x80\x99orth\r\nappointed by Magna Charta. Whether from too much east wind or no--it was\r\nan easterly corner--the stall, the stock, and the keeper, were all as\r\ndry as the Desert. Wegg was a knotty man, and a close-grained, with a\r\nface carved out of very hard material, that had just as much play\r\nof expression as a watchman\xe2\x80\x99s rattle. When he laughed, certain jerks\r\noccurred in it, and the rattle sprung. Sooth to say, he was so wooden\r\na man that he seemed to have taken his wooden leg naturally, and rather\r\nsuggested to the fanciful observer, that he might be expected--if his\r\ndevelopment received no untimely check--to be completely set up with a\r\npair of wooden legs in about six months.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg was an observant person, or, as he himself said, \xe2\x80\x98took a\r\npowerful sight of notice\xe2\x80\x99. He saluted all his regular passers-by every\r\nday, as he sat on his stool backed up by the lamp-post; and on the\r\nadaptable character of these salutes he greatly plumed himself. Thus,\r\nto the rector, he addressed a bow, compounded of lay deference, and\r\na slight touch of the shady preliminary meditation at church; to the\r\ndoctor, a confidential bow, as to a gentleman whose acquaintance with\r\nhis inside he begged respectfully to acknowledge; before the Quality he\r\ndelighted to abase himself; and for Uncle Parker, who was in the army\r\n(at least, so he had settled it), he put his open hand to the side\r\nof his hat, in a military manner which that angry-eyed buttoned-up\r\ninflammatory-faced old gentleman appeared but imperfectly to appreciate.\r\n\r\nThe only article in which Silas dealt, that was not hard, was\r\ngingerbread. On a certain day, some wretched infant having purchased the\r\ndamp gingerbread-horse (fearfully out of condition), and the adhesive\r\nbird-cage, which had been exposed for the day\xe2\x80\x99s sale, he had taken a tin\r\nbox from under his stool to produce a relay of those dreadful specimens,\r\nand was going to look in at the lid, when he said to himself, pausing:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Here you are again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words referred to a broad, round-shouldered, one-sided old fellow in\r\nmourning, coming comically ambling towards the corner, dressed in a pea\r\nover-coat, and carrying a large stick. He wore thick shoes, and thick\r\nleather gaiters, and thick gloves like a hedger\xe2\x80\x99s. Both as to his dress\r\nand to himself, he was of an overlapping rhinoceros build, with folds\r\nin his cheeks, and his forehead, and his eyelids, and his lips, and his\r\nears; but with bright, eager, childishly-inquiring, grey eyes, under his\r\nragged eyebrows, and broad-brimmed hat. A very odd-looking old fellow\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here you are again,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Wegg, musing. \xe2\x80\x98And what are you now?\r\nAre you in the Funns, or where are you? Have you lately come to settle\r\nin this neighbourhood, or do you own to another neighbourhood? Are you\r\nin independent circumstances, or is it wasting the motions of a bow on\r\nyou? Come! I\xe2\x80\x99ll speculate! I\xe2\x80\x99ll invest a bow in you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhich Mr Wegg, having replaced his tin box, accordingly did, as he rose\r\nto bait his gingerbread-trap for some other devoted infant. The salute\r\nwas acknowledged with:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Morning, sir! Morning! Morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Calls me Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, to himself; \xe2\x80\x98HE won\xe2\x80\x99t answer. A bow\r\ngone!\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Morning, morning, morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Appears to be rather a \xe2\x80\x98arty old cock, too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, as before;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning to YOU, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember me, then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked his new acquaintance, stopping in\r\nhis amble, one-sided, before the stall, and speaking in a pounding way,\r\nthough with great good-humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have noticed you go past our house, sir, several times in the course\r\nof the last week or so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our house,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the other. \xe2\x80\x98Meaning--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, nodding, as the other pointed the clumsy forefinger\r\nof his right glove at the corner house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Now, what,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the old fellow, in an inquisitive manner,\r\ncarrying his knotted stick in his left arm as if it were a baby, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\ndo they allow you now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s job work that I do for our house,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Silas, drily, and with\r\nreticence; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet brought to an exact allowance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s not yet brought to an exact allowance? No! It\xe2\x80\x99s not yet\r\nbrought to an exact allowance. Oh!--Morning, morning, morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Appears to be rather a cracked old cock,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Silas, qualifying his\r\nformer good opinion, as the other ambled off. But, in a moment he was\r\nback again with the question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you get your wooden leg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg replied, (tartly to this personal inquiry), \xe2\x80\x98In an accident.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got to keep it warm,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg made answer, in a sort of\r\ndesperation occasioned by the singularity of the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the other to his knotted stick, as he gave it a\r\nhug; \xe2\x80\x98he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got--ha!--ha!--to keep it warm! Did you ever hear of the\r\nname of Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, who was growing restive under this examination. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nnever did hear of the name of Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, no,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Wegg, again approaching desperation; \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nI do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Wegg, approaching frenzy, \xe2\x80\x98but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something that\xe2\x80\x99ll make you sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nstranger, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98My name\xe2\x80\x99s Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Wegg. Implying in his manner the\r\noffensive addition, \xe2\x80\x98and if I could, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there\xe2\x80\x99s another chance for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, smiling still, \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\nyou like the name of Nicodemus? Think it over. Nick, or Noddy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg rejoined, as he sat down on his stool, with an\r\nair of gentle resignation, combined with melancholy candour; \xe2\x80\x98it is not\r\na name as I could wish any one that I had a respect for, to call ME\r\nby; but there may be persons that would not view it with the same\r\nobjections.--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg added, anticipating another\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noddy Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98Noddy. That\xe2\x80\x99s my name. Noddy--or\r\nNick--Boffin. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silas Wegg.--I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, bestirring himself to take the\r\nsame precaution as before, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why Silas, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why\r\nWegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, hugging his stick closer, \xe2\x80\x98I want to make a\r\nsort of offer to you. Do you remember when you first see me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wooden Wegg looked at him with a meditative eye, and also with a\r\nsoftened air as descrying possibility of profit. \xe2\x80\x98Let me think. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite sure, and yet I generally take a powerful sight of notice, too.\r\nWas it on a Monday morning, when the butcher-boy had been to our house\r\nfor orders, and bought a ballad of me, which, being unacquainted with\r\nthe tune, I run it over to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right, Wegg, right! But he bought more than one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, to be sure, sir; he bought several; and wishing to lay out his\r\nmoney to the best, he took my opinion to guide his choice, and we went\r\nover the collection together. To be sure we did. Here was him as it\r\nmight be, and here was myself as it might be, and there was you, Mr\r\nBoffin, as you identically are, with your self-same stick under your\r\nvery same arm, and your very same back towards us. To--be--sure!\xe2\x80\x99 added\r\nMr Wegg, looking a little round Mr Boffin, to take him in the rear,\r\nand identify this last extraordinary coincidence, \xe2\x80\x98your wery self-same\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think I was doing, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should judge, sir, that you might be glancing your eye down the\r\nstreet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Wegg. I was a listening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was you, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in a dishonourable way, Wegg, because you was singing to the\r\nbutcher; and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sing secrets to a butcher in the street, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It never happened that I did so yet, to the best of my remembrance,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr Wegg, cautiously. \xe2\x80\x98But I might do it. A man can\xe2\x80\x99t say what he\r\nmight wish to do some day or another.\xe2\x80\x99 (This, not to release any little\r\nadvantage he might derive from Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s avowal.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I was a listening to you and to him. And what\r\ndo you--you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got another stool, have you? I\xe2\x80\x99m rather thick in my\r\nbreath.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got another, but you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg,\r\nresigning it. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a treat to me to stand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lard!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr Boffin, in a tone of great enjoyment, as he settled\r\nhimself down, still nursing his stick like a baby, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasant\r\nplace, this! And then to be shut in on each side, with these ballads,\r\nlike so many book-leaf blinkers! Why, its delightful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I am not mistaken, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg delicately hinted, resting a hand\r\non his stall, and bending over the discursive Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98you alluded to\r\nsome offer or another that was in your mind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to it! All right. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to it! I was going to say that\r\nwhen I listened that morning, I listened with hadmiration amounting to\r\nhaw. I thought to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a man with a wooden leg--a literary\r\nman with--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N--not exactly so, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you know every one of these songs by name and by tune, and if you\r\nwant to read or to sing any one on \xe2\x80\x98em off straight, you\xe2\x80\x99ve only to whip\r\non your spectacles and do it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I see you at it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Wegg, with a conscious inclination of the head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll say literary, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cA literary man--WITH a wooden leg--and all Print is open to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought to myself, that morning,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin,\r\nleaning forward to describe, uncramped by the clotheshorse, as large an\r\narc as his right arm could make; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9call Print is open to him!\xe2\x80\x9d And it is,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, truly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg admitted, with modesty; \xe2\x80\x98I believe you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t show me the piece of English print, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be equal to\r\ncollaring and throwing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the spot?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the spot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know\xe2\x80\x99d it! Then consider this. Here am I, a man without a wooden leg,\r\nand yet all print is shut to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg returned with increasing self-complacency.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Education neglected?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neg--lected!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Boffin, with emphasis. \xe2\x80\x98That ain\xe2\x80\x99t no word for\r\nit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say but what if you showed me a B, I could so far\r\ngive you change for it, as to answer Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, throwing in a little encouragement,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s something, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s something,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not as much as could be wished by an inquiring mind, sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Wegg admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, look here. I\xe2\x80\x99m retired from business. Me and Mrs\r\nBoffin--Henerietty Boffin--which her father\xe2\x80\x99s name was Henery, and her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s name was Hetty, and so you get it--we live on a compittance,\r\nunder the will of a diseased governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentleman dead, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Man alive, don\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you? A diseased governor? Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s too late\r\nfor me to begin shovelling and sifting at alphabeds and grammar-books.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m getting to be a old bird, and I want to take it easy. But I want\r\nsome reading--some fine bold reading, some splendid book in a gorging\r\nLord-Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s-Show of wollumes\xe2\x80\x99 (probably meaning gorgeous, but misled\r\nby association of ideas); \xe2\x80\x98as\xe2\x80\x99ll reach right down your pint of view, and\r\ntake time to go by you. How can I get that reading, Wegg? By,\xe2\x80\x99 tapping\r\nhim on the breast with the head of his thick stick, \xe2\x80\x98paying a man truly\r\nqualified to do it, so much an hour (say twopence) to come and do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem! Flattered, sir, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, beginning to regard himself\r\nin quite a new light. \xe2\x80\x98Hew! This is the offer you mentioned, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am considering of it, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Boffin, in a free-handed manner, \xe2\x80\x98want to tie a literary\r\nman--WITH a wooden leg--down too tight. A halfpenny an hour shan\xe2\x80\x99t part\r\nus. The hours are your own to choose, after you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for the day\r\nwith your house here. I live over Maiden-Lane way--out Holloway\r\ndirection--and you\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to go East-and-by-North when you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfinished here, and you\xe2\x80\x99re there. Twopence halfpenny an hour,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBoffin, taking a piece of chalk from his pocket and getting off the\r\nstool to work the sum on the top of it in his own way; \xe2\x80\x98two long\xe2\x80\x99uns and\r\na short\xe2\x80\x99un--twopence halfpenny; two short\xe2\x80\x99uns is a long\xe2\x80\x99un and two two\r\nlong\xe2\x80\x99uns is four long\xe2\x80\x99uns--making five long\xe2\x80\x99uns; six nights a week at\r\nfive long\xe2\x80\x99uns a night,\xe2\x80\x99 scoring them all down separately, \xe2\x80\x98and you mount\r\nup to thirty long\xe2\x80\x99uns. A round\xe2\x80\x99un! Half a crown!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPointing to this result as a large and satisfactory one, Mr Boffin\r\nsmeared it out with his moistened glove, and sat down on the remains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half a crown,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, meditating. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. (It ain\xe2\x80\x99t much, sir.) Half\r\na crown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Per week, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Per week. Yes. As to the amount of strain upon the intellect now. Was\r\nyou thinking at all of poetry?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg inquired, musing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it come dearer?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would come dearer,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg returned. \xe2\x80\x98For when a person comes to\r\ngrind off poetry night after night, it is but right he should expect to\r\nbe paid for its weakening effect on his mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To tell you the truth Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of poetry,\r\nexcept in so fur as this:--If you was to happen now and then to feel\r\nyourself in the mind to tip me and Mrs Boffin one of your ballads, why\r\nthen we should drop into poetry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I follow you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98But not being a regular musical\r\nprofessional, I should be loath to engage myself for that; and therefore\r\nwhen I dropped into poetry, I should ask to be considered so fur, in the\r\nlight of a friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this, Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled, and he shook Silas earnestly by the\r\nhand: protesting that it was more than he could have asked, and that he\r\ntook it very kindly indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of the terms, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin then demanded, with\r\nunconcealed anxiety.\r\n\r\nSilas, who had stimulated this anxiety by his hard reserve of manner,\r\nand who had begun to understand his man very well, replied with an air;\r\nas if he were saying something extraordinarily generous and great:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, I never bargain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I should have thought of you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, admiringly. \xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\r\nI never did \xe2\x80\x98aggle and I never will \xe2\x80\x98aggle. Consequently I meet you at\r\nonce, free and fair, with--Done, for double the money!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin seemed a little unprepared for this conclusion, but assented,\r\nwith the remark, \xe2\x80\x98You know better what it ought to be than I do, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand again shook hands with him upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could you begin to night, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 he then demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, careful to leave all the eagerness to him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see no difficulty if you wish it. You are provided with the needful\r\nimplement--a book, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bought him at a sale,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Eight wollumes. Red and gold.\r\nPurple ribbon in every wollume, to keep the place where you leave off.\r\nDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The book\xe2\x80\x99s name, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you might have know\xe2\x80\x99d him without it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin slightly disappointed. \xe2\x80\x98His name is\r\nDecline-And-Fall-Off-The-Rooshan-Empire.\xe2\x80\x99 (Mr Boffin went over these\r\nstones slowly and with much caution.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, nodding his head with an air of friendly\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know him, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been not to say right slap through him, very lately,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg\r\nmade answer, \xe2\x80\x98having been otherways employed, Mr Boffin. But know him?\r\nOld familiar declining and falling off the Rooshan? Rather, sir! Ever\r\nsince I was not so high as your stick. Ever since my eldest brother left\r\nour cottage to enlist into the army. On which occasion, as the ballad\r\nthat was made about it describes:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Beside that cottage door, Mr Boffin,\r\n             A girl was on her knees;\r\n     She held aloft a snowy scarf, Sir,\r\n             Which (my eldest brother noticed) fluttered in the breeze.\r\n     She breathed a prayer for him, Mr Boffin;\r\n             A prayer he coold not hear.\r\n     And my eldest brother lean\xe2\x80\x99d upon his sword, Mr Boffin,\r\n              And wiped away a tear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMuch impressed by this family circumstance, and also by the friendly\r\ndisposition of Mr Wegg, as exemplified in his so soon dropping into\r\npoetry, Mr Boffin again shook hands with that ligneous sharper, and\r\nbesought him to name his hour. Mr Wegg named eight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where I live,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98is called The Bower. Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower is\r\nthe name Mrs Boffin christened it when we come into it as a property.\r\nIf you should meet with anybody that don\xe2\x80\x99t know it by that name (which\r\nhardly anybody does), when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got nigh upon about a odd mile, or\r\nsay and a quarter if you like, up Maiden Lane, Battle Bridge, ask for\r\nHarmony Jail, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be put right. I shall expect you, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr Boffin, clapping him on the shoulder with the greatest enthusiasm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98most joyfully. I shall have no peace or patience till you come. Print\r\nis now opening ahead of me. This night, a literary man--WITH a wooden\r\nleg--\xe2\x80\x99 he bestowed an admiring look upon that decoration, as if it\r\ngreatly enhanced the relish of Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s attainments--\xe2\x80\x98will begin to\r\nlead me a new life! My fist again, Wegg. Morning, morning, morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLeft alone at his stall as the other ambled off, Mr Wegg subsided\r\ninto his screen, produced a small pocket-handkerchief of a\r\npenitentially-scrubbing character, and took himself by the nose with\r\na thoughtful aspect. Also, while he still grasped that feature, he\r\ndirected several thoughtful looks down the street, after the retiring\r\nfigure of Mr Boffin. But, profound gravity sat enthroned on Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance. For, while he considered within himself that this was\r\nan old fellow of rare simplicity, that this was an opportunity to\r\nbe improved, and that here might be money to be got beyond present\r\ncalculation, still he compromised himself by no admission that his new\r\nengagement was at all out of his way, or involved the least element of\r\nthe ridiculous. Mr Wegg would even have picked a handsome quarrel with\r\nany one who should have challenged his deep acquaintance with those\r\naforesaid eight volumes of Decline and Fall. His gravity was unusual,\r\nportentous, and immeasurable, not because he admitted any doubt of\r\nhimself but because he perceived it necessary to forestall any doubt of\r\nhimself in others. And herein he ranged with that very numerous class\r\nof impostors, who are quite as determined to keep up appearances to\r\nthemselves, as to their neighbours.\r\n\r\nA certain loftiness, likewise, took possession of Mr Wegg; a\r\ncondescending sense of being in request as an official expounder of\r\nmysteries. It did not move him to commercial greatness, but rather to\r\nlittleness, insomuch that if it had been within the possibilities of\r\nthings for the wooden measure to hold fewer nuts than usual, it would\r\nhave done so that day. But, when night came, and with her veiled eyes\r\nbeheld him stumping towards Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower, he was elated too.\r\n\r\nThe Bower was as difficult to find, as Fair Rosamond\xe2\x80\x99s without the clue.\r\nMr Wegg, having reached the quarter indicated, inquired for the Bower\r\nhalf a dozen times without the least success, until he remembered to\r\nask for Harmony Jail. This occasioned a quick change in the spirits of a\r\nhoarse gentleman and a donkey, whom he had much perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yer mean Old Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s, do yer?\xe2\x80\x99 said the hoarse gentleman, who was\r\ndriving his donkey in a truck, with a carrot for a whip. \xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t yer\r\nniver say so? Eddard and me is a goin\xe2\x80\x99 by HIM! Jump in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg complied, and the hoarse gentleman invited his attention to the\r\nthird person in company, thus;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you look at Eddard\xe2\x80\x99s ears. What was it as you named, agin?\r\nWhisper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg whispered, \xe2\x80\x98Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eddard! (keep yer hi on his ears) cut away to Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEdward, with his ears lying back, remained immoveable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eddard! (keep yer hi on his ears) cut away to Old Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 Edward\r\ninstantly pricked up his ears to their utmost, and rattled off at such\r\na pace that Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s conversation was jolted out of him in a most\r\ndislocated state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was-it-Ev-verajail?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Wegg, holding on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a proper jail, wot you and me would get committed to,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nhis escort; \xe2\x80\x98they giv\xe2\x80\x99 it the name, on accounts of Old Harmon living\r\nsolitary there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And-why-did-they-callitharm-Ony?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On accounts of his never agreeing with nobody. Like a speeches of\r\nchaff. Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s Jail; Harmony Jail. Working it round like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doyouknow-Mist-Erboff-in?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think so! Everybody do about here. Eddard knows him. (Keep yer\r\nhi on his ears.) Noddy Boffin, Eddard!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe effect of the name was so very alarming, in respect of causing a\r\ntemporary disappearance of Edward\xe2\x80\x99s head, casting his hind hoofs in the\r\nair, greatly accelerating the pace and increasing the jolting, that Mr\r\nWegg was fain to devote his attention exclusively to holding on, and to\r\nrelinquish his desire of ascertaining whether this homage to Boffin was\r\nto be considered complimentary or the reverse.\r\n\r\nPresently, Edward stopped at a gateway, and Wegg discreetly lost no time\r\nin slipping out at the back of the truck. The moment he was landed, his\r\nlate driver with a wave of the carrot, said \xe2\x80\x98Supper, Eddard!\xe2\x80\x99 and he,\r\nthe hind hoofs, the truck, and Edward, all seemed to fly into the air\r\ntogether, in a kind of apotheosis.\r\n\r\nPushing the gate, which stood ajar, Wegg looked into an enclosed space\r\nwhere certain tall dark mounds rose high against the sky, and where the\r\npathway to the Bower was indicated, as the moonlight showed, between two\r\nlines of broken crockery set in ashes. A white figure advancing along\r\nthis path, proved to be nothing more ghostly than Mr Boffin, easily\r\nattired for the pursuit of knowledge, in an undress garment of short\r\nwhite smock-frock. Having received his literary friend with great\r\ncordiality, he conducted him to the interior of the Bower and there\r\npresented him to Mrs Boffin:--a stout lady of a rubicund and cheerful\r\naspect, dressed (to Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s consternation) in a low evening-dress of\r\nsable satin, and a large black velvet hat and feathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Boffin, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98is a highflyer at Fashion. And her\r\nmake is such, that she does it credit. As to myself I ain\xe2\x80\x99t yet as\r\nFash\xe2\x80\x99nable as I may come to be. Henerietty, old lady, this is the\r\ngentleman that\xe2\x80\x99s a going to decline and fall off the Rooshan Empire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I am sure I hope it\xe2\x80\x99ll do you both good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\nIt was the queerest of rooms, fitted and furnished more like a luxurious\r\namateur tap-room than anything else within the ken of Silas Wegg. There\r\nwere two wooden settles by the fire, one on either side of it, with\r\na corresponding table before each. On one of these tables, the eight\r\nvolumes were ranged flat, in a row, like a galvanic battery; on the\r\nother, certain squat case-bottles of inviting appearance seemed to stand\r\non tiptoe to exchange glances with Mr Wegg over a front row of tumblers\r\nand a basin of white sugar. On the hob, a kettle steamed; on the hearth,\r\na cat reposed. Facing the fire between the settles, a sofa, a footstool,\r\nand a little table, formed a centrepiece devoted to Mrs Boffin.\r\nThey were garish in taste and colour, but were expensive articles of\r\ndrawing-room furniture that had a very odd look beside the settles\r\nand the flaring gaslight pendent from the ceiling. There was a flowery\r\ncarpet on the floor; but, instead of reaching to the fireside, its\r\nglowing vegetation stopped short at Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s footstool, and gave\r\nplace to a region of sand and sawdust. Mr Wegg also noticed, with\r\nadmiring eyes, that, while the flowery land displayed such hollow\r\nornamentation as stuffed birds and waxen fruits under glass-shades,\r\nthere were, in the territory where vegetation ceased, compensatory\r\nshelves on which the best part of a large pie and likewise of a cold\r\njoint were plainly discernible among other solids. The room itself was\r\nlarge, though low; and the heavy frames of its old-fashioned windows,\r\nand the heavy beams in its crooked ceiling, seemed to indicate that it\r\nhad once been a house of some mark standing alone in the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like it, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, in his pouncing manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I admire it greatly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Peculiar comfort at this\r\nfireside, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you understand it, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, in a general way, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg was beginning slowly and\r\nknowingly, with his head stuck on one side, as evasive people do begin,\r\nwhen the other cut him short:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You DON\xe2\x80\x99T understand it, Wegg, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain it. These arrangements\r\nis made by mutual consent between Mrs Boffin and me. Mrs Boffin, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nmentioned, is a highflyer at Fashion; at present I\xe2\x80\x99m not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nhigher than comfort, and comfort of the sort that I\xe2\x80\x99m equal to the\r\nenjoyment of. Well then. Where would be the good of Mrs Boffin and me\r\nquarrelling over it? We never did quarrel, before we come into Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nBower as a property; why quarrel when we HAVE come into Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower\r\nas a property? So Mrs Boffin, she keeps up her part of the room, in her\r\nway; I keep up my part of the room in mine. In consequence of which\r\nwe have at once, Sociability (I should go melancholy mad without Mrs\r\nBoffin), Fashion, and Comfort. If I get by degrees to be a higher-flyer\r\nat Fashion, then Mrs Boffin will by degrees come for\xe2\x80\x99arder. If Mrs\r\nBoffin should ever be less of a dab at Fashion than she is at the\r\npresent time, then Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s carpet would go back\xe2\x80\x99arder. If we should\r\nboth continny as we are, why then HERE we are, and give us a kiss, old\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin who, perpetually smiling, had approached and drawn her plump\r\narm through her lord\xe2\x80\x99s, most willingly complied. Fashion, in the form\r\nof her black velvet hat and feathers, tried to prevent it; but got\r\ndeservedly crushed in the endeavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So now, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, wiping his mouth with an air of much\r\nrefreshment, \xe2\x80\x98you begin to know us as we are. This is a charming spot,\r\nis the Bower, but you must get to apprechiate it by degrees. It\xe2\x80\x99s a spot\r\nto find out the merits of; little by little, and a new\xe2\x80\x99un every day.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a serpentining walk up each of the mounds, that gives you the\r\nyard and neighbourhood changing every moment. When you get to the top,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a view of the neighbouring premises, not to be surpassed. The\r\npremises of Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s late father (Canine Provision Trade), you look\r\ndown into, as if they was your own. And the top of the High Mound is\r\ncrowned with a lattice-work Arbour, in which, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t read out loud\r\nmany a book in the summer, ay, and as a friend, drop many a time into\r\npoetry too, it shan\xe2\x80\x99t be my fault. Now, what\xe2\x80\x99ll you read on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, as if there were nothing new in his\r\nreading at all. \xe2\x80\x98I generally do it on gin and water.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keeps the organ moist, does it, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, with innocent\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N-no, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wegg, coolly, \xe2\x80\x98I should hardly describe it so, sir.\r\nI should say, mellers it. Mellers it, is the word I should employ, Mr\r\nBoffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis wooden conceit and craft kept exact pace with the delighted\r\nexpectation of his victim. The visions rising before his mercenary mind,\r\nof the many ways in which this connexion was to be turned to account,\r\nnever obscured the foremost idea natural to a dull overreaching man,\r\nthat he must not make himself too cheap.\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Fashion, as a less inexorable deity than the idol usually\r\nworshipped under that name, did not forbid her mixing for her literary\r\nguest, or asking if he found the result to his liking. On his returning\r\na gracious answer and taking his place at the literary settle, Mr Boffin\r\nbegan to compose himself as a listener, at the opposite settle, with\r\nexultant eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry to deprive you of a pipe, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, filling his own, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t do both together. Oh! and another thing I forgot to name! When\r\nyou come in here of an evening, and look round you, and notice anything\r\non a shelf that happens to catch your fancy, mention it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg, who had been going to put on his spectacles, immediately laid them\r\ndown, with the sprightly observation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You read my thoughts, sir. DO my eyes deceive me, or is that object up\r\nthere a--a pie? It can\xe2\x80\x99t be a pie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pie, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Boffin, with a glance of some little\r\ndiscomfiture at the Decline and Fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98HAVE I lost my smell for fruits, or is it a apple pie, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked\r\nWegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a veal and ham pie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it indeed, sir? And it would be hard, sir, to name the pie that is\r\na better pie than a weal and hammer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, nodding his head\r\nemotionally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have some, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Mr Boffin, I think I will, at your invitation. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nat any other party\xe2\x80\x99s, at the present juncture; but at yours, sir!--And\r\nmeaty jelly too, especially when a little salt, which is the case where\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s ham, is mellering to the organ, is very mellering to the organ.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Wegg did not say what organ, but spoke with a cheerful generality.\r\n\r\nSo, the pie was brought down, and the worthy Mr Boffin exercised his\r\npatience until Wegg, in the exercise of his knife and fork, had finished\r\nthe dish: only profiting by the opportunity to inform Wegg that although\r\nit was not strictly Fashionable to keep the contents of a larder thus\r\nexposed to view, he (Mr Boffin) considered it hospitable; for the\r\nreason, that instead of saying, in a comparatively unmeaning manner, to\r\na visitor, \xe2\x80\x98There are such and such edibles down stairs; will you have\r\nanything up?\xe2\x80\x99 you took the bold practical course of saying, \xe2\x80\x98Cast your\r\neye along the shelves, and, if you see anything you like there, have it\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr Wegg at length pushed away his plate and put on his\r\nspectacles, and Mr Boffin lighted his pipe and looked with beaming\r\neyes into the opening world before him, and Mrs Boffin reclined in a\r\nfashionable manner on her sofa: as one who would be part of the audience\r\nif she found she could, and would go to sleep if she found she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!\xe2\x80\x99 began Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98This, Mr Boffin and Lady, is the first chapter of\r\nthe first wollume of the Decline and Fall off--\xe2\x80\x99 here he looked hard at\r\nthe book, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, it comes into my mind, do you know, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg with an air\r\nof insinuating frankness (having first again looked hard at the book),\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that you made a little mistake this morning, which I had meant to set\r\nyou right in, only something put it out of my head. I think you said\r\nRooshan Empire, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is Rooshan; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir. Roman. Roman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The difference, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg was faltering and in danger of breaking\r\ndown, when a bright thought flashed upon him. \xe2\x80\x98The difference, sir?\r\nThere you place me in a difficulty, Mr Boffin. Suffice it to observe,\r\nthat the difference is best postponed to some other occasion when Mrs\r\nBoffin does not honour us with her company. In Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nsir, we had better drop it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg thus came out of his disadvantage with quite a chivalrous air,\r\nand not only that, but by dint of repeating with a manly delicacy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s presence, sir, we had better drop it!\xe2\x80\x99 turned the\r\ndisadvantage on Boffin, who felt that he had committed himself in a very\r\npainful manner.\r\n\r\nThen, Mr Wegg, in a dry unflinching way, entered on his task; going\r\nstraight across country at everything that came before him; taking all\r\nthe hard words, biographical and geographical; getting rather shaken by\r\nHadrian, Trajan, and the Antonines; stumbling at Polybius (pronounced\r\nPolly Beeious, and supposed by Mr Boffin to be a Roman virgin, and by\r\nMrs Boffin to be responsible for that necessity of dropping it); heavily\r\nunseated by Titus Antoninus Pius; up again and galloping smoothly with\r\nAugustus; finally, getting over the ground well with Commodus: who,\r\nunder the appellation of Commodious, was held by Mr Boffin to have been\r\nquite unworthy of his English origin, and \xe2\x80\x98not to have acted up to his\r\nname\xe2\x80\x99 in his government of the Roman people. With the death of this\r\npersonage, Mr Wegg terminated his first reading; long before which\r\nconsummation several total eclipses of Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s candle behind\r\nher black velvet disc, would have been very alarming, but for being\r\nregularly accompanied by a potent smell of burnt pens when her feathers\r\ntook fire, which acted as a restorative and woke her. Mr Wegg, having\r\nread on by rote and attached as few ideas as possible to the text, came\r\nout of the encounter fresh; but, Mr Boffin, who had soon laid down his\r\nunfinished pipe, and had ever since sat intently staring with his eyes\r\nand mind at the confounding enormities of the Romans, was so severely\r\npunished that he could hardly wish his literary friend Good-night, and\r\narticulate \xe2\x80\x98Tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Commodious,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Mr Boffin, staring at the moon, after letting\r\nWegg out at the gate and fastening it: \xe2\x80\x98Commodious fights in that\r\nwild-beast-show, seven hundred and thirty-five times, in one character\r\nonly! As if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stunning enough, a hundred lions is turned into\r\nthe same wild-beast-show all at once! As if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stunning enough,\r\nCommodious, in another character, kills \xe2\x80\x98em all off in a hundred goes!\r\nAs if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stunning enough, Vittle-us (and well named too) eats\r\nsix millions\xe2\x80\x99 worth, English money, in seven months! Wegg takes it easy,\r\nbut upon-my-soul to a old bird like myself these are scarers. And even\r\nnow that Commodious is strangled, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a way to our bettering\r\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin added as he turned his pensive steps towards the\r\nBower and shook his head, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this morning there was half so\r\nmany Scarers in Print. But I\xe2\x80\x99m in for it now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nCUT ADRIFT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, already mentioned as a tavern of\r\na dropsical appearance, had long settled down into a state of hale\r\ninfirmity. In its whole constitution it had not a straight floor, and\r\nhardly a straight line; but it had outlasted, and clearly would yet\r\noutlast, many a better-trimmed building, many a sprucer public-house.\r\nExternally, it was a narrow lopsided wooden jumble of corpulent windows\r\nheaped one upon another as you might heap as many toppling oranges,\r\nwith a crazy wooden verandah impending over the water; indeed the whole\r\nhouse, inclusive of the complaining flag-staff on the roof, impended\r\nover the water, but seemed to have got into the condition of a\r\nfaint-hearted diver who has paused so long on the brink that he will\r\nnever go in at all.\r\n\r\nThis description applies to the river-frontage of the Six Jolly\r\nFellowship Porters. The back of the establishment, though the chief\r\nentrance was there, so contracted that it merely represented in its\r\nconnexion with the front, the handle of a flat iron set upright on its\r\nbroadest end. This handle stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court\r\nand alley: which wilderness pressed so hard and close upon the Six Jolly\r\nFellowship Porters as to leave the hostelry not an inch of ground beyond\r\nits door. For this reason, in combination with the fact that the house\r\nwas all but afloat at high water, when the Porters had a family wash the\r\nlinen subjected to that operation might usually be seen drying on lines\r\nstretched across the reception-rooms and bed-chambers.\r\n\r\nThe wood forming the chimney-pieces, beams, partitions, floors and\r\ndoors, of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, seemed in its old age\r\nfraught with confused memories of its youth. In many places it had\r\nbecome gnarled and riven, according to the manner of old trees; knots\r\nstarted out of it; and here and there it seemed to twist itself into\r\nsome likeness of boughs. In this state of second childhood, it had an\r\nair of being in its own way garrulous about its early life. Not without\r\nreason was it often asserted by the regular frequenters of the Porters,\r\nthat when the light shone full upon the grain of certain panels, and\r\nparticularly upon an old corner cupboard of walnut-wood in the bar, you\r\nmight trace little forests there, and tiny trees like the parent tree,\r\nin full umbrageous leaf.\r\n\r\nThe bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters was a bar to soften the\r\nhuman breast. The available space in it was not much larger than a\r\nhackney-coach; but no one could have wished the bar bigger, that space\r\nwas so girt in by corpulent little casks, and by cordial-bottles\r\nradiant with fictitious grapes in bunches, and by lemons in nets, and\r\nby biscuits in baskets, and by the polite beer-pulls that made low\r\nbows when customers were served with beer, and by the cheese in a snug\r\ncorner, and by the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s own small table in a snugger corner near\r\nthe fire, with the cloth everlastingly laid. This haven was divided from\r\nthe rough world by a glass partition and a half-door, with a leaden\r\nsill upon it for the convenience of resting your liquor; but, over this\r\nhalf-door the bar\xe2\x80\x99s snugness so gushed forth that, albeit customers\r\ndrank there standing, in a dark and draughty passage where they were\r\nshouldered by other customers passing in and out, they always appeared\r\nto drink under an enchanting delusion that they were in the bar itself.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, both the tap and parlour of the Six Jolly Fellowship\r\nPorters gave upon the river, and had red curtains matching the noses of\r\nthe regular customers, and were provided with comfortable fireside tin\r\nutensils, like models of sugar-loaf hats, made in that shape that they\r\nmight, with their pointed ends, seek out for themselves glowing nooks\r\nin the depths of the red coals, when they mulled your ale, or heated for\r\nyou those delectable drinks, Purl, Flip, and Dog\xe2\x80\x99s Nose. The first of\r\nthese humming compounds was a speciality of the Porters, which, through\r\nan inscription on its door-posts, gently appealed to your feelings as,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Early Purl House\xe2\x80\x99. For, it would seem that Purl must always be\r\ntaken early; though whether for any more distinctly stomachic reason\r\nthan that, as the early bird catches the worm, so the early purl catches\r\nthe customer, cannot here be resolved. It only remains to add that in\r\nthe handle of the flat iron, and opposite the bar, was a very little\r\nroom like a three-cornered hat, into which no direct ray of sun, moon,\r\nor star, ever penetrated, but which was superstitiously regarded as a\r\nsanctuary replete with comfort and retirement by gaslight, and on the\r\ndoor of which was therefore painted its alluring name: Cosy.\r\n\r\nMiss Potterson, sole proprietor and manager of the Fellowship Porters,\r\nreigned supreme on her throne, the Bar, and a man must have drunk\r\nhimself mad drunk indeed if he thought he could contest a point with\r\nher. Being known on her own authority as Miss Abbey Potterson, some\r\nwater-side heads, which (like the water) were none of the clearest,\r\nharboured muddled notions that, because of her dignity and firmness, she\r\nwas named after, or in some sort related to, the Abbey at Westminster.\r\nBut, Abbey was only short for Abigail, by which name Miss Potterson had\r\nbeen christened at Limehouse Church, some sixty and odd years before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you mind, you Riderhood,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey Potterson, with emphatic\r\nforefinger over the half-door, \xe2\x80\x98the Fellowship don\xe2\x80\x99t want you at all,\r\nand would rather by far have your room than your company; but if you\r\nwere as welcome here as you are not, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even then have\r\nanother drop of drink here this night, after this present pint of beer.\r\nSo make the most of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you know, Miss Potterson,\xe2\x80\x99 this was suggested very meekly though,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if I behave myself, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help serving me, miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98CAN\xe2\x80\x99T I!\xe2\x80\x99 said Abbey, with infinite expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Miss Potterson; because, you see, the law--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the law here, my man,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\nconvince you of that, if you doubt it at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never said I did doubt it at all, Miss Abbey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the better for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAbbey the supreme threw the customer\xe2\x80\x99s halfpence into the till, and,\r\nseating herself in her fireside-chair, resumed the newspaper she had\r\nbeen reading. She was a tall, upright, well-favoured woman, though\r\nsevere of countenance, and had more of the air of a schoolmistress than\r\nmistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters. The man on the other side\r\nof the half-door, was a waterside-man with a squinting leer, and he eyed\r\nher as if he were one of her pupils in disgrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re cruel hard upon me, Miss Potterson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Potterson read her newspaper with contracted brows, and took no\r\nnotice until he whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Potterson! Ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Might I have half a word with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDeigning then to turn her eyes sideways towards the suppliant, Miss\r\nPotterson beheld him knuckling his low forehead, and ducking at her with\r\nhis head, as if he were asking leave to fling himself head foremost over\r\nthe half-door and alight on his feet in the bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Potterson, with a manner as short as she herself was\r\nlong, \xe2\x80\x98say your half word. Bring it out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Potterson! Ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Would you \xe2\x80\x98sxcuse me taking the liberty of\r\nasking, is it my character that you take objections to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Potterson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it that you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not afraid OF YOU,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Miss Potterson, \xe2\x80\x98if you mean that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I humbly don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, Miss Abbey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You really are so cruel hard upon me! What I was going to make\r\ninquiries was no more than, might you have any apprehensions--leastways\r\nbeliefs or suppositions--that the company\xe2\x80\x99s property mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\naltogether to be considered safe, if I used the house too regular?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want to know for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Miss Abbey, respectfully meaning no offence to you, it would\r\nbe some satisfaction to a man\xe2\x80\x99s mind, to understand why the Fellowship\r\nPorters is not to be free to such as me, and is to be free to such as\r\nGaffer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe face of the hostess darkened with some shadow of perplexity, as she\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x98Gaffer has never been where you have been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Signifying in Quod, Miss? Perhaps not. But he may have merited it. He\r\nmay be suspected of far worse than ever I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who suspects him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many, perhaps. One, beyond all doubts. I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU are not much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey Potterson, knitting her brows again\r\nwith disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I was his pardner. Mind you, Miss Abbey, I was his pardner. As\r\nsuch I know more of the ins and outs of him than any person living does.\r\nNotice this! I am the man that was his pardner, and I am the man that\r\nsuspects him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Miss Abbey, though with a deeper shade of perplexity\r\nthan before, \xe2\x80\x98you criminate yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Miss Abbey. For how does it stand? It stands this way. When\r\nI was his pardner, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t never give him satisfaction. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI never give him satisfaction? Because my luck was bad; because I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find many enough of \xe2\x80\x98em. How was his luck? Always good. Notice\r\nthis! Always good! Ah! There\xe2\x80\x99s a many games, Miss Abbey, in which\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s chance, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a many others in which there\xe2\x80\x99s skill too,\r\nmixed along with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That Gaffer has a skill in finding what he finds, who doubts, man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked Miss Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A skill in purwiding what he finds, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, shaking\r\nhis evil head.\r\n\r\nMiss Abbey knitted her brow at him, as he darkly leered at her. \xe2\x80\x98If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re out upon the river pretty nigh every tide, and if you want to\r\nfind a man or woman in the river, you\xe2\x80\x99ll greatly help your luck, Miss\r\nAbbey, by knocking a man or woman on the head aforehand and pitching \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious Lud!\xe2\x80\x99 was the involuntary exclamation of Miss Potterson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mind you!\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, stretching forward over the half door\r\nto throw his words into the bar; for his voice was as if the head of his\r\nboat\xe2\x80\x99s mop were down his throat; \xe2\x80\x98I say so, Miss Abbey! And mind you!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll follow him up, Miss Abbey! And mind you! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him to hook at\r\nlast, if it\xe2\x80\x99s twenty year hence, I will! Who\xe2\x80\x99s he, to be favoured along\r\nof his daughter? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I got a daughter of my own!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that flourish, and seeming to have talked himself rather more drunk\r\nand much more ferocious than he had begun by being, Mr Riderhood took up\r\nhis pint pot and swaggered off to the taproom.\r\n\r\nGaffer was not there, but a pretty strong muster of Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s pupils\r\nwere, who exhibited, when occasion required, the greatest docility. On\r\nthe clock\xe2\x80\x99s striking ten, and Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s appearing at the door, and\r\naddressing a certain person in a faded scarlet jacket, with \xe2\x80\x98George\r\nJones, your time\xe2\x80\x99s up! I told your wife you should be punctual,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nJones submissively rose, gave the company good-night, and retired. At\r\nhalf-past ten, on Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s looking in again, and saying, \xe2\x80\x98William\r\nWilliams, Bob Glamour, and Jonathan, you are all due,\xe2\x80\x99 Williams, Bob,\r\nand Jonathan with similar meekness took their leave and evaporated.\r\nGreater wonder than these, when a bottle-nosed person in a glazed hat\r\nhad after some considerable hesitation ordered another glass of gin and\r\nwater of the attendant potboy, and when Miss Abbey, instead of sending\r\nit, appeared in person, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Captain Joey, you have had as much as\r\nwill do you good,\xe2\x80\x99 not only did the captain feebly rub his knees and\r\ncontemplate the fire without offering a word of protest, but the rest\r\nof the company murmured, \xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, Captain! Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s right; you\r\nbe guided by Miss Abbey, Captain.\xe2\x80\x99 Nor, was Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance in\r\nanywise abated by this submission, but rather sharpened; for, looking\r\nround on the deferential faces of her school, and descrying two other\r\nyoung persons in need of admonition, she thus bestowed it: \xe2\x80\x98Tom Tootle,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s time for a young fellow who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be married next month, to\r\nbe at home and asleep. And you needn\xe2\x80\x99t nudge him, Mr Jack Mullins, for\r\nI know your work begins early tomorrow, and I say the same to you.\r\nSo come! Good-night, like good lads!\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which, the blushing Tootle\r\nlooked to Mullins, and the blushing Mullins looked to Tootle, on the\r\nquestion who should rise first, and finally both rose together and went\r\nout on the broad grin, followed by Miss Abbey; in whose presence the\r\ncompany did not take the liberty of grinning likewise.\r\n\r\nIn such an establishment, the white-aproned pot-boy with his\r\nshirt-sleeves arranged in a tight roll on each bare shoulder, was a mere\r\nhint of the possibility of physical force, thrown out as a matter of\r\nstate and form. Exactly at the closing hour, all the guests who were\r\nleft, filed out in the best order: Miss Abbey standing at the half door\r\nof the bar, to hold a ceremony of review and dismissal. All wished\r\nMiss Abbey good-night and Miss Abbey wished good-night to all, except\r\nRiderhood. The sapient pot-boy, looking on officially, then had the\r\nconviction borne in upon his soul, that the man was evermore outcast and\r\nexcommunicate from the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You Bob Gliddery,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey to this pot-boy, \xe2\x80\x98run round to\r\nHexam\xe2\x80\x99s and tell his daughter Lizzie that I want to speak to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith exemplary swiftness Bob Gliddery departed, and returned. Lizzie,\r\nfollowing him, arrived as one of the two female domestics of the\r\nFellowship Porters arranged on the snug little table by the bar fire,\r\nMiss Potterson\xe2\x80\x99s supper of hot sausages and mashed potatoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in and sit ye down, girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey. \xe2\x80\x98Can you eat a bit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No thank you, Miss. I have had my supper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had mine too, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, pushing away the\r\nuntasted dish, \xe2\x80\x98and more than enough of it. I am put out, Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry for it, Miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why, in the name of Goodness,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Miss Abbey, sharply, \xe2\x80\x98do you\r\ndo it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do it, Miss!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look astonished. I ought to have begun with a word\r\nof explanation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my way to make short cuts at things. I always\r\nwas a pepperer. You Bob Gliddery there, put the chain upon the door and\r\nget ye down to your supper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith an alacrity that seemed no less referable to the pepperer fact\r\nthan to the supper fact, Bob obeyed, and his boots were heard descending\r\ntowards the bed of the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie Hexam, Lizzie Hexam,\xe2\x80\x99 then began Miss Potterson, \xe2\x80\x98how often have\r\nI held out to you the opportunity of getting clear of your father, and\r\ndoing well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very often, Miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very often? Yes! And I might as well have spoken to the iron funnel of\r\nthe strongest sea-going steamer that passes the Fellowship Porters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Miss,\xe2\x80\x99 Lizzie pleaded; \xe2\x80\x98because that would not be thankful, and I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I vow and declare I am half ashamed of myself for taking such an\r\ninterest in you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, pettishly, \xe2\x80\x98for I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\r\nshould do it if you were not good-looking. Why ain\xe2\x80\x99t you ugly?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie merely answered this difficult question with an apologetic\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Miss Potterson, \xe2\x80\x98so it\xe2\x80\x99s no use going into\r\nthat. I must take you as I find you. Which indeed is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done. And\r\nyou mean to say you are still obstinate?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not obstinate, Miss, I hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Firm (I suppose you call it) then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Miss. Fixed like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was an obstinate person yet, who would own to the word!\xe2\x80\x99 remarked\r\nMiss Potterson, rubbing her vexed nose; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I would, if I was\r\nobstinate; but I am a pepperer, which is different. Lizzie Hexam, Lizzie\r\nHexam, think again. Do you know the worst of your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I know the worst of father!\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, opening her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know the suspicions to which your father makes himself liable?\r\nDo you know the suspicions that are actually about, against him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of what he habitually did, oppressed the girl heavily,\r\nand she slowly cast down her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say, Lizzie. Do you know?\xe2\x80\x99 urged Miss Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please to tell me what the suspicions are, Miss,\xe2\x80\x99 she asked after a\r\nsilence, with her eyes upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not an easy thing to tell a daughter, but it must be told. It is\r\nthought by some, then, that your father helps to their death a few of\r\nthose that he finds dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe relief of hearing what she felt sure was a false suspicion, in place\r\nof the expected real and true one, so lightened Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s breast for the\r\nmoment, that Miss Abbey was amazed at her demeanour. She raised her eyes\r\nquickly, shook her head, and, in a kind of triumph, almost laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They little know father who talk like that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98She takes it,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98very quietly. She takes it with\r\nextraordinary quietness!\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, as a recollection flashed upon her, \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nsome one who has a grudge against father; some one who has threatened\r\nfather! Is it Riderhood, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; yes it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes! He was father\xe2\x80\x99s partner, and father broke with him, and now he\r\nrevenges himself. Father broke with him when I was by, and he was very\r\nangry at it. And besides, Miss Abbey!--Will you never, without strong\r\nreason, let pass your lips what I am going to say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe bent forward to say it in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was on the night when the Harmon murder was found out, through\r\nfather, just above bridge. And just below bridge, as we were sculling\r\nhome, Riderhood crept out of the dark in his boat. And many and many\r\ntimes afterwards, when such great pains were taken to come to the bottom\r\nof the crime, and it never could be come near, I thought in my own\r\nthoughts, could Riderhood himself have done the murder, and did he\r\npurposely let father find the body? It seemed a\xe2\x80\x99most wicked and cruel\r\nto so much as think such a thing; but now that he tries to throw it upon\r\nfather, I go back to it as if it was a truth. Can it be a truth? That\r\nwas put into my mind by the dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe asked this question, rather of the fire than of the hostess of the\r\nFellowship Porters, and looked round the little bar with troubled eyes.\r\n\r\nBut, Miss Potterson, as a ready schoolmistress accustomed to bring her\r\npupils to book, set the matter in a light that was essentially of this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You poor deluded girl,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that you can\xe2\x80\x99t open\r\nyour mind to particular suspicions of one of the two, without opening\r\nyour mind to general suspicions of the other? They had worked together.\r\nTheir goings-on had been going on for some time. Even granting that it\r\nwas as you have had in your thoughts, what the two had done together\r\nwould come familiar to the mind of one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know father, Miss, when you talk like that. Indeed, indeed,\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Potterson. \xe2\x80\x98Leave him. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t break\r\nwith him altogether, but leave him. Do well away from him; not because\r\nof what I have told you to-night--we\xe2\x80\x99ll pass no judgment upon that,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ll hope it may not be--but because of what I have urged on you\r\nbefore. No matter whether it\xe2\x80\x99s owing to your good looks or not, I like\r\nyou and I want to serve you. Lizzie, come under my direction. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfling yourself away, my girl, but be persuaded into being respectable\r\nand happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the sound good feeling and good sense of her entreaty, Miss Abbey\r\nhad softened into a soothing tone, and had even drawn her arm round the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s waist. But, she only replied, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, thank you! I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t. I must not think of it. The harder father is borne upon, the more\r\nhe needs me to lean on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd then Miss Abbey, who, like all hard people when they do soften,\r\nfelt that there was considerable compensation owing to her, underwent\r\nreaction and became frigid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have done what I can,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and you must go your way. You make\r\nyour bed, and you must lie on it. But tell your father one thing: he\r\nmust not come here any more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Miss, will you forbid him the house where I know he\xe2\x80\x99s safe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Fellowships,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98has itself to look to, as well\r\nas others. It has been hard work to establish order here, and make the\r\nFellowships what it is, and it is daily and nightly hard work to keep it\r\nso. The Fellowships must not have a taint upon it that may give it a bad\r\nname. I forbid the house to Riderhood, and I forbid the house to Gaffer.\r\nI forbid both, equally. I find from Riderhood and you together, that\r\nthere are suspicions against both men, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take upon\r\nmyself to decide betwixt them. They are both tarred with a dirty brush,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t have the Fellowships tarred with the same brush. That\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nI know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, Miss!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie Hexam, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah!--Good-night!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Abbey with a shake of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Believe me, Miss Abbey, I am truly grateful all the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can believe a good deal,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the stately Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98so I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to\r\nbelieve that too, Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo supper did Miss Potterson take that night, and only half her usual\r\ntumbler of hot Port Negus. And the female domestics--two robust sisters,\r\nwith staring black eyes, shining flat red faces, blunt noses, and strong\r\nblack curls, like dolls--interchanged the sentiment that Missis had had\r\nher hair combed the wrong way by somebody. And the pot-boy afterwards\r\nremarked, that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been \xe2\x80\x98so rattled to bed\xe2\x80\x99, since his late mother\r\nhad systematically accelerated his retirement to rest with a poker.\r\n\r\nThe chaining of the door behind her, as she went forth, disenchanted\r\nLizzie Hexam of that first relief she had felt. The night was black and\r\nshrill, the river-side wilderness was melancholy, and there was a sound\r\nof casting-out, in the rattling of the iron-links, and the grating of\r\nthe bolts and staples under Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s hand. As she came beneath\r\nthe lowering sky, a sense of being involved in a murky shade of Murder\r\ndropped upon her; and, as the tidal swell of the river broke at her feet\r\nwithout her seeing how it gathered, so, her thoughts startled her by\r\nrushing out of an unseen void and striking at her heart.\r\n\r\nOf her father\xe2\x80\x99s being groundlessly suspected, she felt sure. Sure. Sure.\r\nAnd yet, repeat the word inwardly as often as she would, the attempt to\r\nreason out and prove that she was sure, always came after it and failed.\r\nRiderhood had done the deed, and entrapped her father. Riderhood had\r\nnot done the deed, but had resolved in his malice to turn against her\r\nfather, the appearances that were ready to his hand to distort. Equally\r\nand swiftly upon either putting of the case, followed the frightful\r\npossibility that her father, being innocent, yet might come to be\r\nbelieved guilty. She had heard of people suffering Death for bloodshed\r\nof which they were afterwards proved pure, and those ill-fated persons\r\nwere not, first, in that dangerous wrong in which her father stood. Then\r\nat the best, the beginning of his being set apart, whispered against,\r\nand avoided, was a certain fact. It dated from that very night. And as\r\nthe great black river with its dreary shores was soon lost to her view\r\nin the gloom, so, she stood on the river\xe2\x80\x99s brink unable to see into the\r\nvast blank misery of a life suspected, and fallen away from by good and\r\nbad, but knowing that it lay there dim before her, stretching away to\r\nthe great ocean, Death.\r\n\r\nOne thing only, was clear to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Accustomed from her very\r\nbabyhood promptly to do the thing that could be done--whether to keep\r\nout weather, to ward off cold, to postpone hunger, or what not--she\r\nstarted out of her meditation, and ran home.\r\n\r\nThe room was quiet, and the lamp burnt on the table. In the bunk in the\r\ncorner, her brother lay asleep. She bent over him softly, kissed him,\r\nand came to the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the time of Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s closing, and by the run of the tide, it\r\nmust be one. Tide\xe2\x80\x99s running up. Father at Chiswick, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\ncoming down, till after the turn, and that\xe2\x80\x99s at half after four. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall Charley at six. I shall hear the church-clocks strike, as I sit\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery quietly, she placed a chair before the scanty fire, and sat down in\r\nit, drawing her shawl about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley\xe2\x80\x99s hollow down by the flare is not there now. Poor Charley!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe clock struck two, and the clock struck three, and the clock struck\r\nfour, and she remained there, with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s patience and her own\r\npurpose. When the morning was well on between four and five, she slipped\r\noff her shoes (that her going about might not wake Charley), trimmed\r\nthe fire sparingly, put water on to boil, and set the table for\r\nbreakfast. Then she went up the ladder, lamp in hand, and came down\r\nagain, and glided about and about, making a little bundle. Lastly, from\r\nher pocket, and from the chimney-piece, and from an inverted basin\r\non the highest shelf she brought halfpence, a few sixpences, fewer\r\nshillings, and fell to laboriously and noiselessly counting them, and\r\nsetting aside one little heap. She was still so engaged, when she was\r\nstartled by:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hal-loa!\xe2\x80\x99 From her brother, sitting up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You made me jump, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jump! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you make ME jump, when I opened my eyes a moment ago, and\r\nsaw you sitting there, like the ghost of a girl miser, in the dead of\r\nthe night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not the dead of the night, Charley. It\xe2\x80\x99s nigh six in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it though? But what are you up to, Liz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still telling your fortune, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to be a precious small one, if that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nare you putting that little pile of money by itself for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For you, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get out of bed, Charley, and get washed and dressed, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer composed manner, and her low distinct voice, always had an influence\r\nover him. His head was soon in a basin of water, and out of it again,\r\nand staring at her through a storm of towelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never,\xe2\x80\x99 towelling at himself as if he were his bitterest enemy, \xe2\x80\x98saw\r\nsuch a girl as you are. What IS the move, Liz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you almost ready for breakfast, Charley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can pour it out. Hal-loa! I say? And a bundle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a bundle, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s for me, too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Charley; I do; indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMore serious of face, and more slow of action, than he had been, the\r\nboy completed his dressing, and came and sat down at the little\r\nbreakfast-table, with his eyes amazedly directed to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Charley dear, I have made up my mind that this is the right\r\ntime for your going away from us. Over and above all the blessed change\r\nof by-and-bye, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be much happier, and do much better, even so soon\r\nas next month. Even so soon as next week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you know I shall?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite know how, Charley, but I do.\xe2\x80\x99 In spite of her unchanged\r\nmanner of speaking, and her unchanged appearance of composure, she\r\nscarcely trusted herself to look at him, but kept her eyes employed on\r\nthe cutting and buttering of his bread, and on the mixing of his tea,\r\nand other such little preparations. \xe2\x80\x98You must leave father to me,\r\nCharley--I will do what I can with him--but you must go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t stand upon ceremony, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled the boy, throwing his\r\nbread and butter about, in an ill-humour.\r\n\r\nShe made him no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, then, bursting out into an angry\r\nwhimpering, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a selfish jade, and you think there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for\r\nthree of us, and you want to get rid of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you believe so, Charley,--yes, then I believe too, that I am a\r\nselfish jade, and that I think there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for three of us, and\r\nthat I want to get rid of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was only when the boy rushed at her, and threw his arms round her\r\nneck, that she lost her self-restraint. But she lost it then, and wept\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry! I am satisfied to go, Liz; I am satisfied to go.\r\nI know you send me away for my good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Charley, Charley, Heaven above us knows I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes yes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind what I said. Don\xe2\x80\x99t remember it. Kiss me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a silence, she loosed him, to dry her eyes and regain her strong\r\nquiet influence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now listen, Charley dear. We both know it must be done, and I alone\r\nknow there is good reason for its being done at once. Go straight to the\r\nschool, and say that you and I agreed upon it--that we can\xe2\x80\x99t overcome\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s opposition--that father will never trouble them, but will never\r\ntake you back. You are a credit to the school, and you will be a greater\r\ncredit to it yet, and they will help you to get a living. Show what\r\nclothes you have brought, and what money, and say that I will send some\r\nmore money. If I can get some in no other way, I will ask a little help\r\nof those two gentlemen who came here that night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!\xe2\x80\x99 cried her brother, quickly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have it of that chap\r\nthat took hold of me by the chin! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have it of that Wrayburn\r\none!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps a slight additional tinge of red flushed up into her face and\r\nbrow, as with a nod she laid a hand upon his lips to keep him silently\r\nattentive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And above all things mind this, Charley! Be sure you always speak well\r\nof father. Be sure you always give father his full due. You can\xe2\x80\x99t deny\r\nthat because father has no learning himself he is set against it in\r\nyou; but favour nothing else against him, and be sure you say--as you\r\nknow--that your sister is devoted to him. And if you should ever happen\r\nto hear anything said against father that is new to you, it will not be\r\ntrue. Remember, Charley! It will not be true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy looked at her with some doubt and surprise, but she went on\r\nagain without heeding it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Above all things remember! It will not be true. I have nothing more to\r\nsay, Charley dear, except, be good, and get learning, and only think of\r\nsome things in the old life here, as if you had dreamed them in a dream\r\nlast night. Good-bye, my Darling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThough so young, she infused in these parting words a love that was far\r\nmore like a mother\xe2\x80\x99s than a sister\xe2\x80\x99s, and before which the boy was quite\r\nbowed down. After holding her to his breast with a passionate cry, he\r\ntook up his bundle and darted out at the door, with an arm across his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe white face of the winter day came sluggishly on, veiled in a\r\nfrosty mist; and the shadowy ships in the river slowly changed to black\r\nsubstances; and the sun, blood-red on the eastern marshes behind dark\r\nmasts and yards, seemed filled with the ruins of a forest it had set on\r\nfire. Lizzie, looking for her father, saw him coming, and stood upon the\r\ncauseway that he might see her.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing with him but his boat, and came on apace. A knot of those\r\namphibious human-creatures who appear to have some mysterious power\r\nof extracting a subsistence out of tidal water by looking at it, were\r\ngathered together about the causeway. As her father\xe2\x80\x99s boat grounded,\r\nthey became contemplative of the mud, and dispersed themselves. She saw\r\nthat the mute avoidance had begun.\r\n\r\nGaffer saw it, too, in so far as that he was moved when he set foot on\r\nshore, to stare around him. But, he promptly set to work to haul up his\r\nboat, and make her fast, and take the sculls and rudder and rope out of\r\nher. Carrying these with Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s aid, he passed up to his dwelling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit close to the fire, father, dear, while I cook your breakfast.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s all ready for cooking, and only been waiting for you. You must be\r\nfrozen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Lizzie, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t of a glow; that\xe2\x80\x99s certain. And my hands seem\r\nnailed through to the sculls. See how dead they are!\xe2\x80\x99 Something\r\nsuggestive in their colour, and perhaps in her face, struck him as he\r\nheld them up; he turned his shoulder and held them down to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were not out in the perishing night, I hope, father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear. Lay aboard a barge, by a blazing coal-fire.--Where\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nboy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a drop of brandy for your tea, father, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll put it in\r\nwhile I turn this bit of meat. If the river was to get frozen, there\r\nwould be a deal of distress; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there, father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! there\xe2\x80\x99s always enough of that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Gaffer, dropping the liquor\r\ninto his cup from a squat black bottle, and dropping it slowly that it\r\nmight seem more; \xe2\x80\x98distress is for ever a going about, like sut in the\r\nair--Ain\xe2\x80\x99t that boy up yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The meat\xe2\x80\x99s ready now, father. Eat it while it\xe2\x80\x99s hot and comfortable.\r\nAfter you have finished, we\xe2\x80\x99ll turn round to the fire and talk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, he perceived that he was evaded, and, having thrown a hasty angry\r\nglance towards the bunk, plucked at a corner of her apron and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s gone with that boy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll begin your breakfast, I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit by and tell you.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nlooked at her, stirred his tea and took two or three gulps, then cut at\r\nhis piece of hot steak with his case-knife, and said, eating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then. What\xe2\x80\x99s gone with that boy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, dear. It seems, father, that he has quite a gift of\r\nlearning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral young beggar!\xe2\x80\x99 said the parent, shaking his knife in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that having this gift, and not being equally good at other things,\r\nhe has made shift to get some schooling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral young beggar!\xe2\x80\x99 said the parent again, with his former action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--And that knowing you have nothing to spare, father, and not wishing\r\nto be a burden on you, he gradually made up his mind to go seek his\r\nfortune out of learning. He went away this morning, father, and he cried\r\nvery much at going, and he hoped you would forgive him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let him never come a nigh me to ask me my forgiveness,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nfather, again emphasizing his words with the knife. \xe2\x80\x98Let him never come\r\nwithin sight of my eyes, nor yet within reach of my arm. His own father\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s disowned his own father. His own father\r\ntherefore, disowns him for ever and ever, as a unnat\xe2\x80\x99ral young beggar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had pushed away his plate. With the natural need of a strong rough\r\nman in anger, to do something forcible, he now clutched his knife\r\noverhand, and struck downward with it at the end of every succeeding\r\nsentence. As he would have struck with his own clenched fist if there\r\nhad chanced to be nothing in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s welcome to go. He\xe2\x80\x99s more welcome to go than to stay. But let him\r\nnever come back. Let him never put his head inside that door. And let\r\nyou never speak a word more in his favour, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll disown your own\r\nfather, likewise, and what your father says of him he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come to\r\nsay of you. Now I see why them men yonder held aloof from me. They says\r\nto one another, \xe2\x80\x9cHere comes the man as ain\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for his own\r\nson!\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie--!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, she stopped him with a cry. Looking at her he saw her, with a face\r\nquite strange to him, shrinking back against the wall, with her hands\r\nbefore her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, don\xe2\x80\x99t! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see you striking with it. Put it down!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at the knife; but in his astonishment still held it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, it\xe2\x80\x99s too horrible. O put it down, put it down!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nConfounded by her appearance and exclamation, he tossed it away, and\r\nstood up with his open hands held out before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s come to you, Liz? Can you think I would strike at you with a\r\nknife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, father, no; you would never hurt me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What should I hurt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, dear father. On my knees, I am certain, in my heart and soul\r\nI am certain, nothing! But it was too dreadful to bear; for it looked--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nher hands covering her face again, \xe2\x80\x98O it looked--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did it look like?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe recollection of his murderous figure, combining with her trial of\r\nlast night, and her trial of the morning, caused her to drop at his\r\nfeet, without having answered.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen her so before. He raised her with the utmost\r\ntenderness, calling her the best of daughters, and \xe2\x80\x98my poor pretty\r\ncreetur\xe2\x80\x99, and laid her head upon his knee, and tried to restore her. But\r\nfailing, he laid her head gently down again, got a pillow and placed it\r\nunder her dark hair, and sought on the table for a spoonful of brandy.\r\nThere being none left, he hurriedly caught up the empty bottle, and ran\r\nout at the door.\r\n\r\nHe returned as hurriedly as he had gone, with the bottle still empty.\r\nHe kneeled down by her, took her head on his arm, and moistened her lips\r\nwith a little water into which he dipped his fingers: saying, fiercely,\r\nas he looked around, now over this shoulder, now over that:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have we got a pest in the house? Is there summ\xe2\x80\x99at deadly sticking to my\r\nclothes? What\xe2\x80\x99s let loose upon us? Who loosed it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nMR WEGG LOOKS AFTER HIMSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nSilas Wegg, being on his road to the Roman Empire, approaches it by way\r\nof Clerkenwell. The time is early in the evening; the weather moist and\r\nraw. Mr Wegg finds leisure to make a little circuit, by reason that he\r\nfolds his screen early, now that he combines another source of income\r\nwith it, and also that he feels it due to himself to be anxiously\r\nexpected at the Bower. \xe2\x80\x98Boffin will get all the eagerer for waiting a\r\nbit,\xe2\x80\x99 says Silas, screwing up, as he stumps along, first his right eye,\r\nand then his left. Which is something superfluous in him, for Nature has\r\nalready screwed both pretty tight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I get on with him as I expect to get on,\xe2\x80\x99 Silas pursues, stumping\r\nand meditating, \xe2\x80\x98it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t become me to leave it here. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nrespectable.\xe2\x80\x99 Animated by this reflection, he stumps faster, and looks\r\na long way before him, as a man with an ambitious project in abeyance\r\noften will do.\r\n\r\nAware of a working-jeweller population taking sanctuary about the church\r\nin Clerkenwell, Mr Wegg is conscious of an interest in, and a respect\r\nfor, the neighbourhood. But, his sensations in this regard halt as to\r\ntheir strict morality, as he halts in his gait; for, they suggest the\r\ndelights of a coat of invisibility in which to walk off safely with the\r\nprecious stones and watch-cases, but stop short of any compunction for\r\nthe people who would lose the same.\r\n\r\nNot, however, towards the \xe2\x80\x98shops\xe2\x80\x99 where cunning artificers work in\r\npearls and diamonds and gold and silver, making their hands so rich,\r\nthat the enriched water in which they wash them is bought for the\r\nrefiners;--not towards these does Mr Wegg stump, but towards the poorer\r\nshops of small retail traders in commodities to eat and drink and keep\r\nfolks warm, and of Italian frame-makers, and of barbers, and of brokers,\r\nand of dealers in dogs and singing-birds. From these, in a narrow and\r\na dirty street devoted to such callings, Mr Wegg selects one dark\r\nshop-window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it, surrounded by a\r\nmuddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces of leather and dry stick,\r\nbut among which nothing is resolvable into anything distinct, save\r\nthe candle itself in its old tin candlestick, and two preserved frogs\r\nfighting a small-sword duel. Stumping with fresh vigour, he goes in at\r\nthe dark greasy entry, pushes a little greasy dark reluctant side-door,\r\nand follows the door into the little dark greasy shop. It is so dark\r\nthat nothing can be made out in it, over a little counter, but another\r\ntallow candle in another old tin candlestick, close to the face of a man\r\nstooping low in a chair.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg nods to the face, \xe2\x80\x98Good evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe face looking up is a sallow face with weak eyes, surmounted by a\r\ntangle of reddish-dusty hair. The owner of the face has no cravat on,\r\nand has opened his tumbled shirt-collar to work with the more ease.\r\nFor the same reason he has no coat on: only a loose waistcoat over his\r\nyellow linen. His eyes are like the over-tried eyes of an engraver, but\r\nhe is not that; his expression and stoop are like those of a shoemaker,\r\nbut he is not that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, Mr Venus. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith slowly dawning remembrance, Mr Venus rises, and holds his candle\r\nover the little counter, and holds it down towards the legs, natural and\r\nartificial, of Mr Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be SURE!\xe2\x80\x99 he says, then. \xe2\x80\x98How do you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wegg, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 that gentleman explains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says the other. \xe2\x80\x98Hospital amputation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Venus. \xe2\x80\x98How do you do? Sit down by the fire, and warm\r\nyour--your other one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little counter being so short a counter that it leaves the\r\nfireplace, which would have been behind it if it had been longer,\r\naccessible, Mr Wegg sits down on a box in front of the fire, and inhales\r\na warm and comfortable smell which is not the smell of the shop. \xe2\x80\x98For\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg inwardly decides, as he takes a corrective sniff or two,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is musty, leathery, feathery, cellary, gluey, gummy, and,\xe2\x80\x99 with another\r\nsniff, \xe2\x80\x98as it might be, strong of old pairs of bellows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My tea is drawing, and my muffin is on the hob, Mr Wegg; will you\r\npartake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt being one of Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s guiding rules in life always to partake, he\r\nsays he will. But, the little shop is so excessively dark, is stuck so\r\nfull of black shelves and brackets and nooks and corners, that he sees\r\nMr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s cup and saucer only because it is close under the candle, and\r\ndoes not see from what mysterious recess Mr Venus produces another\r\nfor himself until it is under his nose. Concurrently, Wegg perceives a\r\npretty little dead bird lying on the counter, with its head drooping\r\non one side against the rim of Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s saucer, and a long stiff wire\r\npiercing its breast. As if it were Cock Robin, the hero of the ballad,\r\nand Mr Venus were the sparrow with his bow and arrow, and Mr Wegg were\r\nthe fly with his little eye.\r\n\r\nMr Venus dives, and produces another muffin, yet untoasted; taking the\r\narrow out of the breast of Cock Robin, he proceeds to toast it on the\r\nend of that cruel instrument. When it is brown, he dives again and\r\nproduces butter, with which he completes his work.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg, as an artful man who is sure of his supper by-and-bye, presses\r\nmuffin on his host to soothe him into a compliant state of mind, or, as\r\none might say, to grease his works. As the muffins disappear, little by\r\nlittle, the black shelves and nooks and corners begin to appear, and Mr\r\nWegg gradually acquires an imperfect notion that over against him on the\r\nchimney-piece is a Hindoo baby in a bottle, curved up with his big\r\nhead tucked under him, as he would instantly throw a summersault if the\r\nbottle were large enough.\r\n\r\nWhen he deems Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s wheels sufficiently lubricated, Mr Wegg\r\napproaches his object by asking, as he lightly taps his hands together,\r\nto express an undesigning frame of mind:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how have I been going on, this long time, Mr Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very bad,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Venus, uncompromisingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Am I still at home?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Wegg, with an air of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be secretly agreeable to Wegg, but he veils his\r\nfeelings, and observes, \xe2\x80\x98Strange. To what do you attribute it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Venus, who is a haggard melancholy man, speaking\r\nin a weak voice of querulous complaint, \xe2\x80\x98to what to attribute it, Mr\r\nWegg. I can\xe2\x80\x99t work you into a miscellaneous one, no how. Do what I will,\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t be got to fit. Anybody with a passable knowledge would pick\r\nyou out at a look, and say,--\xe2\x80\x9cNo go! Don\xe2\x80\x99t match!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, but hang it, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg expostulates with some little\r\nirritation, \xe2\x80\x98that can\xe2\x80\x99t be personal and peculiar in ME. It must often\r\nhappen with miscellaneous ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With ribs (I grant you) always. But not else. When I prepare a\r\nmiscellaneous one, I know beforehand that I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep to nature, and\r\nbe miscellaneous with ribs, because every man has his own ribs, and no\r\nother man\xe2\x80\x99s will go with them; but elseways I can be miscellaneous. I\r\nhave just sent home a Beauty--a perfect Beauty--to a school of art. One\r\nleg Belgian, one leg English, and the pickings of eight other people in\r\nit. Talk of not being qualified to be miscellaneous! By rights you OUGHT\r\nto be, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas looks as hard at his one leg as he can in the dim light, and after\r\na pause sulkily opines \xe2\x80\x98that it must be the fault of the other people.\r\nOr how do you mean to say it comes about?\xe2\x80\x99 he demands impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it comes about. Stand up a minute. Hold the light.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Venus takes from a corner by his chair, the bones of a leg and foot,\r\nbeautifully pure, and put together with exquisite neatness. These he\r\ncompares with Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s leg; that gentleman looking on, as if he were\r\nbeing measured for a riding-boot. \xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is, but so it\r\nis. You have got a twist in that bone, to the best of my belief. I never\r\nsaw the likes of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg having looked distrustfully at his own limb, and suspiciously at\r\nthe pattern with which it has been compared, makes the point:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a pound that ain\xe2\x80\x99t an English one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An easy wager, when we run so much into foreign! No, it belongs to that\r\nFrench gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he nods towards a point of darkness behind Mr Wegg, the latter, with\r\na slight start, looks round for \xe2\x80\x98that French gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 whom he at\r\nlength descries to be represented (in a very workmanlike manner) by his\r\nribs only, standing on a shelf in another corner, like a piece of armour\r\nor a pair of stays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Wegg, with a sort of sense of being introduced; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndare say you were all right enough in your own country, but I hope no\r\nobjections will be taken to my saying that the Frenchman was never yet\r\nborn as I should wish to match.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this moment the greasy door is violently pushed inward, and a boy\r\nfollows it, who says, after having let it slam:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come for the stuffed canary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s three and ninepence,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Venus; \xe2\x80\x98have you got the money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy produces four shillings. Mr Venus, always in exceedingly low\r\nspirits and making whimpering sounds, peers about for the stuffed\r\ncanary. On his taking the candle to assist his search, Mr Wegg observes\r\nthat he has a convenient little shelf near his knees, exclusively\r\nappropriated to skeleton hands, which have very much the appearance of\r\nwanting to lay hold of him. From these Mr Venus rescues the canary in a\r\nglass case, and shows it to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 he whimpers. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s animation! On a twig, making up his mind\r\nto hop! Take care of him; he\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely specimen.--And three is four.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy gathers up his change and has pulled the door open by a leather\r\nstrap nailed to it for the purpose, when Venus cries out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop him! Come back, you young villain! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a tooth among them\r\nhalfpence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was I to know I\xe2\x80\x99d got it? You giv it me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want none of your\r\nteeth; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough of my own.\xe2\x80\x99 So the boy pipes, as he selects it\r\nfrom his change, and throws it on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t sauce ME, in the wicious pride of your youth,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Venus retorts\r\npathetically. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t hit ME because you see I\xe2\x80\x99m down. I\xe2\x80\x99m low enough\r\nwithout that. It dropped into the till, I suppose. They drop into\r\neverything. There was two in the coffee-pot at breakfast time. Molars.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, then,\xe2\x80\x99 argues the boy, \xe2\x80\x98what do you call names for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which Mr Venus only replies, shaking his shock of dusty hair, and\r\nwinking his weak eyes, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t sauce ME, in the wicious pride of your\r\nyouth; don\xe2\x80\x99t hit ME, because you see I\xe2\x80\x99m down. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea how small\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d come out, if I had the articulating of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis consideration seems to have its effect on the boy, for he goes out\r\ngrumbling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear me, dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 sighs Mr Venus, heavily, snuffing the candle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the world that appeared so flowery has ceased to blow! You\xe2\x80\x99re casting\r\nyour eye round the shop, Mr Wegg. Let me show you a light. My working\r\nbench. My young man\xe2\x80\x99s bench. A Wice. Tools. Bones, warious. Skulls,\r\nwarious. Preserved Indian baby. African ditto. Bottled preparations,\r\nwarious. Everything within reach of your hand, in good preservation.\r\nThe mouldy ones a-top. What\xe2\x80\x99s in those hampers over them again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nquite remember. Say, human warious. Cats. Articulated English baby.\r\nDogs. Ducks. Glass eyes, warious. Mummied bird. Dried cuticle, warious.\r\nOh, dear me! That\xe2\x80\x99s the general panoramic view.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving so held and waved the candle as that all these heterogeneous\r\nobjects seemed to come forward obediently when they were named, and\r\nthen retire again, Mr Venus despondently repeats, \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear me, dear\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99 resumes his seat, and with drooping despondency upon him, falls to\r\npouring himself out more tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where am I?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Mr Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re somewhere in the back shop across the yard, sir; and speaking\r\nquite candidly, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never bought you of the Hospital Porter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, look here, what did you give for me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Venus, blowing his tea: his head and face peering out\r\nof the darkness, over the smoke of it, as if he were modernizing the old\r\noriginal rise in his family: \xe2\x80\x98you were one of a warious lot, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas puts his point in the improved form of \xe2\x80\x98What will you take for\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Venus, still blowing his tea, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared, at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, to tell you, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come! According to your own account I\xe2\x80\x99m not worth much,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg reasons\r\npersuasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not for miscellaneous working in, I grant you, Mr Wegg; but you might\r\nturn out valuable yet, as a--\xe2\x80\x99 here Mr Venus takes a gulp of tea, so\r\nhot that it makes him choke, and sets his weak eyes watering; \xe2\x80\x98as a\r\nMonstrosity, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRepressing an indignant look, indicative of anything but a disposition\r\nto excuse him, Silas pursues his point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you know me, Mr Venus, and I think you know I never bargain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus takes gulps of hot tea, shutting his eyes at every gulp, and\r\nopening them again in a spasmodic manner; but does not commit himself to\r\nassent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have a prospect of getting on in life and elevating myself by my own\r\nindependent exertions,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg, feelingly, \xe2\x80\x98and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like--I\r\ntell you openly I should NOT like--under such circumstances, to be what\r\nI may call dispersed, a part of me here, and a part of me there, but\r\nshould wish to collect myself like a genteel person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a prospect at present, is it, Mr Wegg? Then you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the\r\nmoney for a deal about you? Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do with you;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you over. I am a man of my word, and you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of\r\nmy disposing of you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you over. That\xe2\x80\x99s a promise. Oh dear me,\r\ndear me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFain to accept his promise, and wishing to propitiate him, Mr Wegg looks\r\non as he sighs and pours himself out more tea, and then says, trying to\r\nget a sympathetic tone into his voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem very low, Mr Venus. Is business bad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was so good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is your hand out at all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was so well in. Mr Wegg, I\xe2\x80\x99m not only first in the trade, but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nTHE trade. You may go and buy a skeleton at the West End if you like,\r\nand pay the West End price, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll be my putting together. I\xe2\x80\x99ve as\r\nmuch to do as I can possibly do, with the assistance of my young man,\r\nand I take a pride and a pleasure in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus thus delivers himself, his right hand extended, his smoking\r\nsaucer in his left hand, protesting as though he were going to burst\r\ninto a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That ain\xe2\x80\x99t a state of things to make you low, Mr Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg, I know it ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Mr Wegg, not to name myself as a workman\r\nwithout an equal, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on improving myself in my knowledge of\r\nAnatomy, till both by sight and by name I\xe2\x80\x99m perfect. Mr Wegg, if you was\r\nbrought here loose in a bag to be articulated, I\xe2\x80\x99d name your smallest\r\nbones blindfold equally with your largest, as fast as I could pick \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nout, and I\xe2\x80\x99d sort \xe2\x80\x98em all, and sort your wertebrae, in a manner that\r\nwould equally surprise and charm you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 remarks Silas (though not quite so readily as last time), \xe2\x80\x98THAT\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a state of things to be low about.--Not for YOU to be low about,\r\nleastways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg, I know it ain\xe2\x80\x99t; Mr Wegg, I know it ain\xe2\x80\x99t. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the heart\r\nthat lowers me, it is the heart! Be so good as take and read that card\r\nout loud.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas receives one from his hand, which Venus takes from a wonderful\r\nlitter in a drawer, and putting on his spectacles, reads:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMr Venus,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cPreserver of Animals and Birds,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cArticulator of human bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 with a groan. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it! Mr Wegg, I\xe2\x80\x99m thirty-two, and a\r\nbachelor. Mr Wegg, I love her. Mr Wegg, she is worthy of being loved by\r\na Potentate!\xe2\x80\x99 Here Silas is rather alarmed by Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s springing to\r\nhis feet in the hurry of his spirits, and haggardly confronting him with\r\nhis hand on his coat collar; but Mr Venus, begging pardon, sits down\r\nagain, saying, with the calmness of despair, \xe2\x80\x98She objects to the\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does she know the profits of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She knows the profits of it, but she don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate the art of\r\nit, and she objects to it. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes in her own\r\nhandwriting, \xe2\x80\x9cto regard myself, nor yet to be regarded, in that boney\r\nlight\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus pours himself out more tea, with a look and in an attitude of\r\nthe deepest desolation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so a man climbs to the top of the tree, Mr Wegg, only to see that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no look-out when he\xe2\x80\x99s up there! I sit here of a night surrounded\r\nby the lovely trophies of my art, and what have they done for me? Ruined\r\nme. Brought me to the pass of being informed that \xe2\x80\x9cshe does not wish to\r\nregard herself, nor yet to be regarded, in that boney light\xe2\x80\x9d!\xe2\x80\x99 Having\r\nrepeated the fatal expressions, Mr Venus drinks more tea by gulps, and\r\noffers an explanation of his doing so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It lowers me. When I\xe2\x80\x99m equally lowered all over, lethargy sets in. By\r\nsticking to it till one or two in the morning, I get oblivion. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme detain you, Mr Wegg. I\xe2\x80\x99m not company for any one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not on that account,\xe2\x80\x99 says Silas, rising, \xe2\x80\x98but because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nan appointment. It\xe2\x80\x99s time I was at Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s, up Battle Bridge way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg admits that he is bound for that port.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be in a good thing, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve worked yourself in there.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s lots of money going, there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To think,\xe2\x80\x99 says Silas, \xe2\x80\x98that you should catch it up so quick, and know\r\nabout it. Wonderful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, Mr Wegg. The old gentleman wanted to know the nature and\r\nworth of everything that was found in the dust; and many\xe2\x80\x99s the bone, and\r\nfeather, and what not, that he\xe2\x80\x99s brought to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. (Oh dear me, dear me!) And he\xe2\x80\x99s buried quite in this\r\nneighbourhood, you know. Over yonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg does not know, but he makes as if he did, by responsively\r\nnodding his head. He also follows with his eyes, the toss of Venus\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead: as if to seek a direction to over yonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took an interest in that discovery in the river,\xe2\x80\x99 says Venus.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98(She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t written her cutting refusal at that time.) I\xe2\x80\x99ve got up\r\nthere--never mind, though.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had raised the candle at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length towards one of the dark\r\nshelves, and Mr Wegg had turned to look, when he broke off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old gentleman was well known all round here. There used to be\r\nstories about his having hidden all kinds of property in those dust\r\nmounds. I suppose there was nothing in \xe2\x80\x98em. Probably you know, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing in \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg, who has never heard a word of this before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me detain you. Good night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Mr Venus gives him a shake of the hand with a shake of\r\nhis own head, and drooping down in his chair, proceeds to pour himself\r\nout more tea. Mr Wegg, looking back over his shoulder as he pulls the\r\ndoor open by the strap, notices that the movement so shakes the crazy\r\nshop, and so shakes a momentary flare out of the candle, as that the\r\nbabies--Hindoo, African, and British--the \xe2\x80\x98human warious\xe2\x80\x99, the French\r\ngentleman, the green glass-eyed cats, the dogs, the ducks, and all\r\nthe rest of the collection, show for an instant as if paralytically\r\nanimated; while even poor little Cock Robin at Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s elbow turns\r\nover on his innocent side. Next moment, Mr Wegg is stumping under the\r\ngaslights and through the mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nMR BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhosoever had gone out of Fleet Street into the Temple at the date of\r\nthis history, and had wandered disconsolate about the Temple until he\r\nstumbled on a dismal churchyard, and had looked up at the dismal windows\r\ncommanding that churchyard until at the most dismal window of them\r\nall he saw a dismal boy, would in him have beheld, at one grand\r\ncomprehensive swoop of the eye, the managing clerk, junior clerk,\r\ncommon-law clerk, conveyancing clerk, chancery clerk, every refinement\r\nand department of clerk, of Mr Mortimer Lightwood, erewhile called in\r\nthe newspapers eminent solicitor.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin having been several times in communication with this clerkly\r\nessence, both on its own ground and at the Bower, had no difficulty in\r\nidentifying it when he saw it up in its dusty eyrie. To the second floor\r\non which the window was situated, he ascended, much pre-occupied in mind\r\nby the uncertainties besetting the Roman Empire, and much regretting the\r\ndeath of the amiable Pertinax: who only last night had left the Imperial\r\naffairs in a state of great confusion, by falling a victim to the fury\r\nof the praetorian guards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Morning, morning, morning!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with a wave of his hand, as\r\nthe office door was opened by the dismal boy, whose appropriate name was\r\nBlight. \xe2\x80\x98Governor in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood gave you an appointment, sir, I think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to give it, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay\r\nmy way, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No doubt, sir. Would you walk in? Mr Lightwood ain\xe2\x80\x99t in at the present\r\nmoment, but I expect him back very shortly. Would you take a seat in Mr\r\nLightwood\xe2\x80\x99s room, sir, while I look over our Appointment Book?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYoung Blight made a great show of fetching from his desk a long thin\r\nmanuscript volume with a brown paper cover, and running his finger down\r\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s appointments, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Aggs, Mr Baggs, Mr Caggs, Mr\r\nDaggs, Mr Faggs, Mr Gaggs, Mr Boffin. Yes, sir; quite right. You are a\r\nlittle before your time, sir. Mr Lightwood will be in directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a hurry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the opportunity, if you please, of entering\r\nyour name in our Callers\xe2\x80\x99 Book for the day.\xe2\x80\x99 Young Blight made another\r\ngreat show of changing the volume, taking up a pen, sucking it, dipping\r\nit, and running over previous entries before he wrote. As, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Alley,\r\nMr Balley, Mr Calley, Mr Dalley, Mr Falley, Mr Galley, Mr Halley, Mr\r\nLalley, Mr Malley. And Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strict system here; eh, my lad?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, as he was booked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the boy. \xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on without it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy which he probably meant that his mind would have been shattered to\r\npieces without this fiction of an occupation. Wearing in his solitary\r\nconfinement no fetters that he could polish, and being provided with no\r\ndrinking-cup that he could carve, he had fallen on the device of ringing\r\nalphabetical changes into the two volumes in question, or of entering\r\nvast numbers of persons out of the Directory as transacting business\r\nwith Mr Lightwood. It was the more necessary for his spirits, because,\r\nbeing of a sensitive temperament, he was apt to consider it personally\r\ndisgraceful to himself that his master had no clients.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long have you been in the law, now?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, with a\r\npounce, in his usual inquisitive way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the law, now, sir, about three years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must have been as good as born in it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with admiration.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it much,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Young Blight, heaving a sigh, as if its\r\nbitterness were past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What wages do you get?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half what I could wish,\xe2\x80\x99 replied young Blight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the whole that you could wish?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fifteen shillings a week,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About how long might it take you now, at a average rate of going, to be\r\na Judge?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, after surveying his small stature in silence.\r\n\r\nThe boy answered that he had not yet quite worked out that little\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to prevent your going in for it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin.\r\n\r\nThe boy virtually replied that as he had the honour to be a Briton who\r\nnever never never, there was nothing to prevent his going in for it. Yet\r\nhe seemed inclined to suspect that there might be something to prevent\r\nhis coming out with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would a couple of pound help you up at all?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nOn this head, young Blight had no doubt whatever, so Mr Boffin made him\r\na present of that sum of money, and thanked him for his attention to his\r\n(Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s) affairs; which, he added, were now, he believed, as good\r\nas settled.\r\n\r\nThen Mr Boffin, with his stick at his ear, like a Familiar Spirit\r\nexplaining the office to him, sat staring at a little bookcase of Law\r\nPractice and Law Reports, and at a window, and at an empty blue bag, and\r\nat a stick of sealing-wax, and a pen, and a box of wafers, and an apple,\r\nand a writing-pad--all very dusty--and at a number of inky smears\r\nand blots, and at an imperfectly-disguised gun-case pretending to be\r\nsomething legal, and at an iron box labelled HARMON ESTATE, until Mr\r\nLightwood appeared.\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood explained that he came from the proctor\xe2\x80\x99s, with whom he had\r\nbeen engaged in transacting Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s affairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And they seem to have taken a deal out of you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with\r\ncommiseration.\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood, without explaining that his weariness was chronic,\r\nproceeded with his exposition that, all forms of law having been at\r\nlength complied with, will of Harmon deceased having been proved, death\r\nof Harmon next inheriting having been proved, &c., and so forth, Court\r\nof Chancery having been moved, &c. and so forth, he, Mr Lightwood, had\r\nnow the gratification, honour, and happiness, again &c. and so forth, of\r\ncongratulating Mr Boffin on coming into possession as residuary legatee,\r\nof upwards of one hundred thousand pounds, standing in the books of the\r\nGovernor and Company of the Bank of England, again &c. and so forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what is particularly eligible in the property Mr Boffin, is, that\r\nit involves no trouble. There are no estates to manage, no rents to\r\nreturn so much per cent upon in bad times (which is an extremely dear\r\nway of getting your name into the newspapers), no voters to become\r\nparboiled in hot water with, no agents to take the cream off the\r\nmilk before it comes to table. You could put the whole in a cash-box\r\nto-morrow morning, and take it with you to--say, to the Rocky Mountains.\r\nInasmuch as every man,\xe2\x80\x99 concluded Mr Lightwood, with an indolent smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98appears to be under a fatal spell which obliges him, sooner or later,\r\nto mention the Rocky Mountains in a tone of extreme familiarity to some\r\nother man, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse my pressing you into the service of that\r\ngigantic range of geographical bores.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout following this last remark very closely, Mr Boffin cast his\r\nperplexed gaze first at the ceiling, and then at the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say about it, I am sure. I\r\nwas a\xe2\x80\x99most as well as I was. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great lot to take care of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mr Boffin, then DON\xe2\x80\x99T take care of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speaking now,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98with the irresponsible imbecility\r\nof a private individual, and not with the profundity of a professional\r\nadviser, I should say that if the circumstance of its being too much,\r\nweighs upon your mind, you have the haven of consolation open to you\r\nthat you can easily make it less. And if you should be apprehensive of\r\nthe trouble of doing so, there is the further haven of consolation that\r\nany number of people will take the trouble off your hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see it,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Boffin, still perplexed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfactory, you know, what you\xe2\x80\x99re a-saying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Anything satisfactory, Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mortimer, raising his\r\neyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to find it so,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr Boffin, with a wistful look. \xe2\x80\x98While\r\nI was foreman at the Bower--afore it WAS the Bower--I considered the\r\nbusiness very satisfactory. The old man was a awful Tartar (saying\r\nit, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, without disrespect to his memory) but the business was\r\na pleasant one to look after, from before daylight to past dark. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na\xe2\x80\x99most a pity,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, rubbing his ear, \xe2\x80\x98that he ever went and\r\nmade so much money. It would have been better for him if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t so\r\ngiven himself up to it. You may depend upon it,\xe2\x80\x99 making the discovery\r\nall of a sudden, \xe2\x80\x98that HE found it a great lot to take care of!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood coughed, not convinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And speaking of satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98why, Lord save\r\nus! when we come to take it to pieces, bit by bit, where\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nsatisfactoriness of the money as yet? When the old man does right the\r\npoor boy after all, the poor boy gets no good of it. He gets made away\r\nwith, at the moment when he\xe2\x80\x99s lifting (as one may say) the cup and\r\nsarser to his lips. Mr Lightwood, I will now name to you, that on behalf\r\nof the poor dear boy, me and Mrs Boffin have stood out against the old\r\nman times out of number, till he has called us every name he could lay\r\nhis tongue to. I have seen him, after Mrs Boffin has given him her mind\r\nrespecting the claims of the nat\xe2\x80\x99ral affections, catch off Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbonnet (she wore, in general, a black straw, perched as a matter of\r\nconvenience on the top of her head), and send it spinning across\r\nthe yard. I have indeed. And once, when he did this in a manner that\r\namounted to personal, I should have given him a rattler for himself, if\r\nMrs Boffin hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thrown herself betwixt us, and received flush on the\r\ntemple. Which dropped her, Mr Lightwood. Dropped her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood murmured \xe2\x80\x98Equal honour--Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s head and heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You understand; I name this,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98to show you, now the\r\naffairs are wound up, that me and Mrs Boffin have ever stood as we were\r\nin Christian honour bound, the children\xe2\x80\x99s friend. Me and Mrs Boffin\r\nstood the poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s friend; me and Mrs Boffin stood the poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend; me and Mrs Boffin up and faced the old man when we momently\r\nexpected to be turned out for our pains. As to Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x98she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t wish it mentioned now she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nFashionable, but she went so far as to tell him, in my presence, he was\r\na flinty-hearted rascal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lightwood murmured \xe2\x80\x98Vigorous Saxon spirit--Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nancestors--bowmen--Agincourt and Cressy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The last time me and Mrs Boffin saw the poor boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin,\r\nwarming (as fat usually does) with a tendency to melt, \xe2\x80\x98he was a child\r\nof seven year old. For when he came back to make intercession for his\r\nsister, me and Mrs Boffin were away overlooking a country contract which\r\nwas to be sifted before carted, and he was come and gone in a single\r\nhour. I say he was a child of seven year old. He was going away, all\r\nalone and forlorn, to that foreign school, and he come into our place,\r\nsituate up the yard of the present Bower, to have a warm at our fire.\r\nThere was his little scanty travelling clothes upon him. There was his\r\nlittle scanty box outside in the shivering wind, which I was going to\r\ncarry for him down to the steamboat, as the old man wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of\r\nallowing a sixpence coach-money. Mrs Boffin, then quite a young woman\r\nand pictur of a full-blown rose, stands him by her, kneels down at the\r\nfire, warms her two open hands, and falls to rubbing his cheeks; but\r\nseeing the tears come into the child\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, the tears come fast into\r\nher own, and she holds him round the neck, like as if she was protecting\r\nhim, and cries to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give the wide wide world, I would, to run\r\naway with him!\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t say but what it cut me, and but what it at the\r\nsame time heightened my feelings of admiration for Mrs Boffin. The poor\r\nchild clings to her for awhile, as she clings to him, and then, when\r\nthe old man calls, he says \xe2\x80\x9cI must go! God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d and for a moment\r\nrests his heart against her bosom, and looks up at both of us, as if it\r\nwas in pain--in agony. Such a look! I went aboard with him (I gave him\r\nfirst what little treat I thought he\xe2\x80\x99d like), and I left him when he had\r\nfallen asleep in his berth, and I came back to Mrs Boffin. But tell\r\nher what I would of how I had left him, it all went for nothing, for,\r\naccording to her thoughts, he never changed that look that he had looked\r\nup at us two. But it did one piece of good. Mrs Boffin and me had no\r\nchild of our own, and had sometimes wished that how we had one. But not\r\nnow. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might both of us die,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x9cand other eyes might\r\nsee that lonely look in our child.\xe2\x80\x9d So of a night, when it was very\r\ncold, or when the wind roared, or the rain dripped heavy, she would\r\nwake sobbing, and call out in a fluster, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface? O shelter the poor child!\xe2\x80\x9d--till in course of years it gently wore\r\nout, as many things do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mr Boffin, everything wears to rags,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, with a\r\nlight laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to say everything,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, on whom\r\nhis manner seemed to grate, \xe2\x80\x98because there\xe2\x80\x99s some things that I never\r\nfound among the dust. Well, sir. So Mrs Boffin and me grow older and\r\nolder in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s service, living and working pretty hard in it,\r\ntill the old man is discovered dead in his bed. Then Mrs Boffin and me\r\nseal up his box, always standing on the table at the side of his bed,\r\nand having frequently heerd tell of the Temple as a spot where lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndust is contracted for, I come down here in search of a lawyer to\r\nadvise, and I see your young man up at this present elevation, chopping\r\nat the flies on the window-sill with his penknife, and I give him a Hoy!\r\nnot then having the pleasure of your acquaintance, and by that\r\nmeans come to gain the honour. Then you, and the gentleman in the\r\nuncomfortable neck-cloth under the little archway in Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChurchyard--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understood it was another name,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, pausing, \xe2\x80\x98but you\r\nknow best. Then you and Doctor Scommons, you go to work, and you do the\r\nthing that\xe2\x80\x99s proper, and you and Doctor S. take steps for finding out\r\nthe poor boy, and at last you do find out the poor boy, and me and Mrs\r\nBoffin often exchange the observation, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see him again,\r\nunder happy circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d But it was never to be; and the want of\r\nsatisfactoriness is, that after all the money never gets to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it gets,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Lightwood, with a languid inclination of the\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x98into excellent hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It gets into the hands of me and Mrs Boffin only this very day and\r\nhour, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am working round to, having waited for this day\r\nand hour a\xe2\x80\x99 purpose. Mr Lightwood, here has been a wicked cruel\r\nmurder. By that murder me and Mrs Boffin mysteriously profit. For the\r\napprehension and conviction of the murderer, we offer a reward of one\r\ntithe of the property--a reward of Ten Thousand Pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood, me and Mrs Boffin have fixed the sum together, and we\r\nstand to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But let me represent to you,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98speaking now with\r\nprofessional profundity, and not with individual imbecility, that the\r\noffer of such an immense reward is a temptation to forced suspicion,\r\nforced construction of circumstances, strained accusation, a whole\r\ntool-box of edged tools.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, a little staggered, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the sum we put o\xe2\x80\x99\r\none side for the purpose. Whether it shall be openly declared in the new\r\nnotices that must now be put about in our names--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In your name, Mr Boffin; in your name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well; in my name, which is the same as Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s, and means\r\nboth of us, is to be considered in drawing \xe2\x80\x98em up. But this is the first\r\ninstruction that I, as the owner of the property, give to my lawyer on\r\ncoming into it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your lawyer, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lightwood, making a very short\r\nnote of it with a very rusty pen, \xe2\x80\x98has the gratification of taking the\r\ninstruction. There is another?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is just one other, and no more. Make me as compact a little will\r\nas can be reconciled with tightness, leaving the whole of the property\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cmy beloved wife, Henerietty Boffin, sole executrix\xe2\x80\x9d. Make it as\r\nshort as you can, using those words; but make it tight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt some loss to fathom Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s notions of a tight will, Lightwood\r\nfelt his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, but professional profundity must be exact. When you\r\nsay tight--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean tight,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so. And nothing can be more laudable. But is the tightness to\r\nbind Mrs Boffin to any and what conditions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bind Mrs Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 interposed her husband. \xe2\x80\x98No! What are you thinking\r\nof! What I want is, to make it all hers so tight as that her hold of it\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be loosed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hers freely, to do what she likes with? Hers absolutely?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Boffin, with a short sturdy laugh. \xe2\x80\x98Hah! I\r\nshould think so! It would be handsome in me to begin to bind Mrs Boffin\r\nat this time of day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo that instruction, too, was taken by Mr Lightwood; and Mr Lightwood,\r\nhaving taken it, was in the act of showing Mr Boffin out, when Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn almost jostled him in the door-way. Consequently Mr Lightwood\r\nsaid, in his cool manner, \xe2\x80\x98Let me make you two known to one another,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand further signified that Mr Wrayburn was counsel learned in the\r\nlaw, and that, partly in the way of business and partly in the way of\r\npleasure, he had imparted to Mr Wrayburn some of the interesting facts\r\nof Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s biography.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Delighted,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene--though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look so--\xe2\x80\x98to know Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee, sir, thankee,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98And how do YOU like\r\nthe law?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A--not particularly,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too dry for you, eh? Well, I suppose it wants some years of sticking\r\nto, before you master it. But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like work. Look at the\r\nbees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, with a reluctant smile, \xe2\x80\x98but will\r\nyou excuse my mentioning that I always protest against being referred to\r\nthe bees?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I object on principle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98as a biped--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a what?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a two-footed creature;--I object on principle, as a two-footed\r\ncreature, to being constantly referred to insects and four-footed\r\ncreatures. I object to being required to model my proceedings according\r\nto the proceedings of the bee, or the dog, or the spider, or the camel.\r\nI fully admit that the camel, for instance, is an excessively temperate\r\nperson; but he has several stomachs to entertain himself with, and I\r\nhave only one. Besides, I am not fitted up with a convenient cool cellar\r\nto keep my drink in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I said, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Boffin, rather at a loss for an answer,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the bee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly. And may I represent to you that it\xe2\x80\x99s injudicious to say the\r\nbee? For the whole case is assumed. Conceding for a moment that there is\r\nany analogy between a bee, and a man in a shirt and pantaloons (which\r\nI deny), and that it is settled that the man is to learn from the bee\r\n(which I also deny), the question still remains, what is he to learn?\r\nTo imitate? Or to avoid? When your friends the bees worry themselves to\r\nthat highly fluttered extent about their sovereign, and become perfectly\r\ndistracted touching the slightest monarchical movement, are we men to\r\nlearn the greatness of Tuft-hunting, or the littleness of the\r\nCourt Circular? I am not clear, Mr Boffin, but that the hive may be\r\nsatirical.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At all events, they work,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye-es,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, disparagingly, \xe2\x80\x98they work; but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nthey overdo it? They work so much more than they need--they make so much\r\nmore than they can eat--they are so incessantly boring and buzzing at\r\ntheir one idea till Death comes upon them--that don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they\r\noverdo it? And are human labourers to have no holidays, because of the\r\nbees? And am I never to have change of air, because the bees don\xe2\x80\x99t? Mr\r\nBoffin, I think honey excellent at breakfast; but, regarded in the light\r\nof my conventional schoolmaster and moralist, I protest against the\r\ntyrannical humbug of your friend the bee. With the highest respect for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Morning, morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, the worthy Mr Boffin jogged away with a comfortless impression he\r\ncould have dispensed with, that there was a deal of unsatisfactoriness\r\nin the world, besides what he had recalled as appertaining to the Harmon\r\nproperty. And he was still jogging along Fleet Street in this condition\r\nof mind, when he became aware that he was closely tracked and observed\r\nby a man of genteel appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, stopping short, with his meditations brought\r\nto an abrupt check, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the next article?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name too, eh? How did you come by it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin looked full at the man, and the man looked full at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, after a glance at the pavement, as if it were made\r\nof faces and he were trying to match the man\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x98I DON\xe2\x80\x99T know you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am nobody,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x98and not likely to be known; but Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s wealth--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! that\xe2\x80\x99s got about already, has it?\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--And his romantic manner of acquiring it, make him conspicuous. You\r\nwere pointed out to me the other day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I should say I was a disappintment to you when\r\nI WAS pinted out, if your politeness would allow you to confess it, for\r\nI am well aware I am not much to look at. What might you want with me?\r\nNot in the law, are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No information to give, for a reward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere may have been a momentary mantling in the face of the man as he\r\nmade the last answer, but it passed directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake, you have followed me from my lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s and tried\r\nto fix my attention. Say out! Have you? Or haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mr\r\nBoffin, rather angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why have you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will allow me to walk beside you, Mr Boffin, I will tell you.\r\nWould you object to turn aside into this place--I think it is called\r\nClifford\xe2\x80\x99s Inn--where we can hear one another better than in the roaring\r\nstreet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98if he proposes a game at skittles, or meets\r\na country gentleman just come into property, or produces any article\r\nof jewellery he has found, I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock him down!\xe2\x80\x99 With this discreet\r\nreflection, and carrying his stick in his arms much as Punch carries\r\nhis, Mr Boffin turned into Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s Inn aforesaid.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, I happened to be in Chancery Lane this morning, when I saw\r\nyou going along before me. I took the liberty of following you, trying\r\nto make up my mind to speak to you, till you went into your lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThen I waited outside till you came out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t quite sound like skittles, nor yet country gentleman, nor yet\r\njewellery,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98but there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid my object is a bold one, I am afraid it has little of the\r\nusual practical world about it, but I venture it. If you ask me, or if\r\nyou ask yourself--which is more likely--what emboldens me, I answer, I\r\nhave been strongly assured, that you are a man of rectitude and plain\r\ndealing, with the soundest of sound hearts, and that you are blessed in\r\na wife distinguished by the same qualities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your information is true of Mrs Boffin, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanswer, as he surveyed his new friend again. There was something\r\nrepressed in the strange man\xe2\x80\x99s manner, and he walked with his eyes\r\non the ground--though conscious, for all that, of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservation--and he spoke in a subdued voice. But his words came easily,\r\nand his voice was agreeable in tone, albeit constrained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I add, I can discern for myself what the general tongue says of\r\nyou--that you are quite unspoiled by Fortune, and not uplifted--I trust\r\nyou will not, as a man of an open nature, suspect that I mean to flatter\r\nyou, but will believe that all I mean is to excuse myself, these being\r\nmy only excuses for my present intrusion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98How much?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98It must be coming to money. How much?\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will probably change your manner of living, Mr Boffin, in your\r\nchanged circumstances. You will probably keep a larger house, have many\r\nmatters to arrange, and be beset by numbers of correspondents. If you\r\nwould try me as your Secretary--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As WHAT?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, with his eyes wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your Secretary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, under his breath, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s a queer thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the stranger, wondering at Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s wonder, \xe2\x80\x98if you\r\nwould try me as your man of business under any name, I know you would\r\nfind me faithful and grateful, and I hope you would find me useful. You\r\nmay naturally think that my immediate object is money. Not so, for\r\nI would willingly serve you a year--two years--any term you might\r\nappoint--before that should begin to be a consideration between us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where do you come from?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I come,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, meeting his eye, \xe2\x80\x98from many countries.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintances with the names and situations of foreign lands\r\nbeing limited in extent and somewhat confused in quality, he shaped his\r\nnext question on an elastic model.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From--any particular place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been in many places.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you been?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nHere again he made no great advance, for the reply was, \xe2\x80\x98I have been a\r\nstudent and a traveller.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a liberty to plump it out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98what do\r\nyou do for your living?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have mentioned,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, with another look at him, and\r\na smile, \xe2\x80\x98what I aspire to do. I have been superseded as to some slight\r\nintentions I had, and I may say that I have now to begin life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot very well knowing how to get rid of this applicant, and feeling the\r\nmore embarrassed because his manner and appearance claimed a delicacy\r\nin which the worthy Mr Boffin feared he himself might be deficient, that\r\ngentleman glanced into the mouldy little plantation or cat-preserve, of\r\nClifford\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, as it was that day, in search of a suggestion. Sparrows\r\nwere there, cats were there, dry-rot and wet-rot were there, but it was\r\nnot otherwise a suggestive spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this time,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, producing a little pocket-book and\r\ntaking out a card, \xe2\x80\x98I have not mentioned my name. My name is Rokesmith.\r\nI lodge at one Mr Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s, at Holloway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin stared again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father of Miss Bella Wilfer?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My landlord has a daughter named Bella. Yes; no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, this name had been more or less in Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts all the\r\nmorning, and for days before; therefore he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s singular, too!\xe2\x80\x99 unconsciously staring again, past all bounds of\r\ngood manners, with the card in his hand. \xe2\x80\x98Though, by-the-bye, I suppose\r\nit was one of that family that pinted me out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I have never been in the streets with one of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heard me talked of among \xe2\x80\x98em, though?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I occupy my own rooms, and have held scarcely any communication\r\nwith them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Odder and odder!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, to tell you the truth, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Rokesmith; \xe2\x80\x98allow me to call on you in a few\r\ndays. I am not so unconscionable as to think it likely that you would\r\naccept me on trust at first sight, and take me out of the very street.\r\nLet me come to you for your further opinion, at your leisure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s fair, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t object,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98but it must be on\r\ncondition that it\xe2\x80\x99s fully understood that I no more know that I shall\r\never be in want of any gentleman as Secretary--it WAS Secretary you\r\nsaid; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes opened wide, and he stared at the applicant from\r\nhead to foot, repeating \xe2\x80\x98Queer!--You\xe2\x80\x99re sure it was Secretary? Are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I said so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x98As Secretary,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Boffin, meditating upon the word; \xe2\x80\x98I no\r\nmore know that I may ever want a Secretary, or what not, than I do that\r\nI shall ever be in want of the man in the moon. Me and Mrs Boffin have\r\nnot even settled that we shall make any change in our way of life. Mrs\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s inclinations certainly do tend towards Fashion; but, being\r\nalready set up in a fashionable way at the Bower, she may not make\r\nfurther alterations. However, sir, as you don\xe2\x80\x99t press yourself, I wish\r\nto meet you so far as saying, by all means call at the Bower if you\r\nlike. Call in the course of a week or two. At the same time, I consider\r\nthat I ought to name, in addition to what I have already named, that I\r\nhave in my employment a literary man--WITH a wooden leg--as I have no\r\nthoughts of parting from.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I regret to hear I am in some sort anticipated,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Rokesmith answered,\r\nevidently having heard it with surprise; \xe2\x80\x98but perhaps other duties might\r\narise?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, with a confidential sense of dignity, \xe2\x80\x98as\r\nto my literary man\xe2\x80\x99s duties, they\xe2\x80\x99re clear. Professionally he declines\r\nand he falls, and as a friend he drops into poetry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout observing that these duties seemed by no means clear to Mr\r\nRokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s astonished comprehension, Mr Boffin went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wish you good-day. You can call at the Bower any\r\ntime in a week or two. It\xe2\x80\x99s not above a mile or so from you, and your\r\nlandlord can direct you to it. But as he may not know it by its new\r\nname of Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower, say, when you inquire of him, it\xe2\x80\x99s Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harmoon\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Rokesmith, seeming to have caught the sound\r\nimperfectly, \xe2\x80\x98Harmarn\xe2\x80\x99s. How do you spell it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, as to the spelling of it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, with great presence\r\nof mind, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s YOUR look out. Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s is all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say to\r\nHIM. Morning, morning, morning!\xe2\x80\x99 And so departed, without looking back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nMR AND MRS BOFFIN IN CONSULTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBetaking himself straight homeward, Mr Boffin, without further let or\r\nhindrance, arrived at the Bower, and gave Mrs Boffin (in a walking dress\r\nof black velvet and feathers, like a mourning coach-horse) an account of\r\nall he had said and done since breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This brings us round, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he then pursued, \xe2\x80\x98to the question\r\nwe left unfinished: namely, whether there\xe2\x80\x99s to be any new go-in for\r\nFashion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I want, Noddy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, smoothing her\r\ndress with an air of immense enjoyment, \xe2\x80\x98I want Society.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fashionable Society, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, laughing with the glee of a child. \xe2\x80\x98Yes! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno good my being kept here like Wax-Work; is it now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98People have to pay to see Wax-Work, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her husband,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98whereas (though you\xe2\x80\x99d be cheap at the same money) the neighbours is\r\nwelcome to see YOU for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it don\xe2\x80\x99t answer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cheerful Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98When we worked\r\nlike the neighbours, we suited one another. Now we have left work off;\r\nwe have left off suiting one another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, do you think of beginning work again?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin hinted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Out of the question! We have come into a great fortune, and we must do\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s right by our fortune; we must act up to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, who had a deep respect for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s intuitive wisdom,\r\nreplied, though rather pensively: \xe2\x80\x98I suppose we must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s never been acted up to yet, and, consequently, no good has come of\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, to the present time,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin assented, with his former\r\npensiveness, as he took his seat upon his settle. \xe2\x80\x98I hope good may be\r\ncoming of it in the future time. Towards which, what\xe2\x80\x99s your views, old\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin, a smiling creature, broad of figure and simple of nature,\r\nwith her hands folded in her lap, and with buxom creases in her throat,\r\nproceeded to expound her views.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, a good house in a good neighbourhood, good things about us,\r\ngood living, and good society. I say, live like our means, without\r\nextravagance, and be happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I say be happy, too,\xe2\x80\x99 assented the still pensive Mr Boffin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor-a-mussy!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Boffin, laughing and clapping her hands,\r\nand gaily rocking herself to and fro, \xe2\x80\x98when I think of me in a light\r\nyellow chariot and pair, with silver boxes to the wheels--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you was thinking of that, was you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the delighted creature. \xe2\x80\x98And with a footman up behind, with\r\na bar across, to keep his legs from being poled! And with a coachman\r\nup in front, sinking down into a seat big enough for three of him, all\r\ncovered with upholstery in green and white! And with two bay horses\r\ntossing their heads and stepping higher than they trot long-ways! And\r\nwith you and me leaning back inside, as grand as ninepence! Oh-h-h-h My!\r\nHa ha ha ha ha!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin clapped her hands again, rocked herself again, beat her feet\r\nupon the floor, and wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what, my old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr Boffin, when he also had\r\nsympathetically laughed: \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s your views on the subject of the\r\nBower?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shut it up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t part with it, but put somebody in it, to keep it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any other views?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noddy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, coming from her fashionable sofa to his side\r\non the plain settle, and hooking her comfortable arm through his,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next I think--and I really have been thinking early and late--of the\r\ndisappointed girl; her that was so cruelly disappointed, you know, both\r\nof her husband and his riches. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think we might do something for\r\nher? Have her to live with us? Or something of that sort?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ne-ver once thought of the way of doing it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, smiting\r\nthe table in his admiration. \xe2\x80\x98What a thinking steam-ingein this old lady\r\nis. And she don\xe2\x80\x99t know how she does it. Neither does the ingein!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin pulled his nearest ear, in acknowledgment of this piece of\r\nphilosophy, and then said, gradually toning down to a motherly strain:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last, and not least, I have taken a fancy. You remember dear little\r\nJohn Harmon, before he went to school? Over yonder across the yard, at\r\nour fire? Now that he is past all benefit of the money, and it\xe2\x80\x99s come to\r\nus, I should like to find some orphan child, and take the boy and adopt\r\nhim and give him John\xe2\x80\x99s name, and provide for him. Somehow, it would\r\nmake me easier, I fancy. Say it\xe2\x80\x99s only a whim--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t say so,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, but deary, if you did--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be a Beast if I did,\xe2\x80\x99 her husband interposed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s as much as to say you agree? Good and kind of you, and like you,\r\ndeary! And don\xe2\x80\x99t you begin to find it pleasant now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin,\r\nonce more radiant in her comely way from head to foot, and once more\r\nsmoothing her dress with immense enjoyment, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you begin to find\r\nit pleasant already, to think that a child will be made brighter, and\r\nbetter, and happier, because of that poor sad child that day? And isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit pleasant to know that the good will be done with the poor sad child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and it\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant to know that you are Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said her\r\nhusband, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a pleasant thing to know this many and many a\r\nyear!\xe2\x80\x99 It was ruin to Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations, but, having so spoken,\r\nthey sat side by side, a hopelessly Unfashionable pair.\r\n\r\nThese two ignorant and unpolished people had guided themselves so far on\r\nin their journey of life, by a religious sense of duty and desire to do\r\nright. Ten thousand weaknesses and absurdities might have been detected\r\nin the breasts of both; ten thousand vanities additional, possibly, in\r\nthe breast of the woman. But the hard wrathful and sordid nature that\r\nhad wrung as much work out of them as could be got in their best days,\r\nfor as little money as could be paid to hurry on their worst, had never\r\nbeen so warped but that it knew their moral straightness and respected\r\nit. In its own despite, in a constant conflict with itself and them, it\r\nhad done so. And this is the eternal law. For, Evil often stops short at\r\nitself and dies with the doer of it; but Good, never.\r\n\r\nThrough his most inveterate purposes, the dead Jailer of Harmony Jail\r\nhad known these two faithful servants to be honest and true. While he\r\nraged at them and reviled them for opposing him with the speech of the\r\nhonest and true, it had scratched his stony heart, and he had perceived\r\nthe powerlessness of all his wealth to buy them if he had addressed\r\nhimself to the attempt. So, even while he was their griping taskmaster\r\nand never gave them a good word, he had written their names down in his\r\nwill. So, even while it was his daily declaration that he mistrusted all\r\nmankind--and sorely indeed he did mistrust all who bore any resemblance\r\nto himself--he was as certain that these two people, surviving him,\r\nwould be trustworthy in all things from the greatest to the least, as he\r\nwas that he must surely die.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin, sitting side by side, with Fashion withdrawn to an\r\nimmeasurable distance, fell to discussing how they could best find their\r\norphan. Mrs Boffin suggested advertisement in the newspapers, requesting\r\norphans answering annexed description to apply at the Bower on a certain\r\nday; but Mr Boffin wisely apprehending obstruction of the neighbouring\r\nthoroughfares by orphan swarms, this course was negatived. Mrs Boffin\r\nnext suggested application to their clergyman for a likely orphan. Mr\r\nBoffin thinking better of this scheme, they resolved to call upon the\r\nreverend gentleman at once, and to take the same opportunity of making\r\nacquaintance with Miss Bella Wilfer. In order that these visits might be\r\nvisits of state, Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s equipage was ordered out.\r\n\r\nThis consisted of a long hammer-headed old horse, formerly used in the\r\nbusiness, attached to a four-wheeled chaise of the same period, which\r\nhad long been exclusively used by the Harmony Jail poultry as the\r\nfavourite laying-place of several discreet hens. An unwonted application\r\nof corn to the horse, and of paint and varnish to the carriage, when\r\nboth fell in as a part of the Boffin legacy, had made what Mr Boffin\r\nconsidered a neat turn-out of the whole; and a driver being added, in\r\nthe person of a long hammer-headed young man who was a very good match\r\nfor the horse, left nothing to be desired. He, too, had been formerly\r\nused in the business, but was now entombed by an honest jobbing tailor\r\nof the district in a perfect Sepulchre of coat and gaiters, sealed with\r\nponderous buttons.\r\n\r\nBehind this domestic, Mr and Mrs Boffin took their seats in the back\r\ncompartment of the vehicle: which was sufficiently commodious, but had\r\nan undignified and alarming tendency, in getting over a rough crossing,\r\nto hiccup itself away from the front compartment. On their being\r\ndescried emerging from the gates of the Bower, the neighbourhood turned\r\nout at door and window to salute the Boffins. Among those who were ever\r\nand again left behind, staring after the equipage, were many youthful\r\nspirits, who hailed it in stentorian tones with such congratulations as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nod-dy Bof-fin!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Bof-fin\xe2\x80\x99s mon-ey!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Down with the dust, Bof-fin!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nother similar compliments. These, the hammer-headed young man took in\r\nsuch ill part that he often impaired the majesty of the progress by\r\npulling up short, and making as though he would alight to exterminate\r\nthe offenders; a purpose from which he only allowed himself to be\r\ndissuaded after long and lively arguments with his employers.\r\n\r\nAt length the Bower district was left behind, and the peaceful dwelling\r\nof the Reverend Frank Milvey was gained. The Reverend Frank Milvey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabode was a very modest abode, because his income was a very modest\r\nincome. He was officially accessible to every blundering old woman who\r\nhad incoherence to bestow upon him, and readily received the Boffins.\r\nHe was quite a young man, expensively educated and wretchedly paid, with\r\nquite a young wife and half a dozen quite young children. He was under\r\nthe necessity of teaching and translating from the classics, to eke out\r\nhis scanty means, yet was generally expected to have more time to spare\r\nthan the idlest person in the parish, and more money than the richest.\r\nHe accepted the needless inequalities and inconsistencies of his life,\r\nwith a kind of conventional submission that was almost slavish; and any\r\ndaring layman who would have adjusted such burdens as his, more decently\r\nand graciously, would have had small help from him.\r\n\r\nWith a ready patient face and manner, and yet with a latent smile that\r\nshowed a quick enough observation of Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s dress, Mr Milvey, in\r\nhis little book-room--charged with sounds and cries as though the six\r\nchildren above were coming down through the ceiling, and the roasting\r\nleg of mutton below were coming up through the floor--listened to Mrs\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s statement of her want of an orphan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey, \xe2\x80\x98that you have never had a child of your own,\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, like the Kings and Queens in the Fairy Tales, I suppose you have\r\nwished for one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a general way, yes.\r\n\r\nMr Milvey smiled again, as he remarked to himself \xe2\x80\x98Those kings and\r\nqueens were always wishing for children.\xe2\x80\x99 It occurring to him, perhaps,\r\nthat if they had been Curates, their wishes might have tended in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued, \xe2\x80\x98we had better take Mrs Milvey into our Council.\r\nShe is indispensable to me. If you please, I\xe2\x80\x99ll call her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, Mr Milvey called, \xe2\x80\x98Margaretta, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 and Mrs Milvey came down.\r\nA pretty, bright little woman, something worn by anxiety, who had\r\nrepressed many pretty tastes and bright fancies, and substituted in\r\ntheir stead, schools, soup, flannel, coals, and all the week-day cares\r\nand Sunday coughs of a large population, young and old. As gallantly had\r\nMr Milvey repressed much in himself that naturally belonged to his old\r\nstudies and old fellow-students, and taken up among the poor and their\r\nchildren with the hard crumbs of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr and Mrs Boffin, my dear, whose good fortune you have heard of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Milvey, with the most unaffected grace in the world, congratulated\r\nthem, and was glad to see them. Yet her engaging face, being an open as\r\nwell as a perceptive one, was not without her husband\xe2\x80\x99s latent smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Boffin wishes to adopt a little boy, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Milvey, looking rather alarmed, her husband added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An orphan, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey, reassured for her own little boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I was thinking, Margaretta, that perhaps old Mrs Goody\xe2\x80\x99s grandchild\r\nmight answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my DEAR Frank! I DON\xe2\x80\x99T think that would do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh NO!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe smiling Mrs Boffin, feeling it incumbent on her to take part in the\r\nconversation, and being charmed with the emphatic little wife and her\r\nready interest, here offered her acknowledgments and inquired what there\r\nwas against him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I DON\xe2\x80\x99T think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey, glancing at the Reverend Frank, \xe2\x80\x98--and\r\nI believe my husband will agree with me when he considers it again--that\r\nyou could possibly keep that orphan clean from snuff. Because his\r\ngrandmother takes so MANY ounces, and drops it over him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he would not be living with his grandmother then, Margaretta,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr Milvey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Frank, but it would be impossible to keep her from Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse; and the MORE there was to eat and drink there, the oftener she\r\nwould go. And she IS an inconvenient woman. I HOPE it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncharitable\r\nto remember that last Christmas Eve she drank eleven cups of tea, and\r\ngrumbled all the time. And she is NOT a grateful woman, Frank. You\r\nrecollect her addressing a crowd outside this house, about her wrongs,\r\nwhen, one night after we had gone to bed, she brought back the petticoat\r\nof new flannel that had been given her, because it was too short.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would do. Would\r\nlittle Harrison--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, FRANK!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated his emphatic wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has no grandmother, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, but I DON\xe2\x80\x99T think Mrs Boffin would like an orphan who squints so\r\nMUCH.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey, becoming haggard with perplexity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If a little girl would do--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my DEAR Frank, Mrs Boffin wants a boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey. \xe2\x80\x98Tom Bocker is a nice boy\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(thoughtfully).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I DOUBT, Frank,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Milvey hinted, after a little hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nMrs Boffin wants an orphan QUITE nineteen, who drives a cart and waters\r\nthe roads.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Milvey referred the point to Mrs Boffin in a look; on that smiling\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s shaking her black velvet bonnet and bows, he remarked, in lower\r\nspirits, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s true again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, concerned at giving so much trouble, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nif I had known you would have taken so much pains, sir--and you too, ma\xe2\x80\x99\r\nam--I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would have come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98PRAY don\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mrs Milvey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr Milvey, \xe2\x80\x98because we are so much\r\nobliged to you for giving us the preference.\xe2\x80\x99 Which Mrs Milvey\r\nconfirmed; and really the kind, conscientious couple spoke, as if they\r\nkept some profitable orphan warehouse and were personally patronized.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it is a responsible trust,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr Milvey, \xe2\x80\x98and difficult to\r\ndischarge. At the same time, we are naturally very unwilling to lose the\r\nchance you so kindly give us, and if you could afford us a day or two\r\nto look about us,--you know, Margaretta, we might carefully examine the\r\nworkhouse, and the Infant School, and your District.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be SURE!\xe2\x80\x99 said the emphatic little wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have orphans, I know,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Milvey, quite with the air as if\r\nhe might have added, \xe2\x80\x98in stock,\xe2\x80\x99 and quite as anxiously as if there were\r\ngreat competition in the business and he were afraid of losing an order,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98over at the clay-pits; but they are employed by relations or friends,\r\nand I am afraid it would come at last to a transaction in the way of\r\nbarter. And even if you exchanged blankets for the child--or books\r\nand firing--it would be impossible to prevent their being turned into\r\nliquor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it was resolved that Mr and Mrs Milvey should search for\r\nan orphan likely to suit, and as free as possible from the foregoing\r\nobjections, and should communicate again with Mrs Boffin. Then, Mr\r\nBoffin took the liberty of mentioning to Mr Milvey that if Mr Milvey\r\nwould do him the kindness to be perpetually his banker to the extent\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98a twenty-pound note or so,\xe2\x80\x99 to be expended without any reference\r\nto him, he would be heartily obliged. At this, both Mr Milvey and Mrs\r\nMilvey were quite as much pleased as if they had no wants of their own,\r\nbut only knew what poverty was, in the persons of other people; and\r\nso the interview terminated with satisfaction and good opinion on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, as they resumed their seats behind the\r\nhammer-headed horse and man: \xe2\x80\x98having made a very agreeable visit there,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll try Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt appeared, on their drawing up at the family gate, that to try\r\nWilfer\xe2\x80\x99s was a thing more easily projected than done, on account of the\r\nextreme difficulty of getting into that establishment; three pulls\r\nat the bell producing no external result; though each was attended\r\nby audible sounds of scampering and rushing within. At the fourth\r\ntug--vindictively administered by the hammer-headed young man--Miss\r\nLavinia appeared, emerging from the house in an accidental manner, with\r\na bonnet and parasol, as designing to take a contemplative walk. The\r\nyoung lady was astonished to find visitors at the gate, and expressed\r\nher feelings in appropriate action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr and Mrs Boffin!\xe2\x80\x99 growled the hammer-headed young man through\r\nthe bars of the gate, and at the same time shaking it, as if he were on\r\nview in a Menagerie; \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99ve been here half an hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who did you say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Lavinia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr and Mrs BOFFIN\xe2\x80\x99 returned the young man, rising into a roar.\r\n\r\nMiss Lavinia tripped up the steps to the house-door, tripped down the\r\nsteps with the key, tripped across the little garden, and opened the\r\ngate. \xe2\x80\x98Please to walk in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Lavinia, haughtily. \xe2\x80\x98Our servant is\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin complying, and pausing in the little hall until Miss\r\nLavinia came up to show them where to go next, perceived three pairs of\r\nlistening legs upon the stairs above. Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s legs, Miss Bella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegs, Mr George Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr and Mrs Boffin, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia, in a warning voice. Strained\r\nattention on the part of Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s legs, of Miss Bella\xe2\x80\x99s legs, of Mr\r\nGeorge Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99ll step this way--down these stairs--I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Ma know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nExcited flight of Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s legs, of Miss Bella\xe2\x80\x99s legs, of Mr George\r\nSampson\xe2\x80\x99s legs.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting some quarter of an hour alone in the family sitting-room,\r\nwhich presented traces of having been so hastily arranged after a meal,\r\nthat one might have doubted whether it was made tidy for visitors,\r\nor cleared for blindman\xe2\x80\x99s buff, Mr and Mrs Boffin became aware of the\r\nentrance of Mrs Wilfer, majestically faint, and with a condescending\r\nstitch in her side: which was her company manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, after the first salutations, and as soon\r\nas she had adjusted the handkerchief under her chin, and waved her\r\ngloved hands, \xe2\x80\x98to what am I indebted for this honour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To make short of it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps you may be\r\nacquainted with the names of me and Mrs Boffin, as having come into a\r\ncertain property.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, with a dignified bend of her\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x98of such being the case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I dare say, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin, while Mrs Boffin added\r\nconfirmatory nods and smiles, \xe2\x80\x98you are not very much inclined to take\r\nkindly to us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twere unjust to visit upon Mr and Mrs\r\nBoffin, a calamity which was doubtless a dispensation.\xe2\x80\x99 These words\r\nwere rendered the more effective by a serenely heroic expression of\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s fairly meant, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the honest Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98Mrs\r\nBoffin and me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, are plain people, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pretend\r\nto anything, nor yet to go round and round at anything because there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways a straight way to everything. Consequently, we make this call\r\nto say, that we shall be glad to have the honour and pleasure of your\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance, and that we shall be rejoiced if your daughter\r\nwill come to consider our house in the light of her home equally with\r\nthis. In short, we want to cheer your daughter, and to give her\r\nthe opportunity of sharing such pleasures as we are a going to take\r\nourselves. We want to brisk her up, and brisk her about, and give her a\r\nchange.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x99 said the open-hearted Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Lor! Let\xe2\x80\x99s be\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer bent her head in a distant manner to her lady visitor, and\r\nwith majestic monotony replied to the gentleman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me. I have several daughters. Which of my daughters am I to\r\nunderstand is thus favoured by the kind intentions of Mr Boffin and his\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x99 the ever-smiling Mrs Boffin put in. \xe2\x80\x98Naturally, Miss\r\nBella, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh-h!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, with a severely unconvinced look. \xe2\x80\x98My daughter\r\nBella is accessible and shall speak for herself.\xe2\x80\x99 Then opening the door\r\na little way, simultaneously with a sound of scuttling outside it,\r\nthe good lady made the proclamation, \xe2\x80\x98Send Miss Bella to me!\xe2\x80\x99 which\r\nproclamation, though grandly formal, and one might almost say heraldic,\r\nto hear, was in fact enunciated with her maternal eyes reproachfully\r\nglaring on that young lady in the flesh--and in so much of it that she\r\nwas retiring with difficulty into the small closet under the stairs,\r\napprehensive of the emergence of Mr and Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The avocations of R. W., my husband,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer explained, on resuming\r\nher seat, \xe2\x80\x98keep him fully engaged in the City at this time of the day,\r\nor he would have had the honour of participating in your reception\r\nbeneath our humble roof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very pleasant premises!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, correcting him, \xe2\x80\x98it is the abode\r\nof conscious though independent Poverty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFinding it rather difficult to pursue the conversation down this road,\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin sat staring at mid-air, and Mrs Wilfer sat silently\r\ngiving them to understand that every breath she drew required to be\r\ndrawn with a self-denial rarely paralleled in history, until Miss Bella\r\nappeared: whom Mrs Wilfer presented, and to whom she explained the\r\npurpose of the visitors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much obliged to you, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Bella, coldly shaking\r\nher curls, \xe2\x80\x98but I doubt if I have the inclination to go out at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bella!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer admonished her; \xe2\x80\x98Bella, you must conquer this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, do what your Ma says, and conquer it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mrs Boffin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because we shall be so glad to have you, and because you are much too\r\npretty to keep yourself shut up.\xe2\x80\x99 With that, the pleasant creature gave\r\nher a kiss, and patted her on her dimpled shoulders; Mrs Wilfer sitting\r\nstiffly by, like a functionary presiding over an interview previous to\r\nan execution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are going to move into a nice house,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, who was woman\r\nenough to compromise Mr Boffin on that point, when he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t very well\r\ncontest it; \xe2\x80\x98and we are going to set up a nice carriage, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\neverywhere and see everything. And you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 seating Bella beside\r\nher, and patting her hand, \xe2\x80\x98you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t feel a dislike to us to begin\r\nwith, because we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, you know, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the natural tendency of youth to yield to candour and sweet temper,\r\nMiss Bella was so touched by the simplicity of this address that she\r\nfrankly returned Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s kiss. Not at all to the satisfaction\r\nof that good woman of the world, her mother, who sought to hold the\r\nadvantageous ground of obliging the Boffins instead of being obliged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My youngest daughter, Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, glad to make a\r\ndiversion, as that young lady reappeared. \xe2\x80\x98Mr George Sampson, a friend\r\nof the family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe friend of the family was in that stage of tender passion which bound\r\nhim to regard everybody else as the foe of the family. He put the round\r\nhead of his cane in his mouth, like a stopper, when he sat down. As if\r\nhe felt himself full to the throat with affronting sentiments. And he\r\neyed the Boffins with implacable eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you like to bring your sister with you when you come to stay with\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98of course we shall be glad. The better you please\r\nyourself, Miss Bella, the better you\xe2\x80\x99ll please us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my consent is of no consequence at all, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss\r\nLavinia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lavvy,\xe2\x80\x99 said her sister, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98have the goodness to be seen\r\nand not heard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the sharp Lavinia. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child, to be taken\r\nnotice of by strangers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ARE a child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not a child, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be taken notice of. \xe2\x80\x9cBring your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lavinia!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Hold! I will not allow you to utter in my\r\npresence the absurd suspicion that any strangers--I care not what their\r\nnames--can patronize my child. Do you dare to suppose, you ridiculous\r\ngirl, that Mr and Mrs Boffin would enter these doors upon a patronizing\r\nerrand; or, if they did, would remain within them, only for one single\r\ninstant, while your mother had the strength yet remaining in her vital\r\nframe to request them to depart? You little know your mother if you\r\npresume to think so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine,\xe2\x80\x99 Lavinia began to grumble, when Mrs Wilfer\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold! I will not allow this. Do you not know what is due to guests?\r\nDo you not comprehend that in presuming to hint that this lady and\r\ngentleman could have any idea of patronizing any member of your\r\nfamily--I care not which--you accuse them of an impertinence little less\r\nthan insane?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind me and Mrs Boffin, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, smilingly: \xe2\x80\x98we\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, but I do,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer.\r\n\r\nMiss Lavinia laughed a short laugh as she muttered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I require my audacious child,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Mrs Wilfer, with a\r\nwithering look at her youngest, on whom it had not the slightest effect,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to please to be just to her sister Bella; to remember that her sister\r\nBella is much sought after; and that when her sister Bella accepts an\r\nattention, she considers herself to be conferring qui-i-ite as much\r\nhonour,\xe2\x80\x99--this with an indignant shiver,--\xe2\x80\x98as she receives.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, here Miss Bella repudiated, and said quietly, \xe2\x80\x98I can speak for\r\nmyself; you know, ma. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t bring ME in, please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it\xe2\x80\x99s all very well aiming at others through convenient me,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe irrepressible Lavinia, spitefully; \xe2\x80\x98but I should like to ask George\r\nSampson what he says to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Sampson,\xe2\x80\x99 proclaimed Mrs Wilfer, seeing that young gentleman take\r\nhis stopper out, and so darkly fixing him with her eyes as that he put\r\nit in again: \xe2\x80\x98Mr Sampson, as a friend of this family and a frequenter of\r\nthis house, is, I am persuaded, far too well-bred to interpose on such\r\nan invitation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis exaltation of the young gentleman moved the conscientious Mrs\r\nBoffin to repentance for having done him an injustice in her mind, and\r\nconsequently to saying that she and Mr Boffin would at any time be glad\r\nto see him; an attention which he handsomely acknowledged by replying,\r\nwith his stopper unremoved, \xe2\x80\x98Much obliged to you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m always\r\nengaged, day and night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, Bella compensating for all drawbacks by responding to the\r\nadvances of the Boffins in an engaging way, that easy pair were on the\r\nwhole well satisfied, and proposed to the said Bella that as soon as\r\nthey should be in a condition to receive her in a manner suitable to\r\ntheir desires, Mrs Boffin should return with notice of the fact. This\r\narrangement Mrs Wilfer sanctioned with a stately inclination of her\r\nhead and wave of her gloves, as who should say, \xe2\x80\x98Your demerits shall be\r\noverlooked, and you shall be mercifully gratified, poor people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By-the-bye, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, turning back as he was going, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nhave a lodger?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer answered, qualifying the low expression,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98undoubtedly occupies our first floor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I may call him Our Mutual Friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98What sort of a\r\nfellow IS Our Mutual Friend, now? Do you like him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith is very punctual, very quiet, a very eligible inmate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin explained, \xe2\x80\x98you must know that I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly\r\nwell acquainted with Our Mutual Friend, for I have only seen him once.\r\nYou give a good account of him. Is he at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith is at home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer; \xe2\x80\x98indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 pointing through\r\nthe window, \xe2\x80\x98there he stands at the garden gate. Waiting for you,\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Saw me come in, maybe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella had closely attended to this short dialogue. Accompanying Mrs\r\nBoffin to the gate, she as closely watched what followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are you, sir, how are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98This is Mrs Boffin. Mr\r\nRokesmith, that I told you of; my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave him good day, and he bestirred himself and helped her to her\r\nseat, and the like, with a ready hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye for the present, Miss Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, calling out a\r\nhearty parting. \xe2\x80\x98We shall meet again soon! And then I hope I shall have\r\nmy little John Harmon to show you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith, who was at the wheel adjusting the skirts of her dress,\r\nsuddenly looked behind him, and around him, and then looked up at her,\r\nwith a face so pale that Mrs Boffin cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious!\xe2\x80\x99 And after a moment, \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you show her the Dead?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only an adopted child. One I have told her of. One I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ngive the name to!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You took me by surprise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Rokesmith, \xe2\x80\x98and it sounded like an\r\nomen, that you should speak of showing the Dead to one so young and\r\nblooming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, Bella suspected by this time that Mr Rokesmith admired her. Whether\r\nthe knowledge (for it was rather that than suspicion) caused her to\r\nincline to him a little more, or a little less, than she had done at\r\nfirst; whether it rendered her eager to find out more about him, because\r\nshe sought to establish reason for her distrust, or because she sought\r\nto free him from it; was as yet dark to her own heart. But at most\r\ntimes he occupied a great amount of her attention, and she had set her\r\nattention closely on this incident.\r\n\r\nThat he knew it as well as she, she knew as well as he, when they were\r\nleft together standing on the path by the garden gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those are worthy people, Miss Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know them well?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, reproaching her, and she coloured, reproaching herself--both,\r\nwith the knowledge that she had meant to entrap him into an answer not\r\ntrue--when he said \xe2\x80\x98I know OF them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, he told us he had seen you but once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, I supposed he did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella was nervous now, and would have been glad to recall her question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You thought it strange that, feeling much interested in you, I should\r\nstart at what sounded like a proposal to bring you into contact with the\r\nmurdered man who lies in his grave. I might have known--of course in a\r\nmoment should have known--that it could not have that meaning. But my\r\ninterest remains.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRe-entering the family-room in a meditative state, Miss Bella was\r\nreceived by the irrepressible Lavinia with:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, Bella! At last I hope you have got your wishes realized--by your\r\nBoffins. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be rich enough now--with your Boffins. You can have as\r\nmuch flirting as you like--at your Boffins. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t take ME to\r\nyour Boffins, I can tell you--you and your Boffins too!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Mr George Sampson, moodily pulling his stopper out, \xe2\x80\x98Miss\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Boffin comes any more of his nonsense to ME, I only wish him\r\nto understand, as betwixt man and man, that he does it at his per--\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwas going to say peril; but Miss Lavinia, having no confidence in his\r\nmental powers, and feeling his oration to have no definite application\r\nto any circumstances, jerked his stopper in again, with a sharpness that\r\nmade his eyes water.\r\n\r\nAnd now the worthy Mrs Wilfer, having used her youngest daughter as a\r\nlay-figure for the edification of these Boffins, became bland to her,\r\nand proceeded to develop her last instance of force of character,\r\nwhich was still in reserve. This was, to illuminate the family with her\r\nremarkable powers as a physiognomist; powers that terrified R. W. when\r\never let loose, as being always fraught with gloom and evil which no\r\ninferior prescience was aware of. And this Mrs Wilfer now did, be it\r\nobserved, in jealousy of these Boffins, in the very same moments when\r\nshe was already reflecting how she would flourish these very same\r\nBoffins and the state they kept, over the heads of her Boffinless\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of their manners,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98I say nothing. Of their\r\nappearance, I say nothing. Of the disinterestedness of their intentions\r\ntowards Bella, I say nothing. But the craft, the secrecy, the dark\r\ndeep underhanded plotting, written in Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, make me\r\nshudder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs an incontrovertible proof that those baleful attributes were all\r\nthere, Mrs Wilfer shuddered on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nA MARRIAGE CONTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is excitement in the Veneering mansion. The mature young lady is\r\ngoing to be married (powder and all) to the mature young gentleman, and\r\nshe is to be married from the Veneering house, and the Veneerings are to\r\ngive the breakfast. The Analytical, who objects as a matter of principle\r\nto everything that occurs on the premises, necessarily objects to the\r\nmatch; but his consent has been dispensed with, and a spring-van is\r\ndelivering its load of greenhouse plants at the door, in order that\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s feast may be crowned with flowers.\r\n\r\nThe mature young lady is a lady of property. The mature young gentleman\r\nis a gentleman of property. He invests his property. He goes, in\r\na condescending amateurish way, into the City, attends meetings of\r\nDirectors, and has to do with traffic in Shares. As is well known to the\r\nwise in their generation, traffic in Shares is the one thing to have to\r\ndo with in this world. Have no antecedents, no established character, no\r\ncultivation, no ideas, no manners; have Shares. Have Shares enough to\r\nbe on Boards of Direction in capital letters, oscillate on mysterious\r\nbusiness between London and Paris, and be great. Where does he come\r\nfrom? Shares. Where is he going to? Shares. What are his tastes? Shares.\r\nHas he any principles? Shares. What squeezes him into Parliament?\r\nShares. Perhaps he never of himself achieved success in anything, never\r\noriginated anything, never produced anything? Sufficient answer to all;\r\nShares. O mighty Shares! To set those blaring images so high, and to\r\ncause us smaller vermin, as under the influence of henbane or opium, to\r\ncry out, night and day, \xe2\x80\x98Relieve us of our money, scatter it for us, buy\r\nus and sell us, ruin us, only we beseech ye take rank among the powers\r\nof the earth, and fatten on us\xe2\x80\x99!\r\n\r\nWhile the Loves and Graces have been preparing this torch for Hymen,\r\nwhich is to be kindled to-morrow, Mr Twemlow has suffered much in his\r\nmind. It would seem that both the mature young lady and the mature young\r\ngentleman must indubitably be Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s oldest friends. Wards of his,\r\nperhaps? Yet that can scarcely be, for they are older than himself.\r\nVeneering has been in their confidence throughout, and has done much to\r\nlure them to the altar. He has mentioned to Twemlow how he said to\r\nMrs Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98Anastatia, this must be a match.\xe2\x80\x99 He has mentioned to\r\nTwemlow how he regards Sophronia Akershem (the mature young lady) in the\r\nlight of a sister, and Alfred Lammle (the mature young gentleman) in the\r\nlight of a brother. Twemlow has asked him whether he went to school as\r\na junior with Alfred? He has answered, \xe2\x80\x98Not exactly.\xe2\x80\x99 Whether Sophronia\r\nwas adopted by his mother? He has answered, \xe2\x80\x98Not precisely so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTwemlow\xe2\x80\x99s hand has gone to his forehead with a lost air.\r\n\r\nBut, two or three weeks ago, Twemlow, sitting over his newspaper,\r\nand over his dry-toast and weak tea, and over the stable-yard in Duke\r\nStreet, St James\xe2\x80\x99s, received a highly-perfumed cocked-hat and monogram\r\nfrom Mrs Veneering, entreating her dearest Mr T., if not particularly\r\nengaged that day, to come like a charming soul and make a fourth at\r\ndinner with dear Mr Podsnap, for the discussion of an interesting family\r\ntopic; the last three words doubly underlined and pointed with a note\r\nof admiration. And Twemlow replying, \xe2\x80\x98Not engaged, and more than\r\ndelighted,\xe2\x80\x99 goes, and this takes place:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Twemlow,\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98your ready response to Anastatia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunceremonious invitation is truly kind, and like an old, old friend. You\r\nknow our dear friend Podsnap?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow ought to know the dear friend Podsnap who covered him with so\r\nmuch confusion, and he says he does know him, and Podsnap reciprocates.\r\nApparently, Podsnap has been so wrought upon in a short time, as to\r\nbelieve that he has been intimate in the house many, many, many years.\r\nIn the friendliest manner he is making himself quite at home with his\r\nback to the fire, executing a statuette of the Colossus at Rhodes.\r\nTwemlow has before noticed in his feeble way how soon the Veneering\r\nguests become infected with the Veneering fiction. Not, however, that he\r\nhas the least notion of its being his own case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our friends, Alfred and Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues Veneering the veiled\r\nprophet: \xe2\x80\x98our friends Alfred and Sophronia, you will be glad to hear, my\r\ndear fellows, are going to be married. As my wife and I make it a family\r\naffair the entire direction of which we take upon ourselves, of course\r\nour first step is to communicate the fact to our family friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Twemlow, with his eyes on Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98then there are only\r\ntwo of us, and he\xe2\x80\x99s the other.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did hope,\xe2\x80\x99 Veneering goes on, \xe2\x80\x98to have had Lady Tippins to meet you;\r\nbut she is always in request, and is unfortunately engaged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Twemlow, with his eyes wandering, \xe2\x80\x98then there are three of\r\nus, and SHE\xe2\x80\x99S the other.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mortimer Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 resumes Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98whom you both know, is out of\r\ntown; but he writes, in his whimsical manner, that as we ask him to be\r\nbridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s best man when the ceremony takes place, he will not refuse,\r\nthough he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see what he has to do with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Twemlow, with his eyes rolling, \xe2\x80\x98then there are four of\r\nus, and HE\xe2\x80\x99S the other.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boots and Brewer,\xe2\x80\x99 observes Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98whom you also know, I have not\r\nasked to-day; but I reserve them for the occasion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Twemlow, with his eyes shut, \xe2\x80\x98there are si--\xe2\x80\x99 But here\r\ncollapses and does not completely recover until dinner is over and the\r\nAnalytical has been requested to withdraw.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We now come,\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98to the point, the real point, of our\r\nlittle family consultation. Sophronia, having lost both father and\r\nmother, has no one to give her away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give her away yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Podsnap, no. For three reasons. Firstly, because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake so much upon myself when I have respected family friends to\r\nremember. Secondly, because I am not so vain as to think that I look\r\nthe part. Thirdly, because Anastatia is a little superstitious on the\r\nsubject and feels averse to my giving away anybody until baby is old\r\nenough to be married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would happen if he did?\xe2\x80\x99 Podsnap inquires of Mrs Veneering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mr Podsnap, it\xe2\x80\x99s very foolish I know, but I have an instinctive\r\npresentiment that if Hamilton gave away anybody else first, he would\r\nnever give away baby.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus Mrs Veneering; with her open hands pressed\r\ntogether, and each of her eight aquiline fingers looking so very like\r\nher one aquiline nose that the bran-new jewels on them seem necessary\r\nfor distinction\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Podsnap,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98there IS a tried friend of\r\nour family who, I think and hope you will agree with me, Podsnap, is\r\nthe friend on whom this agreeable duty almost naturally devolves. That\r\nfriend,\xe2\x80\x99 saying the words as if the company were about a hundred and\r\nfifty in number, \xe2\x80\x98is now among us. That friend is Twemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly!\xe2\x80\x99 from Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That friend,\xe2\x80\x99 Veneering repeats with greater firmness, \xe2\x80\x98is our dear\r\ngood Twemlow. And I cannot sufficiently express to you, my dear Podsnap,\r\nthe pleasure I feel in having this opinion of mine and Anastatia\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\nreadily confirmed by you, that other equally familiar and tried friend\r\nwho stands in the proud position--I mean who proudly stands in the\r\nposition--or I ought rather to say, who places Anastatia and myself in\r\nthe proud position of himself standing in the simple position--of baby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngodfather.\xe2\x80\x99 And, indeed, Veneering is much relieved in mind to find that\r\nPodsnap betrays no jealousy of Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s elevation.\r\n\r\nSo, it has come to pass that the spring-van is strewing flowers on\r\nthe rosy hours and on the staircase, and that Twemlow is surveying the\r\nground on which he is to play his distinguished part to-morrow. He has\r\nalready been to the church, and taken note of the various impediments in\r\nthe aisle, under the auspices of an extremely dreary widow who opens the\r\npews, and whose left hand appears to be in a state of acute rheumatism,\r\nbut is in fact voluntarily doubled up to act as a money-box.\r\n\r\nAnd now Veneering shoots out of the Study wherein he is accustomed,\r\nwhen contemplative, to give his mind to the carving and gilding of\r\nthe Pilgrims going to Canterbury, in order to show Twemlow the little\r\nflourish he has prepared for the trumpets of fashion, describing how\r\nthat on the seventeenth instant, at St James\xe2\x80\x99s Church, the Reverend\r\nBlank Blank, assisted by the Reverend Dash Dash, united in the bonds of\r\nmatrimony, Alfred Lammle Esquire, of Sackville Street, Piccadilly,\r\nto Sophronia, only daughter of the late Horatio Akershem, Esquire,\r\nof Yorkshire. Also how the fair bride was married from the house of\r\nHamilton Veneering, Esquire, of Stucconia, and was given away by Melvin\r\nTwemlow, Esquire, of Duke Street, St James\xe2\x80\x99s, second cousin to Lord\r\nSnigsworth, of Snigsworthy Park. While perusing which composition,\r\nTwemlow makes some opaque approach to perceiving that if the Reverend\r\nBlank Blank and the Reverend Dash Dash fail, after this introduction, to\r\nbecome enrolled in the list of Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s dearest and oldest friends,\r\nthey will have none but themselves to thank for it.\r\n\r\nAfter which, appears Sophronia (whom Twemlow has seen twice in his\r\nlifetime), to thank Twemlow for counterfeiting the late Horatio Akershem\r\nEsquire, broadly of Yorkshire. And after her, appears Alfred (whom\r\nTwemlow has seen once in his lifetime), to do the same and to make a\r\npasty sort of glitter, as if he were constructed for candle-light only,\r\nand had been let out into daylight by some grand mistake. And after\r\nthat, comes Mrs Veneering, in a pervadingly aquiline state of figure,\r\nand with transparent little knobs on her temper, like the little\r\ntransparent knob on the bridge of her nose, \xe2\x80\x98Worn out by worry and\r\nexcitement,\xe2\x80\x99 as she tells her dear Mr Twemlow, and reluctantly revived\r\nwith curacoa by the Analytical. And after that, the bridesmaids begin\r\nto come by rail-road from various parts of the country, and to come like\r\nadorable recruits enlisted by a sergeant not present; for, on arriving\r\nat the Veneering depot, they are in a barrack of strangers.\r\n\r\nSo, Twemlow goes home to Duke Street, St James\xe2\x80\x99s, to take a plate of\r\nmutton broth with a chop in it, and a look at the marriage-service, in\r\norder that he may cut in at the right place to-morrow; and he is low,\r\nand feels it dull over the livery stable-yard, and is distinctly aware\r\nof a dint in his heart, made by the most adorable of the adorable\r\nbridesmaids. For, the poor little harmless gentleman once had his fancy,\r\nlike the rest of us, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer (as she often does not),\r\nand he thinks the adorable bridesmaid is like the fancy as she was then\r\n(which she is not at all), and that if the fancy had not married some\r\none else for money, but had married him for love, he and she would\r\nhave been happy (which they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been), and that she has a\r\ntenderness for him still (whereas her toughness is a proverb). Brooding\r\nover the fire, with his dried little head in his dried little hands,\r\nand his dried little elbows on his dried little knees, Twemlow is\r\nmelancholy. \xe2\x80\x98No Adorable to bear me company here!\xe2\x80\x99 thinks he. \xe2\x80\x98No\r\nAdorable at the club! A waste, a waste, a waste, my Twemlow!\xe2\x80\x99 And so\r\ndrops asleep, and has galvanic starts all over him.\r\n\r\nBetimes next morning, that horrible old Lady Tippins (relict of the late\r\nSir Thomas Tippins, knighted in mistake for somebody else by His\r\nMajesty King George the Third, who, while performing the ceremony, was\r\ngraciously pleased to observe, \xe2\x80\x98What, what, what? Who, who, who?\r\nWhy, why, why?\xe2\x80\x99) begins to be dyed and varnished for the interesting\r\noccasion. She has a reputation for giving smart accounts of things, and\r\nshe must be at these people\xe2\x80\x99s early, my dear, to lose nothing of the\r\nfun. Whereabout in the bonnet and drapery announced by her name, any\r\nfragment of the real woman may be concealed, is perhaps known to her\r\nmaid; but you could easily buy all you see of her, in Bond Street; or\r\nyou might scalp her, and peel her, and scrape her, and make two Lady\r\nTippinses out of her, and yet not penetrate to the genuine article. She\r\nhas a large gold eye-glass, has Lady Tippins, to survey the proceedings\r\nwith. If she had one in each eye, it might keep that other drooping\r\nlid up, and look more uniform. But perennial youth is in her artificial\r\nflowers, and her list of lovers is full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mortimer, you wretch,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lady Tippins, turning the eyeglass about\r\nand about, \xe2\x80\x98where is your charge, the bridegroom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give you my honour,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miserable! Is that the way you do your duty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beyond an impression that he is to sit upon my knee and be seconded\r\nat some point of the solemnities, like a principal at a prizefight, I\r\nassure you I have no notion what my duty is,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Mortimer.\r\n\r\nEugene is also in attendance, with a pervading air upon him of having\r\npresupposed the ceremony to be a funeral, and of being disappointed. The\r\nscene is the Vestry-room of St James\xe2\x80\x99s Church, with a number of leathery\r\nold registers on shelves, that might be bound in Lady Tippinses.\r\n\r\nBut, hark! A carriage at the gate, and Mortimer\xe2\x80\x99s man arrives, looking\r\nrather like a spurious Mephistopheles and an unacknowledged member\r\nof that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s family. Whom Lady Tippins, surveying through her\r\neye-glass, considers a fine man, and quite a catch; and of whom Mortimer\r\nremarks, in the lowest spirits, as he approaches, \xe2\x80\x98I believe this is my\r\nfellow, confound him!\xe2\x80\x99 More carriages at the gate, and lo the rest of\r\nthe characters. Whom Lady Tippins, standing on a cushion, surveying\r\nthrough the eye-glass, thus checks off. \xe2\x80\x98Bride; five-and-forty if a\r\nday, thirty shillings a yard, veil fifteen pound, pocket-handkerchief\r\na present. Bridesmaids; kept down for fear of outshining bride,\r\nconsequently not girls, twelve and sixpence a yard, Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s flowers,\r\nsnub-nosed one rather pretty but too conscious of her stockings, bonnets\r\nthree pound ten. Twemlow; blessed release for the dear man if she really\r\nwas his daughter, nervous even under the pretence that she is, well he\r\nmay be. Mrs Veneering; never saw such velvet, say two thousand pounds\r\nas she stands, absolute jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s window, father must have been a\r\npawnbroker, or how could these people do it? Attendant unknowns; pokey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCeremony performed, register signed, Lady Tippins escorted out of sacred\r\nedifice by Veneering, carriages rolling back to Stucconia, servants\r\nwith favours and flowers, Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s house reached, drawing-rooms most\r\nmagnificent. Here, the Podsnaps await the happy party; Mr Podsnap, with\r\nhis hair-brushes made the most of; that imperial rocking-horse, Mrs\r\nPodsnap, majestically skittish. Here, too, are Boots and Brewer, and\r\nthe two other Buffers; each Buffer with a flower in his button-hole, his\r\nhair curled, and his gloves buttoned on tight, apparently come prepared,\r\nif anything had happened to the bridegroom, to be married instantly.\r\nHere, too, the bride\xe2\x80\x99s aunt and next relation; a widowed female of\r\na Medusa sort, in a stoney cap, glaring petrifaction at her\r\nfellow-creatures. Here, too, the bride\xe2\x80\x99s trustee; an oilcake-fed style\r\nof business-gentleman with mooney spectacles, and an object of much\r\ninterest. Veneering launching himself upon this trustee as his oldest\r\nfriend (which makes seven, Twemlow thought), and confidentially retiring\r\nwith him into the conservatory, it is understood that Veneering is his\r\nco-trustee, and that they are arranging about the fortune. Buffers are\r\neven overheard to whisper Thir-ty Thou-sand Pou-nds! with a smack and a\r\nrelish suggestive of the very finest oysters. Pokey unknowns, amazed\r\nto find how intimately they know Veneering, pluck up spirit, fold\r\ntheir arms, and begin to contradict him before breakfast. What time Mrs\r\nVeneering, carrying baby dressed as a bridesmaid, flits about among\r\nthe company, emitting flashes of many-coloured lightning from diamonds,\r\nemeralds, and rubies.\r\n\r\nThe Analytical, in course of time achieving what he feels to be due to\r\nhimself in bringing to a dignified conclusion several quarrels he has on\r\nhand with the pastrycook\xe2\x80\x99s men, announces breakfast. Dining-room no less\r\nmagnificent than drawing-room; tables superb; all the camels out, and\r\nall laden. Splendid cake, covered with Cupids, silver, and true-lovers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknots. Splendid bracelet, produced by Veneering before going down, and\r\nclasped upon the arm of bride. Yet nobody seems to think much more of\r\nthe Veneerings than if they were a tolerable landlord and landlady\r\ndoing the thing in the way of business at so much a head. The bride and\r\nbridegroom talk and laugh apart, as has always been their manner;\r\nand the Buffers work their way through the dishes with systematic\r\nperseverance, as has always been THEIR manner; and the pokey unknowns\r\nare exceedingly benevolent to one another in invitations to take\r\nglasses of champagne; but Mrs Podsnap, arching her mane and rocking her\r\ngrandest, has a far more deferential audience than Mrs Veneering; and\r\nPodsnap all but does the honours.\r\n\r\nAnother dismal circumstance is, that Veneering, having the captivating\r\nTippins on one side of him and the bride\xe2\x80\x99s aunt on the other, finds\r\nit immensely difficult to keep the peace. For, Medusa, besides\r\nunmistakingly glaring petrifaction at the fascinating Tippins, follows\r\nevery lively remark made by that dear creature, with an audible snort:\r\nwhich may be referable to a chronic cold in the head, but may also be\r\nreferable to indignation and contempt. And this snort being regular in\r\nits reproduction, at length comes to be expected by the company, who\r\nmake embarrassing pauses when it is falling due, and by waiting for it,\r\nrender it more emphatic when it comes. The stoney aunt has likewise an\r\ninjurious way of rejecting all dishes whereof Lady Tippins partakes:\r\nsaying aloud when they are proffered to her, \xe2\x80\x98No, no, no, not for me.\r\nTake it away!\xe2\x80\x99 As with a set purpose of implying a misgiving that if\r\nnourished upon similar meats, she might come to be like that charmer,\r\nwhich would be a fatal consummation. Aware of her enemy, Lady Tippins\r\ntries a youthful sally or two, and tries the eye-glass; but, from the\r\nimpenetrable cap and snorting armour of the stoney aunt all weapons\r\nrebound powerless.\r\n\r\nAnother objectionable circumstance is, that the pokey unknowns support\r\neach other in being unimpressible. They persist in not being frightened\r\nby the gold and silver camels, and they are banded together to defy\r\nthe elaborately chased ice-pails. They even seem to unite in some vague\r\nutterance of the sentiment that the landlord and landlady will make a\r\npretty good profit out of this, and they almost carry themselves\r\nlike customers. Nor is there compensating influence in the adorable\r\nbridesmaids; for, having very little interest in the bride, and none\r\nat all in one another, those lovely beings become, each one of her own\r\naccount, depreciatingly contemplative of the millinery present; while\r\nthe bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s man, exhausted, in the back of his chair, appears to be\r\nimproving the occasion by penitentially contemplating all the wrong he\r\nhas ever done; the difference between him and his friend Eugene, being,\r\nthat the latter, in the back of HIS chair, appears to be contemplating\r\nall the wrong he would like to do--particularly to the present company.\r\n\r\nIn which state of affairs, the usual ceremonies rather droop and flag,\r\nand the splendid cake when cut by the fair hand of the bride has but\r\nan indigestible appearance. However, all the things indispensable to\r\nbe said are said, and all the things indispensable to be done are\r\ndone (including Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s yawning, falling asleep, and waking\r\ninsensible), and there is hurried preparation for the nuptial journey\r\nto the Isle of Wight, and the outer air teems with brass bands and\r\nspectators. In full sight of whom, the malignant star of the Analytical\r\nhas pre-ordained that pain and ridicule shall befall him. For he,\r\nstanding on the doorsteps to grace the departure, is suddenly caught a\r\nmost prodigious thump on the side of his head with a heavy shoe, which\r\na Buffer in the hall, champagne-flushed and wild of aim, has borrowed on\r\nthe spur of the moment from the pastrycook\xe2\x80\x99s porter, to cast after the\r\ndeparting pair as an auspicious omen.\r\n\r\nSo they all go up again into the gorgeous drawing-rooms--all of them\r\nflushed with breakfast, as having taken scarlatina sociably--and there\r\nthe combined unknowns do malignant things with their legs to ottomans,\r\nand take as much as possible out of the splendid furniture. And so, Lady\r\nTippins, quite undetermined whether today is the day before yesterday,\r\nor the day after to-morrow, or the week after next, fades away; and\r\nMortimer Lightwood and Eugene fade away, and Twemlow fades away, and\r\nthe stoney aunt goes away--she declines to fade, proving rock to the\r\nlast--and even the unknowns are slowly strained off, and it is all over.\r\n\r\nAll over, that is to say, for the time being. But, there is another time\r\nto come, and it comes in about a fortnight, and it comes to Mr and Mrs\r\nLammle on the sands at Shanklin, in the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Lammle have walked for some time on the Shanklin sands, and\r\none may see by their footprints that they have not walked arm in arm,\r\nand that they have not walked in a straight track, and that they have\r\nwalked in a moody humour; for, the lady has prodded little spirting\r\nholes in the damp sand before her with her parasol, and the gentleman\r\nhas trailed his stick after him. As if he were of the Mephistopheles\r\nfamily indeed, and had walked with a drooping tail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to tell me, then, Sophronia--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus he begins after a long silence, when Sophronia flashes fiercely,\r\nand turns upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t put it upon ME, sir. I ask you, do YOU mean to tell me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle falls silent again, and they walk as before. Mrs Lammle opens\r\nher nostrils and bites her under-lip; Mr Lammle takes his gingerous\r\nwhiskers in his left hand, and, bringing them together, frowns furtively\r\nat his beloved, out of a thick gingerous bush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I mean to say!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle after a time repeats, with indignation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Putting it on me! The unmanly disingenuousness!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle stops, releases his whiskers, and looks at her. \xe2\x80\x98The what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle haughtily replies, without stopping, and without looking\r\nback. \xe2\x80\x98The meanness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe is at her side again in a pace or two, and he retorts, \xe2\x80\x98That is not\r\nwhat you said. You said disingenuousness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What if I did?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d in the case. You did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did, then. And what of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What of it?\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98Have you the face to utter the word to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The face, too!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs Lammle, staring at him with cold scorn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, how dare you, sir, utter the word to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs this happens to be true, Mrs Lammle is thrown on the feminine\r\nresource of saying, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what you uttered or did not utter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a little more walking and a little more silence, Mr Lammle breaks\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall proceed in your own way. You claim a right to ask me do I\r\nmean to tell you. Do I mean to tell you what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you are a man of property?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you married me on false pretences?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So be it. Next comes what you mean to say. Do you mean to say you are a\r\nwoman of property?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you married me on false pretences.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you were so dull a fortune-hunter that you deceived yourself, or\r\nif you were so greedy and grasping that you were over-willing to be\r\ndeceived by appearances, is it my fault, you adventurer?\xe2\x80\x99 the lady\r\ndemands, with great asperity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I asked Veneering, and he told me you were rich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Veneering!\xe2\x80\x99 with great contempt.\xe2\x80\x99 And what does Veneering know about\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he not your trustee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I have no trustee, but the one you saw on the day when you\r\nfraudulently married me. And his trust is not a very difficult one, for\r\nit is only an annuity of a hundred and fifteen pounds. I think there are\r\nsome odd shillings or pence, if you are very particular.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle bestows a by no means loving look upon the partner of his joys\r\nand sorrows, and he mutters something; but checks himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Question for question. It is my turn again, Mrs Lammle. What made you\r\nsuppose me a man of property?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You made me suppose you so. Perhaps you will deny that you always\r\npresented yourself to me in that character?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you asked somebody, too. Come, Mrs Lammle, admission for admission.\r\nYou asked somebody?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I asked Veneering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Veneering knew as much of me as he knew of you, or as anybody knows\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter more silent walking, the bride stops short, to say in a passionate\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never will forgive the Veneerings for this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither will I,\xe2\x80\x99 returns the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nWith that, they walk again; she, making those angry spirts in the sand;\r\nhe, dragging that dejected tail. The tide is low, and seems to have\r\nthrown them together high on the bare shore. A gull comes sweeping by\r\ntheir heads and flouts them. There was a golden surface on the brown\r\ncliffs but now, and behold they are only damp earth. A taunting roar\r\ncomes from the sea, and the far-out rollers mount upon one another,\r\nto look at the entrapped impostors, and to join in impish and exultant\r\ngambols.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you pretend to believe,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle resumes, sternly, \xe2\x80\x98when you talk\r\nof my marrying you for worldly advantages, that it was within the bounds\r\nof reasonable probability that I would have married you for yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again there are two sides to the question, Mrs Lammle. What do you\r\npretend to believe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you first deceive me and then insult me!\xe2\x80\x99 cries the lady, with a\r\nheaving bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all. I have originated nothing. The double-edged question was\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was mine!\xe2\x80\x99 the bride repeats, and her parasol breaks in her angry hand.\r\n\r\nHis colour has turned to a livid white, and ominous marks have come to\r\nlight about his nose, as if the finger of the very devil himself had,\r\nwithin the last few moments, touched it here and there. But he has\r\nrepressive power, and she has none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Throw it away,\xe2\x80\x99 he coolly recommends as to the parasol; \xe2\x80\x98you have made\r\nit useless; you look ridiculous with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhereupon she calls him in her rage, \xe2\x80\x98A deliberate villain,\xe2\x80\x99 and so\r\ncasts the broken thing from her as that it strikes him in falling. The\r\nfinger-marks are something whiter for the instant, but he walks on at\r\nher side.\r\n\r\nShe bursts into tears, declaring herself the wretchedest, the most\r\ndeceived, the worst-used, of women. Then she says that if she had\r\nthe courage to kill herself, she would do it. Then she calls him vile\r\nimpostor. Then she asks him, why, in the disappointment of his base\r\nspeculation, he does not take her life with his own hand, under the\r\npresent favourable circumstances. Then she cries again. Then she is\r\nenraged again, and makes some mention of swindlers. Finally, she sits\r\ndown crying on a block of stone, and is in all the known and unknown\r\nhumours of her sex at once. Pending her changes, those aforesaid marks\r\nin his face have come and gone, now here now there, like white steps\r\nof a pipe on which the diabolical performer has played a tune. Also his\r\nlivid lips are parted at last, as if he were breathless with running.\r\nYet he is not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, get up, Mrs Lammle, and let us speak reasonably.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sits upon her stone, and takes no heed of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get up, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRaising her head, she looks contemptuously in his face, and repeats,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You tell me! Tell me, forsooth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe affects not to know that his eyes are fastened on her as she droops\r\nher head again; but her whole figure reveals that she knows it uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enough of this. Come! Do you hear? Get up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYielding to his hand, she rises, and they walk again; but this time with\r\ntheir faces turned towards their place of residence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Lammle, we have both been deceiving, and we have both been\r\ndeceived. We have both been biting, and we have both been bitten. In a\r\nnut-shell, there\xe2\x80\x99s the state of the case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You sought me out--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tut! Let us have done with that. WE know very well how it was. Why\r\nshould you and I talk about it, when you and I can\xe2\x80\x99t disguise it? To\r\nproceed. I am disappointed and cut a poor figure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I no one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some one--and I was coming to you, if you had waited a moment. You,\r\ntoo, are disappointed and cut a poor figure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An injured figure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are now cool enough, Sophronia, to see that you can\xe2\x80\x99t be injured\r\nwithout my being equally injured; and that therefore the mere word is\r\nnot to the purpose. When I look back, I wonder how I can have been such\r\na fool as to take you to so great an extent upon trust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when I look back--\xe2\x80\x99 the bride cries, interrupting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when you look back, you wonder how you can have been--you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse\r\nthe word?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most certainly, with so much reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Such a fool as to take ME to so great an extent upon trust. But the\r\nfolly is committed on both sides. I cannot get rid of you; you cannot\r\nget rid of me. What follows?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shame and misery,\xe2\x80\x99 the bride bitterly replies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A mutual understanding follows, and I think it may carry\r\nus through. Here I split my discourse (give me your arm, Sophronia),\r\ninto three heads, to make it shorter and plainer. Firstly, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough\r\nto have been done, without the mortification of being known to have been\r\ndone. So we agree to keep the fact to ourselves. You agree?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it is possible, I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possible! We have pretended well enough to one another. Can\xe2\x80\x99t we,\r\nunited, pretend to the world? Agreed. Secondly, we owe the Veneerings\r\na grudge, and we owe all other people the grudge of wishing them to be\r\ntaken in, as we ourselves have been taken in. Agreed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Agreed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We come smoothly to thirdly. You have called me an adventurer,\r\nSophronia. So I am. In plain uncomplimentary English, so I am. So are\r\nyou, my dear. So are many people. We agree to keep our own secret, and\r\nto work together in furtherance of our own schemes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What schemes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any scheme that will bring us money. By our own schemes, I mean our\r\njoint interest. Agreed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe answers, after a little hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose so. Agreed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Carried at once, you see! Now, Sophronia, only half a dozen words more.\r\nWe know one another perfectly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be tempted into twitting me with\r\nthe past knowledge that you have of me, because it is identical with\r\nthe past knowledge that I have of you, and in twitting me, you\r\ntwit yourself, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear you do it. With this good\r\nunderstanding established between us, it is better never done. To wind\r\nup all:--You have shown temper today, Sophronia. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be betrayed into\r\ndoing so again, because I have a Devil of a temper myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, the happy pair, with this hopeful marriage contract thus signed,\r\nsealed, and delivered, repair homeward. If, when those infernal\r\nfinger-marks were on the white and breathless countenance of Alfred\r\nLammle, Esquire, they denoted that he conceived the purpose of subduing\r\nhis dear wife Mrs Alfred Lammle, by at once divesting her of any\r\nlingering reality or pretence of self-respect, the purpose would seem\r\nto have been presently executed. The mature young lady has mighty little\r\nneed of powder, now, for her downcast face, as he escorts her in the\r\nlight of the setting sun to their abode of bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nPODSNAPPERY\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Podsnap was well to do, and stood very high in Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.\r\nBeginning with a good inheritance, he had married a good inheritance,\r\nand had thriven exceedingly in the Marine Insurance way, and was\r\nquite satisfied. He never could make out why everybody was not quite\r\nsatisfied, and he felt conscious that he set a brilliant social example\r\nin being particularly well satisfied with most things, and, above all\r\nother things, with himself.\r\n\r\nThus happily acquainted with his own merit and importance, Mr Podsnap\r\nsettled that whatever he put behind him he put out of existence. There\r\nwas a dignified conclusiveness--not to add a grand convenience--in\r\nthis way of getting rid of disagreeables which had done much towards\r\nestablishing Mr Podsnap in his lofty place in Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know about it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to discuss it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nadmit it!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Podsnap had even acquired a peculiar flourish of his\r\nright arm in often clearing the world of its most difficult problems, by\r\nsweeping them behind him (and consequently sheer away) with those words\r\nand a flushed face. For they affronted him.\r\n\r\nMr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s world was not a very large world, morally; no, nor even\r\ngeographically: seeing that although his business was sustained upon\r\ncommerce with other countries, he considered other countries, with that\r\nimportant reservation, a mistake, and of their manners and customs would\r\nconclusively observe, \xe2\x80\x98Not English!\xe2\x80\x99 when, PRESTO! with a flourish of\r\nthe arm, and a flush of the face, they were swept away. Elsewise, the\r\nworld got up at eight, shaved close at a quarter-past, breakfasted at\r\nnine, went to the City at ten, came home at half-past five, and dined\r\nat seven. Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s notions of the Arts in their integrity might have\r\nbeen stated thus. Literature; large print, respectfully descriptive of\r\ngetting up at eight, shaving close at a quarter past, breakfasting\r\nat nine, going to the City at ten, coming home at half-past five,\r\nand dining at seven. Painting and Sculpture; models and portraits\r\nrepresenting Professors of getting up at eight, shaving close at a\r\nquarter past, breakfasting at nine, going to the City at ten, coming\r\nhome at half-past five, and dining at seven. Music; a respectable\r\nperformance (without variations) on stringed and wind instruments,\r\nsedately expressive of getting up at eight, shaving close at a quarter\r\npast, breakfasting at nine, going to the City at ten, coming home at\r\nhalf-past five, and dining at seven. Nothing else to be permitted to\r\nthose same vagrants the Arts, on pain of excommunication. Nothing else\r\nTo Be--anywhere!\r\n\r\nAs a so eminently respectable man, Mr Podsnap was sensible of its being\r\nrequired of him to take Providence under his protection. Consequently he\r\nalways knew exactly what Providence meant. Inferior and less respectable\r\nmen might fall short of that mark, but Mr Podsnap was always up to it.\r\nAnd it was very remarkable (and must have been very comfortable) that\r\nwhat Providence meant, was invariably what Mr Podsnap meant.\r\n\r\nThese may be said to have been the articles of a faith and school\r\nwhich the present chapter takes the liberty of calling, after its\r\nrepresentative man, Podsnappery. They were confined within close bounds,\r\nas Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s own head was confined by his shirt-collar; and they\r\nwere enunciated with a sounding pomp that smacked of the creaking of Mr\r\nPodsnap\xe2\x80\x99s own boots.\r\n\r\nThere was a Miss Podsnap. And this young rocking-horse was being trained\r\nin her mother\xe2\x80\x99s art of prancing in a stately manner without ever getting\r\non. But the high parental action was not yet imparted to her, and\r\nin truth she was but an undersized damsel, with high shoulders, low\r\nspirits, chilled elbows, and a rasped surface of nose, who seemed to\r\ntake occasional frosty peeps out of childhood into womanhood, and to\r\nshrink back again, overcome by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s head-dress and her father\r\nfrom head to foot--crushed by the mere dead-weight of Podsnappery.\r\n\r\nA certain institution in Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s mind which he called \xe2\x80\x98the young\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99 may be considered to have been embodied in Miss Podsnap, his\r\ndaughter. It was an inconvenient and exacting institution, as requiring\r\neverything in the universe to be filed down and fitted to it. The\r\nquestion about everything was, would it bring a blush into the cheek of\r\nthe young person? And the inconvenience of the young person was, that,\r\naccording to Mr Podsnap, she seemed always liable to burst into\r\nblushes when there was no need at all. There appeared to be no line of\r\ndemarcation between the young person\xe2\x80\x99s excessive innocence, and another\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s guiltiest knowledge. Take Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s word for it, and the\r\nsoberest tints of drab, white, lilac, and grey, were all flaming red to\r\nthis troublesome Bull of a young person.\r\n\r\nThe Podsnaps lived in a shady angle adjoining Portman Square. They were\r\na kind of people certain to dwell in the shade, wherever they dwelt.\r\nMiss Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s life had been, from her first appearance on this planet,\r\naltogether of a shady order; for, Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s young person was likely\r\nto get little good out of association with other young persons, and had\r\ntherefore been restricted to companionship with not very congenial older\r\npersons, and with massive furniture. Miss Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s early views of life\r\nbeing principally derived from the reflections of it in her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboots, and in the walnut and rosewood tables of the dim drawing-rooms,\r\nand in their swarthy giants of looking-glasses, were of a sombre cast;\r\nand it was not wonderful that now, when she was on most days solemnly\r\ntooled through the Park by the side of her mother in a great tall\r\ncustard-coloured phaeton, she showed above the apron of that vehicle\r\nlike a dejected young person sitting up in bed to take a startled look\r\nat things in general, and very strongly desiring to get her head under\r\nthe counterpane again.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr Podsnap to Mrs Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98Georgiana is almost eighteen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Mrs Podsnap to Mr Podsnap, assenting, \xe2\x80\x98Almost eighteen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Mr Podsnap then to Mrs Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98Really I think we should have some\r\npeople on Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s birthday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Mrs Podsnap then to Mr Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98Which will enable us to clear off\r\nall those people who are due.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that Mr and Mrs Podsnap requested the honour of the\r\ncompany of seventeen friends of their souls at dinner; and that they\r\nsubstituted other friends of their souls for such of the seventeen\r\noriginal friends of their souls as deeply regretted that a prior\r\nengagement prevented their having the honour of dining with Mr and Mrs\r\nPodsnap, in pursuance of their kind invitation; and that Mrs Podsnap\r\nsaid of all these inconsolable personages, as she checked them off with\r\na pencil in her list, \xe2\x80\x98Asked, at any rate, and got rid of;\xe2\x80\x99 and that\r\nthey successfully disposed of a good many friends of their souls in this\r\nway, and felt their consciences much lightened.\r\n\r\nThere were still other friends of their souls who were not entitled to\r\nbe asked to dinner, but had a claim to be invited to come and take a\r\nhaunch of mutton vapour-bath at half-past nine. For the clearing off\r\nof these worthies, Mrs Podsnap added a small and early evening to the\r\ndinner, and looked in at the music-shop to bespeak a well-conducted\r\nautomaton to come and play quadrilles for a carpet dance.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Veneering, and Mr and Mrs Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s bran-new bride and\r\nbridegroom, were of the dinner company; but the Podsnap establishment\r\nhad nothing else in common with the Veneerings. Mr Podsnap could\r\ntolerate taste in a mushroom man who stood in need of that sort\r\nof thing, but was far above it himself. Hideous solidity was the\r\ncharacteristic of the Podsnap plate. Everything was made to look as\r\nheavy as it could, and to take up as much room as possible. Everything\r\nsaid boastfully, \xe2\x80\x98Here you have as much of me in my ugliness as if I\r\nwere only lead; but I am so many ounces of precious metal worth so much\r\nan ounce;--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to melt me down?\xe2\x80\x99 A corpulent straddling\r\nepergne, blotched all over as if it had broken out in an eruption rather\r\nthan been ornamented, delivered this address from an unsightly silver\r\nplatform in the centre of the table. Four silver wine-coolers, each\r\nfurnished with four staring heads, each head obtrusively carrying a big\r\nsilver ring in each of its ears, conveyed the sentiment up and down the\r\ntable, and handed it on to the pot-bellied silver salt-cellars. All the\r\nbig silver spoons and forks widened the mouths of the company expressly\r\nfor the purpose of thrusting the sentiment down their throats with every\r\nmorsel they ate.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the guests were like the plate, and included several\r\nheavy articles weighing ever so much. But there was a foreign gentleman\r\namong them: whom Mr Podsnap had invited after much debate with\r\nhimself--believing the whole European continent to be in mortal alliance\r\nagainst the young person--and there was a droll disposition, not only on\r\nthe part of Mr Podsnap but of everybody else, to treat him as if he were\r\na child who was hard of hearing.\r\n\r\nAs a delicate concession to this unfortunately-born foreigner, Mr\r\nPodsnap, in receiving him, had presented his wife as \xe2\x80\x98Madame Podsnap;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nalso his daughter as \xe2\x80\x98Mademoiselle Podsnap,\xe2\x80\x99 with some inclination to\r\nadd \xe2\x80\x98ma fille,\xe2\x80\x99 in which bold venture, however, he checked himself. The\r\nVeneerings being at that time the only other arrivals, he had added (in\r\na condescendingly explanatory manner), \xe2\x80\x98Monsieur Vey-nair-reeng,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhad then subsided into English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How Do You Like London?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Podsnap now inquired from his station of\r\nhost, as if he were administering something in the nature of a powder or\r\npotion to the deaf child; \xe2\x80\x98London, Londres, London?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe foreign gentleman admired it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You find it Very Large?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, spaciously.\r\n\r\nThe foreign gentleman found it very large.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Very Rich?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe foreign gentleman found it, without doubt, enormement riche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enormously Rich, We say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Podsnap, in a condescending\r\nmanner. \xe2\x80\x98Our English adverbs do Not terminate in Mong, and We Pronounce\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cch\xe2\x80\x9d as if there were a \xe2\x80\x9ct\xe2\x80\x9d before it. We say Ritch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Reetch,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the foreign gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Do You Find, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Podsnap, with dignity, \xe2\x80\x98Many\r\nEvidences that Strike You, of our British Constitution in the Streets Of\r\nThe World\xe2\x80\x99s Metropolis, London, Londres, London?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe foreign gentleman begged to be pardoned, but did not altogether\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Constitution Britannique,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Podsnap explained, as if he were\r\nteaching in an infant school. \xe2\x80\x98We Say British, But You Say Britannique,\r\nYou Know\xe2\x80\x99 (forgivingly, as if that were not his fault). \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nConstitution, Sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe foreign gentleman said, \xe2\x80\x98Mais, yees; I know eem.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA youngish sallowish gentleman in spectacles, with a lumpy forehead,\r\nseated in a supplementary chair at a corner of the table, here caused\r\na profound sensation by saying, in a raised voice, \xe2\x80\x98ESKER,\xe2\x80\x99 and then\r\nstopping dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mais oui,\xe2\x80\x99 said the foreign gentleman, turning towards him. \xe2\x80\x98Est-ce\r\nque? Quoi donc?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman with the lumpy forehead having for the time delivered\r\nhimself of all that he found behind his lumps, spake for the time no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I Was Inquiring,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, resuming the thread of his\r\ndiscourse, \xe2\x80\x98Whether You Have Observed in our Streets as We should say,\r\nUpon our Pavvy as You would say, any Tokens--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe foreign gentleman, with patient courtesy entreated pardon; \xe2\x80\x98But what\r\nwas tokenz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marks,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap; \xe2\x80\x98Signs, you know, Appearances--Traces.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Of a Orse?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the foreign gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We call it Horse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, with forbearance. \xe2\x80\x98In England,\r\nAngleterre, England, We Aspirate the \xe2\x80\x9cH,\xe2\x80\x9d and We Say \xe2\x80\x9cHorse.\xe2\x80\x9d Only our\r\nLower Classes Say \xe2\x80\x9cOrse!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 said the foreign gentleman; \xe2\x80\x98I am alwiz wrong!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our Language,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, with a gracious consciousness of being\r\nalways right, \xe2\x80\x98is Difficult. Ours is a Copious Language, and Trying to\r\nStrangers. I will not Pursue my Question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the lumpy gentleman, unwilling to give it up, again madly said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ESKER,\xe2\x80\x99 and again spake no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It merely referred,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Podsnap explained, with a sense of meritorious\r\nproprietorship, \xe2\x80\x98to Our Constitution, Sir. We Englishmen are Very Proud\r\nof our Constitution, Sir. It Was Bestowed Upon Us By Providence. No\r\nOther Country is so Favoured as This Country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And ozer countries?--\xe2\x80\x99 the foreign gentleman was beginning, when Mr\r\nPodsnap put him right again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We do not say Ozer; we say Other: the letters are \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cH;\xe2\x80\x9d You say\r\nTay and Aish, You Know; (still with clemency). The sound is \xe2\x80\x9cth\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cth!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And OTHER countries,\xe2\x80\x99 said the foreign gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98They do how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They do, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Podsnap, gravely shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x98they\r\ndo--I am sorry to be obliged to say it--AS they do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a little particular of Providence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the foreign gentleman,\r\nlaughing; \xe2\x80\x98for the frontier is not large.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Undoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr Podsnap; \xe2\x80\x98But So it is. It was the Charter\r\nof the Land. This Island was Blest, Sir, to the Direct Exclusion of\r\nsuch Other Countries as--as there may happen to be. And if we were all\r\nEnglishmen present, I would say,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr Podsnap, looking round upon\r\nhis compatriots, and sounding solemnly with his theme, \xe2\x80\x98that there is in\r\nthe Englishman a combination of qualities, a modesty, an independence,\r\na responsibility, a repose, combined with an absence of everything\r\ncalculated to call a blush into the cheek of a young person, which one\r\nwould seek in vain among the Nations of the Earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving delivered this little summary, Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed, as he\r\nthought of the remote possibility of its being at all qualified by\r\nany prejudiced citizen of any other country; and, with his favourite\r\nright-arm flourish, he put the rest of Europe and the whole of Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America nowhere.\r\n\r\nThe audience were much edified by this passage of words; and Mr Podsnap,\r\nfeeling that he was in rather remarkable force to-day, became smiling\r\nand conversational.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has anything more been heard, Veneering,\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired, \xe2\x80\x98of the lucky\r\nlegatee?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing more,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98than that he has come into\r\npossession of the property. I am told people now call him The Golden\r\nDustman. I mentioned to you some time ago, I think, that the young lady\r\nwhose intended husband was murdered is daughter to a clerk of mine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you told me that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Podsnap; \xe2\x80\x98and by-the-bye, I wish you would\r\ntell it again here, for it\xe2\x80\x99s a curious coincidence--curious that the\r\nfirst news of the discovery should have been brought straight to your\r\ntable (when I was there), and curious that one of your people should\r\nhave been so nearly interested in it. Just relate that, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering was more than ready to do it, for he had prospered exceedingly\r\nupon the Harmon Murder, and had turned the social distinction it\r\nconferred upon him to the account of making several dozen of bran-new\r\nbosom-friends. Indeed, such another lucky hit would almost have set him\r\nup in that way to his satisfaction. So, addressing himself to the most\r\ndesirable of his neighbours, while Mrs Veneering secured the next most\r\ndesirable, he plunged into the case, and emerged from it twenty minutes\r\nafterwards with a Bank Director in his arms. In the mean time, Mrs\r\nVeneering had dived into the same waters for a wealthy Ship-Broker, and\r\nhad brought him up, safe and sound, by the hair. Then Mrs Veneering had\r\nto relate, to a larger circle, how she had been to see the girl, and how\r\nshe was really pretty, and (considering her station) presentable.\r\nAnd this she did with such a successful display of her eight aquiline\r\nfingers and their encircling jewels, that she happily laid hold of a\r\ndrifting General Officer, his wife and daughter, and not only restored\r\ntheir animation which had become suspended, but made them lively friends\r\nwithin an hour.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr Podsnap would in a general way have highly disapproved of\r\nBodies in rivers as ineligible topics with reference to the cheek of the\r\nyoung person, he had, as one may say, a share in this affair which made\r\nhim a part proprietor. As its returns were immediate, too, in the way\r\nof restraining the company from speechless contemplation of the\r\nwine-coolers, it paid, and he was satisfied.\r\n\r\nAnd now the haunch of mutton vapour-bath having received a gamey\r\ninfusion, and a few last touches of sweets and coffee, was quite ready,\r\nand the bathers came; but not before the discreet automaton had got\r\nbehind the bars of the piano music-desk, and there presented the\r\nappearance of a captive languishing in a rose-wood jail. And who now\r\nso pleasant or so well assorted as Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle, he all\r\nsparkle, she all gracious contentment, both at occasional intervals\r\nexchanging looks like partners at cards who played a game against All\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThere was not much youth among the bathers, but there was no youth\r\n(the young person always excepted) in the articles of Podsnappery. Bald\r\nbathers folded their arms and talked to Mr Podsnap on the hearthrug;\r\nsleek-whiskered bathers, with hats in their hands, lunged at Mrs Podsnap\r\nand retreated; prowling bathers, went about looking into ornamental\r\nboxes and bowls as if they had suspicions of larceny on the part of the\r\nPodsnaps, and expected to find something they had lost at the bottom;\r\nbathers of the gentler sex sat silently comparing ivory shoulders. All\r\nthis time and always, poor little Miss Podsnap, whose tiny efforts (if\r\nshe had made any) were swallowed up in the magnificence of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrocking, kept herself as much out of sight and mind as she could,\r\nand appeared to be counting on many dismal returns of the day. It was\r\nsomehow understood, as a secret article in the state proprieties of\r\nPodsnappery that nothing must be said about the day. Consequently this\r\nyoung damsel\xe2\x80\x99s nativity was hushed up and looked over, as if it were\r\nagreed on all hands that it would have been better that she had never\r\nbeen born.\r\n\r\nThe Lammles were so fond of the dear Veneerings that they could not for\r\nsome time detach themselves from those excellent friends; but at length,\r\neither a very open smile on Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s part, or a very secret elevation\r\nof one of his gingerous eyebrows--certainly the one or the other--seemed\r\nto say to Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you play?\xe2\x80\x99 And so, looking about her,\r\nshe saw Miss Podsnap, and seeming to say responsively, \xe2\x80\x98That card?\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nto be answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 went and sat beside Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle was overjoyed to escape into a corner for a little quiet\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\nIt promised to be a very quiet talk, for Miss Podsnap replied in a\r\nflutter, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you, but I am afraid I DON\xe2\x80\x99T\r\ntalk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us make a beginning,\xe2\x80\x99 said the insinuating Mrs Lammle, with her\r\nbest smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I am afraid you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me very dull. But Ma talks!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was plainly to be seen, for Ma was talking then at her usual\r\ncanter, with arched head and mane, opened eyes and nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fond of reading perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. At least I--don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that so much,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98M-m-m-m-music.\xe2\x80\x99 So insinuating was Mrs Lammle that she got half a dozen\r\nms into the word before she got it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t nerve to play even if I could. Ma plays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(At exactly the same canter, and with a certain flourishing appearance\r\nof doing something, Ma did, in fact, occasionally take a rock upon the\r\ninstrument.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you like dancing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No? With your youth and attractions? Truly, my dear, you surprise me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Miss Podsnap, after hesitating considerably, and\r\nstealing several timid looks at Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s carefully arranged face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98how I might have liked it if I had been a--you won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, WILL\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear! Never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I am sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say then how I should have liked it,\r\nif I had been a chimney-sweep on May-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious!\xe2\x80\x99 was the exclamation which amazement elicited from Mrs\r\nLammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There! I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d wonder. But you won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98you make me ten times more\r\ndesirous, now I talk to you, to know you well than I was when I sat over\r\nyonder looking at you. How I wish we could be real friends! Try me as a\r\nreal friend. Come! Don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy me a frumpy old married woman, my dear;\r\nI was married but the other day, you know; I am dressed as a bride now,\r\nyou see. About the chimney-sweeps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! Ma\xe2\x80\x99ll hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She can\xe2\x80\x99t hear from where she sits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be too sure of that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap, in a lower voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what I mean is, that they seem to enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that perhaps you would have enjoyed it, if you had been one of\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Podsnap nodded significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it possible?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98Oh it is such a dreadful\r\nthing! If I was wicked enough--and strong enough--to kill anybody, it\r\nshould be my partner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was such an entirely new view of the Terpsichorean art as\r\nsocially practised, that Mrs Lammle looked at her young friend in some\r\nastonishment. Her young friend sat nervously twiddling her fingers in\r\na pinioned attitude, as if she were trying to hide her elbows. But this\r\nlatter Utopian object (in short sleeves) always appeared to be the great\r\ninoffensive aim of her existence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It sounds horrid, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap, with a penitential\r\nface.\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle, not very well knowing what to answer, resolved herself into\r\na look of smiling encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it is, and it always has been,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Miss Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98such a trial\r\nto me! I so dread being awful. And it is so awful! No one knows what\r\nI suffered at Madame Sauteuse\xe2\x80\x99s, where I learnt to dance and make\r\npresentation-curtseys, and other dreadful things--or at least where they\r\ntried to teach me. Ma can do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, soothingly, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s over,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing gained by\r\nthat. It\xe2\x80\x99s worse here, than at Madame Sauteuse\xe2\x80\x99s. Ma was there, and Ma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhere; but Pa wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, and company wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, and there were not\r\nreal partners there. Oh there\xe2\x80\x99s Ma speaking to the man at the piano! Oh\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s Ma going up to somebody! Oh I know she\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring him\r\nto me! Oh please don\xe2\x80\x99t, please don\xe2\x80\x99t, please don\xe2\x80\x99t! Oh keep away, keep\r\naway, keep away!\xe2\x80\x99 These pious ejaculations Miss Podsnap uttered with her\r\neyes closed, and her head leaning back against the wall.\r\n\r\nBut the Ogre advanced under the pilotage of Ma, and Ma said, \xe2\x80\x98Georgiana,\r\nMr Grompus,\xe2\x80\x99 and the Ogre clutched his victim and bore her off to his\r\ncastle in the top couple. Then the discreet automaton who had surveyed\r\nhis ground, played a blossomless tuneless \xe2\x80\x98set,\xe2\x80\x99 and sixteen disciples\r\nof Podsnappery went through the figures of - 1, Getting up at eight and\r\nshaving close at a quarter past - 2, Breakfasting at nine - 3, Going to\r\nthe City at ten - 4, Coming home at half-past five - 5, Dining at seven,\r\nand the grand chain.\r\n\r\nWhile these solemnities were in progress, Mr Alfred Lammle (most loving\r\nof husbands) approached the chair of Mrs Alfred Lammle (most loving of\r\nwives), and bending over the back of it, trifled for some few seconds\r\nwith Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s bracelet. Slightly in contrast with this brief airy\r\ntoying, one might have noticed a certain dark attention in Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface as she said some words with her eyes on Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat, and\r\nseemed in return to receive some lesson. But it was all done as a breath\r\npasses from a mirror.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the grand chain riveted to the last link, the discreet\r\nautomaton ceased, and the sixteen, two and two, took a walk among\r\nthe furniture. And herein the unconsciousness of the Ogre Grompus was\r\npleasantly conspicuous; for, that complacent monster, believing that\r\nhe was giving Miss Podsnap a treat, prolonged to the utmost stretch\r\nof possibility a peripatetic account of an archery meeting; while his\r\nvictim, heading the procession of sixteen as it slowly circled about,\r\nlike a revolving funeral, never raised her eyes except once to steal a\r\nglance at Mrs Lammle, expressive of intense despair.\r\n\r\nAt length the procession was dissolved by the violent arrival of a\r\nnutmeg, before which the drawing-room door bounced open as if it were a\r\ncannon-ball; and while that fragrant article, dispersed through several\r\nglasses of coloured warm water, was going the round of society, Miss\r\nPodsnap returned to her seat by her new friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my goodness,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98THAT\xe2\x80\x99S over! I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook at me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh I know all about myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something I know about you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Lammle\r\nin her winning way, \xe2\x80\x98and that is, you are most unnecessarily shy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98--I detest you! Go along!\xe2\x80\x99 This shot\r\nwas levelled under her breath at the gallant Grompus for bestowing an\r\ninsinuating smile upon her in passing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me if I scarcely see, my dear Miss Podsnap,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle was\r\nbeginning when the young lady interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we are going to be real friends (and I suppose we are, for you are\r\nthe only person who ever proposed it) don\xe2\x80\x99t let us be awful. It\xe2\x80\x99s awful\r\nenough to BE Miss Podsnap, without being called so. Call me Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Georgiana,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Georgiana, pardon me if I scarcely see, my love, why your\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x99s not being shy, is a reason why you should be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you really see that?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Podsnap, plucking at her fingers\r\nin a troubled manner, and furtively casting her eyes now on Mrs Lammle,\r\nnow on the ground. \xe2\x80\x98Then perhaps it isn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dearest Georgiana, you defer much too readily to my poor opinion.\r\nIndeed it is not even an opinion, darling, for it is only a confession\r\nof my dullness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh YOU are not dull,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98I am dull, but you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made me talk if you were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSome little touch of conscience answering this perception of her having\r\ngained a purpose, called bloom enough into Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s face to make it\r\nlook brighter as she sat smiling her best smile on her dear Georgiana,\r\nand shaking her head with an affectionate playfulness. Not that it meant\r\nanything, but that Georgiana seemed to like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I mean is,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Georgiana, \xe2\x80\x98that Ma being so endowed with\r\nawfulness, and Pa being so endowed with awfulness, and there being\r\nso much awfulness everywhere--I mean, at least, everywhere where I\r\nam--perhaps it makes me who am so deficient in awfulness, and frightened\r\nat it--I say it very badly--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you can understand what\r\nI mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly, dearest Georgiana!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle was proceeding with every\r\nreassuring wile, when the head of that young lady suddenly went back\r\nagainst the wall again and her eyes closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh there\xe2\x80\x99s Ma being awful with somebody with a glass in his eye! Oh I\r\nknow she\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring him here! Oh don\xe2\x80\x99t bring him, don\xe2\x80\x99t bring him!\r\nOh he\xe2\x80\x99ll be my partner with his glass in his eye! Oh what shall I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis time Georgiana accompanied her ejaculations with taps of her feet\r\nupon the floor, and was altogether in quite a desperate condition. But,\r\nthere was no escape from the majestic Mrs Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s production of an\r\nambling stranger, with one eye screwed up into extinction and the other\r\nframed and glazed, who, having looked down out of that organ, as if he\r\ndescried Miss Podsnap at the bottom of some perpendicular shaft, brought\r\nher to the surface, and ambled off with her. And then the captive at the\r\npiano played another \xe2\x80\x98set,\xe2\x80\x99 expressive of his mournful aspirations after\r\nfreedom, and other sixteen went through the former melancholy motions,\r\nand the ambler took Miss Podsnap for a furniture walk, as if he had\r\nstruck out an entirely original conception.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time a stray personage of a meek demeanour, who had wandered\r\nto the hearthrug and got among the heads of tribes assembled there in\r\nconference with Mr Podsnap, eliminated Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s flush and\r\nflourish by a highly unpolite remark; no less than a reference to the\r\ncircumstance that some half-dozen people had lately died in the streets,\r\nof starvation. It was clearly ill-timed after dinner. It was not adapted\r\nto the cheek of the young person. It was not in good taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, putting it behind him.\r\n\r\nThe meek man was afraid we must take it as proved, because there were\r\nthe Inquests and the Registrar\xe2\x80\x99s returns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it was their own fault,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap.\r\n\r\nVeneering and other elders of tribes commended this way out of it. At\r\nonce a short cut and a broad road.\r\n\r\nThe man of meek demeanour intimated that truly it would seem from\r\nthe facts, as if starvation had been forced upon the culprits in\r\nquestion--as if, in their wretched manner, they had made their weak\r\nprotests against it--as if they would have taken the liberty of staving\r\nit off if they could--as if they would rather not have been starved upon\r\nthe whole, if perfectly agreeable to all parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, flushing angrily, \xe2\x80\x98there is not a\r\ncountry in the world, sir, where so noble a provision is made for the\r\npoor as in this country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe meek man was quite willing to concede that, but perhaps it\r\nrendered the matter even worse, as showing that there must be something\r\nappallingly wrong somewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap.\r\n\r\nThe meek man hinted Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be well to try, very seriously, to find\r\nout where?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98Easy to say somewhere; not so easy to say\r\nwhere! But I see what you are driving at. I knew it from the first.\r\nCentralization. No. Never with my consent. Not English.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAn approving murmur arose from the heads of tribes; as saying, \xe2\x80\x98There\r\nyou have him! Hold him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was not aware (the meek man submitted of himself) that he was driving\r\nat any ization. He had no favourite ization that he knew of. But he\r\ncertainly was more staggered by these terrible occurrences than he was\r\nby names, of howsoever so many syllables. Might he ask, was dying of\r\ndestitution and neglect necessarily English?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know what the population of London is, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap.\r\n\r\nThe meek man supposed he did, but supposed that had absolutely nothing\r\nto do with it, if its laws were well administered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you know; at least I hope you know;\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap, with\r\nseverity, \xe2\x80\x98that Providence has declared that you shall have the poor\r\nalways with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe meek man also hoped he knew that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Podsnap with a portentous air. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nglad to hear it. It will render you cautious how you fly in the face of\r\nProvidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn reference to that absurd and irreverent conventional phrase, the meek\r\nman said, for which Mr Podsnap was not responsible, he the meek man had\r\nno fear of doing anything so impossible; but--\r\n\r\nBut Mr Podsnap felt that the time had come for flushing and flourishing\r\nthis meek man down for good. So he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must decline to pursue this painful discussion. It is not pleasant to\r\nmy feelings; it is repugnant to my feelings. I have said that I do not\r\nadmit these things. I have also said that if they do occur (not that I\r\nadmit it), the fault lies with the sufferers themselves. It is not for\r\nME\xe2\x80\x99--Mr Podsnap pointed \xe2\x80\x98me\xe2\x80\x99 forcibly, as adding by implication though\r\nit may be all very well for YOU--\xe2\x80\x98it is not for me to impugn the\r\nworkings of Providence. I know better than that, I trust, and I have\r\nmentioned what the intentions of Providence are. Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr Podsnap, flushing high up among his hair-brushes, with a strong\r\nconsciousness of personal affront, \xe2\x80\x98the subject is a very disagreeable\r\none. I will go so far as to say it is an odious one. It is not one to be\r\nintroduced among our wives and young persons, and I--\xe2\x80\x99 He finished with\r\nthat flourish of his arm which added more expressively than any words,\r\nAnd I remove it from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with this quenching of the meek man\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectual fire;\r\nGeorgiana having left the ambler up a lane of sofa, in a No Thoroughfare\r\nof back drawing-room, to find his own way out, came back to Mrs Lammle.\r\nAnd who should be with Mrs Lammle, but Mr Lammle. So fond of her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred, my love, here is my friend. Georgiana, dearest girl, you must\r\nlike my husband next to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle was proud to be so soon distinguished by this special\r\ncommendation to Miss Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s favour. But if Mr Lammle were prone to be\r\njealous of his dear Sophronia\xe2\x80\x99s friendships, he would be jealous of her\r\nfeeling towards Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say Georgiana, darling,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Towards--shall I?--Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Lammle uttered the name, with a\r\ndelicate curve of his right hand, from his lips outward. \xe2\x80\x98For never have\r\nI known Sophronia (who is not apt to take sudden likings) so attracted\r\nand so captivated as she is by--shall I once more?--Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe object of this homage sat uneasily enough in receipt of it, and then\r\nsaid, turning to Mrs Lammle, much embarrassed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder what you like me for! I am sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Georgiana, for yourself. For your difference from all around\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! That may be. For I think I like you for your difference from all\r\naround me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Georgiana with a smile of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must be going with the rest,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mrs Lammle, rising with a\r\nshow of unwillingness, amidst a general dispersal. \xe2\x80\x98We are real friends,\r\nGeorgiana dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Real.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night, dear girl!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had established an attraction over the shrinking nature upon which\r\nher smiling eyes were fixed, for Georgiana held her hand while she\r\nanswered in a secret and half-frightened tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget me when you are gone away. And come again soon. Good\r\nnight!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharming to see Mr and Mrs Lammle taking leave so gracefully, and going\r\ndown the stairs so lovingly and sweetly. Not quite so charming to see\r\ntheir smiling faces fall and brood as they dropped moodily into separate\r\ncorners of their little carriage. But to be sure that was a sight behind\r\nthe scenes, which nobody saw, and which nobody was meant to see.\r\n\r\nCertain big, heavy vehicles, built on the model of the Podsnap plate,\r\ntook away the heavy articles of guests weighing ever so much; and the\r\nless valuable articles got away after their various manners; and the\r\nPodsnap plate was put to bed. As Mr Podsnap stood with his back to the\r\ndrawing-room fire, pulling up his shirtcollar, like a veritable cock\r\nof the walk literally pluming himself in the midst of his possessions,\r\nnothing would have astonished him more than an intimation that Miss\r\nPodsnap, or any other young person properly born and bred, could not be\r\nexactly put away like the plate, brought out like the plate, polished\r\nlike the plate, counted, weighed, and valued like the plate. That such\r\na young person could possibly have a morbid vacancy in the heart for\r\nanything younger than the plate, or less monotonous than the plate;\r\nor that such a young person\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts could try to scale the region\r\nbounded on the north, south, east, and west, by the plate; was a\r\nmonstrous imagination which he would on the spot have flourished into\r\nspace. This perhaps in some sort arose from Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s blushing young\r\nperson being, so to speak, all cheek; whereas there is a possibility\r\nthat there may be young persons of a rather more complex organization.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Podsnap, pulling up his shirt-collar, could only have heard\r\nhimself called \xe2\x80\x98that fellow\xe2\x80\x99 in a certain short dialogue, which passed\r\nbetween Mr and Mrs Lammle in their opposite corners of their little\r\ncarriage, rolling home!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, are you awake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I likely to be asleep, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very likely, I should think, after that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s company. Attend to\r\nwhat I am going to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have attended to what you have already said, have I not? What else\r\nhave I been doing all to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Attend, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 (in a raised voice) \xe2\x80\x98to what I am going to say.\r\nKeep close to that idiot girl. Keep her under your thumb. You have her\r\nfast, and you are not to let her go. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hear you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I foresee there is money to be made out of this, besides taking that\r\nfellow down a peg. We owe each other money, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle winced a little at the reminder, but only enough to shake her\r\nscents and essences anew into the atmosphere of the little carriage, as\r\nshe settled herself afresh in her own dark corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nTHE SWEAT OF AN HONEST MAN\xe2\x80\x99S BROW\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn took a coffee-house dinner\r\ntogether in Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s office. They had newly agreed to set up a\r\njoint establishment together. They had taken a bachelor cottage near\r\nHampton, on the brink of the Thames, with a lawn, and a boat-house; and\r\nall things fitting, and were to float with the stream through the summer\r\nand the Long Vacation.\r\n\r\nIt was not summer yet, but spring; and it was not gentle spring\r\nethereally mild, as in Thomson\xe2\x80\x99s Seasons, but nipping spring with an\r\neasterly wind, as in Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s, Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s, Dickson\xe2\x80\x99s, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\nJones\xe2\x80\x99s Seasons. The grating wind sawed rather than blew; and as it\r\nsawed, the sawdust whirled about the sawpit. Every street was a sawpit,\r\nand there were no top-sawyers; every passenger was an under-sawyer, with\r\nthe sawdust blinding him and choking him.\r\n\r\nThat mysterious paper currency which circulates in London when the\r\nwind blows, gyrated here and there and everywhere. Whence can it come,\r\nwhither can it go? It hangs on every bush, flutters in every tree, is\r\ncaught flying by the electric wires, haunts every enclosure, drinks at\r\nevery pump, cowers at every grating, shudders upon every plot of grass,\r\nseeks rest in vain behind the legions of iron rails. In Paris, where\r\nnothing is wasted, costly and luxurious city though it be, but where\r\nwonderful human ants creep out of holes and pick up every scrap, there\r\nis no such thing. There, it blows nothing but dust. There, sharp eyes\r\nand sharp stomachs reap even the east wind, and get something out of it.\r\n\r\nThe wind sawed, and the sawdust whirled. The shrubs wrung their many\r\nhands, bemoaning that they had been over-persuaded by the sun to bud;\r\nthe young leaves pined; the sparrows repented of their early marriages,\r\nlike men and women; the colours of the rainbow were discernible, not\r\nin floral spring, but in the faces of the people whom it nibbled and\r\npinched. And ever the wind sawed, and the sawdust whirled.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring evenings are too long and light to shut out, and such\r\nweather is rife, the city which Mr Podsnap so explanatorily called\r\nLondon, Londres, London, is at its worst. Such a black shrill city,\r\ncombining the qualities of a smoky house and a scolding wife; such a\r\ngritty city; such a hopeless city, with no rent in the leaden canopy of\r\nits sky; such a beleaguered city, invested by the great Marsh Forces of\r\nEssex and Kent. So the two old schoolfellows felt it to be, as, their\r\ndinner done, they turned towards the fire to smoke. Young Blight was\r\ngone, the coffee-house waiter was gone, the plates and dishes were gone,\r\nthe wine was going--but not in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The wind sounds up here,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Eugene, stirring the fire, \xe2\x80\x98as if we\r\nwere keeping a lighthouse. I wish we were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it would bore us?\xe2\x80\x99 Lightwood asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not more than any other place. And there would be no Circuit to go. But\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a selfish consideration, personal to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And no clients to come,\xe2\x80\x99 added Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98Not that that\xe2\x80\x99s a selfish\r\nconsideration at all personal to ME.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we were on an isolated rock in a stormy sea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, smoking\r\nwith his eyes on the fire, \xe2\x80\x98Lady Tippins couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put off to visit us,\r\nor, better still, might put off and get swamped. People couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask one\r\nto wedding breakfasts. There would be no Precedents to hammer at,\r\nexcept the plain-sailing Precedent of keeping the light up. It would be\r\nexciting to look out for wrecks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But otherwise,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98there might be a degree of\r\nsameness in the life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have thought of that also,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, as if he really had been\r\nconsidering the subject in its various bearings with an eye to the\r\nbusiness; \xe2\x80\x98but it would be a defined and limited monotony. It would\r\nnot extend beyond two people. Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a question with me, Mortimer,\r\nwhether a monotony defined with that precision and limited to that\r\nextent, might not be more endurable than the unlimited monotony of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfellow-creatures.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Lightwood laughed and passed the wine, he remarked, \xe2\x80\x98We shall have an\r\nopportunity, in our boating summer, of trying the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An imperfect one,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene acquiesced, with a sigh, \xe2\x80\x98but so we shall. I\r\nhope we may not prove too much for one another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, regarding your respected father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, bringing him\r\nto a subject they had expressly appointed to discuss: always the most\r\nslippery eel of eels of subjects to lay hold of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, regarding my respected father,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Eugene, settling himself\r\nin his arm-chair. \xe2\x80\x98I would rather have approached my respected father by\r\ncandlelight, as a theme requiring a little artificial brilliancy; but we\r\nwill take him by twilight, enlivened with a glow of Wallsend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stirred the fire again as he spoke, and having made it blaze,\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My respected father has found, down in the parental neighbourhood, a\r\nwife for his not-generally-respected son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With some money, of course?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With some money, of course, or he would not have found her. My\r\nrespected father--let me shorten the dutiful tautology by substituting\r\nin future M. R. F., which sounds military, and rather like the Duke of\r\nWellington.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an absurd fellow you are, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, I assure you. M. R. F. having always in the clearest manner\r\nprovided (as he calls it) for his children by pre-arranging from the\r\nhour of the birth of each, and sometimes from an earlier period, what\r\nthe devoted little victim\xe2\x80\x99s calling and course in life should be, M. R.\r\nF. pre-arranged for myself that I was to be the barrister I am (with\r\nthe slight addition of an enormous practice, which has not accrued), and\r\nalso the married man I am not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first you have often told me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first I have often told you. Considering myself sufficiently\r\nincongruous on my legal eminence, I have until now suppressed my\r\ndomestic destiny. You know M. R. F., but not as well as I do. If you\r\nknew him as well as I do, he would amuse you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Filially spoken, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly so, believe me; and with every sentiment of affectionate\r\ndeference towards M. R. F. But if he amuses me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. When my\r\neldest brother was born, of course the rest of us knew (I mean the rest\r\nof us would have known, if we had been in existence) that he was heir\r\nto the Family Embarrassments--we call it before the company the Family\r\nEstate. But when my second brother was going to be born by-and-by,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis,\xe2\x80\x9d says M. R. F., \xe2\x80\x9cis a little pillar of the church.\xe2\x80\x9d Was born,\r\nand became a pillar of the church; a very shaky one. My third brother\r\nappeared, considerably in advance of his engagement to my mother; but\r\nM. R. F., not at all put out by surprise, instantly declared him\r\na Circumnavigator. Was pitch-forked into the Navy, but has not\r\ncircumnavigated. I announced myself and was disposed of with the highly\r\nsatisfactory results embodied before you. When my younger brother was\r\nhalf an hour old, it was settled by M. R. F. that he should have a\r\nmechanical genius. And so on. Therefore I say that M. R. F. amuses me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Touching the lady, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There M. R. F. ceases to be amusing, because my intentions are opposed\r\nto touching the lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better see her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mortimer, you have studied my character. Could I possibly go\r\ndown there, labelled \xe2\x80\x9cELIGIBLE. ON VIEW,\xe2\x80\x9d and meet the lady, similarly\r\nlabelled? Anything to carry out M. R. F.\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements, I am sure, with\r\nthe greatest pleasure--except matrimony. Could I possibly support it? I,\r\nso soon bored, so constantly, so fatally?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are not a consistent fellow, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In susceptibility to boredom,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that worthy, \xe2\x80\x98I assure you I am\r\nthe most consistent of mankind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, it was but now that you were dwelling in the advantages of a\r\nmonotony of two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a lighthouse. Do me the justice to remember the condition. In a\r\nlighthouse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer laughed again, and Eugene, having laughed too for the first\r\ntime, as if he found himself on reflection rather entertaining, relapsed\r\ninto his usual gloom, and drowsily said, as he enjoyed his cigar, \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nthere is no help for it; one of the prophetic deliveries of M. R. F.\r\nmust for ever remain unfulfilled. With every disposition to oblige him,\r\nhe must submit to a failure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt had grown darker as they talked, and the wind was sawing and the\r\nsawdust was whirling outside paler windows. The underlying churchyard\r\nwas already settling into deep dim shade, and the shade was creeping up\r\nto the housetops among which they sat. \xe2\x80\x98As if,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98as if the\r\nchurchyard ghosts were rising.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had walked to the window with his cigar in his mouth, to exalt its\r\nflavour by comparing the fireside with the outside, when he stopped\r\nmidway on his return to his arm-chair, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Apparently one of the ghosts has lost its way, and dropped in to be\r\ndirected. Look at this phantom!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood, whose back was towards the door, turned his head, and there,\r\nin the darkness of the entry, stood a something in the likeness of a\r\nman: to whom he addressed the not irrelevant inquiry, \xe2\x80\x98Who the devil are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ask your pardons, Governors,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the ghost, in a hoarse\r\ndouble-barrelled whisper, \xe2\x80\x98but might either on you be Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by not knocking at the door?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ask your pardons, Governors,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the ghost, as before, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nprobable you was not aware your door stood open.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHereunto the ghost again hoarsely replied, in its double-barrelled\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98I ask your pardons, Governors, but might one on you be Lawyer\r\nLightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of us is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the owner of that name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Governors Both,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the ghost, carefully closing the\r\nroom door; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99tickler business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer lighted the candles. They showed the visitor to be an\r\nill-looking visitor with a squinting leer, who, as he spoke, fumbled\r\nat an old sodden fur cap, formless and mangey, that looked like a furry\r\nanimal, dog or cat, puppy or kitten, drowned and decaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98what is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Governors Both,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man, in what he meant to be a wheedling\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x98which on you might be Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lawyer Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 ducking at him with a servile air, \xe2\x80\x98I am a man as\r\ngets my living, and as seeks to get my living, by the sweat of my brow.\r\nNot to risk being done out of the sweat of my brow, by any chances, I\r\nshould wish afore going further to be swore in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not a swearer in of people, man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe visitor, clearly anything but reliant on this assurance, doggedly\r\nmuttered \xe2\x80\x98Alfred David.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that your name?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man. \xe2\x80\x98No; I want to take a Alfred David.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Which Eugene, smoking and contemplating him, interpreted as meaning\r\nAffidavit.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you, my good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, with his indolent laugh,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I have nothing to do with swearing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can swear AT you,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene explained; \xe2\x80\x98and so can I. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nmore for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMuch discomfited by this information, the visitor turned the drowned\r\ndog or cat, puppy or kitten, about and about, and looked from one of\r\nthe Governors Both to the other of the Governors Both, while he deeply\r\nconsidered within himself. At length he decided:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I must be took down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. \xe2\x80\x98In pen and ink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First, let us know what your business is about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s about,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, taking a step forward, dropping his hoarse\r\nvoice, and shading it with his hand, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s about from five to ten\r\nthousand pound reward. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s about. It\xe2\x80\x99s about Murder. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat it\xe2\x80\x99s about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come nearer the table. Sit down. Will you have a glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man; \xe2\x80\x98and I don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive you, Governors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was given him. Making a stiff arm to the elbow, he poured the wine\r\ninto his mouth, tilted it into his right cheek, as saying, \xe2\x80\x98What do you\r\nthink of it?\xe2\x80\x99 tilted it into his left cheek, as saying, \xe2\x80\x98What do YOU\r\nthink of it?\xe2\x80\x99 jerked it into his stomach, as saying, \xe2\x80\x98What do YOU think\r\nof it?\xe2\x80\x99 To conclude, smacked his lips, as if all three replied, \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nthink well of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you have another?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I will,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated, \xe2\x80\x98and I don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive you, Governors.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nalso repeated the other proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 began Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, there you\xe2\x80\x99re rather fast, Lawyer Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, in a\r\nremonstrant manner. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Lawyer Lightwood? There you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nlittle bit fast. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to earn from five to ten thousand pound by\r\nthe sweat of my brow; and as a poor man doing justice to the sweat of my\r\nbrow, is it likely I can afford to part with so much as my name without\r\nits being took down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDeferring to the man\xe2\x80\x99s sense of the binding powers of pen and ink and\r\npaper, Lightwood nodded acceptance of Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s nodded proposal to take\r\nthose spells in hand. Eugene, bringing them to the table, sat down as\r\nclerk or notary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut further precaution was still due to the sweat of this honest\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should wish, Lawyer Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 he stipulated, \xe2\x80\x98to have that T\xe2\x80\x99other\r\nGovernor as my witness that what I said I said. Consequent, will the\r\nT\xe2\x80\x99other Governor be so good as chuck me his name and where he lives?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene, cigar in mouth and pen in hand, tossed him his card. After\r\nspelling it out slowly, the man made it into a little roll, and tied it\r\nup in an end of his neckerchief still more slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, for the third time, \xe2\x80\x98if you have quite completed\r\nyour various preparations, my friend, and have fully ascertained that\r\nyour spirits are cool and not in any way hurried, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Roger Riderhood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dwelling-place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lime\xe2\x80\x99us Hole.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Calling or occupation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot quite so glib with this answer as with the previous two, Mr\r\nRiderhood gave in the definition, \xe2\x80\x98Waterside character.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything against you?\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene quietly put in, as he wrote.\r\n\r\nRather baulked, Mr Riderhood evasively remarked, with an innocent air,\r\nthat he believed the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor had asked him summa\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ever in trouble?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once.\xe2\x80\x99 (Might happen to any man, Mr Riderhood added incidentally.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On suspicion of--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of seaman\xe2\x80\x99s pocket,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Whereby I was in reality the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, and tried to take care of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With the sweat of your brow?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Till it poured down like rain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Roger Riderhood.\r\n\r\nEugene leaned back in his chair, and smoked with his eyes negligently\r\nturned on the informer, and his pen ready to reduce him to more writing.\r\nLightwood also smoked, with his eyes negligently turned on the informer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now let me be took down again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, when he had turned the\r\ndrowned cap over and under, and had brushed it the wrong way (if it had\r\na right way) with his sleeve. \xe2\x80\x98I give information that the man that done\r\nthe Harmon Murder is Gaffer Hexam, the man that found the body. The hand\r\nof Jesse Hexam, commonly called Gaffer on the river and along shore, is\r\nthe hand that done that deed. His hand and no other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe two friends glanced at one another with more serious faces than they\r\nhad shown yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell us on what grounds you make this accusation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer\r\nLightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the grounds,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riderhood, wiping his face with his sleeve,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I was Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s pardner, and suspected of him many a long day and\r\nmany a dark night. On the grounds that I knowed his ways. On the grounds\r\nthat I broke the pardnership because I see the danger; which I warn you\r\nhis daughter may tell you another story about that, for anythink I can\r\nsay, but you know what it\xe2\x80\x99ll be worth, for she\xe2\x80\x99d tell you lies, the\r\nworld round and the heavens broad, to save her father. On the grounds\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s well understood along the cause\xe2\x80\x99ays and the stairs that he\r\ndone it. On the grounds that he\xe2\x80\x99s fell off from, because he done it. On\r\nthe grounds that I will swear he done it. On the grounds that you may\r\ntake me where you will, and get me sworn to it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to back out\r\nof the consequences. I have made up MY mind. Take me anywheres.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this is nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Riderhood, indignantly and amazedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Merely nothing. It goes to no more than that you suspect this man of\r\nthe crime. You may do so with some reason, or you may do so with no\r\nreason, but he cannot be convicted on your suspicion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I said--I appeal to the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor as my witness--haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI said from the first minute that I opened my mouth in this here\r\nworld-without-end-everlasting chair\xe2\x80\x99 (he evidently used that form of\r\nwords as next in force to an affidavit), \xe2\x80\x98that I was willing to swear\r\nthat he done it? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I said, Take me and get me sworn to it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nsay so now? You won\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely not; but you only offer to swear to your suspicion, and I tell\r\nyou it is not enough to swear to your suspicion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not enough, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99 he cautiously demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Positively not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And did I say it WAS enough? Now, I appeal to the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor.\r\nNow, fair! Did I say so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He certainly has not said that he had no more to tell,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene observed\r\nin a low voice without looking at him, \xe2\x80\x98whatever he seemed to imply.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the informer, triumphantly perceiving that the remark was\r\ngenerally in his favour, though apparently not closely understanding it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fort\xe2\x80\x99nate for me I had a witness!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98Say out what you have to say. No\r\nafter-thought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me be took down then!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the informer, eagerly and anxiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me be took down, for by George and the Draggin I\xe2\x80\x99m a coming to it\r\nnow! Don\xe2\x80\x99t do nothing to keep back from a honest man the fruits of the\r\nsweat of his brow! I give information, then, that he told me that he\r\ndone it. Is THAT enough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care what you say, my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lawyer Lightwood, take care, you, what I say; for I judge you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nanswerable for follering it up!\xe2\x80\x99 Then, slowly and emphatically beating\r\nit all out with his open right hand on the palm of his left; \xe2\x80\x98I,\r\nRoger Riderhood, Lime\xe2\x80\x99us Hole, Waterside character, tell you, Lawyer\r\nLightwood, that the man Jesse Hexam, commonly called upon the river and\r\nalong-shore Gaffer, told me that he done the deed. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, he told\r\nme with his own lips that he done the deed. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, he said that he\r\ndone the deed. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did he tell you so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Outside,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Riderhood, always beating it out, with his head\r\ndeterminedly set askew, and his eyes watchfully dividing their\r\nattention between his two auditors, \xe2\x80\x98outside the door of the Six Jolly\r\nFellowships, towards a quarter after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock at midnight--but I\r\nwill not in my conscience undertake to swear to so fine a matter as\r\nfive minutes--on the night when he picked up the body. The Six Jolly\r\nFellowships won\xe2\x80\x99t run away. If it turns out that he warn\xe2\x80\x99t at the Six\r\nJolly Fellowships that night at midnight, I\xe2\x80\x99m a liar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you (take me down, T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor, I ask no better). He\r\ncome out first; I come out last. I might be a minute arter him; I might\r\nbe half a minute, I might be a quarter of a minute; I cannot swear to\r\nthat, and therefore I won\xe2\x80\x99t. That\xe2\x80\x99s knowing the obligations of a Alfred\r\nDavid, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I found him a waiting to speak to me. He says to me, \xe2\x80\x9cRogue\r\nRiderhood\xe2\x80\x9d--for that\xe2\x80\x99s the name I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly called by--not for any\r\nmeaning in it, for meaning it has none, but because of its being similar\r\nto Roger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Scuse ME, Lawyer Lightwood, it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the truth, and as such I\r\ndo mind it, and I must mind it and I will mind it. \xe2\x80\x9cRogue Riderhood,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwords passed betwixt us on the river tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d Which they had;\r\nask his daughter! \xe2\x80\x9cI threatened you,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cto chop you over the\r\nfingers with my boat\xe2\x80\x99s stretcher, or take a aim at your brains with my\r\nboathook. I did so on accounts of your looking too hard at what I had in\r\ntow, as if you was suspicious, and on accounts of your holding on to the\r\ngunwale of my boat.\xe2\x80\x9d I says to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGaffer, I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d He says to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRogue Riderhood, you are a man in a dozen\xe2\x80\x9d--I think he said in a score,\r\nbut of that I am not positive, so take the lowest figure, for precious\r\nbe the obligations of a Alfred David. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen your\r\nfellow-men is up, be it their lives or be it their watches, sharp is\r\never the word with you. Had you suspicions?\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cGaffer, I had;\r\nand what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I have.\xe2\x80\x9d He falls a shaking, and he says, \xe2\x80\x9cOf what?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cOf foul play.\xe2\x80\x9d He falls a shaking worse, and he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThere WAS\r\nfoul play then. I done it for his money. Don\xe2\x80\x99t betray me!\xe2\x80\x9d Those were\r\nthe words as ever he used.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, broken only by the fall of the ashes in the grate.\r\nAn opportunity which the informer improved by smearing himself all\r\nover the head and neck and face with his drowned cap, and not at all\r\nimproving his own appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What more?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of him, d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean, Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of anything to the purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m blest if I understand you, Governors Both,\xe2\x80\x99 said the informer,\r\nin a creeping manner: propitiating both, though only one had spoken.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t THAT enough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ask him how he did it, where he did it, when he did it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Far be it from me, Lawyer Lightwood! I was so troubled in my mind, that\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have knowed more, no, not for the sum as I expect to earn\r\nfrom you by the sweat of my brow, twice told! I had put an end to the\r\npardnership. I had cut the connexion. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t undo what was done; and\r\nwhen he begs and prays, \xe2\x80\x9cOld pardner, on my knees, don\xe2\x80\x99t split upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I only makes answer \xe2\x80\x9cNever speak another word to Roger Riderhood, nor\r\nlook him in the face!\xe2\x80\x9d and I shuns that man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving given these words a swing to make them mount the higher and go\r\nthe further, Rogue Riderhood poured himself out another glass of wine\r\nunbidden, and seemed to chew it, as, with the half-emptied glass in his\r\nhand, he stared at the candles.\r\n\r\nMortimer glanced at Eugene, but Eugene sat glowering at his paper,\r\nand would give him no responsive glance. Mortimer again turned to the\r\ninformer, to whom he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been troubled in your mind a long time, man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGiving his wine a final chew, and swallowing it, the informer answered\r\nin a single word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hages!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When all that stir was made, when the Government reward was offered,\r\nwhen the police were on the alert, when the whole country rang with the\r\ncrime!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Riderhood very slowly and hoarsely chimed in, with several\r\nretrospective nods of his head. \xe2\x80\x98Warn\xe2\x80\x99t I troubled in my mind then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When conjecture ran wild, when the most extravagant suspicions were\r\nafloat, when half a dozen innocent people might have been laid by the\r\nheels any hour in the day!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, almost warming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Riderhood chimed in, as before. \xe2\x80\x98Warn\xe2\x80\x99t I troubled in my mind\r\nthrough it all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, drawing a lady\xe2\x80\x99s head upon his\r\nwriting-paper, and touching it at intervals, \xe2\x80\x98the opportunity then of\r\nearning so much money, you see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor hits the nail, Lawyer Lightwood! It was that as\r\nturned me. I had many times and again struggled to relieve myself of the\r\ntrouble on my mind, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it off. I had once very nigh\r\ngot it off to Miss Abbey Potterson which keeps the Six Jolly\r\nFellowships--there is the \xe2\x80\x98ouse, it won\xe2\x80\x99t run away,--there lives the\r\nlady, she ain\xe2\x80\x99t likely to be struck dead afore you get there--ask\r\nher!--but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. At last, out comes the new bill with your\r\nown lawful name, Lawyer Lightwood, printed to it, and then I asks the\r\nquestion of my own intellects, Am I to have this trouble on my mind for\r\never? Am I never to throw it off? Am I always to think more of Gaffer\r\nthan of my own self? If he\xe2\x80\x99s got a daughter, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I got a daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And echo answered--?\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYou have,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood, in a firm tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Incidentally mentioning, at the same time, her age?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, governor. Two-and-twenty last October. And then I put it to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x9cRegarding the money. It is a pot of money.\xe2\x80\x9d For it IS a pot,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr Riderhood, with candour, \xe2\x80\x98and why deny it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear!\xe2\x80\x99 from Eugene as he touched his drawing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pot of money; but is it a sin for a labouring man that\r\nmoistens every crust of bread he earns, with his tears--or if not with\r\nthem, with the colds he catches in his head--is it a sin for that man to\r\nearn it? Say there is anything again earning it.\xe2\x80\x9d This I put to myself\r\nstrong, as in duty bound; \xe2\x80\x9chow can it be said without blaming Lawyer\r\nLightwood for offering it to be earned?\xe2\x80\x9d And was it for ME to blame\r\nLawyer Lightwood? No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not, Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Riderhood acquiesced. \xe2\x80\x98So I made up my\r\nmind to get my trouble off my mind, and to earn by the sweat of my brow\r\nwhat was held out to me. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, suddenly turning\r\nbloodthirsty, \xe2\x80\x98I mean to have it! And now I tell you, once and away,\r\nLawyer Lightwood, that Jesse Hexam, commonly called Gaffer, his hand and\r\nno other, done the deed, on his own confession to me. And I give him up\r\nto you, and I want him took. This night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter another silence, broken only by the fall of the ashes in the\r\ngrate, which attracted the informer\xe2\x80\x99s attention as if it were the\r\nchinking of money, Mortimer Lightwood leaned over his friend, and said\r\nin a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I must go with this fellow to our imperturbable friend at the\r\npolice-station.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98there is no help for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you believe him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe him to be a thorough rascal. But he may tell the truth, for\r\nhis own purpose, and for this occasion only.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98HE doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98But neither is his late partner, whom he\r\ndenounces, a prepossessing person. The firm are cut-throat Shepherds\r\nboth, in appearance. I should like to ask him one thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe subject of this conference sat leering at the ashes, trying with\r\nall his might to overhear what was said, but feigning abstraction as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Governors Both\xe2\x80\x99 glanced at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mentioned (twice, I think) a daughter of this Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nEugene, aloud. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply that she had any guilty\r\nknowledge of the crime?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe honest man, after considering--perhaps considering how his answer\r\nmight affect the fruits of the sweat of his brow--replied, unreservedly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you implicate no other person?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It ain\xe2\x80\x99t what I implicate, it\xe2\x80\x99s what Gaffer implicated,\xe2\x80\x99 was the dogged\r\nand determined answer. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know more than that his words\r\nto me was, \xe2\x80\x9cI done it.\xe2\x80\x9d Those was his words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must see this out, Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Eugene, rising. \xe2\x80\x98How shall we\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us walk,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98and give this fellow time to think\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving exchanged the question and answer, they prepared themselves\r\nfor going out, and Mr Riderhood rose. While extinguishing the candles,\r\nLightwood, quite as a matter of course took up the glass from which that\r\nhonest gentleman had drunk, and coolly tossed it under the grate, where\r\nit fell shivering into fragments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, if you will take the lead,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn and I\r\nwill follow. You know where to go, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose I do, Lawyer Lightwood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take the lead, then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe waterside character pulled his drowned cap over his ears with both\r\nhands, and making himself more round-shouldered than nature had made\r\nhim, by the sullen and persistent slouch with which he went, went\r\ndown the stairs, round by the Temple Church, across the Temple into\r\nWhitefriars, and so on by the waterside streets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at his hang-dog air,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, following.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It strikes me rather as a hang-MAN air,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98He has\r\nundeniable intentions that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey said little else as they followed. He went on before them as an\r\nugly Fate might have done, and they kept him in view, and would have\r\nbeen glad enough to lose sight of him. But on he went before them,\r\nalways at the same distance, and the same rate. Aslant against the hard\r\nimplacable weather and the rough wind, he was no more to be driven back\r\nthan hurried forward, but held on like an advancing Destiny. There came,\r\nwhen they were about midway on their journey, a heavy rush of hail,\r\nwhich in a few minutes pelted the streets clear, and whitened them. It\r\nmade no difference to him. A man\xe2\x80\x99s life being to be taken and the price\r\nof it got, the hailstones to arrest the purpose must lie larger and\r\ndeeper than those. He crashed through them, leaving marks in the\r\nfast-melting slush that were mere shapeless holes; one might have\r\nfancied, following, that the very fashion of humanity had departed from\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nThe blast went by, and the moon contended with the fast-flying clouds,\r\nand the wild disorder reigning up there made the pitiful little tumults\r\nin the streets of no account. It was not that the wind swept all\r\nthe brawlers into places of shelter, as it had swept the hail still\r\nlingering in heaps wherever there was refuge for it; but that it seemed\r\nas if the streets were absorbed by the sky, and the night were all in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he has had time to think of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98he has not had time to\r\nthink better of it--or differently of it, if that\xe2\x80\x99s better. There is no\r\nsign of drawing back in him; and as I recollect this place, we must be\r\nclose upon the corner where we alighted that night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn fact, a few abrupt turns brought them to the river side, where they\r\nhad slipped about among the stones, and where they now slipped more; the\r\nwind coming against them in slants and flaws, across the tide and the\r\nwindings of the river, in a furious way. With that habit of getting\r\nunder the lee of any shelter which waterside characters acquire, the\r\nwaterside character at present in question led the way to the leeside of\r\nthe Six Jolly Fellowship Porters before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look round here, Lawyer Lightwood, at them red curtains. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nFellowships, the \xe2\x80\x98ouse as I told you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run away. And has it run\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot showing himself much impressed by this remarkable confirmation of\r\nthe informer\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, Lightwood inquired what other business they had\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wished you to see the Fellowships for yourself, Lawyer Lightwood,\r\nthat you might judge whether I\xe2\x80\x99m a liar; and now I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindow for myself, that we may know whether he\xe2\x80\x99s at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that, he crept away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! and go through with it,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Eugene.\r\n\r\nHe came back after a very short interval indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s out, and his boat\xe2\x80\x99s out. His daughter\xe2\x80\x99s at home, sitting\r\na-looking at the fire. But there\xe2\x80\x99s some supper getting ready, so\r\nGaffer\xe2\x80\x99s expected. I can find what move he\xe2\x80\x99s upon, easy enough,\r\npresently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he beckoned and led the way again, and they came to the\r\npolice-station, still as clean and cool and steady as before, saving\r\nthat the flame of its lamp--being but a lamp-flame, and only attached to\r\nthe Force as an outsider--flickered in the wind.\r\n\r\nAlso, within doors, Mr Inspector was at his studies as of yore.\r\nHe recognized the friends the instant they reappeared, but their\r\nreappearance had no effect on his composure. Not even the circumstance\r\nthat Riderhood was their conductor moved him, otherwise than that as he\r\ntook a dip of ink he seemed, by a settlement of his chin in his stock,\r\nto propound to that personage, without looking at him, the question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have YOU been up to, last?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer Lightwood asked him, would he be so good as look at those\r\nnotes? Handing him Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHaving read the first few lines, Mr Inspector mounted to that (for him)\r\nextraordinary pitch of emotion that he said, \xe2\x80\x98Does either of you two\r\ngentlemen happen to have a pinch of snuff about him?\xe2\x80\x99 Finding that\r\nneither had, he did quite as well without it, and read on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard these read?\xe2\x80\x99 he then demanded of the honest man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you had better hear them.\xe2\x80\x99 And so read them aloud, in an official\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are these notes correct, now, as to the information you bring here and\r\nthe evidence you mean to give?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, when he had finished reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are. They are as correct,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98as I am. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say more than that for \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this man myself, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector to Lightwood. Then\r\nto Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98Is he at home? Where is he? What\xe2\x80\x99s he doing? You have\r\nmade it your business to know all about him, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood said what he did know, and promised to find out in a few\r\nminutes what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector; \xe2\x80\x98not till I tell you: We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t look like\r\nbusiness. Would you two gentlemen object to making a pretence of taking\r\na glass of something in my company at the Fellowships? Well-conducted\r\nhouse, and highly respectable landlady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey replied that they would be happy to substitute a reality for the\r\npretence, which, in the main, appeared to be as one with Mr Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, taking his hat from its peg, and putting a pair of\r\nhandcuffs in his pocket as if they were his gloves. \xe2\x80\x98Reserve!\xe2\x80\x99 Reserve\r\nsaluted. \xe2\x80\x98You know where to find me?\xe2\x80\x99 Reserve again saluted. \xe2\x80\x98Riderhood,\r\nwhen you have found out concerning his coming home, come round to the\r\nwindow of Cosy, tap twice at it, and wait for me. Now, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the three went out together, and Riderhood slouched off from under\r\nthe trembling lamp his separate way, Lightwood asked the officer what he\r\nthought of this?\r\n\r\nMr Inspector replied, with due generality and reticence, that it was\r\nalways more likely that a man had done a bad thing than that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThat he himself had several times \xe2\x80\x98reckoned up\xe2\x80\x99 Gaffer, but had never\r\nbeen able to bring him to a satisfactory criminal total. That if this\r\nstory was true, it was only in part true. That the two men, very shy\r\ncharacters, would have been jointly and pretty equally \xe2\x80\x98in it;\xe2\x80\x99 but that\r\nthis man had \xe2\x80\x98spotted\xe2\x80\x99 the other, to save himself and get the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I think,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr Inspector, in conclusion, \xe2\x80\x98that if all goes\r\nwell with him, he\xe2\x80\x99s in a tolerable way of getting it. But as this is the\r\nFellowships, gentlemen, where the lights are, I recommend dropping\r\nthe subject. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do better than be interested in some lime works\r\nanywhere down about Northfleet, and doubtful whether some of your lime\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get into bad company as it comes up in barges.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You hear Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98You are deeply\r\ninterested in lime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Without lime,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that unmoved barrister-at-law, \xe2\x80\x98my existence\r\nwould be unilluminated by a ray of hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nTRACKING THE BIRD OF PREY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two lime merchants, with their escort, entered the dominions of\r\nMiss Abbey Potterson, to whom their escort (presenting them and their\r\npretended business over the half-door of the bar, in a confidential\r\nway) preferred his figurative request that \xe2\x80\x98a mouthful of fire\xe2\x80\x99 might\r\nbe lighted in Cosy. Always well disposed to assist the constituted\r\nauthorities, Miss Abbey bade Bob Gliddery attend the gentlemen to\r\nthat retreat, and promptly enliven it with fire and gaslight. Of this\r\ncommission the bare-armed Bob, leading the way with a flaming wisp of\r\npaper, so speedily acquitted himself, that Cosy seemed to leap out of a\r\ndark sleep and embrace them warmly, the moment they passed the lintels\r\nof its hospitable door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They burn sherry very well here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, as a piece of\r\nlocal intelligence. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you gentlemen might like a bottle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe answer being By all means, Bob Gliddery received his instructions\r\nfrom Mr Inspector, and departed in a becoming state of alacrity\r\nengendered by reverence for the majesty of the law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a certain fact,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98that this man we have\r\nreceived our information from,\xe2\x80\x99 indicating Riderhood with his thumb over\r\nhis shoulder, \xe2\x80\x98has for some time past given the other man a bad name\r\narising out of your lime barges, and that the other man has been avoided\r\nin consequence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say what it means or proves, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a certain\r\nfact. I had it first from one of the opposite sex of my acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvaguely indicating Miss Abbey with his thumb over his shoulder, \xe2\x80\x98down\r\naway at a distance, over yonder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen probably Mr Inspector was not quite unprepared for their visit that\r\nevening? Lightwood hinted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well you see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98it was a question of making a move.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s of no use moving if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your move is. You had\r\nbetter by far keep still. In the matter of this lime, I certainly had\r\nan idea that it might lie betwixt the two men; I always had that idea.\r\nStill I was forced to wait for a start, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky as to get\r\na start. This man that we have received our information from, has got\r\na start, and if he don\xe2\x80\x99t meet with a check he may make the running and\r\ncome in first. There may turn out to be something considerable for him\r\nthat comes in second, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mention who may or who may not try\r\nfor that place. There\xe2\x80\x99s duty to do, and I shall do it, under any\r\ncircumstances; to the best of my judgment and ability.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speaking as a shipper of lime--\xe2\x80\x99 began Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which no man has a better right to do than yourself, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nInspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98my father having been a shipper of lime\r\nbefore me, and my grandfather before him--in fact we having been a\r\nfamily immersed to the crowns of our heads in lime during several\r\ngenerations--I beg to observe that if this missing lime could be got\r\nhold of without any young female relative of any distinguished gentleman\r\nengaged in the lime trade (which I cherish next to my life) being\r\npresent, I think it might be a more agreeable proceeding to the\r\nassisting bystanders, that is to say, lime-burners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I also,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, pushing his friend aside with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x98should\r\nmuch prefer that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It shall be done, gentlemen, if it can be done conveniently,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr Inspector, with coolness. \xe2\x80\x98There is no wish on my part to cause any\r\ndistress in that quarter. Indeed, I am sorry for that quarter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was a boy in that quarter,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98He is still there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98He has quitted those works. He is otherwise\r\ndisposed of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will she be left alone then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will be left,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBob\xe2\x80\x99s reappearance with a steaming jug broke off the conversation. But\r\nalthough the jug steamed forth a delicious perfume, its contents had not\r\nreceived that last happy touch which the surpassing finish of the Six\r\nJolly Fellowship Porters imparted on such momentous occasions. Bob\r\ncarried in his left hand one of those iron models of sugar-loaf hats,\r\nbefore mentioned, into which he emptied the jug, and the pointed end of\r\nwhich he thrust deep down into the fire, so leaving it for a few moments\r\nwhile he disappeared and reappeared with three bright drinking-glasses.\r\nPlacing these on the table and bending over the fire, meritoriously\r\nsensible of the trying nature of his duty, he watched the wreaths of\r\nsteam, until at the special instant of projection he caught up the iron\r\nvessel and gave it one delicate twirl, causing it to send forth one\r\ngentle hiss. Then he restored the contents to the jug; held over the\r\nsteam of the jug, each of the three bright glasses in succession;\r\nfinally filled them all, and with a clear conscience awaited the\r\napplause of his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nIt was bestowed (Mr Inspector having proposed as an appropriate\r\nsentiment \xe2\x80\x98The lime trade!\xe2\x80\x99) and Bob withdrew to report the\r\ncommendations of the guests to Miss Abbey in the bar. It may be here\r\nin confidence admitted that, the room being close shut in his absence,\r\nthere had not appeared to be the slightest reason for the elaborate\r\nmaintenance of this same lime fiction. Only it had been regarded by Mr\r\nInspector as so uncommonly satisfactory, and so fraught with mysterious\r\nvirtues, that neither of his clients had presumed to question it.\r\n\r\nTwo taps were now heard on the outside of the window. Mr Inspector,\r\nhastily fortifying himself with another glass, strolled out with a\r\nnoiseless foot and an unoccupied countenance. As one might go to survey\r\nthe weather and the general aspect of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is becoming grim, Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor I\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98Shall we go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Being here, let us stay. You ought to see it out, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nyou. Besides, that lonely girl with the dark hair runs in my head. It\r\nwas little more than a glimpse we had of her that last time, and yet\r\nI almost see her waiting by the fire to-night. Do you feel like a dark\r\ncombination of traitor and pickpocket when you think of that girl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98Do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very much so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir escort strolled back again, and reported. Divested of its various\r\nlime-lights and shadows, his report went to the effect that Gaffer was\r\naway in his boat, supposed to be on his old look-out; that he had been\r\nexpected last high-water; that having missed it for some reason or\r\nother, he was not, according to his usual habits at night, to be counted\r\non before next high-water, or it might be an hour or so later; that his\r\ndaughter, surveyed through the window, would seem to be so expecting\r\nhim, for the supper was not cooking, but set out ready to be cooked;\r\nthat it would be high-water at about one, and that it was now barely\r\nten; that there was nothing to be done but watch and wait; that the\r\ninformer was keeping watch at the instant of that present reporting, but\r\nthat two heads were better than one (especially when the second was\r\nMr Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s); and that the reporter meant to share the watch. And\r\nforasmuch as crouching under the lee of a hauled-up boat on a night when\r\nit blew cold and strong, and when the weather was varied with blasts of\r\nhail at times, might be wearisome to amateurs, the reporter closed with\r\nthe recommendation that the two gentlemen should remain, for a while at\r\nany rate, in their present quarters, which were weather-tight and warm.\r\n\r\nThey were not inclined to dispute this recommendation, but they wanted\r\nto know where they could join the watchers when so disposed. Rather than\r\ntrust to a verbal description of the place, which might mislead, Eugene\r\n(with a less weighty sense of personal trouble on him than he usually\r\nhad) would go out with Mr Inspector, note the spot, and come back.\r\n\r\nOn the shelving bank of the river, among the slimy stones of a\r\ncauseway--not the special causeway of the Six Jolly Fellowships, which\r\nhad a landing-place of its own, but another, a little removed, and\r\nvery near to the old windmill which was the denounced man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndwelling-place--were a few boats; some, moored and already beginning to\r\nfloat; others, hauled up above the reach of the tide. Under one of these\r\nlatter, Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s companion disappeared. And when Eugene had observed its\r\nposition with reference to the other boats, and had made sure that he\r\ncould not miss it, he turned his eyes upon the building where, as he had\r\nbeen told, the lonely girl with the dark hair sat by the fire.\r\n\r\nHe could see the light of the fire shining through the window. Perhaps\r\nit drew him on to look in. Perhaps he had come out with the express\r\nintention. That part of the bank having rank grass growing on it, there\r\nwas no difficulty in getting close, without any noise of footsteps: it\r\nwas but to scramble up a ragged face of pretty hard mud some three or\r\nfour feet high and come upon the grass and to the window. He came to the\r\nwindow by that means.\r\n\r\nShe had no other light than the light of the fire. The unkindled lamp\r\nstood on the table. She sat on the ground, looking at the brazier, with\r\nher face leaning on her hand. There was a kind of film or flicker on\r\nher face, which at first he took to be the fitful firelight; but, on a\r\nsecond look, he saw that she was weeping. A sad and solitary spectacle,\r\nas shown him by the rising and the falling of the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a little window of but four pieces of glass, and was not\r\ncurtained; he chose it because the larger window near it was. It showed\r\nhim the room, and the bills upon the wall respecting the drowned people\r\nstarting out and receding by turns. But he glanced slightly at them,\r\nthough he looked long and steadily at her. A deep rich piece of colour,\r\nwith the brown flush of her cheek and the shining lustre of her hair,\r\nthough sad and solitary, weeping by the rising and the falling of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nShe started up. He had been so very still that he felt sure it was not\r\nhe who had disturbed her, so merely withdrew from the window and stood\r\nnear it in the shadow of the wall. She opened the door, and said in an\r\nalarmed tone, \xe2\x80\x98Father, was that you calling me?\xe2\x80\x99 And again, \xe2\x80\x98Father!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd once again, after listening, \xe2\x80\x98Father! I thought I heard you call me\r\ntwice before!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo response. As she re-entered at the door, he dropped over the bank and\r\nmade his way back, among the ooze and near the hiding-place, to Mortimer\r\nLightwood: to whom he told what he had seen of the girl, and how this\r\nwas becoming very grim indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If the real man feels as guilty as I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98he is\r\nremarkably uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Influence of secrecy,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not at all obliged to it for making me Guy Fawkes in the vault and\r\na Sneak in the area both at once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98Give me some more of\r\nthat stuff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood helped him to some more of that stuff, but it had been\r\ncooling, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pooh,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, spitting it out among the ashes. \xe2\x80\x98Tastes like the\r\nwash of the river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you so familiar with the flavour of the wash of the river?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I seem to be to-night. I feel as if I had been half drowned, and\r\nswallowing a gallon of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Influence of locality,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are mighty learned to-night, you and your influences,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nEugene. \xe2\x80\x98How long shall we stay here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I could choose, I should say a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98for the\r\nJolly Fellowship Porters are not the jolliest dogs I have known. But\r\nI suppose we are best here until they turn us out with the other\r\nsuspicious characters, at midnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereupon he stirred the fire, and sat down on one side of it. It struck\r\neleven, and he made believe to compose himself patiently. But gradually\r\nhe took the fidgets in one leg, and then in the other leg, and then in\r\none arm, and then in the other arm, and then in his chin, and then in\r\nhis back, and then in his forehead, and then in his hair, and then in\r\nhis nose; and then he stretched himself recumbent on two chairs, and\r\ngroaned; and then he started up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Invisible insects of diabolical activity swarm in this place. I am\r\ntickled and twitched all over. Mentally, I have now committed a burglary\r\nunder the meanest circumstances, and the myrmidons of justice are at my\r\nheels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am quite as bad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, sitting up facing him, with a\r\ntumbled head; after going through some wonderful evolutions, in which\r\nhis head had been the lowest part of him. \xe2\x80\x98This restlessness began with\r\nme, long ago. All the time you were out, I felt like Gulliver with the\r\nLilliputians firing upon him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t do, Mortimer. We must get into the air; we must join our dear\r\nfriend and brother, Riderhood. And let us tranquillize ourselves by\r\nmaking a compact. Next time (with a view to our peace of mind) we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncommit the crime, instead of taking the criminal. You swear it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sworn! Let Tippins look to it. Her life\xe2\x80\x99s in danger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer rang the bell to pay the score, and Bob appeared to transact\r\nthat business with him: whom Eugene, in his careless extravagance, asked\r\nif he would like a situation in the lime-trade?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee sir, no sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve a good sitiwation here, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you change your mind at any time,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98come to me at\r\nmy works, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll always find an opening in the lime-kiln.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is my partner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98who keeps the books and attends to\r\nthe wages. A fair day\xe2\x80\x99s wages for a fair day\xe2\x80\x99s work is ever my partner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmotto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a very good \xe2\x80\x98un it is, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bob, receiving his fee, and\r\ndrawing a bow out of his head with his right hand, very much as he would\r\nhave drawn a pint of beer out of the beer engine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer apostrophized him, laughing quite heartily when they\r\nwere alone again, \xe2\x80\x98how CAN you be so ridiculous?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am in a ridiculous humour,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98I am a ridiculous fellow.\r\nEverything is ridiculous. Come along!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt passed into Mortimer Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s mind that a change of some sort,\r\nbest expressed perhaps as an intensification of all that was wildest and\r\nmost negligent and reckless in his friend, had come upon him in the last\r\nhalf-hour or so. Thoroughly used to him as he was, he found something\r\nnew and strained in him that was for the moment perplexing. This passed\r\ninto his mind, and passed out again; but he remembered it afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s where she sits, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, when they were standing\r\nunder the bank, roared and riven at by the wind. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the light of\r\nher fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a peep through the window,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene caught him by the arm. \xe2\x80\x98Best, not make a show of\r\nher. Come to our honest friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe led him to the post of watch, and they both dropped down and crept\r\nunder the lee of the boat; a better shelter than it had seemed before,\r\nbeing directly contrasted with the blowing wind and the bare night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Inspector at home?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And our friend of the perspiring brow is at the far corner there? Good.\r\nAnything happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His daughter has been out, thinking she heard him calling, unless it\r\nwas a sign to him to keep out of the way. It might have been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It might have been Rule Britannia,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nMortimer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 (On the other side of Mr Inspector.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two burglaries now, and a forgery!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this indication of his depressed state of mind, Eugene fell silent.\r\n\r\nThey were all silent for a long while. As it got to be flood-tide, and\r\nthe water came nearer to them, noises on the river became more frequent,\r\nand they listened more. To the turning of steam-paddles, to the clinking\r\nof iron chain, to the creaking of blocks, to the measured working\r\nof oars, to the occasional violent barking of some passing dog on\r\nshipboard, who seemed to scent them lying in their hiding-place. The\r\nnight was not so dark but that, besides the lights at bows and mastheads\r\ngliding to and fro, they could discern some shadowy bulk attached; and\r\nnow and then a ghostly lighter with a large dark sail, like a warning\r\narm, would start up very near them, pass on, and vanish. At this time\r\nof their watch, the water close to them would be often agitated by some\r\nimpulsion given it from a distance. Often they believed this beat and\r\nplash to be the boat they lay in wait for, running in ashore; and again\r\nand again they would have started up, but for the immobility with which\r\nthe informer, well used to the river, kept quiet in his place.\r\n\r\nThe wind carried away the striking of the great multitude of city\r\nchurch clocks, for those lay to leeward of them; but there were bells to\r\nwindward that told them of its being One--Two--Three. Without that aid\r\nthey would have known how the night wore, by the falling of the tide,\r\nrecorded in the appearance of an ever-widening black wet strip of shore,\r\nand the emergence of the paved causeway from the river, foot by foot.\r\n\r\nAs the time so passed, this slinking business became a more and more\r\nprecarious one. It would seem as if the man had had some intimation of\r\nwhat was in hand against him, or had taken fright? His movements might\r\nhave been planned to gain for him, in getting beyond their reach, twelve\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 advantage? The honest man who had expended the sweat of his brow\r\nbecame uneasy, and began to complain with bitterness of the proneness of\r\nmankind to cheat him--him invested with the dignity of Labour!\r\n\r\nTheir retreat was so chosen that while they could watch the river, they\r\ncould watch the house. No one had passed in or out, since the daughter\r\nthought she heard the father calling. No one could pass in or out\r\nwithout being seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it will be light at five,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98and then WE shall be\r\nseen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98what do you say to this? He may have\r\nbeen lurking in and out, and just holding his own betwixt two or three\r\nbridges, for hours back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you make of that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. Stoical, but\r\ncontradictory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He may be doing so at this present time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you make of that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My boat\xe2\x80\x99s among them boats here at the cause\xe2\x80\x99ay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you make of your boat?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What if I put off in her and take a look round? I know his ways, and\r\nthe likely nooks he favours. I know where he\xe2\x80\x99d be at such a time of the\r\ntide, and where he\xe2\x80\x99d be at such another time. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I been his pardner?\r\nNone of you need show. None of you need stir. I can shove her off\r\nwithout help; and as to me being seen, I\xe2\x80\x99m about at all times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might have given a worse opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, after brief\r\nconsideration. \xe2\x80\x98Try it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a bit. Let\xe2\x80\x99s work it out. If I want you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop round under the\r\nFellowships and tip you a whistle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I might so far presume as to offer a suggestion to my honourable and\r\ngallant friend, whose knowledge of naval matters far be it from me to\r\nimpeach,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene struck in with great deliberation, \xe2\x80\x98it would be, that\r\nto tip a whistle is to advertise mystery and invite speculation.\r\nMy honourable and gallant friend will, I trust, excuse me, as an\r\nindependent member, for throwing out a remark which I feel to be due to\r\nthis house and the country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was that the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor, or Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riderhood.\r\nFor, they spoke as they crouched or lay, without seeing one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In reply to the question put by my honourable and gallant friend,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Eugene, who was lying on his back with his hat on his face, as an\r\nattitude highly expressive of watchfulness, \xe2\x80\x98I can have no hesitation in\r\nreplying (it not being inconsistent with the public service) that those\r\naccents were the accents of the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve tolerable good eyes, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Governor? You\xe2\x80\x99ve all tolerable\r\ngood eyes, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded the informer.\r\n\r\nAll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then if I row up under the Fellowship and lay there, no need to\r\nwhistle. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make out that there\xe2\x80\x99s a speck of something or another\r\nthere, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll know it\xe2\x80\x99s me, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll come down that cause\xe2\x80\x99ay to\r\nme. Understood all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUnderstood all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Off she goes then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a moment, with the wind cutting keenly at him sideways, he was\r\nstaggering down to his boat; in a few moments he was clear, and creeping\r\nup the river under their own shore.\r\n\r\nEugene had raised himself on his elbow to look into the darkness after\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98I wish the boat of my honourable and gallant friend,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured,\r\nlying down again and speaking into his hat, \xe2\x80\x98may be endowed\r\nwith philanthropy enough to turn bottom-upward and extinguish\r\nhim!--Mortimer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My honourable friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three burglaries, two forgeries, and a midnight assassination.\xe2\x80\x99 Yet\r\nin spite of having those weights on his conscience, Eugene was somewhat\r\nenlivened by the late slight change in the circumstances of affairs. So\r\nwere his two companions. Its being a change was everything. The suspense\r\nseemed to have taken a new lease, and to have begun afresh from a recent\r\ndate. There was something additional to look for. They were all three\r\nmore sharply on the alert, and less deadened by the miserable influences\r\nof the place and time.\r\n\r\nMore than an hour had passed, and they were even dozing, when one of the\r\nthree--each said it was he, and he had NOT dozed--made out Riderhood\r\nin his boat at the spot agreed on. They sprang up, came out from their\r\nshelter, and went down to him. When he saw them coming, he dropped\r\nalongside the causeway; so that they, standing on the causeway, could\r\nspeak with him in whispers, under the shadowy mass of the Six Jolly\r\nFellowship Porters fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blest if I can make it out!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, staring at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Make what out? Have you seen him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What HAVE you seen?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood. For, he was staring at them in\r\nthe strangest way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his boat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not empty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, empty. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,--adrift. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,--with one scull\r\ngone. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,--with t\xe2\x80\x99other scull jammed in the thowels and\r\nbroke short off. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,--the boat\xe2\x80\x99s drove tight by the tide\r\n\xe2\x80\x98atwixt two tiers of barges. And what\xe2\x80\x99s more,--he\xe2\x80\x99s in luck again, by\r\nGeorge if he ain\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nTHE BIRD OF PREY BROUGHT DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nCold on the shore, in the raw cold of that leaden crisis in the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours when the vital force of all the noblest and\r\nprettiest things that live is at its lowest, the three watchers looked\r\neach at the blank faces of the other two, and all at the blank face of\r\nRiderhood in his boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s boat, Gaffer in luck again, and yet no Gaffer!\xe2\x80\x99 So spake\r\nRiderhood, staring disconsolate.\r\n\r\nAs if with one accord, they all turned their eyes towards the light of\r\nthe fire shining through the window. It was fainter and duller. Perhaps\r\nfire, like the higher animal and vegetable life it helps to sustain, has\r\nits greatest tendency towards death, when the night is dying and the day\r\nis not yet born.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it was me that had the law of this here job in hand,\xe2\x80\x99 growled\r\nRiderhood with a threatening shake of his head, \xe2\x80\x98blest if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lay\r\nhold of HER, at any rate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, but it is not you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. With something so suddenly fierce\r\nin him that the informer returned submissively; \xe2\x80\x98Well, well, well,\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other governor, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was. A man may speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And vermin may be silent,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, you\r\nwater-rat!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAstonished by his friend\xe2\x80\x99s unusual heat, Lightwood stared too, and then\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98What can have become of this man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. Unless he dived overboard.\xe2\x80\x99 The informer wiped his\r\nbrow ruefully as he said it, sitting in his boat and always staring\r\ndisconsolate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you make his boat fast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s fast enough till the tide runs back. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make her faster\r\nthan she is. Come aboard of mine, and see for your own-selves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a little backwardness in complying, for the freight looked too\r\nmuch for the boat; but on Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s protesting \xe2\x80\x98that he had had half a\r\ndozen, dead and alive, in her afore now, and she was nothing deep in the\r\nwater nor down in the stern even then, to speak of;\xe2\x80\x99 they carefully took\r\ntheir places, and trimmed the crazy thing. While they were doing so,\r\nRiderhood still sat staring disconsolate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right. Give way!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give way, by George!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Riderhood, before shoving off. \xe2\x80\x98If he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone and made off any how Lawyer Lightwood, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make me give\r\nway in a different manner. But he always WAS a cheat, con-found him!\r\nHe always was a infernal cheat, was Gaffer. Nothing straightfor\xe2\x80\x99ard,\r\nnothing on the square. So mean, so underhanded. Never going through with\r\na thing, nor carrying it out like a man!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hallo! Steady!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Eugene (he had recovered immediately on\r\nembarking), as they bumped heavily against a pile; and then in a lower\r\nvoice reversed his late apostrophe by remarking [\xe2\x80\x98I wish the boat of my\r\nhonourable and gallant friend may be endowed with philanthropy enough\r\nnot to turn bottom-upward and extinguish us!) Steady, steady! Sit close,\r\nMortimer. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the hail again. See how it flies, like a troop of wild\r\ncats, at Mr Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s eyes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIndeed he had the full benefit of it, and it so mauled him, though he\r\nbent his head low and tried to present nothing but the mangy cap to it,\r\nthat he dropped under the lee of a tier of shipping, and they lay there\r\nuntil it was over. The squall had come up, like a spiteful messenger\r\nbefore the morning; there followed in its wake a ragged tear of light\r\nwhich ripped the dark clouds until they showed a great grey hole of day.\r\n\r\nThey were all shivering, and everything about them seemed to be\r\nshivering; the river itself; craft, rigging, sails, such early smoke as\r\nthere yet was on the shore. Black with wet, and altered to the eye by\r\nwhite patches of hail and sleet, the huddled buildings looked lower\r\nthan usual, as if they were cowering, and had shrunk with the cold. Very\r\nlittle life was to be seen on either bank, windows and doors were shut,\r\nand the staring black and white letters upon wharves and warehouses\r\n\xe2\x80\x98looked,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene to Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98like inscriptions over the graves of\r\ndead businesses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs they glided slowly on, keeping under the shore and sneaking in and\r\nout among the shipping by back-alleys of water, in a pilfering way\r\nthat seemed to be their boatman\xe2\x80\x99s normal manner of progression, all\r\nthe objects among which they crept were so huge in contrast with their\r\nwretched boat, as to threaten to crush it. Not a ship\xe2\x80\x99s hull, with its\r\nrusty iron links of cable run out of hawse-holes long discoloured with\r\nthe iron\xe2\x80\x99s rusty tears, but seemed to be there with a fell intention.\r\nNot a figure-head but had the menacing look of bursting forward to run\r\nthem down. Not a sluice gate, or a painted scale upon a post or wall,\r\nshowing the depth of water, but seemed to hint, like the dreadfully\r\nfacetious Wolf in bed in Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s to drown YOU in,\r\nmy dears!\xe2\x80\x99 Not a lumbering black barge, with its cracked and blistered\r\nside impending over them, but seemed to suck at the river with a\r\nthirst for sucking them under. And everything so vaunted the spoiling\r\ninfluences of water--discoloured copper, rotten wood, honey-combed\r\nstone, green dank deposit--that the after-consequences of being crushed,\r\nsucked under, and drawn down, looked as ugly to the imagination as the\r\nmain event.\r\n\r\nSome half-hour of this work, and Riderhood unshipped his sculls, stood\r\nholding on to a barge, and hand over hand long-wise along the barge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside gradually worked his boat under her head into a secret little\r\nnook of scummy water. And driven into that nook, and wedged as he had\r\ndescribed, was Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s boat; that boat with the stain still in it,\r\nbearing some resemblance to a muffled human form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now tell me I\xe2\x80\x99m a liar!\xe2\x80\x99 said the honest man.\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98With a morbid expectation,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Eugene to Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nsomebody is always going to tell him the truth.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s boat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98I know her well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at the broken scull. Look at the t\xe2\x80\x99other scull gone. NOW tell me I\r\nam a liar!\xe2\x80\x99 said the honest man.\r\n\r\nMr Inspector stepped into the boat. Eugene and Mortimer looked on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And see now!\xe2\x80\x99 added Riderhood, creeping aft, and showing a stretched\r\nrope made fast there and towing overboard. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you he was in\r\nluck again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haul in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Easy to say haul in,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Not so easy done. His luck\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot fouled under the keels of the barges. I tried to haul in last time,\r\nbut I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. See how taut the line is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must have it up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98I am going to take this boat\r\nashore, and his luck along with it. Try easy now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe tried easy now; but the luck resisted; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean to have it, and the boat too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, playing the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nBut still the luck resisted; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll disfigure. Or pull asunder\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not going to do either, not even to your Grandmother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nInspector; \xe2\x80\x98but I mean to have it. Come!\xe2\x80\x99 he added, at once persuasively\r\nand with authority to the hidden object in the water, as he played the\r\nline again; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s no good this sort of game, you know. You MUST come up.\r\nI mean to have you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was so much virtue in this distinctly and decidedly meaning to\r\nhave it, that it yielded a little, even while the line was played.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you so,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Mr Inspector, pulling off his outer coat, and\r\nleaning well over the stern with a will. \xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was an awful sort of fishing, but it no more disconcerted Mr\r\nInspector than if he had been fishing in a punt on a summer evening by\r\nsome soothing weir high up the peaceful river. After certain minutes,\r\nand a few directions to the rest to \xe2\x80\x98ease her a little for\xe2\x80\x99ard,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98now ease her a trifle aft,\xe2\x80\x99 and the like, he said composedly, \xe2\x80\x98All\r\nclear!\xe2\x80\x99 and the line and the boat came free together.\r\n\r\nAccepting Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s proffered hand to help him up, he then put on his\r\ncoat, and said to Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98Hand me over those spare sculls of yours,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull this in to the nearest stairs. Go ahead you, and keep out\r\nin pretty open water, that I mayn\xe2\x80\x99t get fouled again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis directions were obeyed, and they pulled ashore directly; two in one\r\nboat, two in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, again to Riderhood, when they were all on the\r\nslushy stones; \xe2\x80\x98you have had more practice in this than I have had, and\r\nought to be a better workman at it. Undo the tow-rope, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll help\r\nyou haul in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood got into the boat accordingly. It appeared as if he had\r\nscarcely had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s time to touch the rope or look over the stern,\r\nwhen he came scrambling back, as pale as the morning, and gasped out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the Lord, he\xe2\x80\x99s done me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 they all demanded.\r\n\r\nHe pointed behind him at the boat, and gasped to that degree that he\r\ndropped upon the stones to get his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s done me. It\xe2\x80\x99s Gaffer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey ran to the rope, leaving him gasping there. Soon, the form of the\r\nbird of prey, dead some hours, lay stretched upon the shore, with a new\r\nblast storming at it and clotting the wet hair with hail-stones.\r\n\r\nFather, was that you calling me? Father! I thought I heard you call me\r\ntwice before! Words never to be answered, those, upon the earth-side\r\nof the grave. The wind sweeps jeeringly over Father, whips him with the\r\nfrayed ends of his dress and his jagged hair, tries to turn him where he\r\nlies stark on his back, and force his face towards the rising sun, that\r\nhe may be shamed the more. A lull, and the wind is secret and prying\r\nwith him; lifts and lets falls a rag; hides palpitating under another\r\nrag; runs nimbly through his hair and beard. Then, in a rush, it cruelly\r\ntaunts him. Father, was that you calling me? Was it you, the voiceless\r\nand the dead? Was it you, thus buffeted as you lie here in a heap? Was\r\nit you, thus baptized unto Death, with these flying impurities now flung\r\nupon your face? Why not speak, Father? Soaking into this filthy ground\r\nas you lie here, is your own shape. Did you never see such a shape\r\nsoaked into your boat? Speak, Father. Speak to us, the winds, the only\r\nlisteners left you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, after mature deliberation: kneeling on one\r\nknee beside the body, when they had stood looking down on the drowned\r\nman, as he had many a time looked down on many another man: \xe2\x80\x98the way of\r\nit was this. Of course you gentlemen hardly failed to observe that he\r\nwas towing by the neck and arms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had helped to release the rope, and of course not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you will have observed before, and you will observe now, that this\r\nknot, which was drawn chock-tight round his neck by the strain of his\r\nown arms, is a slip-knot\xe2\x80\x99: holding it up for demonstration.\r\n\r\nPlain enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Likewise you will have observed how he had run the other end of this\r\nrope to his boat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt had the curves and indentations in it still, where it had been twined\r\nand bound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98see how it works round upon him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwild tempestuous evening when this man that was,\xe2\x80\x99 stooping to wipe\r\nsome hailstones out of his hair with an end of his own drowned jacket,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--there! Now he\xe2\x80\x99s more like himself; though he\xe2\x80\x99s badly bruised,--when\r\nthis man that was, rows out upon the river on his usual lay. He carries\r\nwith him this coil of rope. He always carries with him this coil of\r\nrope. It\xe2\x80\x99s as well known to me as he was himself. Sometimes it lay in\r\nthe bottom of his boat. Sometimes he hung it loose round his neck.\r\nHe was a light-dresser was this man;--you see?\xe2\x80\x99 lifting the loose\r\nneckerchief over his breast, and taking the opportunity of wiping the\r\ndead lips with it--\xe2\x80\x98and when it was wet, or freezing, or blew cold, he\r\nwould hang this coil of line round his neck. Last evening he does this.\r\nWorse for him! He dodges about in his boat, does this man, till he gets\r\nchilled. His hands,\xe2\x80\x99 taking up one of them, which dropped like a leaden\r\nweight, \xe2\x80\x98get numbed. He sees some object that\xe2\x80\x99s in his way of business,\r\nfloating. He makes ready to secure that object. He unwinds the end of\r\nhis coil that he wants to take some turns on in his boat, and he takes\r\nturns enough on it to secure that it shan\xe2\x80\x99t run out. He makes it too\r\nsecure, as it happens. He is a little longer about this than usual, his\r\nhands being numbed. His object drifts up, before he is quite ready for\r\nit. He catches at it, thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure of the contents of the\r\npockets anyhow, in case he should be parted from it, bends right over\r\nthe stern, and in one of these heavy squalls, or in the cross-swell of\r\ntwo steamers, or in not being quite prepared, or through all or most or\r\nsome, gets a lurch, overbalances and goes head-foremost overboard. Now\r\nsee! He can swim, can this man, and instantly he strikes out. But in\r\nsuch striking-out he tangles his arms, pulls strong on the slip-knot,\r\nand it runs home. The object he had expected to take in tow, floats by,\r\nand his own boat tows him dead, to where we found him, all entangled\r\nin his own line. You\xe2\x80\x99ll ask me how I make out about the pockets? First,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you more; there was silver in \xe2\x80\x98em. How do I make that out?\r\nSimple and satisfactory. Because he\xe2\x80\x99s got it here.\xe2\x80\x99 The lecturer held up\r\nthe tightly clenched right hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is to be done with the remains?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t object to standing by him half a minute, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nthe reply, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll find the nearest of our men to come and take charge of\r\nhim;--I still call it HIM, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, looking back as\r\nhe went, with a philosophical smile upon the force of habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood and was about to add \xe2\x80\x98we may wait at a little\r\ndistance,\xe2\x80\x99 when turning his head he found that no Eugene was there.\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice and called \xe2\x80\x98Eugene! Holloa!\xe2\x80\x99 But no Eugene replied.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight now, and he looked about. But no Eugene was in all\r\nthe view.\r\n\r\nMr Inspector speedily returning down the wooden stairs, with a police\r\nconstable, Lightwood asked him if he had seen his friend leave them? Mr\r\nInspector could not exactly say that he had seen him go, but had noticed\r\nthat he was restless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Singular and entertaining combination, sir, your friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it had not been a part of his singular entertaining combination\r\nto give me the slip under these dreary circumstances at this time of the\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98Can we get anything hot to drink?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe could, and we did. In a public-house kitchen with a large fire. We\r\ngot hot brandy and water, and it revived us wonderfully. Mr Inspector\r\nhaving to Mr Riderhood announced his official intention of \xe2\x80\x98keeping\r\nhis eye upon him\xe2\x80\x99, stood him in a corner of the fireplace, like a wet\r\numbrella, and took no further outward and visible notice of that honest\r\nman, except ordering a separate service of brandy and water for him:\r\napparently out of the public funds.\r\n\r\nAs Mortimer Lightwood sat before the blazing fire, conscious of drinking\r\nbrandy and water then and there in his sleep, and yet at one and the\r\nsame time drinking burnt sherry at the Six Jolly Fellowships, and\r\nlying under the boat on the river shore, and sitting in the boat that\r\nRiderhood rowed, and listening to the lecture recently concluded, and\r\nhaving to dine in the Temple with an unknown man, who described himself\r\nas M. H. F. Eugene Gaffer Harmon, and said he lived at Hailstorm,--as\r\nhe passed through these curious vicissitudes of fatigue and slumber,\r\narranged upon the scale of a dozen hours to the second, he became aware\r\nof answering aloud a communication of pressing importance that had\r\nnever been made to him, and then turned it into a cough on beholding\r\nMr Inspector. For, he felt, with some natural indignation, that that\r\nfunctionary might otherwise suspect him of having closed his eyes, or\r\nwandered in his attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here just before us, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And had hot brandy and water too, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nthen cut off at a great rate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your friend, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, again with dignity.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing, in a mist through which Mr Inspector loomed vague and\r\nlarge, that the officer took upon himself to prepare the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter for what had befallen in the night, and generally that he took\r\neverything upon himself, Mortimer Lightwood stumbled in his sleep to\r\na cab-stand, called a cab, and had entered the army and committed a\r\ncapital military offence and been tried by court martial and found\r\nguilty and had arranged his affairs and been marched out to be shot,\r\nbefore the door banged.\r\n\r\nHard work rowing the cab through the City to the Temple, for a cup of\r\nfrom five to ten thousand pounds value, given by Mr Boffin; and hard\r\nwork holding forth at that immeasurable length to Eugene (when he had\r\nbeen rescued with a rope from the running pavement) for making off in\r\nthat extraordinary manner! But he offered such ample apologies, and was\r\nso very penitent, that when Lightwood got out of the cab, he gave\r\nthe driver a particular charge to be careful of him. Which the driver\r\n(knowing there was no other fare left inside) stared at prodigiously.\r\n\r\nIn short, the night\xe2\x80\x99s work had so exhausted and worn out this actor in\r\nit, that he had become a mere somnambulist. He was too tired to rest in\r\nhis sleep, until he was even tired out of being too tired, and dropped\r\ninto oblivion. Late in the afternoon he awoke, and in some anxiety sent\r\nround to Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s lodging hard by, to inquire if he were up yet?\r\n\r\nOh yes, he was up. In fact, he had not been to bed. He had just come\r\nhome. And here he was, close following on the heels of the message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why what bloodshot, draggled, dishevelled spectacle is this!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nMortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are my feathers so very much rumpled?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, coolly going up to\r\nthe looking-glass. They ARE rather out of sorts. But consider. Such a\r\nnight for plumage!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such a night?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mortimer. \xe2\x80\x98What became of you in the morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, sitting on his bed, \xe2\x80\x98I felt that we\r\nhad bored one another so long, that an unbroken continuance of those\r\nrelations must inevitably terminate in our flying to opposite points of\r\nthe earth. I also felt that I had committed every crime in the Newgate\r\nCalendar. So, for mingled considerations of friendship and felony, I\r\ntook a walk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nTWO NEW SERVANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin sat after breakfast, in the Bower, a prey to\r\nprosperity. Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face denoted Care and Complication. Many\r\ndisordered papers were before him, and he looked at them about as\r\nhopefully as an innocent civilian might look at a crowd of troops whom\r\nhe was required at five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 notice to manoeuvre and review. He had\r\nbeen engaged in some attempts to make notes of these papers; but being\r\ntroubled (as men of his stamp often are) with an exceedingly distrustful\r\nand corrective thumb, that busy member had so often interposed to\r\nsmear his notes, that they were little more legible than the various\r\nimpressions of itself; which blurred his nose and forehead. It is\r\ncurious to consider, in such a case as Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s, what a cheap article\r\nink is, and how far it may be made to go. As a grain of musk will scent\r\na drawer for many years, and still lose nothing appreciable of its\r\noriginal weight, so a halfpenny-worth of ink would blot Mr Boffin to the\r\nroots of his hair and the calves of his legs, without inscribing a line\r\non the paper before him, or appearing to diminish in the inkstand.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin was in such severe literary difficulties that his eyes were\r\nprominent and fixed, and his breathing was stertorous, when, to the\r\ngreat relief of Mrs Boffin, who observed these symptoms with alarm, the\r\nyard bell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that, I wonder!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin drew a long breath, laid down his pen, looked at his notes\r\nas doubting whether he had the pleasure of their acquaintance, and\r\nappeared, on a second perusal of their countenances, to be confirmed\r\nin his impression that he had not, when there was announced by the\r\nhammer-headed young man:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Oh indeed! Our and the Wilfers\xe2\x80\x99 Mutual Friend, my\r\ndear. Yes. Ask him to come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, shaking hands with him. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs Boffin\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re already acquainted with. Well, sir, I am rather unprepared to see\r\nyou, for, to tell you the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so busy with one thing and\r\nanother, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had time to turn your offer over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s apology for both of us: for Mr Boffin, and for me as well,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe smiling Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98But Lor! we can talk it over now; can\xe2\x80\x99t us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith bowed, thanked her, and said he hoped so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see then,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mr Boffin, with his hand to his chin. \xe2\x80\x98It was\r\nSecretary that you named; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said Secretary,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It rather puzzled me at the time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and it rather\r\npuzzled me and Mrs Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards, because (not\r\nto make a mystery of our belief) we have always believed a Secretary to\r\nbe a piece of furniture, mostly of mahogany, lined with green baize or\r\nleather, with a lot of little drawers in it. Now, you won\xe2\x80\x99t think I take\r\na liberty when I mention that you certainly ain\xe2\x80\x99t THAT.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCertainly not, said Mr Rokesmith. But he had used the word in the sense\r\nof Steward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, as to Steward, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, with his hand still\r\nto his chin, \xe2\x80\x98the odds are that Mrs Boffin and me may never go upon the\r\nwater. Being both bad sailors, we should want a Steward if we did; but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s generally one provided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith again explained; defining the duties he sought to\r\nundertake, as those of general superintendent, or manager, or\r\noverlooker, or man of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, for instance--come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, in his pouncing way. \xe2\x80\x98If you\r\nentered my employment, what would you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would keep exact accounts of all the expenditure you sanctioned,\r\nMr Boffin. I would write your letters, under your direction. I would\r\ntransact your business with people in your pay or employment. I would,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwith a glance and a half-smile at the table, \xe2\x80\x98arrange your papers--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin rubbed his inky ear, and looked at his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--And so arrange them as to have them always in order for immediate\r\nreference, with a note of the contents of each outside it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, slowly crumpling his own blotted note\r\nin his hand; \xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to at these present papers, and see what\r\nyou can make of \xe2\x80\x98em, I shall know better what I can make of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done. Relinquishing his hat and gloves, Mr Rokesmith\r\nsat down quietly at the table, arranged the open papers into an orderly\r\nheap, cast his eyes over each in succession, folded it, docketed it on\r\nthe outside, laid it in a second heap, and, when that second heap was\r\ncomplete and the first gone, took from his pocket a piece of string and\r\ntied it together with a remarkably dexterous hand at a running curve and\r\na loop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Very good! Now let us hear what they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nabout; will you be so good?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn Rokesmith read his abstracts aloud. They were all about the new\r\nhouse. Decorator\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, so much. Furniture estimate, so much.\r\nEstimate for furniture of offices, so much. Coach-maker\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, so\r\nmuch. Horse-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, so much. Harness-maker\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, so\r\nmuch. Goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, so much. Total, so very much. Then came\r\ncorrespondence. Acceptance of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s offer of such a date, and to\r\nsuch an effect. Rejection of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s proposal of such a date and to\r\nsuch an effect. Concerning Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of such another date to\r\nsuch another effect. All compact and methodical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Apple-pie order!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, after checking off each inscription\r\nwith his hand, like a man beating time. \xe2\x80\x98And whatever you do with your\r\nink, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think, for you\xe2\x80\x99re as clean as a whistle after it. Now, as\r\nto a letter. Let\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, rubbing his hands in his pleasantly\r\nchildish admiration, \xe2\x80\x98let\xe2\x80\x99s try a letter next.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To whom shall it be addressed, Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anyone. Yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith quickly wrote, and then read aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMr Boffin presents his compliments to Mr John Rokesmith, and begs\r\nto say that he has decided on giving Mr John Rokesmith a trial in the\r\ncapacity he desires to fill. Mr Boffin takes Mr John Rokesmith at his\r\nword, in postponing to some indefinite period, the consideration of\r\nsalary. It is quite understood that Mr Boffin is in no way committed\r\non that point. Mr Boffin has merely to add, that he relies on Mr John\r\nRokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that he will be faithful and serviceable. Mr John\r\nRokesmith will please enter on his duties immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! Now, Noddy!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, clapping her hands, \xe2\x80\x98That IS a\r\ngood one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin was no less delighted; indeed, in his own bosom, he regarded\r\nboth the composition itself and the device that had given birth to it,\r\nas a very remarkable monument of human ingenuity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I tell you, my deary,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t close\r\nwith Mr Rokesmith now at once, and if you ever go a muddling yourself\r\nagain with things never meant nor made for you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an\r\napoplexy--besides iron-moulding your linen--and you\xe2\x80\x99ll break my heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin embraced his spouse for these words of wisdom, and then,\r\ncongratulating John Rokesmith on the brilliancy of his achievements,\r\ngave him his hand in pledge of their new relations. So did Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, who, in his frankness, felt that it did not\r\nbecome him to have a gentleman in his employment five minutes, without\r\nreposing some confidence in him, \xe2\x80\x98you must be let a little more into our\r\naffairs, Rokesmith. I mentioned to you, when I made your acquaintance,\r\nor I might better say when you made mine, that Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s inclinations\r\nwas setting in the way of Fashion, but that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nfashionable we might or might not grow. Well! Mrs Boffin has carried the\r\nday, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going in neck and crop for Fashion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rather inferred that, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied John Rokesmith, \xe2\x80\x98from the scale\r\non which your new establishment is to be maintained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s to be a Spanker. The fact is, my\r\nliterary man named to me that a house with which he is, as I may say,\r\nconnected--in which he has an interest--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As property?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired John Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98not exactly that; a sort of a family tie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Association?\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps. Anyhow, he named to me that the house\r\nhad a board up, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Eminently Aristocratic Mansion to be let or sold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Me and Mrs Boffin went to look at it, and finding it beyond a doubt\r\nEminently Aristocratic (though a trifle high and dull, which after all\r\nmay be part of the same thing) took it. My literary man was so friendly\r\nas to drop into a charming piece of poetry on that occasion, in which he\r\ncomplimented Mrs Boffin on coming into possession of--how did it go, my\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin replied:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe gay, the gay and festive scene,\r\n     The halls, the halls of dazzling light.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it! And it was made neater by there really being two halls\r\nin the house, a front \xe2\x80\x98un and a back \xe2\x80\x98un, besides the servants\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nHe likewise dropped into a very pretty piece of poetry to be sure,\r\nrespecting the extent to which he would be willing to put himself out\r\nof the way to bring Mrs Boffin round, in case she should ever get low\r\nin her spirits in the house. Mrs Boffin has a wonderful memory. Will you\r\nrepeat it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin complied, by reciting the verses in which this obliging offer\r\nhad been made, exactly as she had received them.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee how the maiden wept, Mrs Boffin,\r\n     When her true love was slain ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\n     And how her broken spirit slept, Mrs Boffin,\r\n     And never woke again ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee (if agreeable to Mr Boffin) how the steed drew\r\n     nigh,\r\n     And left his lord afar;\r\n     And if my tale (which I hope Mr Boffin might excuse) should\r\n     make you sigh,\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99ll strike the light guitar.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Correct to the letter!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98And I consider that the poetry\r\nbrings us both in, in a beautiful manner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe effect of the poem on the Secretary being evidently to astonish\r\nhim, Mr Boffin was confirmed in his high opinion of it, and was greatly\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you see, Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98a literary man--WITH a wooden\r\nleg--is liable to jealousy. I shall therefore cast about for comfortable\r\nways and means of not calling up Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy, but of keeping you in\r\nyour department, and keeping him in his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98What I say is, the world\xe2\x80\x99s wide enough for all\r\nof us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98when not literary. But when so,\r\nnot so. And I am bound to bear in mind that I took Wegg on, at a time\r\nwhen I had no thought of being fashionable or of leaving the Bower. To\r\nlet him feel himself anyways slighted now, would be to be guilty of\r\na meanness, and to act like having one\xe2\x80\x99s head turned by the halls of\r\ndazzling light. Which Lord forbid! Rokesmith, what shall we say about\r\nyour living in the house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In this house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no. I have got other plans for this house. In the new house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That will be as you please, Mr Boffin. I hold myself quite at your\r\ndisposal. You know where I live at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, after considering the point; \xe2\x80\x98suppose you keep\r\nas you are for the present, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll decide by-and-by. You\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to\r\ntake charge at once, of all that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the new house, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most willingly. I will begin this very day. Will you give me the\r\naddress?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin repeated it, and the Secretary wrote it down in his\r\npocket-book. Mrs Boffin took the opportunity of his being so engaged,\r\nto get a better observation of his face than she had yet taken. It\r\nimpressed her in his favour, for she nodded aside to Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I like\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will see directly that everything is in train, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee. Being here, would you care at all to look round the Bower?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should greatly like it. I have heard so much of its story.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. And he and Mrs Boffin led the way.\r\n\r\nA gloomy house the Bower, with sordid signs on it of having been,\r\nthrough its long existence as Harmony Jail, in miserly holding. Bare of\r\npaint, bare of paper on the walls, bare of furniture, bare of experience\r\nof human life. Whatever is built by man for man\xe2\x80\x99s occupation, must,\r\nlike natural creations, fulfil the intention of its existence, or soon\r\nperish. This old house had wasted--more from desuetude than it would\r\nhave wasted from use, twenty years for one.\r\n\r\nA certain leanness falls upon houses not sufficiently imbued with life\r\n(as if they were nourished upon it), which was very noticeable here.\r\nThe staircase, balustrades, and rails, had a spare look--an air of being\r\ndenuded to the bone--which the panels of the walls and the jambs of the\r\ndoors and windows also bore. The scanty moveables partook of it; save\r\nfor the cleanliness of the place, the dust--into which they were all\r\nresolving would have lain thick on the floors; and those, both in colour\r\nand in grain, were worn like old faces that had kept much alone.\r\n\r\nThe bedroom where the clutching old man had lost his grip on life, was\r\nleft as he had left it. There was the old grisly four-post bedstead,\r\nwithout hangings, and with a jail-like upper rim of iron and spikes; and\r\nthere was the old patch-work counterpane. There was the tight-clenched\r\nold bureau, receding atop like a bad and secret forehead; there was the\r\ncumbersome old table with twisted legs, at the bed-side; and there\r\nwas the box upon it, in which the will had lain. A few old chairs with\r\npatch-work covers, under which the more precious stuff to be preserved\r\nhad slowly lost its quality of colour without imparting pleasure to any\r\neye, stood against the wall. A hard family likeness was on all these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The room was kept like this, Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98against the\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s return. In short, everything in the house was kept exactly as it\r\ncame to us, for him to see and approve. Even now, nothing is changed\r\nbut our own room below-stairs that you have just left. When the son came\r\nhome for the last time in his life, and for the last time in his life\r\nsaw his father, it was most likely in this room that they met.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the Secretary looked all round it, his eyes rested on a side door in\r\na corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another staircase,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, unlocking the door, \xe2\x80\x98leading down\r\ninto the yard. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go down this way, as you may like to see the yard,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s all in the road. When the son was a little child, it was up\r\nand down these stairs that he mostly came and went to his father. He was\r\nvery timid of his father. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him sit on these stairs, in his\r\nshy way, poor child, many a time. Mr and Mrs Boffin have comforted him,\r\nsitting with his little book on these stairs, often.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! And his poor sister too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98And here\xe2\x80\x99s the sunny\r\nplace on the white wall where they one day measured one another. Their\r\nown little hands wrote up their names here, only with a pencil; but the\r\nnames are here still, and the poor dears gone for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must take care of the names, old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98We must\r\ntake care of the names. They shan\xe2\x80\x99t be rubbed out in our time, nor yet,\r\nif we can help it, in the time after us. Poor little children!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor little children!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\nThey had opened the door at the bottom of the staircase giving on the\r\nyard, and they stood in the sunlight, looking at the scrawl of the two\r\nunsteady childish hands two or three steps up the staircase. There was\r\nsomething in this simple memento of a blighted childhood, and in the\r\ntenderness of Mrs Boffin, that touched the Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin then showed his new man of business the Mounds, and his own\r\nparticular Mound which had been left him as his legacy under the will\r\nbefore he acquired the whole estate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would have been enough for us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98in case it had\r\npleased God to spare the last of those two young lives and sorrowful\r\ndeaths. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the treasures of the yard, and at the outside of the house, and at\r\nthe detached building which Mr Boffin pointed out as the residence\r\nof himself and his wife during the many years of their service, the\r\nSecretary looked with interest. It was not until Mr Boffin had shown\r\nhim every wonder of the Bower twice over, that he remembered his having\r\nduties to discharge elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have no instructions to give me, Mr Boffin, in reference to this\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not any, Rokesmith. No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might I ask, without seeming impertinent, whether you have any\r\nintention of selling it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not. In remembrance of our old master, our old master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren, and our old service, me and Mrs Boffin mean to keep it up as\r\nit stands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes glanced with so much meaning in them at the Mounds,\r\nthat Mr Boffin said, as if in answer to a remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing. I may sell THEM, though I should be sorry\r\nto see the neighbourhood deprived of \xe2\x80\x98em too. It\xe2\x80\x99ll look but a poor dead\r\nflat without the Mounds. Still I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nalways there, for the sake of the beauty of the landscape. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nhurry about it; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I say at present. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a scholar in much,\r\nRokesmith, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty fair scholar in dust. I can price the Mounds\r\nto a fraction, and I know how they can be best disposed of; and likewise\r\nthat they take no harm by standing where they do. You\xe2\x80\x99ll look in\r\nto-morrow, will you be so kind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every day. And the sooner I can get you into your new house, complete,\r\nthe better you will be pleased, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t that I\xe2\x80\x99m in a mortal hurry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98only when\r\nyou DO pay people for looking alive, it\xe2\x80\x99s as well to know that they ARE\r\nlooking alive. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t that your opinion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the Secretary; and so withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin to himself; subsiding into his regular series of\r\nturns in the yard, \xe2\x80\x98if I can make it comfortable with Wegg, my affairs\r\nwill be going smooth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man of low cunning had, of course, acquired a mastery over the man\r\nof high simplicity. The mean man had, of course, got the better of the\r\ngenerous man. How long such conquests last, is another matter; that they\r\nare achieved, is every-day experience, not even to be flourished away by\r\nPodsnappery itself. The undesigning Boffin had become so far immeshed\r\nby the wily Wegg that his mind misgave him he was a very designing man\r\nindeed in purposing to do more for Wegg. It seemed to him (so skilful\r\nwas Wegg) that he was plotting darkly, when he was contriving to do the\r\nvery thing that Wegg was plotting to get him to do. And thus, while he\r\nwas mentally turning the kindest of kind faces on Wegg this morning, he\r\nwas not absolutely sure but that he might somehow deserve the charge of\r\nturning his back on him.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Mr Boffin passed but anxious hours until evening came,\r\nand with it Mr Wegg, stumping leisurely to the Roman Empire. At about\r\nthis period Mr Boffin had become profoundly interested in the fortunes\r\nof a great military leader known to him as Bully Sawyers, but perhaps\r\nbetter known to fame and easier of identification by the classical\r\nstudent, under the less Britannic name of Belisarius. Even this\r\ngeneral\xe2\x80\x99s career paled in interest for Mr Boffin before the clearing of\r\nhis conscience with Wegg; and hence, when that literary gentleman had\r\naccording to custom eaten and drunk until he was all a-glow, and when\r\nhe took up his book with the usual chirping introduction, \xe2\x80\x98And now, Mr\r\nBoffin, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ll decline and we\xe2\x80\x99ll fall!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember, Wegg, when I first told you that I wanted to make a sort\r\nof offer to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me get on my considering cap, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman, turning\r\nthe open book face downward. \xe2\x80\x98When you first told me that you wanted\r\nto make a sort of offer to me? Now let me think.\xe2\x80\x99 (as if there were the\r\nleast necessity) \xe2\x80\x98Yes, to be sure I do, Mr Boffin. It was at my corner.\r\nTo be sure it was! You had first asked me whether I liked your name,\r\nand Candour had compelled a reply in the negative case. I little thought\r\nthen, sir, how familiar that name would come to be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it will be more familiar still, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you, Mr Boffin? Much obliged to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. Is it your pleasure,\r\nsir, that we decline and we fall?\xe2\x80\x99 with a feint of taking up the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not just yet awhile, Wegg. In fact, I have got another offer to make\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg (who had had nothing else in his mind for several nights) took\r\noff his spectacles with an air of bland surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll like it, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that reticent individual. \xe2\x80\x98I hope it may\r\nprove so. On all accounts, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x99 (This, as a philanthropic\r\naspiration.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98of not keeping a stall, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98that I should like to be shown the\r\ngentleman prepared to make it worth my while!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg was going to say, My Benefactor, and had said My Bene, when a\r\ngrandiloquent change came over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Mr Boffin, not you sir. Anybody but you. Do not fear, Mr Boffin,\r\nthat I shall contaminate the premises which your gold has bought, with\r\nMY lowly pursuits. I am aware, sir, that it would not become me to carry\r\non my little traffic under the windows of your mansion. I have already\r\nthought of that, and taken my measures. No need to be bought out, sir.\r\nWould Stepney Fields be considered intrusive? If not remote enough, I\r\ncan go remoter. In the words of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s song, which I do not quite\r\nremember:\r\n\r\n     Thrown on the wide world, doom\xe2\x80\x99d to wander and roam,\r\n     Bereft of my parents, bereft of a home,\r\n     A stranger to something and what\xe2\x80\x99s his name joy,\r\n     Behold little Edmund the poor Peasant boy.\r\n\r\n--And equally,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, repairing the want of direct application\r\nin the last line, \xe2\x80\x98behold myself on a similar footing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Wegg, Wegg, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated the excellent Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98You are too\r\nsensitive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know I am, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, with obstinate magnanimity. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nacquainted with my faults. I always was, from a child, too sensitive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But listen,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the Golden Dustman; \xe2\x80\x98hear me out, Wegg. You have\r\ntaken it into your head that I mean to pension you off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, still with an obstinate magnanimity. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nacquainted with my faults. Far be it from me to deny them. I HAVE taken\r\nit into my head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I DON\xe2\x80\x99T mean it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe assurance seemed hardly as comforting to Mr Wegg, as Mr Boffin\r\nintended it to be. Indeed, an appreciable elongation of his visage might\r\nhave been observed as he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, indeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98because that would express, as I understand\r\nit, that you were not going to do anything to deserve your money. But\r\nyou are; you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Wegg, cheering up bravely, \xe2\x80\x98is quite another\r\npair of shoes. Now, my independence as a man is again elevated. Now, I\r\nno longer\r\n\r\n     Weep for the hour,\r\n     When to Boffinses bower,\r\n     The Lord of the valley with offers came;\r\n     Neither does the moon hide her light\r\n     From the heavens to-night,\r\n     And weep behind her clouds o\xe2\x80\x99er any individual in the present\r\n     Company\xe2\x80\x99s shame.\r\n\r\n--Please to proceed, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Wegg, both for your confidence in me and for your frequent\r\ndropping into poetry; both of which is friendly. Well, then; my idea is,\r\nthat you should give up your stall, and that I should put you into the\r\nBower here, to keep it for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasant spot; and a man with\r\ncoals and candles and a pound a week might be in clover here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem! Would that man, sir--we will say that man, for the purposes of\r\nargueyment;\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg made a smiling demonstration of great perspicuity\r\nhere; \xe2\x80\x98would that man, sir, be expected to throw any other capacity in,\r\nor would any other capacity be considered extra? Now let us (for the\r\npurposes of argueyment) suppose that man to be engaged as a reader: say\r\n(for the purposes of argueyment) in the evening. Would that man\xe2\x80\x99s pay as\r\na reader in the evening, be added to the other amount, which, adopting\r\nyour language, we will call clover; or would it merge into that amount,\r\nor clover?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it would be added.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose it would, sir. You are right, sir. Exactly my own views,\r\nMr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Wegg rose, and balancing himself on his wooden leg,\r\nfluttered over his prey with extended hand. \xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, consider it\r\ndone. Say no more, sir, not a word more. My stall and I are for ever\r\nparted. The collection of ballads will in future be reserved for private\r\nstudy, with the object of making poetry tributary\xe2\x80\x99--Wegg was so proud\r\nof having found this word, that he said it again, with a capital\r\nletter--\xe2\x80\x98Tributary, to friendship. Mr Boffin, don\xe2\x80\x99t allow yourself to\r\nbe made uncomfortable by the pang it gives me to part from my stock and\r\nstall. Similar emotion was undergone by my own father when promoted\r\nfor his merits from his occupation as a waterman to a situation under\r\nGovernment. His Christian name was Thomas. His words at the time (I was\r\nthen an infant, but so deep was their impression on me, that I committed\r\nthem to memory) were:\r\n\r\n     Then farewell my trim-built wherry,\r\n     Oars and coat and badge farewell!\r\n     Never more at Chelsea Ferry,\r\n     Shall your Thomas take a spell!\r\n\r\n--My father got over it, Mr Boffin, and so shall I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile delivering these valedictory observations, Wegg continually\r\ndisappointed Mr Boffin of his hand by flourishing it in the air. He now\r\ndarted it at his patron, who took it, and felt his mind relieved of a\r\ngreat weight: observing that as they had arranged their joint affairs\r\nso satisfactorily, he would now be glad to look into those of Bully\r\nSawyers. Which, indeed, had been left over-night in a very unpromising\r\nposture, and for whose impending expedition against the Persians the\r\nweather had been by no means favourable all day.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg resumed his spectacles therefore. But Sawyers was not to be of\r\nthe party that night; for, before Wegg had found his place, Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntread was heard upon the stairs, so unusually heavy and hurried, that Mr\r\nBoffin would have started up at the sound, anticipating some occurrence\r\nmuch out of the common course, even though she had not also called to\r\nhim in an agitated tone.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin hurried out, and found her on the dark staircase, panting,\r\nwith a lighted candle in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come up-stairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMuch surprised, Mr Boffin went up stairs and accompanied Mrs Boffin into\r\ntheir own room: a second large room on the same floor as the room in\r\nwhich the late proprietor had died. Mr Boffin looked all round him,\r\nand saw nothing more unusual than various articles of folded linen on a\r\nlarge chest, which Mrs Boffin had been sorting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it, my dear? Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re frightened! YOU frightened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not one of that sort certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, as she sat down\r\nin a chair to recover herself, and took her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arm; \xe2\x80\x98but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvery strange!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noddy, the faces of the old man and the two children are all over the\r\nhouse to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr Boffin. But not without a certain uncomfortable\r\nsensation gliding down his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it must sound foolish, and yet it is so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did you think you saw them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I think I saw them anywhere. I felt them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Touched them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Felt them in the air. I was sorting those things on the chest, and\r\nnot thinking of the old man or the children, but singing to myself, when\r\nall in a moment I felt there was a face growing out of the dark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What face?\xe2\x80\x99 asked her husband, looking about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For a moment it was the old man\xe2\x80\x99s, and then it got younger. For a\r\nmoment it was both the children\xe2\x80\x99s, and then it got older. For a moment\r\nit was a strange face, and then it was all the faces.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then it was gone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and then it was gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where were you then, old lady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, at the chest. Well; I got the better of it, and went on sorting,\r\nand went on singing to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cLor!\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think of something\r\nelse--something comfortable--and put it out of my head.\xe2\x80\x9d So I thought\r\nof the new house and Miss Bella Wilfer, and was thinking at a great rate\r\nwith that sheet there in my hand, when all of a sudden, the faces seemed\r\nto be hidden in among the folds of it and I let it drop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs it still lay on the floor where it had fallen, Mr Boffin picked it up\r\nand laid it on the chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then you ran down stairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d try another room, and shake it off. I says to myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and walk slowly up and down the old man\xe2\x80\x99s room three times,\r\nfrom end to end, and then I shall have conquered it.\xe2\x80\x9d I went in with the\r\ncandle in my hand; but the moment I came near the bed, the air got thick\r\nwith them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With the faces?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and I even felt that they were in the dark behind the side-door,\r\nand on the little staircase, floating away into the yard. Then, I called\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, lost in amazement, looked at Mrs Boffin. Mrs Boffin, lost in\r\nher own fluttered inability to make this out, looked at Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Golden Dustman, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll at once get rid of\r\nWegg for the night, because he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to inhabit the Bower, and it\r\nmight be put into his head or somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s, if he heard this and it\r\ngot about that the house is haunted. Whereas we know better. Don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never had the feeling in the house before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98and I\r\nhave been about it alone at all hours of the night. I have been in the\r\nhouse when Death was in it, and I have been in the house when Murder was\r\na new part of its adventures, and I never had a fright in it yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And won\xe2\x80\x99t again, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Depend upon it, it comes of\r\nthinking and dwelling on that dark spot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but why didn\xe2\x80\x99t it come before?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\nThis draft on Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy could only be met by that gentleman\r\nwith the remark that everything that is at all, must begin at some time.\r\nThen, tucking his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arm under his own, that she might not be left\r\nby herself to be troubled again, he descended to release Wegg. Who,\r\nbeing something drowsy after his plentiful repast, and constitutionally\r\nof a shirking temperament, was well enough pleased to stump away,\r\nwithout doing what he had come to do, and was paid for doing.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin then put on his hat, and Mrs Boffin her shawl; and the pair,\r\nfurther provided with a bunch of keys and a lighted lantern, went\r\nall over the dismal house--dismal everywhere, but in their own two\r\nrooms--from cellar to cock-loft. Not resting satisfied with giving that\r\nmuch chace to Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s fancies, they pursued them into the yard and\r\noutbuildings, and under the Mounds. And setting the lantern, when all\r\nwas done, at the foot of one of the Mounds, they comfortably trotted to\r\nand fro for an evening walk, to the end that the murky cobwebs in Mrs\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s brain might be blown away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin when they came in to supper. \xe2\x80\x98That was\r\nthe treatment, you see. Completely worked round, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, deary,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, laying aside her shawl. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not nervous\r\nany more. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit troubled now. I\xe2\x80\x99d go anywhere about the house\r\nthe same as ever. But--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99ve only to shut my eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, speaking with her eyes closed, and her\r\nleft hand thoughtfully touching her brow, \xe2\x80\x98then, there they are! The old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s face, and it gets younger. The two children\xe2\x80\x99s faces, and they get\r\nolder. A face that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And then all the faces!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOpening her eyes again, and seeing her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face across the table,\r\nshe leaned forward to give it a pat on the cheek, and sat down to\r\nsupper, declaring it to be the best face in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nMINDERS AND RE-MINDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary lost no time in getting to work, and his vigilance\r\nand method soon set their mark on the Golden Dustman\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. His\r\nearnestness in determining to understand the length and breadth and\r\ndepth of every piece of work submitted to him by his employer, was as\r\nspecial as his despatch in transacting it. He accepted no information\r\nor explanation at second hand, but made himself the master of everything\r\nconfided to him.\r\n\r\nOne part of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, underlying all the rest, might have\r\nbeen mistrusted by a man with a better knowledge of men than the\r\nGolden Dustman had. The Secretary was as far from being inquisitive\r\nor intrusive as Secretary could be, but nothing less than a complete\r\nunderstanding of the whole of the affairs would content him. It soon\r\nbecame apparent (from the knowledge with which he set out) that he must\r\nhave been to the office where the Harmon will was registered, and must\r\nhave read the will. He anticipated Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s consideration whether he\r\nshould be advised with on this or that topic, by showing that he\r\nalready knew of it and understood it. He did this with no attempt at\r\nconcealment, seeming to be satisfied that it was part of his duty to\r\nhave prepared himself at all attainable points for its utmost discharge.\r\n\r\nThis might--let it be repeated--have awakened some little vague mistrust\r\nin a man more worldly-wise than the Golden Dustman. On the other hand,\r\nthe Secretary was discerning, discreet, and silent, though as zealous as\r\nif the affairs had been his own. He showed no love of patronage or the\r\ncommand of money, but distinctly preferred resigning both to Mr\r\nBoffin. If, in his limited sphere, he sought power, it was the power\r\nof knowledge; the power derivable from a perfect comprehension of his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAs on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s face there was a nameless cloud, so on his\r\nmanner there was a shadow equally indefinable. It was not that he was\r\nembarrassed, as on that first night with the Wilfer family; he was\r\nhabitually unembarrassed now, and yet the something remained. It was not\r\nthat his manner was bad, as on that occasion; it was now very good, as\r\nbeing modest, gracious, and ready. Yet the something never left it. It\r\nhas been written of men who have undergone a cruel captivity, or who\r\nhave passed through a terrible strait, or who in self-preservation have\r\nkilled a defenceless fellow-creature, that the record thereof has never\r\nfaded from their countenances until they died. Was there any such record\r\nhere?\r\n\r\nHe established a temporary office for himself in the new house, and all\r\nwent well under his hand, with one singular exception. He manifestly\r\nobjected to communicate with Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor. Two or three times,\r\nwhen there was some slight occasion for his doing so, he transferred\r\nthe task to Mr Boffin; and his evasion of it soon became so curiously\r\napparent, that Mr Boffin spoke to him on the subject of his reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so,\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary admitted. \xe2\x80\x98I would rather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHad he any personal objection to Mr Lightwood?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHad he suffered from law-suits?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not more than other men,\xe2\x80\x99 was his short answer.\r\n\r\nWas he prejudiced against the race of lawyers?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. But while I am in your employment, sir, I would rather be excused\r\nfrom going between the lawyer and the client. Of course if you press it,\r\nMr Boffin, I am ready to comply. But I should take it as a great favour\r\nif you would not press it without urgent occasion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, it could not be said that there WAS urgent occasion, for Lightwood\r\nretained no other affairs in his hands than such as still lingered and\r\nlanguished about the undiscovered criminal, and such as arose out of the\r\npurchase of the house. Many other matters that might have travelled to\r\nhim, now stopped short at the Secretary, under whose administration they\r\nwere far more expeditiously and satisfactorily disposed of than they\r\nwould have been if they had got into Young Blight\xe2\x80\x99s domain. This the\r\nGolden Dustman quite understood. Even the matter immediately in hand\r\nwas of very little moment as requiring personal appearance on the\r\nSecretary\xe2\x80\x99s part, for it amounted to no more than this:--The death of\r\nHexam rendering the sweat of the honest man\xe2\x80\x99s brow unprofitable, the\r\nhonest man had shufflingly declined to moisten his brow for nothing,\r\nwith that severe exertion which is known in legal circles as swearing\r\nyour way through a stone wall. Consequently, that new light had gone\r\nsputtering out. But, the airing of the old facts had led some one\r\nconcerned to suggest that it would be well before they were reconsigned\r\nto their gloomy shelf--now probably for ever--to induce or compel that\r\nMr Julius Handford to reappear and be questioned. And all traces of Mr\r\nJulius Handford being lost, Lightwood now referred to his client for\r\nauthority to seek him through public advertisement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does your objection go to writing to Lightwood, Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the least, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll write him a line, and say he is free to do what he\r\nlikes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it promises.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it promises,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still, he may do what he likes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will write immediately. Let me thank you for so considerately\r\nyielding to my disinclination. It may seem less unreasonable, if I avow\r\nto you that although I don\xe2\x80\x99t know Mr Lightwood, I have a disagreeable\r\nassociation connected with him. It is not his fault; he is not at all to\r\nblame for it, and does not even know my name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin dismissed the matter with a nod or two. The letter was\r\nwritten, and next day Mr Julius Handford was advertised for. He was\r\nrequested to place himself in communication with Mr Mortimer Lightwood,\r\nas a possible means of furthering the ends of justice, and a reward was\r\noffered to any one acquainted with his whereabout who would communicate\r\nthe same to the said Mr Mortimer Lightwood at his office in the Temple.\r\nEvery day for six weeks this advertisement appeared at the head of all\r\nthe newspapers, and every day for six weeks the Secretary, when he\r\nsaw it, said to himself; in the tone in which he had said to his\r\nemployer,--\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it promises!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmong his first occupations the pursuit of that orphan wanted by\r\nMrs Boffin held a conspicuous place. From the earliest moment of his\r\nengagement he showed a particular desire to please her, and, knowing her\r\nto have this object at heart, he followed it up with unwearying alacrity\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Milvey had found their search a difficult one. Either an\r\neligible orphan was of the wrong sex (which almost always happened)\r\nor was too old, or too young, or too sickly, or too dirty, or too much\r\naccustomed to the streets, or too likely to run away; or, it was found\r\nimpossible to complete the philanthropic transaction without buying the\r\norphan. For, the instant it became known that anybody wanted the orphan,\r\nup started some affectionate relative of the orphan who put a price upon\r\nthe orphan\xe2\x80\x99s head. The suddenness of an orphan\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the market was\r\nnot to be paralleled by the maddest records of the Stock Exchange. He\r\nwould be at five thousand per cent discount out at nurse making a mud\r\npie at nine in the morning, and (being inquired for) would go up to\r\nfive thousand per cent premium before noon. The market was \xe2\x80\x98rigged\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nvarious artful ways. Counterfeit stock got into circulation. Parents\r\nboldly represented themselves as dead, and brought their orphans with\r\nthem. Genuine orphan-stock was surreptitiously withdrawn from the\r\nmarket. It being announced, by emissaries posted for the purpose, that\r\nMr and Mrs Milvey were coming down the court, orphan scrip would be\r\ninstantly concealed, and production refused, save on a condition usually\r\nstated by the brokers as \xe2\x80\x98a gallon of beer\xe2\x80\x99. Likewise, fluctuations of\r\na wild and South-Sea nature were occasioned, by orphan-holders keeping\r\nback, and then rushing into the market a dozen together. But, the\r\nuniform principle at the root of all these various operations was\r\nbargain and sale; and that principle could not be recognized by Mr and\r\nMrs Milvey.\r\n\r\nAt length, tidings were received by the Reverend Frank of a charming\r\norphan to be found at Brentford. One of the deceased parents (late his\r\nparishioners) had a poor widowed grandmother in that agreeable town, and\r\nshe, Mrs Betty Higden, had carried off the orphan with maternal care,\r\nbut could not afford to keep him.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary proposed to Mrs Boffin, either to go down himself and\r\ntake a preliminary survey of this orphan, or to drive her down, that\r\nshe might at once form her own opinion. Mrs Boffin preferring the latter\r\ncourse, they set off one morning in a hired phaeton, conveying the\r\nhammer-headed young man behind them.\r\n\r\nThe abode of Mrs Betty Higden was not easy to find, lying in such\r\ncomplicated back settlements of muddy Brentford that they left their\r\nequipage at the sign of the Three Magpies, and went in search of it on\r\nfoot. After many inquiries and defeats, there was pointed out to them\r\nin a lane, a very small cottage residence, with a board across the open\r\ndoorway, hooked on to which board by the armpits was a young gentleman\r\nof tender years, angling for mud with a headless wooden horse and line.\r\nIn this young sportsman, distinguished by a crisply curling auburn head\r\nand a bluff countenance, the Secretary descried the orphan.\r\n\r\nIt unfortunately happened as they quickened their pace, that the orphan,\r\nlost to considerations of personal safety in the ardour of the moment,\r\noverbalanced himself and toppled into the street. Being an orphan of a\r\nchubby conformation, he then took to rolling, and had rolled into the\r\ngutter before they could come up. From the gutter he was rescued by John\r\nRokesmith, and thus the first meeting with Mrs Higden was inaugurated by\r\nthe awkward circumstance of their being in possession--one would say at\r\nfirst sight unlawful possession--of the orphan, upside down and purple\r\nin the countenance. The board across the doorway too, acting as a trap\r\nequally for the feet of Mrs Higden coming out, and the feet of Mrs\r\nBoffin and John Rokesmith going in, greatly increased the difficulty of\r\nthe situation: to which the cries of the orphan imparted a lugubrious\r\nand inhuman character.\r\n\r\nAt first, it was impossible to explain, on account of the orphan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98holding his breath\xe2\x80\x99: a most terrific proceeding, super-inducing in the\r\norphan lead-colour rigidity and a deadly silence, compared with which\r\nhis cries were music yielding the height of enjoyment. But as he\r\ngradually recovered, Mrs Boffin gradually introduced herself; and\r\nsmiling peace was gradually wooed back to Mrs Betty Higden\xe2\x80\x99s home.\r\n\r\nIt was then perceived to be a small home with a large mangle in it, at\r\nthe handle of which machine stood a very long boy, with a very little\r\nhead, and an open mouth of disproportionate capacity that seemed to\r\nassist his eyes in staring at the visitors. In a corner below the\r\nmangle, on a couple of stools, sat two very little children: a boy and a\r\ngirl; and when the very long boy, in an interval of staring, took a turn\r\nat the mangle, it was alarming to see how it lunged itself at those two\r\ninnocents, like a catapult designed for their destruction, harmlessly\r\nretiring when within an inch of their heads. The room was clean and\r\nneat. It had a brick floor, and a window of diamond panes, and a flounce\r\nhanging below the chimney-piece, and strings nailed from bottom to top\r\noutside the window on which scarlet-beans were to grow in the coming\r\nseason if the Fates were propitious. However propitious they might have\r\nbeen in the seasons that were gone, to Betty Higden in the matter of\r\nbeans, they had not been very favourable in the matter of coins; for it\r\nwas easy to see that she was poor.\r\n\r\nShe was one of those old women, was Mrs Betty Higden, who by dint of\r\nan indomitable purpose and a strong constitution fight out many years,\r\nthough each year has come with its new knock-down blows fresh to the\r\nfight against her, wearied by it; an active old woman, with a bright\r\ndark eye and a resolute face, yet quite a tender creature too; not a\r\nlogically-reasoning woman, but God is good, and hearts may count in\r\nHeaven as high as heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes sure!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, when the business was opened, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs Milvey had the\r\nkindness to write to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and I got Sloppy to read it. It was a\r\npretty letter. But she\xe2\x80\x99s an affable lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe visitors glanced at the long boy, who seemed to indicate by a\r\nbroader stare of his mouth and eyes that in him Sloppy stood confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For I aint, you must know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, \xe2\x80\x98much of a hand at reading\r\nwriting-hand, though I can read my Bible and most print. And I do love a\r\nnewspaper. You mightn\xe2\x80\x99t think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a\r\nnewspaper. He do the Police in different voices.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe visitors again considered it a point of politeness to look at\r\nSloppy, who, looking at them, suddenly threw back his head, extended his\r\nmouth to its utmost width, and laughed loud and long. At this the two\r\ninnocents, with their brains in that apparent danger, laughed, and Mrs\r\nHigden laughed, and the orphan laughed, and then the visitors laughed.\r\nWhich was more cheerful than intelligible.\r\n\r\nThen Sloppy seeming to be seized with an industrious mania or fury,\r\nturned to at the mangle, and impelled it at the heads of the innocents\r\nwith such a creaking and rumbling, that Mrs Higden stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentlefolks can\xe2\x80\x99t hear themselves speak, Sloppy. Bide a bit, bide a\r\nbit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the dear child in your lap?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, this is Johnny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Johnny, too!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, turning to the Secretary; \xe2\x80\x98already\r\nJohnny! Only one of the two names left to give him! He\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith his chin tucked down in his shy childish manner, he was looking\r\nfurtively at Mrs Boffin out of his blue eyes, and reaching his fat\r\ndimpled hand up to the lips of the old woman, who was kissing it by\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, he\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s a dear darling boy, he\xe2\x80\x99s the child\r\nof my own last left daughter\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. But she\xe2\x80\x99s gone the way of all\r\nthe rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those are not his brother and sister?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, dear no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Those are Minders.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Minders?\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Left to be Minded, sir. I keep a Minding-School. I can take only three,\r\non account of the Mangle. But I love children, and Four-pence a week is\r\nFour-pence. Come here, Toddles and Poddles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nToddles was the pet-name of the boy; Poddles of the girl. At their\r\nlittle unsteady pace, they came across the floor, hand-in-hand, as if\r\nthey were traversing an extremely difficult road intersected by brooks,\r\nand, when they had had their heads patted by Mrs Betty Higden, made\r\nlunges at the orphan, dramatically representing an attempt to bear him,\r\ncrowing, into captivity and slavery. All the three children enjoyed this\r\nto a delightful extent, and the sympathetic Sloppy again laughed long\r\nand loud. When it was discreet to stop the play, Betty Higden said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go to your seats Toddles and Poddles,\xe2\x80\x99 and they returned hand-in-hand\r\nacross country, seeming to find the brooks rather swollen by late rains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Master--or Mister--Sloppy?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, in doubt whether he\r\nwas man, boy, or what.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A love-child,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Betty Higden, dropping her voice; \xe2\x80\x98parents\r\nnever known; found in the street. He was brought up in the--\xe2\x80\x99 with a\r\nshiver of repugnance, \xe2\x80\x98--the House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Poor-house?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\nMrs Higden set that resolute old face of hers, and darkly nodded yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You dislike the mention of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dislike the mention of it?\xe2\x80\x99 answered the old woman. \xe2\x80\x98Kill me sooner\r\nthan take me there. Throw this pretty child under cart-horses feet and\r\na loaded waggon, sooner than take him there. Come to us and find us all\r\na-dying, and set a light to us all where we lie and let us all blaze\r\naway with the house into a heap of cinders sooner than move a corpse of\r\nus there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA surprising spirit in this lonely woman after so many years of hard\r\nworking, and hard living, my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable\r\nBoards! What is it that we call it in our grandiose speeches? British\r\nindependence, rather perverted? Is that, or something like it, the ring\r\nof the cant?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I never read in the newspapers,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dame, fondling the\r\nchild--\xe2\x80\x98God help me and the like of me!--how the worn-out people that\r\ndo come down to that, get driven from post to pillar and pillar to post,\r\na-purpose to tire them out! Do I never read how they are put off, put\r\noff, put off--how they are grudged, grudged, grudged, the shelter, or\r\nthe doctor, or the drop of physic, or the bit of bread? Do I never\r\nread how they grow heartsick of it and give it up, after having let\r\nthemselves drop so low, and how they after all die out for want of help?\r\nThen I say, I hope I can die as well as another, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll die without\r\nthat disgrace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAbsolutely impossible my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards, by\r\nany stretch of legislative wisdom to set these perverse people right in\r\ntheir logic?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Johnny, my pretty,\xe2\x80\x99 continued old Betty, caressing the child, and\r\nrather mourning over it than speaking to it, \xe2\x80\x98your old Granny Betty is\r\nnigher fourscore year than threescore and ten. She never begged nor had\r\na penny of the Union money in all her life. She paid scot and she\r\npaid lot when she had money to pay; she worked when she could, and\r\nshe starved when she must. You pray that your Granny may have strength\r\nenough left her at the last (she\xe2\x80\x99s strong for an old one, Johnny), to\r\nget up from her bed and run and hide herself and swown to death in a\r\nhole, sooner than fall into the hands of those Cruel Jacks we read of\r\nthat dodge and drive, and worry and weary, and scorn and shame, the\r\ndecent poor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA brilliant success, my Lords and Gentlemen and Honourable Boards to\r\nhave brought it to this in the minds of the best of the poor! Under\r\nsubmission, might it be worth thinking of at any odd time?\r\n\r\nThe fright and abhorrence that Mrs Betty Higden smoothed out of her\r\nstrong face as she ended this diversion, showed how seriously she had\r\nmeant it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And does he work for you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the Secretary, gently bringing the\r\ndiscourse back to Master or Mister Sloppy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty with a good-humoured smile and nod of the head. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nwell too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does he live here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He lives more here than anywhere. He was thought to be no better than a\r\nNatural, and first come to me as a Minder. I made interest with Mr Blogg\r\nthe Beadle to have him as a Minder, seeing him by chance up at church,\r\nand thinking I might do something with him. For he was a weak ricketty\r\ncreetur then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he called by his right name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you see, speaking quite correctly, he has no right name. I always\r\nunderstood he took his name from being found on a Sloppy night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seems an amiable fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless you, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a bit of him,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Betty, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\namiable. So you may judge how amiable he is, by running your eye along\r\nhis heighth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOf an ungainly make was Sloppy. Too much of him longwise, too little of\r\nhim broadwise, and too many sharp angles of him angle-wise. One of those\r\nshambling male human creatures, born to be indiscreetly candid in the\r\nrevelation of buttons; every button he had about him glaring at the\r\npublic to a quite preternatural extent. A considerable capital of knee\r\nand elbow and wrist and ankle, had Sloppy, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\ndispose of it to the best advantage, but was always investing it in\r\nwrong securities, and so getting himself into embarrassed circumstances.\r\nFull-Private Number One in the Awkward Squad of the rank and file of\r\nlife, was Sloppy, and yet had his glimmering notions of standing true to\r\nthe Colours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98concerning Johnny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Johnny, with his chin tucked in and lips pouting, reclined in Betty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlap, concentrating his blue eyes on the visitors and shading them from\r\nobservation with a dimpled arm, old Betty took one of his fresh fat\r\nhands in her withered right, and fell to gently beating it on her\r\nwithered left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Concerning Johnny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you trust the dear child to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, with a face\r\ninviting trust, \xe2\x80\x98he shall have the best of homes, the best of care, the\r\nbest of education, the best of friends. Please God I will be a true good\r\nmother to him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am thankful to you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and the dear child would be thankful if\r\nhe was old enough to understand.\xe2\x80\x99 Still lightly beating the little hand\r\nupon her own. \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the dear child\xe2\x80\x99s light, not if I had\r\nall my life before me instead of a very little of it. But I hope you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t take it ill that I cleave to the child closer than words can tell,\r\nfor he\xe2\x80\x99s the last living thing left me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it ill, my dear soul? Is it likely? And you so tender of him as to\r\nbring him home here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, still with that light beat upon her hard\r\nrough hand, \xe2\x80\x98so many of them on my lap. And they are all gone but this\r\none! I am ashamed to seem so selfish, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t really mean it. It\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe the making of his fortune, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a gentleman when I am dead.\r\nI--I--don\xe2\x80\x99t know what comes over me. I--try against it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t notice\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99 The light beat stopped, the resolute mouth gave way, and the fine\r\nstrong old face broke up into weakness and tears.\r\n\r\nNow, greatly to the relief of the visitors, the emotional Sloppy no\r\nsooner beheld his patroness in this condition, than, throwing back his\r\nhead and throwing open his mouth, he lifted up his voice and bellowed.\r\nThis alarming note of something wrong instantly terrified Toddles and\r\nPoddles, who were no sooner heard to roar surprisingly, than Johnny,\r\ncurving himself the wrong way and striking out at Mrs Boffin with a pair\r\nof indifferent shoes, became a prey to despair. The absurdity of the\r\nsituation put its pathos to the rout. Mrs Betty Higden was herself in\r\na moment, and brought them all to order with that speed, that Sloppy,\r\nstopping short in a polysyllabic bellow, transferred his energy to\r\nthe mangle, and had taken several penitential turns before he could be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there, there!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, almost regarding her kind self\r\nas the most ruthless of women. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing is going to be done. Nobody need\r\nbe frightened. We\xe2\x80\x99re all comfortable; ain\xe2\x80\x99t we, Mrs Higden?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure and certain we are,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Betty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there really is no hurry, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin in a lower\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x98Take time to think of it, my good creature!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you fear ME no more, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty; \xe2\x80\x98I thought of it for\r\ngood yesterday. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what come over me just now, but it\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\ncome again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, Johnny shall have more time to think of it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs\r\nBoffin; \xe2\x80\x98the pretty child shall have time to get used to it. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget him more used to it, if you think well of it; won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBetty undertook that, cheerfully and readily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, looking radiantly about her, \xe2\x80\x98we want to make\r\neverybody happy, not dismal!--And perhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind letting me\r\nknow how used to it you begin to get, and how it all goes on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Sloppy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Higden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this gentleman who has come with me will pay him for his trouble,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98And Mr Sloppy, whenever you come to my house, be\r\nsure you never go away without having had a good dinner of meat, beer,\r\nvegetables, and pudding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis still further brightened the face of affairs; for, the highly\r\nsympathetic Sloppy, first broadly staring and grinning, and then roaring\r\nwith laughter, Toddles and Poddles followed suit, and Johnny trumped\r\nthe trick. T and P considering these favourable circumstances for\r\nthe resumption of that dramatic descent upon Johnny, again came\r\nacross-country hand-in-hand upon a buccaneering expedition; and this\r\nhaving been fought out in the chimney corner behind Mrs Higden\xe2\x80\x99s chair,\r\nwith great valour on both sides, those desperate pirates returned\r\nhand-in-hand to their stools, across the dry bed of a mountain torrent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must tell me what I can do for you, Betty my friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs\r\nBoffin confidentially, \xe2\x80\x98if not to-day, next time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you all the same, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, but I want nothing for myself. I can\r\nwork. I\xe2\x80\x99m strong. I can walk twenty mile if I\xe2\x80\x99m put to it.\xe2\x80\x99 Old Betty\r\nwas proud, and said it with a sparkle in her bright eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but there are some little comforts that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the worse\r\nfor,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Bless ye, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born a lady any more than\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98that you were born a lady, and\r\na true one, or there never was a lady born. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take anything\r\nfrom you, my dear. I never did take anything from any one. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not grateful, but I love to earn it better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I only spoke of little things, or I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken the liberty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBetty put her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s hand to her lips, in acknowledgment of the\r\ndelicate answer. Wonderfully upright her figure was, and wonderfully\r\nself-reliant her look, as, standing facing her visitor, she explained\r\nherself further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I could have kept the dear child, without the dread that\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nupon me of his coming to that fate I have spoken of, I could never have\r\nparted with him, even to you. For I love him, I love him, I love him! I\r\nlove my husband long dead and gone, in him; I love my children dead and\r\ngone, in him; I love my young and hopeful days dead and gone, in him. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell that love, and look you in your bright kind face. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfree gift. I am in want of nothing. When my strength fails me, if I\r\ncan but die out quick and quiet, I shall be quite content. I have stood\r\nbetween my dead and that shame I have spoken of; and it has been kept\r\noff from every one of them. Sewed into my gown,\xe2\x80\x99 with her hand upon\r\nher breast, \xe2\x80\x98is just enough to lay me in the grave. Only see that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrightly spent, so as I may rest free to the last from that cruelty and\r\ndisgrace, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have done much more than a little thing for me, and\r\nall that in this present world my heart is set upon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Betty Higden\xe2\x80\x99s visitor pressed her hand. There was no more breaking\r\nup of the strong old face into weakness. My Lords and Gentlemen and\r\nHonourable Boards, it really was as composed as our own faces, and\r\nalmost as dignified.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Johnny was to be inveigled into occupying a temporary\r\nposition on Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s lap. It was not until he had been piqued into\r\ncompetition with the two diminutive Minders, by seeing them successively\r\nraised to that post and retire from it without injury, that he could be\r\nby any means induced to leave Mrs Betty Higden\xe2\x80\x99s skirts; towards which\r\nhe exhibited, even when in Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, strong yearnings,\r\nspiritual and bodily; the former expressed in a very gloomy visage,\r\nthe latter in extended arms. However, a general description of the\r\ntoy-wonders lurking in Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house, so far conciliated this\r\nworldly-minded orphan as to induce him to stare at her frowningly,\r\nwith a fist in his mouth, and even at length to chuckle when a\r\nrichly-caparisoned horse on wheels, with a miraculous gift of cantering\r\nto cake-shops, was mentioned. This sound being taken up by the Minders,\r\nswelled into a rapturous trio which gave general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSo, the interview was considered very successful, and Mrs Boffin was\r\npleased, and all were satisfied. Not least of all, Sloppy, who undertook\r\nto conduct the visitors back by the best way to the Three Magpies, and\r\nwhom the hammer-headed young man much despised.\r\n\r\nThis piece of business thus put in train, the Secretary drove Mrs Boffin\r\nback to the Bower, and found employment for himself at the new house\r\nuntil evening. Whether, when evening came, he took a way to his lodgings\r\nthat led through fields, with any design of finding Miss Bella Wilfer\r\nin those fields, is not so certain as that she regularly walked there at\r\nthat hour.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, it is certain that there she was.\r\n\r\nNo longer in mourning, Miss Bella was dressed in as pretty colours as\r\nshe could muster. There is no denying that she was as pretty as they,\r\nand that she and the colours went very prettily together. She was\r\nreading as she walked, and of course it is to be inferred, from her\r\nshowing no knowledge of Mr Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s approach, that she did not know\r\nhe was approaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Bella, raising her eyes from her book, when he stopped\r\nbefore her. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only I. A fine evening!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, looking coldly round. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it is, now you\r\nmention it. I have not been thinking of the evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So intent upon your book?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ye-e-es,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bella, with a drawl of indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A love story, Miss Wilfer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear no, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reading it. It\xe2\x80\x99s more about money than\r\nanything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And does it say that money is better than anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, \xe2\x80\x98I forget what it says, but you can find\r\nout for yourself if you like, Mr Rokesmith. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it any more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary took the book--she had fluttered the leaves as if it were\r\na fan--and walked beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am charged with a message for you, Miss Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible, I think!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with another drawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From Mrs Boffin. She desired me to assure you of the pleasure she has\r\nin finding that she will be ready to receive you in another week or two\r\nat furthest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella turned her head towards him, with her prettily-insolent eyebrows\r\nraised, and her eyelids drooping. As much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98How did YOU come\r\nby the message, pray?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been waiting for an opportunity of telling you that I am Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am as wise as ever,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Bella, loftily, \xe2\x80\x98for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\na Secretary is. Not that it signifies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA covert glance at her face, as he walked beside her, showed him that\r\nshe had not expected his ready assent to that proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then are you going to be always there, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 she inquired, as\r\nif that would be a drawback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always? No. Very much there? Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 drawled Bella, in a tone of mortification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But my position there as Secretary, will be very different from yours\r\nas guest. You will know little or nothing about me. I shall transact\r\nthe business: you will transact the pleasure. I shall have my salary to\r\nearn; you will have nothing to do but to enjoy and attract.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Attract, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, again with her eyebrows raised, and her\r\neyelids drooping. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout replying on this point, Mr Rokesmith went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me; when I first saw you in your black dress--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 was Miss Bella\xe2\x80\x99s mental exclamation. \xe2\x80\x98What did I say to them\r\nat home? Everybody noticed that ridiculous mourning.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I first saw you in your black dress, I was at a loss to account\r\nfor that distinction between yourself and your family. I hope it was not\r\nimpertinent to speculate upon it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Bella, haughtily. \xe2\x80\x98But you ought to\r\nknow best how you speculated upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith inclined his head in a deprecatory manner, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since I have been entrusted with Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, I have\r\nnecessarily come to understand the little mystery. I venture to remark\r\nthat I feel persuaded that much of your loss may be repaired. I\r\nspeak, of course, merely of wealth, Miss Wilfer. The loss of a perfect\r\nstranger, whose worth, or worthlessness, I cannot estimate--nor you\r\neither--is beside the question. But this excellent gentleman and lady\r\nare so full of simplicity, so full of generosity, so inclined towards\r\nyou, and so desirous to--how shall I express it?--to make amends for\r\ntheir good fortune, that you have only to respond.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he watched her with another covert look, he saw a certain ambitious\r\ntriumph in her face which no assumed coldness could conceal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As we have been brought under one roof by an accidental combination of\r\ncircumstances, which oddly extends itself to the new relations before\r\nus, I have taken the liberty of saying these few words. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconsider them intrusive I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary with deference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, Mr Rokesmith, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what I consider them,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the\r\nyoung lady. \xe2\x80\x98They are perfectly new to me, and may be founded altogether\r\non your own imagination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese same fields were opposite the Wilfer premises. The discreet\r\nMrs Wilfer now looking out of window and beholding her daughter in\r\nconference with her lodger, instantly tied up her head and came out for\r\na casual walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been telling Miss Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Rokesmith, as the majestic\r\nlady came stalking up, \xe2\x80\x98that I have become, by a curious chance, Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary or man of business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, waving her gloves in her chronic\r\nstate of dignity, and vague ill-usage, \xe2\x80\x98the honour of any intimate\r\nacquaintance with Mr Boffin, and it is not for me to congratulate that\r\ngentleman on the acquisition he has made.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A poor one enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98the merits of Mr Boffin may be highly\r\ndistinguished--may be more distinguished than the countenance of Mrs\r\nBoffin would imply--but it were the insanity of humility to deem him\r\nworthy of a better assistant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very good. I have also been telling Miss Wilfer that she is\r\nexpected very shortly at the new residence in town.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having tacitly consented,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, with a grand shrug of her\r\nshoulders, and another wave of her gloves, \xe2\x80\x98to my child\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of\r\nthe proffered attentions of Mrs Boffin, I interpose no objection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Miss Bella offered the remonstrance: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense, ma,\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peace!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, ma, I am not going to be made so absurd. Interposing objections!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Wilfer, with a vast access of grandeur, \xe2\x80\x98that I am\r\nNOT going to interpose objections. If Mrs Boffin (to whose countenance\r\nno disciple of Lavater could possibly for a single moment subscribe),\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwith a shiver, \xe2\x80\x98seeks to illuminate her new residence in town with the\r\nattractions of a child of mine, I am content that she should be favoured\r\nby the company of a child of mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You use the word, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I have myself used,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, with a\r\nglance at Bella, \xe2\x80\x98when you speak of Miss Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s attractions there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, with dreadful solemnity, \xe2\x80\x98but I had\r\nnot finished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray excuse me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was about to say,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mrs Wilfer, who clearly had not had\r\nthe faintest idea of saying anything more: \xe2\x80\x98that when I use the term\r\nattractions, I do so with the qualification that I do not mean it in any\r\nway whatever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe excellent lady delivered this luminous elucidation of her views\r\nwith an air of greatly obliging her hearers, and greatly distinguishing\r\nherself. Whereat Miss Bella laughed a scornful little laugh and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite enough about this, I am sure, on all sides. Have the goodness, Mr\r\nRokesmith, to give my love to Mrs Boffin--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Compliments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Love!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bella, with a little stamp of her foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, monotonously. \xe2\x80\x98Compliments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Say Miss Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s love, and Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s compliments,\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary\r\nproposed, as a compromise.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I shall be very glad to come when she is ready for me. The sooner,\r\nthe better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One last word, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98before descending to the\r\nfamily apartment. I trust that as a child of mine you will ever be\r\nsensible that it will be graceful in you, when associating with Mr\r\nand Mrs Boffin upon equal terms, to remember that the Secretary, Mr\r\nRokesmith, as your father\xe2\x80\x99s lodger, has a claim on your good word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe condescension with which Mrs Wilfer delivered this proclamation of\r\npatronage, was as wonderful as the swiftness with which the lodger\r\nhad lost caste in the Secretary. He smiled as the mother retired down\r\nstairs; but his face fell, as the daughter followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So insolent, so trivial, so capricious, so mercenary, so careless, so\r\nhard to touch, so hard to turn!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, bitterly.\r\n\r\nAnd added as he went upstairs. \xe2\x80\x98And yet so pretty, so pretty!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd added presently, as he walked to and fro in his room. \xe2\x80\x98And if she\r\nknew!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe knew that he was shaking the house by his walking to and fro; and\r\nshe declared it another of the miseries of being poor, that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget rid of a haunting Secretary, stump--stump--stumping overhead in the\r\ndark, like a Ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nA DISMAL SWAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the blooming summer days, behold Mr and Mrs Boffin\r\nestablished in the eminently aristocratic family mansion, and behold\r\nall manner of crawling, creeping, fluttering, and buzzing creatures,\r\nattracted by the gold dust of the Golden Dustman!\r\n\r\nForemost among those leaving cards at the eminently aristocratic door\r\nbefore it is quite painted, are the Veneerings: out of breath, one\r\nmight imagine, from the impetuosity of their rush to the eminently\r\naristocratic steps. One copper-plate Mrs Veneering, two copper-plate\r\nMr Veneerings, and a connubial copper-plate Mr and Mrs Veneering,\r\nrequesting the honour of Mr and Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s company at dinner with\r\nthe utmost Analytical solemnities. The enchanting Lady Tippins leaves a\r\ncard. Twemlow leaves cards. A tall custard-coloured phaeton tooling up\r\nin a solemn manner leaves four cards, to wit, a couple of Mr Podsnaps, a\r\nMrs Podsnap, and a Miss Podsnap. All the world and his wife and daughter\r\nleave cards. Sometimes the world\xe2\x80\x99s wife has so many daughters, that her\r\ncard reads rather like a Miscellaneous Lot at an Auction; comprising Mrs\r\nTapkins, Miss Tapkins, Miss Frederica Tapkins, Miss Antonina Tapkins,\r\nMiss Malvina Tapkins, and Miss Euphemia Tapkins; at the same time,\r\nthe same lady leaves the card of Mrs Henry George Alfred Swoshle, NEE\r\nTapkins; also, a card, Mrs Tapkins at Home, Wednesdays, Music, Portland\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\nMiss Bella Wilfer becomes an inmate, for an indefinite period, of the\r\neminently aristocratic dwelling. Mrs Boffin bears Miss Bella away to\r\nher Milliner\xe2\x80\x99s and Dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s, and she gets beautifully dressed. The\r\nVeneerings find with swift remorse that they have omitted to invite Miss\r\nBella Wilfer. One Mrs Veneering and one Mr and Mrs Veneering requesting\r\nthat additional honour, instantly do penance in white cardboard on\r\nthe hall table. Mrs Tapkins likewise discovers her omission, and\r\nwith promptitude repairs it; for herself; for Miss Tapkins, for Miss\r\nFrederica Tapkins, for Miss Antonina Tapkins, for Miss Malvina Tapkins,\r\nand for Miss Euphemia Tapkins. Likewise, for Mrs Henry George Alfred\r\nSwoshle NEE Tapkins. Likewise, for Mrs Tapkins at Home, Wednesdays,\r\nMusic, Portland Place.\r\n\r\nTradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s books hunger, and tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s mouths water, for the gold\r\ndust of the Golden Dustman. As Mrs Boffin and Miss Wilfer drive out, or\r\nas Mr Boffin walks out at his jog-trot pace, the fishmonger pulls off\r\nhis hat with an air of reverence founded on conviction. His men cleanse\r\ntheir fingers on their woollen aprons before presuming to touch their\r\nforeheads to Mr Boffin or Lady. The gaping salmon and the golden mullet\r\nlying on the slab seem to turn up their eyes sideways, as they would\r\nturn up their hands if they had any, in worshipping admiration. The\r\nbutcher, though a portly and a prosperous man, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\r\nwith himself; so anxious is he to express humility when discovered by\r\nthe passing Boffins taking the air in a mutton grove. Presents are made\r\nto the Boffin servants, and bland strangers with business-cards\r\nmeeting said servants in the street, offer hypothetical corruption. As,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Supposing I was to be favoured with an order from Mr Boffin, my dear\r\nfriend, it would be worth my while\xe2\x80\x99--to do a certain thing that I hope\r\nmight not prove wholly disagreeable to your feelings.\r\n\r\nBut no one knows so well as the Secretary, who opens and reads the\r\nletters, what a set is made at the man marked by a stroke of notoriety.\r\nOh the varieties of dust for ocular use, offered in exchange for the\r\ngold dust of the Golden Dustman! Fifty-seven churches to be erected with\r\nhalf-crowns, forty-two parsonage houses to be repaired with shillings,\r\nseven-and-twenty organs to be built with halfpence, twelve hundred\r\nchildren to be brought up on postage stamps. Not that a half-crown,\r\nshilling, halfpenny, or postage stamp, would be particularly acceptable\r\nfrom Mr Boffin, but that it is so obvious he is the man to make up the\r\ndeficiency. And then the charities, my Christian brother! And mostly in\r\ndifficulties, yet mostly lavish, too, in the expensive articles of print\r\nand paper. Large fat private double letter, sealed with ducal coronet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire. My Dear Sir,--Having consented to preside\r\nat the forthcoming Annual Dinner of the Family Party Fund, and feeling\r\ndeeply impressed with the immense usefulness of that noble Institution\r\nand the great importance of its being supported by a List of Stewards\r\nthat shall prove to the public the interest taken in it by popular and\r\ndistinguished men, I have undertaken to ask you to become a Steward on\r\nthat occasion. Soliciting your favourable reply before the 14th instant,\r\nI am, My Dear Sir, Your faithful Servant, LINSEED. P.S. The Steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfee is limited to three Guineas.\xe2\x80\x99 Friendly this, on the part of the Duke\r\nof Linseed (and thoughtful in the postscript), only lithographed by\r\nthe hundred and presenting but a pale individuality of an address to\r\nNicodemus Boffin, Esquire, in quite another hand. It takes two noble\r\nEarls and a Viscount, combined, to inform Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire,\r\nin an equally flattering manner, that an estimable lady in the West of\r\nEngland has offered to present a purse containing twenty pounds, to\r\nthe Society for Granting Annuities to Unassuming Members of the Middle\r\nClasses, if twenty individuals will previously present purses of one\r\nhundred pounds each. And those benevolent noblemen very kindly point out\r\nthat if Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, should wish to present two or more\r\npurses, it will not be inconsistent with the design of the estimable\r\nlady in the West of England, provided each purse be coupled with the\r\nname of some member of his honoured and respected family.\r\n\r\nThese are the corporate beggars. But there are, besides, the individual\r\nbeggars; and how does the heart of the Secretary fail him when he has to\r\ncope with THEM! And they must be coped with to some extent, because they\r\nall enclose documents (they call their scraps documents; but they are,\r\nas to papers deserving the name, what minced veal is to a calf), the\r\nnon-return of which would be their ruin. That is say, they are utterly\r\nruined now, but they would be more utterly ruined then. Among these\r\ncorrespondents are several daughters of general officers, long\r\naccustomed to every luxury of life (except spelling), who little\r\nthought, when their gallant fathers waged war in the Peninsula,\r\nthat they would ever have to appeal to those whom Providence, in its\r\ninscrutable wisdom, has blessed with untold gold, and from among whom\r\nthey select the name of Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, for a maiden effort\r\nin this wise, understanding that he has such a heart as never was. The\r\nSecretary learns, too, that confidence between man and wife would seem\r\nto obtain but rarely when virtue is in distress, so numerous are the\r\nwives who take up their pens to ask Mr Boffin for money without the\r\nknowledge of their devoted husbands, who would never permit it; while,\r\non the other hand, so numerous are the husbands who take up their pens\r\nto ask Mr Boffin for money without the knowledge of their devoted\r\nwives, who would instantly go out of their senses if they had the least\r\nsuspicion of the circumstance. There are the inspired beggars, too.\r\nThese were sitting, only yesterday evening, musing over a fragment of\r\ncandle which must soon go out and leave them in the dark for the rest\r\nof their nights, when surely some Angel whispered the name of Nicodemus\r\nBoffin, Esquire, to their souls, imparting rays of hope, nay\r\nconfidence, to which they had long been strangers! Akin to these are the\r\nsuggestively-befriended beggars. They were partaking of a cold potato\r\nand water by the flickering and gloomy light of a lucifer-match, in\r\ntheir lodgings (rent considerably in arrear, and heartless landlady\r\nthreatening expulsion \xe2\x80\x98like a dog\xe2\x80\x99 into the streets), when a gifted\r\nfriend happening to look in, said, \xe2\x80\x98Write immediately to Nicodemus\r\nBoffin, Esquire,\xe2\x80\x99 and would take no denial. There are the nobly\r\nindependent beggars too. These, in the days of their abundance, ever\r\nregarded gold as dross, and have not yet got over that only impediment\r\nin the way of their amassing wealth, but they want no dross from\r\nNicodemus Boffin, Esquire; No, Mr Boffin; the world may term it pride,\r\npaltry pride if you will, but they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it if you offered it;\r\na loan, sir--for fourteen weeks to the day, interest calculated at the\r\nrate of five per cent per annum, to be bestowed upon any charitable\r\ninstitution you may name--is all they want of you, and if you have the\r\nmeanness to refuse it, count on being despised by these great spirits.\r\nThere are the beggars of punctual business-habits too. These will\r\nmake an end of themselves at a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday, if no\r\nPost-office order is in the interim received from Nicodemus Boffin,\r\nEsquire; arriving after a quarter to one P.M. on Tuesday, it need not\r\nbe sent, as they will then (having made an exact memorandum of the\r\nheartless circumstances) be \xe2\x80\x98cold in death.\xe2\x80\x99 There are the beggars on\r\nhorseback too, in another sense from the sense of the proverb. These\r\nare mounted and ready to start on the highway to affluence. The goal is\r\nbefore them, the road is in the best condition, their spurs are on,\r\nthe steed is willing, but, at the last moment, for want of some special\r\nthing--a clock, a violin, an astronomical telescope, an electrifying\r\nmachine--they must dismount for ever, unless they receive its equivalent\r\nin money from Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire. Less given to detail are the\r\nbeggars who make sporting ventures. These, usually to be addressed\r\nin reply under initials at a country post-office, inquire in feminine\r\nhands, Dare one who cannot disclose herself to Nicodemus Boffin,\r\nEsquire, but whose name might startle him were it revealed, solicit\r\nthe immediate advance of two hundred pounds from unexpected riches\r\nexercising their noblest privilege in the trust of a common humanity?\r\n\r\nIn such a Dismal Swamp does the new house stand, and through it does\r\nthe Secretary daily struggle breast-high. Not to mention all the people\r\nalive who have made inventions that won\xe2\x80\x99t act, and all the jobbers who\r\njob in all the jobberies jobbed; though these may be regarded as the\r\nAlligators of the Dismal Swamp, and are always lying by to drag the\r\nGolden Dustman under.\r\n\r\nBut the old house. There are no designs against the Golden Dustman\r\nthere? There are no fish of the shark tribe in the Bower waters? Perhaps\r\nnot. Still, Wegg is established there, and would seem, judged by his\r\nsecret proceedings, to cherish a notion of making a discovery. For,\r\nwhen a man with a wooden leg lies prone on his stomach to peep under\r\nbedsteads; and hops up ladders, like some extinct bird, to survey the\r\ntops of presses and cupboards; and provides himself an iron rod which he\r\nis always poking and prodding into dust-mounds; the probability is that\r\nhe expects to find something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE SECOND -- BIRDS OF A FEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nOF AN EDUCATIONAL CHARACTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a\r\nbook--the streets being, for pupils of his degree, the great Preparatory\r\nEstablishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned\r\nwithout and before book--was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard. Its\r\natmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable; it was crowded, noisy,\r\nand confusing; half the pupils dropped asleep, or fell into a state of\r\nwaking stupefaction; the other half kept them in either condition by\r\nmaintaining a monotonous droning noise, as if they were performing, out\r\nof time and tune, on a ruder sort of bagpipe. The teachers, animated\r\nsolely by good intentions, had no idea of execution, and a lamentable\r\njumble was the upshot of their kind endeavours.\r\n\r\nIt was a school for all ages, and for both sexes. The latter were kept\r\napart, and the former were partitioned off into square assortments. But,\r\nall the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every\r\npupil was childish and innocent. This pretence, much favoured by the\r\nlady-visitors, led to the ghastliest absurdities. Young women old in\r\nthe vices of the commonest and worst life, were expected to profess\r\nthemselves enthralled by the good child\xe2\x80\x99s book, the Adventures of\r\nLittle Margery, who resided in the village cottage by the mill; severely\r\nreproved and morally squashed the miller, when she was five and he was\r\nfifty; divided her porridge with singing birds; denied herself a new\r\nnankeen bonnet, on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen\r\nbonnets, neither did the sheep who ate them; who plaited straw and\r\ndelivered the dreariest orations to all comers, at all sorts of\r\nunseasonable times. So, unwieldy young dredgers and hulking mudlarks\r\nwere referred to the experiences of Thomas Twopence, who, having\r\nresolved not to rob (under circumstances of uncommon atrocity) his\r\nparticular friend and benefactor, of eighteenpence, presently came into\r\nsupernatural possession of three and sixpence, and lived a shining light\r\never afterwards. (Note, that the benefactor came to no good.) Several\r\nswaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain;\r\nit always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons,\r\nthat you were to do good, not because it WAS good, but because you were\r\nto make a good thing of it. Contrariwise, the adult pupils were taught\r\nto read (if they could learn) out of the New Testament; and by dint of\r\nstumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the\r\nparticular syllables coming round to their turn, were as absolutely\r\nignorant of the sublime history, as if they had never seen or heard of\r\nit. An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a school,\r\nin fact, where black spirits and grey, red spirits and white, jumbled\r\njumbled jumbled jumbled, jumbled every night. And particularly every\r\nSunday night. For then, an inclined plane of unfortunate infants would\r\nbe handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with good\r\nintentions, whom nobody older would endure. Who, taking his stand on\r\nthe floor before them as chief executioner, would be attended by a\r\nconventional volunteer boy as executioner\xe2\x80\x99s assistant. When and where it\r\nfirst became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant\r\nin a class must have its face smoothed downward with a hot hand, or when\r\nand where the conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in\r\noperation, and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it,\r\nmatters not. It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth,\r\nand it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants,\r\nyawning infants, restless infants, whimpering infants, and smooth their\r\nwretched faces; sometimes with one hand, as if he were anointing them\r\nfor a whisker; sometimes with both hands, applied after the fashion of\r\nblinkers. And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a\r\nmortal hour; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr, let\r\nus say, for example, about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre; and\r\nrepeating the word Sepulchre (commonly used among infants) five hundred\r\ntimes, and never once hinting what it meant; the conventional boy\r\nsmoothing away right and left, as an infallible commentary; the whole\r\nhot-bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles, rashes,\r\nwhooping-cough, fever, and stomach disorders, as if they were assembled\r\nin High Market for the purpose.\r\n\r\nEven in this temple of good intentions, an exceptionally sharp boy\r\nexceptionally determined to learn, could learn something, and, having\r\nlearned it, could impart it much better than the teachers; as being\r\nmore knowing than they, and not at the disadvantage in which they stood\r\ntowards the shrewder pupils. In this way it had come about that Charley\r\nHexam had risen in the jumble, taught in the jumble, and been received\r\nfrom the jumble into a better school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you want to go and see your sister, Hexam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, Mr Headstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have half a mind to go with you. Where does your sister live?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, she is not settled yet, Mr Headstone. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nher till she is settled, if it was all the same to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Bradley Headstone, highly certificated\r\nstipendiary schoolmaster, drew his right forefinger through one of the\r\nbuttonholes of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and looked at it attentively. \xe2\x80\x98I hope\r\nyour sister may be good company for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you doubt it, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not say I doubted it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir; you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone looked at his finger again, took it out of the\r\nbuttonhole and looked at it closer, bit the side of it and looked at it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Hexam, you will be one of us. In good time you are sure to\r\npass a creditable examination and become one of us. Then the question\r\nis--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy waited so long for the question, while the schoolmaster looked\r\nat a new side of his finger, and bit it, and looked at it again, that at\r\nlength the boy repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The question is, sir--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whether you had not better leave well alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it well to leave my sister alone, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not say so, because I do not know. I put it to you. I ask you to\r\nthink of it. I want you to consider. You know how well you are doing\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all, she got me here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, with a struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perceiving the necessity of it,\xe2\x80\x99 acquiesced the schoolmaster, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nmaking up her mind fully to the separation. Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy, with a return of that former reluctance or struggle or whatever\r\nit was, seemed to debate with himself. At length he said, raising his\r\neyes to the master\xe2\x80\x99s face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come with me and see her, Mr Headstone, though she is not\r\nsettled. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d come with me, and take her in the rough, and judge\r\nher for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure you would not like,\xe2\x80\x99 asked the schoolmaster, \xe2\x80\x98to prepare\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My sister Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, proudly, \xe2\x80\x98wants no preparing, Mr\r\nHeadstone. What she is, she is, and shows herself to be. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\npretending about my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis confidence in her, sat more easily upon him than the indecision with\r\nwhich he had twice contended. It was his better nature to be true to\r\nher, if it were his worse nature to be wholly selfish. And as yet the\r\nbetter nature had the stronger hold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I can spare the evening,\xe2\x80\x99 said the schoolmaster. \xe2\x80\x98I am ready to\r\nwalk with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Mr Headstone. And I am ready to go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone, in his decent black coat and waistcoat, and decent\r\nwhite shirt, and decent formal black tie, and decent pantaloons of\r\npepper and salt, with his decent silver watch in his pocket and its\r\ndecent hair-guard round his neck, looked a thoroughly decent young man\r\nof six-and-twenty. He was never seen in any other dress, and yet there\r\nwas a certain stiffness in his manner of wearing this, as if there were\r\na want of adaptation between him and it, recalling some mechanics in\r\ntheir holiday clothes. He had acquired mechanically a great store of\r\nteacher\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. He could do mental arithmetic mechanically, sing\r\nat sight mechanically, blow various wind instruments mechanically, even\r\nplay the great church organ mechanically. From his early childhood up,\r\nhis mind had been a place of mechanical stowage. The arrangement of\r\nhis wholesale warehouse, so that it might be always ready to meet the\r\ndemands of retail dealers history here, geography there, astronomy to\r\nthe right, political economy to the left--natural history, the physical\r\nsciences, figures, music, the lower mathematics, and what not, all in\r\ntheir several places--this care had imparted to his countenance a look\r\nof care; while the habit of questioning and being questioned had given\r\nhim a suspicious manner, or a manner that would be better described as\r\none of lying in wait. There was a kind of settled trouble in the face.\r\nIt was the face belonging to a naturally slow or inattentive intellect\r\nthat had toiled hard to get what it had won, and that had to hold it now\r\nthat it was gotten. He always seemed to be uneasy lest anything should\r\nbe missing from his mental warehouse, and taking stock to assure\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSuppression of so much to make room for so much, had given him a\r\nconstrained manner, over and above. Yet there was enough of what was\r\nanimal, and of what was fiery (though smouldering), still visible in\r\nhim, to suggest that if young Bradley Headstone, when a pauper lad, had\r\nchanced to be told off for the sea, he would not have been the last man\r\nin a ship\xe2\x80\x99s crew. Regarding that origin of his, he was proud, moody, and\r\nsullen, desiring it to be forgotten. And few people knew of it.\r\n\r\nIn some visits to the Jumble his attention had been attracted to this\r\nboy Hexam. An undeniable boy for a pupil-teacher; an undeniable boy\r\nto do credit to the master who should bring him on. Combined with this\r\nconsideration, there may have been some thought of the pauper lad now\r\nnever to be mentioned. Be that how it might, he had with pains gradually\r\nworked the boy into his own school, and procured him some offices to\r\ndischarge there, which were repaid with food and lodging. Such were the\r\ncircumstances that had brought together, Bradley Headstone and young\r\nCharley Hexam that autumn evening. Autumn, because full half a year had\r\ncome and gone since the bird of prey lay dead upon the river-shore.\r\n\r\nThe schools--for they were twofold, as the sexes--were down in that\r\ndistrict of the flat country tending to the Thames, where Kent and\r\nSurrey meet, and where the railways still bestride the market-gardens\r\nthat will soon die under them. The schools were newly built, and there\r\nwere so many like them all over the country, that one might have thought\r\nthe whole were but one restless edifice with the locomotive gift of\r\nAladdin\xe2\x80\x99s palace. They were in a neighbourhood which looked like a toy\r\nneighbourhood taken in blocks out of a box by a child of particularly\r\nincoherent mind, and set up anyhow; here, one side of a new street;\r\nthere, a large solitary public-house facing nowhere; here, another\r\nunfinished street already in ruins; there, a church; here, an immense\r\nnew warehouse; there, a dilapidated old country villa; then, a medley\r\nof black ditch, sparkling cucumber-frame, rank field, richly cultivated\r\nkitchen-garden, brick viaduct, arch-spanned canal, and disorder of\r\nfrowziness and fog. As if the child had given the table a kick, and gone\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nBut, even among school-buildings, school-teachers, and school-pupils,\r\nall according to pattern and all engendered in the light of the latest\r\nGospel according to Monotony, the older pattern into which so many\r\nfortunes have been shaped for good and evil, comes out. It came out in\r\nMiss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering her flowers, as Mr Bradley\r\nHeadstone walked forth. It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress,\r\nwatering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her\r\nsmall official residence, with little windows like the eyes in needles,\r\nand little doors like the covers of school-books.\r\n\r\nSmall, shining, neat, methodical, and buxom was Miss Peecher;\r\ncherry-cheeked and tuneful of voice. A little pincushion, a little\r\nhousewife, a little book, a little workbox, a little set of tables and\r\nweights and measures, and a little woman, all in one. She could write\r\na little essay on any subject, exactly a slate long, beginning at the\r\nleft-hand top of one side and ending at the right-hand bottom of the\r\nother, and the essay should be strictly according to rule. If Mr Bradley\r\nHeadstone had addressed a written proposal of marriage to her, she would\r\nprobably have replied in a complete little essay on the theme exactly a\r\nslate long, but would certainly have replied Yes. For she loved him. The\r\ndecent hair-guard that went round his neck and took care of his decent\r\nsilver watch was an object of envy to her. So would Miss Peecher have\r\ngone round his neck and taken care of him. Of him, insensible. Because\r\nhe did not love Miss Peecher.\r\n\r\nMiss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s favourite pupil, who assisted her in her little\r\nhousehold, was in attendance with a can of water to replenish her little\r\nwatering-pot, and sufficiently divined the state of Miss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffections to feel it necessary that she herself should love young\r\nCharley Hexam. So, there was a double palpitation among the double\r\nstocks and double wall-flowers, when the master and the boy looked over\r\nthe little gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fine evening, Miss Peecher,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A very fine evening, Mr Headstone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Peecher. \xe2\x80\x98Are you taking\r\na walk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hexam and I are going to take a long walk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charming weather,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Miss Peecher, \xe2\x80\x98FOR a long walk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ours is rather on business than mere pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Master. Miss\r\nPeecher inverting her watering-pot, and very carefully shaking out the\r\nfew last drops over a flower, as if there were some special virtue in\r\nthem which would make it a Jack\xe2\x80\x99s beanstalk before morning, called for\r\nreplenishment to her pupil, who had been speaking to the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, Miss Peecher,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, Mr Headstone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Mistress.\r\n\r\nThe pupil had been, in her state of pupilage, so imbued with the\r\nclass-custom of stretching out an arm, as if to hail a cab or omnibus,\r\nwhenever she found she had an observation on hand to offer to Miss\r\nPeecher, that she often did it in their domestic relations; and she did\r\nit now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Peecher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Hexam said they were going to see his sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that can\xe2\x80\x99t be, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Peecher: \xe2\x80\x98because Mr\r\nHeadstone can have no business with HER.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Anne again hailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s business?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Peecher. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of that. Not that it\r\nmatters at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Anne again hailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They say she\xe2\x80\x99s very handsome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mary Anne, Mary Anne!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Peecher, slightly colouring\r\nand shaking her head, a little out of humour; \xe2\x80\x98how often have I told you\r\nnot to use that vague expression, not to speak in that general way? When\r\nyou say THEY say, what do you mean? Part of speech They?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Anne hooked her right arm behind her in her left hand, as being\r\nunder examination, and replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Personal pronoun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Person, They?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Third person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number, They?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plural number.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then how many do you mean, Mary Anne? Two? Or more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary Anne, disconcerted now she came\r\nto think of it; \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I mean more than her brother\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x99 As she said it, she unhooked her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I felt convinced of it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Peecher, smiling again. \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\npray, Mary Anne, be careful another time. He says is very different from\r\nthey say, remember. Difference between he says and they say? Give it\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Anne immediately hooked her right arm behind her in her left\r\nhand--an attitude absolutely necessary to the situation--and replied:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One is indicative mood, present tense, third person singular, verb\r\nactive to say. Other is indicative mood, present tense, third person\r\nplural, verb active to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why verb active, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because it takes a pronoun after it in the objective case, Miss\r\nPeecher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Miss Peecher, with encouragement. \xe2\x80\x98In fact,\r\ncould not be better. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to apply it, another time, Mary Anne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis said, Miss Peecher finished the watering of her flowers, and\r\nwent into her little official residence, and took a refresher of the\r\nprincipal rivers and mountains of the world, their breadths, depths, and\r\nheights, before settling the measurements of the body of a dress for her\r\nown personal occupation.\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone and Charley Hexam duly got to the Surrey side of\r\nWestminster Bridge, and crossed the bridge, and made along the Middlesex\r\nshore towards Millbank. In this region are a certain little street\r\ncalled Church Street, and a certain little blind square, called Smith\r\nSquare, in the centre of which last retreat is a very hideous church\r\nwith four towers at the four corners, generally resembling some\r\npetrified monster, frightful and gigantic, on its back with its legs\r\nin the air. They found a tree near by in a corner, and a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforge, and a timber yard, and a dealer\xe2\x80\x99s in old iron. What a rusty\r\nportion of a boiler and a great iron wheel or so meant by lying\r\nhalf-buried in the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s fore-court, nobody seemed to know or to want\r\nto know. Like the Miller of questionable jollity in the song, They cared\r\nfor Nobody, no not they, and Nobody cared for them.\r\n\r\nAfter making the round of this place, and noting that there was a deadly\r\nkind of repose on it, more as though it had taken laudanum than fallen\r\ninto a natural rest, they stopped at the point where the street and the\r\nsquare joined, and where there were some little quiet houses in a row.\r\nTo these Charley Hexam finally led the way, and at one of these stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This must be where my sister lives, sir. This is where she came for a\r\ntemporary lodging, soon after father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How often have you seen her since?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, only twice, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the boy, with his former reluctance;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but that\xe2\x80\x99s as much her doing as mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How does she support herself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was always a fair needlewoman, and she keeps the stockroom of a\r\nseaman\xe2\x80\x99s outfitter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does she ever work at her own lodging here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes; but her regular hours and regular occupation are at their\r\nplace of business, I believe, sir. This is the number.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy knocked at a door, and the door promptly opened with a spring\r\nand a click. A parlour door within a small entry stood open, and\r\ndisclosed a child--a dwarf--a girl--a something--sitting on a little low\r\nold-fashioned arm-chair, which had a kind of little working bench before\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t get up,\xe2\x80\x99 said the child, \xe2\x80\x98because my back\xe2\x80\x99s bad, and my legs\r\nare queer. But I\xe2\x80\x99m the person of the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who else is at home?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charley Hexam, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s at home at present,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the child, with a glib assertion\r\nof her dignity, \xe2\x80\x98except the person of the house. What did you want,\r\nyoung man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wanted to see my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many young men have sisters,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the child. \xe2\x80\x98Give me your name,\r\nyoung man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe queer little figure, and the queer but not ugly little face, with\r\nits bright grey eyes, were so sharp, that the sharpness of the manner\r\nseemed unavoidable. As if, being turned out of that mould, it must be\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hexam is my name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house. \xe2\x80\x98I thought it might be. Your\r\nsister will be in, in about a quarter of an hour. I am very fond of your\r\nsister. She\xe2\x80\x99s my particular friend. Take a seat. And this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, my schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take a seat. And would you please to shut the street door first? I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t very well do it myself; because my back\xe2\x80\x99s so bad, and my legs are\r\nso queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey complied in silence, and the little figure went on with its work of\r\ngumming or gluing together with a camel\xe2\x80\x99s-hair brush certain pieces\r\nof cardboard and thin wood, previously cut into various shapes. The\r\nscissors and knives upon the bench showed that the child herself had cut\r\nthem; and the bright scraps of velvet and silk and ribbon also strewn\r\nupon the bench showed that when duly stuffed (and stuffing too was\r\nthere), she was to cover them smartly. The dexterity of her nimble\r\nfingers was remarkable, and, as she brought two thin edges accurately\r\ntogether by giving them a little bite, she would glance at the visitors\r\nout of the corners of her grey eyes with a look that out-sharpened all\r\nher other sharpness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me the name of my trade, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, after\r\ntaking several of these observations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You make pincushions,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What else do I make?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pen-wipers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! What else do I make? You\xe2\x80\x99re a schoolmaster, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do something,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, pointing to a corner of the little\r\nbench, \xe2\x80\x98with straw; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the person of the house. \xe2\x80\x98I only make pincushions\r\nand pen-wipers, to use up my waste. But my straw really does belong to\r\nmy business. Try again. What do I make with my straw?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dinner-mats?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A schoolmaster, and says dinner-mats! I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a clue to my trade,\r\nin a game of forfeits. I love my love with a B because she\xe2\x80\x99s Beautiful;\r\nI hate my love with a B because she is Brazen; I took her to the sign of\r\nthe Blue Boar, and I treated her with Bonnets; her name\xe2\x80\x99s Bouncer, and\r\nshe lives in Bedlam.--Now, what do I make with my straw?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 bonnets?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine ladies\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house, nodding assent. \xe2\x80\x98Dolls\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a Doll\xe2\x80\x99s Dressmaker.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s a good business?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe person of the house shrugged her shoulders and shook her head. \xe2\x80\x98No.\r\nPoorly paid. And I\xe2\x80\x99m often so pressed for time! I had a doll married,\r\nlast week, and was obliged to work all night. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for me,\r\non account of my back being so bad and my legs so queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey looked at the little creature with a wonder that did not diminish,\r\nand the schoolmaster said: \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry your fine ladies are so\r\ninconsiderate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the way with them,\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house, shrugging her\r\nshoulders again. \xe2\x80\x98And they take no care of their clothes, and they\r\nnever keep to the same fashions a month. I work for a doll with three\r\ndaughters. Bless you, she\xe2\x80\x99s enough to ruin her husband!\xe2\x80\x99 The person of\r\nthe house gave a weird little laugh here, and gave them another look out\r\nof the corners of her eyes. She had an elfin chin that was capable of\r\ngreat expression; and whenever she gave this look, she hitched this chin\r\nup. As if her eyes and her chin worked together on the same wires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you always as busy as you are now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Busier. I\xe2\x80\x99m slack just now. I finished a large mourning order the day\r\nbefore yesterday. Doll I work for, lost a canary-bird.\xe2\x80\x99 The person of\r\nthe house gave another little laugh, and then nodded her head several\r\ntimes, as who should moralize, \xe2\x80\x98Oh this world, this world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you alone all day?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley Headstone. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t any of the\r\nneighbouring children--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, lud!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the person of the house, with a little scream, as\r\nif the word had pricked her. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of children. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nchildren. I know their tricks and their manners.\xe2\x80\x99 She said this with an\r\nangry little shake of her tight fist close before her eyes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it scarcely required the teacher-habit, to perceive that the\r\ndoll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker was inclined to be bitter on the difference between\r\nherself and other children. But both master and pupil understood it so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always running about and screeching, always playing and fighting,\r\nalways skip-skip-skipping on the pavement and chalking it for their\r\ngames! Oh! I know their tricks and their manners!\xe2\x80\x99 Shaking the little\r\nfist as before. \xe2\x80\x98And that\xe2\x80\x99s not all. Ever so often calling names in\r\nthrough a person\xe2\x80\x99s keyhole, and imitating a person\xe2\x80\x99s back and legs. Oh!\r\nI know their tricks and their manners. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99d do, to\r\npunish \xe2\x80\x98em. There\xe2\x80\x99s doors under the church in the Square--black doors,\r\nleading into black vaults. Well! I\xe2\x80\x99d open one of those doors, and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncram \xe2\x80\x98em all in, and then I\xe2\x80\x99d lock the door and through the keyhole I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nblow in pepper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would be the good of blowing in pepper?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charley Hexam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To set \xe2\x80\x98em sneezing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house, \xe2\x80\x98and make their\r\neyes water. And when they were all sneezing and inflamed, I\xe2\x80\x99d mock \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nthrough the keyhole. Just as they, with their tricks and their manners,\r\nmock a person through a person\xe2\x80\x99s keyhole!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAn uncommonly emphatic shake of her little fist close before her eyes,\r\nseemed to ease the mind of the person of the house; for she added\r\nwith recovered composure, \xe2\x80\x98No, no, no. No children for me. Give me\r\ngrown-ups.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to guess the age of this strange creature, for her poor\r\nfigure furnished no clue to it, and her face was at once so young and so\r\nold. Twelve, or at the most thirteen, might be near the mark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always did like grown-ups,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, \xe2\x80\x98and always kept company\r\nwith them. So sensible. Sit so quiet. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go prancing and capering\r\nabout! And I mean always to keep among none but grown-ups till I marry.\r\nI suppose I must make up my mind to marry, one of these days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe listened to a step outside that caught her ear, and there was a soft\r\nknock at the door. Pulling at a handle within her reach, she said,\r\nwith a pleased laugh: \xe2\x80\x98Now here, for instance, is a grown-up that\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nparticular friend!\xe2\x80\x99 and Lizzie Hexam in a black dress entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley! You!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTaking him to her arms in the old way--of which he seemed a little\r\nashamed--she saw no one else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there, there, Liz, all right my dear. See! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Headstone\r\ncome with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer eyes met those of the schoolmaster, who had evidently expected\r\nto see a very different sort of person, and a murmured word or two\r\nof salutation passed between them. She was a little flurried by the\r\nunexpected visit, and the schoolmaster was not at his ease. But he never\r\nwas, quite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told Mr Headstone you were not settled, Liz, but he was so kind as to\r\ntake an interest in coming, and so I brought him. How well you look!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley seemed to think so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Don\xe2\x80\x99t she, don\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x99 cried the person of the house, resuming her\r\noccupation, though the twilight was falling fast. \xe2\x80\x98I believe you she\r\ndoes! But go on with your chat, one and all:\r\n\r\n     You one two three,\r\n     My com-pa-nie,\r\n     And don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n--pointing this impromptu rhyme with three points of her thin\r\nfore-finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect a visit from you, Charley,\xe2\x80\x99 said his sister. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsupposed that if you wanted to see me you would have sent to me,\r\nappointing me to come somewhere near the school, as I did last time.\r\nI saw my brother near the school, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 to Bradley Headstone, \xe2\x80\x98because\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s easier for me to go there, than for him to come here. I work about\r\nmidway between the two places.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t see much of one another,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, not improving in\r\nrespect of ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 With a rather sad shake of her head. \xe2\x80\x98Charley always does well, Mr\r\nHeadstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He could not do better. I regard his course as quite plain before him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hoped so. I am so thankful. So well done of you, Charley dear! It is\r\nbetter for me not to come (except when he wants me) between him and his\r\nprospects. You think so, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nConscious that his pupil-teacher was looking for his answer, that he\r\nhimself had suggested the boy\xe2\x80\x99s keeping aloof from this sister, now seen\r\nfor the first time face to face, Bradley Headstone stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your brother is very much occupied, you know. He has to work hard. One\r\ncannot but say that the less his attention is diverted from his work,\r\nthe better for his future. When he shall have established himself, why\r\nthen--it will be another thing then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie shook her head again, and returned, with a quiet smile: \xe2\x80\x98I always\r\nadvised him as you advise him. Did I not, Charley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, never mind that now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy. \xe2\x80\x98How are you getting on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, Charley. I want for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have your own room here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes. Upstairs. And it\xe2\x80\x99s quiet, and pleasant, and airy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she always has the use of this room for visitors,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nperson of the house, screwing up one of her little bony fists, like an\r\nopera-glass, and looking through it, with her eyes and her chin in that\r\nquaint accordance. \xe2\x80\x98Always this room for visitors; haven\xe2\x80\x99t you, Lizzie\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt happened that Bradley Headstone noticed a very slight action of\r\nLizzie Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s hand, as though it checked the doll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker. And it\r\nhappened that the latter noticed him in the same instant; for she made\r\na double eyeglass of her two hands, looked at him through it, and cried,\r\nwith a waggish shake of her head: \xe2\x80\x98Aha! Caught you spying, did I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt might have fallen out so, any way; but Bradley Headstone also noticed\r\nthat immediately after this, Lizzie, who had not taken off her bonnet,\r\nrather hurriedly proposed that as the room was getting dark they should\r\ngo out into the air. They went out; the visitors saying good-night to\r\nthe doll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker, whom they left, leaning back in her chair with\r\nher arms crossed, singing to herself in a sweet thoughtful little voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll saunter on by the river,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley. \xe2\x80\x98You will be glad to talk\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs his uneasy figure went on before them among the evening shadows, the\r\nboy said to his sister, petulantly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When are you going to settle yourself in some Christian sort of place,\r\nLiz? I thought you were going to do it before now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very well where I am, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well where you are! I am ashamed to have brought Mr Headstone with\r\nme. How came you to get into such company as that little witch\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By chance at first, as it seemed, Charley. But I think it must have\r\nbeen by something more than chance, for that child--You remember the\r\nbills upon the walls at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confound the bills upon the walls at home! I want to forget the bills\r\nupon the walls at home, and it would be better for you to do the same,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngrumbled the boy. \xe2\x80\x98Well; what of them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This child is the grandchild of the old man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What old man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The terrible drunken old man, in the list slippers and the night-cap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy asked, rubbing his nose in a manner that half expressed vexation\r\nat hearing so much, and half curiosity to hear more: \xe2\x80\x98How came you to\r\nmake that out? What a girl you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The child\xe2\x80\x99s father is employed by the house that employs me; that\xe2\x80\x99s how\r\nI came to know it, Charley. The father is like his own father, a weak\r\nwretched trembling creature, falling to pieces, never sober. But a good\r\nworkman too, at the work he does. The mother is dead. This poor ailing\r\nlittle creature has come to be what she is, surrounded by drunken people\r\nfrom her cradle--if she ever had one, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what you have to do with her, for all that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Charley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy looked doggedly at the river. They were at Millbank, and\r\nthe river rolled on their left. His sister gently touched him on the\r\nshoulder, and pointed to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any compensation--restitution--never mind the word, you know my\r\nmeaning. Father\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he did not respond with any tenderness. After a moody silence he\r\nbroke out in an ill-used tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll be a very hard thing, Liz, if, when I am trying my best to get up\r\nin the world, you pull me back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, Charley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you, Liz. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you let bygones be bygones? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you, as\r\nMr Headstone said to me this very evening about another matter, leave\r\nwell alone? What we have got to do, is, to turn our faces full in our\r\nnew direction, and keep straight on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And never look back? Not even to try to make some amends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are such a dreamer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, with his former petulance. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwas all very well when we sat before the fire--when we looked into the\r\nhollow down by the flare--but we are looking into the real world, now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, we were looking into the real world then, Charley!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand what you mean by that, but you are not justified in it. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want, as I raise myself to shake you off, Liz. I want to carry you\r\nup with me. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to do, and mean to do. I know what I owe\r\nyou. I said to Mr Headstone this very evening, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, my sister got\r\nme here.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, then. Don\xe2\x80\x99t pull me back, and hold me down. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I\r\nask, and surely that\xe2\x80\x99s not unconscionable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had kept a steadfast look upon him, and she answered with composure:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not here selfishly, Charley. To please myself I could not be too\r\nfar from that river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor could you be too far from it to please me. Let us get quit of it\r\nequally. Why should you linger about it any more than I? I give it a\r\nwide berth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t get away from it, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, passing her hand\r\nacross her forehead. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s no purpose of mine that I live by it still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There you go, Liz! Dreaming again! You lodge yourself of your own\r\naccord in a house with a drunken--tailor, I suppose--or something of the\r\nsort, and a little crooked antic of a child, or old person, or whatever\r\nit is, and then you talk as if you were drawn or driven there. Now, do\r\nbe more practical.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had been practical enough with him, in suffering and striving\r\nfor him; but she only laid her hand upon his shoulder--not\r\nreproachfully--and tapped it twice or thrice. She had been used to\r\ndo so, to soothe him when she carried him about, a child as heavy as\r\nherself. Tears started to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, Liz,\xe2\x80\x99 drawing the back of his hand across them, \xe2\x80\x98I mean\r\nto be a good brother to you, and to prove that I know what I owe you.\r\nAll I say is, that I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll control your fancies a little, on my\r\naccount. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a school, and then you must come and live with me,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to control your fancies then, so why not now? Now, say I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t vexed you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You haven\xe2\x80\x99t, Charley, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And say I haven\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You haven\xe2\x80\x99t, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99 But this answer was less ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say you are sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to. Come! There\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Headstone stopping\r\nand looking over the wall at the tide, to hint that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go.\r\nKiss me, and tell me that you know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to hurt you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe told him so, and they embraced, and walked on and came up with the\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we go your sister\xe2\x80\x99s way,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked, when the boy told him he was\r\nready. And with his cumbrous and uneasy action he stiffly offered her\r\nhis arm. Her hand was just within it, when she drew it back. He looked\r\nround with a start, as if he thought she had detected something that\r\nrepelled her, in the momentary touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not go in just yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x98And you have a distance\r\nbefore you, and will walk faster without me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBeing by this time close to Vauxhall Bridge, they resolved, in\r\nconsequence, to take that way over the Thames, and they left her;\r\nBradley Headstone giving her his hand at parting, and she thanking him\r\nfor his care of her brother.\r\n\r\nThe master and the pupil walked on, rapidly and silently. They had\r\nnearly crossed the bridge, when a gentleman came coolly sauntering\r\ntowards them, with a cigar in his mouth, his coat thrown back, and his\r\nhands behind him. Something in the careless manner of this person,\r\nand in a certain lazily arrogant air with which he approached, holding\r\npossession of twice as much pavement as another would have claimed,\r\ninstantly caught the boy\xe2\x80\x99s attention. As the gentleman passed the boy\r\nlooked at him narrowly, and then stood still, looking after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is it that you stare after?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why!\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, with a confused and pondering frown upon his face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It IS that Wrayburn one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone scrutinized the boy as closely as the boy had\r\nscrutinized the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Mr Headstone, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help wondering what in\r\nthe world brought HIM here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThough he said it as if his wonder were past--at the same time resuming\r\nthe walk--it was not lost upon the master that he looked over his\r\nshoulder after speaking, and that the same perplexed and pondering frown\r\nwas heavy on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to like your friend, Hexam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I DON\xe2\x80\x99T like him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He took hold of me by the chin in a precious impertinent way, the first\r\ntime I ever saw him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again, why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For nothing. Or--it\xe2\x80\x99s much the same--because something I happened to\r\nsay about my sister didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to please him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he knows your sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He didn\xe2\x80\x99t at that time,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, still moodily pondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy had so lost himself that he looked at Mr Bradley Headstone\r\nas they walked on side by side, without attempting to reply until the\r\nquestion had been repeated; then he nodded and answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going to see her, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, quickly. \xe2\x80\x98He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know her well enough.\r\nI should like to catch him at it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked on for a time, more rapidly than before, the master\r\nsaid, clasping the pupil\xe2\x80\x99s arm between the elbow and the shoulder with\r\nhis hand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were going to tell me something about that person. What did you say\r\nhis name was?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wrayburn. Mr Eugene Wrayburn. He is what they call a barrister, with\r\nnothing to do. The first time he came to our old place was when my\r\nfather was alive. He came on business; not that it was HIS business--HE\r\nnever had any business--he was brought by a friend of his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the other times?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was only one other time that I know of. When my father was killed\r\nby accident, he chanced to be one of the finders. He was mooning about,\r\nI suppose, taking liberties with people\xe2\x80\x99s chins; but there he was,\r\nsomehow. He brought the news home to my sister early in the morning, and\r\nbrought Miss Abbey Potterson, a neighbour, to help break it to her.\r\nHe was mooning about the house when I was fetched home in the\r\nafternoon--they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to find me till my sister could be\r\nbrought round sufficiently to tell them--and then he mooned away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And is that all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone gradually released the boy\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as if he were\r\nthoughtful, and they walked on side by side as before. After a long\r\nsilence between them, Bradley resumed the talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose--your sister--\xe2\x80\x99 with a curious break both before and after\r\nthe words, \xe2\x80\x98has received hardly any teaching, Hexam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hardly any, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sacrificed, no doubt, to her father\xe2\x80\x99s objections. I remember them in\r\nyour case. Yet--your sister--scarcely looks or speaks like an ignorant\r\nperson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie has as much thought as the best, Mr Headstone. Too much,\r\nperhaps, without teaching. I used to call the fire at home, her books,\r\nfor she was always full of fancies--sometimes quite wise fancies,\r\nconsidering--when she sat looking at it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone.\r\n\r\nHis pupil was a little surprised by this striking in with so sudden\r\nand decided and emotional an objection, but took it as a proof of the\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s interest in himself. It emboldened him to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never brought myself to mention it openly to you, Mr Headstone,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99re my witness that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even make up my mind to take it\r\nfrom you before we came out to-night; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a painful thing to think\r\nthat if I get on as well as you hope, I shall be--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say disgraced,\r\nbecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean disgraced--but--rather put to the blush if it was\r\nknown--by a sister who has been very good to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone in a slurring way, for his mind scarcely\r\nseemed to touch that point, so smoothly did it glide to another, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nthere is this possibility to consider. Some man who had worked his way\r\nmight come to admire--your sister--and might even in time bring himself\r\nto think of marrying--your sister--and it would be a sad drawback and a\r\nheavy penalty upon him, if; overcoming in his mind other inequalities of\r\ncondition and other considerations against it, this inequality and this\r\nconsideration remained in full force.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s much my own meaning, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone, \xe2\x80\x98but you spoke of a mere brother.\r\nNow, the case I have supposed would be a much stronger case; because an\r\nadmirer, a husband, would form the connexion voluntarily, besides being\r\nobliged to proclaim it: which a brother is not. After all, you know, it\r\nmust be said of you that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help yourself: while it would be\r\nsaid of him, with equal reason, that he could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s true, sir. Sometimes since Lizzie was left free by father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, I have thought that such a young woman might soon acquire more\r\nthan enough to pass muster. And sometimes I have even thought that\r\nperhaps Miss Peecher--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the purpose, I would advise Not Miss Peecher,\xe2\x80\x99 Bradley Headstone\r\nstruck in with a recurrence of his late decision of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you be so kind as to think of it for me, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Hexam, yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll think maturely of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthink well of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir walk was almost a silent one afterwards, until it ended at the\r\nschool-house. There, one of neat Miss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s little windows, like the\r\neyes in needles, was illuminated, and in a corner near it sat Mary Anne\r\nwatching, while Miss Peecher at the table stitched at the neat little\r\nbody she was making up by brown paper pattern for her own wearing. N.B.\r\nMiss Peecher and Miss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s pupils were not much encouraged in the\r\nunscholastic art of needlework, by Government.\r\n\r\nMary Anne with her face to the window, held her arm up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone coming home, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn about a minute, Mary Anne again hailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone in and locked his door, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Peecher repressed a sigh as she gathered her work together for bed,\r\nand transfixed that part of her dress where her heart would have been if\r\nshe had had the dress on, with a sharp, sharp needle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nSTILL EDUCATIONAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person of the house, doll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker and manufacturer of\r\nornamental pincushions and pen-wipers, sat in her quaint little low\r\narm-chair, singing in the dark, until Lizzie came back. The person\r\nof the house had attained that dignity while yet of very tender years\r\nindeed, through being the only trustworthy person IN the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well Lizzie-Mizzie-Wizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, breaking off in her song, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe news out of doors?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the news in doors?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie, playfully smoothing the\r\nbright long fair hair which grew very luxuriant and beautiful on the\r\nhead of the doll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see, said the blind man. Why the last news is, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto marry your brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No-o,\xe2\x80\x99 shaking her head and her chin. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t like the boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say to his master?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say that I think he\xe2\x80\x99s bespoke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie finished putting the hair carefully back over the misshapen\r\nshoulders, and then lighted a candle. It showed the little parlour to\r\nbe dingy, but orderly and clean. She stood it on the mantelshelf, remote\r\nfrom the dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and then put the room door open, and the\r\nhouse door open, and turned the little low chair and its occupant\r\ntowards the outer air. It was a sultry night, and this was a\r\nfine-weather arrangement when the day\xe2\x80\x99s work was done. To complete\r\nit, she seated herself in a chair by the side of the little chair, and\r\nprotectingly drew under her arm the spare hand that crept up to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is what your loving Jenny Wren calls the best time in the day and\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house. Her real name was Fanny Cleaver;\r\nbut she had long ago chosen to bestow upon herself the appellation of\r\nMiss Jenny Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 Jenny went on, \xe2\x80\x98as I sat at work to-day, what\r\na thing it would be, if I should be able to have your company till I am\r\nmarried, or at least courted. Because when I am courted, I shall make\r\nHim do some of the things that you do for me. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t brush my hair\r\nlike you do, or help me up and down stairs like you do, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo anything like you do; but he could take my work home, and he could\r\ncall for orders in his clumsy way. And he shall too. I\xe2\x80\x99LL trot him\r\nabout, I can tell him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJenny Wren had her personal vanities--happily for her--and no intentions\r\nwere stronger in her breast than the various trials and torments that\r\nwere, in the fulness of time, to be inflicted upon \xe2\x80\x98him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wherever he may happen to be just at present, or whoever he may happen\r\nto be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98I know his tricks and his manners, and I give\r\nhim warning to look out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you are rather hard upon him?\xe2\x80\x99 asked her friend,\r\nsmiling, and smoothing her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the sage Miss Wren, with an air of vast experience.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care for you, those fellows, if you\xe2\x80\x99re NOT hard\r\nupon \xe2\x80\x98em. But I was saying If I should be able to have your company. Ah!\r\nWhat a large If! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no intention of parting company, Jenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll go directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I so little to be relied upon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re more to be relied upon than silver and gold.\xe2\x80\x99 As she said it,\r\nMiss Wren suddenly broke off, screwed up her eyes and her chin, and\r\nlooked prodigiously knowing. \xe2\x80\x98Aha!\r\n\r\n     Who comes here?\r\n     A Grenadier.\r\n     What does he want?\r\n     A pot of beer.\r\n\r\nAnd nothing else in the world, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA man\xe2\x80\x99s figure paused on the pavement at the outer door. \xe2\x80\x98Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I am told,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may come in, if you\xe2\x80\x99re good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99ll come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gave his hand to Jenny Wren, and he gave his hand to Lizzie, and he\r\nstood leaning by the door at Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s side. He had been strolling with\r\nhis cigar, he said, (it was smoked out and gone by this time,) and he\r\nhad strolled round to return in that direction that he might look in as\r\nhe passed. Had she not seen her brother to-night?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, whose manner was a little troubled.\r\n\r\nGracious condescension on our brother\xe2\x80\x99s part! Mr Eugene Wrayburn thought\r\nhe had passed my young gentleman on the bridge yonder. Who was his\r\nfriend with him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure. Looked like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie sat so still, that one could not have said wherein the fact of\r\nher manner being troubled was expressed; and yet one could not have\r\ndoubted it. Eugene was as easy as ever; but perhaps, as she sat with\r\nher eyes cast down, it might have been rather more perceptible that\r\nhis attention was concentrated upon her for certain moments, than its\r\nconcentration upon any subject for any short time ever was, elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have nothing to report, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98But, having promised\r\nyou that an eye should be always kept on Mr Riderhood through my friend\r\nLightwood, I like occasionally to renew my assurance that I keep my\r\npromise, and keep my friend up to the mark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not have doubted it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Generally, I confess myself a man to be doubted,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene,\r\ncoolly, \xe2\x80\x98for all that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the sharp Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the airy Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I am a bad idle dog.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you reform and be a good dog?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody who makes it worth\r\nmy while. Have you considered my suggestion, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99 This in a lower\r\nvoice, but only as if it were a graver matter; not at all to the\r\nexclusion of the person of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have thought of it, Mr Wrayburn, but I have not been able to make up\r\nmy mind to accept it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98False pride!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think not, Mr Wrayburn. I hope not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98False pride!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98Why, what else is it? The thing is\r\nworth nothing in itself. The thing is worth nothing to me. What can it\r\nbe worth to me? You know the most I make of it. I propose to be of some\r\nuse to somebody--which I never was in this world, and never shall be on\r\nany other occasion--by paying some qualified person of your own sex and\r\nage, so many (or rather so few) contemptible shillings, to come here,\r\ncertain nights in the week, and give you certain instruction which you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been a self-denying daughter and sister.\r\nYou know that it\xe2\x80\x99s good to have it, or you would never have so devoted\r\nyourself to your brother\xe2\x80\x99s having it. Then why not have it: especially\r\nwhen our friend Miss Jenny here would profit by it too? If I proposed to\r\nbe the teacher, or to attend the lessons--obviously incongruous!--but\r\nas to that, I might as well be on the other side of the globe, or not\r\non the globe at all. False pride, Lizzie. Because true pride wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshame, or be shamed by, your thankless brother. True pride wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nschoolmasters brought here, like doctors, to look at a bad case. True\r\npride would go to work and do it. You know that, well enough, for you\r\nknow that your own true pride would do it to-morrow, if you had the ways\r\nand means which false pride won\xe2\x80\x99t let me supply. Very well. I add no\r\nmore than this. Your false pride does wrong to yourself and does wrong\r\nto your dead father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How to my father, Mr Wrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, with an anxious face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How to your father? Can you ask! By perpetuating the consequences of\r\nhis ignorant and blind obstinacy. By resolving not to set right the\r\nwrong he did you. By determining that the deprivation to which he\r\ncondemned you, and which he forced upon you, shall always rest upon his\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt chanced to be a subtle string to sound, in her who had so spoken to\r\nher brother within the hour. It sounded far more forcibly, because of\r\nthe change in the speaker for the moment; the passing appearance of\r\nearnestness, complete conviction, injured resentment of suspicion,\r\ngenerous and unselfish interest. All these qualities, in him usually so\r\nlight and careless, she felt to be inseparable from some touch of their\r\nopposites in her own breast. She thought, had she, so far below him\r\nand so different, rejected this disinterestedness, because of some vain\r\nmisgiving that he sought her out, or heeded any personal attractions\r\nthat he might descry in her? The poor girl, pure of heart and purpose,\r\ncould not bear to think it. Sinking before her own eyes, as she\r\nsuspected herself of it, she drooped her head as though she had done him\r\nsome wicked and grievous injury, and broke into silent tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be distressed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, very, very kindly. \xe2\x80\x98I hope it is not\r\nI who have distressed you. I meant no more than to put the matter in its\r\ntrue light before you; though I acknowledge I did it selfishly enough,\r\nfor I am disappointed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDisappointed of doing her a service. How else COULD he be disappointed?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t break my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t stay by me\r\neight-and-forty hours; but I am genuinely disappointed. I had set my\r\nfancy on doing this little thing for you and for our friend Miss Jenny.\r\nThe novelty of my doing anything in the least useful, had its charms. I\r\nsee, now, that I might have managed it better. I might have affected to\r\ndo it wholly for our friend Miss J. I might have got myself up, morally,\r\nas Sir Eugene Bountiful. But upon my soul I can\xe2\x80\x99t make flourishes, and I\r\nwould rather be disappointed than try.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf he meant to follow home what was in Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, it was\r\nskilfully done. If he followed it by mere fortuitous coincidence, it was\r\ndone by an evil chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It opened out so naturally before me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98The ball seemed so\r\nthrown into my hands by accident! I happen to be originally brought into\r\ncontact with you, Lizzie, on those two occasions that you know of. I\r\nhappen to be able to promise you that a watch shall be kept upon that\r\nfalse accuser, Riderhood. I happen to be able to give you some little\r\nconsolation in the darkest hour of your distress, by assuring you that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe him. On the same occasion I tell you that I am the idlest\r\nand least of lawyers, but that I am better than none, in a case I have\r\nnoted down with my own hand, and that you may be always sure of my best\r\nhelp, and incidentally of Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s too, in your efforts to clear\r\nyour father. So, it gradually takes my fancy that I may help you--so\r\neasily!--to clear your father of that other blame which I mentioned\r\na few minutes ago, and which is a just and real one. I hope I have\r\nexplained myself; for I am heartily sorry to have distressed you. I hate\r\nto claim to mean well, but I really did mean honestly and simply well,\r\nand I want you to know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never doubted that, Mr Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie; the more\r\nrepentant, the less he claimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad to hear it. Though if you had quite understood my whole\r\nmeaning at first, I think you would not have refused. Do you think you\r\nwould?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I should, Mr Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! Then why refuse now you do understand it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for me to talk to you,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie, in some\r\nconfusion, \xe2\x80\x98for you see all the consequences of what I say, as soon as I\r\nsay it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take all the consequences,\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98and take away my\r\ndisappointment. Lizzie Hexam, as I truly respect you, and as I am your\r\nfriend and a poor devil of a gentleman, I protest I don\xe2\x80\x99t even now\r\nunderstand why you hesitate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an appearance of openness, trustfulness, unsuspecting\r\ngenerosity, in his words and manner, that won the poor girl over; and\r\nnot only won her over, but again caused her to feel as though she had\r\nbeen influenced by the opposite qualities, with vanity at their head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not hesitate any longer, Mr Wrayburn. I hope you will not\r\nthink the worse of me for having hesitated at all. For myself and for\r\nJenny--you let me answer for you, Jenny dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little creature had been leaning back, attentive, with her elbows\r\nresting on the elbows of her chair, and her chin upon her hands. Without\r\nchanging her attitude, she answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 so suddenly that it rather\r\nseemed as if she had chopped the monosyllable than spoken it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For myself and for Jenny, I thankfully accept your kind offer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Agreed! Dismissed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, giving Lizzie his hand before lightly\r\nwaving it, as if he waved the whole subject away. \xe2\x80\x98I hope it may not be\r\noften that so much is made of so little!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he fell to talking playfully with Jenny Wren. \xe2\x80\x98I think of setting\r\nup a doll, Miss Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure to break it. All you children do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that makes good for trade, you know, Miss Wren,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much as people\xe2\x80\x99s breaking promises and contracts and bargains of all\r\nsorts, makes good for MY trade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Wren retorted; \xe2\x80\x98but you had better by\r\nhalf set up a pen-wiper, and turn industrious, and use it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, if we were all as industrious as you, little Busy-Body, we should\r\nbegin to work as soon as we could crawl, and there would be a bad\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the little creature, with a flush suffusing her\r\nface, \xe2\x80\x98bad for your backs and your legs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; shocked--to do him justice--at the thought of\r\ntrifling with her infirmity. \xe2\x80\x98Bad for business, bad for business. If we\r\nall set to work as soon as we could use our hands, it would be all over\r\nwith the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmakers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s something in that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren; \xe2\x80\x98you have a sort of an\r\nidea in your noddle sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, in a changed tone; \xe2\x80\x98Talking of\r\nideas, my Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 they were sitting side by side as they had sat at\r\nfirst, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder how it happens that when I am work, work, working here,\r\nall alone in the summer-time, I smell flowers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a commonplace individual, I should say,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene suggested\r\nlanguidly--for he was growing weary of the person of the house--\xe2\x80\x98that\r\nyou smell flowers because you DO smell flowers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little creature, resting one arm upon the elbow\r\nof her chair, resting her chin upon that hand, and looking vacantly\r\nbefore her; \xe2\x80\x98this is not a flowery neighbourhood. It\xe2\x80\x99s anything but\r\nthat. And yet as I sit at work, I smell miles of flowers. I smell roses,\r\ntill I think I see the rose-leaves lying in heaps, bushels, on the\r\nfloor. I smell fallen leaves, till I put down my hand--so--and expect to\r\nmake them rustle. I smell the white and the pink May in the hedges, and\r\nall sorts of flowers that I never was among. For I have seen very few\r\nflowers indeed, in my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pleasant fancies to have, Jenny dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said her friend: with a glance\r\ntowards Eugene as if she would have asked him whether they were given\r\nthe child in compensation for her losses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I think, Lizzie, when they come to me. And the birds I hear! Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried the little creature, holding out her hand and looking upward, \xe2\x80\x98how\r\nthey sing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something in the face and action for the moment, quite\r\ninspired and beautiful. Then the chin dropped musingly upon the hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say my birds sing better than other birds, and my flowers smell\r\nbetter than other flowers. For when I was a little child,\xe2\x80\x99 in a tone as\r\nthough it were ages ago, \xe2\x80\x98the children that I used to see early in the\r\nmorning were very different from any others that I ever saw. They were\r\nnot like me; they were not chilled, anxious, ragged, or beaten; they\r\nwere never in pain. They were not like the children of the neighbours;\r\nthey never made me tremble all over, by setting up shrill noises, and\r\nthey never mocked me. Such numbers of them too! All in white dresses,\r\nand with something shining on the borders, and on their heads, that I\r\nhave never been able to imitate with my work, though I know it so\r\nwell. They used to come down in long bright slanting rows, and say all\r\ntogether, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this in pain! Who is this in pain!\xe2\x80\x9d When I told them\r\nwho it was, they answered, \xe2\x80\x9cCome and play with us!\xe2\x80\x9d When I said \xe2\x80\x9cI never\r\nplay! I can\xe2\x80\x99t play!\xe2\x80\x9d they swept about me and took me up, and made me\r\nlight. Then it was all delicious ease and rest till they laid me\r\ndown, and said, all together, \xe2\x80\x9cHave patience, and we will come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Whenever they came back, I used to know they were coming before I saw\r\nthe long bright rows, by hearing them ask, all together a long way off,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this in pain! Who is this in pain!\xe2\x80\x9d And I used to cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cO my\r\nblessed children, it\xe2\x80\x99s poor me. Have pity on me. Take me up and make me\r\nlight!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy degrees, as she progressed in this remembrance, the hand was raised,\r\nthe late ecstatic look returned, and she became quite beautiful. Having\r\nso paused for a moment, silent, with a listening smile upon her face,\r\nshe looked round and recalled herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What poor fun you think me; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mr Wrayburn? You may well look\r\ntired of me. But it\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday night, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is to say, Miss Wren,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Eugene, quite ready to profit by\r\nthe hint, \xe2\x80\x98you wish me to go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday night,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, \xe2\x80\x98and my child\xe2\x80\x99s coming\r\nhome. And my child is a troublesome bad child, and costs me a world of\r\nscolding. I would rather you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see my child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A doll?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, not understanding, and looking for an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nBut Lizzie, with her lips only, shaping the two words, \xe2\x80\x98Her father,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ndelayed no longer. He took his leave immediately. At the corner of the\r\nstreet he stopped to light another cigar, and possibly to ask himself\r\nwhat he was doing otherwise. If so, the answer was indefinite and vague.\r\nWho knows what he is doing, who is careless what he does!\r\n\r\nA man stumbled against him as he turned away, who mumbled some maudlin\r\napology. Looking after this man, Eugene saw him go in at the door by\r\nwhich he himself had just come out.\r\n\r\nOn the man\xe2\x80\x99s stumbling into the room, Lizzie rose to leave it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go away, Miss Hexam,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a submissive manner, speaking\r\nthickly and with difficulty. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t fly from unfortunate man in\r\nshattered state of health. Give poor invalid honour of your company. It\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t--ain\xe2\x80\x99t catching.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie murmured that she had something to do in her own room, and went\r\naway upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How\xe2\x80\x99s my Jenny?\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, timidly. \xe2\x80\x98How\xe2\x80\x99s my Jenny Wren, best of\r\nchildren, object dearest affections broken-hearted invalid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which the person of the house, stretching out her arm in an attitude\r\nof command, replied with irresponsive asperity: \xe2\x80\x98Go along with you! Go\r\nalong into your corner! Get into your corner directly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wretched spectacle made as if he would have offered some\r\nremonstrance; but not venturing to resist the person of the house,\r\nthought better of it, and went and sat down on a particular chair of\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh-h-h!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the person of the house, pointing her little finger,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You bad old boy! Oh-h-h you naughty, wicked creature! WHAT do you mean\r\nby it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe shaking figure, unnerved and disjointed from head to foot, put\r\nout its two hands a little way, as making overtures of peace and\r\nreconciliation. Abject tears stood in its eyes, and stained the blotched\r\nred of its cheeks. The swollen lead-coloured under lip trembled with a\r\nshameful whine. The whole indecorous threadbare ruin, from the broken\r\nshoes to the prematurely-grey scanty hair, grovelled. Not with any sense\r\nworthy to be called a sense, of this dire reversal of the places of\r\nparent and child, but in a pitiful expostulation to be let off from a\r\nscolding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know your tricks and your manners,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98I know where\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been to!\xe2\x80\x99 (which indeed it did not require discernment to\r\ndiscover). \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you disgraceful old chap!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe very breathing of the figure was contemptible, as it laboured and\r\nrattled in that operation, like a blundering clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slave, slave, slave, from morning to night,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the person of the\r\nhouse, \xe2\x80\x98and all for this! WHAT do you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something in that emphasized \xe2\x80\x98What,\xe2\x80\x99 which absurdly frightened\r\nthe figure. As often as the person of the house worked her way round to\r\nit--even as soon as he saw that it was coming--he collapsed in an extra\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you had been taken up, and locked up,\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the\r\nhouse. \xe2\x80\x98I wish you had been poked into cells and black holes, and run\r\nover by rats and spiders and beetles. I know their tricks and their\r\nmanners, and they\xe2\x80\x99d have tickled you nicely. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 stammered the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house, terrifying him by a grand muster\r\nof her spirits and forces before recurring to the emphatic word, \xe2\x80\x98WHAT\r\ndo you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Circumstances over which had no control,\xe2\x80\x99 was the miserable creature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplea in extenuation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99LL circumstance you and control you too,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted the person of the\r\nhouse, speaking with vehement sharpness, \xe2\x80\x98if you talk in that way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive you in charge to the police, and have you fined five shillings when\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t pay, and then I won\xe2\x80\x99t pay the money for you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ntransported for life. How should you like to be transported for life?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Poor shattered invalid. Trouble nobody long,\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nthe wretched figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come!\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of the house, tapping the table near her\r\nin a business-like manner, and shaking her head and her chin; \xe2\x80\x98you know\r\nwhat you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do. Put down your money this instant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe obedient figure began to rummage in its pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Spent a fortune out of your wages, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound!\xe2\x80\x99 said the person of\r\nthe house. \xe2\x80\x98Put it here! All you\xe2\x80\x99ve got left! Every farthing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSuch a business as he made of collecting it from his dogs\xe2\x80\x99-eared\r\npockets; of expecting it in this pocket, and not finding it; of not\r\nexpecting it in that pocket, and passing it over; of finding no pocket\r\nwhere that other pocket ought to be!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this all?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded the person of the house, when a confused heap of\r\npence and shillings lay on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Got no more,\xe2\x80\x99 was the rueful answer, with an accordant shake of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me make sure. You know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do. Turn all your pockets\r\ninside out, and leave \xe2\x80\x98em so!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the person of the house.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed. And if anything could have made him look more abject or more\r\ndismally ridiculous than before, it would have been his so displaying\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s but seven and eightpence halfpenny!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren, after\r\nreducing the heap to order. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you prodigal old son! Now you shall be\r\nstarved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t starve me,\xe2\x80\x99 he urged, whimpering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you were treated as you ought to be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99d be fed\r\nupon the skewers of cats\xe2\x80\x99 meat;--only the skewers, after the cats had\r\nhad the meat. As it is, go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he stumbled out of the corner to comply, he again put out both his\r\nhands, and pleaded: \xe2\x80\x98Circumstances over which no control--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get along with you to bed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Wren, snapping him up. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to forgive you. Go to bed this moment!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSeeing another emphatic \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99 upon its way, he evaded it by complying\r\nand was heard to shuffle heavily up stairs, and shut his door, and throw\r\nhimself on his bed. Within a little while afterwards, Lizzie came down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we have our supper, Jenny dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! bless us and save us, we need have something to keep us going,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreturned Miss Jenny, shrugging her shoulders.\r\n\r\nLizzie laid a cloth upon the little bench (more handy for the person of\r\nthe house than an ordinary table), and put upon it such plain fare as\r\nthey were accustomed to have, and drew up a stool for herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now for supper! What are you thinking of, Jenny darling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 she returned, coming out of a deep study, \xe2\x80\x98what I\r\nwould do to Him, if he should turn out a drunkard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that, beforehand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall try to take care of it beforehand, but he might deceive me.\r\nOh, my dear, all those fellows with their tricks and their manners do\r\ndeceive!\xe2\x80\x99 With the little fist in full action. \xe2\x80\x98And if so, I tell you\r\nwhat I think I\xe2\x80\x99d do. When he was asleep, I\xe2\x80\x99d make a spoon red hot, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d have some boiling liquor bubbling in a saucepan, and I\xe2\x80\x99d take it\r\nout hissing, and I\xe2\x80\x99d open his mouth with the other hand--or perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsleep with his mouth ready open--and I\xe2\x80\x99d pour it down his throat, and\r\nblister it and choke him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure you would do no such horrible thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Well; perhaps I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. But I should like to!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am equally sure you would not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not even like to? Well, you generally know best. Only you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nalways lived among it as I have lived--and your back isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad and your\r\nlegs are not queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs they went on with their supper, Lizzie tried to bring her round to\r\nthat prettier and better state. But, the charm was broken. The person\r\nof the house was the person of a house full of sordid shames and cares,\r\nwith an upper room in which that abased figure was infecting even\r\ninnocent sleep with sensual brutality and degradation. The doll\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressmaker had become a little quaint shrew; of the world, worldly; of\r\nthe earth, earthy.\r\n\r\nPoor doll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker! How often so dragged down by hands that should\r\nhave raised her up; how often so misdirected when losing her way on the\r\neternal road, and asking guidance! Poor, poor little doll\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nA PIECE OF WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nBritannia, sitting meditating one fine day (perhaps in the attitude in\r\nwhich she is presented on the copper coinage), discovers all of a sudden\r\nthat she wants Veneering in Parliament. It occurs to her that Veneering\r\nis \xe2\x80\x98a representative man\xe2\x80\x99--which cannot in these times be doubted--and\r\nthat Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s faithful Commons are incomplete without him. So,\r\nBritannia mentions to a legal gentleman of her acquaintance that if\r\nVeneering will \xe2\x80\x98put down\xe2\x80\x99 five thousand pounds, he may write a couple\r\nof initial letters after his name at the extremely cheap rate of two\r\nthousand five hundred per letter. It is clearly understood between\r\nBritannia and the legal gentleman that nobody is to take up the five\r\nthousand pounds, but that being put down they will disappear by magical\r\nconjuration and enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe legal gentleman in Britannia\xe2\x80\x99s confidence going straight from that\r\nlady to Veneering, thus commissioned, Veneering declares himself highly\r\nflattered, but requires breathing time to ascertain \xe2\x80\x98whether his friends\r\nwill rally round him.\xe2\x80\x99 Above all things, he says, it behoves him to be\r\nclear, at a crisis of this importance, \xe2\x80\x98whether his friends will rally\r\nround him.\xe2\x80\x99 The legal gentleman, in the interests of his client cannot\r\nallow much time for this purpose, as the lady rather thinks she knows\r\nsomebody prepared to put down six thousand pounds; but he says he will\r\ngive Veneering four hours.\r\n\r\nVeneering then says to Mrs Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98We must work,\xe2\x80\x99 and throws himself\r\ninto a Hansom cab. Mrs Veneering in the same moment relinquishes baby\r\nto Nurse; presses her aquiline hands upon her brow, to arrange the\r\nthrobbing intellect within; orders out the carriage; and repeats in\r\na distracted and devoted manner, compounded of Ophelia and any\r\nself-immolating female of antiquity you may prefer, \xe2\x80\x98We must work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering having instructed his driver to charge at the Public in the\r\nstreets, like the Life-Guards at Waterloo, is driven furiously to Duke\r\nStreet, Saint James\xe2\x80\x99s. There, he finds Twemlow in his lodgings, fresh\r\nfrom the hands of a secret artist who has been doing something to his\r\nhair with yolks of eggs. The process requiring that Twemlow shall, for\r\ntwo hours after the application, allow his hair to stick upright and dry\r\ngradually, he is in an appropriate state for the receipt of startling\r\nintelligence; looking equally like the Monument on Fish Street Hill, and\r\nKing Priam on a certain incendiary occasion not wholly unknown as a neat\r\npoint from the classics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Twemlow,\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering, grasping both his hands, \xe2\x80\x98as the\r\ndearest and oldest of my friends--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Then there can be no more doubt about it in future,\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Twemlow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and I AM!\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Are you of opinion that your cousin, Lord Snigsworth, would give his\r\nname as a Member of my Committee? I don\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to ask for his\r\nlordship; I only ask for his name. Do you think he would give me his\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn sudden low spirits, Twemlow replies, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My political opinions,\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering, not previously aware of having\r\nany, \xe2\x80\x98are identical with those of Lord Snigsworth, and perhaps as a\r\nmatter of public feeling and public principle, Lord Snigsworth would\r\ngive me his name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It might be so,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow; \xe2\x80\x98but--\xe2\x80\x99 And perplexedly scratching his\r\nhead, forgetful of the yolks of eggs, is the more discomfited by being\r\nreminded how stickey he is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Between such old and intimate friends as ourselves,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues Veneering,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98there should in such a case be no reserve. Promise me that if I ask you\r\nto do anything for me which you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to do, or feel the slightest\r\ndifficulty in doing, you will freely tell me so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis, Twemlow is so kind as to promise, with every appearance of most\r\nheartily intending to keep his word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you have any objection to write down to Snigsworthy Park, and ask\r\nthis favour of Lord Snigsworth? Of course if it were granted I should\r\nknow that I owed it solely to you; while at the same time you would put\r\nit to Lord Snigsworth entirely upon public grounds. Would you have any\r\nobjection?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSays Twemlow, with his hand to his forehead, \xe2\x80\x98You have exacted a promise\r\nfrom me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have, my dear Twemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you expect me to keep it honourably.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, my dear Twemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ON the whole, then;--observe me,\xe2\x80\x99 urges Twemlow with great nicety, as\r\nif; in the case of its having been off the whole, he would have done it\r\ndirectly--\xe2\x80\x98ON the whole, I must beg you to excuse me from addressing any\r\ncommunication to Lord Snigsworth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless you, bless you!\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering; horribly disappointed, but\r\ngrasping him by both hands again, in a particularly fervent manner.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that poor Twemlow should decline to inflict\r\na letter on his noble cousin (who has gout in the temper), inasmuch\r\nas his noble cousin, who allows him a small annuity on which he lives,\r\ntakes it out of him, as the phrase goes, in extreme severity; putting\r\nhim, when he visits at Snigsworthy Park, under a kind of martial law;\r\nordaining that he shall hang his hat on a particular peg, sit on a\r\nparticular chair, talk on particular subjects to particular people, and\r\nperform particular exercises: such as sounding the praises of the Family\r\nVarnish (not to say Pictures), and abstaining from the choicest of the\r\nFamily Wines unless expressly invited to partake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One thing, however, I CAN do for you,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow; \xe2\x80\x98and that is, work\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering blesses him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, in a rising hurry of spirits, \xe2\x80\x98to the\r\nclub;--let us see now; what o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twenty minutes to eleven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll be,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, \xe2\x80\x98at the club by ten minutes to twelve, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever leave it all day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering feels that his friends are rallying round him, and says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, thank you. I knew I could rely upon you. I said to Anastatia\r\nbefore leaving home just now to come to you--of course the first friend\r\nI have seen on a subject so momentous to me, my dear Twemlow--I said to\r\nAnastatia, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must work.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were right, you were right,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Twemlow. \xe2\x80\x98Tell me. Is SHE\r\nworking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is,\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good!\xe2\x80\x99 cries Twemlow, polite little gentleman that he is. \xe2\x80\x98A woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntact is invaluable. To have the dear sex with us, is to have everything\r\nwith us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you have not imparted to me,\xe2\x80\x99 remarks Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98what you think of\r\nmy entering the House of Commons?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoins Twemlow, feelingly, \xe2\x80\x98that it is the best club in\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering again blesses him, plunges down stairs, rushes into his\r\nHansom, and directs the driver to be up and at the British Public, and\r\nto charge into the City.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Twemlow, in an increasing hurry of spirits, gets his hair down\r\nas well as he can--which is not very well; for, after these glutinous\r\napplications it is restive, and has a surface on it somewhat in the\r\nnature of pastry--and gets to the club by the appointed time. At the\r\nclub he promptly secures a large window, writing materials, and all\r\nthe newspapers, and establishes himself; immoveable, to be respectfully\r\ncontemplated by Pall Mall. Sometimes, when a man enters who nods to\r\nhim, Twemlow says, \xe2\x80\x98Do you know Veneering?\xe2\x80\x99 Man says, \xe2\x80\x98No; member of\r\nthe club?\xe2\x80\x99 Twemlow says, \xe2\x80\x98Yes. Coming in for Pocket-Breaches.\xe2\x80\x99 Man says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Hope he may find it worth the money!\xe2\x80\x99 yawns, and saunters out.\r\nTowards six o\xe2\x80\x99clock of the afternoon, Twemlow begins to persuade\r\nhimself that he is positively jaded with work, and thinks it much to be\r\nregretted that he was not brought up as a Parliamentary agent.\r\n\r\nFrom Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s, Veneering dashes at Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s place of business. Finds\r\nPodsnap reading the paper, standing, and inclined to be oratorical\r\nover the astonishing discovery he has made, that Italy is not England.\r\nRespectfully entreats Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for stopping the flow of his\r\nwords of wisdom, and informs him what is in the wind. Tells Podsnap that\r\ntheir political opinions are identical. Gives Podsnap to understand that\r\nhe, Veneering, formed his political opinions while sitting at the feet\r\nof him, Podsnap. Seeks earnestly to know whether Podsnap \xe2\x80\x98will rally\r\nround him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSays Podsnap, something sternly, \xe2\x80\x98Now, first of all, Veneering, do you\r\nask my advice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering falters that as so old and so dear a friend--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s all very well,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap; \xe2\x80\x98but have you made up\r\nyour mind to take this borough of Pocket-Breaches on its own terms, or\r\ndo you ask my opinion whether you shall take it or leave it alone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering repeats that his heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire and his soul\xe2\x80\x99s thirst are,\r\nthat Podsnap shall rally round him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be plain with you, Veneering,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap, knitting his\r\nbrows. \xe2\x80\x98You will infer that I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Parliament, from the fact\r\nof my not being there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhy, of course Veneering knows that! Of course Veneering knows that if\r\nPodsnap chose to go there, he would be there, in a space of time that\r\nmight be stated by the light and thoughtless as a jiffy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not worth my while,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues Podsnap, becoming handsomely\r\nmollified, \xe2\x80\x98and it is the reverse of important to my position. But it\r\nis not my wish to set myself up as law for another man, differently\r\nsituated. You think it IS worth YOUR while, and IS important to YOUR\r\nposition. Is that so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlways with the proviso that Podsnap will rally round him, Veneering\r\nthinks it is so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask my advice,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98Good. Then I won\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nit you. But you do ask my help. Good. Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll work for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering instantly blesses him, and apprises him that Twemlow is\r\nalready working. Podsnap does not quite approve that anybody should\r\nbe already working--regarding it rather in the light of a liberty--but\r\ntolerates Twemlow, and says he is a well-connected old female who will\r\ndo no harm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have nothing very particular to do to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 adds Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmix with some influential people. I had engaged myself to dinner, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll send Mrs Podsnap and get off going myself; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll dine with you\r\nat eight. It\xe2\x80\x99s important we should report progress and compare notes.\r\nNow, let me see. You ought to have a couple of active energetic fellows,\r\nof gentlemanly manners, to go about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering, after cogitation, thinks of Boots and Brewer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whom I have met at your house,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. They\xe2\x80\x99ll do very\r\nwell. Let them each have a cab, and go about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering immediately mentions what a blessing he feels it, to possess\r\na friend capable of such grand administrative suggestions, and really\r\nis elated at this going about of Boots and Brewer, as an idea wearing\r\nan electioneering aspect and looking desperately like business. Leaving\r\nPodsnap, at a hand-gallop, he descends upon Boots and Brewer, who\r\nenthusiastically rally round him by at once bolting off in cabs, taking\r\nopposite directions. Then Veneering repairs to the legal gentleman in\r\nBritannia\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, and with him transacts some delicate affairs\r\nof business, and issues an address to the independent electors of\r\nPocket-Breaches, announcing that he is coming among them for their\r\nsuffrages, as the mariner returns to the home of his early childhood: a\r\nphrase which is none the worse for his never having been near the place\r\nin his life, and not even now distinctly knowing where it is.\r\n\r\nMrs Veneering, during the same eventful hours, is not idle. No sooner\r\ndoes the carriage turn out, all complete, than she turns into it, all\r\ncomplete, and gives the word \xe2\x80\x98To Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99 That charmer dwells\r\nover a staymaker\xe2\x80\x99s in the Belgravian Borders, with a life-size model\r\nin the window on the ground floor of a distinguished beauty in a blue\r\npetticoat, stay-lace in hand, looking over her shoulder at the town in\r\ninnocent surprise. As well she may, to find herself dressing under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nLady Tippins at home? Lady Tippins at home, with the room darkened,\r\nand her back (like the lady\xe2\x80\x99s at the ground-floor window, though for a\r\ndifferent reason) cunningly turned towards the light. Lady Tippins is\r\nso surprised by seeing her dear Mrs Veneering so early--in the middle of\r\nthe night, the pretty creature calls it--that her eyelids almost go up,\r\nunder the influence of that emotion.\r\n\r\nTo whom Mrs Veneering incoherently communicates, how that Veneering\r\nhas been offered Pocket-Breaches; how that it is the time for rallying\r\nround; how that Veneering has said \xe2\x80\x98We must work\xe2\x80\x99; how that she is here,\r\nas a wife and mother, to entreat Lady Tippins to work; how that the\r\ncarriage is at Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s disposal for purposes of work; how that\r\nshe, proprietress of said bran new elegant equipage, will return home on\r\nfoot--on bleeding feet if need be--to work (not specifying how), until\r\nshe drops by the side of baby\xe2\x80\x99s crib.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lady Tippins, \xe2\x80\x98compose yourself; we\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd Lady Tippins really does work, and work the Veneering horses too;\r\nfor she clatters about town all day, calling upon everybody she knows,\r\nand showing her entertaining powers and green fan to immense advantage,\r\nby rattling on with, My dear soul, what do you think? What do\r\nyou suppose me to be? You\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretending to be an\r\nelectioneering agent. And for what place of all places? Pocket-Breaches.\r\nAnd why? Because the dearest friend I have in the world has bought it.\r\nAnd who is the dearest friend I have in the world? A man of the name of\r\nVeneering. Not omitting his wife, who is the other dearest friend I have\r\nin the world; and I positively declare I forgot their baby, who is the\r\nother. And we are carrying on this little farce to keep up appearances,\r\nand isn\xe2\x80\x99t it refreshing! Then, my precious child, the fun of it is that\r\nnobody knows who these Veneerings are, and that they know nobody, and\r\nthat they have a house out of the Tales of the Genii, and give dinners\r\nout of the Arabian Nights. Curious to see \xe2\x80\x98em, my dear? Say you\xe2\x80\x99ll know\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em. Come and dine with \xe2\x80\x98em. They shan\xe2\x80\x99t bore you. Say who shall meet\r\nyou. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make up a party of our own, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage that they shall\r\nnot interfere with you for one single moment. You really ought to see\r\ntheir gold and silver camels. I call their dinner-table, the Caravan.\r\nDo come and dine with my Veneerings, my own Veneerings, my exclusive\r\nproperty, the dearest friends I have in the world! And above all, my\r\ndear, be sure you promise me your vote and interest and all sorts of\r\nplumpers for Pocket-Breaches; for we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of spending sixpence\r\non it, my love, and can only consent to be brought in by the spontaneous\r\nthingummies of the incorruptible whatdoyoucallums.\r\n\r\nNow, the point of view seized by the bewitching Tippins, that this same\r\nworking and rallying round is to keep up appearances, may have something\r\nin it, but not all the truth. More is done, or considered to be\r\ndone--which does as well--by taking cabs, and \xe2\x80\x98going about,\xe2\x80\x99 than the\r\nfair Tippins knew of. Many vast vague reputations have been made,\r\nsolely by taking cabs and going about. This particularly obtains in all\r\nParliamentary affairs. Whether the business in hand be to get a man in,\r\nor get a man out, or get a man over, or promote a railway, or jockey\r\na railway, or what else, nothing is understood to be so effectual as\r\nscouring nowhere in a violent hurry--in short, as taking cabs and going\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nProbably because this reason is in the air, Twemlow, far from being\r\nsingular in his persuasion that he works like a Trojan, is capped by\r\nPodsnap, who in his turn is capped by Boots and Brewer. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nwhen all these hard workers assemble to dine at Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s, it is\r\nunderstood that the cabs of Boots and Brewer mustn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the door, but\r\nthat pails of water must be brought from the nearest baiting-place,\r\nand cast over the horses\xe2\x80\x99 legs on the very spot, lest Boots and Brewer\r\nshould have instant occasion to mount and away. Those fleet messengers\r\nrequire the Analytical to see that their hats are deposited where they\r\ncan be laid hold of at an instant\xe2\x80\x99s notice; and they dine (remarkably\r\nwell though) with the air of firemen in charge of an engine, expecting\r\nintelligence of some tremendous conflagration.\r\n\r\nMrs Veneering faintly remarks, as dinner opens, that many such days\r\nwould be too much for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many such days would be too much for all of us,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lady Tippins, sportively waving her green\r\nfan. \xe2\x80\x98Veneering for ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in!\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in!\xe2\x80\x99 say Boots and Brewer.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, it would be hard to show cause why they should not\r\nbring him in, Pocket-Breaches having closed its little bargain, and\r\nthere being no opposition. However, it is agreed that they must \xe2\x80\x98work\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto the last, and that if they did not work, something indefinite would\r\nhappen. It is likewise agreed that they are all so exhausted with the\r\nwork behind them, and need to be so fortified for the work before them,\r\nas to require peculiar strengthening from Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s cellar. Therefore,\r\nthe Analytical has orders to produce the cream of the cream of his\r\nbinns, and therefore it falls out that rallying becomes rather a trying\r\nword for the occasion; Lady Tippins being observed gamely to inculcate\r\nthe necessity of rearing round their dear Veneering; Podsnap advocating\r\nroaring round him; Boots and Brewer declaring their intention of reeling\r\nround him; and Veneering thanking his devoted friends one and all, with\r\ngreat emotion, for rarullarulling round him.\r\n\r\nIn these inspiring moments, Brewer strikes out an idea which is the\r\ngreat hit of the day. He consults his watch, and says (like Guy Fawkes),\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll now go down to the House of Commons and see how things look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep about the lobby for an hour or so,\xe2\x80\x99 says Brewer, with a\r\ndeeply mysterious countenance, \xe2\x80\x98and if things look well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nback, but will order my cab for nine in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do better,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap.\r\n\r\nVeneering expresses his inability ever to acknowledge this last service.\r\nTears stand in Mrs Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate eyes. Boots shows envy,\r\nloses ground, and is regarded as possessing a second-rate mind. They all\r\ncrowd to the door, to see Brewer off. Brewer says to his driver, \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nis your horse pretty fresh?\xe2\x80\x99 eyeing the animal with critical scrutiny.\r\nDriver says he\xe2\x80\x99s as fresh as butter. \xe2\x80\x98Put him along then,\xe2\x80\x99 says Brewer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98House of Commons.\xe2\x80\x99 Driver darts up, Brewer leaps in, they cheer him as\r\nhe departs, and Mr Podsnap says, \xe2\x80\x98Mark my words, sir. That\xe2\x80\x99s a man of\r\nresource; that\xe2\x80\x99s a man to make his way in life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes for Veneering to deliver a neat and appropriate\r\nstammer to the men of Pocket-Breaches, only Podsnap and Twemlow\r\naccompany him by railway to that sequestered spot. The legal gentleman\r\nis at the Pocket-Breaches Branch Station, with an open carriage with a\r\nprinted bill \xe2\x80\x98Veneering for ever\xe2\x80\x99 stuck upon it, as if it were a wall;\r\nand they gloriously proceed, amidst the grins of the populace, to a\r\nfeeble little town hall on crutches, with some onions and bootlaces\r\nunder it, which the legal gentleman says are a Market; and from the\r\nfront window of that edifice Veneering speaks to the listening earth.\r\nIn the moment of his taking his hat off, Podsnap, as per agreement made\r\nwith Mrs Veneering, telegraphs to that wife and mother, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering loses his way in the usual No Thoroughfares of speech, and\r\nPodsnap and Twemlow say Hear hear! and sometimes, when he can\xe2\x80\x99t by any\r\nmeans back himself out of some very unlucky No Thoroughfare, \xe2\x80\x98He-a-a-r\r\nHe-a-a-r!\xe2\x80\x99 with an air of facetious conviction, as if the ingenuity of\r\nthe thing gave them a sensation of exquisite pleasure. But Veneering\r\nmakes two remarkably good points; so good, that they are supposed\r\nto have been suggested to him by the legal gentleman in Britannia\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence, while briefly conferring on the stairs.\r\n\r\nPoint the first is this. Veneering institutes an original comparison\r\nbetween the country, and a ship; pointedly calling the ship, the Vessel\r\nof the State, and the Minister the Man at the Helm. Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s object\r\nis to let Pocket-Breaches know that his friend on his right (Podsnap) is\r\na man of wealth. Consequently says he, \xe2\x80\x98And, gentlemen, when the timbers\r\nof the Vessel of the State are unsound and the Man at the Helm is\r\nunskilful, would those great Marine Insurers, who rank among our\r\nworld-famed merchant-princes--would they insure her, gentlemen? Would\r\nthey underwrite her? Would they incur a risk in her? Would they have\r\nconfidence in her? Why, gentlemen, if I appealed to my honourable friend\r\nupon my right, himself among the greatest and most respected of that\r\ngreat and much respected class, he would answer No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoint the second is this. The telling fact that Twemlow is related to\r\nLord Snigsworth, must be let off. Veneering supposes a state of public\r\naffairs that probably never could by any possibility exist (though this\r\nis not quite certain, in consequence of his picture being unintelligible\r\nto himself and everybody else), and thus proceeds. \xe2\x80\x98Why, gentlemen, if\r\nI were to indicate such a programme to any class of society, I say it\r\nwould be received with derision, would be pointed at by the finger of\r\nscorn. If I indicated such a programme to any worthy and intelligent\r\ntradesman of your town--nay, I will here be personal, and say Our\r\ntown--what would he reply? He would reply, \xe2\x80\x9cAway with it!\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nHE would reply, gentlemen. In his honest indignation he would reply,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with it!\xe2\x80\x9d But suppose I mounted higher in the social scale.\r\nSuppose I drew my arm through the arm of my respected friend upon my\r\nleft, and, walking with him through the ancestral woods of his family,\r\nand under the spreading beeches of Snigsworthy Park, approached the\r\nnoble hall, crossed the courtyard, entered by the door, went up the\r\nstaircase, and, passing from room to room, found myself at last in\r\nthe august presence of my friend\xe2\x80\x99s near kinsman, Lord Snigsworth. And\r\nsuppose I said to that venerable earl, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, I am here before your\r\nlordship, presented by your lordship\xe2\x80\x99s near kinsman, my friend upon my\r\nleft, to indicate that programme;\xe2\x80\x9d what would his lordship answer? Why,\r\nhe would answer, \xe2\x80\x9cAway with it!\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s what he would answer, gentlemen.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with it!\xe2\x80\x9d Unconsciously using, in his exalted sphere, the exact\r\nlanguage of the worthy and intelligent tradesman of our town, the near\r\nand dear kinsman of my friend upon my left would answer in his wrath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering finishes with this last success, and Mr Podsnap telegraphs to\r\nMrs Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen, dinner is had at the Hotel with the legal gentleman, and then\r\nthere are in due succession, nomination, and declaration. Finally Mr\r\nPodsnap telegraphs to Mrs Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98We have brought him in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother gorgeous dinner awaits them on their return to the Veneering\r\nhalls, and Lady Tippins awaits them, and Boots and Brewer await\r\nthem. There is a modest assertion on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s part that everybody\r\nsingle-handed \xe2\x80\x98brought him in\xe2\x80\x99; but in the main it is conceded by all,\r\nthat that stroke of business on Brewer\xe2\x80\x99s part, in going down to the\r\nhouse that night to see how things looked, was the master-stroke.\r\n\r\nA touching little incident is related by Mrs Veneering, in the course of\r\nthe evening. Mrs Veneering is habitually disposed to be tearful, and\r\nhas an extra disposition that way after her late excitement. Previous\r\nto withdrawing from the dinner-table with Lady Tippins, she says, in a\r\npathetic and physically weak manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will all think it foolish of me, I know, but I must mention it. As\r\nI sat by Baby\xe2\x80\x99s crib, on the night before the election, Baby was very\r\nuneasy in her sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Analytical chemist, who is gloomily looking on, has diabolical\r\nimpulses to suggest \xe2\x80\x98Wind\xe2\x80\x99 and throw up his situation; but represses\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After an interval almost convulsive, Baby curled her little hands in\r\none another and smiled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Veneering stopping here, Mr Podsnap deems it incumbent on him to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98I wonder why!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could it be, I asked myself,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Veneering, looking about her for\r\nher pocket-handkerchief, \xe2\x80\x98that the Fairies were telling Baby that her\r\npapa would shortly be an M. P.?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo overcome by the sentiment is Mrs Veneering, that they all get up\r\nto make a clear stage for Veneering, who goes round the table to the\r\nrescue, and bears her out backward, with her feet impressively scraping\r\nthe carpet: after remarking that her work has been too much for her\r\nstrength. Whether the fairies made any mention of the five thousand\r\npounds, and it disagreed with Baby, is not speculated upon.\r\n\r\nPoor little Twemlow, quite done up, is touched, and still continues\r\ntouched after he is safely housed over the livery-stable yard in\r\nDuke Street, Saint James\xe2\x80\x99s. But there, upon his sofa, a tremendous\r\nconsideration breaks in upon the mild gentleman, putting all softer\r\nconsiderations to the rout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious heavens! Now I have time to think of it, he never saw one of\r\nhis constituents in all his days, until we saw them together!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter having paced the room in distress of mind, with his hand to his\r\nforehead, the innocent Twemlow returns to his sofa and moans:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall either go distracted, or die, of this man. He comes upon me too\r\nlate in life. I am not strong enough to bear him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nCUPID PROMPTED\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use the cold language of the world, Mrs Alfred Lammle rapidly\r\nimproved the acquaintance of Miss Podsnap. To use the warm language of\r\nMrs Lammle, she and her sweet Georgiana soon became one: in heart, in\r\nmind, in sentiment, in soul.\r\n\r\nWhenever Georgiana could escape from the thraldom of Podsnappery; could\r\nthrow off the bedclothes of the custard-coloured phaeton, and get up;\r\ncould shrink out of the range of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s rocking, and (so to speak)\r\nrescue her poor little frosty toes from being rocked over; she repaired\r\nto her friend, Mrs Alfred Lammle. Mrs Podsnap by no means objected. As\r\na consciously \xe2\x80\x98splendid woman,\xe2\x80\x99 accustomed to overhear herself so\r\ndenominated by elderly osteologists pursuing their studies in dinner\r\nsociety, Mrs Podsnap could dispense with her daughter. Mr Podsnap, for\r\nhis part, on being informed where Georgiana was, swelled with patronage\r\nof the Lammles. That they, when unable to lay hold of him, should\r\nrespectfully grasp at the hem of his mantle; that they, when they could\r\nnot bask in the glory of him the sun, should take up with the pale\r\nreflected light of the watery young moon his daughter; appeared quite\r\nnatural, becoming, and proper. It gave him a better opinion of the\r\ndiscretion of the Lammles than he had heretofore held, as showing that\r\nthey appreciated the value of the connexion. So, Georgiana repairing\r\nto her friend, Mr Podsnap went out to dinner, and to dinner, and yet to\r\ndinner, arm in arm with Mrs Podsnap: settling his obstinate head in his\r\ncravat and shirt-collar, much as if he were performing on the Pandean\r\npipes, in his own honour, the triumphal march, See the conquering\r\nPodsnap comes, Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!\r\n\r\nIt was a trait in Mr Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s character (and in one form or other\r\nit will be generally seen to pervade the depths and shallows of\r\nPodsnappery), that he could not endure a hint of disparagement of any\r\nfriend or acquaintance of his. \xe2\x80\x98How dare you?\xe2\x80\x99 he would seem to say, in\r\nsuch a case. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean? I have licensed this person. This person\r\nhas taken out MY certificate. Through this person you strike at me,\r\nPodsnap the Great. And it is not that I particularly care for the\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s dignity, but that I do most particularly care for Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHence, if any one in his presence had presumed to doubt the\r\nresponsibility of the Lammles, he would have been mightily huffed. Not\r\nthat any one did, for Veneering, M.P., was always the authority for\r\ntheir being very rich, and perhaps believed it. As indeed he might, if\r\nhe chose, for anything he knew of the matter.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s house in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, was but\r\na temporary residence. It has done well enough, they informed their\r\nfriends, for Mr Lammle when a bachelor, but it would not do now. So,\r\nthey were always looking at palatial residences in the best situations,\r\nand always very nearly taking or buying one, but never quite concluding\r\nthe bargain. Hereby they made for themselves a shining little reputation\r\napart. People said, on seeing a vacant palatial residence, \xe2\x80\x98The very\r\nthing for the Lammles!\xe2\x80\x99 and wrote to the Lammles about it, and the\r\nLammles always went to look at it, but unfortunately it never exactly\r\nanswered. In short, they suffered so many disappointments, that they\r\nbegan to think it would be necessary to build a palatial residence.\r\nAnd hereby they made another shining reputation; many persons of their\r\nacquaintance becoming by anticipation dissatisfied with their own\r\nhouses, and envious of the non-existent Lammle structure.\r\n\r\nThe handsome fittings and furnishings of the house in Sackville Street\r\nwere piled thick and high over the skeleton up-stairs, and if it ever\r\nwhispered from under its load of upholstery, \xe2\x80\x98Here I am in the closet!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit was to very few ears, and certainly never to Miss Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s. What\r\nMiss Podsnap was particularly charmed with, next to the graces of\r\nher friend, was the happiness of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s married life. This was\r\nfrequently their theme of conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Lammle is like a lover. At least\r\nI--I should think he was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Georgiana, darling!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, holding up a forefinger, \xe2\x80\x98Take\r\ncare!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my goodness me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Podsnap, reddening. \xe2\x80\x98What have I\r\nsaid now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 hinted Mrs Lammle, playfully shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nwere never to say Mr Lammle any more, Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Alfred, then. I am glad it\xe2\x80\x99s no worse. I was afraid I had said\r\nsomething shocking. I am always saying something wrong to ma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To me, Georgiana dearest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not to you; you are not ma. I wish you were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle bestowed a sweet and loving smile upon her friend, which Miss\r\nPodsnap returned as she best could. They sat at lunch in Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown boudoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so, dearest Georgiana, Alfred is like your notion of a lover?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 Georgiana replied, beginning to conceal\r\nher elbows. \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t any notion of a lover. The dreadful wretches that\r\nma brings up at places to torment me, are not lovers. I only mean that\r\nMr--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again, dearest Georgiana?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That Alfred--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sounds much better, darling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Loves you so. He always treats you with such delicate gallantry and\r\nattention. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, with a rather singular expression\r\ncrossing her face. \xe2\x80\x98I believe that he loves me, fully as much as I love\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, what happiness!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But do you know, my Georgiana,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle resumed presently, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nthere is something suspicious in your enthusiastic sympathy with\r\nAlfred\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good gracious no, I hope not!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it rather suggest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle archly, \xe2\x80\x98that my\r\nGeorgiana\xe2\x80\x99s little heart is--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Podsnap blushingly besought her. \xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t! I\r\nassure you, Sophronia, that I only praise Alfred, because he is your\r\nhusband and so fond of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSophronia\xe2\x80\x99s glance was as if a rather new light broke in upon her. It\r\nshaded off into a cool smile, as she said, with her eyes upon her lunch,\r\nand her eyebrows raised:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite wrong, my love, in your guess at my meaning. What I\r\ninsinuated was, that my Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s little heart was growing conscious\r\nof a vacancy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Georgiana. \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anybody say anything to\r\nme in that way for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many thousand pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what way, my Georgiana?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mrs Lammle, still smiling coolly\r\nwith her eyes upon her lunch, and her eyebrows raised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU know,\xe2\x80\x99 returned poor little Miss Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98I think I should go out\r\nof my mind, Sophronia, with vexation and shyness and detestation, if\r\nanybody did. It\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me to see how loving you and your husband\r\nare. That\xe2\x80\x99s a different thing. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to have anything of that\r\nsort going on with myself. I should beg and pray to--to have the person\r\ntaken away and trampled upon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAh! here was Alfred. Having stolen in unobserved, he playfully leaned on\r\nthe back of Sophronia\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and, as Miss Podsnap saw him, put one\r\nof Sophronia\xe2\x80\x99s wandering locks to his lips, and waved a kiss from it\r\ntowards Miss Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is this about husbands and detestations?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the captivating\r\nAlfred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, they say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his wife, \xe2\x80\x98that listeners never hear any good\r\nof themselves; though you--but pray how long have you been here, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This instant arrived, my own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I may go on--though if you had been here but a moment or two\r\nsooner, you would have heard your praises sounded by Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only, if they were to be called praises at all which I really don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink they were,\xe2\x80\x99 explained Miss Podsnap in a flutter, \xe2\x80\x98for being so\r\ndevoted to Sophronia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Alfred. \xe2\x80\x98My life!\xe2\x80\x99 and kissed her hand. In return\r\nfor which she kissed his watch-chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it was not I who was to be taken away and trampled upon, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Alfred, drawing a seat between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask Georgiana, my soul,\xe2\x80\x99 replied his wife.\r\n\r\nAlfred touchingly appealed to Georgiana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it was nobody,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Podsnap. \xe2\x80\x98It was nonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if you are determined to know, Mr Inquisitive Pet, as I suppose you\r\nare,\xe2\x80\x99 said the happy and fond Sophronia, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98it was any one who\r\nshould venture to aspire to Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mr Lammle, becoming graver, \xe2\x80\x98you are\r\nnot serious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his wife, \xe2\x80\x98I dare say Georgiana was not, but\r\nI am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98shows the accidental combinations that\r\nthere are in things! Could you believe, my Ownest, that I came in here\r\nwith the name of an aspirant to our Georgiana on my lips?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I could believe, Alfred,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98anything that YOU\r\ntold me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You dear one! And I anything that YOU told me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow delightful those interchanges, and the looks accompanying them! Now,\r\nif the skeleton up-stairs had taken that opportunity, for instance, of\r\ncalling out \xe2\x80\x98Here I am, suffocating in the closet!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I give you my honour, my dear Sophronia--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I know what that is, love,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do, my darling--that I came into the room all but uttering young\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s name. Tell Georgiana, dearest, about young Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no, don\xe2\x80\x99t! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Podsnap, putting her fingers in\r\nher ears. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle laughed in her gayest manner, and, removing her Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunresisting hands, and playfully holding them in her own at arms\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlength, sometimes near together and sometimes wide apart, went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must know, you dearly beloved little goose, that once upon a\r\ntime there was a certain person called young Fledgeby. And this young\r\nFledgeby, who was of an excellent family and rich, was known to two\r\nother certain persons, dearly attached to one another and called Mr and\r\nMrs Alfred Lammle. So this young Fledgeby, being one night at the play,\r\nthere sees with Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle, a certain heroine called--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t say Georgiana Podsnap!\xe2\x80\x99 pleaded that young lady almost in\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh do do do say somebody else! Not Georgiana\r\nPodsnap. Oh don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No other,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, laughing airily, and, full of affectionate\r\nblandishments, opening and closing Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s arms like a pair of\r\ncompasses, \xe2\x80\x98than my little Georgiana Podsnap. So this young Fledgeby goes\r\nto that Alfred Lammle and says--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh ple-e-e-ease don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 Georgiana, as if the supplication were being\r\nsqueezed out of her by powerful compression. \xe2\x80\x98I so hate him for saying\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For saying what, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Mrs Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he said,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Georgiana wildly, \xe2\x80\x98but I hate him\r\nall the same for saying it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, always laughing in her most captivating way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the poor young fellow only says that he is stricken all of a heap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, what shall I ever do!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Georgiana. \xe2\x80\x98Oh my goodness what a\r\nFool he must be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--And implores to be asked to dinner, and to make a fourth at the play\r\nanother time. And so he dines to-morrow and goes to the Opera with\r\nus. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Except, my dear Georgiana--and what will you think of\r\nthis!--that he is infinitely shyer than you, and far more afraid of you\r\nthan you ever were of any one in all your days!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn perturbation of mind Miss Podsnap still fumed and plucked at her\r\nhands a little, but could not help laughing at the notion of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing afraid of her. With that advantage, Sophronia flattered her and\r\nrallied her more successfully, and then the insinuating Alfred flattered\r\nher and rallied her, and promised that at any moment when she might\r\nrequire that service at his hands, he would take young Fledgeby out and\r\ntrample on him. Thus it remained amicably understood that young Fledgeby\r\nwas to come to admire, and that Georgiana was to come to be admired; and\r\nGeorgiana with the entirely new sensation in her breast of having that\r\nprospect before her, and with many kisses from her dear Sophronia in\r\npresent possession, preceded six feet one of discontented footman (an\r\namount of the article that always came for her when she walked home) to\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe happy pair being left together, Mrs Lammle said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I understand this girl, sir, your dangerous fascinations have\r\nproduced some effect upon her. I mention the conquest in good time\r\nbecause I apprehend your scheme to be more important to you than your\r\nvanity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a mirror on the wall before them, and her eyes just caught\r\nhim smirking in it. She gave the reflected image a look of the deepest\r\ndisdain, and the image received it in the glass. Next moment they\r\nquietly eyed each other, as if they, the principals, had had no part in\r\nthat expressive transaction.\r\n\r\nIt may have been that Mrs Lammle tried in some manner to excuse her\r\nconduct to herself by depreciating the poor little victim of whom she\r\nspoke with acrimonious contempt. It may have been too that in this she\r\ndid not quite succeed, for it is very difficult to resist confidence,\r\nand she knew she had Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said between the happy pair. Perhaps conspirators\r\nwho have once established an understanding, may not be over-fond of\r\nrepeating the terms and objects of their conspiracy. Next day came; came\r\nGeorgiana; and came Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nGeorgiana had by this time seen a good deal of the house and its\r\nfrequenters. As there was a certain handsome room with a billiard table\r\nin it--on the ground floor, eating out a backyard--which might have\r\nbeen Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s office, or library, but was called by neither name, but\r\nsimply Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s room, so it would have been hard for stronger female\r\nheads than Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s to determine whether its frequenters were men\r\nof pleasure or men of business. Between the room and the men there were\r\nstrong points of general resemblance. Both were too gaudy, too slangey,\r\ntoo odorous of cigars, and too much given to horseflesh; the latter\r\ncharacteristic being exemplified in the room by its decorations, and in\r\nthe men by their conversation. High-stepping horses seemed necessary to\r\nall Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s friends--as necessary as their transaction of business\r\ntogether in a gipsy way at untimely hours of the morning and evening,\r\nand in rushes and snatches. There were friends who seemed to be always\r\ncoming and going across the Channel, on errands about the Bourse, and\r\nGreek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount\r\nand three quarters and seven eighths. There were other friends who\r\nseemed to be always lolling and lounging in and out of the City, on\r\nquestions of the Bourse, and Greek and Spanish and India and Mexican and\r\npar and premium and discount and three quarters and seven eighths. They\r\nwere all feverish, boastful, and indefinably loose; and they all ate and\r\ndrank a great deal; and made bets in eating and drinking. They all spoke\r\nof sums of money, and only mentioned the sums and left the money to\r\nbe understood; as \xe2\x80\x98five and forty thousand Tom,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Two hundred and\r\ntwenty-two on every individual share in the lot Joe.\xe2\x80\x99 They seemed to\r\ndivide the world into two classes of people; people who were making\r\nenormous fortunes, and people who were being enormously ruined. They\r\nwere always in a hurry, and yet seemed to have nothing tangible to do;\r\nexcept a few of them (these, mostly asthmatic and thick-lipped) who were\r\nfor ever demonstrating to the rest, with gold pencil-cases which they\r\ncould hardly hold because of the big rings on their forefingers, how\r\nmoney was to be made. Lastly, they all swore at their grooms, and the\r\ngrooms were not quite as respectful or complete as other men\xe2\x80\x99s grooms;\r\nseeming somehow to fall short of the groom point as their masters fell\r\nshort of the gentleman point.\r\n\r\nYoung Fledgeby was none of these. Young Fledgeby had a peachy cheek,\r\nor a cheek compounded of the peach and the red red red wall on which\r\nit grows, and was an awkward, sandy-haired, small-eyed youth, exceeding\r\nslim (his enemies would have said lanky), and prone to self-examination\r\nin the articles of whisker and moustache. While feeling for the whisker\r\nthat he anxiously expected, Fledgeby underwent remarkable fluctuations\r\nof spirits, ranging along the whole scale from confidence to despair.\r\nThere were times when he started, as exclaiming \xe2\x80\x98By Jupiter here it is\r\nat last!\xe2\x80\x99 There were other times when, being equally depressed, he would\r\nbe seen to shake his head, and give up hope. To see him at those periods\r\nleaning on a chimneypiece, like as on an urn containing the ashes of his\r\nambition, with the cheek that would not sprout, upon the hand on which\r\nthat cheek had forced conviction, was a distressing sight.\r\n\r\nNot so was Fledgeby seen on this occasion. Arrayed in superb raiment,\r\nwith his opera hat under his arm, he concluded his self-examination\r\nhopefully, awaited the arrival of Miss Podsnap, and talked small-talk\r\nwith Mrs Lammle. In facetious homage to the smallness of his talk, and\r\nthe jerky nature of his manners, Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s familiars had agreed to\r\nconfer upon him (behind his back) the honorary title of Fascination\r\nFledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warm weather, Mrs Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination Fledgeby. Mrs Lammle\r\nthought it scarcely as warm as it had been yesterday. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps not,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Fascination Fledgeby, with great quickness of repartee; \xe2\x80\x98but I\r\nexpect it will be devilish warm to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe threw off another little scintillation. \xe2\x80\x98Been out to-day, Mrs\r\nLammle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle answered, for a short drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some people,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98are accustomed to take long\r\ndrives; but it generally appears to me that if they make \xe2\x80\x98em too long,\r\nthey overdo it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBeing in such feather, he might have surpassed himself in his next\r\nsally, had not Miss Podsnap been announced. Mrs Lammle flew to embrace\r\nher darling little Georgy, and when the first transports were over,\r\npresented Mr Fledgeby. Mr Lammle came on the scene last, for he was\r\nalways late, and so were the frequenters always late; all hands being\r\nbound to be made late, by private information about the Bourse, and\r\nGreek and Spanish and India and Mexican and par and premium and discount\r\nand three quarters and seven eighths.\r\n\r\nA handsome little dinner was served immediately, and Mr Lammle sat\r\nsparkling at his end of the table, with his servant behind his chair,\r\nand HIS ever-lingering doubts upon the subject of his wages behind\r\nhimself. Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s utmost powers of sparkling were in requisition\r\nto-day, for Fascination Fledgeby and Georgiana not only struck each\r\nother speechless, but struck each other into astonishing attitudes;\r\nGeorgiana, as she sat facing Fledgeby, making such efforts to conceal\r\nher elbows as were totally incompatible with the use of a knife and\r\nfork; and Fledgeby, as he sat facing Georgiana, avoiding her countenance\r\nby every possible device, and betraying the discomposure of his mind in\r\nfeeling for his whiskers with his spoon, his wine glass, and his bread.\r\n\r\nSo, Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle had to prompt, and this is how they\r\nprompted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Georgiana,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, low and smiling, and sparkling all over,\r\nlike a harlequin; \xe2\x80\x98you are not in your usual spirits. Why are you not in\r\nyour usual spirits, Georgiana?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGeorgiana faltered that she was much the same as she was in general; she\r\nwas not aware of being different.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not aware of being different!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Alfred Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98You, my dear\r\nGeorgiana! Who are always so natural and unconstrained with us! Who are\r\nsuch a relief from the crowd that are all alike! Who are the embodiment\r\nof gentleness, simplicity, and reality!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Podsnap looked at the door, as if she entertained confused thoughts\r\nof taking refuge from these compliments in flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I will be judged,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, raising his voice a little, \xe2\x80\x98by\r\nmy friend Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh DON\xe2\x80\x99T!\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Podsnap faintly ejaculated: when Mrs Lammle took the\r\nprompt-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Alfred, my dear, but I cannot part with Mr Fledgeby\r\nquite yet; you must wait for him a moment. Mr Fledgeby and I are engaged\r\nin a personal discussion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFledgeby must have conducted it on his side with immense art, for no\r\nappearance of uttering one syllable had escaped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A personal discussion, Sophronia, my love? What discussion? Fledgeby, I\r\nam jealous. What discussion, Fledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I tell him, Mr Fledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Lammle.\r\n\r\nTrying to look as if he knew anything about it, Fascination replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, tell him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We were discussing then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98if you MUST know, Alfred,\r\nwhether Mr Fledgeby was in his usual flow of spirits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, that is the very point, Sophronia, that Georgiana and I were\r\ndiscussing as to herself! What did Fledgeby say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, a likely thing, sir, that I am going to tell you everything, and be\r\ntold nothing! What did Georgiana say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Georgiana said she was doing her usual justice to herself to-day, and I\r\nsaid she was not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98what I said to Mr Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99 Still,\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. They would not look at one another. No, not even\r\nwhen the sparkling host proposed that the quartette should take an\r\nappropriately sparkling glass of wine. Georgiana looked from her wine\r\nglass at Mr Lammle and at Mrs Lammle; but mightn\xe2\x80\x99t, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, look at Mr Fledgeby. Fascination looked from his wine glass\r\nat Mrs Lammle and at Mr Lammle; but mightn\xe2\x80\x99t, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, look at Georgiana.\r\n\r\nMore prompting was necessary. Cupid must be brought up to the mark. The\r\nmanager had put him down in the bill for the part, and he must play it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the colour of your\r\ndress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I appeal,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98to Mr Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98to Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Georgy, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Mrs Lammle aside to her dear girl, \xe2\x80\x98I rely\r\nupon you not to go over to the opposition. Now, Mr Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFascination wished to know if the colour were not called rose-colour?\r\nYes, said Mr Lammle; actually he knew everything; it was really\r\nrose-colour. Fascination took rose-colour to mean the colour of roses.\r\n(In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and Mrs Lammle.) Fascination\r\nhad heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose. Similarly, it\r\nmight be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses. [\xe2\x80\x98Very happy,\r\nFledgeby!\xe2\x80\x99 from Mr Lammle.) Notwithstanding, Fascination\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\r\nwas that we all had our eyes--or at least a large majority of us--and\r\nthat--and--and his farther opinion was several ands, with nothing beyond\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98to desert me in that way! Oh, Mr\r\nFledgeby, to abandon my poor dear injured rose and declare for blue!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Victory, victory!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Lammle; \xe2\x80\x98your dress is condemned, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, stealing her affectionate hand towards her\r\ndear girl\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x98what does Georgy say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She says,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Lammle, interpreting for her, \xe2\x80\x98that in her eyes\r\nyou look well in any colour, Sophronia, and that if she had expected to\r\nbe embarrassed by so pretty a compliment as she has received, she would\r\nhave worn another colour herself. Though I tell her, in reply, that it\r\nwould not have saved her, for whatever colour she had worn would have\r\nbeen Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s colour. But what does Fledgeby say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs Lammle, interpreting for him, and patting the\r\nback of her dear girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand, as if it were Fledgeby who was patting it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that it was no compliment, but a little natural act of homage that\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist. And,\xe2\x80\x99 expressing more feeling as if it were more\r\nfeeling on the part of Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98he is right, he is right!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill, no not even now, would they look at one another. Seeming to gnash\r\nhis sparkling teeth, studs, eyes, and buttons, all at once, Mr Lammle\r\nsecretly bent a dark frown on the two, expressive of an intense desire\r\nto bring them together by knocking their heads together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you heard this opera of to-night, Fledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, stopping\r\nvery short, to prevent himself from running on into \xe2\x80\x98confound you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why no, not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98In fact I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a note of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither do you know it, Georgy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98N-no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nGeorgiana, faintly, under the sympathetic coincidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, charmed by the discovery which flowed from\r\nthe premises, \xe2\x80\x98you neither of you know it! How charming!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven the craven Fledgeby felt that the time was now come when he must\r\nstrike a blow. He struck it by saying, partly to Mrs Lammle and partly\r\nto the circumambient air, \xe2\x80\x98I consider myself very fortunate in being\r\nreserved by--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he stopped dead, Mr Lammle, making that gingerous bush of his\r\nwhiskers to look out of, offered him the word \xe2\x80\x98Destiny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to say that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I was going to say\r\nFate. I consider it very fortunate that Fate has written in the book\r\nof--in the book which is its own property--that I should go to that\r\nopera for the first time under the memorable circumstances of going with\r\nMiss Podsnap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which Georgiana replied, hooking her two little fingers in one\r\nanother, and addressing the tablecloth, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, but I generally go\r\nwith no one but you, Sophronia, and I like that very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nContent perforce with this success for the time, Mr Lammle let Miss\r\nPodsnap out of the room, as if he were opening her cage door, and Mrs\r\nLammle followed. Coffee being presently served up stairs, he kept a\r\nwatch on Fledgeby until Miss Podsnap\xe2\x80\x99s cup was empty, and then directed\r\nhim with his finger (as if that young gentleman were a slow Retriever)\r\nto go and fetch it. This feat he performed, not only without failure,\r\nbut even with the original embellishment of informing Miss Podsnap that\r\ngreen tea was considered bad for the nerves. Though there Miss Podsnap\r\nunintentionally threw him out by faltering, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, is it indeed? How does\r\nit act?\xe2\x80\x99 Which he was not prepared to elucidate.\r\n\r\nThe carriage announced, Mrs Lammle said; \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me, Mr Fledgeby, my\r\nskirts and cloak occupy both my hands, take Miss Podsnap.\xe2\x80\x99 And he\r\ntook her, and Mrs Lammle went next, and Mr Lammle went last, savagely\r\nfollowing his little flock, like a drover.\r\n\r\nBut he was all sparkle and glitter in the box at the Opera, and there he\r\nand his dear wife made a conversation between Fledgeby and Georgiana in\r\nthe following ingenious and skilful manner. They sat in this order:\r\nMrs Lammle, Fascination Fledgeby, Georgiana, Mr Lammle. Mrs Lammle made\r\nleading remarks to Fledgeby, only requiring monosyllabic replies. Mr\r\nLammle did the like with Georgiana. At times Mrs Lammle would lean\r\nforward to address Mr Lammle to this purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred, my dear, Mr Fledgeby very justly says, apropos of the last\r\nscene, that true constancy would not require any such stimulant as the\r\nstage deems necessary.\xe2\x80\x99 To which Mr Lammle would reply, \xe2\x80\x98Ay, Sophronia,\r\nmy love, but as Georgiana has observed to me, the lady had no sufficient\r\nreason to know the state of the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s affections.\xe2\x80\x99 To which Mrs\r\nLammle would rejoin, \xe2\x80\x98Very true, Alfred; but Mr Fledgeby points\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x99 this. To which Alfred would demur: \xe2\x80\x98Undoubtedly, Sophronia, but\r\nGeorgiana acutely remarks,\xe2\x80\x99 that. Through this device the two young\r\npeople conversed at great length and committed themselves to a variety\r\nof delicate sentiments, without having once opened their lips, save to\r\nsay yes or no, and even that not to one another.\r\n\r\nFledgeby took his leave of Miss Podsnap at the carriage door, and the\r\nLammles dropped her at her own home, and on the way Mrs Lammle archly\r\nrallied her, in her fond and protecting manner, by saying at intervals,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh little Georgiana, little Georgiana!\xe2\x80\x99 Which was not much; but the\r\ntone added, \xe2\x80\x98You have enslaved your Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Lammles got home at last, and the lady sat down moody and\r\nweary, looking at her dark lord engaged in a deed of violence with a\r\nbottle of soda-water as though he were wringing the neck of some unlucky\r\ncreature and pouring its blood down his throat. As he wiped his dripping\r\nwhiskers in an ogreish way, he met her eyes, and pausing, said, with no\r\nvery gentle voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was such an absolute Booby necessary to the purpose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know what I am doing. He is no such dolt as you suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A genius, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You sneer, perhaps; and you take a lofty air upon yourself perhaps!\r\nBut I tell you this:--when that young fellow\xe2\x80\x99s interest is concerned,\r\nhe holds as tight as a horse-leech. When money is in question with that\r\nyoung fellow, he is a match for the Devil.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he a match for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is. Almost as good a one as you thought me for you. He has no\r\nquality of youth in him, but such as you have seen to-day. Touch him\r\nupon money, and you touch no booby then. He really is a dolt, I suppose,\r\nin other things; but it answers his one purpose very well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she money in her own right in any case?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! she has money in her own right in any case. You have done so well\r\nto-day, Sophronia, that I answer the question, though you know I object\r\nto any such questions. You have done so well to-day, Sophronia, that you\r\nmust be tired. Get to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nMERCURY PROMPTING\r\n\r\n\r\nFledgeby deserved Mr Alfred Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s eulogium. He was the meanest\r\ncur existing, with a single pair of legs. And instinct (a word we all\r\nclearly understand) going largely on four legs, and reason always on\r\ntwo, meanness on four legs never attains the perfection of meanness on\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe father of this young gentleman had been a money-lender, who\r\nhad transacted professional business with the mother of this\r\nyoung gentleman, when he, the latter, was waiting in the vast dark\r\nante-chambers of the present world to be born. The lady, a widow, being\r\nunable to pay the money-lender, married him; and in due course, Fledgeby\r\nwas summoned out of the vast dark ante-chambers to come and be presented\r\nto the Registrar-General. Rather a curious speculation how Fledgeby\r\nwould otherwise have disposed of his leisure until Doomsday.\r\n\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s mother offended her family by marrying Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s father. It\r\nis one of the easiest achievements in life to offend your family when\r\nyour family want to get rid of you. Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s family had\r\nbeen very much offended with her for being poor, and broke with her\r\nfor becoming comparatively rich. Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s family was the\r\nSnigsworth family. She had even the high honour to be cousin to Lord\r\nSnigsworth--so many times removed that the noble Earl would have had no\r\ncompunction in removing her one time more and dropping her clean outside\r\nthe cousinly pale; but cousin for all that.\r\n\r\nAmong her pre-matrimonial transactions with Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s father,\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s mother had raised money of him at a great disadvantage on a\r\ncertain reversionary interest. The reversion falling in soon after they\r\nwere married, Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s father laid hold of the cash for his separate\r\nuse and benefit. This led to subjective differences of opinion, not to\r\nsay objective interchanges of boot-jacks, backgammon boards, and other\r\nsuch domestic missiles, between Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s father and Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\r\nand those led to Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s mother spending as much money as she\r\ncould, and to Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s father doing all he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t to restrain her.\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s childhood had been, in consequence, a stormy one; but the\r\nwinds and the waves had gone down in the grave, and Fledgeby flourished\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nHe lived in chambers in the Albany, did Fledgeby, and maintained a\r\nspruce appearance. But his youthful fire was all composed of sparks from\r\nthe grindstone; and as the sparks flew off, went out, and never warmed\r\nanything, be sure that Fledgeby had his tools at the grindstone, and\r\nturned it with a wary eye.\r\n\r\nMr Alfred Lammle came round to the Albany to breakfast with Fledgeby.\r\nPresent on the table, one scanty pot of tea, one scanty loaf, two scanty\r\npats of butter, two scanty rashers of bacon, two pitiful eggs, and an\r\nabundance of handsome china bought a secondhand bargain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you think of Georgiana?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, very deliberately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do, my boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You misunderstand me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that.\r\nI mean I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me anything, old fellow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, but there you misunderstand me again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I mean I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle sparkled at him, but frowned at him too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re deep and you\xe2\x80\x99re ready. Whether I am\r\ndeep or not, never mind. I am not ready. But I can do one thing, Lammle,\r\nI can hold my tongue. And I intend always doing it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a long-headed fellow, Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May be, or may not be. If I am a short-tongued fellow, it may amount to\r\nthe same thing. Now, Lammle, I am never going to answer questions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow, it was the simplest question in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind. It seemed so, but things are not always what they seem. I\r\nsaw a man examined as a witness in Westminster Hall. Questions put to\r\nhim seemed the simplest in the world, but turned out to be anything\r\nrather than that, after he had answered \xe2\x80\x98em. Very well. Then he should\r\nhave held his tongue. If he had held his tongue he would have kept out\r\nof scrapes that he got into.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had held my tongue, you would never have seen the subject of my\r\nquestion,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Lammle, darkening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination Fledgeby, calmly feeling for his\r\nwhisker, \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be led on into a discussion. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmanage a discussion. But I can manage to hold my tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Lammle fell back upon propitiation. \xe2\x80\x98I should think you could!\r\nWhy, when these fellows of our acquaintance drink and you drink with\r\nthem, the more talkative they get, the more silent you get. The more\r\nthey let out, the more you keep in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t object, Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby, with an internal chuckle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to being understood, though I object to being questioned. That\r\ncertainly IS the way I do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when all the rest of us are discussing our ventures, none of us\r\never know what a single venture of yours is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And none of you ever will from me, Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Fledgeby, with\r\nanother internal chuckle; \xe2\x80\x98that certainly IS the way I do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why of course it is, I know!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Lammle, with a flourish of\r\nfrankness, and a laugh, and stretching out his hands as if to show\r\nthe universe a remarkable man in Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t known it of my\r\nFledgeby, should I have proposed our little compact of advantage, to my\r\nFledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Fascination, shaking his head slyly. \xe2\x80\x98But I am not to\r\nbe got at in that way. I am not vain. That sort of vanity don\xe2\x80\x99t pay,\r\nLammle. No, no, no. Compliments only make me hold my tongue the more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlfred Lammle pushed his plate away (no great sacrifice under the\r\ncircumstances of there being so little in it), thrust his hands in his\r\npockets, leaned back in his chair, and contemplated Fledgeby in silence.\r\nThen he slowly released his left hand from its pocket, and made that\r\nbush of his whiskers, still contemplating him in silence. Then he slowly\r\nbroke silence, and slowly said: \xe2\x80\x98What--the--Dev-il is this fellow about\r\nthis morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, look here, Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination Fledgeby, with the meanest\r\nof twinkles in his meanest of eyes: which were too near together, by\r\nthe way: \xe2\x80\x98look here, Lammle; I am very well aware that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t show to\r\nadvantage last night, and that you and your wife--who, I consider, is\r\na very clever woman and an agreeable woman--did. I am not calculated to\r\nshow to advantage under that sort of circumstances. I know very well you\r\ntwo did show to advantage, and managed capitally. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you on that\r\naccount come talking to me as if I was your doll and puppet, because I\r\nam not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And all this,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Alfred, after studying with a look the meanness\r\nthat was fain to have the meanest help, and yet was so mean as to turn\r\nupon it: \xe2\x80\x98all this because of one simple natural question!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should have waited till I thought proper to say something about it\r\nof myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your coming over me with your Georgianas, as if\r\nyou was her proprietor and mine too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, when you are in the gracious mind to say anything about it of\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98pray do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have done it. I have said you managed capitally. You and your wife\r\nboth. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll go on managing capitally, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on doing my part. Only\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t crow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I crow!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Lammle, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the other--\xe2\x80\x98or take it in your head that people are your\r\npuppets because they don\xe2\x80\x99t come out to advantage at the particular\r\nmoments when you do, with the assistance of a very clever and agreeable\r\nwife. All the rest keep on doing, and let Mrs Lammle keep on doing. Now,\r\nI have held my tongue when I thought proper, and I have spoken when I\r\nthought proper, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of that. And now the question is,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nproceeded Fledgeby, with the greatest reluctance, \xe2\x80\x98will you have another\r\negg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99re right and will find yourself better without it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nFascination, in greatly improved spirits. \xe2\x80\x98To ask you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nanother rasher would be unmeaning flattery, for it would make you\r\nthirsty all day. Will you have some more bread and butter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination. And it was not a mere retort for the\r\nsound\xe2\x80\x99s sake, but was a cheerful cogent consequence of the refusal; for\r\nif Lammle had applied himself again to the loaf, it would have been so\r\nheavily visited, in Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, as to demand abstinence from\r\nbread, on his part, for the remainder of that meal at least, if not for\r\nthe whole of the next.\r\n\r\nWhether this young gentleman (for he was but three-and-twenty) combined\r\nwith the miserly vice of an old man, any of the open-handed vices of\r\na young one, was a moot point; so very honourably did he keep his own\r\ncounsel. He was sensible of the value of appearances as an investment,\r\nand liked to dress well; but he drove a bargain for every moveable about\r\nhim, from the coat on his back to the china on his breakfast-table;\r\nand every bargain by representing somebody\xe2\x80\x99s ruin or somebody\xe2\x80\x99s loss,\r\nacquired a peculiar charm for him. It was a part of his avarice to take,\r\nwithin narrow bounds, long odds at races; if he won, he drove harder\r\nbargains; if he lost, he half starved himself until next time. Why money\r\nshould be so precious to an Ass too dull and mean to exchange it for any\r\nother satisfaction, is strange; but there is no animal so sure to get\r\nladen with it, as the Ass who sees nothing written on the face of the\r\nearth and sky but the three letters L. S. D.--not Luxury, Sensuality,\r\nDissoluteness, which they often stand for, but the three dry letters.\r\nYour concentrated Fox is seldom comparable to your concentrated Ass in\r\nmoney-breeding.\r\n\r\nFascination Fledgeby feigned to be a young gentleman living on his\r\nmeans, but was known secretly to be a kind of outlaw in the bill-broking\r\nline, and to put money out at high interest in various ways. His circle\r\nof familiar acquaintance, from Mr Lammle round, all had a touch of the\r\noutlaw, as to their rovings in the merry greenwood of Jobbery Forest,\r\nlying on the outskirts of the Share-Market and the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you, Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, eating his bread and butter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98always did go in for female society?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lammle, glooming considerably under his late\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Came natural to you, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sex were pleased to like me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle sulkily, but with\r\nthe air of a man who had not been able to help himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Made a pretty good thing of marrying, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nThe other smiled (an ugly smile), and tapped one tap upon his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My late governor made a mess of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98But Geor--is the\r\nright name Georgina or Georgiana?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking yesterday, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there was such a name. I\r\nthought it must end in ina.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you play--if you can--the Concertina, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied\r\nFledgeby, meditating very slowly. \xe2\x80\x98And you have--when you catch it--the\r\nScarlatina. And you can come down from a balloon in a parach--no you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t though. Well, say Georgeute--I mean Georgiana.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were going to remark of Georgiana--?\xe2\x80\x99 Lammle moodily hinted, after\r\nwaiting in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was going to remark of Georgiana, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, not at all\r\npleased to be reminded of his having forgotten it, \xe2\x80\x98that she don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto be violent. Don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be of the pitching-in order.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has the gentleness of the dove, Mr Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll say so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Fledgeby, sharpening, the moment his\r\ninterest was touched by another. \xe2\x80\x98But you know, the real look-out is\r\nthis:--what I say, not what you say. I say having my late governor\r\nand my late mother in my eye--that Georgiana don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be of the\r\npitching-in order.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe respected Mr Lammle was a bully, by nature and by usual practice.\r\nPerceiving, as Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s affronts cumulated, that conciliation by no\r\nmeans answered the purpose here, he now directed a scowling look\r\ninto Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s small eyes for the effect of the opposite treatment.\r\nSatisfied by what he saw there, he burst into a violent passion and\r\nstruck his hand upon the table, making the china ring and dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a very offensive fellow, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Lammle, rising. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nare a highly offensive scoundrel. What do you mean by this behaviour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t break out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a very offensive fellow sir,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98You are a\r\nhighly offensive scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I SAY, you know!\xe2\x80\x99 urged Fledgeby, quailing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you coarse and vulgar vagabond!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, looking fiercely\r\nabout him, \xe2\x80\x98if your servant was here to give me sixpence of your\r\nmoney to get my boots cleaned afterwards--for you are not worth the\r\nexpenditure--I\xe2\x80\x99d kick you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 pleaded Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure you\xe2\x80\x99d think better of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you what, Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle advancing on him. \xe2\x80\x98Since\r\nyou presume to contradict me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll assert myself a little. Give me your\r\nnose!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFledgeby covered it with his hand instead, and said, retreating, \xe2\x80\x98I beg\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me your nose, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Lammle.\r\n\r\nStill covering that feature and backing, Mr Fledgeby reiterated\r\n(apparently with a severe cold in his head), \xe2\x80\x98I beg, I beg, you won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Lammle, stopping and making the most of his\r\nchest--\xe2\x80\x98This fellow presumes on my having selected him out of all the\r\nyoung fellows I know, for an advantageous opportunity! This fellow\r\npresumes on my having in my desk round the corner, his dirty note of\r\nhand for a wretched sum payable on the occurrence of a certain event,\r\nwhich event can only be of my and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s bringing about! This fellow,\r\nFledgeby, presumes to be impertinent to me, Lammle. Give me your nose\r\nsir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! Stop! I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, with humility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mr Lammle, seeming too furious to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Repeat your words louder, sir. The just indignation of a gentleman has\r\nsent the blood boiling to my head. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Fledgeby, with laborious explanatory politeness, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nbeg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle paused. \xe2\x80\x98As a man of honour,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, throwing himself into a\r\nchair, \xe2\x80\x98I am disarmed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby also took a chair, though less demonstratively, and by\r\nslow approaches removed his hand from his nose. Some natural diffidence\r\nassailed him as to blowing it, so shortly after its having assumed a\r\npersonal and delicate, not to say public, character; but he overcame\r\nhis scruples by degrees, and modestly took that liberty under an implied\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 he said sneakingly, when that was done, \xe2\x80\x98I hope we are friends\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98say no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must have gone too far in making myself disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I never intended it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say no more, say no more!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Lammle repeated in a magnificent tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me your\xe2\x80\x99--Fledgeby started--\xe2\x80\x98hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and on Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s part, in particular, there ensued\r\ngreat geniality. For, he was quite as much of a dastard as the other,\r\nand had been in equal danger of falling into the second place for good,\r\nwhen he took heart just in time, to act upon the information conveyed to\r\nhim by Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast ended in a perfect understanding. Incessant machinations\r\nwere to be kept at work by Mr and Mrs Lammle; love was to be made for\r\nFledgeby, and conquest was to be insured to him; he on his part\r\nvery humbly admitting his defects as to the softer social arts, and\r\nentreating to be backed to the utmost by his two able coadjutors.\r\n\r\nLittle recked Mr Podsnap of the traps and toils besetting his Young\r\nPerson. He regarded her as safe within the Temple of Podsnappery, hiding\r\nthe fulness of time when she, Georgiana, should take him, Fitz-Podsnap,\r\nwho with all his worldly goods should her endow. It would call a blush\r\ninto the cheek of his standard Young Person to have anything to do with\r\nsuch matters save to take as directed, and with worldly goods as per\r\nsettlement to be endowed. Who giveth this woman to be married to this\r\nman? I, Podsnap. Perish the daring thought that any smaller creation\r\nshould come between!\r\n\r\nIt was a public holiday, and Fledgeby did not recover his spirits or his\r\nusual temperature of nose until the afternoon. Walking into the City in\r\nthe holiday afternoon, he walked against a living stream setting out of\r\nit; and thus, when he turned into the precincts of St Mary Axe, he found\r\na prevalent repose and quiet there. A yellow overhanging plaster-fronted\r\nhouse at which he stopped was quiet too. The blinds were all drawn down,\r\nand the inscription Pubsey and Co. seemed to doze in the counting-house\r\nwindow on the ground-floor giving on the sleepy street.\r\n\r\nFledgeby knocked and rang, and Fledgeby rang and knocked, but no\r\none came. Fledgeby crossed the narrow street and looked up at the\r\nhouse-windows, but nobody looked down at Fledgeby. He got out of temper,\r\ncrossed the narrow street again, and pulled the housebell as if it were\r\nthe house\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and he were taking a hint from his late experience.\r\nHis ear at the keyhole seemed then, at last, to give him assurance that\r\nsomething stirred within. His eye at the keyhole seemed to confirm his\r\near, for he angrily pulled the house\xe2\x80\x99s nose again, and pulled and pulled\r\nand continued to pull, until a human nose appeared in the dark doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98These are nice games!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe addressed an old Jewish man in an ancient coat, long of skirt, and\r\nwide of pocket. A venerable man, bald and shining at the top of his\r\nhead, and with long grey hair flowing down at its sides and mingling\r\nwith his beard. A man who with a graceful Eastern action of homage bent\r\nhis head, and stretched out his hands with the palms downward, as if to\r\ndeprecate the wrath of a superior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you been up to?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, storming at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Generous Christian master,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the Jewish man, \xe2\x80\x98it being holiday, I\r\nlooked for no one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Holiday he blowed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, entering. \xe2\x80\x98What have YOU got to do\r\nwith holidays? Shut the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith his former action the old man obeyed. In the entry hung his rusty\r\nlarge-brimmed low-crowned hat, as long out of date as his coat; in the\r\ncorner near it stood his staff--no walking-stick but a veritable staff.\r\nFledgeby turned into the counting-house, perched himself on a business\r\nstool, and cocked his hat. There were light boxes on shelves in the\r\ncounting-house, and strings of mock beads hanging up. There were samples\r\nof cheap clocks, and samples of cheap vases of flowers. Foreign toys,\r\nall.\r\n\r\nPerched on the stool with his hat cocked on his head and one of his legs\r\ndangling, the youth of Fledgeby hardly contrasted to advantage with the\r\nage of the Jewish man as he stood with his bare head bowed, and his eyes\r\n(which he only raised in speaking) on the ground. His clothing was worn\r\ndown to the rusty hue of the hat in the entry, but though he looked\r\nshabby he did not look mean. Now, Fledgeby, though not shabby, did look\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not told me what you were up to, you sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby,\r\nscratching his head with the brim of his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I was breathing the air.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the cellar, that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the house-top.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my soul! That\xe2\x80\x99s a way of doing business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 the old man represented with a grave and patient air, \xe2\x80\x98there must\r\nbe two parties to the transaction of business, and the holiday has left\r\nme alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Can\xe2\x80\x99t be buyer and seller too. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Jews say; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least we say truly, if we say so,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the old man with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your people need speak the truth sometimes, for they lie enough,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nremarked Fascination Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, there is,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the old man with quiet emphasis, \xe2\x80\x98too much\r\nuntruth among all denominations of men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRather dashed, Fascination Fledgeby took another scratch at his\r\nintellectual head with his hat, to gain time for rallying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For instance,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed, as though it were he who had spoken last,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98who but you and I ever heard of a poor Jew?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Jews,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, raising his eyes from the ground with his\r\nformer smile. \xe2\x80\x98They hear of poor Jews often, and are very good to them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bother that!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98You know what I mean. You\xe2\x80\x99d persuade\r\nme if you could, that you are a poor Jew. I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d confess how much\r\nyou really did make out of my late governor. I should have a better\r\nopinion of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man only bent his head, and stretched out his hands as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go on posturing like a Deaf and Dumb School,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ingenious\r\nFledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98but express yourself like a Christian--or as nearly as you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had had sickness and misfortunes, and was so poor,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x98as hopelessly to owe the father, principal and interest. The son\r\ninheriting, was so merciful as to forgive me both, and place me here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made a little gesture as though he kissed the hem of an imaginary\r\ngarment worn by the noble youth before him. It was humbly done, but\r\npicturesquely, and was not abasing to the doer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t say more, I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, looking at him as if he\r\nwould like to try the effect of extracting a double-tooth or two, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nso it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use my putting it to you. But confess this, Riah; who\r\nbelieves you to be poor now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There you\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the old man with a grave slow wave of his head. \xe2\x80\x98All\r\nscout it as a fable. Were I to say \xe2\x80\x9cThis little fancy business is not\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x9d;\xe2\x80\x99 with a lithe sweep of his easily-turning hand around him,\r\nto comprehend the various objects on the shelves; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cit is the little\r\nbusiness of a Christian young gentleman who places me, his servant, in\r\ntrust and charge here, and to whom I am accountable for every single\r\nbead,\xe2\x80\x9d they would laugh. When, in the larger money-business, I tell the\r\nborrowers--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, old chap!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98I hope you mind what you DO\r\ntell \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I tell them no more than I am about to repeat. When I tell them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot promise this, I cannot answer for the other, I must see my\r\nprincipal, I have not the money, I am a poor man and it does not rest\r\nwith me,\xe2\x80\x9d they are so unbelieving and so impatient, that they sometimes\r\ncurse me in Jehovah\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s deuced good, that is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And at other times they say, \xe2\x80\x9cCan it never be done without these\r\ntricks, Mr Riah? Come, come, Mr Riah, we know the arts of your\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x9d--my people!--\xe2\x80\x9cIf the money is to be lent, fetch it, fetch it; if\r\nit is not to be lent, keep it and say so.\xe2\x80\x9d They never believe me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THAT\xe2\x80\x99S all right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe know, Mr Riah, we know. We have but to look at you, and\r\nwe know.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, a good \xe2\x80\x98un are you for the post,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98and a good \xe2\x80\x98un\r\nwas I to mark you out for it! I may be slow, but I am precious sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot a syllable of this reflection shaped itself in any scrap of Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s breath, lest it should tend to put his servant\xe2\x80\x99s price up.\r\nBut looking at the old man as he stood quiet with his head bowed and his\r\neyes cast down, he felt that to relinquish an inch of his baldness,\r\nan inch of his grey hair, an inch of his coat-skirt, an inch of his\r\nhat-brim, an inch of his walking-staff, would be to relinquish hundreds\r\nof pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, mollified by these self-approving\r\nconsiderations. \xe2\x80\x98I want to go a little more into buying-up queer bills.\r\nLook out in that direction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, it shall be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Casting my eye over the accounts, I find that branch of business pays\r\npretty fairly, and I am game for extending it. I like to know people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs likewise. So look out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I will, promptly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Put it about in the right quarters, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll buy queer bills by the\r\nlump--by the pound weight if that\xe2\x80\x99s all--supposing you see your way to a\r\nfair chance on looking over the parcel. And there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing more. Come\r\nto me with the books for periodical inspection as usual, at eight on\r\nMonday morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiah drew some folding tablets from his breast and noted it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all I wanted to say at the present time,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Fledgeby in\r\na grudging vein, as he got off the stool, \xe2\x80\x98except that I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\nthe air where you can hear the bell, or the knocker, either one of the\r\ntwo or both. By-the-by how DO you take the air at the top of the house?\r\nDo you stick your head out of a chimney-pot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, there are leads there, and I have made a little garden there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To bury your money in, you old dodger?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A thumbnail\xe2\x80\x99s space of garden would hold the treasure I bury, master,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Riah. \xe2\x80\x98Twelve shillings a week, even when they are an old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwages, bury themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to know what you really are worth,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby,\r\nwith whom his growing rich on that stipend and gratitude was a very\r\nconvenient fiction. \xe2\x80\x98But come! Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at your garden on the\r\ntiles, before I go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man took a step back, and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, sir, I have company there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you, by George!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby; \xe2\x80\x98I suppose you happen to know\r\nwhose premises these are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, they are yours, and I am your servant in them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I thought you might have overlooked that,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Fledgeby, with\r\nhis eyes on Riah\xe2\x80\x99s beard as he felt for his own; \xe2\x80\x98having company on my\r\npremises, you know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come up and see the guests, sir. I hope for your admission that they\r\ncan do no harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPassing him with a courteous reverence, specially unlike any action that\r\nMr Fledgeby could for his life have imparted to his own head and hands,\r\nthe old man began to ascend the stairs. As he toiled on before, with his\r\npalm upon the stair-rail, and his long black skirt, a very gaberdine,\r\noverhanging each successive step, he might have been the leader in some\r\npilgrimage of devotional ascent to a prophet\xe2\x80\x99s tomb. Not troubled by any\r\nsuch weak imagining, Fascination Fledgeby merely speculated on the time\r\nof life at which his beard had begun, and thought once more what a good\r\n\xe2\x80\x98un he was for the part.\r\n\r\nSome final wooden steps conducted them, stooping under a low penthouse\r\nroof, to the house-top. Riah stood still, and, turning to his master,\r\npointed out his guests.\r\n\r\nLizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren. For whom, perhaps with some old instinct of\r\nhis race, the gentle Jew had spread a carpet. Seated on it, against\r\nno more romantic object than a blackened chimney-stack over which some\r\nbumble creeper had been trained, they both pored over one book; both\r\nwith attentive faces; Jenny with the sharper; Lizzie with the more\r\nperplexed. Another little book or two were lying near, and a common\r\nbasket of common fruit, and another basket full of strings of beads and\r\ntinsel scraps. A few boxes of humble flowers and evergreens completed\r\nthe garden; and the encompassing wilderness of dowager old chimneys\r\ntwirled their cowls and fluttered their smoke, rather as if they were\r\nbridling, and fanning themselves, and looking on in a state of airy\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nTaking her eyes off the book, to test her memory of something in it,\r\nLizzie was the first to see herself observed. As she rose, Miss Wren\r\nlikewise became conscious, and said, irreverently addressing the great\r\nchief of the premises: \xe2\x80\x98Whoever you are, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get up, because my\r\nback\xe2\x80\x99s bad and my legs are queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is my master,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riah, stepping forward.\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t look like anybody\xe2\x80\x99s master,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Miss Wren to herself, with\r\na hitch of her chin and eyes.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the old man, \xe2\x80\x98is a little dressmaker for little\r\npeople. Explain to the master, Jenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dolls; that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny, shortly. \xe2\x80\x98Very difficult to fit too,\r\nbecause their figures are so uncertain. You never know where to expect\r\ntheir waists.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her friend,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the old man, motioning towards Lizzie; \xe2\x80\x98and as\r\nindustrious as virtuous. But that they both are. They are busy early and\r\nlate, sir, early and late; and in bye-times, as on this holiday, they go\r\nto book-learning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much good to be got out of that,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Depends upon the person!\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Miss Wren, snapping him up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I made acquaintance with my guests, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the Jew, with an\r\nevident purpose of drawing out the dressmaker, \xe2\x80\x98through their coming\r\nhere to buy of our damage and waste for Miss Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s millinery. Our\r\nwaste goes into the best of company, sir, on her rosy-cheeked little\r\ncustomers. They wear it in their hair, and on their ball-dresses, and\r\neven (so she tells me) are presented at Court with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, on whose intelligence this doll-fancy made rather\r\nstrong demands; \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99s been buying that basketful to-day, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose she has,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Jenny interposed; \xe2\x80\x98and paying for it too, most\r\nlikely!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look at it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the suspicious chief. Riah handed it to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98How much for this now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two precious silver shillings,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren.\r\n\r\nRiah confirmed her with two nods, as Fledgeby looked to him. A nod for\r\neach shilling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, poking into the contents of the basket with his\r\nforefinger, \xe2\x80\x98the price is not so bad. You have got good measure, Miss\r\nWhat-is-it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested that young lady with great calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have got good measure, Miss Jenny; but the price is not so\r\nbad.--And you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, turning to the other visitor, \xe2\x80\x98do you buy\r\nanything here, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor sell anything neither, miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking askew at the questioner, Jenny stole her hand up to her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s, and drew her friend down, so that she bent beside her on her\r\nknee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are thankful to come here for rest, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny. \xe2\x80\x98You see, you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what the rest of this place is to us; does he, Lizzie? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe quiet, and the air.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The quiet!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Fledgeby, with a contemptuous turn of his head\r\ntowards the City\xe2\x80\x99s roar. \xe2\x80\x98And the air!\xe2\x80\x99 with a \xe2\x80\x98Poof!\xe2\x80\x99 at the smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny. \xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s so high. And you see the clouds rushing\r\non above the narrow streets, not minding them, and you see the golden\r\narrows pointing at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes,\r\nand you feel as if you were dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little creature looked above her, holding up her slight transparent\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you feel when you are dead?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Fledgeby, much perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, so tranquil!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the little creature, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, so peaceful\r\nand so thankful! And you hear the people who are alive, crying, and\r\nworking, and calling to one another down in the close dark streets, and\r\nyou seem to pity them so! And such a chain has fallen from you, and such\r\na strange good sorrowful happiness comes upon you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer eyes fell on the old man, who, with his hands folded, quietly looked\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why it was only just now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little creature, pointing at him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I fancied I saw him come out of his grave! He toiled out at\r\nthat low door so bent and worn, and then he took his breath and stood\r\nupright, and looked all round him at the sky, and the wind blew upon\r\nhim, and his life down in the dark was over!--Till he was called back\r\nto life,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, looking round at Fledgeby with that lower look of\r\nsharpness. \xe2\x80\x98Why did you call him back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was long enough coming, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are not dead, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Get down to life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby seemed to think it rather a good suggestion, and with a nod\r\nturned round. As Riah followed to attend him down the stairs, the little\r\ncreature called out to the Jew in a silvery tone, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be long gone.\r\nCome back, and be dead!\xe2\x80\x99 And still as they went down they heard the\r\nlittle sweet voice, more and more faintly, half calling and half\r\nsinging, \xe2\x80\x98Come back and be dead, Come back and be dead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they got down into the entry, Fledgeby, pausing under the shadow of\r\nthe broad old hat, and mechanically poising the staff, said to the old\r\nman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome girl, that one in her senses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as good as handsome,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At all events,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Fledgeby, with a dry whistle, \xe2\x80\x98I hope she\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t bad enough to put any chap up to the fastenings, and get the\r\npremises broken open. You look out. Keep your weather eye awake and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make any more acquaintances, however handsome. Of course you\r\nalways keep my name to yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, assuredly I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If they ask it, say it\xe2\x80\x99s Pubsey, or say it\xe2\x80\x99s Co, or say it\xe2\x80\x99s anything\r\nyou like, but what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis grateful servant--in whose race gratitude is deep, strong, and\r\nenduring--bowed his head, and actually did now put the hem of his coat\r\nto his lips: though so lightly that the wearer knew nothing of it.\r\n\r\nThus, Fascination Fledgeby went his way, exulting in the artful\r\ncleverness with which he had turned his thumb down on a Jew, and the old\r\nman went his different way up-stairs. As he mounted, the call or song\r\nbegan to sound in his ears again, and, looking above, he saw the face\r\nof the little creature looking down out of a Glory of her long bright\r\nradiant hair, and musically repeating to him, like a vision:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come up and be dead! Come up and be dead!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nA RIDDLE WITHOUT AN ANSWER\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Mr Mortimer Lightwood and Mr Eugene Wrayburn sat together in the\r\nTemple. This evening, however, they were not together in the place of\r\nbusiness of the eminent solicitor, but in another dismal set of\r\nchambers facing it on the same second-floor; on whose dungeon-like black\r\nouter-door appeared the legend:\r\n\r\n\t\tPRIVATE\r\n\r\n\t\tMR EUGENE WRAYBURN\r\n\r\n\t\tMR MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD\r\n\r\n\t\t(Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s Offices opposite.)\r\n\r\nAppearances indicated that this establishment was a very recent\r\ninstitution. The white letters of the inscription were extremely white\r\nand extremely strong to the sense of smell, the complexion of the\r\ntables and chairs was (like Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s) a little too blooming to\r\nbe believed in, and the carpets and floorcloth seemed to rush at the\r\nbeholder\xe2\x80\x99s face in the unusual prominency of their patterns. But the\r\nTemple, accustomed to tone down both the still life and the human life\r\nthat has much to do with it, would soon get the better of all that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, on one side of the fire, \xe2\x80\x98I feel tolerably\r\ncomfortable. I hope the upholsterer may do the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood, from the other side of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Eugene, reflecting, \xe2\x80\x98he is not in the secret of\r\nour pecuniary affairs, so perhaps he may be in an easy frame of mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall pay him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall we, really?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, indolently surprised. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean to pay him, Eugene, for my part,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, in a slightly\r\ninjured tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I mean to pay him too,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98But then I mean so much\r\nthat I--that I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much that I only mean and shall always only mean and nothing more,\r\nmy dear Mortimer. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend, lying back in his easy chair, watched him lying back in his\r\neasy chair, as he stretched out his legs on the hearth-rug, and said,\r\nwith the amused look that Eugene Wrayburn could always awaken in him\r\nwithout seeming to try or care:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anyhow, your vagaries have increased the bill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Calls the domestic virtues vagaries!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Eugene, raising his\r\neyes to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This very complete little kitchen of ours,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98in which\r\nnothing will ever be cooked--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, dear Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his friend, lazily lifting his head\r\na little to look at him, \xe2\x80\x98how often have I pointed out to you that its\r\nmoral influence is the important thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Its moral influence on this fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Lightwood, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do me the favour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, getting out of his chair with much\r\ngravity, \xe2\x80\x98to come and inspect that feature of our establishment which\r\nyou rashly disparage.\xe2\x80\x99 With that, taking up a candle, he conducted\r\nhis chum into the fourth room of the set of chambers--a little narrow\r\nroom--which was very completely and neatly fitted as a kitchen. \xe2\x80\x98See!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98miniature flour-barrel, rolling-pin, spice-box, shelf of\r\nbrown jars, chopping-board, coffee-mill, dresser elegantly furnished\r\nwith crockery, saucepans and pans, roasting jack, a charming kettle, an\r\narmoury of dish-covers. The moral influence of these objects, in forming\r\nthe domestic virtues, may have an immense influence upon me; not upon\r\nyou, for you are a hopeless case, but upon me. In fact, I have an idea\r\nthat I feel the domestic virtues already forming. Do me the favour to\r\nstep into my bedroom. Secretaire, you see, and abstruse set of solid\r\nmahogany pigeon-holes, one for every letter of the alphabet. To what use\r\ndo I devote them? I receive a bill--say from Jones. I docket it neatly\r\nat the secretaire, JONES, and I put it into pigeonhole J. It\xe2\x80\x99s the next\r\nthing to a receipt and is quite as satisfactory to ME. And I very much\r\nwish, Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 sitting on his bed, with the air of a philosopher\r\nlecturing a disciple, \xe2\x80\x98that my example might induce YOU to cultivate\r\nhabits of punctuality and method; and, by means of the moral influences\r\nwith which I have surrounded you, to encourage the formation of the\r\ndomestic virtues.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer laughed again, with his usual commentaries of \xe2\x80\x98How CAN you be\r\nso ridiculous, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98What an absurd fellow you are!\xe2\x80\x99 but when\r\nhis laugh was out, there was something serious, if not anxious, in his\r\nface. Despite that pernicious assumption of lassitude and indifference,\r\nwhich had become his second nature, he was strongly attached to his\r\nfriend. He had founded himself upon Eugene when they were yet boys at\r\nschool; and at this hour imitated him no less, admired him no less,\r\nloved him no less, than in those departed days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98if I could find you in earnest for a minute, I would\r\ntry to say an earnest word to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An earnest word?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98The moral influences are beginning\r\nto work. Say on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I will,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, \xe2\x80\x98though you are not earnest yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In this desire for earnestness,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Eugene, with the air of one\r\nwho was meditating deeply, \xe2\x80\x98I trace the happy influences of the little\r\nflour-barrel and the coffee-mill. Gratifying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mortimer, disregarding the light interruption, and\r\nlaying a hand upon Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, as he, Mortimer, stood before him\r\nseated on his bed, \xe2\x80\x98you are withholding something from me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene looked at him, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All this past summer, you have been withholding something from me.\r\nBefore we entered on our boating vacation, you were as bent upon it as I\r\nhave seen you upon anything since we first rowed together. But you cared\r\nvery little for it when it came, often found it a tie and a drag upon\r\nyou, and were constantly away. Now it was well enough half-a-dozen\r\ntimes, a dozen times, twenty times, to say to me in your own odd manner,\r\nwhich I know so well and like so much, that your disappearances were\r\nprecautions against our boring one another; but of course after a short\r\nwhile I began to know that they covered something. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask what it\r\nis, as you have not told me; but the fact is so. Say, is it not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I give you my word of honour, Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, after a\r\nserious pause of a few moments, \xe2\x80\x98that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my soul, don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I know less about myself than about most\r\npeople in the world, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have some design in your mind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate, you have some subject of interest there which used not to\r\nbe there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really can\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene, shaking his head blankly, after\r\npausing again to reconsider. \xe2\x80\x98At times I have thought yes; at other\r\ntimes I have thought no. Now, I have been inclined to pursue such a\r\nsubject; now I have felt that it was absurd, and that it tired and\r\nembarrassed me. Absolutely, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. Frankly and faithfully, I would\r\nif I could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo replying, he clapped a hand, in his turn, on his friend\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder,\r\nas he rose from his seat upon the bed, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must take your friend as he is. You know what I am, my dear\r\nMortimer. You know how dreadfully susceptible I am to boredom. You know\r\nthat when I became enough of a man to find myself an embodied conundrum,\r\nI bored myself to the last degree by trying to find out what I meant.\r\nYou know that at length I gave it up, and declined to guess any more.\r\nThen how can I possibly give you the answer that I have not discovered?\r\nThe old nursery form runs, \xe2\x80\x9cRiddle-me-riddle-me-ree, p\xe2\x80\x99raps you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell me what this may be?\xe2\x80\x9d My reply runs, \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Upon my life, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo much of what was fantastically true to his own knowledge of this\r\nutterly careless Eugene, mingled with the answer, that Mortimer could\r\nnot receive it as a mere evasion. Besides, it was given with an engaging\r\nair of openness, and of special exemption of the one friend he valued,\r\nfrom his reckless indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98Let us try the effect of smoking. If it\r\nenlightens me at all on this question, I will impart unreservedly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey returned to the room they had come from, and, finding it heated,\r\nopened a window. Having lighted their cigars, they leaned out of this\r\nwindow, smoking, and looking down at the moonlight, as it shone into the\r\ncourt below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No enlightenment,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Eugene, after certain minutes of silence. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nfeel sincerely apologetic, my dear Mortimer, but nothing comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If nothing comes,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98nothing can come from it. So\r\nI shall hope that this may hold good throughout, and that there may be\r\nnothing on foot. Nothing injurious to you, Eugene, or--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene stayed him for a moment with his hand on his arm, while he took a\r\npiece of earth from an old flowerpot on the window-sill and dexterously\r\nshot it at a little point of light opposite; having done which to his\r\nsatisfaction, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Or?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or injurious to any one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, taking another little piece of earth, and shooting\r\nit with great precision at the former mark, \xe2\x80\x98how injurious to any one\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, taking, as he said the word, another shot, \xe2\x80\x98to whom\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nChecking himself with another piece of earth in his hand, Eugene looked\r\nat his friend inquiringly and a little suspiciously. There was no\r\nconcealed or half-expressed meaning in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two belated wanderers in the mazes of the law,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, attracted\r\nby the sound of footsteps, and glancing down as he spoke, \xe2\x80\x98stray into\r\nthe court. They examine the door-posts of number one, seeking the name\r\nthey want. Not finding it at number one, they come to number two. On the\r\nhat of wanderer number two, the shorter one, I drop this pellet. Hitting\r\nhim on the hat, I smoke serenely, and become absorbed in contemplation\r\nof the sky.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth the wanderers looked up towards the window; but, after\r\ninterchanging a mutter or two, soon applied themselves to the door-posts\r\nbelow. There they seemed to discover what they wanted, for they\r\ndisappeared from view by entering at the doorway. \xe2\x80\x98When they emerge,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98you shall see me bring them both down\xe2\x80\x99; and so prepared\r\ntwo pellets for the purpose.\r\n\r\nHe had not reckoned on their seeking his name, or Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s. But\r\neither the one or the other would seem to be in question, for now there\r\ncame a knock at the door. \xe2\x80\x98I am on duty to-night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98stay\r\nyou where you are, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99 Requiring no persuasion, he stayed there,\r\nsmoking quietly, and not at all curious to know who knocked, until\r\nMortimer spoke to him from within the room, and touched him. Then,\r\ndrawing in his head, he found the visitors to be young Charley Hexam\r\nand the schoolmaster; both standing facing him, and both recognized at a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You recollect this young fellow, Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me look at him,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wrayburn, coolly. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, yes. I\r\nrecollect him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had not been about to repeat that former action of taking him by the\r\nchin, but the boy had suspected him of it, and had thrown up his arm\r\nwith an angry start. Laughingly, Wrayburn looked to Lightwood for an\r\nexplanation of this odd visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says he has something to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely it must be to you, Mortimer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I thought, but he says no. He says it is to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do say so,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the boy. \xe2\x80\x98And I mean to say what I want\r\nto say, too, Mr Eugene Wrayburn!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPassing him with his eyes as if there were nothing where he stood,\r\nEugene looked on to Bradley Headstone. With consummate indolence, he\r\nturned to Mortimer, inquiring: \xe2\x80\x98And who may this other person be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Charles Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley; \xe2\x80\x98I am Charles Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good sir, you should teach your pupils better manners,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nEugene.\r\n\r\nComposedly smoking, he leaned an elbow on the chimneypiece, at the side\r\nof the fire, and looked at the schoolmaster. It was a cruel look, in its\r\ncold disdain of him, as a creature of no worth. The schoolmaster looked\r\nat him, and that, too, was a cruel look, though of the different kind,\r\nthat it had a raging jealousy and fiery wrath in it.\r\n\r\nVery remarkably, neither Eugene Wrayburn nor Bradley Headstone looked at\r\nall at the boy. Through the ensuing dialogue, those two, no matter\r\nwho spoke, or whom was addressed, looked at each other. There was some\r\nsecret, sure perception between them, which set them against one another\r\nin all ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In some high respects, Mr Eugene Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, answering\r\nhim with pale and quivering lips, \xe2\x80\x98the natural feelings of my pupils are\r\nstronger than my teaching.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In most respects, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene, enjoying his cigar,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98though whether high or low is of no importance. You have my name very\r\ncorrectly. Pray what is yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It cannot concern you much to know, but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Eugene, striking sharply and cutting him short at his\r\nmistake, \xe2\x80\x98it does not concern me at all to know. I can say Schoolmaster,\r\nwhich is a most respectable title. You are right, Schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not the dullest part of this goad in its galling of Bradley\r\nHeadstone, that he had made it himself in a moment of incautious anger.\r\nHe tried to set his lips so as to prevent their quivering, but they\r\nquivered fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Eugene Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, \xe2\x80\x98I want a word with you. I have\r\nwanted it so much, that we have looked out your address in the book, and\r\nwe have been to your office, and we have come from your office here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have given yourself much trouble, Schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x99 observed\r\nEugene, blowing the feathery ash from his cigar. \xe2\x80\x98I hope it may prove\r\nremunerative.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I am glad to speak,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the boy, \xe2\x80\x98in presence of Mr Lightwood,\r\nbecause it was through Mr Lightwood that you ever saw my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor a mere moment, Wrayburn turned his eyes aside from the schoolmaster\r\nto note the effect of the last word on Mortimer, who, standing on the\r\nopposite side of the fire, as soon as the word was spoken, turned his\r\nface towards the fire and looked down into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Similarly, it was through Mr Lightwood that you ever saw her again, for\r\nyou were with him on the night when my father was found, and so I found\r\nyou with her on the next day. Since then, you have seen my sister often.\r\nYou have seen my sister oftener and oftener. And I want to know why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was this worth while, Schoolmaster?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Eugene, with the air of\r\na disinterested adviser. \xe2\x80\x98So much trouble for nothing? You should know\r\nbest, but I think not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Mr Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bradley, with his passion rising,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98why you address me--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you? said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98Then I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said it so tauntingly in his perfect placidity, that the respectable\r\nright-hand clutching the respectable hair-guard of the respectable watch\r\ncould have wound it round his throat and strangled him with it. Not\r\nanother word did Eugene deem it worth while to utter, but stood leaning\r\nhis head upon his hand, smoking, and looking imperturbably at the\r\nchafing Bradley Headstone with his clutching right-hand, until Bradley\r\nwas wellnigh mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded the boy, \xe2\x80\x98we not only know this that I have\r\ncharged upon you, but we know more. It has not yet come to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge that we have found it out, but we have. We had a plan, Mr\r\nHeadstone and I, for my sister\xe2\x80\x99s education, and for its being advised\r\nand overlooked by Mr Headstone, who is a much more competent authority,\r\nwhatever you may pretend to think, as you smoke, than you could produce,\r\nif you tried. Then, what do we find? What do we find, Mr Lightwood? Why,\r\nwe find that my sister is already being taught, without our knowing\r\nit. We find that while my sister gives an unwilling and cold ear to our\r\nschemes for her advantage--I, her brother, and Mr Headstone, the most\r\ncompetent authority, as his certificates would easily prove, that could\r\nbe produced--she is wilfully and willingly profiting by other schemes.\r\nAy, and taking pains, too, for I know what such pains are. And so does\r\nMr Headstone! Well! Somebody pays for this, is a thought that naturally\r\noccurs to us; who pays? We apply ourselves to find out, Mr Lightwood,\r\nand we find that your friend, this Mr Eugene Wrayburn, here, pays. Then\r\nI ask him what right has he to do it, and what does he mean by it, and\r\nhow comes he to be taking such a liberty without my consent, when I\r\nam raising myself in the scale of society by my own exertions and Mr\r\nHeadstone\xe2\x80\x99s aid, and have no right to have any darkness cast upon my\r\nprospects, or any imputation upon my respectability, through my sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boyish weakness of this speech, combined with its great selfishness,\r\nmade it a poor one indeed. And yet Bradley Headstone, used to the little\r\naudience of a school, and unused to the larger ways of men, showed a\r\nkind of exultation in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I tell Mr Eugene Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the boy, forced into the use\r\nof the third person by the hopelessness of addressing him in the first,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I object to his having any acquaintance at all with my sister, and\r\nthat I request him to drop it altogether. He is not to take it into his\r\nhead that I am afraid of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s caring for HIM--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(As the boy sneered, the Master sneered, and Eugene blew off the\r\nfeathery ash again.)\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x98But I object to it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. I am more important to my\r\nsister than he thinks. As I raise myself, I intend to raise her;\r\nshe knows that, and she has to look to me for her prospects. Now I\r\nunderstand all this very well, and so does Mr Headstone. My sister is an\r\nexcellent girl, but she has some romantic notions; not about such things\r\nas your Mr Eugene Wrayburns, but about the death of my father and other\r\nmatters of that sort. Mr Wrayburn encourages those notions to make\r\nhimself of importance, and so she thinks she ought to be grateful to\r\nhim, and perhaps even likes to be. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose her to be grateful\r\nto him, or to be grateful to anybody but me, except Mr Headstone. And\r\nI tell Mr Wrayburn that if he don\xe2\x80\x99t take heed of what I say, it will be\r\nworse for her. Let him turn that over in his memory, and make sure of\r\nit. Worse for her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, in which the schoolmaster looked very awkward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I suggest, Schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, removing his fast-waning\r\ncigar from his lips to glance at it, \xe2\x80\x98that you can now take your pupil\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Mr Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 added the boy, with a burning face, under the\r\nflaming aggravation of getting no sort of answer or attention, \xe2\x80\x98I hope\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll take notice of what I have said to your friend, and of what\r\nyour friend has heard me say, word by word, whatever he pretends to the\r\ncontrary. You are bound to take notice of it, Mr Lightwood, for, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, you first brought your friend into my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany, and but for you we never should have seen him. Lord knows none\r\nof us ever wanted him, any more than any of us will ever miss him. Now\r\nMr Headstone, as Mr Eugene Wrayburn has been obliged to hear what I had\r\nto say, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help himself, and as I have said it out to the last\r\nword, we have done all we wanted to do, and may go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go down-stairs, and leave me a moment, Hexam,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned. The boy\r\ncomplying with an indignant look and as much noise as he could make,\r\nswung out of the room; and Lightwood went to the window, and leaned\r\nthere, looking out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think me of no more value than the dirt under your feet,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBradley to Eugene, speaking in a carefully weighed and measured tone, or\r\nhe could not have spoken at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, Schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other; \xe2\x80\x98you know better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s coarse,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene retorted; \xe2\x80\x98but you DON\xe2\x80\x99T know better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn, at least I know very well that it would be idle to set\r\nmyself against you in insolent words or overbearing manners. That lad\r\nwho has just gone out could put you to shame in half-a-dozen branches of\r\nknowledge in half an hour, but you can throw him aside like an inferior.\r\nYou can do as much by me, I have no doubt, beforehand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possibly,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am more than a lad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, with his clutching hand, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nI WILL be heard, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98you are always being heard. That\r\nought to content you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it does not content me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the other, white with passion. \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\nyou suppose that a man, in forming himself for the duties I discharge,\r\nand in watching and repressing himself daily to discharge them well,\r\ndismisses a man\xe2\x80\x99s nature?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98judging from what I see as I look at you,\r\nto be rather too passionate for a good schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99 As he spoke, he\r\ntossed away the end of his cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Passionate with you, sir, I admit I am. Passionate with you, sir, I\r\nrespect myself for being. But I have not Devils for my pupils.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For your Teachers, I should rather say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, my name is Bradley Headstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you justly said, my good sir, your name cannot concern me. Now, what\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This more. Oh, what a misfortune is mine,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bradley, breaking off\r\nto wipe the starting perspiration from his face as he shook from head to\r\nfoot, \xe2\x80\x98that I cannot so control myself as to appear a stronger creature\r\nthan this, when a man who has not felt in all his life what I have felt\r\nin a day can so command himself!\xe2\x80\x99 He said it in a very agony, and even\r\nfollowed it with an errant motion of his hands as if he could have torn\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nEugene Wrayburn looked on at him, as if he found him beginning to be\r\nrather an entertaining study.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn, I desire to say something to you on my own part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, Schoolmaster,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, with a languid approach to\r\nimpatience as the other again struggled with himself; \xe2\x80\x98say what you have\r\nto say. And let me remind you that the door is standing open, and your\r\nyoung friend waiting for you on the stairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I accompanied that youth here, sir, I did so with the purpose of\r\nadding, as a man whom you should not be permitted to put aside, in case\r\nyou put him aside as a boy, that his instinct is correct and right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThus Bradley Headstone, with great effort and difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that all?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other, flushed and fierce. \xe2\x80\x98I strongly support him\r\nin his disapproval of your visits to his sister, and in his objection to\r\nyour officiousness--and worse--in what you have taken upon yourself to\r\ndo for her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is THAT all?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir. I determined to tell you that you are not justified in these\r\nproceedings, and that they are injurious to his sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you her schoolmaster as well as her brother\xe2\x80\x99s?--Or perhaps you\r\nwould like to be?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\nIt was a stab that the blood followed, in its rush to Bradley\r\nHeadstone\xe2\x80\x99s face, as swiftly as if it had been dealt with a dagger.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x99 was as much as he could utter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A natural ambition enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, coolly. \xe2\x80\x98Far be it from me\r\nto say otherwise. The sister who is something too much upon your lips,\r\nperhaps--is so very different from all the associations to which she had\r\nbeen used, and from all the low obscure people about her, that it is a\r\nvery natural ambition.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you throw my obscurity in my teeth, Mr Wrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That can hardly be, for I know nothing concerning it, Schoolmaster, and\r\nseek to know nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You reproach me with my origin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone; \xe2\x80\x98you cast\r\ninsinuations at my bringing-up. But I tell you, sir, I have worked my\r\nway onward, out of both and in spite of both, and have a right to be\r\nconsidered a better man than you, with better reasons for being proud.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I can reproach you with what is not within my knowledge, or how\r\nI can cast stones that were never in my hand, is a problem for the\r\ningenuity of a schoolmaster to prove,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98Is THAT all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir. If you suppose that boy--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who really will be tired of waiting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you suppose that boy to be friendless, Mr Wrayburn, you deceive\r\nyourself. I am his friend, and you shall find me so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you will find HIM on the stairs,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may have promised yourself, sir, that you could do what you\r\nchose here, because you had to deal with a mere boy, inexperienced,\r\nfriendless, and unassisted. But I give you warning that this mean\r\ncalculation is wrong. You have to do with a man also. You have to do\r\nwith me. I will support him, and, if need be, require reparation for\r\nhim. My hand and heart are in this cause, and are open to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And--quite a coincidence--the door is open,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I scorn your shifty evasions, and I scorn you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the schoolmaster.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the meanness of your nature you revile me with the meanness of my\r\nbirth. I hold you in contempt for it. But if you don\xe2\x80\x99t profit by this\r\nvisit, and act accordingly, you will find me as bitterly in earnest\r\nagainst you as I could be if I deemed you worth a second thought on my\r\nown account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a consciously bad grace and stiff manner, as Wrayburn looked so\r\neasily and calmly on, he went out with these words, and the heavy door\r\nclosed like a furnace-door upon his red and white heats of rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A curious monomaniac,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98The man seems to believe that\r\neverybody was acquainted with his mother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer Lightwood being still at the window, to which he had in\r\ndelicacy withdrawn, Eugene called to him, and he fell to slowly pacing\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, as he lighted another cigar, \xe2\x80\x98I fear my\r\nunexpected visitors have been troublesome. If as a set-off (excuse the\r\nlegal phrase from a barrister-at-law) you would like to ask Tippins to\r\ntea, I pledge myself to make love to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, Eugene, Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mortimer, still pacing the room, \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nsorry for this. And to think that I have been so blind!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How blind, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired his unmoved friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What were your words that night at the river-side public-house?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLightwood, stopping. \xe2\x80\x98What was it that you asked me? Did I feel like a\r\ndark combination of traitor and pickpocket when I thought of that girl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I seem to remember the expression,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do YOU feel when you think of her just now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend made no direct reply, but observed, after a few whiffs of his\r\ncigar, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake the situation. There is no better girl in all this\r\nLondon than Lizzie Hexam. There is no better among my people at home; no\r\nbetter among your people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Granted. What follows?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, looking after him dubiously as he paced away to\r\nthe other end of the room, \xe2\x80\x98you put me again upon guessing the riddle\r\nthat I have given up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, do you design to capture and desert this girl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow, no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you design to marry her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow, no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you design to pursue her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow, I don\xe2\x80\x99t design anything. I have no design whatever.\r\nI am incapable of designs. If I conceived a design, I should speedily\r\nabandon it, exhausted by the operation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh Eugene, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mortimer, not that tone of melancholy reproach, I entreat. What\r\ncan I do more than tell you all I know, and acknowledge my ignorance\r\nof all I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! How does that little old song go, which, under\r\npretence of being cheerful, is by far the most lugubrious I ever heard\r\nin my life?\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAway with melancholy,\r\n     Nor doleful changes ring\r\n     On life and human folly,\r\n     But merrily merrily sing\r\n                              Fal la!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us sing Fal la, my dear Mortimer (which is comparatively\r\nunmeaning), but let us sing that we give up guessing the riddle\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you in communication with this girl, Eugene, and is what these\r\npeople say true?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I concede both admissions to my honourable and learned friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what is to come of it? What are you doing? Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mortimer, one would think the schoolmaster had left behind him\r\na catechizing infection. You are ruffled by the want of another cigar.\r\nTake one of these, I entreat. Light it at mine, which is in perfect\r\norder. So! Now do me the justice to observe that I am doing all I can\r\ntowards self-improvement, and that you have a light thrown on those\r\nhousehold implements which, when you only saw them as in a glass darkly,\r\nyou were hastily--I must say hastily--inclined to depreciate. Sensible\r\nof my deficiencies, I have surrounded myself with moral influences\r\nexpressly meant to promote the formation of the domestic virtues.\r\nTo those influences, and to the improving society of my friend from\r\nboyhood, commend me with your best wishes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, affectionately, now standing near him,\r\nso that they both stood in one little cloud of smoke; \xe2\x80\x98I would that you\r\nanswered my three questions! What is to come of it? What are you doing?\r\nWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And my dear Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, lightly fanning away the smoke\r\nwith his hand for the better exposition of his frankness of face and\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98believe me, I would answer them instantly if I could. But\r\nto enable me to do so, I must first have found out the troublesome\r\nconundrum long abandoned. Here it is. Eugene Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99 Tapping his\r\nforehead and breast. \xe2\x80\x98Riddle-me, riddle-me-ree, perhaps you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme what this may be?--No, upon my life I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I give it up!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nIN WHICH A FRIENDLY MOVE IS ORIGINATED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangement between Mr Boffin and his literary man, Mr Silas Wegg,\r\nso far altered with the altered habits of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s life, as that\r\nthe Roman Empire usually declined in the morning and in the eminently\r\naristocratic family mansion, rather than in the evening, as of yore,\r\nand in Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower. There were occasions, however, when Mr Boffin,\r\nseeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion, would present\r\nhimself at the Bower after dark, to anticipate the next sallying\r\nforth of Wegg, and would there, on the old settle, pursue the downward\r\nfortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were\r\nby this time on their last legs. If Wegg had been worse paid for his\r\noffice, or better qualified to discharge it, he would have considered\r\nthese visits complimentary and agreeable; but, holding the position of\r\na handsomely-remunerated humbug, he resented them. This was quite\r\naccording to rule, for the incompetent servant, by whomsoever employed,\r\nis always against his employer. Even those born governors, noble and\r\nright honourable creatures, who have been the most imbecile in high\r\nplaces, have uniformly shown themselves the most opposed (sometimes in\r\nbelying distrust, sometimes in vapid insolence) to THEIR employer. What\r\nis in such wise true of the public master and servant, is equally true\r\nof the private master and servant all the world over.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Silas Wegg did at last obtain free access to \xe2\x80\x98Our House\xe2\x80\x99, as he\r\nhad been wont to call the mansion outside which he had sat shelterless\r\nso long, and when he did at last find it in all particulars as different\r\nfrom his mental plans of it as according to the nature of things it\r\nwell could be, that far-seeing and far-reaching character, by way of\r\nasserting himself and making out a case for compensation, affected to\r\nfall into a melancholy strain of musing over the mournful past; as if\r\nthe house and he had had a fall in life together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Silas would say to his patron, sadly nodding his head\r\nand musing, \xe2\x80\x98was once Our House! This, sir, is the building from which I\r\nhave so often seen those great creatures, Miss Elizabeth, Master\r\nGeorge, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker\xe2\x80\x99--whose very names were of his own\r\ninventing--\xe2\x80\x98pass and repass! And has it come to this, indeed! Ah dear\r\nme, dear me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo tender were his lamentations, that the kindly Mr Boffin was quite\r\nsorry for him, and almost felt mistrustful that in buying the house he\r\nhad done him an irreparable injury.\r\n\r\nTwo or three diplomatic interviews, the result of great subtlety on Mr\r\nWegg\xe2\x80\x99s part, but assuming the mask of careless yielding to a fortuitous\r\ncombination of circumstances impelling him towards Clerkenwell, had\r\nenabled him to complete his bargain with Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bring me round to the Bower,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas, when the bargain was closed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98next Saturday evening, and if a sociable glass of old Jamaikey warm\r\nshould meet your views, I am not the man to begrudge it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are aware of my being poor company, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Venus, \xe2\x80\x98but be\r\nit so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt being so, here is Saturday evening come, and here is Mr Venus come,\r\nand ringing at the Bower-gate.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg opens the gate, descries a sort of brown paper truncheon under\r\nMr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and remarks, in a dry tone: \xe2\x80\x98Oh! I thought perhaps you\r\nmight have come in a cab.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Venus. \xe2\x80\x98I am not above a parcel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Above a parcel! No!\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg, with some dissatisfaction. But does not\r\nopenly growl, \xe2\x80\x98a certain sort of parcel might be above you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is your purchase, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 says Venus, politely handing it over,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and I am glad to restore it to the source from whence it--flowed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Now this affair is concluded, I may mention to\r\nyou in a friendly way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve my doubts whether, if I had consulted a\r\nlawyer, you could have kept this article back from me. I only throw it\r\nout as a legal point.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so, Mr Wegg? I bought you in open contract.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t buy human flesh and blood in this country, sir; not alive,\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98Then query, bone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a legal point?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a legal point.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not competent to speak upon that, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 says Venus, reddening\r\nand growing something louder; \xe2\x80\x98but upon a point of fact I think myself\r\ncompetent to speak; and as a point of fact I would have seen you--will\r\nyou allow me to say, further?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say more than further, if I was you,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg suggests,\r\npacifically.\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x98Before I\xe2\x80\x99d have given that packet into your hand without being paid\r\nmy price for it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know how the point of law may stand,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m thoroughly confident upon the point of fact.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr Venus is irritable (no doubt owing to his disappointment in love),\r\nand as it is not the cue of Mr Wegg to have him out of temper, the\r\nlatter gentleman soothingly remarks, \xe2\x80\x98I only put it as a little case; I\r\nonly put it ha\xe2\x80\x99porthetically.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99d rather, Mr Wegg, you put it another time, penn\xe2\x80\x99orth-etically,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nis Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s retort, \xe2\x80\x98for I tell you candidly I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your little\r\ncases.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nArrived by this time in Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, made bright on the\r\nchilly evening by gaslight and fire, Mr Venus softens and compliments\r\nhim on his abode; profiting by the occasion to remind Wegg that he\r\n(Venus) told him he had got into a good thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tolerable,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg rejoins. \xe2\x80\x98But bear in mind, Mr Venus, that there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno gold without its alloy. Mix for yourself and take a seat in the\r\nchimbley-corner. Will you perform upon a pipe, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am but an indifferent performer, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returns the other; \xe2\x80\x98but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\naccompany you with a whiff or two at intervals.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, Mr Venus mixes, and Wegg mixes; and Mr Venus lights and puffs, and\r\nWegg lights and puffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there\xe2\x80\x99s alloy even in this metal of yours, Mr Wegg, you was\r\nremarking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mystery,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, Mr Venus. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to\r\nhave the life knocked out of former inhabitants of this house, in the\r\ngloomy dark, and not know who did it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might you have any suspicions, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 returns that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I know who profits by it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nsuspicions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving said which, Mr Wegg smokes and looks at the fire with a most\r\ndetermined expression of Charity; as if he had caught that cardinal\r\nvirtue by the skirts as she felt it her painful duty to depart from him,\r\nand held her by main force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Similarly,\xe2\x80\x99 resumes Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98I have observations as I can offer upon\r\ncertain points and parties; but I make no objections, Mr Venus. Here\r\nis an immense fortune drops from the clouds upon a person that shall be\r\nnameless. Here is a weekly allowance, with a certain weight of coals,\r\ndrops from the clouds upon me. Which of us is the better man? Not the\r\nperson that shall be nameless. That\xe2\x80\x99s an observation of mine, but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t make it an objection. I take my allowance and my certain weight of\r\ncoals. He takes his fortune. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it works.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be a good thing for me, if I could see things in the calm\r\nlight you do, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again look here,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues Silas, with an oratorical flourish of his\r\npipe and his wooden leg: the latter having an undignified tendency\r\nto tilt him back in his chair; \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s another observation, Mr Venus,\r\nunaccompanied with an objection. Him that shall be nameless is liable to\r\nbe talked over. He gets talked over. Him that shall be nameless, having\r\nme at his right hand, naturally looking to be promoted higher, and you\r\nmay perhaps say meriting to be promoted higher--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Mr Venus murmurs that he does say so.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Him that shall be nameless, under such circumstances passes me by,\r\nand puts a talking-over stranger above my head. Which of us two is the\r\nbetter man? Which of us two can repeat most poetry? Which of us two has,\r\nin the service of him that shall be nameless, tackled the Romans, both\r\ncivil and military, till he has got as husky as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been weaned and\r\never since brought up on sawdust? Not the talking-over stranger. Yet the\r\nhouse is as free to him as if it was his, and he has his room, and is\r\nput upon a footing, and draws about a thousand a year. I am banished to\r\nthe Bower, to be found in it like a piece of furniture whenever wanted.\r\nMerit, therefore, don\xe2\x80\x99t win. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it works. I observe it,\r\nbecause I can\xe2\x80\x99t help observing it, being accustomed to take a powerful\r\nsight of notice; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t object. Ever here before, Mr Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not inside the gate, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve been as far as the gate then, Mr Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr Wegg, and peeped in from curiosity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but the dust-yard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg rolls his eyes all round the room, in that ever unsatisfied\r\nquest of his, and then rolls his eyes all round Mr Venus; as if\r\nsuspicious of his having something about him to be found out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursues, \xe2\x80\x98being acquainted with old Mr Harmon, one\r\nwould have thought it might have been polite in you, too, to give him a\r\ncall. And you\xe2\x80\x99re naturally of a polite disposition, you are.\xe2\x80\x99 This last\r\nclause as a softening compliment to Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is true, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Venus, winking his weak eyes, and running\r\nhis fingers through his dusty shock of hair, \xe2\x80\x98that I was so, before a\r\ncertain observation soured me. You understand to what I allude, Mr Wegg?\r\nTo a certain written statement respecting not wishing to be regarded in\r\na certain light. Since that, all is fled, save gall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not all,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Wegg, in a tone of sentimental condolence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Venus, \xe2\x80\x98all! The world may deem it harsh, but I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nquite as soon pitch into my best friend as not. Indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily making a pass with his wooden leg to guard himself as Mr\r\nVenus springs up in the emphasis of this unsociable declaration, Mr Wegg\r\ntilts over on his back, chair and all, and is rescued by that harmless\r\nmisanthrope, in a disjointed state and ruefully rubbing his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you lost your balance, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 says Venus, handing him his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And about time to do it,\xe2\x80\x99 grumbles Silas, \xe2\x80\x98when a man\xe2\x80\x99s visitors,\r\nwithout a word of notice, conduct themselves with the sudden wiciousness\r\nof Jacks-in-boxes! Don\xe2\x80\x99t come flying out of your chair like that, Mr\r\nVenus!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ask your pardon, Mr Wegg. I am so soured.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but hang it,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg argumentatively, \xe2\x80\x98a well-governed mind can\r\nbe soured sitting! And as to being regarded in lights, there\xe2\x80\x99s bumpey\r\nlights as well as bony. IN which,\xe2\x80\x99 again rubbing his head, \xe2\x80\x98I object to\r\nregard myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear it in memory, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg slowly subdues his ironical tone and his\r\nlingering irritation, and resumes his pipe. \xe2\x80\x98We were talking of old Mr\r\nHarmon being a friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a friend, Mr Wegg. Only known to speak to, and to have a little\r\ndeal with now and then. A very inquisitive character, Mr Wegg, regarding\r\nwhat was found in the dust. As inquisitive as secret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! You found him secret?\xe2\x80\x99 returns Wegg, with a greedy relish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He had always the look of it, and the manner of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 with another roll of his eyes. \xe2\x80\x98As to what was found in the dust\r\nnow. Did you ever hear him mention how he found it, my dear friend?\r\nLiving on the mysterious premises, one would like to know. For instance,\r\nwhere he found things? Or, for instance, how he set about it? Whether\r\nhe began at the top of the mounds, or whether he began at the bottom.\r\nWhether he prodded\xe2\x80\x99; Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s pantomime is skilful and expressive here;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98or whether he scooped? Should you say scooped, my dear Mr Venus; or\r\nshould you as a man--say prodded?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should say neither, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a fellow-man, Mr Venus--mix again--why neither?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I suppose, sir, that what was found, was found in the sorting\r\nand sifting. All the mounds are sorted and sifted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall see \xe2\x80\x98em and pass your opinion. Mix again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn each occasion of his saying \xe2\x80\x98mix again\xe2\x80\x99, Mr Wegg, with a hop on\r\nhis wooden leg, hitches his chair a little nearer; more as if he were\r\nproposing that himself and Mr Venus should mix again, than that they\r\nshould replenish their glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Living (as I said before) on the mysterious premises,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg when\r\nthe other has acted on his hospitable entreaty, \xe2\x80\x98one likes to know.\r\nWould you be inclined to say now--as a brother--that he ever hid things\r\nin the dust, as well as found \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg, on the whole I should say he might.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg claps on his spectacles, and admiringly surveys Mr Venus from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a mortal equally with myself, whose hand I take in mine for the\r\nfirst time this day, having unaccountably overlooked that act so full of\r\nboundless confidence binding a fellow-creetur TO a fellow creetur,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nWegg, holding Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s palm out, flat and ready for smiting, and now\r\nsmiting it; \xe2\x80\x98as such--and no other--for I scorn all lowlier ties betwixt\r\nmyself and the man walking with his face erect that alone I call my\r\nTwin--regarded and regarding in this trustful bond--what do you think he\r\nmight have hid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is but a supposition, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a Being with his hand upon his heart,\xe2\x80\x99 cries Wegg; and the\r\napostrophe is not the less impressive for the Being\xe2\x80\x99s hand being\r\nactually upon his rum and water; \xe2\x80\x98put your supposition into language,\r\nand bring it out, Mr Venus!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was the species of old gentleman, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 slowly returns that\r\npractical anatomist, after drinking, \xe2\x80\x98that I should judge likely to\r\ntake such opportunities as this place offered, of stowing away money,\r\nvaluables, maybe papers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As one that was ever an ornament to human life,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Wegg, again\r\nholding out Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s palm as if he were going to tell his fortune by\r\nchiromancy, and holding his own up ready for smiting it when the time\r\nshould come; \xe2\x80\x98as one that the poet might have had his eye on, in writing\r\nthe national naval words:\r\n\r\n     Helm a-weather, now lay her close,\r\n            Yard arm and yard arm she lies;\r\n     Again, cried I, Mr Venus, give her t\xe2\x80\x99other dose,\r\n            Man shrouds and grapple, sir, or she flies!\r\n\r\n--that is to say, regarded in the light of true British Oak, for such\r\nyou are explain, Mr Venus, the expression \xe2\x80\x9cpapers\xe2\x80\x9d!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seeing that the old gentleman was generally cutting off some near\r\nrelation, or blocking out some natural affection,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Venus rejoins, \xe2\x80\x98he\r\nmost likely made a good many wills and codicils.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe palm of Silas Wegg descends with a sounding smack upon the palm\r\nof Venus, and Wegg lavishly exclaims, \xe2\x80\x98Twin in opinion equally with\r\nfeeling! Mix a little more!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving now hitched his wooden leg and his chair close in front of Mr\r\nVenus, Mr Wegg rapidly mixes for both, gives his visitor his glass,\r\ntouches its rim with the rim of his own, puts his own to his lips, puts\r\nit down, and spreading his hands on his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s knees thus addresses\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Venus. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that I object to being passed over for a stranger,\r\nthough I regard the stranger as a more than doubtful customer. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor the sake of making money, though money is ever welcome. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t for\r\nmyself, though I am not so haughty as to be above doing myself a good\r\nturn. It\xe2\x80\x99s for the cause of the right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus, passively winking his weak eyes both at once, demands: \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nis, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The friendly move, sir, that I now propose. You see the move, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Till you have pointed it out, Mr Wegg, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether I do or\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If there IS anything to be found on these premises, let us find it\r\ntogether. Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to look for it\r\ntogether. Let us make the friendly move of agreeing to share the\r\nprofits of it equally betwixt us. In the cause of the right.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus Silas\r\nassuming a noble air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Venus, looking up, after meditating with his hair held\r\nin his hands, as if he could only fix his attention by fixing his head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if anything was to be unburied from under the dust, it would be kept a\r\nsecret by you and me? Would that be it, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would depend upon what it was, Mr Venus. Say it was money, or\r\nplate, or jewellery, it would be as much ours as anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus rubs an eyebrow, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the cause of the right it would. Because it would be unknowingly\r\nsold with the mounds else, and the buyer would get what he was never\r\nmeant to have, and never bought. And what would that be, Mr Venus, but\r\nthe cause of the wrong?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say it was papers,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Venus propounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98According to what they contained we should offer to dispose of \xe2\x80\x98em to\r\nthe parties most interested,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Wegg, promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the cause of the right, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always so, Mr Venus. If the parties should use them in the cause of the\r\nwrong, that would be their act and deed. Mr Venus. I have an opinion of\r\nyou, sir, to which it is not easy to give mouth. Since I called upon you\r\nthat evening when you were, as I may say, floating your powerful mind in\r\ntea, I have felt that you required to be roused with an object. In this\r\nfriendly move, sir, you will have a glorious object to rouse you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg then goes on to enlarge upon what throughout has been uppermost\r\nin his crafty mind:--the qualifications of Mr Venus for such a search.\r\nHe expatiates on Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s patient habits and delicate manipulation; on\r\nhis skill in piecing little things together; on his knowledge of various\r\ntissues and textures; on the likelihood of small indications leading him\r\non to the discovery of great concealments. \xe2\x80\x98While as to myself,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nWegg, \xe2\x80\x98I am not good at it. Whether I gave myself up to prodding,\r\nor whether I gave myself up to scooping, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it with that\r\ndelicate touch so as not to show that I was disturbing the mounds.\r\nQuite different with YOU, going to work (as YOU would) in the light of\r\na fellow-man, holily pledged in a friendly move to his brother man.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr\r\nWegg next modestly remarks on the want of adaptation in a wooden leg\r\nto ladders and such like airy perches, and also hints at an inherent\r\ntendency in that timber fiction, when called into action for the\r\npurposes of a promenade on an ashey slope, to stick itself into the\r\nyielding foothold, and peg its owner to one spot. Then, leaving this\r\npart of the subject, he remarks on the special phenomenon that before\r\nhis installation in the Bower, it was from Mr Venus that he first heard\r\nof the legend of hidden wealth in the Mounds: \xe2\x80\x98which\xe2\x80\x99, he observes with\r\na vaguely pious air, \xe2\x80\x98was surely never meant for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 Lastly,\r\nhe returns to the cause of the right, gloomily foreshadowing the\r\npossibility of something being unearthed to criminate Mr Boffin (of whom\r\nhe once more candidly admits it cannot be denied that he profits by a\r\nmurder), and anticipating his denunciation by the friendly movers to\r\navenging justice. And this, Mr Wegg expressly points out, not at all for\r\nthe sake of the reward--though it would be a want of principle not to\r\ntake it.\r\n\r\nTo all this, Mr Venus, with his shock of dusty hair cocked after the\r\nmanner of a terrier\xe2\x80\x99s ears, attends profoundly. When Mr Wegg, having\r\nfinished, opens his arms wide, as if to show Mr Venus how bare his\r\nbreast is, and then folds them pending a reply, Mr Venus winks at him\r\nwith both eyes some little time before speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see you have tried it by yourself, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 he says when he does\r\nspeak. \xe2\x80\x98You have found out the difficulties by experience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it can hardly be said that I have tried it,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Wegg, a little\r\ndashed by the hint. \xe2\x80\x98I have just skimmed it. Skimmed it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And found nothing besides the difficulties?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg shakes his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I scarcely know what to say to this, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 observes Venus, after\r\nruminating for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say yes,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg naturally urges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t soured, my answer would be no. But being soured, Mr Wegg,\r\nand driven to reckless madness and desperation, I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg joyfully reproduces the two glasses, repeats the ceremony of\r\nclinking their rims, and inwardly drinks with great heartiness to the\r\nhealth and success in life of the young lady who has reduced Mr Venus to\r\nhis present convenient state of mind.\r\n\r\nThe articles of the friendly move are then severally recited and agreed\r\nupon. They are but secrecy, fidelity, and perseverance. The Bower to\r\nbe always free of access to Mr Venus for his researches, and every\r\nprecaution to be taken against their attracting observation in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a footstep!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaims Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 cries Wegg, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Outside. St!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey are in the act of ratifying the treaty of friendly move, by shaking\r\nhands upon it. They softly break off, light their pipes which have gone\r\nout, and lean back in their chairs. No doubt, a footstep. It approaches\r\nthe window, and a hand taps at the glass. \xe2\x80\x98Come in!\xe2\x80\x99 calls Wegg; meaning\r\ncome round by the door. But the heavy old-fashioned sash is slowly\r\nraised, and a head slowly looks in out of the dark background of night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray is Mr Silas Wegg here? Oh! I see him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe friendly movers might not have been quite at their ease, even\r\nthough the visitor had entered in the usual manner. But, leaning on the\r\nbreast-high window, and staring in out of the darkness, they find the\r\nvisitor extremely embarrassing. Especially Mr Venus: who removes his\r\npipe, draws back his head, and stares at the starer, as if it were his\r\nown Hindoo baby come to fetch him home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, Mr Wegg. The yard gate-lock should be looked to, if you\r\nplease; it don\xe2\x80\x99t catch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 falters Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is Mr Rokesmith. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me disturb you. I am not coming in. I\r\nhave only a message for you, which I undertook to deliver on my way home\r\nto my lodgings. I was in two minds about coming beyond the gate without\r\nringing: not knowing but you might have a dog about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I had,\xe2\x80\x99 mutters Wegg, with his back turned as he rose from his\r\nchair. \xe2\x80\x98St! Hush! The talking-over stranger, Mr Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that any one I know?\xe2\x80\x99 inquires the staring Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Mr Rokesmith. Friend of mine. Passing the evening with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I beg his pardon. Mr Boffin wishes you to know that he does not\r\nexpect you to stay at home any evening, on the chance of his coming. It\r\nhas occurred to him that he may, without intending it, have been a tie\r\nupon you. In future, if he should come without notice, he will take his\r\nchance of finding you, and it will be all the same to him if he does\r\nnot. I undertook to tell you on my way. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that, and \xe2\x80\x98Good night,\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary lowers the window, and\r\ndisappears. They listen, and hear his footsteps go back to the gate, and\r\nhear the gate close after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And for that individual, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 remarks Wegg, when he is fully\r\ngone, \xe2\x80\x98I have been passed over! Let me ask you what you think of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nApparently, Mr Venus does not know what to think of him, for he makes\r\nsundry efforts to reply, without delivering himself of any other\r\narticulate utterance than that he has \xe2\x80\x98a singular look\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A double look, you mean, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoins Wegg, playing bitterly upon the\r\nword. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s HIS look. Any amount of singular look for me, but not a\r\ndouble look! That\xe2\x80\x99s an under-handed mind, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you say there\xe2\x80\x99s something against him?\xe2\x80\x99 Venus asks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something against him?\xe2\x80\x99 repeats Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Something? What would the relief\r\nbe to my feelings--as a fellow-man--if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the slave of truth, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t feel myself compelled to answer, Everything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSee into what wonderful maudlin refuges, featherless ostriches plunge\r\ntheir heads! It is such unspeakable moral compensation to Wegg, to be\r\novercome by the consideration that Mr Rokesmith has an underhanded mind!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On this starlight night, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarks, when he is showing that\r\nfriendly mover out across the yard, and both are something the worse\r\nfor mixing again and again: \xe2\x80\x98on this starlight night to think that\r\ntalking-over strangers, and underhanded minds, can go walking home under\r\nthe sky, as if they was all square!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The spectacle of those orbs,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mr Venus, gazing upward with his hat\r\ntumbling off; \xe2\x80\x98brings heavy on me her crushing words that she did not\r\nwish to regard herself nor yet to be regarded in that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know! I know! You needn\xe2\x80\x99t repeat \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 says Wegg, pressing his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But think how those stars steady me in the cause of the right against\r\nsome that shall be nameless. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t that I bear malice. But see how\r\nthey glisten with old remembrances! Old remembrances of what, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus begins drearily replying, \xe2\x80\x98Of her words, in her own\r\nhandwriting, that she does not wish to regard herself, nor yet--\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\nSilas cuts him short with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir! Remembrances of Our House, of Master George, of Aunt Jane, of\r\nUncle Parker, all laid waste! All offered up sacrifices to the minion of\r\nfortune and the worm of the hour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nIN WHICH AN INNOCENT ELOPEMENT OCCURS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minion of fortune and the worm of the hour, or in less cutting\r\nlanguage, Nicodemus Boffin, Esquire, the Golden Dustman, had become\r\nas much at home in his eminently aristocratic family mansion as he\r\nwas likely ever to be. He could not but feel that, like an eminently\r\naristocratic family cheese, it was much too large for his wants, and\r\nbred an infinite amount of parasites; but he was content to regard this\r\ndrawback on his property as a sort of perpetual Legacy Duty. He felt the\r\nmore resigned to it, forasmuch as Mrs Boffin enjoyed herself completely,\r\nand Miss Bella was delighted.\r\n\r\nThat young lady was, no doubt, an acquisition to the Boffins. She\r\nwas far too pretty to be unattractive anywhere, and far too quick of\r\nperception to be below the tone of her new career. Whether it improved\r\nher heart might be a matter of taste that was open to question; but as\r\ntouching another matter of taste, its improvement of her appearance and\r\nmanner, there could be no question whatever.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it soon came about that Miss Bella began to set Mrs Boffin\r\nright; and even further, that Miss Bella began to feel ill at ease, and\r\nas it were responsible, when she saw Mrs Boffin going wrong. Not that so\r\nsweet a disposition and so sound a nature could ever go very wrong even\r\namong the great visiting authorities who agreed that the Boffins were\r\n\xe2\x80\x98charmingly vulgar\xe2\x80\x99 (which for certain was not their own case in saying\r\nso), but that when she made a slip on the social ice on which all the\r\nchildren of Podsnappery, with genteel souls to be saved, are required to\r\nskate in circles, or to slide in long rows, she inevitably tripped Miss\r\nBella up (so that young lady felt), and caused her to experience great\r\nconfusion under the glances of the more skilful performers engaged in\r\nthose ice-exercises.\r\n\r\nAt Miss Bella\xe2\x80\x99s time of life it was not to be expected that she should\r\nexamine herself very closely on the congruity or stability of her\r\nposition in Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house. And as she had never been sparing of\r\ncomplaints of her old home when she had no other to compare it with,\r\nso there was no novelty of ingratitude or disdain in her very much\r\npreferring her new one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An invaluable man is Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, after some two or\r\nthree months. \xe2\x80\x98But I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite make him out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNeither could Bella, so she found the subject rather interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He takes more care of my affairs, morning, noon, and night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin, \xe2\x80\x98than fifty other men put together either could or would; and\r\nyet he has ways of his own that are like tying a scaffolding-pole right\r\nacross the road, and bringing me up short when I am almost a-walking arm\r\nin arm with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask how so, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98he won\xe2\x80\x99t meet any company here, but\r\nyou. When we have visitors, I should wish him to have his regular place\r\nat the table like ourselves; but no, he won\xe2\x80\x99t take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he considers himself above it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Bella, with an airy toss\r\nof her head, \xe2\x80\x98I should leave him alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Boffin, thinking it over. \xe2\x80\x98He don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconsider himself above it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he considers himself beneath it,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella. \xe2\x80\x98If so, he\r\nought to know best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear; nor it ain\xe2\x80\x99t that, neither. No,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Boffin, with\r\na shake of his head, after again thinking it over; \xe2\x80\x98Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s a modest\r\nman, but he don\xe2\x80\x99t consider himself beneath it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what does he consider, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dashed if I know!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98It seemed at first as if it\r\nwas only Lightwood that he objected to meet. And now it seems to be\r\neverybody, except you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOho! thought Miss Bella. \xe2\x80\x98In--deed! That\xe2\x80\x99s it, is it!\xe2\x80\x99 For Mr Mortimer\r\nLightwood had dined there two or three times, and she had met him\r\nelsewhere, and he had shown her some attention. \xe2\x80\x98Rather cool in a\r\nSecretary--and Pa\xe2\x80\x99s lodger--to make me the subject of his jealousy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat Pa\xe2\x80\x99s daughter should be so contemptuous of Pa\xe2\x80\x99s lodger was odd;\r\nbut there were odder anomalies than that in the mind of the spoilt girl:\r\nspoilt first by poverty, and then by wealth. Be it this history\xe2\x80\x99s part,\r\nhowever, to leave them to unravel themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little too much, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Bella reflected scornfully, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nhave Pa\xe2\x80\x99s lodger laying claim to me, and keeping eligible people off!\r\nA little too much, indeed, to have the opportunities opened to me by Mr\r\nand Mrs Boffin, appropriated by a mere Secretary and Pa\xe2\x80\x99s lodger!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet it was not so very long ago that Bella had been fluttered by the\r\ndiscovery that this same Secretary and lodger seem to like her. Ah! but\r\nthe eminently aristocratic mansion and Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s dressmaker had not\r\ncome into play then.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his seemingly retiring manners a very intrusive person, this\r\nSecretary and lodger, in Miss Bella\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. Always a light in his\r\noffice-room when we came home from the play or Opera, and he always at\r\nthe carriage-door to hand us out. Always a provoking radiance too on\r\nMrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face, and an abominably cheerful reception of him, as if it\r\nwere possible seriously to approve what the man had in his mind!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You never charge me, Miss Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, encountering her\r\nby chance alone in the great drawing-room, \xe2\x80\x98with commissions for home.\r\nI shall always be happy to execute any commands you may have in that\r\ndirection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray what may you mean, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Miss Bella, with\r\nlanguidly drooping eyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By home? I mean your father\xe2\x80\x99s house at Holloway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe coloured under the retort--so skilfully thrust, that the words\r\nseemed to be merely a plain answer, given in plain good faith--and said,\r\nrather more emphatically and sharply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What commissions and commands are you speaking of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only little words of remembrance as I assume you sent somehow or\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the Secretary with his former air. \xe2\x80\x98It would be a\r\npleasure to me if you would make me the bearer of them. As you know, I\r\ncome and go between the two houses every day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t remind me of that, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was too quick in this petulant sally against \xe2\x80\x98Pa\xe2\x80\x99s lodger\xe2\x80\x99; and she\r\nfelt that she had been so when she met his quiet look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They don\xe2\x80\x99t send many--what was your expression?--words of remembrance\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, making haste to take refuge in ill-usage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They frequently ask me about you, and I give them such slight\r\nintelligence as I can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s truly given,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you cannot doubt it, for it would be very much against you, if\r\nyou could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I do not doubt it. I deserve the reproach, which is very just\r\nindeed. I beg your pardon, Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should beg you not to do so, but that it shows you to such admirable\r\nadvantage,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied with earnestness. \xe2\x80\x98Forgive me; I could not help\r\nsaying that. To return to what I have digressed from, let me add that\r\nperhaps they think I report them to you, deliver little messages, and\r\nthe like. But I forbear to trouble you, as you never ask me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, looking at him as if he had reproved her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to see them tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that,\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, hesitating, \xe2\x80\x98said to me, or to them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To which you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To both? Shall I make it a message?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can if you like, Mr Rokesmith. Message or no message, I am going to\r\nsee them tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will tell them so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe lingered a moment, as though to give her the opportunity of\r\nprolonging the conversation if she wished. As she remained silent, he\r\nleft her. Two incidents of the little interview were felt by Miss Bella\r\nherself, when alone again, to be very curious. The first was, that he\r\nunquestionably left her with a penitent air upon her, and a penitent\r\nfeeling in her heart. The second was, that she had not an intention or\r\na thought of going home, until she had announced it to him as a settled\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What can I mean by it, or what can he mean by it?\xe2\x80\x99 was her mental\r\ninquiry: \xe2\x80\x98He has no right to any power over me, and how do I come to\r\nmind him when I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin, insisting that Bella should make tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s expedition\r\nin the chariot, she went home in great grandeur. Mrs Wilfer and Miss\r\nLavinia had speculated much on the probabilities and improbabilities of\r\nher coming in this gorgeous state, and, on beholding the chariot from\r\nthe window at which they were secreted to look out for it, agreed\r\nthat it must be detained at the door as long as possible, for the\r\nmortification and confusion of the neighbours. Then they repaired to\r\nthe usual family room, to receive Miss Bella with a becoming show of\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nThe family room looked very small and very mean, and the downward\r\nstaircase by which it was attained looked very narrow and very crooked.\r\nThe little house and all its arrangements were a poor contrast to the\r\neminently aristocratic dwelling. \xe2\x80\x98I can hardly believe,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bella,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I ever did endure life in this place!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGloomy majesty on the part of Mrs Wilfer, and native pertness on the\r\npart of Lavvy, did not mend the matter. Bella really stood in natural\r\nneed of a little help, and she got none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, presenting a cheek to be kissed, as sympathetic\r\nand responsive as the back of the bowl of a spoon, \xe2\x80\x98is quite an honour!\r\nYou will probably find your sister Lavvy grown, Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Lavinia interposed, \xe2\x80\x98there can be no objection to your being\r\naggravating, because Bella richly deserves it; but I really must request\r\nthat you will not drag in such ridiculous nonsense as my having grown\r\nwhen I am past the growing age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I grew, myself,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer sternly proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98after I was married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavvy, \xe2\x80\x98then I think you had much better have\r\nleft it alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lofty glare with which the majestic woman received this answer,\r\nmight have embarrassed a less pert opponent, but it had no effect upon\r\nLavinia: who, leaving her parent to the enjoyment of any amount of\r\nglaring at she might deem desirable under the circumstances, accosted\r\nher sister, undismayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you won\xe2\x80\x99t consider yourself quite disgraced, Bella, if I give\r\nyou a kiss? Well! And how do you do, Bella? And how are your Boffins?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peace!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Hold! I will not suffer this tone of\r\nlevity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My goodness me! How are your Spoffins, then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy, \xe2\x80\x98since Ma so\r\nvery much objects to your Boffins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impertinent girl! Minx!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, with dread severity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether I am a Minx, or a Sphinx,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavinia,\r\ncoolly, tossing her head; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same thing to me, and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nevery bit as soon be one as the other; but I know this--I\xe2\x80\x99ll not grow\r\nafter I\xe2\x80\x99m married!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not? YOU will not?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Wilfer, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Ma, I will not. Nothing shall induce me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer, having waved her gloves, became loftily pathetic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it was to be expected;\xe2\x80\x99 thus she spake. \xe2\x80\x98A child of mine deserts me\r\nfor the proud and prosperous, and another child of mine despises me. It\r\nis quite fitting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 Bella struck in, \xe2\x80\x98Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous, no doubt; but\r\nyou have no right to say they are proud. You must know very well that\r\nthey are not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy, bouncing over to the enemy without a word\r\nof notice, \xe2\x80\x98you must know very well--or if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, more shame for\r\nyou!--that Mr and Mrs Boffin are just absolute perfection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, courteously receiving the deserter, \xe2\x80\x98it\r\nwould seem that we are required to think so. And this, Lavinia, is\r\nmy reason for objecting to a tone of levity. Mrs Boffin (of whose\r\nphysiognomy I can never speak with the composure I would desire to\r\npreserve), and your mother, are not on terms of intimacy. It is not\r\nfor a moment to be supposed that she and her husband dare to presume to\r\nspeak of this family as the Wilfers. I cannot therefore condescend to\r\nspeak of them as the Boffins. No; for such a tone--call it familiarity,\r\nlevity, equality, or what you will--would imply those social\r\ninterchanges which do not exist. Do I render myself intelligible?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout taking the least notice of this inquiry, albeit delivered in an\r\nimposing and forensic manner, Lavinia reminded her sister, \xe2\x80\x98After all,\r\nyou know, Bella, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t told us how your Whatshisnames are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak of them here,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bella, suppressing\r\nindignation, and tapping her foot on the floor. \xe2\x80\x98They are much too kind\r\nand too good to be drawn into these discussions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why put it so?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mrs Wilfer, with biting sarcasm. \xe2\x80\x98Why adopt a\r\ncircuitous form of speech? It is polite and it is obliging; but why do\r\nit? Why not openly say that they are much too kind and too good for US?\r\nWe understand the allusion. Why disguise the phrase?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with one beat of her foot, \xe2\x80\x98you are enough to drive a\r\nsaint mad, and so is Lavvy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunate Lavvy!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Wilfer, in a tone of commiseration. \xe2\x80\x98She\r\nalways comes for it. My poor child!\xe2\x80\x99 But Lavvy, with the suddenness of\r\nher former desertion, now bounced over to the other enemy: very sharply\r\nremarking, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t patronize ME, Ma, because I can take care of myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mrs Wilfer, directing her observations to her\r\nelder daughter, as safer on the whole than her utterly unmanageable\r\nyounger, \xe2\x80\x98that you found time and inclination to tear yourself from\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin, and come to see us at all. I only wonder that our\r\nclaims, contending against the superior claims of Mr and Mrs Boffin,\r\nhad any weight. I feel I ought to be thankful for gaining so much, in\r\ncompetition with Mr and Mrs Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99 (The good lady bitterly emphasized\r\nthe first letter of the word Boffin, as if it represented her chief\r\nobjection to the owners of that name, and as if she could have born\r\nDoffin, Moffin, or Poffin much better.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, angrily, \xe2\x80\x98you force me to say that I am truly sorry I\r\ndid come home, and that I never will come home again, except when poor\r\ndear Pa is here. For, Pa is too magnanimous to feel envy and spite\r\ntowards my generous friends, and Pa is delicate enough and gentle enough\r\nto remember the sort of little claim they thought I had upon them and\r\nthe unusually trying position in which, through no act of my own, I had\r\nbeen placed. And I always did love poor dear Pa better than all the rest\r\nof you put together, and I always do and I always shall!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Bella, deriving no comfort from her charming bonnet and her elegant\r\ndress, burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, R.W.,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Wilfer, lifting up her eyes and\r\napostrophising the air, \xe2\x80\x98that if you were present, it would be a\r\ntrial to your feelings to hear your wife and the mother of your family\r\ndepreciated in your name. But Fate has spared you this, R.W., whatever\r\nit may have thought proper to inflict upon her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Wilfer burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate the Boffins!\xe2\x80\x99 protested Miss Lavinia. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who objects\r\nto their being called the Boffins. I WILL call \xe2\x80\x98em the Boffins. The\r\nBoffins, the Boffins, the Boffins! And I say they are mischief-making\r\nBoffins, and I say the Boffins have set Bella against me, and I tell the\r\nBoffins to their faces:\xe2\x80\x99 which was not strictly the fact, but the\r\nyoung lady was excited: \xe2\x80\x98that they are detestable Boffins, disreputable\r\nBoffins, odious Boffins, beastly Boffins. There!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Miss Lavinia burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe front garden-gate clanked, and the Secretary was seen coming at a\r\nbrisk pace up the steps. \xe2\x80\x98Leave Me to open the door to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs\r\nWilfer, rising with stately resignation as she shook her head and dried\r\nher eyes; \xe2\x80\x98we have at present no stipendiary girl to do so. We have\r\nnothing to conceal. If he sees these traces of emotion on our cheeks,\r\nlet him construe them as he may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith those words she stalked out. In a few moments she stalked in again,\r\nproclaiming in her heraldic manner, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith is the bearer of a\r\npacket for Miss Bella Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Rokesmith followed close upon his name, and of course saw what was\r\namiss. But he discreetly affected to see nothing, and addressed Miss\r\nBella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin intended to have placed this in the carriage for you\r\nthis morning. He wished you to have it, as a little keepsake he had\r\nprepared--it is only a purse, Miss Wilfer--but as he was disappointed in\r\nhis fancy, I volunteered to come after you with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella took it in her hand, and thanked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have been quarrelling here a little, Mr Rokesmith, but not more than\r\nwe used; you know our agreeable ways among ourselves. You find me just\r\ngoing. Good-bye, mamma. Good-bye, Lavvy!\xe2\x80\x99 and with a kiss for each Miss\r\nBella turned to the door. The Secretary would have attended her, but\r\nMrs Wilfer advancing and saying with dignity, \xe2\x80\x98Pardon me! Permit me to\r\nassert my natural right to escort my child to the equipage which is\r\nin waiting for her,\xe2\x80\x99 he begged pardon and gave place. It was a very\r\nmagnificent spectacle indeed, to see Mrs Wilfer throw open the\r\nhouse-door, and loudly demand with extended gloves, \xe2\x80\x98The male domestic\r\nof Mrs Boffin!\xe2\x80\x99 To whom presenting himself, she delivered the brief but\r\nmajestic charge, \xe2\x80\x98Miss Wilfer. Coming out!\xe2\x80\x99 and so delivered her over,\r\nlike a female Lieutenant of the Tower relinquishing a State Prisoner.\r\nThe effect of this ceremonial was for some quarter of an hour afterwards\r\nperfectly paralyzing on the neighbours, and was much enhanced by the\r\nworthy lady airing herself for that term in a kind of splendidly serene\r\ntrance on the top step.\r\n\r\nWhen Bella was seated in the carriage, she opened the little packet in\r\nher hand. It contained a pretty purse, and the purse contained a bank\r\nnote for fifty pounds. \xe2\x80\x98This shall be a joyful surprise for poor dear\r\nPa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it myself into the City!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she was uninformed respecting the exact locality of the place of\r\nbusiness of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles, but knew it to be near\r\nMincing Lane, she directed herself to be driven to the corner of that\r\ndarksome spot. Thence she despatched \xe2\x80\x98the male domestic of Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin search of the counting-house of Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles, with\r\na message importing that if R. Wilfer could come out, there was a lady\r\nwaiting who would be glad to speak with him. The delivery of these\r\nmysterious words from the mouth of a footman caused so great an\r\nexcitement in the counting-house, that a youthful scout was instantly\r\nappointed to follow Rumty, observe the lady, and come in with his\r\nreport. Nor was the agitation by any means diminished, when the scout\r\nrushed back with the intelligence that the lady was \xe2\x80\x98a slap-up gal in a\r\nbang-up chariot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRumty himself, with his pen behind his ear under his rusty hat, arrived\r\nat the carriage-door in a breathless condition, and had been fairly\r\nlugged into the vehicle by his cravat and embraced almost unto choking,\r\nbefore he recognized his daughter. \xe2\x80\x98My dear child!\xe2\x80\x99 he then panted,\r\nincoherently. \xe2\x80\x98Good gracious me! What a lovely woman you are! I thought\r\nyou had been unkind and forgotten your mother and sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have just been to see them, Pa dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! and how--how did you find your mother?\xe2\x80\x99 asked R. W., dubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very disagreeable, Pa, and so was Lavvy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are sometimes a little liable to it,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the patient cherub;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I hope you made allowances, Bella, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I was disagreeable too, Pa; we were all of us disagreeable\r\ntogether. But I want you to come and dine with me somewhere, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my dear, I have already partaken of a--if one might mention such\r\nan article in this superb chariot--of a--Saveloy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied R. Wilfer,\r\nmodestly dropping his voice on the word, as he eyed the canary-coloured\r\nfittings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Pa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t as much as one could sometimes wish it to be, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x99 he admitted, drawing his hand across his mouth. \xe2\x80\x98Still, when\r\ncircumstances over which you have no control, interpose obstacles\r\nbetween yourself and Small Germans, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do better than bring a\r\ncontented mind to hear on\xe2\x80\x99--again dropping his voice in deference to the\r\nchariot--\xe2\x80\x98Saveloys!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You poor good Pa! Pa, do, I beg and pray, get leave for the rest of the\r\nday, and come and pass it with me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut back and ask for leave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But before you cut back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, who had already taken him by the\r\nchin, pulled his hat off, and begun to stick up his hair in her old way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98do say that you are sure I am giddy and inconsiderate, but have never\r\nreally slighted you, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, I say it with all my heart. And might I likewise observe,\xe2\x80\x99 her\r\nfather delicately hinted, with a glance out at window, \xe2\x80\x98that perhaps\r\nit might be calculated to attract attention, having one\xe2\x80\x99s hair publicly\r\ndone by a lovely woman in an elegant turn-out in Fenchurch Street?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella laughed and put on his hat again. But when his boyish figure\r\nbobbed away, its shabbiness and cheerful patience smote the tears out\r\nof her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98I hate that Secretary for thinking it of me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x98and yet it seems half true!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBack came her father, more like a boy than ever, in his release from\r\nschool. \xe2\x80\x98All right, my dear. Leave given at once. Really very handsomely\r\ndone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now where can we find some quiet place, Pa, in which I can wait for you\r\nwhile you go on an errand for me, if I send the carriage away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt demanded cogitation. \xe2\x80\x98You see, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he explained, \xe2\x80\x98you really\r\nhave become such a very lovely woman, that it ought to be a very quiet\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x99 At length he suggested, \xe2\x80\x98Near the garden up by the Trinity House\r\non Tower Hill.\xe2\x80\x99 So, they were driven there, and Bella dismissed the\r\nchariot; sending a pencilled note by it to Mrs Boffin, that she was with\r\nher father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Pa, attend to what I am going to say, and promise and vow to be\r\nobedient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promise and vow, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ask no questions. You take this purse; you go to the nearest place\r\nwhere they keep everything of the very very best, ready made; you buy\r\nand put on, the most beautiful suit of clothes, the most beautiful hat,\r\nand the most beautiful pair of bright boots (patent leather, Pa, mind!)\r\nthat are to be got for money; and you come back to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Bella--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care, Pa!\xe2\x80\x99 pointing her forefinger at him, merrily. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\npromised and vowed. It\xe2\x80\x99s perjury, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was water in the foolish little fellow\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, but she kissed them\r\ndry (though her own were wet), and he bobbed away again. After half an\r\nhour, he came back, so brilliantly transformed, that Bella was obliged\r\nto walk round him in ecstatic admiration twenty times, before she could\r\ndraw her arm through his, and delightedly squeeze it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, hugging him close, \xe2\x80\x98take this lovely woman out to\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where shall we go, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Greenwich!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, valiantly. \xe2\x80\x98And be sure you treat this lovely\r\nwoman with everything of the best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile they were going along to take boat, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you wish, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid R. W., timidly, \xe2\x80\x98that your mother was here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Pa, for I like to have you all to myself to-day. I was\r\nalways your little favourite at home, and you were always mine. We have\r\nrun away together often, before now; haven\xe2\x80\x99t we, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, to be sure we have! Many a Sunday when your mother was--was a\r\nlittle liable to it,\xe2\x80\x99 repeating his former delicate expression after\r\npausing to cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and I am afraid I was seldom or never as good as I ought to have\r\nbeen, Pa. I made you carry me, over and over again, when you should\r\nhave made me walk; and I often drove you in harness, when you would much\r\nrather have sat down and read your news-paper: didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes, sometimes. But Lor, what a child you were! What a companion\r\nyou were!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Companion? That\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want to be to-day, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are safe to succeed, my love. Your brothers and sisters have all\r\nin their turns been companions to me, to a certain extent, but only to a\r\ncertain extent. Your mother has, throughout life, been a companion that\r\nany man might--might look up to--and--and commit the sayings of, to\r\nmemory--and--form himself upon--if he--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he liked the model?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We-ell, ye-es,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, thinking about it, not quite satisfied\r\nwith the phrase: \xe2\x80\x98or perhaps I might say, if it was in him. Supposing,\r\nfor instance, that a man wanted to be always marching, he would find\r\nyour mother an inestimable companion. But if he had any taste for\r\nwalking, or should wish at any time to break into a trot, he might\r\nsometimes find it a little difficult to keep step with your mother.\r\nOr take it this way, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Supposing that a man had to go through life, we won\xe2\x80\x99t say with a\r\ncompanion, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll say to a tune. Very good. Supposing that the tune\r\nallotted to him was the Dead March in Saul. Well. It would be a very\r\nsuitable tune for particular occasions--none better--but it would\r\nbe difficult to keep time with in the ordinary run of domestic\r\ntransactions. For instance, if he took his supper after a hard day, to\r\nthe Dead March in Saul, his food might be likely to sit heavy on him.\r\nOr, if he was at any time inclined to relieve his mind by singing a\r\ncomic song or dancing a hornpipe, and was obliged to do it to the Dead\r\nMarch in Saul, he might find himself put out in the execution of his\r\nlively intentions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Pa!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bella, as she hung upon his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, what I will say for you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 the cherub pursued mildly and\r\nwithout a notion of complaining, \xe2\x80\x98is, that you are so adaptable. So\r\nadaptable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed I am afraid I have shown a wretched temper, Pa. I am afraid\r\nI have been very complaining, and very capricious. I seldom or never\r\nthought of it before. But when I sat in the carriage just now and saw\r\nyou coming along the pavement, I reproached myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, my dear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA happy and a chatty man was Pa in his new clothes that day. Take it\r\nfor all in all, it was perhaps the happiest day he had ever known in his\r\nlife; not even excepting that on which his heroic partner had approached\r\nthe nuptial altar to the tune of the Dead March in Saul.\r\n\r\nThe little expedition down the river was delightful, and the little\r\nroom overlooking the river into which they were shown for dinner was\r\ndelightful. Everything was delightful. The park was delightful, the\r\npunch was delightful, the dishes of fish were delightful, the wine\r\nwas delightful. Bella was more delightful than any other item in the\r\nfestival; drawing Pa out in the gayest manner; making a point of always\r\nmentioning herself as the lovely woman; stimulating Pa to order things,\r\nby declaring that the lovely woman insisted on being treated with them;\r\nand in short causing Pa to be quite enraptured with the consideration\r\nthat he WAS the Pa of such a charming daughter.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as they sat looking at the ships and steamboats making their\r\nway to the sea with the tide that was running down, the lovely woman\r\nimagined all sorts of voyages for herself and Pa. Now, Pa, in the\r\ncharacter of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier, was tacking\r\naway to Newcastle, to fetch black diamonds to make his fortune with;\r\nnow, Pa was going to China in that handsome threemasted ship, to bring\r\nhome opium, with which he would for ever cut out Chicksey Veneering\r\nand Stobbles, and to bring home silks and shawls without end for the\r\ndecoration of his charming daughter. Now, John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous fate\r\nwas all a dream, and he had come home and found the lovely woman just\r\nthe article for him, and the lovely woman had found him just the article\r\nfor her, and they were going away on a trip, in their gallant bark,\r\nto look after their vines, with streamers flying at all points, a band\r\nplaying on deck and Pa established in the great cabin. Now, John Harmon\r\nwas consigned to his grave again, and a merchant of immense wealth\r\n(name unknown) had courted and married the lovely woman, and he was\r\nso enormously rich that everything you saw upon the river sailing or\r\nsteaming belonged to him, and he kept a perfect fleet of yachts for\r\npleasure, and that little impudent yacht which you saw over there, with\r\nthe great white sail, was called The Bella, in honour of his wife, and\r\nshe held her state aboard when it pleased her, like a modern Cleopatra.\r\nAnon, there would embark in that troop-ship when she got to Gravesend, a\r\nmighty general, of large property (name also unknown), who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear of going to victory without his wife, and whose wife was the lovely\r\nwoman, and she was destined to become the idol of all the red coats and\r\nblue jackets alow and aloft. And then again: you saw that ship being\r\ntowed out by a steam-tug? Well! where did you suppose she was going to?\r\nShe was going among the coral reefs and cocoa-nuts and all that sort of\r\nthing, and she was chartered for a fortunate individual of the name\r\nof Pa (himself on board, and much respected by all hands), and she\r\nwas going, for his sole profit and advantage, to fetch a cargo of\r\nsweet-smelling woods, the most beautiful that ever were seen, and the\r\nmost profitable that ever were heard of; and her cargo would be a great\r\nfortune, as indeed it ought to be: the lovely woman who had purchased\r\nher and fitted her expressly for this voyage, being married to an Indian\r\nPrince, who was a Something-or-Other, and who wore Cashmere shawls all\r\nover himself and diamonds and emeralds blazing in his turban, and was\r\nbeautifully coffee-coloured and excessively devoted, though a little too\r\njealous. Thus Bella ran on merrily, in a manner perfectly enchanting to\r\nPa, who was as willing to put his head into the Sultan\xe2\x80\x99s tub of water as\r\nthe beggar-boys below the window were to put THEIR heads in the mud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pa after dinner, \xe2\x80\x98we may come to the\r\nconclusion at home, that we have lost you for good?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella shook her head. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say. All she was able to\r\nreport was, that she was most handsomely supplied with everything she\r\ncould possibly want, and that whenever she hinted at leaving Mr and Mrs\r\nBoffin, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bella, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a confession to you. I am the\r\nmost mercenary little wretch that ever lived in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should hardly have thought it of you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her father,\r\nfirst glancing at himself; and then at the dessert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand what you mean, Pa, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I care\r\nfor money to keep as money, but I do care so much for what it will buy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really I think most of us do,\xe2\x80\x99 returned R. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But not to the dreadful extent that I do, Pa. O-o!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella,\r\nscrewing the exclamation out of herself with a twist of her dimpled\r\nchin. \xe2\x80\x98I AM so mercenary!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a wistful glance R. W. said, in default of having anything better\r\nto say: \xe2\x80\x98About when did you begin to feel it coming on, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it, Pa. That\xe2\x80\x99s the terrible part of it. When I was at home, and\r\nonly knew what it was to be poor, I grumbled but didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much mind.\r\nWhen I was at home expecting to be rich, I thought vaguely of all the\r\ngreat things I would do. But when I had been disappointed of my splendid\r\nfortune, and came to see it from day to day in other hands, and to have\r\nbefore my eyes what it could really do, then I became the mercenary\r\nlittle wretch I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s your fancy, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can assure you it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing of the sort, Pa!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, nodding at\r\nhim, with her very pretty eyebrows raised as high as they would go, and\r\nlooking comically frightened. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. I am always avariciously\r\nscheming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor! But how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Pa. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling YOU, because we have always\r\nbeen favourites of each other\xe2\x80\x99s, and because you are not like a Pa, but\r\nmore like a sort of a younger brother with a dear venerable chubbiness\r\non him. And besides,\xe2\x80\x99 added Bella, laughing as she pointed a rallying\r\nfinger at his face, \xe2\x80\x98because I have got you in my power. This is a\r\nsecret expedition. If ever you tell of me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell of you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nMa that you dined at Greenwich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; seriously, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 observed R. W., with some trepidation of\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98it might be as well not to mention it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, sir! So you keep my\r\nconfidence, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep yours. But betray the lovely woman, and you\r\nshall find her a serpent. Now, you may give me a kiss, Pa, and I should\r\nlike to give your hair a turn, because it has been dreadfully neglected\r\nin my absence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nR. W. submitted his head to the operator, and the operator went on\r\ntalking; at the same time putting separate locks of his hair through\r\na curious process of being smartly rolled over her two revolving\r\nforefingers, which were then suddenly pulled out of it in opposite\r\nlateral directions. On each of these occasions the patient winced and\r\nwinked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have made up my mind that I must have money, Pa. I feel that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeg it, borrow it, or steal it; and so I have resolved that I must marry\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nR. W. cast up his eyes towards her, as well as he could under the\r\noperating circumstances, and said in a tone of remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x98My de-ar\r\nBella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have resolved, I say, Pa, that to get money I must marry money. In\r\nconsequence of which, I am always looking out for money to captivate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My de-a-r Bella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Pa, that is the state of the case. If ever there was a mercenary\r\nplotter whose thoughts and designs were always in her mean occupation, I\r\nam the amiable creature. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I hate and detest being\r\npoor, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be poor if I can marry money. Now you are deliciously\r\nfluffy, Pa, and in a state to astonish the waiter and pay the bill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, my dear Bella, this is quite alarming at your age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you so, Pa, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, with a\r\npleasant childish gravity. \xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it shocking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be quite so, if you fully knew what you said, my dear, or\r\nmeant it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Pa, I can only tell you that I mean nothing else. Talk to me of\r\nlove!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, contemptuously: though her face and figure certainly\r\nrendered the subject no incongruous one. \xe2\x80\x98Talk to me of fiery dragons!\r\nBut talk to me of poverty and wealth, and there indeed we touch upon\r\nrealities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My De-ar, this is becoming Awful--\xe2\x80\x99 her father was emphatically\r\nbeginning: when she stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa, tell me. Did you marry money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella hummed the Dead March in Saul, and said, after all it signified\r\nvery little! But seeing him look grave and downcast, she took him round\r\nthe neck and kissed him back to cheerfulness again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that last touch, Pa; it was only said in joke. Now mind!\r\nYou are not to tell of me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll not tell of you. And more than that;\r\nI promise to have no secrets from you, Pa, and you may make certain\r\nthat, whatever mercenary things go on, I shall always tell you all about\r\nthem in strict confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFain to be satisfied with this concession from the lovely woman, R. W.\r\nrang the bell, and paid the bill. \xe2\x80\x98Now, all the rest of this, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella, rolling up the purse when they were alone again, hammering it\r\nsmall with her little fist on the table, and cramming it into one of the\r\npockets of his new waistcoat, \xe2\x80\x98is for you, to buy presents with for them\r\nat home, and to pay bills with, and to divide as you like, and spend\r\nexactly as you think proper. Last of all take notice, Pa, that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot the fruit of any avaricious scheme. Perhaps if it was, your little\r\nmercenary wretch of a daughter wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make so free with it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter which, she tugged at his coat with both hands, and pulled him all\r\naskew in buttoning that garment over the precious waistcoat pocket, and\r\nthen tied her dimples into her bonnet-strings in a very knowing way, and\r\ntook him back to London. Arrived at Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s door, she set him with\r\nhis back against it, tenderly took him by the ears as convenient handles\r\nfor her purpose, and kissed him until he knocked muffled double knocks\r\nat the door with the back of his head. That done, she once more reminded\r\nhim of their compact and gaily parted from him.\r\n\r\nNot so gaily, however, but that tears filled her eyes as he went away\r\ndown the dark street. Not so gaily, but that she several times said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor little Pa! Ah, poor dear struggling shabby little Pa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbefore she took heart to knock at the door. Not so gaily, but that the\r\nbrilliant furniture seemed to stare her out of countenance as if it\r\ninsisted on being compared with the dingy furniture at home. Not so\r\ngaily, but that she fell into very low spirits sitting late in her own\r\nroom, and very heartily wept, as she wished, now that the deceased old\r\nJohn Harmon had never made a will about her, now that the deceased young\r\nJohn Harmon had lived to marry her. \xe2\x80\x98Contradictory things to wish,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella, \xe2\x80\x98but my life and fortunes are so contradictory altogether that\r\nwhat can I expect myself to be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THE ORPHAN MAKES HIS WILL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary, working in the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning, was\r\ninformed that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy.\r\nThe footman who communicated this intelligence made a decent pause\r\nbefore uttering the name, to express that it was forced on his\r\nreluctance by the youth in question, and that if the youth had had\r\nthe good sense and good taste to inherit some other name it would have\r\nspared the feelings of him the bearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Boffin will be very well pleased,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary in a\r\nperfectly composed way. \xe2\x80\x98Show him in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sloppy being introduced, remained close to the door: revealing\r\nin various parts of his form many surprising, confounding, and\r\nincomprehensible buttons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Rokesmith, in a cheerful tone of\r\nwelcome. \xe2\x80\x98I have been expecting you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSloppy explained that he had meant to come before, but that the Orphan\r\n(of whom he made mention as Our Johnny) had been ailing, and he had\r\nwaited to report him well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he is well now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No he ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy.\r\n\r\nMr Sloppy having shaken his head to a considerable extent, proceeded\r\nto remark that he thought Johnny \xe2\x80\x98must have took \xe2\x80\x98em from the Minders.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBeing asked what he meant, he answered, them that come out upon him and\r\npartickler his chest. Being requested to explain himself, he stated that\r\nthere was some of \xe2\x80\x98em wot you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t kiver with a sixpence. Pressed to\r\nfall back upon a nominative case, he opined that they wos about as\r\nred as ever red could be. \xe2\x80\x98But as long as they strikes out\xe2\x80\x99ards, sir,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Sloppy, \xe2\x80\x98they ain\xe2\x80\x99t so much. It\xe2\x80\x99s their striking in\xe2\x80\x99ards\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s to be kep off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn Rokesmith hoped the child had had medical attendance? Oh yes, said\r\nSloppy, he had been took to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s shop once. And what did the\r\ndoctor call it? Rokesmith asked him. After some perplexed reflection,\r\nSloppy answered, brightening, \xe2\x80\x98He called it something as wos wery\r\nlong for spots.\xe2\x80\x99 Rokesmith suggested measles. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy with\r\nconfidence, \xe2\x80\x98ever so much longer than THEM, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 (Mr Sloppy was\r\nelevated by this fact, and seemed to consider that it reflected credit\r\non the poor little patient.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Boffin will be sorry to hear this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Higden said so, sir, when she kep it from her, hoping as Our Johnny\r\nwould work round.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I hope he will?\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, with a quick turn upon the\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Sloppy. \xe2\x80\x98It all depends on their striking\r\nin\xe2\x80\x99ards.\xe2\x80\x99 He then went on to say that whether Johnny had \xe2\x80\x98took \xe2\x80\x98em\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfrom the Minders, or whether the Minders had \xe2\x80\x98took \xe2\x80\x99em from Johnny,\r\nthe Minders had been sent home and had \xe2\x80\x98got \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x99 Furthermore, that Mrs\r\nHigden\xe2\x80\x99s days and nights being devoted to Our Johnny, who was never out\r\nof her lap, the whole of the mangling arrangements had devolved upon\r\nhimself, and he had had \xe2\x80\x98rayther a tight time\xe2\x80\x99. The ungainly piece of\r\nhonesty beamed and blushed as he said it, quite enraptured with the\r\nremembrance of having been serviceable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Last night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, \xe2\x80\x98when I was a-turning at the wheel pretty\r\nlate, the mangle seemed to go like Our Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s breathing. It begun\r\nbeautiful, then as it went out it shook a little and got unsteady, then\r\nas it took the turn to come home it had a rattle-like and lumbered a\r\nbit, then it come smooth, and so it went on till I scarce know\xe2\x80\x99d which\r\nwas mangle and which was Our Johnny. Nor Our Johnny, he scarce know\xe2\x80\x99d\r\neither, for sometimes when the mangle lumbers he says, \xe2\x80\x9cMe choking,\r\nGranny!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs Higden holds him up in her lap and says to me \xe2\x80\x9cBide a\r\nbit, Sloppy,\xe2\x80\x9d and we all stops together. And when Our Johnny gets his\r\nbreathing again, I turns again, and we all goes on together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSloppy had gradually expanded with his description into a stare and a\r\nvacant grin. He now contracted, being silent, into a half-repressed gush\r\nof tears, and, under pretence of being heated, drew the under part of\r\nhis sleeve across his eyes with a singularly awkward, laborious, and\r\nroundabout smear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith. \xe2\x80\x98I must go and break it to Mrs\r\nBoffin. Stay you here, Sloppy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSloppy stayed there, staring at the pattern of the paper on the wall,\r\nuntil the Secretary and Mrs Boffin came back together. And with Mrs\r\nBoffin was a young lady (Miss Bella Wilfer by name) who was better worth\r\nstaring at, it occurred to Sloppy, than the best of wall-papering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, my poor dear pretty little John Harmon!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes mum,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sympathetic Sloppy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is in a very, very bad way, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the\r\npleasant creature with her wholesome cordiality.\r\n\r\nPut upon his good faith, and finding it in collision with his\r\ninclinations, Sloppy threw back his head and uttered a mellifluous howl,\r\nrounded off with a sniff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So bad as that!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98And Betty Higden not to tell me of\r\nit sooner!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she might have been mistrustful, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Sloppy,\r\nhesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of what, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she might have been mistrustful, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sloppy with\r\nsubmission, \xe2\x80\x98of standing in Our Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s light. There\xe2\x80\x99s so much trouble\r\nin illness, and so much expense, and she\xe2\x80\x99s seen such a lot of its being\r\nobjected to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But she never can have thought,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that I would grudge\r\nthe dear child anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No mum, but she might have thought (as a habit-like) of its standing\r\nin Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s light, and might have tried to bring him through it\r\nunbeknownst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSloppy knew his ground well. To conceal herself in sickness, like a\r\nlower animal; to creep out of sight and coil herself away and die; had\r\nbecome this woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct. To catch up in her arms the sick child who\r\nwas dear to her, and hide it as if it were a criminal, and keep off all\r\nministration but such as her own ignorant tenderness and patience could\r\nsupply, had become this woman\xe2\x80\x99s idea of maternal love, fidelity, and\r\nduty. The shameful accounts we read, every week in the Christian year,\r\nmy lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, the infamous records of\r\nsmall official inhumanity, do not pass by the people as they pass by\r\nus. And hence these irrational, blind, and obstinate prejudices, so\r\nastonishing to our magnificence, and having no more reason in them--God\r\nsave the Queen and Confound their politics--no, than smoke has in coming\r\nfrom fire!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not a right place for the poor child to stay in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell us, dear Mr Rokesmith, what to do for the best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had already thought what to do, and the consultation was very short.\r\nHe could pave the way, he said, in half an hour, and then they would go\r\ndown to Brentford. \xe2\x80\x98Pray take me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. Therefore a carriage was\r\nordered, of capacity to take them all, and in the meantime Sloppy\r\nwas regaled, feasting alone in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s room, with a complete\r\nrealization of that fairy vision--meat, beer, vegetables, and pudding.\r\nIn consequence of which his buttons became more importunate of public\r\nnotice than before, with the exception of two or three about the region\r\nof the waistband, which modestly withdrew into a creasy retirement.\r\n\r\nPunctual to the time, appeared the carriage and the Secretary. He sat\r\non the box, and Mr Sloppy graced the rumble. So, to the Three Magpies as\r\nbefore: where Mrs Boffin and Miss Bella were handed out, and whence they\r\nall went on foot to Mrs Betty Higden\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBut, on the way down, they had stopped at a toy-shop, and had bought\r\nthat noble charger, a description of whose points and trappings had on\r\nthe last occasion conciliated the then worldly-minded orphan, and also a\r\nNoah\xe2\x80\x99s ark, and also a yellow bird with an artificial voice in him,\r\nand also a military doll so well dressed that if he had only been of\r\nlife-size his brother-officers in the Guards might never have found him\r\nout. Bearing these gifts, they raised the latch of Betty Higden\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\nand saw her sitting in the dimmest and furthest corner with poor Johnny\r\nin her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how\xe2\x80\x99s my boy, Betty?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Boffin, sitting down beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s bad! He\xe2\x80\x99s bad!\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty. \xe2\x80\x98I begin to be afeerd he\xe2\x80\x99ll not be\r\nyours any more than mine. All others belonging to him have gone to\r\nthe Power and the Glory, and I have a mind that they\xe2\x80\x99re drawing him to\r\nthem--leading him away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why else he clenches his little hand as if it had hold of\r\na finger that I can\xe2\x80\x99t see. Look at it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, opening the wrappers\r\nin which the flushed child lay, and showing his small right hand lying\r\nclosed upon his breast. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s always so. It don\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he asleep?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I think not. You\xe2\x80\x99re not asleep, my Johnny?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Johnny, with a quiet air of pity for himself; and without\r\nopening his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the lady, Johnny. And the horse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohnny could bear the lady, with complete indifference, but not the\r\nhorse. Opening his heavy eyes, he slowly broke into a smile on beholding\r\nthat splendid phenomenon, and wanted to take it in his arms. As it was\r\nmuch too big, it was put upon a chair where he could hold it by the mane\r\nand contemplate it. Which he soon forgot to do.\r\n\r\nBut, Johnny murmuring something with his eyes closed, and Mrs Boffin\r\nnot knowing what, old Betty bent her ear to listen and took pains to\r\nunderstand. Being asked by her to repeat what he had said, he did so two\r\nor three times, and then it came out that he must have seen more than\r\nthey supposed when he looked up to see the horse, for the murmur was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is the boofer lady?\xe2\x80\x99 Now, the boofer, or beautiful, lady was Bella;\r\nand whereas this notice from the poor baby would have touched her of\r\nitself; it was rendered more pathetic by the late melting of her heart\r\nto her poor little father, and their joke about the lovely woman. So,\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour was very tender and very natural when she kneeled on\r\nthe brick floor to clasp the child, and when the child, with a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmiration of what is young and pretty, fondled the boofer lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my good dear Betty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, hoping that she saw her\r\nopportunity, and laying her hand persuasively on her arm; \xe2\x80\x98we have come\r\nto remove Johnny from this cottage to where he can be taken better care\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInstantly, and before another word could be spoken, the old woman\r\nstarted up with blazing eyes, and rushed at the door with the sick\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stand away from me every one of ye!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried out wildly. \xe2\x80\x98I see what\r\nye mean now. Let me go my way, all of ye. I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner kill the Pretty,\r\nand kill myself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, stay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, soothing her. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I understand too well. I know too much about it, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ve run from\r\nit too many a year. No! Never for me, nor for the child, while there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwater enough in England to cover us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe terror, the shame, the passion of horror and repugnance, firing the\r\nworn face and perfectly maddening it, would have been a quite terrible\r\nsight, if embodied in one old fellow-creature alone. Yet it \xe2\x80\x98crops\r\nup\xe2\x80\x99--as our slang goes--my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, in\r\nother fellow-creatures, rather frequently!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s been chasing me all my life, but it shall never take me nor mine\r\nalive!\xe2\x80\x99 cried old Betty. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve done with ye. I\xe2\x80\x99d have fastened door and\r\nwindow and starved out, afore I\xe2\x80\x99d ever have let ye in, if I had known\r\nwhat ye came for!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, catching sight of Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s wholesome face, she relented, and\r\ncrouching down by the door and bending over her burden to hush it, said\r\nhumbly: \xe2\x80\x98Maybe my fears has put me wrong. If they have so, tell me, and\r\nthe good Lord forgive me! I\xe2\x80\x99m quick to take this fright, I know, and my\r\nhead is summ\xe2\x80\x99at light with wearying and watching.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there, there!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Come, come! Say no more of\r\nit, Betty. It was a mistake, a mistake. Any one of us might have made it\r\nin your place, and felt just as you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lord bless ye!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, stretching out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, see, Betty,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the sweet compassionate soul, holding the\r\nhand kindly, \xe2\x80\x98what I really did mean, and what I should have begun by\r\nsaying out, if I had only been a little wiser and handier. We want to\r\nmove Johnny to a place where there are none but children; a place set\r\nup on purpose for sick children; where the good doctors and nurses pass\r\ntheir lives with children, talk to none but children, touch none but\r\nchildren, comfort and cure none but children.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there really such a place?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the old woman, with a gaze of\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Betty, on my word, and you shall see it. If my home was a better\r\nplace for the dear boy, I\xe2\x80\x99d take him to it; but indeed indeed it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall take him,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Betty, fervently kissing the comforting\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x98where you will, my deary. I am not so hard, but that I believe\r\nyour face and voice, and I will, as long as I can see and hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis victory gained, Rokesmith made haste to profit by it, for he saw\r\nhow woefully time had been lost. He despatched Sloppy to bring the\r\ncarriage to the door; caused the child to be carefully wrapped up; bade\r\nold Betty get her bonnet on; collected the toys, enabling the little\r\nfellow to comprehend that his treasures were to be transported with\r\nhim; and had all things prepared so easily that they were ready for\r\nthe carriage as soon as it appeared, and in a minute afterwards were\r\non their way. Sloppy they left behind, relieving his overcharged breast\r\nwith a paroxysm of mangling.\r\n\r\nAt the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, the gallant steed, the Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark, yellow\r\nbird, and the officer in the Guards, were made as welcome as their\r\nchild-owner. But the doctor said aside to Rokesmith, \xe2\x80\x98This should have\r\nbeen days ago. Too late!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, they were all carried up into a fresh airy room, and there\r\nJohnny came to himself, out of a sleep or a swoon or whatever it was,\r\nto find himself lying in a little quiet bed, with a little platform over\r\nhis breast, on which were already arranged, to give him heart and urge\r\nhim to cheer up, the Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark, the noble steed, and the yellow bird;\r\nwith the officer in the Guards doing duty over the whole, quite as much\r\nto the satisfaction of his country as if he had been upon Parade. And at\r\nthe bed\xe2\x80\x99s head was a coloured picture beautiful to see, representing as\r\nit were another Johnny seated on the knee of some Angel surely who loved\r\nlittle children. And, marvellous fact, to lie and stare at: Johnny had\r\nbecome one of a little family, all in little quiet beds (except two\r\nplaying dominoes in little arm-chairs at a little table on the hearth):\r\nand on all the little beds were little platforms whereon were to be\r\nseen dolls\xe2\x80\x99 houses, woolly dogs with mechanical barks in them not very\r\ndissimilar from the artificial voice pervading the bowels of the yellow\r\nbird, tin armies, Moorish tumblers, wooden tea things, and the riches of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nAs Johnny murmured something in his placid admiration, the ministering\r\nwomen at his bed\xe2\x80\x99s head asked him what he said. It seemed that he wanted\r\nto know whether all these were brothers and sisters of his? So they told\r\nhim yes. It seemed then, that he wanted to know whether God had brought\r\nthem all together there? So they told him yes again. They made out then,\r\nthat he wanted to know whether they would all get out of pain? So they\r\nanswered yes to that question likewise, and made him understand that the\r\nreply included himself.\r\n\r\nJohnny\xe2\x80\x99s powers of sustaining conversation were as yet so very\r\nimperfectly developed, even in a state of health, that in sickness they\r\nwere little more than monosyllabic. But, he had to be washed and tended,\r\nand remedies were applied, and though those offices were far, far more\r\nskilfully and lightly done than ever anything had been done for him in\r\nhis little life, so rough and short, they would have hurt and tired him\r\nbut for an amazing circumstance which laid hold of his attention. This\r\nwas no less than the appearance on his own little platform in pairs,\r\nof All Creation, on its way into his own particular ark: the elephant\r\nleading, and the fly, with a diffident sense of his size, politely\r\nbringing up the rear. A very little brother lying in the next bed with a\r\nbroken leg, was so enchanted by this spectacle that his delight exalted\r\nits enthralling interest; and so came rest and sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see you are not afraid to leave the dear child here, Betty,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhispered Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Most willingly, most thankfully, with all my heart and\r\nsoul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, they kissed him, and left him there, and old Betty was to come back\r\nearly in the morning, and nobody but Rokesmith knew for certain how that\r\nthe doctor had said, \xe2\x80\x98This should have been days ago. Too late!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, Rokesmith knowing it, and knowing that his bearing it in mind would\r\nbe acceptable thereafter to that good woman who had been the only light\r\nin the childhood of desolate John Harmon dead and gone, resolved that\r\nlate at night he would go back to the bedside of John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s namesake,\r\nand see how it fared with him.\r\n\r\nThe family whom God had brought together were not all asleep, but were\r\nall quiet. From bed to bed, a light womanly tread and a pleasant fresh\r\nface passed in the silence of the night. A little head would lift itself\r\nup into the softened light here and there, to be kissed as the face went\r\nby--for these little patients are very loving--and would then submit\r\nitself to be composed to rest again. The mite with the broken leg was\r\nrestless, and moaned; but after a while turned his face towards Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed, to fortify himself with a view of the ark, and fell asleep. Over\r\nmost of the beds, the toys were yet grouped as the children had left\r\nthem when they last laid themselves down, and, in their innocent\r\ngrotesqueness and incongruity, they might have stood for the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came in too, to see how it fared with Johnny. And he and\r\nRokesmith stood together, looking down with compassion on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it, Johnny?\xe2\x80\x99 Rokesmith was the questioner, and put an arm round\r\nthe poor baby as he made a struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Him!\xe2\x80\x99 said the little fellow. \xe2\x80\x98Those!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe doctor was quick to understand children, and, taking the horse,\r\nthe ark, the yellow bird, and the man in the Guards, from Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s bed,\r\nsoftly placed them on that of his next neighbour, the mite with the\r\nbroken leg.\r\n\r\nWith a weary and yet a pleased smile, and with an action as if he\r\nstretched his little figure out to rest, the child heaved his body on\r\nthe sustaining arm, and seeking Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s face with his lips, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A kiss for the boofer lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving now bequeathed all he had to dispose of, and arranged his affairs\r\nin this world, Johnny, thus speaking, left it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nA SUCCESSOR\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the Reverend Frank Milvey\xe2\x80\x99s brethren had found themselves\r\nexceedingly uncomfortable in their minds, because they were required to\r\nbury the dead too hopefully. But, the Reverend Frank, inclining to the\r\nbelief that they were required to do one or two other things (say out of\r\nnine-and-thirty) calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if\r\nthey would think as much about them, held his peace.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man, who noticed many\r\nsad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein he worked, and did not\r\nprofess that they made him savagely wise. He only learned that the more\r\nhe himself knew, in his little limited human way, the better he could\r\ndistantly imagine what Omniscience might know.\r\n\r\nWherefore, if the Reverend Frank had had to read the words that troubled\r\nsome of his brethren, and profitably touched innumerable hearts, in\r\na worse case than Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s, he would have done so out of the pity and\r\nhumility of his soul. Reading them over Johnny, he thought of his own\r\nsix children, but not of his poverty, and read them with dimmed eyes.\r\nAnd very seriously did he and his bright little wife, who had been\r\nlistening, look down into the small grave and walk home arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\nThere was grief in the aristocratic house, and there was joy in the\r\nBower. Mr Wegg argued, if an orphan were wanted, was he not an orphan\r\nhimself; and could a better be desired? And why go beating about\r\nBrentford bushes, seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims\r\nupon you and made no sacrifices for you, when here was an orphan ready\r\nto your hand who had given up in your cause, Miss Elizabeth, Master\r\nGeorge, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker?\r\n\r\nMr Wegg chuckled, consequently, when he heard the tidings. Nay, it was\r\nafterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless,\r\nthat in the seclusion of the Bower he poked out his wooden leg, in the\r\nstage-ballet manner, and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on\r\nthe genuine leg remaining to him.\r\n\r\nJohn Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time, was more the\r\nmanner of a young man towards a mother, than that of a Secretary towards\r\nhis employer\xe2\x80\x99s wife. It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate\r\ndeference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his\r\nengagement; whatever was odd in her dress or her ways had seemed to have\r\nno oddity for him; he had sometimes borne a quietly-amused face in her\r\ncompany, but still it had seemed as if the pleasure her genial temper\r\nand radiant nature yielded him, could have been quite as naturally\r\nexpressed in a tear as in a smile. The completeness of his sympathy with\r\nher fancy for having a little John Harmon to protect and rear, he\r\nhad shown in every act and word, and now that the kind fancy was\r\ndisappointed, he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for\r\nwhich she could hardly thank him enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I do thank you, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and I thank you\r\nmost kindly. You love children.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope everybody does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They ought,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98but we don\xe2\x80\x99t all of us do what we ought,\r\ndo us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn Rokesmith replied, \xe2\x80\x98Some among us supply the short-comings of the\r\nrest. You have loved children well, Mr Boffin has told me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit better than he has, but that\xe2\x80\x99s his way; he puts all the good\r\nupon me. You speak rather sadly, Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It sounds to me so. Were you one of many children?\xe2\x80\x99 He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An only child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No there was another. Dead long ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father or mother alive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead.\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the rest of your relations?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead--if I ever had any living. I never heard of any.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this point of the dialogue Bella came in with a light step. She\r\npaused at the door a moment, hesitating whether to remain or retire;\r\nperplexed by finding that she was not observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t mind an old lady\xe2\x80\x99s talk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98but tell me. Are\r\nyou quite sure, Mr Rokesmith, that you have never had a disappointment\r\nin love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite sure. Why do you ask me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, for this reason. Sometimes you have a kind of kept-down manner\r\nwith you, which is not like your age. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be thirty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not yet thirty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDeeming it high time to make her presence known, Bella coughed here to\r\nattract attention, begged pardon, and said she would go, fearing that\r\nshe interrupted some matter of business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98because we are coming to business,\r\ninstead of having begun it, and you belong to it as much now, my dear\r\nBella, as I do. But I want my Noddy to consult with us. Would somebody\r\nbe so good as find my Noddy for me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRokesmith departed on that errand, and presently returned accompanied by\r\nMr Boffin at his jog-trot. Bella felt a little vague trepidation as to\r\nthe subject-matter of this same consultation, until Mrs Boffin announced\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you come and sit by me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said that worthy soul, taking\r\nher comfortable place on a large ottoman in the centre of the room,\r\nand drawing her arm through Bella\xe2\x80\x99s; \xe2\x80\x98and Noddy, you sit here, and Mr\r\nRokesmith you sit there. Now, you see, what I want to talk about, is\r\nthis. Mr and Mrs Milvey have sent me the kindest note possible (which\r\nMr Rokesmith just now read to me out aloud, for I ain\xe2\x80\x99t good at\r\nhandwritings), offering to find me another little child to name and\r\neducate and bring up. Well. This has set me thinking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98And she is a steam-ingein at it,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mr Boffin, in an admiring\r\nparenthesis, \xe2\x80\x98when she once begins. It mayn\xe2\x80\x99t be so easy to start her;\r\nbut once started, she\xe2\x80\x99s a ingein.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--This has set me thinking, I say,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Boffin, cordially\r\nbeaming under the influence of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s compliment, \xe2\x80\x98and I have\r\nthought two things. First of all, that I have grown timid of reviving\r\nJohn Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s name. It\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate name, and I fancy I should\r\nreproach myself if I gave it to another dear child, and it proved again\r\nunlucky.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, whether,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, gravely propounding a case for his\r\nSecretary\xe2\x80\x99s opinion; \xe2\x80\x98whether one might call that a superstition?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a matter of feeling with Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, gently.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The name has always been unfortunate. It has now this new unfortunate\r\nassociation connected with it. The name has died out. Why revive it?\r\nMight I ask Miss Wilfer what she thinks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has not been a fortunate name for me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, colouring--\xe2\x80\x98or\r\nat least it was not, until it led to my being here--but that is not the\r\npoint in my thoughts. As we had given the name to the poor child, and as\r\nthe poor child took so lovingly to me, I think I should feel jealous of\r\ncalling another child by it. I think I should feel as if the name had\r\nbecome endeared to me, and I had no right to use it so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion?\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Mr Boffin, observant of the\r\nSecretary\xe2\x80\x99s face and again addressing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say again, it is a matter of feeling,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthink Miss Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s feeling very womanly and pretty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, give us your opinion, Noddy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My opinion, old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Golden Dustman, \xe2\x80\x98is your opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98we agree not to revive John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s name, but\r\nto let it rest in the grave. It is, as Mr Rokesmith says, a matter of\r\nfeeling, but Lor how many matters ARE matters of feeling! Well; and so\r\nI come to the second thing I have thought of. You must know, Bella,\r\nmy dear, and Mr Rokesmith, that when I first named to my husband my\r\nthoughts of adopting a little orphan boy in remembrance of John Harmon,\r\nI further named to my husband that it was comforting to think that how\r\nthe poor boy would be benefited by John\xe2\x80\x99s own money, and protected from\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s own forlornness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98So she did. Ancoar!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not Ancoar, Noddy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98because I am\r\ngoing to say something else. I meant that, I am sure, as much as\r\nI still mean it. But this little death has made me ask myself the\r\nquestion, seriously, whether I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too bent upon pleasing myself.\r\nElse why did I seek out so much for a pretty child, and a child quite to\r\nmy liking? Wanting to do good, why not do it for its own sake, and put\r\nmy tastes and likings by?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; and perhaps she said it with some little\r\nsensitiveness arising out of those old curious relations of hers towards\r\nthe murdered man; \xe2\x80\x98perhaps, in reviving the name, you would not have\r\nliked to give it to a less interesting child than the original. He\r\ninterested you very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin, giving her a squeeze, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s kind\r\nof you to find that reason out, and I hope it may have been so, and\r\nindeed to a certain extent I believe it was so, but I am afraid not to\r\nthe whole extent. However, that don\xe2\x80\x99t come in question now, because we\r\nhave done with the name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laid it up as a remembrance,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella, musingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much better said, my dear; laid it up as a remembrance. Well then; I\r\nhave been thinking if I take any orphan to provide for, let it not be\r\na pet and a plaything for me, but a creature to be helped for its own\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not pretty then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin, stoutly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor prepossessing then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Not necessarily so. That\xe2\x80\x99s as it may happen.\r\nA well-disposed boy comes in my way who may be even a little wanting in\r\nsuch advantages for getting on in life, but is honest and industrious\r\nand requires a helping hand and deserves it. If I am very much in\r\nearnest and quite determined to be unselfish, let me take care of HIM.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the footman whose feelings had been hurt on the former occasion,\r\nappeared, and crossing to Rokesmith apologetically announced the\r\nobjectionable Sloppy.\r\n\r\nThe four members of Council looked at one another, and paused. \xe2\x80\x98Shall he\r\nbe brought here, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin. Whereupon the footman disappeared, reappeared\r\npresenting Sloppy, and retired much disgusted.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of Mrs Boffin had clothed Mr Sloppy in a suit of\r\nblack, on which the tailor had received personal directions from\r\nRokesmith to expend the utmost cunning of his art, with a view to the\r\nconcealment of the cohering and sustaining buttons. But, so much\r\nmore powerful were the frailties of Sloppy\xe2\x80\x99s form than the strongest\r\nresources of tailoring science, that he now stood before the Council,\r\na perfect Argus in the way of buttons: shining and winking and gleaming\r\nand twinkling out of a hundred of those eyes of bright metal, at the\r\ndazzled spectators. The artistic taste of some unknown hatter had\r\nfurnished him with a hatband of wholesale capacity which was fluted\r\nbehind, from the crown of his hat to the brim, and terminated in a black\r\nbunch, from which the imagination shrunk discomfited and the reason\r\nrevolted. Some special powers with which his legs were endowed, had\r\nalready hitched up his glossy trousers at the ankles, and bagged them at\r\nthe knees; while similar gifts in his arms had raised his coat-sleeves\r\nfrom his wrists and accumulated them at his elbows. Thus set forth, with\r\nthe additional embellishments of a very little tail to his coat, and a\r\nyawning gulf at his waistband, Sloppy stood confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how is Betty, my good fellow?\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Boffin asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, \xe2\x80\x98she do pretty nicely, and sending her\r\ndooty and many thanks for the tea and all faviours and wishing to know\r\nthe family\xe2\x80\x99s healths.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you just come, Sloppy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, mum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you have not had your dinner yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, mum. But I mean to it. For I ain\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten your handsome orders\r\nthat I was never to go away without having had a good \xe2\x80\x98un off of meat\r\nand beer and pudding--no: there was four of \xe2\x80\x98em, for I reckoned \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nup when I had \xe2\x80\x98em; meat one, beer two, vegetables three, and which was\r\nfour?--Why, pudding, HE was four!\xe2\x80\x99 Here Sloppy threw his head back,\r\nopened his mouth wide, and laughed rapturously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How are the two poor little Minders?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Striking right out, mum, and coming round beautiful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin looked on the other three members of Council, and then said,\r\nbeckoning with her finger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sloppy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, mum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come forward, Sloppy. Should you like to dine here every day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Off of all four on \xe2\x80\x98em, mum? O mum!\xe2\x80\x99 Sloppy\xe2\x80\x99s feelings obliged him to\r\nsqueeze his hat, and contract one leg at the knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. And should you like to be always taken care of here, if you were\r\nindustrious and deserving?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, mum!--But there\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Higden,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, checking himself in his\r\nraptures, drawing back, and shaking his head with very serious meaning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs Higden. Mrs Higden goes before all. None can ever be better\r\nfriends to me than Mrs Higden\xe2\x80\x99s been. And she must be turned for, must\r\nMrs Higden. Where would Mrs Higden be if she warn\xe2\x80\x99t turned for!\xe2\x80\x99 At the\r\nmere thought of Mrs Higden in this inconceivable affliction, Mr Sloppy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance became pale, and manifested the most distressful emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are as right as right can be, Sloppy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin \xe2\x80\x98and far be\r\nit from me to tell you otherwise. It shall be seen to. If Betty Higden\r\ncan be turned for all the same, you shall come here and be taken care of\r\nfor life, and be made able to keep her in other ways than the turning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even as to that, mum,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the ecstatic Sloppy, \xe2\x80\x98the turning might\r\nbe done in the night, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? I could be here in the day, and\r\nturn in the night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want no sleep, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Or even if I any ways\r\nshould want a wink or two,\xe2\x80\x99 added Sloppy, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s apologetic\r\nreflection, \xe2\x80\x98I could take \xe2\x80\x98em turning. I\xe2\x80\x99ve took \xe2\x80\x98em turning many a\r\ntime, and enjoyed \xe2\x80\x98em wonderful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the grateful impulse of the moment, Mr Sloppy kissed Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, and then detaching himself from that good creature that he might\r\nhave room enough for his feelings, threw back his head, opened his mouth\r\nwide, and uttered a dismal howl. It was creditable to his tenderness of\r\nheart, but suggested that he might on occasion give some offence to the\r\nneighbours: the rather, as the footman looked in, and begged pardon,\r\nfinding he was not wanted, but excused himself; on the ground \xe2\x80\x98that he\r\nthought it was Cats.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nSOME AFFAIRS OF THE HEART\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Miss Peecher, from her little official dwelling-house, with its\r\nlittle windows like the eyes in needles, and its little doors like the\r\ncovers of school-books, was very observant indeed of the object of her\r\nquiet affections. Love, though said to be afflicted with blindness, is\r\na vigilant watchman, and Miss Peecher kept him on double duty over Mr\r\nBradley Headstone. It was not that she was naturally given to playing\r\nthe spy--it was not that she was at all secret, plotting, or mean--it\r\nwas simply that she loved the irresponsive Bradley with all the\r\nprimitive and homely stock of love that had never been examined or\r\ncertificated out of her. If her faithful slate had had the latent\r\nqualities of sympathetic paper, and its pencil those of invisible ink,\r\nmany a little treatise calculated to astonish the pupils would have come\r\nbursting through the dry sums in school-time under the warming influence\r\nof Miss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. For, oftentimes when school was not, and her\r\ncalm leisure and calm little house were her own, Miss Peecher would\r\ncommit to the confidential slate an imaginary description of how, upon\r\na balmy evening at dusk, two figures might have been observed in the\r\nmarket-garden ground round the corner, of whom one, being a manly form,\r\nbent over the other, being a womanly form of short stature and some\r\ncompactness, and breathed in a low voice the words, \xe2\x80\x98Emma Peecher, wilt\r\nthou be my own?\xe2\x80\x99 after which the womanly form\xe2\x80\x99s head reposed upon the\r\nmanly form\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and the nightingales tuned up. Though all unseen,\r\nand unsuspected by the pupils, Bradley Headstone even pervaded the\r\nschool exercises. Was Geography in question? He would come triumphantly\r\nflying out of Vesuvius and Aetna ahead of the lava, and would boil\r\nunharmed in the hot springs of Iceland, and would float majestically\r\ndown the Ganges and the Nile. Did History chronicle a king of men?\r\nBehold him in pepper-and-salt pantaloons, with his watch-guard round\r\nhis neck. Were copies to be written? In capital B\xe2\x80\x99s and H\xe2\x80\x99s most of the\r\ngirls under Miss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s tuition were half a year ahead of every other\r\nletter in the alphabet. And Mental Arithmetic, administered by Miss\r\nPeecher, often devoted itself to providing Bradley Headstone with a\r\nwardrobe of fabulous extent: fourscore and four neck-ties at two and\r\nninepence-halfpenny, two gross of silver watches at four pounds fifteen\r\nand sixpence, seventy-four black hats at eighteen shillings; and many\r\nsimilar superfluities.\r\n\r\nThe vigilant watchman, using his daily opportunities of turning his eyes\r\nin Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s direction, soon apprized Miss Peecher that Bradley was more\r\npreoccupied than had been his wont, and more given to strolling about\r\nwith a downcast and reserved face, turning something difficult in his\r\nmind that was not in the scholastic syllabus. Putting this and that\r\ntogether--combining under the head \xe2\x80\x98this,\xe2\x80\x99 present appearances and the\r\nintimacy with Charley Hexam, and ranging under the head \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nvisit to his sister, the watchman reported to Miss Peecher his strong\r\nsuspicions that the sister was at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Peecher, as she sat making up her weekly report on\r\na half-holiday afternoon, \xe2\x80\x98what they call Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Anne, at her needlework, attendant and attentive, held her arm up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is named Lizzie, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She can hardly be named Lizzie, I think, Mary Anne,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss\r\nPeecher, in a tunefully instructive voice. \xe2\x80\x98Is Lizzie a Christian name,\r\nMary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Anne laid down her work, rose, hooked herself behind, as being\r\nunder catechization, and replied: \xe2\x80\x98No, it is a corruption, Miss\r\nPeecher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who gave her that name?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Peecher was going on, from the mere force\r\nof habit, when she checked herself; on Mary Anne\xe2\x80\x99s evincing theological\r\nimpatience to strike in with her godfathers and her godmothers, and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98I mean of what name is it a corruption?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elizabeth, or Eliza, Miss Peecher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right, Mary Anne. Whether there were any Lizzies in the early Christian\r\nChurch must be considered very doubtful, very doubtful.\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Peecher\r\nwas exceedingly sage here. \xe2\x80\x98Speaking correctly, we say, then, that\r\nHexam\xe2\x80\x99s sister is called Lizzie; not that she is named so. Do we not,\r\nMary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We do, Miss Peecher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Miss Peecher, complacent in her little transparent\r\nfiction of conducting the examination in a semiofficial manner for Mary\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, not her own, \xe2\x80\x98where does this young woman, who is called\r\nbut not named Lizzie, live? Think, now, before answering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Miss Peecher,\r\nas if possessed beforehand of the book in which it was written. Exactly\r\nso. And what occupation does this young woman pursue, Mary Anne? Take\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has a place of trust at an outfitter\xe2\x80\x99s in the City, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Peecher, pondering on it; but smoothly added, in a\r\nconfirmatory tone, \xe2\x80\x98At an outfitter\xe2\x80\x99s in the City. Ye-es?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Charley--\xe2\x80\x99 Mary Anne was proceeding, when Miss Peecher stared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean Hexam, Miss Peecher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think you did, Mary Anne. I am glad to hear you do. And\r\nHexam--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Says,\xe2\x80\x99 Mary Anne went on, \xe2\x80\x98that he is not pleased with his sister, and\r\nthat his sister won\xe2\x80\x99t be guided by his advice, and persists in being\r\nguided by somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s; and that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone coming across the garden!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Peecher, with a\r\nflushed glance at the looking-glass. \xe2\x80\x98You have answered very well, Mary\r\nAnne. You are forming an excellent habit of arranging your thoughts\r\nclearly. That will do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe discreet Mary Anne resumed her seat and her silence, and stitched,\r\nand stitched, and was stitching when the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s shadow came in\r\nbefore him, announcing that he might be instantly expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, Miss Peecher,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, pursuing the shadow, and taking\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, Mr Headstone. Mary Anne, a chair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, seating himself in his constrained manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is but a flying visit. I have looked in, on my way, to ask a\r\nkindness of you as a neighbour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you say on your way, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Peecher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On my way to--where I am going.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Miss Peecher, in\r\nher own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley Hexam has gone to get a book or two he wants, and will probably\r\nbe back before me. As we leave my house empty, I took the liberty of\r\ntelling him I would leave the key here. Would you kindly allow me to do\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Mr Headstone. Going for an evening walk, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partly for a walk, and partly for--on business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Business in Church Street, Smith Square, by Mill Bank,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Miss\r\nPeecher to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having said which,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bradley, laying his door-key on the table,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must be already going. There is nothing I can do for you, Miss\r\nPeecher?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Mr Headstone. In which direction?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the direction of Westminster.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mill Bank,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Peecher repeated in her own thoughts once again. \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nthank you, Mr Headstone; I\xe2\x80\x99ll not trouble you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Peecher, though not aloud; \xe2\x80\x98but you can trouble\r\nME!\xe2\x80\x99 And for all her quiet manner, and her quiet smile, she was full of\r\ntrouble as he went his way.\r\n\r\nShe was right touching his destination. He held as straight a course\r\nfor the house of the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker as the wisdom of his ancestors,\r\nexemplified in the construction of the intervening streets, would let\r\nhim, and walked with a bent head hammering at one fixed idea. It had\r\nbeen an immoveable idea since he first set eyes upon her. It seemed to\r\nhim as if all that he could suppress in himself he had suppressed, as\r\nif all that he could restrain in himself he had restrained, and the time\r\nhad come--in a rush, in a moment--when the power of self-command had\r\ndeparted from him. Love at first sight is a trite expression quite\r\nsufficiently discussed; enough that in certain smouldering natures like\r\nthis man\xe2\x80\x99s, that passion leaps into a blaze, and makes such head as fire\r\ndoes in a rage of wind, when other passions, but for its mastery, could\r\nbe held in chains. As a multitude of weak, imitative natures are\r\nalways lying by, ready to go mad upon the next wrong idea that may be\r\nbroached--in these times, generally some form of tribute to Somebody\r\nfor something that never was done, or, if ever done, that was done by\r\nSomebody Else--so these less ordinary natures may lie by for years,\r\nready on the touch of an instant to burst into flame.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster went his way, brooding and brooding, and a sense of\r\nbeing vanquished in a struggle might have been pieced out of his worried\r\nface. Truly, in his breast there lingered a resentful shame to find\r\nhimself defeated by this passion for Charley Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s sister, though in\r\nthe very self-same moments he was concentrating himself upon the object\r\nof bringing the passion to a successful issue.\r\n\r\nHe appeared before the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, sitting alone at her work.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oho!\xe2\x80\x99 thought that sharp young personage, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it? I know your\r\ntricks and your manners, my friend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone, \xe2\x80\x98is not come home yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite a conjuror,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will wait, if you please, for I want to speak to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Sit down. I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s mutual.\xe2\x80\x99 Bradley\r\nglanced distrustfully at the shrewd face again bending over the work,\r\nand said, trying to conquer doubt and hesitation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t imply that my visit will be unacceptable to Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There! Don\xe2\x80\x99t call her that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear you to call her that,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreturned Miss Wren, snapping her fingers in a volley of impatient snaps,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98for I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Wren wrinkled her nose, to express dislike. \xe2\x80\x98Selfish. Thinks\r\nonly of himself. The way with all of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The way with all of us? Then you don\xe2\x80\x99t like ME?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So-so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren, with a shrug and a laugh. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t know much\r\nabout you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I was not aware it was the way with all of us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley,\r\nreturning to the accusation, a little injured. \xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you say, some of\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meaning,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the little creature, \xe2\x80\x98every one of you, but you.\r\nHah! Now look this lady in the face. This is Mrs Truth. The Honourable.\r\nFull-dressed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley glanced at the doll she held up for his observation--which had\r\nbeen lying on its face on her bench, while with a needle and thread she\r\nfastened the dress on at the back--and looked from it to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I stand the Honourable Mrs T. on my bench in this corner against the\r\nwall, where her blue eyes can shine upon you,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Miss Wren, doing\r\nso, and making two little dabs at him in the air with her needle, as\r\nif she pricked him with it in his own eyes; \xe2\x80\x98and I defy you to tell me,\r\nwith Mrs T. for a witness, what you have come here for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To see Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Miss Wren, hitching her chin. \xe2\x80\x98But on whose\r\naccount?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Mrs T.!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98You hear him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To reason with her,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bradley, half humouring what was present,\r\nand half angry with what was not present; \xe2\x80\x98for her own sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh Mrs T.!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For her own sake,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bradley, warming, \xe2\x80\x98and for her brother\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand as a perfectly disinterested person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, Mrs T.,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the dressmaker, \xe2\x80\x98since it comes to this, we\r\nmust positively turn you with your face to the wall.\xe2\x80\x99 She had hardly\r\ndone so, when Lizzie Hexam arrived, and showed some surprise on seeing\r\nBradley Headstone there, and Jenny shaking her little fist at him close\r\nbefore her eyes, and the Honourable Mrs T. with her face to the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly disinterested person, Lizzie dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the knowing\r\nMiss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98come to talk with you, for your own sake and your brother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThink of that. I am sure there ought to be no third party present at\r\nanything so very kind and so very serious; and so, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll remove the\r\nthird party upstairs, my dear, the third party will retire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie took the hand which the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker held out to her for\r\nthe purpose of being supported away, but only looked at her with an\r\ninquiring smile, and made no other movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The third party hobbles awfully, you know, when she\xe2\x80\x99s left to herself;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98her back being so bad, and her legs so queer; so she\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t retire gracefully unless you help her, Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She can do no better than stay where she is,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie,\r\nreleasing the hand, and laying her own lightly on Miss Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s curls.\r\nAnd then to Bradley: \xe2\x80\x98From Charley, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn an irresolute way, and stealing a clumsy look at her, Bradley rose to\r\nplace a chair for her, and then returned to his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Strictly speaking,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I come from Charley, because I left him\r\nonly a little while ago; but I am not commissioned by Charley. I come of\r\nmy own spontaneous act.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith her elbows on her bench, and her chin upon her hands, Miss Jenny\r\nWren sat looking at him with a watchful sidelong look. Lizzie, in her\r\ndifferent way, sat looking at him too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 began Bradley, with a mouth so dry that he had some\r\ndifficulty in articulating his words: the consciousness of which\r\nrendered his manner still more ungainly and undecided; \xe2\x80\x98the truth is,\r\nthat Charley, having no secrets from me (to the best of my belief), has\r\nconfided the whole of this matter to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe came to a stop, and Lizzie asked: \xe2\x80\x98what matter, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the schoolmaster, stealing another look at her,\r\nand seeming to try in vain to sustain it; for the look dropped as it\r\nlighted on her eyes, \xe2\x80\x98that it might be so superfluous as to be almost\r\nimpertinent, to enter upon a definition of it. My allusion was to this\r\nmatter of your having put aside your brother\xe2\x80\x99s plans for you, and\r\ngiven the preference to those of Mr--I believe the name is Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made this point of not being certain of the name, with another uneasy\r\nlook at her, which dropped like the last.\r\n\r\nNothing being said on the other side, he had to begin again, and began\r\nwith new embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your brother\xe2\x80\x99s plans were communicated to me when he first had them in\r\nhis thoughts. In point of fact he spoke to me about them when I was\r\nlast here--when we were walking back together, and when I--when the\r\nimpression was fresh upon me of having seen his sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere might have been no meaning in it, but the little dressmaker here\r\nremoved one of her supporting hands from her chin, and musingly turned\r\nthe Honourable Mrs T. with her face to the company. That done, she fell\r\ninto her former attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I approved of his idea,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, with his uneasy look wandering\r\nto the doll, and unconsciously resting there longer than it had\r\nrested on Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98both because your brother ought naturally to be the\r\noriginator of any such scheme, and because I hoped to be able to promote\r\nit. I should have had inexpressible pleasure, I should have taken\r\ninexpressible interest, in promoting it. Therefore I must acknowledge\r\nthat when your brother was disappointed, I too was disappointed. I wish\r\nto avoid reservation or concealment, and I fully acknowledge that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe appeared to have encouraged himself by having got so far. At all\r\nevents he went on with much greater firmness and force of emphasis:\r\nthough with a curious disposition to set his teeth, and with a curious\r\ntight-screwing movement of his right hand in the clenching palm of his\r\nleft, like the action of one who was being physically hurt, and was\r\nunwilling to cry out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a man of strong feelings, and I have strongly felt this\r\ndisappointment. I do strongly feel it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t show what I feel; some\r\nof us are obliged habitually to keep it down. To keep it down. But to\r\nreturn to your brother. He has taken the matter so much to heart that\r\nhe has remonstrated (in my presence he remonstrated) with Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn, if that be the name. He did so, quite ineffectually. As any\r\none not blinded to the real character of Mr--Mr Eugene Wrayburn--would\r\nreadily suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at Lizzie again, and held the look. And his face turned from\r\nburning red to white, and from white back to burning red, and so for the\r\ntime to lasting deadly white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Finally, I resolved to come here alone, and appeal to you. I resolved\r\nto come here alone, and entreat you to retract the course you have\r\nchosen, and instead of confiding in a mere stranger--a person of most\r\ninsolent behaviour to your brother and others--to prefer your brother\r\nand your brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie Hexam had changed colour when those changes came over him, and\r\nher face now expressed some anger, more dislike, and even a touch of\r\nfear. But she answered him very steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot doubt, Mr Headstone, that your visit is well meant. You have\r\nbeen so good a friend to Charley that I have no right to doubt it. I\r\nhave nothing to tell Charley, but that I accepted the help to which he\r\nso much objects before he made any plans for me; or certainly before I\r\nknew of any. It was considerately and delicately offered, and there were\r\nreasons that had weight with me which should be as dear to Charley as to\r\nme. I have no more to say to Charley on this subject.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis lips trembled and stood apart, as he followed this repudiation of\r\nhimself; and limitation of her words to her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have told Charley, if he had come to me,\xe2\x80\x99 she resumed, as\r\nthough it were an after-thought, \xe2\x80\x98that Jenny and I find our teacher very\r\nable and very patient, and that she takes great pains with us. So much\r\nso, that we have said to her we hope in a very little while to be able\r\nto go on by ourselves. Charley knows about teachers, and I should also\r\nhave told him, for his satisfaction, that ours comes from an institution\r\nwhere teachers are regularly brought up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to ask you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone, grinding his words\r\nslowly out, as though they came from a rusty mill; \xe2\x80\x98I should like to\r\nask you, if I may without offence, whether you would have objected--no;\r\nrather, I should like to say, if I may without offence, that I wish I\r\nhad had the opportunity of coming here with your brother and devoting my\r\npoor abilities and experience to your service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Mr Headstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I fear,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued, after a pause, furtively wrenching at the seat\r\nof his chair with one hand, as if he would have wrenched the chair to\r\npieces, and gloomily observing her while her eyes were cast down, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nmy humble services would not have found much favour with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, and the poor stricken wretch sat contending with\r\nhimself in a heat of passion and torment. After a while he took out his\r\nhandkerchief and wiped his forehead and hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is only one thing more I had to say, but it is the most\r\nimportant. There is a reason against this matter, there is a personal\r\nrelation concerned in this matter, not yet explained to you. It might--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say it would--it might--induce you to think differently. To\r\nproceed under the present circumstances is out of the question. Will you\r\nplease come to the understanding that there shall be another interview\r\non the subject?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With Charley, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With--well,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, breaking off, \xe2\x80\x98yes! Say with him too.\r\nWill you please come to the understanding that there must be another\r\ninterview under more favourable circumstances, before the whole case can\r\nbe submitted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, shaking her head, \xe2\x80\x98understand your meaning, Mr\r\nHeadstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Limit my meaning for the present,\xe2\x80\x99 he interrupted, \xe2\x80\x98to the whole case\r\nbeing submitted to you in another interview.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What case, Mr Headstone? What is wanting to it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--you shall be informed in the other interview.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he said, as\r\nif in a burst of irrepressible despair, \xe2\x80\x98I--I leave it all incomplete!\r\nThere is a spell upon me, I think!\xe2\x80\x99 And then added, almost as if he\r\nasked for pity, \xe2\x80\x98Good-night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand. As she, with manifest hesitation, not to say\r\nreluctance, touched it, a strange tremble passed over him, and his face,\r\nso deadly white, was moved as by a stroke of pain. Then he was gone.\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker sat with her attitude unchanged, eyeing the door\r\nby which he had departed, until Lizzie pushed her bench aside and sat\r\ndown near her. Then, eyeing Lizzie as she had previously eyed Bradley\r\nand the door, Miss Wren chopped that very sudden and keen chop in which\r\nher jaws sometimes indulged, leaned back in her chair with folded arms,\r\nand thus expressed herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humph! If he--I mean, of course, my dear, the party who is coming to\r\ncourt me when the time comes--should be THAT sort of man, he may spare\r\nhimself the trouble. HE wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to be trotted about and made useful.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d take fire and blow up while he was about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so you would be rid of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, humouring her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so easily,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blow up alone. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ncarry me up with him. I know his tricks and his manners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would he want to hurt you, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mightn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly want to do it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren; \xe2\x80\x98but a\r\nlot of gunpowder among lighted lucifer-matches in the next room might\r\nalmost as well be here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a very strange man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish he was so very strange a man as to be a total stranger,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanswered the sharp little thing.\r\n\r\nIt being Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s regular occupation when they were alone of an evening\r\nto brush out and smooth the long fair hair of the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, she\r\nunfastened a ribbon that kept it back while the little creature was at\r\nher work, and it fell in a beautiful shower over the poor shoulders that\r\nwere much in need of such adorning rain. \xe2\x80\x98Not now, Lizzie, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nJenny; \xe2\x80\x98let us have a talk by the fire.\xe2\x80\x99 With those words, she in her\r\nturn loosened her friend\xe2\x80\x99s dark hair, and it dropped of its own weight\r\nover her bosom, in two rich masses. Pretending to compare the colours\r\nand admire the contrast, Jenny so managed a mere touch or two of her\r\nnimble hands, as that she herself laying a cheek on one of the dark\r\nfolds, seemed blinded by her own clustering curls to all but the fire,\r\nwhile the fine handsome face and brow of Lizzie were revealed without\r\nobstruction in the sombre light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us have a talk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny, \xe2\x80\x98about Mr Eugene Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething sparkled down among the fair hair resting on the dark hair;\r\nand if it were not a star--which it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be--it was an eye; and\r\nif it were an eye, it was Jenny Wren\xe2\x80\x99s eye, bright and watchful as the\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s whose name she had taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why about Mr Wrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99 Lizzie asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For no better reason than because I\xe2\x80\x99m in the humour. I wonder whether\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s rich!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not rich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so, for a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! To be sure! Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman. Not of our sort; is he?\xe2\x80\x99 A shake\r\nof the head, a thoughtful shake of the head, and the answer, softly\r\nspoken, \xe2\x80\x98Oh no, oh no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker had an arm round her friend\xe2\x80\x99s waist. Adjusting the\r\narm, she slyly took the opportunity of blowing at her own hair where\r\nit fell over her face; then the eye down there, under lighter shadows\r\nsparkled more brightly and appeared more watchful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When He turns up, he shan\xe2\x80\x99t be a gentleman; I\xe2\x80\x99ll very soon send him\r\npacking, if he is. However, he\xe2\x80\x99s not Mr Wrayburn; I haven\xe2\x80\x99t captivated\r\nHIM. I wonder whether anybody has, Lizzie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very likely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it very likely? I wonder who!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not very likely that some lady has been taken by him, and that he\r\nmay love her dearly?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What would you think of him, Lizzie, if you were\r\na lady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I a lady!\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98Such a fancy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. But say: just as a fancy, and for instance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I a lady! I, a poor girl who used to row poor father on the river. I,\r\nwho had rowed poor father out and home on the very night when I saw him\r\nfor the first time. I, who was made so timid by his looking at me, that\r\nI got up and went out!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98He did look at you, even that night, though you were not a lady!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought Miss Wren.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I a lady!\xe2\x80\x99 Lizzie went on in a low voice, with her eyes upon the fire.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, with poor father\xe2\x80\x99s grave not even cleared of undeserved stain and\r\nshame, and he trying to clear it for me! I a lady!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only as a fancy, and for instance,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too much, Jenny, dear, too much! My fancy is not able to get that far.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAs the low fire gleamed upon her, it showed her smiling, mournfully and\r\nabstractedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am in the humour, and I must be humoured, Lizzie, because after\r\nall I am a poor little thing, and have had a hard day with my bad child.\r\nLook in the fire, as I like to hear you tell how you used to do when you\r\nlived in that dreary old house that had once been a windmill. Look in\r\nthe--what was its name when you told fortunes with your brother that I\r\nDON\xe2\x80\x99T like?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The hollow down by the flare?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! That\xe2\x80\x99s the name! You can find a lady there, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More easily than I can make one of such material as myself, Jenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sparkling eye looked steadfastly up, as the musing face looked\r\nthoughtfully down. \xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, \xe2\x80\x98We have found\r\nour lady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie nodded, and asked, \xe2\x80\x98Shall she be rich?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She had better be, as he\xe2\x80\x99s poor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very rich. Shall she be handsome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even you can be that, Lizzie, so she ought to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very handsome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does she say about him?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Jenny, in a low voice:\r\nwatchful, through an intervening silence, of the face looking down at\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is glad, glad, to be rich, that he may have the money. She is glad,\r\nglad, to be beautiful, that he may be proud of her. Her poor heart--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? Her poor heart?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her heart--is given him, with all its love and truth. She would\r\njoyfully die with him, or, better than that, die for him. She knows he\r\nhas failings, but she thinks they have grown up through his being like\r\none cast away, for the want of something to trust in, and care for, and\r\nthink well of. And she says, that lady rich and beautiful that I can\r\nnever come near, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly put me in that empty place, only try how little\r\nI mind myself, only prove what a world of things I will do and bear for\r\nyou, and I hope that you might even come to be much better than you are,\r\nthrough me who am so much worse, and hardly worth the thinking of beside\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the face looking at the fire had become exalted and forgetful in the\r\nrapture of these words, the little creature, openly clearing away\r\nher fair hair with her disengaged hand, had gazed at it with earnest\r\nattention and something like alarm. Now that the speaker ceased, the\r\nlittle creature laid down her head again, and moaned, \xe2\x80\x98O me, O me, O\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In pain, dear Jenny?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lizzie, as if awakened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but not the old pain. Lay me down, lay me down. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go out of\r\nmy sight to-night. Lock the door and keep close to me.\xe2\x80\x99 Then turning away\r\nher face, she said in a whisper to herself, \xe2\x80\x98My Lizzie, my poor Lizzie!\r\nO my blessed children, come back in the long bright slanting rows, and\r\ncome for her, not me. She wants help more than I, my blessed children!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had stretched her hands up with that higher and better look, and\r\nnow she turned again, and folded them round Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and rocked\r\nherself on Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nMORE BIRDS OF PREY\r\n\r\n\r\nRogue Riderhood dwelt deep and dark in Limehouse Hole, among the\r\nriggers, and the mast, oar and block makers, and the boat-builders, and\r\nthe sail-lofts, as in a kind of ship\xe2\x80\x99s hold stored full of waterside\r\ncharacters, some no better than himself, some very much better, and\r\nnone much worse. The Hole, albeit in a general way not over nice in\r\nits choice of company, was rather shy in reference to the honour of\r\ncultivating the Rogue\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance; more frequently giving him the\r\ncold shoulder than the warm hand, and seldom or never drinking with him\r\nunless at his own expense. A part of the Hole, indeed, contained so\r\nmuch public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage\r\ncould move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser. But, there may\r\nhave been the drawback on this magnanimous morality, that its exponents\r\nheld a true witness before Justice to be the next unneighbourly and\r\naccursed character to a false one.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the daughter whom he often mentioned, Mr Riderhood\r\nmight have found the Hole a mere grave as to any means it would yield\r\nhim of getting a living. But Miss Pleasant Riderhood had some little\r\nposition and connection in Limehouse Hole. Upon the smallest of small\r\nscales, she was an unlicensed pawnbroker, keeping what was popularly\r\ncalled a Leaving Shop, by lending insignificant sums on insignificant\r\narticles of property deposited with her as security. In her\r\nfour-and-twentieth year of life, Pleasant was already in her fifth year\r\nof this way of trade. Her deceased mother had established the business,\r\nand on that parent\xe2\x80\x99s demise she had appropriated a secret capital of\r\nfifteen shillings to establishing herself in it; the existence of\r\nsuch capital in a pillow being the last intelligible confidential\r\ncommunication made to her by the departed, before succumbing to\r\ndropsical conditions of snuff and gin, incompatible equally with\r\ncoherence and existence.\r\n\r\nWhy christened Pleasant, the late Mrs Riderhood might possibly have\r\nbeen at some time able to explain, and possibly not. Her daughter had no\r\ninformation on that point. Pleasant she found herself, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it. She had not been consulted on the question, any more than on\r\nthe question of her coming into these terrestrial parts, to want a name.\r\nSimilarly, she found herself possessed of what is colloquially termed\r\na swivel eye (derived from her father), which she might perhaps have\r\ndeclined if her sentiments on the subject had been taken. She was not\r\notherwise positively ill-looking, though anxious, meagre, of a muddy\r\ncomplexion, and looking as old again as she really was.\r\n\r\nAs some dogs have it in the blood, or are trained, to worry certain\r\ncreatures to a certain point, so--not to make the comparison\r\ndisrespectfully--Pleasant Riderhood had it in the blood, or had been\r\ntrained, to regard seamen, within certain limits, as her prey. Show\r\nher a man in a blue jacket, and, figuratively speaking, she pinned him\r\ninstantly. Yet, all things considered, she was not of an evil mind or an\r\nunkindly disposition. For, observe how many things were to be considered\r\naccording to her own unfortunate experience. Show Pleasant Riderhood a\r\nWedding in the street, and she only saw two people taking out a regular\r\nlicence to quarrel and fight. Show her a Christening, and she saw a\r\nlittle heathen personage having a quite superfluous name bestowed upon\r\nit, inasmuch as it would be commonly addressed by some abusive epithet:\r\nwhich little personage was not in the least wanted by anybody, and would\r\nbe shoved and banged out of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s way, until it should grow\r\nbig enough to shove and bang. Show her a Funeral, and she saw an\r\nunremunerative ceremony in the nature of a black masquerade, conferring\r\na temporary gentility on the performers, at an immense expense, and\r\nrepresenting the only formal party ever given by the deceased. Show her\r\na live father, and she saw but a duplicate of her own father, who from\r\nher infancy had been taken with fits and starts of discharging his duty\r\nto her, which duty was always incorporated in the form of a fist or a\r\nleathern strap, and being discharged hurt her. All things considered,\r\ntherefore, Pleasant Riderhood was not so very, very bad. There was even\r\na touch of romance in her--of such romance as could creep into Limehouse\r\nHole--and maybe sometimes of a summer evening, when she stood with\r\nfolded arms at her shop-door, looking from the reeking street to the\r\nsky where the sun was setting, she may have had some vaporous visions\r\nof far-off islands in the southern seas or elsewhere (not being\r\ngeographically particular), where it would be good to roam with a\r\ncongenial partner among groves of bread-fruit, waiting for ships to be\r\nwafted from the hollow ports of civilization. For, sailors to be got the\r\nbetter of, were essential to Miss Pleasant\xe2\x80\x99s Eden.\r\n\r\nNot on a summer evening did she come to her little shop-door, when a\r\ncertain man standing over against the house on the opposite side of\r\nthe street took notice of her. That was on a cold shrewd windy evening,\r\nafter dark. Pleasant Riderhood shared with most of the lady inhabitants\r\nof the Hole, the peculiarity that her hair was a ragged knot, constantly\r\ncoming down behind, and that she never could enter upon any undertaking\r\nwithout first twisting it into place. At that particular moment, being\r\nnewly come to the threshold to take a look out of doors, she was winding\r\nherself up with both hands after this fashion. And so prevalent was the\r\nfashion, that on the occasion of a fight or other disturbance in the\r\nHole, the ladies would be seen flocking from all quarters universally\r\ntwisting their back-hair as they came along, and many of them, in the\r\nhurry of the moment, carrying their back-combs in their mouths.\r\n\r\nIt was a wretched little shop, with a roof that any man standing in it\r\ncould touch with his hand; little better than a cellar or cave, down\r\nthree steps. Yet in its ill-lighted window, among a flaring handkerchief\r\nor two, an old peacoat or so, a few valueless watches and compasses, a\r\njar of tobacco and two crossed pipes, a bottle of walnut ketchup, and\r\nsome horrible sweets these creature discomforts serving as a blind to\r\nthe main business of the Leaving Shop--was displayed the inscription\r\nSEAMAN\xe2\x80\x99S BOARDING-HOUSE.\r\n\r\nTaking notice of Pleasant Riderhood at the door, the man crossed so\r\nquickly that she was still winding herself up, when he stood close\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is your father at home?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think he is,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Pleasant, dropping her arms; \xe2\x80\x98come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a tentative reply, the man having a seafaring appearance. Her\r\nfather was not at home, and Pleasant knew it. \xe2\x80\x98Take a seat by the fire,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwere her hospitable words when she had got him in; \xe2\x80\x98men of your calling\r\nare always welcome here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\nHis manner was the manner of a sailor, and his hands were the hands of\r\na sailor, except that they were smooth. Pleasant had an eye for sailors,\r\nand she noticed the unused colour and texture of the hands, sunburnt\r\nthough they were, as sharply as she noticed their unmistakable looseness\r\nand suppleness, as he sat himself down with his left arm carelessly\r\nthrown across his left leg a little above the knee, and the right arm\r\nas carelessly thrown over the elbow of the wooden chair, with the hand\r\ncurved, half open and half shut, as if it had just let go a rope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might you be looking for a Boarding-House?\xe2\x80\x99 Pleasant inquired, taking\r\nher observant stand on one side of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know my plans yet,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ain\xe2\x80\x99t looking for a Leaving Shop?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Pleasant, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ve got too much of an outfit on you for\r\nthat. But if you should want either, this is both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay!\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, glancing round the place. \xe2\x80\x98I know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nhere before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you Leave anything when you were here before?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Pleasant, with\r\na view to principal and interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 The man shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am pretty sure you never boarded here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 The man again shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What DID you do here when you were here before?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Pleasant. \xe2\x80\x98For I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not at all likely you should. I only stood at the door, one\r\nnight--on the lower step there--while a shipmate of mine looked in to\r\nspeak to your father. I remember the place well.\xe2\x80\x99 Looking very curiously\r\nround it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might that have been long ago?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, a goodish bit ago. When I came off my last voyage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you have not been to sea lately?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Been in the sick bay since then, and been employed ashore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, to be sure, that accounts for your hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man with a keen look, a quick smile, and a change of manner, caught\r\nher up. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a good observer. Yes. That accounts for my hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPleasant was somewhat disquieted by his look, and returned it\r\nsuspiciously. Not only was his change of manner, though very sudden,\r\nquite collected, but his former manner, which he resumed, had a\r\ncertain suppressed confidence and sense of power in it that were half\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will your father be long?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you supposed he was at home, it would seem that he has just gone\r\nout? How\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I supposed he had come home,\xe2\x80\x99 Pleasant explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! You supposed he had come home? Then he has been some time out?\r\nHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to deceive you. Father\xe2\x80\x99s on the river in his boat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the old work?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pleasant, shrinking a step back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What on earth d\xe2\x80\x99ye want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt your father. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say I might, if I\r\nchose. I want to speak to him. Not much in that, is there? There shall\r\nbe no secrets from you; you shall be by. And plainly, Miss Riderhood,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be got out of me, or made of me. I am not good for\r\nthe Leaving Shop, I am not good for the Boarding-House, I am not good\r\nfor anything in your way to the extent of sixpenn\xe2\x80\x99orth of halfpence. Put\r\nthe idea aside, and we shall get on together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you\xe2\x80\x99re a seafaring man?\xe2\x80\x99 argued Pleasant, as if that were a\r\nsufficient reason for his being good for something in her way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes and no. I have been, and I may be again. But I am not for you.\r\nWon\xe2\x80\x99t you take my word for it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe conversation had arrived at a crisis to justify Miss Pleasant\xe2\x80\x99s hair\r\nin tumbling down. It tumbled down accordingly, and she twisted it up,\r\nlooking from under her bent forehead at the man. In taking stock of his\r\nfamiliarly worn rough-weather nautical clothes, piece by piece, she took\r\nstock of a formidable knife in a sheath at his waist ready to his hand,\r\nand of a whistle hanging round his neck, and of a short jagged knotted\r\nclub with a loaded head that peeped out of a pocket of his loose\r\nouter jacket or frock. He sat quietly looking at her; but, with these\r\nappendages partially revealing themselves, and with a quantity\r\nof bristling oakum-coloured head and whisker, he had a formidable\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you take my word for it?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked again.\r\n\r\nPleasant answered with a short dumb nod. He rejoined with another short\r\ndumb nod. Then he got up and stood with his arms folded, in front of\r\nthe fire, looking down into it occasionally, as she stood with her arms\r\nfolded, leaning against the side of the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To wile away the time till your father comes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,--\xe2\x80\x98pray is there\r\nmuch robbing and murdering of seamen about the water-side now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Complaints of that sort are sometimes made, about Ratcliffe and Wapping\r\nand up that way. But who knows how many are true?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure. And it don\xe2\x80\x99t seem necessary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what I say,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Pleasant. \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for it?\r\nBless the sailors, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t as if they ever could keep what they have,\r\nwithout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re right. Their money may be soon got out of them, without\r\nviolence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it may,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pleasant; \xe2\x80\x98and then they ship again and get\r\nmore. And the best thing for \xe2\x80\x98em, too, to ship again as soon as ever\r\nthey can be brought to it. They\xe2\x80\x99re never so well off as when they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nafloat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why I ask,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the visitor, looking up from the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x98I was once beset that way myself, and left for dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99 said Pleasant. \xe2\x80\x98Where did it happen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It happened,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man, with a ruminative air, as he drew his\r\nright hand across his chin, and dipped the other in the pocket of his\r\nrough outer coat, \xe2\x80\x98it happened somewhere about here as I reckon. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink it can have been a mile from here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you drunk?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was muddled, but not with fair drinking. I had not been drinking, you\r\nunderstand. A mouthful did it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPleasant with a grave look shook her head; importing that she understood\r\nthe process, but decidedly disapproved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fair trade is one thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98but that\xe2\x80\x99s another. No one has a\r\nright to carry on with Jack in THAT way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sentiment does you credit,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man, with a grim smile;\r\nand added, in a mutter, \xe2\x80\x98the more so, as I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s not your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s.--Yes, I had a bad time of it, that time. I lost everything,\r\nand had a sharp struggle for my life, weak as I was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you get the parties punished?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A tremendous punishment followed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, more seriously; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nit was not of my bringing about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of whose, then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe man pointed upward with his forefinger, and, slowly recovering that\r\nhand, settled his chin in it again as he looked at the fire. Bringing\r\nher inherited eye to bear upon him, Pleasant Riderhood felt more\r\nand more uncomfortable, his manner was so mysterious, so stern, so\r\nself-possessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anyways,\xe2\x80\x99 said the damsel, \xe2\x80\x98I am glad punishment followed, and I say\r\nso. Fair trade with seafaring men gets a bad name through deeds of\r\nviolence. I am as much against deeds of violence being done to seafaring\r\nmen, as seafaring men can be themselves. I am of the same opinion as my\r\nmother was, when she was living. Fair trade, my mother used to say, but\r\nno robbery and no blows.\xe2\x80\x99 In the way of trade Miss Pleasant would have\r\ntaken--and indeed did take when she could--as much as thirty shillings\r\na week for board that would be dear at five, and likewise conducted the\r\nLeaving business upon correspondingly equitable principles; yet she had\r\nthat tenderness of conscience and those feelings of humanity, that the\r\nmoment her ideas of trade were overstepped, she became the seaman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchampion, even against her father whom she seldom otherwise resisted.\r\n\r\nBut, she was here interrupted by her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice exclaiming angrily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Poll Parrot!\xe2\x80\x99 and by her father\xe2\x80\x99s hat being heavily flung from his\r\nhand and striking her face. Accustomed to such occasional manifestations\r\nof his sense of parental duty, Pleasant merely wiped her face on her\r\nhair (which of course had tumbled down) before she twisted it up. This\r\nwas another common procedure on the part of the ladies of the Hole, when\r\nheated by verbal or fistic altercation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blest if I believe such a Poll Parrot as you was ever learned to\r\nspeak!\xe2\x80\x99 growled Mr Riderhood, stooping to pick up his hat, and making\r\na feint at her with his head and right elbow; for he took the delicate\r\nsubject of robbing seamen in extraordinary dudgeon, and was out of\r\nhumour too. \xe2\x80\x98What are you Poll Parroting at now? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you got nothing\r\nto do but fold your arms and stand a Poll Parroting all night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let her alone,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the man. \xe2\x80\x98She was only speaking to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let her alone too!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Riderhood, eyeing him all over. \xe2\x80\x98Do you\r\nknow she\xe2\x80\x99s my daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I won\xe2\x80\x99t have no Poll Parroting on the part of\r\nmy daughter? No, nor yet that I won\xe2\x80\x99t take no Poll Parroting from no\r\nman? And who may YOU be, and what may YOU want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I tell you until you are silent?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood, quailing a little, \xe2\x80\x98I am willing to be silent\r\nfor the purpose of hearing. But don\xe2\x80\x99t Poll Parrot me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you thirsty, you?\xe2\x80\x99 the man asked, in the same fierce short way,\r\nafter returning his look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why nat\xe2\x80\x99rally,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98ain\xe2\x80\x99t I always thirsty!\xe2\x80\x99 (Indignant\r\nat the absurdity of the question.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will you drink?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sherry wine,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Riderhood, in the same sharp tone, \xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncapable of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man put his hand in his pocket, took out half a sovereign, and\r\nbegged the favour of Miss Pleasant that she would fetch a bottle. \xe2\x80\x98With\r\nthe cork undrawn,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, emphatically, looking at her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my Alfred David,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Mr Riderhood, slowly relaxing into\r\na dark smile, \xe2\x80\x98that you know a move. Do I know YOU? N--n--no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man replied, \xe2\x80\x98No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know me.\xe2\x80\x99 And so they stood looking at\r\none another surlily enough, until Pleasant came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s small glasses on the shelf,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood to his daughter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me the one without a foot. I gets my living by the sweat of my\r\nbrow, and it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for ME.\xe2\x80\x99 This had a modest self-denying\r\nappearance; but it soon turned out that as, by reason of the\r\nimpossibility of standing the glass upright while there was anything in\r\nit, it required to be emptied as soon as filled, Mr Riderhood managed to\r\ndrink in the proportion of three to one.\r\n\r\nWith his Fortunatus\xe2\x80\x99s goblet ready in his hand, Mr Riderhood sat down on\r\none side of the table before the fire, and the strange man on the other:\r\nPleasant occupying a stool between the latter and the fireside. The\r\nbackground, composed of handkerchiefs, coats, shirts, hats, and other\r\nold articles \xe2\x80\x98On Leaving,\xe2\x80\x99 had a general dim resemblance to human\r\nlisteners; especially where a shiny black sou\xe2\x80\x99wester suit and hat hung,\r\nlooking very like a clumsy mariner with his back to the company, who\r\nwas so curious to overhear, that he paused for the purpose with his\r\ncoat half pulled on, and his shoulders up to his ears in the uncompleted\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe visitor first held the bottle against the light of the candle,\r\nand next examined the top of the cork. Satisfied that it had not been\r\ntampered with, he slowly took from his breastpocket a rusty clasp-knife,\r\nand, with a corkscrew in the handle, opened the wine. That done,\r\nhe looked at the cork, unscrewed it from the corkscrew, laid each\r\nseparately on the table, and, with the end of the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s knot of his\r\nneckerchief, dusted the inside of the neck of the bottle. All this with\r\ngreat deliberation.\r\n\r\nAt first Riderhood had sat with his footless glass extended at arm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlength for filling, while the very deliberate stranger seemed absorbed\r\nin his preparations. But, gradually his arm reverted home to him, and\r\nhis glass was lowered and lowered until he rested it upside down upon\r\nthe table. By the same degrees his attention became concentrated on\r\nthe knife. And now, as the man held out the bottle to fill all round,\r\nRiderhood stood up, leaned over the table to look closer at the knife,\r\nand stared from it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I know that knife!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I dare say you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe motioned to him to hold up his glass, and filled it. Riderhood\r\nemptied it to the last drop and began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That there knife--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, composedly. \xe2\x80\x98I was going to drink to your\r\ndaughter. Your health, Miss Riderhood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That knife was the knife of a seaman named George Radfoot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That seaman was well beknown to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s come to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Death has come to him. Death came to him in an ugly shape. He looked,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the man, \xe2\x80\x98very horrible after it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Arter what?\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, with a frowning stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After he was killed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Killed? Who killed him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOnly answering with a shrug, the man filled the footless glass, and\r\nRiderhood emptied it: looking amazedly from his daughter to his visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell a honest man--\xe2\x80\x99 he was recommencing with\r\nhis empty glass in his hand, when his eye became fascinated by the\r\nstranger\xe2\x80\x99s outer coat. He leaned across the table to see it nearer,\r\ntouched the sleeve, turned the cuff to look at the sleeve-lining (the\r\nman, in his perfect composure, offering not the least objection), and\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief as this here coat was George Radfoot\xe2\x80\x99s too!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are right. He wore it the last time you ever saw him, and the last\r\ntime you ever will see him--in this world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief you mean to tell me to my face you killed him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed Riderhood; but, nevertheless, allowing his glass to be filled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe man only answered with another shrug, and showed no symptom of\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wish I may die if I know what to be up to with this chap!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRiderhood, after staring at him, and tossing his last glassful down his\r\nthroat. \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s know what to make of you. Say something plain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, leaning forward across the table, and\r\nspeaking in a low impressive voice. \xe2\x80\x98What a liar you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe honest witness rose, and made as though he would fling his glass in\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s face. The man not wincing, and merely shaking his forefinger\r\nhalf knowingly, half menacingly, the piece of honesty thought better of\r\nit and sat down again, putting the glass down too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when you went to that lawyer yonder in the Temple with that\r\ninvented story,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stranger, in an exasperatingly comfortable\r\nsort of confidence, \xe2\x80\x98you might have had your strong suspicions of a\r\nfriend of your own, you know. I think you had, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Me my suspicions? Of what friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me again whose knife was this?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was possessed by, and was the property of--him as I have made\r\nmention on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, stupidly evading the actual mention of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me again whose coat was this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That there article of clothing likeways belonged to, and was wore\r\nby--him as I have made mention on,\xe2\x80\x99 was again the dull Old Bailey\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suspect that you gave him the credit of the deed, and of keeping\r\ncleverly out of the way. But there was small cleverness in HIS keeping\r\nout of the way. The cleverness would have been, to have got back for one\r\nsingle instant to the light of the sun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Things is come to a pretty pass,\xe2\x80\x99 growled Mr Riderhood, rising to his\r\nfeet, goaded to stand at bay, \xe2\x80\x98when bullyers as is wearing dead men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes, and bullyers as is armed with dead men\xe2\x80\x99s knives, is to come\r\ninto the houses of honest live men, getting their livings by the sweats\r\nof their brows, and is to make these here sort of charges with no rhyme\r\nand no reason, neither the one nor yet the other! Why should I have had\r\nmy suspicions of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you knew him,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man; \xe2\x80\x98because you had been one with\r\nhim, and knew his real character under a fair outside; because on the\r\nnight which you had afterwards reason to believe to be the very night of\r\nthe murder, he came in here, within an hour of his having left his ship\r\nin the docks, and asked you in what lodgings he could find room. Was\r\nthere no stranger with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my world-without-end everlasting Alfred David that you warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwith him,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98You talk big, you do, but things look\r\npretty black against yourself, to my thinking. You charge again\xe2\x80\x99 me that\r\nGeorge Radfoot got lost sight of, and was no more thought of. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat for a sailor? Why there\xe2\x80\x99s fifty such, out of sight and out of\r\nmind, ten times as long as him--through entering in different names,\r\nre-shipping when the out\xe2\x80\x99ard voyage is made, and what not--a turning\r\nup to light every day about here, and no matter made of it. Ask my\r\ndaughter. You could go on Poll Parroting enough with her, when I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome in: Poll Parrot a little with her on this pint. You and your\r\nsuspicions of my suspicions of him! What are my suspicions of you? You\r\ntell me George Radfoot got killed. I ask you who done it and how you\r\nknow it. You carry his knife and you wear his coat. I ask you how you\r\ncome by \xe2\x80\x98em? Hand over that there bottle!\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr Riderhood appeared\r\nto labour under a virtuous delusion that it was his own property. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, turning to his daughter, as he filled the footless\r\nglass, \xe2\x80\x98if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t wasting good sherry wine on you, I\xe2\x80\x99d chuck this at\r\nyou, for Poll Parroting with this man. It\xe2\x80\x99s along of Poll Parroting\r\nthat such like as him gets their suspicions, whereas I gets mine by\r\nargueyment, and being nat\xe2\x80\x99rally a honest man, and sweating away at the\r\nbrow as a honest man ought.\xe2\x80\x99 Here he filled the footless goblet again,\r\nand stood chewing one half of its contents and looking down into the\r\nother as he slowly rolled the wine about in the glass; while Pleasant,\r\nwhose sympathetic hair had come down on her being apostrophised,\r\nrearranged it, much in the style of the tail of a horse when proceeding\r\nto market to be sold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well? Have you finished?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the strange man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Far from it. Now then! I want to know\r\nhow George Radfoot come by his death, and how you come by his kit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you ever do know, you won\xe2\x80\x99t know now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And next I want to know,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Riderhood \xe2\x80\x98whether you mean to\r\ncharge that what-you-may-call-it-murder--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harmon murder, father,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No Poll Parroting!\xe2\x80\x99 he vociferated, in return. \xe2\x80\x98Keep your mouth\r\nshut!--I want to know, you sir, whether you charge that there crime on\r\nGeorge Radfoot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you ever do know, you won\xe2\x80\x99t know now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you done it yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, with a threatening\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I alone know,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man, sternly shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nmysteries of that crime. I alone know that your trumped-up story cannot\r\npossibly be true. I alone know that it must be altogether false, and\r\nthat you must know it to be altogether false. I come here to-night to\r\ntell you so much of what I know, and no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Riderhood, with his crooked eye upon his visitor, meditated for some\r\nmoments, and then refilled his glass, and tipped the contents down his\r\nthroat in three tips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shut the shop-door!\xe2\x80\x99 he then said to his daughter, putting the glass\r\nsuddenly down. \xe2\x80\x98And turn the key and stand by it! If you know all this,\r\nyou sir,\xe2\x80\x99 getting, as he spoke, between the visitor and the door, \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nhan\xe2\x80\x99t you gone to Lawyer Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, also, is alone known to myself,\xe2\x80\x99 was the cool answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the deed, what you say you could\r\ntell is worth from five to ten thousand pound?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it very well, and when I claim the money you shall share it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe honest man paused, and drew a little nearer to the visitor, and a\r\nlittle further from the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the man, quietly, \xe2\x80\x98as well as I know that you and\r\nGeorge Radfoot were one together in more than one dark business; and as\r\nwell as I know that you, Roger Riderhood, conspired against an innocent\r\nman for blood-money; and as well as I know that I can--and that I swear\r\nI will!--give you up on both scores, and be the proof against you in my\r\nown person, if you defy me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Pleasant, from the door. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t defy him! Give way to\r\nhim! Don\xe2\x80\x99t get into more trouble, father!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you leave off a Poll Parroting, I ask you?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Riderhood,\r\nhalf beside himself between the two. Then, propitiatingly and\r\ncrawlingly: \xe2\x80\x98You sir! You han\xe2\x80\x99t said what you want of me. Is it fair, is\r\nit worthy of yourself, to talk of my defying you afore ever you say what\r\nyou want of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want much,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. \xe2\x80\x98This accusation of yours must not be\r\nleft half made and half unmade. What was done for the blood-money must\r\nbe thoroughly undone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; but Shipmate--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call me Shipmate,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain, then,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Riderhood; \xe2\x80\x98there! You won\xe2\x80\x99t object to\r\nCaptain. It\xe2\x80\x99s a honourable title, and you fully look it. Captain! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe man dead? Now I ask you fair. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Gaffer dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, with impatience, \xe2\x80\x98yes, he is dead. What\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can words hurt a dead man, Captain? I only ask you fair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They can hurt the memory of a dead man, and they can hurt his living\r\nchildren. How many children had this man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meaning Gaffer, Captain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of whom else are we speaking?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, with a movement of\r\nhis foot, as if Rogue Riderhood were beginning to sneak before him in\r\nthe body as well as the spirit, and he spurned him off. \xe2\x80\x98I have heard\r\nof a daughter, and a son. I ask for information; I ask YOUR daughter; I\r\nprefer to speak to her. What children did Hexam leave?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPleasant, looking to her father for permission to reply, that honest man\r\nexclaimed with great bitterness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why the devil don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer the Captain? You can Poll Parrot enough\r\nwhen you ain\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to Poll Parrot, you perwerse jade!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Pleasant explained that there were only Lizzie, the\r\ndaughter in question, and the youth. Both very respectable, she added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is dreadful that any stigma should attach to them,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nvisitor, whom the consideration rendered so uneasy that he rose, and\r\npaced to and fro, muttering, \xe2\x80\x98Dreadful! Unforeseen? How could it be\r\nforeseen!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he stopped, and asked aloud: \xe2\x80\x98Where do they live?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPleasant further explained that only the daughter had resided with the\r\nfather at the time of his accidental death, and that she had immediately\r\nafterwards quitted the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98for I have been to the place they dwelt\r\nin, at the time of the inquest. Could you quietly find out for me where\r\nshe lives now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPleasant had no doubt she could do that. Within what time, did she\r\nthink? Within a day. The visitor said that was well, and he would return\r\nfor the information, relying on its being obtained. To this dialogue\r\nRiderhood had attended in silence, and he now obsequiously bespake the\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain! Mentioning them unfort\xe2\x80\x99net words of mine respecting Gaffer,\r\nit is contrairily to be bore in mind that Gaffer always were a precious\r\nrascal, and that his line were a thieving line. Likeways when I went to\r\nthem two Governors, Lawyer Lightwood and the t\xe2\x80\x99other Governor, with\r\nmy information, I may have been a little over-eager for the cause of\r\njustice, or (to put it another way) a little over-stimilated by them\r\nfeelings which rouses a man up, when a pot of money is going about,\r\nto get his hand into that pot of money for his family\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Besides\r\nwhich, I think the wine of them two Governors was--I will not say\r\na hocussed wine, but fur from a wine as was elthy for the mind. And\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s another thing to be remembered, Captain. Did I stick to them\r\nwords when Gaffer was no more, and did I say bold to them two Governors,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGovernors both, wot I informed I still inform; wot was took down I hold\r\nto\xe2\x80\x9d? No. I says, frank and open--no shuffling, mind you, Captain!--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmay have been mistook, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a thinking of it, it mayn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\ntook down correct on this and that, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t swear to thick and thin,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d rayther forfeit your good opinions than do it.\xe2\x80\x9d And so far as\r\nI know,\xe2\x80\x99 concluded Mr Riderhood, by way of proof and evidence to\r\ncharacter, \xe2\x80\x98I HAVE actiwally forfeited the good opinions of several\r\npersons--even your own, Captain, if I understand your words--but I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsooner do it than be forswore. There; if that\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy, call me\r\nconspirator.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall sign,\xe2\x80\x99 said the visitor, taking very little heed of this\r\noration, \xe2\x80\x98a statement that it was all utterly false, and the poor girl\r\nshall have it. I will bring it with me for your signature, when I come\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When might you be expected, Captain?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Riderhood, again\r\ndubiously getting between him and door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite soon enough for you. I shall not disappoint you; don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might you be inclined to leave any name, Captain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not at all. I have no such intention.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cShall\xe2\x80\x9d is summ\xe2\x80\x99at of a hard word, Captain,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Riderhood, still\r\nfeebly dodging between him and the door, as he advanced. \xe2\x80\x98When you say a\r\nman \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d sign this and that and t\xe2\x80\x99other, Captain, you order him about\r\nin a grand sort of a way. Don\xe2\x80\x99t it seem so to yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man stood still, and angrily fixed him with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, father!\xe2\x80\x99 entreated Pleasant, from the door, with her disengaged\r\nhand nervously trembling at her lips; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t get into trouble any\r\nmore!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear me out, Captain, hear me out! All I was wishing to mention,\r\nCaptain, afore you took your departer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sneaking Mr Riderhood,\r\nfalling out of his path, \xe2\x80\x98was, your handsome words relating to the\r\nreward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I claim it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, in a tone which seemed to leave some\r\nsuch words as \xe2\x80\x98you dog,\xe2\x80\x99 very distinctly understood, \xe2\x80\x98you shall share\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking stedfastly at Riderhood, he once more said in a low voice, this\r\ntime with a grim sort of admiration of him as a perfect piece of evil,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a liar you are!\xe2\x80\x99 and, nodding his head twice or thrice over the\r\ncompliment, passed out of the shop. But, to Pleasant he said good-night\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\nThe honest man who gained his living by the sweat of his brow remained\r\nin a state akin to stupefaction, until the footless glass and the\r\nunfinished bottle conveyed themselves into his mind. From his mind he\r\nconveyed them into his hands, and so conveyed the last of the wine into\r\nhis stomach. When that was done, he awoke to a clear perception that\r\nPoll Parroting was solely chargeable with what had passed. Therefore,\r\nnot to be remiss in his duty as a father, he threw a pair of sea-boots\r\nat Pleasant, which she ducked to avoid, and then cried, poor thing,\r\nusing her hair for a pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nA SOLO AND A DUETT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing so hard when the visitor came out at the shop-door\r\ninto the darkness and dirt of Limehouse Hole, that it almost blew him\r\nin again. Doors were slamming violently, lamps were flickering or blown\r\nout, signs were rocking in their frames, the water of the kennels,\r\nwind-dispersed, flew about in drops like rain. Indifferent to the\r\nweather, and even preferring it to better weather for its clearance of\r\nthe streets, the man looked about him with a scrutinizing glance. \xe2\x80\x98Thus\r\nmuch I know,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured. \xe2\x80\x98I have never been here since that night, and\r\nnever was here before that night, but thus much I recognize. I wonder\r\nwhich way did we take when we came out of that shop. We turned to the\r\nright as I have turned, but I can recall no more. Did we go by this\r\nalley? Or down that little lane?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe tried both, but both confused him equally, and he came straying\r\nback to the same spot. \xe2\x80\x98I remember there were poles pushed out of upper\r\nwindows on which clothes were drying, and I remember a low public-house,\r\nand the sound flowing down a narrow passage belonging to it of the\r\nscraping of a fiddle and the shuffling of feet. But here are all these\r\nthings in the lane, and here are all these things in the alley. And I\r\nhave nothing else in my mind but a wall, a dark doorway, a flight of\r\nstairs, and a room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe tried a new direction, but made nothing of it; walls, dark doorways,\r\nflights of stairs and rooms, were too abundant. And, like most people so\r\npuzzled, he again and again described a circle, and found himself at\r\nthe point from which he had begun. \xe2\x80\x98This is like what I have read in\r\nnarratives of escape from prison,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98where the little track of\r\nthe fugitives in the night always seems to take the shape of the great\r\nround world, on which they wander; as if it were a secret law.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere he ceased to be the oakum-headed, oakum-whiskered man on whom Miss\r\nPleasant Riderhood had looked, and, allowing for his being still wrapped\r\nin a nautical overcoat, became as like that same lost wanted Mr Julius\r\nHandford, as never man was like another in this world. In the breast of\r\nthe coat he stowed the bristling hair and whisker, in a moment, as the\r\nfavouring wind went with him down a solitary place that it had swept\r\nclear of passengers. Yet in that same moment he was the Secretary also,\r\nMr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary. For John Rokesmith, too, was as like that same\r\nlost wanted Mr Julius Handford as never man was like another in this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no clue to the scene of my death,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Not that it matters\r\nnow. But having risked discovery by venturing here at all, I should have\r\nbeen glad to track some part of the way.\xe2\x80\x99 With which singular words he\r\nabandoned his search, came up out of Limehouse Hole, and took the way\r\npast Limehouse Church. At the great iron gate of the churchyard he\r\nstopped and looked in. He looked up at the high tower spectrally\r\nresisting the wind, and he looked round at the white tombstones, like\r\nenough to the dead in their winding-sheets, and he counted the nine\r\ntolls of the clock-bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a sensation not experienced by many mortals,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98to be\r\nlooking into a churchyard on a wild windy night, and to feel that I no\r\nmore hold a place among the living than these dead do, and even to know\r\nthat I lie buried somewhere else, as they lie buried here. Nothing uses\r\nme to it. A spirit that was once a man could hardly feel stranger or\r\nlonelier, going unrecognized among mankind, than I feel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this is the fanciful side of the situation. It has a real side, so\r\ndifficult that, though I think of it every day, I never thoroughly think\r\nit out. Now, let me determine to think it out as I walk home. I know\r\nI evade it, as many men--perhaps most men--do evade thinking their way\r\nthrough their greatest perplexity. I will try to pin myself to mine.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t evade it, John Harmon; don\xe2\x80\x99t evade it; think it out!\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I came to England, attracted to the country with which I had none\r\nbut most miserable associations, by the accounts of my fine inheritance\r\nthat found me abroad, I came back, shrinking from my father\xe2\x80\x99s money,\r\nshrinking from my father\xe2\x80\x99s memory, mistrustful of being forced on a\r\nmercenary wife, mistrustful of my father\xe2\x80\x99s intention in thrusting that\r\nmarriage on me, mistrustful that I was already growing avaricious,\r\nmistrustful that I was slackening in gratitude to the two dear noble\r\nhonest friends who had made the only sunlight in my childish life or\r\nthat of my heartbroken sister. I came back, timid, divided in my mind,\r\nafraid of myself and everybody here, knowing of nothing but wretchedness\r\nthat my father\xe2\x80\x99s wealth had ever brought about. Now, stop, and so far\r\nthink it out, John Harmon. Is that so? That is exactly so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On board serving as third mate was George Radfoot. I knew nothing of\r\nhim. His name first became known to me about a week before we sailed,\r\nthrough my being accosted by one of the ship-agent\xe2\x80\x99s clerks as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr Radfoot.\xe2\x80\x9d It was one day when I had gone aboard to look to my\r\npreparations, and the clerk, coming behind me as I stood on deck, tapped\r\nme on the shoulder, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr Rad-foot, look here,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to\r\nsome papers that he had in his hand. And my name first became known to\r\nRadfoot, through another clerk within a day or two, and while the ship\r\nwas yet in port, coming up behind him, tapping him on the shoulder and\r\nbeginning, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr Harmon--.\xe2\x80\x9d I believe we were alike\r\nin bulk and stature but not otherwise, and that we were not strikingly\r\nalike, even in those respects, when we were together and could be\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, a sociable word or two on these mistakes became an easy\r\nintroduction between us, and the weather was hot, and he helped me to a\r\ncool cabin on deck alongside his own, and his first school had been at\r\nBrussels as mine had been, and he had learnt French as I had learnt it,\r\nand he had a little history of himself to relate--God only knows how\r\nmuch of it true, and how much of it false--that had its likeness to\r\nmine. I had been a seaman too. So we got to be confidential together,\r\nand the more easily yet, because he and every one on board had known\r\nby general rumour what I was making the voyage to England for. By such\r\ndegrees and means, he came to the knowledge of my uneasiness of mind,\r\nand of its setting at that time in the direction of desiring to see and\r\nform some judgment of my allotted wife, before she could possibly know\r\nme for myself; also to try Mrs Boffin and give her a glad surprise. So\r\nthe plot was made out of our getting common sailors\xe2\x80\x99 dresses (as he was\r\nable to guide me about London), and throwing ourselves in Bella Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneighbourhood, and trying to put ourselves in her way, and doing\r\nwhatever chance might favour on the spot, and seeing what came of it. If\r\nnothing came of it, I should be no worse off, and there would merely\r\nbe a short delay in my presenting myself to Lightwood. I have all these\r\nfacts right? Yes. They are all accurately right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His advantage in all this was, that for a time I was to be lost. It\r\nmight be for a day or for two days, but I must be lost sight of on\r\nlanding, or there would be recognition, anticipation, and failure.\r\nTherefore, I disembarked with my valise in my hand--as Potterson\r\nthe steward and Mr Jacob Kibble my fellow-passenger afterwards\r\nremembered--and waited for him in the dark by that very Limehouse Church\r\nwhich is now behind me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I had always shunned the port of London, I only knew the church\r\nthrough his pointing out its spire from on board. Perhaps I might\r\nrecall, if it were any good to try, the way by which I went to it alone\r\nfrom the river; but how we two went from it to Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s shop, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow--any more than I know what turns we took and doubles we made, after\r\nwe left it. The way was purposely confused, no doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But let me go on thinking the facts out, and avoid confusing them with\r\nmy speculations. Whether he took me by a straight way or a crooked way,\r\nwhat is that to the purpose now? Steady, John Harmon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When we stopped at Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s, and he asked that scoundrel a question\r\nor two, purporting to refer only to the lodging-houses in which there\r\nwas accommodation for us, had I the least suspicion of him? None.\r\nCertainly none until afterwards when I held the clue. I think he must\r\nhave got from Riderhood in a paper, the drug, or whatever it was, that\r\nafterwards stupefied me, but I am far from sure. All I felt safe in\r\ncharging on him to-night, was old companionship in villainy between\r\nthem. Their undisguised intimacy, and the character I now know Riderhood\r\nto bear, made that not at all adventurous. But I am not clear about the\r\ndrug. Thinking out the circumstances on which I found my suspicion, they\r\nare only two. One: I remember his changing a small folded paper from one\r\npocket to another, after we came out, which he had not touched before.\r\nTwo: I now know Riderhood to have been previously taken up for being\r\nconcerned in the robbery of an unlucky seaman, to whom some such poison\r\nhad been given.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is my conviction that we cannot have gone a mile from that shop,\r\nbefore we came to the wall, the dark doorway, the flight of stairs, and\r\nthe room. The night was particularly dark and it rained hard. As I think\r\nthe circumstances back, I hear the rain splashing on the stone pavement\r\nof the passage, which was not under cover. The room overlooked the\r\nriver, or a dock, or a creek, and the tide was out. Being possessed of\r\nthe time down to that point, I know by the hour that it must have been\r\nabout low water; but while the coffee was getting ready, I drew back the\r\ncurtain (a dark-brown curtain), and, looking out, knew by the kind\r\nof reflection below, of the few neighbouring lights, that they were\r\nreflected in tidal mud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He had carried under his arm a canvas bag, containing a suit of his\r\nclothes. I had no change of outer clothes with me, as I was to buy\r\nslops. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very wet, Mr Harmon,\xe2\x80\x9d--I can hear him saying--\xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\nquite dry under this good waterproof coat. Put on these clothes of\r\nmine. You may find on trying them that they will answer your purpose\r\nto-morrow, as well as the slops you mean to buy, or better. While you\r\nchange, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hurry the hot coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d When he came back, I had his clothes\r\non, and there was a black man with him, wearing a linen jacket, like\r\na steward, who put the smoking coffee on the table in a tray and never\r\nlooked at me. I am so far literal and exact? Literal and exact, I am\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I pass to sick and deranged impressions; they are so strong, that\r\nI rely upon them; but there are spaces between them that I know nothing\r\nabout, and they are not pervaded by any idea of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had drank some coffee, when to my sense of sight he began to swell\r\nimmensely, and something urged me to rush at him. We had a struggle near\r\nthe door. He got from me, through my not knowing where to strike, in the\r\nwhirling round of the room, and the flashing of flames of fire between\r\nus. I dropped down. Lying helpless on the ground, I was turned over by\r\na foot. I was dragged by the neck into a corner. I heard men speak\r\ntogether. I was turned over by other feet. I saw a figure like myself\r\nlying dressed in my clothes on a bed. What might have been, for anything\r\nI knew, a silence of days, weeks, months, years, was broken by a violent\r\nwrestling of men all over the room. The figure like myself was assailed,\r\nand my valise was in its hand. I was trodden upon and fallen over. I\r\nheard a noise of blows, and thought it was a wood-cutter cutting down\r\na tree. I could not have said that my name was John Harmon--I could not\r\nhave thought it--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it--but when I heard the blows, I thought\r\nof the wood-cutter and his axe, and had some dead idea that I was lying\r\nin a forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is still correct? Still correct, with the exception that I cannot\r\npossibly express it to myself without using the word I. But it was not\r\nI. There was no such thing as I, within my knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was only after a downward slide through something like a tube, and\r\nthen a great noise and a sparkling and crackling as of fires, that the\r\nconsciousness came upon me, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is John Harmon drowning! John Harmon,\r\nstruggle for your life. John Harmon, call on Heaven and save yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I think I cried it out aloud in a great agony, and then a heavy horrid\r\nunintelligible something vanished, and it was I who was struggling there\r\nalone in the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was very weak and faint, frightfully oppressed with drowsiness, and\r\ndriving fast with the tide. Looking over the black water, I saw the\r\nlights racing past me on the two banks of the river, as if they were\r\neager to be gone and leave me dying in the dark. The tide was running\r\ndown, but I knew nothing of up or down then. When, guiding myself safely\r\nwith Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s assistance before the fierce set of the water, I at last\r\ncaught at a boat moored, one of a tier of boats at a causeway, I was\r\nsucked under her, and came up, only just alive, on the other side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was I long in the water? Long enough to be chilled to the heart, but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long. Yet the cold was merciful, for it was the cold\r\nnight air and the rain that restored me from a swoon on the stones of\r\nthe causeway. They naturally supposed me to have toppled in, drunk, when\r\nI crept to the public-house it belonged to; for I had no notion where\r\nI was, and could not articulate--through the poison that had made me\r\ninsensible having affected my speech--and I supposed the night to be\r\nthe previous night, as it was still dark and raining. But I had lost\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have checked the calculation often, and it must have been two nights\r\nthat I lay recovering in that public-house. Let me see. Yes. I am sure\r\nit was while I lay in that bed there, that the thought entered my head\r\nof turning the danger I had passed through, to the account of being\r\nfor some time supposed to have disappeared mysteriously, and of proving\r\nBella. The dread of our being forced on one another, and perpetuating\r\nthe fate that seemed to have fallen on my father\xe2\x80\x99s riches--the fate that\r\nthey should lead to nothing but evil--was strong upon the moral timidity\r\nthat dates from my childhood with my poor sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to this hour I cannot understand that side of the river where I\r\nrecovered the shore, being the opposite side to that on which I was\r\nensnared, I shall never understand it now. Even at this moment, while I\r\nleave the river behind me, going home, I cannot conceive that it rolls\r\nbetween me and that spot, or that the sea is where it is. But this is\r\nnot thinking it out; this is making a leap to the present time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could not have done it, but for the fortune in the waterproof\r\nbelt round my body. Not a great fortune, forty and odd pounds for the\r\ninheritor of a hundred and odd thousand! But it was enough. Without it I\r\nmust have disclosed myself. Without it, I could never have gone to that\r\nExchequer Coffee House, or taken Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some twelve days I lived at that hotel, before the night when I saw the\r\ncorpse of Radfoot at the Police Station. The inexpressible mental horror\r\nthat I laboured under, as one of the consequences of the poison, makes\r\nthe interval seem greatly longer, but I know it cannot have been longer.\r\nThat suffering has gradually weakened and weakened since, and has only\r\ncome upon me by starts, and I hope I am free from it now; but even now,\r\nI have sometimes to think, constrain myself, and stop before speaking,\r\nor I could not say the words I want to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again I ramble away from thinking it out to the end. It is not so far\r\nto the end that I need be tempted to break off. Now, on straight!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I examined the newspapers every day for tidings that I was missing, but\r\nsaw none. Going out that night to walk (for I kept retired while it was\r\nlight), I found a crowd assembled round a placard posted at Whitehall.\r\nIt described myself, John Harmon, as found dead and mutilated in the\r\nriver under circumstances of strong suspicion, described my dress,\r\ndescribed the papers in my pockets, and stated where I was lying for\r\nrecognition. In a wild incautious way I hurried there, and there--with\r\nthe horror of the death I had escaped, before my eyes in its most\r\nappalling shape, added to the inconceivable horror tormenting me at\r\nthat time when the poisonous stuff was strongest on me--I perceived that\r\nRadfoot had been murdered by some unknown hands for the money for which\r\nhe would have murdered me, and that probably we had both been shot into\r\nthe river from the same dark place into the same dark tide, when the\r\nstream ran deep and strong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That night I almost gave up my mystery, though I suspected no one,\r\ncould offer no information, knew absolutely nothing save that the\r\nmurdered man was not I, but Radfoot. Next day while I hesitated, and\r\nnext day while I hesitated, it seemed as if the whole country were\r\ndetermined to have me dead. The Inquest declared me dead, the Government\r\nproclaimed me dead; I could not listen at my fireside for five minutes\r\nto the outer noises, but it was borne into my ears that I was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So John Harmon died, and Julius Handford disappeared, and John\r\nRokesmith was born. John Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s intent to-night has been to repair\r\na wrong that he could never have imagined possible, coming to his ears\r\nthrough the Lightwood talk related to him, and which he is bound by\r\nevery consideration to remedy. In that intent John Rokesmith will\r\npersevere, as his duty is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, is it all thought out? All to this time? Nothing omitted? No,\r\nnothing. But beyond this time? To think it out through the future, is a\r\nharder though a much shorter task than to think it out through the past.\r\nJohn Harmon is dead. Should John Harmon come to life?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If yes, why? If no, why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take yes, first. To enlighten human Justice concerning the offence of\r\none far beyond it who may have a living mother. To enlighten it with the\r\nlights of a stone passage, a flight of stairs, a brown window-curtain,\r\nand a black man. To come into possession of my father\xe2\x80\x99s money, and with\r\nit sordidly to buy a beautiful creature whom I love--I cannot help it;\r\nreason has nothing to do with it; I love her against reason--but who\r\nwould as soon love me for my own sake, as she would love the beggar at\r\nthe corner. What a use for the money, and how worthy of its old misuses!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, take no. The reasons why John Harmon should not come to life.\r\nBecause he has passively allowed these dear old faithful friends to pass\r\ninto possession of the property. Because he sees them happy with it,\r\nmaking a good use of it, effacing the old rust and tarnish on the money.\r\nBecause they have virtually adopted Bella, and will provide for her.\r\nBecause there is affection enough in her nature, and warmth enough in\r\nher heart, to develop into something enduringly good, under favourable\r\nconditions. Because her faults have been intensified by her place in my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s will, and she is already growing better. Because her marriage\r\nwith John Harmon, after what I have heard from her own lips, would be a\r\nshocking mockery, of which both she and I must always be conscious, and\r\nwhich would degrade her in her mind, and me in mine, and each of us in\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x99s. Because if John Harmon comes to life and does not marry\r\nher, the property falls into the very hands that hold it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would I have? Dead, I have found the true friends of my lifetime\r\nstill as true as tender and as faithful as when I was alive, and making\r\nmy memory an incentive to good actions done in my name. Dead, I have\r\nfound them when they might have slighted my name, and passed\r\ngreedily over my grave to ease and wealth, lingering by the way, like\r\nsingle-hearted children, to recall their love for me when I was a poor\r\nfrightened child. Dead, I have heard from the woman who would have been\r\nmy wife if I had lived, the revolting truth that I should have purchased\r\nher, caring nothing for me, as a Sultan buys a slave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would I have? If the dead could know, or do know, how the living\r\nuse them, who among the hosts of dead has found a more disinterested\r\nfidelity on earth than I? Is not that enough for me? If I had come back,\r\nthese noble creatures would have welcomed me, wept over me, given up\r\neverything to me with joy. I did not come back, and they have passed\r\nunspoiled into my place. Let them rest in it, and let Bella rest in\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What course for me then? This. To live the same quiet Secretary life,\r\ncarefully avoiding chances of recognition, until they shall have become\r\nmore accustomed to their altered state, and until the great swarm of\r\nswindlers under many names shall have found newer prey. By that time,\r\nthe method I am establishing through all the affairs, and with which I\r\nwill every day take new pains to make them both familiar, will be, I may\r\nhope, a machine in such working order as that they can keep it going.\r\nI know I need but ask of their generosity, to have. When the right time\r\ncomes, I will ask no more than will replace me in my former path of\r\nlife, and John Rokesmith shall tread it as contentedly as he may. But\r\nJohn Harmon shall come back no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I may never, in the days to come afar off, have any weak misgiving\r\nthat Bella might, in any contingency, have taken me for my own sake if\r\nI had plainly asked her, I WILL plainly ask her: proving beyond all\r\nquestion what I already know too well. And now it is all thought out,\r\nfrom the beginning to the end, and my mind is easier.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nSo deeply engaged had the living-dead man been, in thus communing with\r\nhimself, that he had regarded neither the wind nor the way, and had\r\nresisted the former instinctively as he had pursued the latter. But\r\nbeing now come into the City, where there was a coach-stand, he stood\r\nirresolute whether to go to his lodgings, or to go first to Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. He decided to go round by the house, arguing, as he carried his\r\novercoat upon his arm, that it was less likely to attract notice if left\r\nthere, than if taken to Holloway: both Mrs Wilfer and Miss Lavinia being\r\nravenously curious touching every article of which the lodger stood\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nArriving at the house, he found that Mr and Mrs Boffin were out, but\r\nthat Miss Wilfer was in the drawing-room. Miss Wilfer had remained at\r\nhome, in consequence of not feeling very well, and had inquired in the\r\nevening if Mr Rokesmith were in his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Make my compliments to Miss Wilfer, and say I am here now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s compliments came down in return, and, if it were not too\r\nmuch trouble, would Mr Rokesmith be so kind as to come up before he\r\nwent?\r\n\r\nIt was not too much trouble, and Mr Rokesmith came up.\r\n\r\nOh she looked very pretty, she looked very, very pretty! If the father\r\nof the late John Harmon had but left his money unconditionally to his\r\nson, and if his son had but lighted on this loveable girl for himself,\r\nand had the happiness to make her loving as well as loveable!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me! Are you not well, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, quite well. I was sorry to hear, when I came in, that YOU were\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A mere nothing. I had a headache--gone now--and was not quite fit for\r\na hot theatre, so I stayed at home. I asked you if you were not well,\r\nbecause you look so white.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I? I have had a busy evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was on a low ottoman before the fire, with a little shining jewel\r\nof a table, and her book and her work, beside her. Ah! what a different\r\nlife the late John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s, if it had been his happy privilege to take\r\nhis place upon that ottoman, and draw his arm about that waist, and say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope the time has been long without me? What a Home Goddess you look,\r\nmy darling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, the present John Rokesmith, far removed from the late John Harmon,\r\nremained standing at a distance. A little distance in respect of space,\r\nbut a great distance in respect of separation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, taking up her work, and inspecting it all\r\nround the corners, \xe2\x80\x98I wanted to say something to you when I could have\r\nthe opportunity, as an explanation why I was rude to you the other day.\r\nYou have no right to think ill of me, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sharp little way in which she darted a look at him, half sensitively\r\ninjured, and half pettishly, would have been very much admired by the\r\nlate John Harmon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how well I think of you, Miss Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, you must have a very high opinion of me, Mr Rokesmith, when you\r\nbelieve that in prosperity I neglect and forget my old home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I believe so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You DID, sir, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took the liberty of reminding you of a little omission into which you\r\nhad fallen--insensibly and naturally fallen. It was no more than that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I beg leave to ask you, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98why you took\r\nthat liberty?--I hope there is no offence in the phrase; it is your own,\r\nremember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I am truly, deeply, profoundly interested in you, Miss Wilfer.\r\nBecause I wish to see you always at your best. Because I--shall I go\r\non?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, with a burning face, \xe2\x80\x98you have said more than\r\nenough. I beg that you will NOT go on. If you have any generosity, any\r\nhonour, you will say no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe late John Harmon, looking at the proud face with the down-cast eyes,\r\nand at the quick breathing as it stirred the fall of bright brown hair\r\nover the beautiful neck, would probably have remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish to speak to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98once for all, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to do it. I have sat here all this evening, wishing to speak to\r\nyou, and determining to speak to you, and feeling that I must. I beg for\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe remained silent, and she remained with her face averted, sometimes\r\nmaking a slight movement as if she would turn and speak. At length she\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know how I am situated here, sir, and you know how I am situated\r\nat home. I must speak to you for myself, since there is no one about\r\nme whom I could ask to do so. It is not generous in you, it is not\r\nhonourable in you, to conduct yourself towards me as you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it ungenerous or dishonourable to be devoted to you; fascinated by\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Preposterous!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\nThe late John Harmon might have thought it rather a contemptuous and\r\nlofty word of repudiation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I now feel obliged to go on,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98though it were\r\nonly in self-explanation and self-defence. I hope, Miss Wilfer, that\r\nit is not unpardonable--even in me--to make an honest declaration of an\r\nhonest devotion to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An honest declaration!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bella, with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it otherwise?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must request, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, taking refuge in a touch of timely\r\nresentment, \xe2\x80\x98that I may not be questioned. You must excuse me if I\r\ndecline to be cross-examined.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Miss Wilfer, this is hardly charitable. I ask you nothing but what\r\nyour own emphasis suggests. However, I waive even that question. But\r\nwhat I have declared, I take my stand by. I cannot recall the avowal of\r\nmy earnest and deep attachment to you, and I do not recall it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I reject it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be blind and deaf if I were not prepared for the reply.\r\nForgive my offence, for it carries its punishment with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What punishment?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is my present endurance none? But excuse me; I did not mean to\r\ncross-examine you again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You take advantage of a hasty word of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella with a little\r\nsting of self-reproach, \xe2\x80\x98to make me seem--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. I spoke\r\nwithout consideration when I used it. If that was bad, I am sorry; but\r\nyou repeat it after consideration, and that seems to me to be at least\r\nno better. For the rest, I beg it may be understood, Mr Rokesmith, that\r\nthere is an end of this between us, now and for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now and for ever,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I appeal to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Bella with increasing spirit,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98not to pursue me. I appeal to you not to take advantage of your\r\nposition in this house to make my position in it distressing and\r\ndisagreeable. I appeal to you to discontinue your habit of making your\r\nmisplaced attentions as plain to Mrs Boffin as to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I done so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think you have,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bella. \xe2\x80\x98In any case it is not your\r\nfault if you have not, Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you are wrong in that impression. I should be very sorry to\r\nhave justified it. I think I have not. For the future there is no\r\napprehension. It is all over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much relieved to hear it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I have far other views in\r\nlife, and why should you waste your own?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mine!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98My life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis curious tone caused Bella to glance at the curious smile with which\r\nhe said it. It was gone as he glanced back. \xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, Miss Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe proceeded, when their eyes met; \xe2\x80\x98you have used some hard words, for\r\nwhich I do not doubt you have a justification in your mind, that I do\r\nnot understand. Ungenerous and dishonourable. In what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather not be asked,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, haughtily looking down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather not ask, but the question is imposed upon me. Kindly\r\nexplain; or if not kindly, justly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, raising her eyes to his, after a little struggle\r\nto forbear, \xe2\x80\x98is it generous and honourable to use the power here which\r\nyour favour with Mr and Mrs Boffin and your ability in your place give\r\nyou, against me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Against you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it generous and honourable to form a plan for gradually bringing\r\ntheir influence to bear upon a suit which I have shown you that I do not\r\nlike, and which I tell you that I utterly reject?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe late John Harmon could have borne a good deal, but he would have\r\nbeen cut to the heart by such a suspicion as this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it be generous and honourable to step into your place--if you did\r\nso, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you did, and I hope you did not--anticipating,\r\nor knowing beforehand, that I should come here, and designing to take me\r\nat this disadvantage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This mean and cruel disadvantage,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Bella.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary kept silence for a little while; then merely said, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nare wholly mistaken, Miss Wilfer; wonderfully mistaken. I cannot say,\r\nhowever, that it is your fault. If I deserve better things of you, you\r\ndo not know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bella, with her old indignation rising, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nknow the history of my being here at all. I have heard Mr Boffin say\r\nthat you are master of every line and word of that will, as you are\r\nmaster of all his affairs. And was it not enough that I should have been\r\nwilled away, like a horse, or a dog, or a bird; but must you too begin\r\nto dispose of me in your mind, and speculate in me, as soon as I had\r\nceased to be the talk and the laugh of the town? Am I for ever to be\r\nmade the property of strangers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Believe me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98you are wonderfully mistaken.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be glad to know it,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt if you ever will. Good-night. Of course I shall be careful to\r\nconceal any traces of this interview from Mr and Mrs Boffin, as long as\r\nI remain here. Trust me, what you have complained of is at an end for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad I have spoken, then, Mr Rokesmith. It has been painful and\r\ndifficult, but it is done. If I have hurt you, I hope you will forgive\r\nme. I am inexperienced and impetuous, and I have been a little spoilt;\r\nbut I really am not so bad as I dare say I appear, or as you think me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe quitted the room when Bella had said this, relenting in her wilful\r\ninconsistent way. Left alone, she threw herself back on her ottoman, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the lovely woman was such a Dragon!\xe2\x80\x99 Then, she\r\ngot up and looked in the glass, and said to her image, \xe2\x80\x98You have been\r\npositively swelling your features, you little fool!\xe2\x80\x99 Then, she took an\r\nimpatient walk to the other end of the room and back, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwish Pa was here to have a talk about an avaricious marriage; but he\r\nis better away, poor dear, for I know I should pull his hair if he WAS\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99 And then she threw her work away, and threw her book after\r\nit, and sat down and hummed a tune, and hummed it out of tune, and\r\nquarrelled with it.\r\n\r\nAnd John Rokesmith, what did he?\r\n\r\nHe went down to his room, and buried John Harmon many additional fathoms\r\ndeep. He took his hat, and walked out, and, as he went to Holloway or\r\nanywhere else--not at all minding where--heaped mounds upon mounds of\r\nearth over John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s grave. His walking did not bring him home until\r\nthe dawn of day. And so busy had he been all night, piling and piling\r\nweights upon weights of earth above John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s grave, that by that\r\ntime John Harmon lay buried under a whole Alpine range; and still the\r\nSexton Rokesmith accumulated mountains over him, lightening his labour\r\nwith the dirge, \xe2\x80\x98Cover him, crush him, keep him down!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nSTRONG OF PURPOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sexton-task of piling earth above John Harmon all night long, was\r\nnot conducive to sound sleep; but Rokesmith had some broken morning\r\nrest, and rose strengthened in his purpose. It was all over now. No\r\nghost should trouble Mr and Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s peace; invisible and voiceless,\r\nthe ghost should look on for a little while longer at the state of\r\nexistence out of which it had departed, and then should for ever cease\r\nto haunt the scenes in which it had no place.\r\n\r\nHe went over it all again. He had lapsed into the condition in which\r\nhe found himself, as many a man lapses into many a condition, without\r\nperceiving the accumulative power of its separate circumstances. When\r\nin the distrust engendered by his wretched childhood and the action for\r\nevil--never yet for good within his knowledge then--of his father and\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s wealth on all within their influence, he conceived the idea\r\nof his first deception, it was meant to be harmless, it was to last\r\nbut a few hours or days, it was to involve in it only the girl so\r\ncapriciously forced upon him and upon whom he was so capriciously\r\nforced, and it was honestly meant well towards her. For, if he had\r\nfound her unhappy in the prospect of that marriage (through her heart\r\ninclining to another man or for any other cause), he would seriously\r\nhave said: \xe2\x80\x98This is another of the old perverted uses of the\r\nmisery-making money. I will let it go to my and my sister\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nprotectors and friends.\xe2\x80\x99 When the snare into which he fell so\r\noutstripped his first intention as that he found himself placarded by\r\nthe police authorities upon the London walls for dead, he confusedly\r\naccepted the aid that fell upon him, without considering how firmly it\r\nmust seem to fix the Boffins in their accession to the fortune. When he\r\nsaw them, and knew them, and even from his vantage-ground of inspection\r\ncould find no flaw in them, he asked himself, \xe2\x80\x98And shall I come to life\r\nto dispossess such people as these?\xe2\x80\x99 There was no good to set against\r\nthe putting of them to that hard proof. He had heard from Bella\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nlips when he stood tapping at the door on that night of his taking\r\nthe lodgings, that the marriage would have been on her part thoroughly\r\nmercenary. He had since tried her, in his own unknown person and\r\nsupposed station, and she not only rejected his advances but resented\r\nthem. Was it for him to have the shame of buying her, or the meanness of\r\npunishing her? Yet, by coming to life and accepting the condition of the\r\ninheritance, he must do the former; and by coming to life and rejecting\r\nit, he must do the latter.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence that he had never foreshadowed, was the implication\r\nof an innocent man in his supposed murder. He would obtain complete\r\nretraction from the accuser, and set the wrong right; but clearly the\r\nwrong could never have been done if he had never planned a deception.\r\nThen, whatever inconvenience or distress of mind the deception cost him,\r\nit was manful repentantly to accept as among its consequences, and make\r\nno complaint.\r\n\r\nThus John Rokesmith in the morning, and it buried John Harmon still many\r\nfathoms deeper than he had been buried in the night.\r\n\r\nGoing out earlier than he was accustomed to do, he encountered the\r\ncherub at the door. The cherub\xe2\x80\x99s way was for a certain space his way,\r\nand they walked together.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to notice the change in the cherub\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\r\nThe cherub felt very conscious of it, and modestly remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A present from my daughter Bella, Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words gave the Secretary a stroke of pleasure, for he remembered the\r\nfifty pounds, and he still loved the girl. No doubt it was very weak--it\r\nalways IS very weak, some authorities hold--but he loved the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you happen to have read many books of African\r\nTravel, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 said R. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have read several.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s usually a King George, or a King Boy, or a King\r\nSambo, or a King Bill, or Bull, or Rum, or Junk, or whatever name the\r\nsailors may have happened to give him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anywhere. Anywhere in Africa, I mean. Pretty well everywhere, I may\r\nsay; for black kings are cheap--and I think\xe2\x80\x99--said R. W., with an\r\napologetic air, \xe2\x80\x98nasty\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much of your opinion, Mr Wilfer. You were going to say--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was going to say, the king is generally dressed in a London hat only,\r\nor a Manchester pair of braces, or one epaulette, or an uniform coat\r\nwith his legs in the sleeves, or something of that kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In confidence, I assure you, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the cheerful\r\ncherub, \xe2\x80\x98that when more of my family were at home and to be provided\r\nfor, I used to remind myself immensely of that king. You have no idea,\r\nas a single man, of the difficulty I have had in wearing more than one\r\ngood article at a time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can easily believe it, Mr Wilfer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only mention it,\xe2\x80\x99 said R. W. in the warmth of his heart, \xe2\x80\x98as a proof\r\nof the amiable, delicate, and considerate affection of my daughter\r\nBella. If she had been a little spoilt, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought so very\r\nmuch of it, under the circumstances. But no, not a bit. And she is so\r\nvery pretty! I hope you agree with me in finding her very pretty, Mr\r\nRokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I do. Every one must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub. \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, I have no doubt of it. This is a\r\ngreat advancement for her in life, Mr Rokesmith. A great opening of her\r\nprospects?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Wilfer could have no better friends than Mr and Mrs Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible!\xe2\x80\x99 said the gratified cherub. \xe2\x80\x98Really I begin to think things\r\nare very well as they are. If Mr John Harmon had lived--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is better dead,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to say that,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the cherub, a little\r\nremonstrant against the very decisive and unpitying tone; \xe2\x80\x98but he\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t have suited Bella, or Bella mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have suited him, or fifty\r\nthings, whereas now I hope she can choose for herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she--as you place the confidence in me of speaking on the subject,\r\nyou will excuse my asking--has she--perhaps--chosen?\xe2\x80\x99 faltered the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear no!\xe2\x80\x99 returned R. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young ladies sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 Rokesmith hinted, \xe2\x80\x98choose without mentioning\r\ntheir choice to their fathers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in this case, Mr Rokesmith. Between my daughter Bella and me there\r\nis a regular league and covenant of confidence. It was ratified only the\r\nother day. The ratification dates from--these,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub,\r\ngiving a little pull at the lappels of his coat and the pockets of his\r\ntrousers. \xe2\x80\x98Oh no, she has not chosen. To be sure, young George Sampson,\r\nin the days when Mr John Harmon--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who I wish had never been born!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, with a gloomy\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\nR. W. looked at him with surprise, as thinking he had contracted an\r\nunaccountable spite against the poor deceased, and continued: \xe2\x80\x98In the\r\ndays when Mr John Harmon was being sought out, young George Sampson\r\ncertainly was hovering about Bella, and Bella let him hover. But it\r\nnever was seriously thought of, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still less than ever to be\r\nthought of now. For Bella is ambitious, Mr Rokesmith, and I think I may\r\npredict will marry fortune. This time, you see, she will have the person\r\nand the property before her together, and will be able to make her\r\nchoice with her eyes open. This is my road. I am very sorry to part\r\ncompany so soon. Good morning, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary pursued his way, not very much elevated in spirits by this\r\nconversation, and, arriving at the Boffin mansion, found Betty Higden\r\nwaiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should thank you kindly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, \xe2\x80\x98if I might make so bold\r\nas have a word or two wi\xe2\x80\x99 you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe should have as many words as she liked, he told her; and took her\r\ninto his room, and made her sit down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis concerning Sloppy, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty. \xe2\x80\x98And that\xe2\x80\x99s how I come here\r\nby myself. Not wishing him to know what I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to say to you, I got\r\nthe start of him early and walked up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have wonderful energy,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Rokesmith. \xe2\x80\x98You are as young as I\r\nam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBetty Higden gravely shook her head. \xe2\x80\x98I am strong for my time of life,\r\nsir, but not young, thank the Lord!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you thankful for not being young?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir. If I was young, it would all have to be gone through again,\r\nand the end would be a weary way off, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? But never mind me;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tis concerning Sloppy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what about him, Betty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis just this, sir. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be reasoned out of his head by any powers\r\nof mine but what that he can do right by your kind lady and gentleman\r\nand do his work for me, both together. Now he can\xe2\x80\x99t. To give himself up\r\nto being put in the way of arning a good living and getting on, he must\r\ngive me up. Well; he won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I respect him for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DO ye, sir? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but what I do myself. Still that don\xe2\x80\x99t make it\r\nright to let him have his way. So as he won\xe2\x80\x99t give me up, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to\r\ngive him up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How, Betty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to run away from him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith an astonished look at the indomitable old face and the bright eyes,\r\nthe Secretary repeated, \xe2\x80\x98Run away from him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, with one nod. And in the nod and in the firm set\r\nof her mouth, there was a vigour of purpose not to be doubted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98We must talk about this. Let us take\r\nour time over it, and try to get at the true sense of the case and the\r\ntrue course, by degrees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, lookee here, by dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned old Betty--\xe2\x80\x98asking your excuse\r\nfor being so familiar, but being of a time of life a\xe2\x80\x99most to be your\r\ngrandmother twice over. Now, lookee, here. \xe2\x80\x98Tis a poor living and a\r\nhard as is to be got out of this work that I\xe2\x80\x99m a doing now, and but for\r\nSloppy I don\xe2\x80\x99t know as I should have held to it this long. But it did\r\njust keep us on, the two together. Now that I\xe2\x80\x99m alone--with even Johnny\r\ngone--I\xe2\x80\x99d far sooner be upon my feet and tiring of myself out, than a\r\nsitting folding and folding by the fire. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na deadness steals over me at times, that the kind of life favours and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like. Now, I seem to have Johnny in my arms--now, his mother--now,\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s mother--now, I seem to be a child myself, a lying once\r\nagain in the arms of my own mother--then I get numbed, thought and\r\nsense, till I start out of my seat, afeerd that I\xe2\x80\x99m a growing like the\r\npoor old people that they brick up in the Unions, as you may sometimes\r\nsee when they let \xe2\x80\x98em out of the four walls to have a warm in the sun,\r\ncrawling quite scared about the streets. I was a nimble girl, and have\r\nalways been a active body, as I told your lady, first time ever I see\r\nher good face. I can still walk twenty mile if I am put to it. I\xe2\x80\x99d far\r\nbetter be a walking than a getting numbed and dreary. I\xe2\x80\x99m a good fair\r\nknitter, and can make many little things to sell. The loan from your\r\nlady and gentleman of twenty shillings to fit out a basket with, would\r\nbe a fortune for me. Trudging round the country and tiring of myself\r\nout, I shall keep the deadness off, and get my own bread by my own\r\nlabour. And what more can I want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this is your plan,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98for running away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show me a better! My deary, show me a better! Why, I know very well,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid old Betty Higden, \xe2\x80\x98and you know very well, that your lady and\r\ngentleman would set me up like a queen for the rest of my life, if so be\r\nthat we could make it right among us to have it so. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t make it\r\nright among us to have it so. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never took charity yet, nor yet has\r\nany one belonging to me. And it would be forsaking of myself indeed, and\r\nforsaking of my children dead and gone, and forsaking of their children\r\ndead and gone, to set up a contradiction now at last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It might come to be justifiable and unavoidable at last,\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary\r\ngently hinted, with a slight stress on the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it never will! It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that I mean to give offence by being\r\nanyways proud,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old creature simply, \xe2\x80\x98but that I want to be of\r\na piece like, and helpful of myself right through to my death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And to be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 added the Secretary, as a comfort for her, \xe2\x80\x98Sloppy\r\nwill be eagerly looking forward to his opportunity of being to you what\r\nyou have been to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Trust him for that, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x98Though he had need\r\nto be something quick about it, for I\xe2\x80\x99m a getting to be an old one. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a strong one too, and travel and weather never hurt me yet! Now, be\r\nso kind as speak for me to your lady and gentleman, and tell \xe2\x80\x98em what I\r\nask of their good friendliness to let me do, and why I ask it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary felt that there was no gainsaying what was urged by\r\nthis brave old heroine, and he presently repaired to Mrs Boffin and\r\nrecommended her to let Betty Higden have her way, at all events for the\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x98It would be far more satisfactory to your kind heart, I know,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98to provide for her, but it may be a duty to respect this\r\nindependent spirit.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Boffin was not proof against the consideration\r\nset before her. She and her husband had worked too, and had brought\r\ntheir simple faith and honour clean out of dustheaps. If they owed a\r\nduty to Betty Higden, of a surety that duty must be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Betty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, when she accompanied John Rokesmith back\r\nto his room, and shone upon her with the light of her radiant face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98granted all else, I think I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t run away\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twould come easier to Sloppy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Higden, shaking her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twould come easier to me too. But \xe2\x80\x98tis as you please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When would you go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 was the bright and ready answer. \xe2\x80\x98To-day, my deary, to-morrow.\r\nBless ye, I am used to it. I know many parts of the country well. When\r\nnothing else was to be done, I have worked in many a market-garden afore\r\nnow, and in many a hop-garden too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I give my consent to your going, Betty--which Mr Rokesmith thinks I\r\nought to do--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBetty thanked him with a grateful curtsey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--We must not lose sight of you. We must not let you pass out of our\r\nknowledge. We must know all about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my deary, but not through letter-writing, because\r\nletter-writing--indeed, writing of most sorts hadn\xe2\x80\x99t much come up for\r\nsuch as me when I was young. But I shall be to and fro. No fear of\r\nmy missing a chance of giving myself a sight of your reviving face.\r\nBesides,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, with logical good faith, \xe2\x80\x98I shall have a debt to\r\npay off, by littles, and naturally that would bring me back, if nothing\r\nelse would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MUST it be done?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Boffin, still reluctant, of the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter more discussion it was agreed that it should be done, and Mrs\r\nBoffin summoned Bella to note down the little purchases that were\r\nnecessary to set Betty up in trade. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ye be timorous for me, my\r\ndear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the stanch old heart, observant of Bella\xe2\x80\x99s face: \xe2\x80\x98when I\r\ntake my seat with my work, clean and busy and fresh, in a country\r\nmarket-place, I shall turn a sixpence as sure as ever a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary took that opportunity of touching on the practical\r\nquestion of Mr Sloppy\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. He would have made a wonderful\r\ncabinet-maker, said Mrs Higden, \xe2\x80\x98if there had been the money to put him\r\nto it.\xe2\x80\x99 She had seen him handle tools that he had borrowed to mend\r\nthe mangle, or to knock a broken piece of furniture together, in a\r\nsurprising manner. As to constructing toys for the Minders, out of\r\nnothing, he had done that daily. And once as many as a dozen people had\r\ngot together in the lane to see the neatness with which he fitted the\r\nbroken pieces of a foreign monkey\xe2\x80\x99s musical instrument. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s well,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98It will not be hard to find a trade for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn Harmon being buried under mountains now, the Secretary that very\r\nsame day set himself to finish his affairs and have done with him. He\r\ndrew up an ample declaration, to be signed by Rogue Riderhood (knowing\r\nhe could get his signature to it, by making him another and much shorter\r\nevening call), and then considered to whom should he give the document?\r\nTo Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s son, or daughter? Resolved speedily, to the daughter. But it\r\nwould be safer to avoid seeing the daughter, because the son had seen\r\nJulius Handford, and--he could not be too careful--there might possibly\r\nbe some comparison of notes between the son and daughter, which would\r\nawaken slumbering suspicion, and lead to consequences. \xe2\x80\x98I might even,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe reflected, \xe2\x80\x98be apprehended as having been concerned in my own\r\nmurder!\xe2\x80\x99 Therefore, best to send it to the daughter under cover by the\r\npost. Pleasant Riderhood had undertaken to find out where she lived,\r\nand it was not necessary that it should be attended by a single word of\r\nexplanation. So far, straight.\r\n\r\nBut, all that he knew of the daughter he derived from Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccounts of what she heard from Mr Lightwood, who seemed to have a\r\nreputation for his manner of relating a story, and to have made this\r\nstory quite his own. It interested him, and he would like to have\r\nthe means of knowing more--as, for instance, that she received the\r\nexonerating paper, and that it satisfied her--by opening some channel\r\naltogether independent of Lightwood: who likewise had seen Julius\r\nHandford, who had publicly advertised for Julius Handford, and whom\r\nof all men he, the Secretary, most avoided. \xe2\x80\x98But with whom the common\r\ncourse of things might bring me in a moment face to face, any day in the\r\nweek or any hour in the day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, to cast about for some likely means of opening such a channel. The\r\nboy, Hexam, was training for and with a schoolmaster. The Secretary knew\r\nit, because his sister\xe2\x80\x99s share in that disposal of him seemed to be\r\nthe best part of Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s account of the family. This young fellow,\r\nSloppy, stood in need of some instruction. If he, the Secretary, engaged\r\nthat schoolmaster to impart it to him, the channel might be opened. The\r\nnext point was, did Mrs Boffin know the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s name? No, but she\r\nknew where the school was. Quite enough. Promptly the Secretary wrote\r\nto the master of that school, and that very evening Bradley Headstone\r\nanswered in person.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary stated to the schoolmaster how the object was, to send to\r\nhim for certain occasional evening instruction, a youth whom Mr and Mrs\r\nBoffin wished to help to an industrious and useful place in life. The\r\nschoolmaster was willing to undertake the charge of such a pupil. The\r\nSecretary inquired on what terms? The schoolmaster stated on what terms.\r\nAgreed and disposed of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone, \xe2\x80\x98to whose good opinion I owe a\r\nrecommendation to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should know that I am not the principal here. I am Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSecretary. Mr Boffin is a gentleman who inherited a property of which\r\nyou may have heard some public mention; the Harmon property.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Harmon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley: who would have been a great deal more at a\r\nloss than he was, if he had known to whom he spoke: \xe2\x80\x98was murdered and\r\nfound in the river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was murdered and found in the river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the Secretary, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98it was not he who recommended\r\nyou. Mr Boffin heard of you through a certain Mr Lightwood. I think you\r\nknow Mr Lightwood, or know of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know as much of him as I wish to know, sir. I have no acquaintance\r\nwith Mr Lightwood, and I desire none. I have no objection to Mr\r\nLightwood, but I have a particular objection to some of Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends--in short, to one of Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s friends. His great friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe could hardly get the words out, even then and there, so fierce did\r\nhe grow (though keeping himself down with infinite pains of repression),\r\nwhen the careless and contemptuous bearing of Eugene Wrayburn rose\r\nbefore his mind.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary saw there was a strong feeling here on some sore point,\r\nand he would have made a diversion from it, but for Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s holding to\r\nit in his cumbersome way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no objection to mention the friend by name,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, doggedly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The person I object to, is Mr Eugene Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary remembered him. In his disturbed recollection of that\r\nnight when he was striving against the drugged drink, there was but a\r\ndim image of Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s person; but he remembered his name, and his manner\r\nof speaking, and how he had gone with them to view the body, and where\r\nhe had stood, and what he had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, Mr Headstone, what is the name,\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, again trying to make a\r\ndiversion, \xe2\x80\x98of young Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her name is Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said the schoolmaster, with a strong contraction\r\nof his whole face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is a young woman of a remarkable character; is she not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is sufficiently remarkable to be very superior to Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn--though an ordinary person might be that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nschoolmaster; \xe2\x80\x98and I hope you will not think it impertinent in me, sir,\r\nto ask why you put the two names together?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By mere accident,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98Observing that Mr Wrayburn\r\nwas a disagreeable subject with you, I tried to get away from it: though\r\nnot very successfully, it would appear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know Mr Wrayburn, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then perhaps the names cannot be put together on the authority of any\r\nrepresentation of his?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took the liberty to ask,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, after casting his eyes on\r\nthe ground, \xe2\x80\x98because he is capable of making any representation, in the\r\nswaggering levity of his insolence. I--I hope you will not misunderstand\r\nme, sir. I--I am much interested in this brother and sister, and the\r\nsubject awakens very strong feelings within me. Very, very, strong\r\nfeelings.\xe2\x80\x99 With a shaking hand, Bradley took out his handkerchief and\r\nwiped his brow.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary thought, as he glanced at the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s face, that he\r\nhad opened a channel here indeed, and that it was an unexpectedly dark\r\nand deep and stormy one, and difficult to sound. All at once, in the\r\nmidst of his turbulent emotions, Bradley stopped and seemed to challenge\r\nhis look. Much as though he suddenly asked him, \xe2\x80\x98What do you see in me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The brother, young Hexam, was your real recommendation here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nSecretary, quietly going back to the point; \xe2\x80\x98Mr and Mrs Boffin happening\r\nto know, through Mr Lightwood, that he was your pupil. Anything that\r\nI ask respecting the brother and sister, or either of them, I ask for\r\nmyself out of my own interest in the subject, and not in my official\r\ncharacter, or on Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. How I come to be interested, I need\r\nnot explain. You know the father\xe2\x80\x99s connection with the discovery of Mr\r\nHarmon\xe2\x80\x99s body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bradley, very restlessly indeed, \xe2\x80\x98I know all the\r\ncircumstances of that case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray tell me, Mr Headstone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98Does the sister\r\nsuffer under any stigma because of the impossible accusation--groundless\r\nwould be a better word--that was made against the father, and\r\nsubstantially withdrawn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bradley, with a kind of anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad to hear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, separating his words over-carefully, and\r\nspeaking as if he were repeating them from a book, \xe2\x80\x98suffers under no\r\nreproach that repels a man of unimpeachable character who had made\r\nfor himself every step of his way in life, from placing her in his own\r\nstation. I will not say, raising her to his own station; I say, placing\r\nher in it. The sister labours under no reproach, unless she should\r\nunfortunately make it for herself. When such a man is not deterred from\r\nregarding her as his equal, and when he has convinced himself that\r\nthere is no blemish on her, I think the fact must be taken to be pretty\r\nexpressive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there is such a man?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone knotted his brows, and squared his large lower jaw,\r\nand fixed his eyes on the ground with an air of determination that\r\nseemed unnecessary to the occasion, as he replied: \xe2\x80\x98And there is such a\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary had no reason or excuse for prolonging the conversation,\r\nand it ended here. Within three hours the oakum-headed apparition once\r\nmore dived into the Leaving Shop, and that night Rogue Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecantation lay in the post office, addressed under cover to Lizzie\r\nHexam at her right address.\r\n\r\nAll these proceedings occupied John Rokesmith so much, that it was not\r\nuntil the following day that he saw Bella again. It seemed then to be\r\ntacitly understood between them that they were to be as distantly easy\r\nas they could, without attracting the attention of Mr and Mrs Boffin to\r\nany marked change in their manner. The fitting out of old Betty Higden\r\nwas favourable to this, as keeping Bella engaged and interested, and as\r\noccupying the general attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, when they all stood about her, while she\r\npacked her tidy basket--except Bella, who was busily helping on her\r\nknees at the chair on which it stood; \xe2\x80\x98that at least you might keep a\r\nletter in your pocket, Mrs Higden, which I would write for you and date\r\nfrom here, merely stating, in the names of Mr and Mrs Boffin, that they\r\nare your friends;--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say patrons, because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98no patronizing! Let\xe2\x80\x99s keep out of THAT,\r\nwhatever we come to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s more than enough of that about, without us; ain\xe2\x80\x99t there,\r\nNoddy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you, old lady!\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Golden Dustman. \xe2\x80\x98Overmuch\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But people sometimes like to be patronized; don\xe2\x80\x99t they, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked\r\nBella, looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t. And if THEY do, my dear, they ought to learn better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin. \xe2\x80\x98Patrons and Patronesses, and Vice-Patrons and Vice-Patronesses,\r\nand Deceased Patrons and Deceased Patronesses, and Ex-Vice-Patrons and\r\nEx-Vice-Patronesses, what does it all mean in the books of the Charities\r\nthat come pouring in on Rokesmith as he sits among \xe2\x80\x98em pretty well up to\r\nhis neck! If Mr Tom Noakes gives his five shillings ain\xe2\x80\x99t he a Patron,\r\nand if Mrs Jack Styles gives her five shillings ain\xe2\x80\x99t she a Patroness?\r\nWhat the deuce is it all about? If it ain\xe2\x80\x99t stark staring impudence,\r\nwhat do you call it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be warm, Noddy,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Boffin urged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warm!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make a man smoking hot. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo anywhere without being Patronized. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be Patronized. If\r\nI buy a ticket for a Flower Show, or a Music Show, or any sort of Show,\r\nand pay pretty heavy for it, why am I to be Patroned and Patronessed as\r\nif the Patrons and Patronesses treated me? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing to be\r\ndone, can\xe2\x80\x99t it be done on its own merits? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing to\r\nbe done, can it ever be Patroned and Patronessed right? Yet when a new\r\nInstitution\xe2\x80\x99s going to be built, it seems to me that the bricks and\r\nmortar ain\xe2\x80\x99t made of half so much consequence as the Patrons and\r\nPatronesses; no, nor yet the objects. I wish somebody would tell me\r\nwhether other countries get Patronized to anything like the extent of\r\nthis one! And as to the Patrons and Patronesses themselves, I wonder\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re not ashamed of themselves. They ain\xe2\x80\x99t Pills, or Hair-Washes, or\r\nInvigorating Nervous Essences, to be puffed in that way!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of these remarks, Mr Boffin took a trot,\r\naccording to his usual custom, and trotted back to the spot from which\r\nhe had started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to the letter, Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re as right as a\r\ntrivet. Give her the letter, make her take the letter, put it in her\r\npocket by violence. She might fall sick. You know you might fall sick,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, Mrs Higden, in your obstinacy; you know\r\nyou might.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOld Betty laughed, and said that she would take the letter and be\r\nthankful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Come! That\xe2\x80\x99s sensible. And don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nthankful to us (for we never thought of it), but to Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe letter was written, and read to her, and given to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, how do you feel?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The letter, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty. \xe2\x80\x98Ay, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful letter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no; not the letter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98the idea. Are you sure\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re strong enough to carry out the idea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be stronger, and keep the deadness off better, this way, than\r\nany way left open to me, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say than any way left open, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98because\r\nthere are ways without end. A housekeeper would be acceptable over\r\nyonder at the Bower, for instance. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to see the\r\nBower, and know a retired literary man of the name of Wegg that lives\r\nthere--WITH a wooden leg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOld Betty was proof even against this temptation, and fell to adjusting\r\nher black bonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let you go, now it comes to this, after all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin, \xe2\x80\x98if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hope that it may make a man and a workman of\r\nSloppy, in as short a time as ever a man and workman was made yet. Why,\r\nwhat have you got there, Betty? Not a doll?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the man in the Guards who had been on duty over Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\nThe solitary old woman showed what it was, and put it up quietly in her\r\ndress. Then, she gratefully took leave of Mrs Boffin, and of Mr Boffin,\r\nand of Rokesmith, and then put her old withered arms round Bella\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nand blooming neck, and said, repeating Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x98A kiss for the\r\nboofer lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary looked on from a doorway at the boofer lady thus\r\nencircled, and still looked on at the boofer lady standing alone there,\r\nwhen the determined old figure with its steady bright eyes was trudging\r\nthrough the streets, away from paralysis and pauperism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nTHE WHOLE CASE SO FAR\r\n\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone held fast by that other interview he was to have with\r\nLizzie Hexam. In stipulating for it, he had been impelled by a feeling\r\nlittle short of desperation, and the feeling abided by him. It was very\r\nsoon after his interview with the Secretary, that he and Charley Hexam\r\nset out one leaden evening, not unnoticed by Miss Peecher, to have this\r\ndesperate interview accomplished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, \xe2\x80\x98is favourable neither to me nor\r\nto you, Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A pert crooked little chit, Mr Headstone! I knew she would put herself\r\nin the way, if she could, and would be sure to strike in with something\r\nimpertinent. It was on that account that I proposed our going to the\r\nCity to-night and meeting my sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I supposed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, getting his gloves on his nervous hands\r\nas he walked. \xe2\x80\x98So I supposed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nobody but my sister,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Charley, \xe2\x80\x98would have found out such an\r\nextraordinary companion. She has done it in a ridiculous fancy of giving\r\nherself up to another. She told me so, that night when we went there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should she give herself up to the dressmaker?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, colouring. \xe2\x80\x98One of her romantic ideas! I tried to\r\nconvince her so, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed. However, what we have got to do,\r\nis, to succeed to-night, Mr Headstone, and then all the rest follows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are still sanguine, Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I am, sir. Why, we have everything on our side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except your sister, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bradley. But he only gloomily\r\nthought it, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything on our side,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the boy with boyish confidence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Respectability, an excellent connexion for me, common sense,\r\neverything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, your sister has always shown herself a devoted sister,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Bradley, willing to sustain himself on even that low ground of\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Naturally, Mr Headstone, I have a good deal of influence with her.\r\nAnd now that you have honoured me with your confidence and spoken to me\r\nfirst, I say again, we have everything on our side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Bradley thought again, \xe2\x80\x98Except your sister, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA grey dusty withered evening in London city has not a hopeful aspect.\r\nThe closed warehouses and offices have an air of death about them, and\r\nthe national dread of colour has an air of mourning. The towers and\r\nsteeples of the many house-encompassed churches, dark and dingy as the\r\nsky that seems descending on them, are no relief to the general gloom;\r\na sun-dial on a church-wall has the look, in its useless black shade, of\r\nhaving failed in its business enterprise and stopped payment for ever;\r\nmelancholy waifs and strays of housekeepers and porter sweep melancholy\r\nwaifs and strays of papers and pins into the kennels, and other more\r\nmelancholy waifs and strays explore them, searching and stooping and\r\npoking for anything to sell. The set of humanity outward from the City\r\nis as a set of prisoners departing from gaol, and dismal Newgate\r\nseems quite as fit a stronghold for the mighty Lord Mayor as his own\r\nstate-dwelling.\r\n\r\nOn such an evening, when the city grit gets into the hair and eyes and\r\nskin, and when the fallen leaves of the few unhappy city trees grind\r\ndown in corners under wheels of wind, the schoolmaster and the pupil\r\nemerged upon the Leadenhall Street region, spying eastward for Lizzie.\r\nBeing something too soon in their arrival, they lurked at a corner,\r\nwaiting for her to appear. The best-looking among us will not look very\r\nwell, lurking at a corner, and Bradley came out of that disadvantage\r\nvery poorly indeed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here she comes, Mr Headstone! Let us go forward and meet her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs they advanced, she saw them coming, and seemed rather troubled. But\r\nshe greeted her brother with the usual warmth, and touched the extended\r\nhand of Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, where are you going, Charley, dear?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked him then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nowhere. We came on purpose to meet you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To meet me, Charley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. We are going to walk with you. But don\xe2\x80\x99t let us take the great\r\nleading streets where every one walks, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t hear ourselves\r\nspeak. Let us go by the quiet backways. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a large paved court by\r\nthis church, and quiet, too. Let us go up here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the way, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, petulantly. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s in my way, and my way is\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had not released his hand, and, still holding it, looked at him with\r\na kind of appeal. He avoided her eyes, under pretence of saying, \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nalong, Mr Headstone.\xe2\x80\x99 Bradley walked at his side--not at hers--and the\r\nbrother and sister walked hand in hand. The court brought them to a\r\nchurchyard; a paved square court, with a raised bank of earth about\r\nbreast high, in the middle, enclosed by iron rails. Here, conveniently\r\nand healthfully elevated above the level of the living, were the dead,\r\nand the tombstones; some of the latter droopingly inclined from the\r\nperpendicular, as if they were ashamed of the lies they told.\r\n\r\nThey paced the whole of this place once, in a constrained and\r\nuncomfortable manner, when the boy stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie, Mr Headstone has something to say to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be an\r\ninterruption either to him or to you, and so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and take a little\r\nstroll and come back. I know in a general way what Mr Headstone intends\r\nto say, and I very highly approve of it, as I hope--and indeed I do\r\nnot doubt--you will. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, Lizzie, that I am under great\r\nobligations to Mr Headstone, and that I am very anxious for Mr Headstone\r\nto succeed in all he undertakes. As I hope--and as, indeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndoubt--you must be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley,\xe2\x80\x99 returned his sister, detaining his hand as he withdrew it, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthink you had better stay. I think Mr Headstone had better not say what\r\nhe thinks of saying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, how do you know what it is?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t? No, Liz, I should think not. If you knew what\r\nit was, you would give me a very different answer. There; let go; be\r\nsensible. I wonder you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that Mr Headstone is looking on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe allowed him to separate himself from her, and he, after saying, \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\nLiz, be a rational girl and a good sister,\xe2\x80\x99 walked away. She remained\r\nstanding alone with Bradley Headstone, and it was not until she raised\r\nher eyes, that he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98when I saw you last, that there was something\r\nunexplained, which might perhaps influence you. I have come this evening\r\nto explain it. I hope you will not judge of me by my hesitating manner\r\nwhen I speak to you. You see me at my greatest disadvantage. It is most\r\nunfortunate for me that I wish you to see me at my best, and that I know\r\nyou see me at my worst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe moved slowly on when he paused, and he moved slowly on beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems egotistical to begin by saying so much about myself,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nresumed, \xe2\x80\x98but whatever I say to you seems, even in my own ears, below\r\nwhat I want to say, and different from what I want to say. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit. So it is. You are the ruin of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe started at the passionate sound of the last words, and at the\r\npassionate action of his hands, with which they were accompanied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes! you are the ruin--the ruin--the ruin--of me. I have no resources\r\nin myself, I have no confidence in myself, I have no government of\r\nmyself when you are near me or in my thoughts. And you are always in my\r\nthoughts now. I have never been quit of you since I first saw you. Oh,\r\nthat was a wretched day for me! That was a wretched, miserable day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA touch of pity for him mingled with her dislike of him, and she said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, I am grieved to have done you any harm, but I have never\r\nmeant it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, despairingly. \xe2\x80\x98Now, I seem to have reproached you,\r\ninstead of revealing to you the state of my own mind! Bear with me. I am\r\nalways wrong when you are in question. It is my doom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStruggling with himself, and by times looking up at the deserted windows\r\nof the houses as if there could be anything written in their grimy panes\r\nthat would help him, he paced the whole pavement at her side, before he\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must try to give expression to what is in my mind; it shall and must\r\nbe spoken. Though you see me so confounded--though you strike me so\r\nhelpless--I ask you to believe that there are many people who think well\r\nof me; that there are some people who highly esteem me; that I have in\r\nmy way won a Station which is considered worth winning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely, Mr Headstone, I do believe it. Surely I have always known it\r\nfrom Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ask you to believe that if I were to offer my home such as it is, my\r\nstation such as it is, my affections such as they are, to any one of the\r\nbest considered, and best qualified, and most distinguished, among the\r\nyoung women engaged in my calling, they would probably be accepted. Even\r\nreadily accepted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not doubt it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, with her eyes upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have sometimes had it in my thoughts to make that offer and to settle\r\ndown as many men of my class do: I on the one side of a school, my wife\r\non the other, both of us interested in the same work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why have you not done so?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lizzie Hexam. \xe2\x80\x98Why do you not do so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Far better that I never did! The only one grain of comfort I have had\r\nthese many weeks,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, always speaking passionately, and, when\r\nmost emphatic, repeating that former action of his hands, which was\r\nlike flinging his heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood down before her in drops upon the\r\npavement-stones; \xe2\x80\x98the only one grain of comfort I have had these many\r\nweeks is, that I never did. For if I had, and if the same spell had come\r\nupon me for my ruin, I know I should have broken that tie asunder as if\r\nit had been thread.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him with a glance of fear, and a shrinking gesture. He\r\nanswered, as if she had spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! It would not have been voluntary on my part, any more than it is\r\nvoluntary in me to be here now. You draw me to you. If I were shut up in\r\na strong prison, you would draw me out. I should break through the wall\r\nto come to you. If I were lying on a sick bed, you would draw me up--to\r\nstagger to your feet and fall there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wild energy of the man, now quite let loose, was absolutely\r\nterrible. He stopped and laid his hand upon a piece of the coping of the\r\nburial-ground enclosure, as if he would have dislodged the stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No man knows till the time comes, what depths are within him. To some\r\nmen it never comes; let them rest and be thankful! To me, you brought\r\nit; on me, you forced it; and the bottom of this raging sea,\xe2\x80\x99 striking\r\nhimself upon the breast, \xe2\x80\x98has been heaved up ever since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, I have heard enough. Let me stop you here. It will be\r\nbetter for you and better for me. Let us find my brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not yet. It shall and must be spoken. I have been in torments ever\r\nsince I stopped short of it before. You are alarmed. It is another of my\r\nmiseries that I cannot speak to you or speak of you without stumbling at\r\nevery syllable, unless I let the check go altogether and run mad. Here\r\nis a man lighting the lamps. He will be gone directly. I entreat of you\r\nlet us walk round this place again. You have no reason to look alarmed;\r\nI can restrain myself, and I will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe yielded to the entreaty--how could she do otherwise!--and they paced\r\nthe stones in silence. One by one the lights leaped up making the cold\r\ngrey church tower more remote, and they were alone again. He said no\r\nmore until they had regained the spot where he had broken off; there, he\r\nagain stood still, and again grasped the stone. In saying what he said\r\nthen, he never looked at her; but looked at it and wrenched at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know what I am going to say. I love you. What other men may mean\r\nwhen they use that expression, I cannot tell; what I mean is, that I am\r\nunder the influence of some tremendous attraction which I have resisted\r\nin vain, and which overmasters me. You could draw me to fire, you could\r\ndraw me to water, you could draw me to the gallows, you could draw me to\r\nany death, you could draw me to anything I have most avoided, you could\r\ndraw me to any exposure and disgrace. This and the confusion of my\r\nthoughts, so that I am fit for nothing, is what I mean by your being the\r\nruin of me. But if you would return a favourable answer to my offer\r\nof myself in marriage, you could draw me to any good--every good--with\r\nequal force. My circumstances are quite easy, and you would want for\r\nnothing. My reputation stands quite high, and would be a shield for\r\nyours. If you saw me at my work, able to do it well and respected in\r\nit, you might even come to take a sort of pride in me;--I would try hard\r\nthat you should. Whatever considerations I may have thought of against\r\nthis offer, I have conquered, and I make it with all my heart. Your\r\nbrother favours me to the utmost, and it is likely that we might live\r\nand work together; anyhow, it is certain that he would have my best\r\ninfluence and support. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I could say more if I tried. I\r\nmight only weaken what is ill enough said as it is. I only add that\r\nif it is any claim on you to be in earnest, I am in thorough earnest,\r\ndreadful earnest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe powdered mortar from under the stone at which he wrenched, rattled\r\non the pavement to confirm his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop! I implore you, before you answer me, to walk round this place\r\nonce more. It will give you a minute\xe2\x80\x99s time to think, and me a minute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime to get some fortitude together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain she yielded to the entreaty, and again they came back to the same\r\nplace, and again he worked at the stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with his attention apparently engrossed by it, \xe2\x80\x98yes,\r\nor no?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, I thank you sincerely, I thank you gratefully, and hope\r\nyou may find a worthy wife before long and be very happy. But it is no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is no short time necessary for reflection; no weeks or days?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked,\r\nin the same half-suffocated way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None whatever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you quite decided, and is there no chance of any change in my\r\nfavour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am quite decided, Mr Headstone, and I am bound to answer I am certain\r\nthere is none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, suddenly changing his tone and turning to her, and\r\nbringing his clenched hand down upon the stone with a force that laid\r\nthe knuckles raw and bleeding; \xe2\x80\x98then I hope that I may never kill him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dark look of hatred and revenge with which the words broke from his\r\nlivid lips, and with which he stood holding out his smeared hand as\r\nif it held some weapon and had just struck a mortal blow, made her so\r\nafraid of him that she turned to run away. But he caught her by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, let me go. Mr Headstone, I must call for help!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is I who should call for help,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet how\r\nmuch I need it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe working of his face as she shrank from it, glancing round for her\r\nbrother and uncertain what to do, might have extorted a cry from her in\r\nanother instant; but all at once he sternly stopped it and fixed it, as\r\nif Death itself had done so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There! You see I have recovered myself. Hear me out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith much of the dignity of courage, as she recalled her self-reliant\r\nlife and her right to be free from accountability to this man, she\r\nreleased her arm from his grasp and stood looking full at him. She had\r\nnever been so handsome, in his eyes. A shade came over them while\r\nhe looked back at her, as if she drew the very light out of them to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This time, at least, I will leave nothing unsaid,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, folding\r\nhis hands before him, clearly to prevent his being betrayed into any\r\nimpetuous gesture; \xe2\x80\x98this last time at least I will not be tortured with\r\nafter-thoughts of a lost opportunity. Mr Eugene Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it of him you spoke in your ungovernable rage and violence?\xe2\x80\x99 Lizzie\r\nHexam demanded with spirit.\r\n\r\nHe bit his lip, and looked at her, and said never a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it Mr Wrayburn that you threatened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe bit his lip again, and looked at her, and said never a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You asked me to hear you out, and you will not speak. Let me find my\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay! I threatened no one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer look dropped for an instant to his bleeding hand. He lifted it to\r\nhis mouth, wiped it on his sleeve, and again folded it over the other.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Eugene Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you mention that name again and again, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because it is the text of the little I have left to say. Observe! There\r\nare no threats in it. If I utter a threat, stop me, and fasten it upon\r\nme. Mr Eugene Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA worse threat than was conveyed in his manner of uttering the name,\r\ncould hardly have escaped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He haunts you. You accept favours from him. You are willing enough to\r\nlisten to HIM. I know it, as well as he does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn has been considerate and good to me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie,\r\nproudly, \xe2\x80\x98in connexion with the death and with the memory of my poor\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No doubt. He is of course a very considerate and a very good man, Mr\r\nEugene Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is nothing to you, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, with an indignation she\r\ncould not repress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, he is. There you mistake. He is much to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What can he be to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can be a rival to me among other things,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie, with a burning face, \xe2\x80\x98it is cowardly in\r\nyou to speak to me in this way. But it makes me able to tell you that\r\nI do not like you, and that I never have liked you from the first, and\r\nthat no other living creature has anything to do with the effect you\r\nhave produced upon me for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis head bent for a moment, as if under a weight, and he then looked up\r\nagain, moistening his lips. \xe2\x80\x98I was going on with the little I had left\r\nto say. I knew all this about Mr Eugene Wrayburn, all the while you were\r\ndrawing me to you. I strove against the knowledge, but quite in vain. It\r\nmade no difference in me. With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind, I went\r\non. With Mr Eugene Wrayburn in my mind, I spoke to you just now. With Mr\r\nEugene Wrayburn in my mind, I have been set aside and I have been cast\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you give those names to my thanking you for your proposal\r\nand declining it, is it my fault, Mr Headstone?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie,\r\ncompassionating the bitter struggle he could not conceal, almost as much\r\nas she was repelled and alarmed by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not complaining,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, \xe2\x80\x98I am only stating the case. I had\r\nto wrestle with my self-respect when I submitted to be drawn to you in\r\nspite of Mr Wrayburn. You may imagine how low my self-respect lies now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was hurt and angry; but repressed herself in consideration of his\r\nsuffering, and of his being her brother\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it lies under his feet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, unfolding his hands in spite\r\nof himself, and fiercely motioning with them both towards the stones of\r\nthe pavement. \xe2\x80\x98Remember that! It lies under that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and he\r\ntreads upon it and exults above it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He does not!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He does!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley. \xe2\x80\x98I have stood before him face to face, and he\r\ncrushed me down in the dirt of his contempt, and walked over me. Why?\r\nBecause he knew with triumph what was in store for me to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Mr Headstone, you talk quite wildly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite collectedly. I know what I say too well. Now I have said all. I\r\nhave used no threat, remember; I have done no more than show you how the\r\ncase stands;--how the case stands, so far.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this moment her brother sauntered into view close by. She darted to\r\nhim, and caught him by the hand. Bradley followed, and laid his heavy\r\nhand on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s opposite shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley Hexam, I am going home. I must walk home by myself to-night,\r\nand get shut up in my room without being spoken to. Give me half an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s start, and let me be, till you find me at my work in the morning.\r\nI shall be at my work in the morning just as usual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClasping his hands, he uttered a short unearthly broken cry, and went\r\nhis way. The brother and sister were left looking at one another near\r\na lamp in the solitary churchyard, and the boy\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded and\r\ndarkened, as he said in a rough tone: \xe2\x80\x98What is the meaning of this? What\r\nhave you done to my best friend? Out with the truth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley!\xe2\x80\x99 said his sister. \xe2\x80\x98Speak a little more considerately!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not in the humour for consideration, or for nonsense of any sort,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied the boy. \xe2\x80\x98What have you been doing? Why has Mr Headstone gone\r\nfrom us in that way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He asked me--you know he asked me--to be his wife, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I was obliged to tell him that I could not be his wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were obliged to tell him,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the boy angrily, between his\r\nteeth, and rudely pushing her away. \xe2\x80\x98You were obliged to tell him! Do\r\nyou know that he is worth fifty of you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It may easily be so, Charley, but I cannot marry him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean that you are conscious that you can\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate him, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t deserve him, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean that I do not like him, Charley, and that I will never marry\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my soul,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the boy, \xe2\x80\x98you are a nice picture of a sister!\r\nUpon my soul, you are a pretty piece of disinterestedness! And so all my\r\nendeavours to cancel the past and to raise myself in the world, and to\r\nraise you with me, are to be beaten down by YOUR low whims; are they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not reproach you, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear her!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the boy, looking round at the darkness. \xe2\x80\x98She won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreproach me! She does her best to destroy my fortunes and her own,\r\nand she won\xe2\x80\x99t reproach me! Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me, next, that you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreproach Mr Headstone for coming out of the sphere to which he is an\r\nornament, and putting himself at YOUR feet, to be rejected by YOU!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Charley; I will only tell you, as I told himself, that I thank him\r\nfor doing so, that I am sorry he did so, and that I hope he will do much\r\nbetter, and be happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSome touch of compunction smote the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hardening heart as he looked\r\nupon her, his patient little nurse in infancy, his patient friend,\r\nadviser, and reclaimer in boyhood, the self-forgetting sister who had\r\ndone everything for him. His tone relented, and he drew her arm through\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, come, Liz; don\xe2\x80\x99t let us quarrel: let us be reasonable and talk\r\nthis over like brother and sister. Will you listen to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Charley!\xe2\x80\x99 she replied through her starting tears; \xe2\x80\x98do I not listen\r\nto you, and hear many hard things!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I am sorry. There, Liz! I am unfeignedly sorry. Only you do put me\r\nout so. Now see. Mr Headstone is perfectly devoted to you. He has told\r\nme in the strongest manner that he has never been his old self for one\r\nsingle minute since I first brought him to see you. Miss Peecher, our\r\nschoolmistress--pretty and young, and all that--is known to be very much\r\nattached to him, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t so much as look at her or hear of her.\r\nNow, his devotion to you must be a disinterested one; mustn\xe2\x80\x99t it? If he\r\nmarried Miss Peecher, he would be a great deal better off in all worldly\r\nrespects, than in marrying you. Well then; he has nothing to get by it,\r\nhas he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, Heaven knows!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy; \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s something in his favour, and a\r\ngreat thing. Then I come in. Mr Headstone has always got me on, and he\r\nhas a good deal in his power, and of course if he was my brother-in-law\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get me on less, but would get me on more. Mr Headstone\r\ncomes and confides in me, in a very delicate way, and says, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope my\r\nmarrying your sister would be agreeable to you, Hexam, and useful to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d I say, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the world, Mr Headstone, that I could\r\nbe better pleased with.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Headstone says, \xe2\x80\x9cThen I may rely upon your\r\nintimate knowledge of me for your good word with your sister, Hexam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And I say, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Mr Headstone, and naturally I have a good deal of\r\ninfluence with her.\xe2\x80\x9d So I have; haven\xe2\x80\x99t I, Liz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Charley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well said! Now, you see, we begin to get on, the moment we begin to\r\nbe really talking it over, like brother and sister. Very well. Then\r\nYOU come in. As Mr Headstone\xe2\x80\x99s wife you would be occupying a most\r\nrespectable station, and you would be holding a far better place in\r\nsociety than you hold now, and you would at length get quit of the\r\nriver-side and the old disagreeables belonging to it, and you would be\r\nrid for good of dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmakers and their drunken fathers, and the\r\nlike of that. Not that I want to disparage Miss Jenny Wren: I dare\r\nsay she is all very well in her way; but her way is not your way as\r\nMr Headstone\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Now, you see, Liz, on all three accounts--on\r\nMr Headstone\xe2\x80\x99s, on mine, on yours--nothing could be better or more\r\ndesirable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were walking slowly as the boy spoke, and here he stood still, to\r\nsee what effect he had made. His sister\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed upon him; but\r\nas they showed no yielding, and as she remained silent, he walked her on\r\nagain. There was some discomfiture in his tone as he resumed, though he\r\ntried to conceal it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having so much influence with you, Liz, as I have, perhaps I should\r\nhave done better to have had a little chat with you in the first\r\ninstance, before Mr Headstone spoke for himself. But really all this in\r\nhis favour seemed so plain and undeniable, and I knew you to have always\r\nbeen so reasonable and sensible, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider it worth while.\r\nVery likely that was a mistake of mine. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s soon set right.\r\nAll that need be done to set it right, is for you to tell me at once\r\nthat I may go home and tell Mr Headstone that what has taken place is\r\nnot final, and that it will all come round by-and-by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped again. The pale face looked anxiously and lovingly at him,\r\nbut she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very unwilling to speak, Charley. If I must, I must. I cannot\r\nauthorize you to say any such thing to Mr Headstone: I cannot allow you\r\nto say any such thing to Mr Headstone. Nothing remains to be said to him\r\nfrom me, after what I have said for good and all, to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this girl,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the boy, contemptuously throwing her off again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98calls herself a sister!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley, dear, that is the second time that you have almost struck\r\nme. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be hurt by my words. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean--Heaven forbid!--that you\r\nintended it; but you hardly know with what a sudden swing you removed\r\nyourself from me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However!\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, taking no heed of the remonstrance, and\r\npursuing his own mortified disappointment, \xe2\x80\x98I know what this means, and\r\nyou shall not disgrace me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It means what I have told you, Charley, and nothing more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy in a violent tone, \xe2\x80\x98and you know it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot. It means your precious Mr Wrayburn; that\xe2\x80\x99s what it means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley! If you remember any old days of ours together, forbear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you shall not disgrace me,\xe2\x80\x99 doggedly pursued the boy. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\ndetermined that after I have climbed up out of the mire, you shall not\r\npull me down. You can\xe2\x80\x99t disgrace me if I have nothing to do with you,\r\nand I will have nothing to do with you for the future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charley! On many a night like this, and many a worse night, I have sat\r\non the stones of the street, hushing you in my arms. Unsay those words\r\nwithout even saying you are sorry for them, and my arms are open to you\r\nstill, and so is my heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll not unsay them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say them again. You are an inveterately bad\r\ngirl, and a false sister, and I have done with you. For ever, I have\r\ndone with you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe threw up his ungrateful and ungracious hand as if it set up a barrier\r\nbetween them, and flung himself upon his heel and left her. She remained\r\nimpassive on the same spot, silent and motionless, until the striking\r\nof the church clock roused her, and she turned away. But then, with the\r\nbreaking up of her immobility came the breaking up of the waters that\r\nthe cold heart of the selfish boy had frozen. And \xe2\x80\x98O that I were lying\r\nhere with the dead!\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98O Charley, Charley, that this should be the\r\nend of our pictures in the fire!\xe2\x80\x99 were all the words she said, as she\r\nlaid her face in her hands on the stone coping.\r\n\r\nA figure passed by, and passed on, but stopped and looked round at\r\nher. It was the figure of an old man with a bowed head, wearing a large\r\nbrimmed low-crowned hat, and a long-skirted coat. After hesitating a\r\nlittle, the figure turned back, and, advancing with an air of gentleness\r\nand compassion, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, young woman, for speaking to you, but you are under some\r\ndistress of mind. I cannot pass upon my way and leave you weeping here\r\nalone, as if there was nothing in the place. Can I help you? Can I do\r\nanything to give you comfort?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe raised her head at the sound of these kind words, and answered\r\ngladly, \xe2\x80\x98O, Mr Riah, is it you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My daughter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, \xe2\x80\x98I stand amazed! I spoke as to a\r\nstranger. Take my arm, take my arm. What grieves you? Who has done this?\r\nPoor girl, poor girl!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My brother has quarrelled with me,\xe2\x80\x99 sobbed Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98and renounced me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a thankless dog,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Jew, angrily. \xe2\x80\x98Let him go. Shake the\r\ndust from thy feet and let him go. Come, daughter! Come home with me--it\r\nis but across the road--and take a little time to recover your peace and\r\nto make your eyes seemly, and then I will bear you company through the\r\nstreets. For it is past your usual time, and will soon be late, and the\r\nway is long, and there is much company out of doors to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe accepted the support he offered her, and they slowly passed out\r\nof the churchyard. They were in the act of emerging into the main\r\nthoroughfare, when another figure loitering discontentedly by, and\r\nlooking up the street and down it, and all about, started and exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie! why, where have you been? Why, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Eugene Wrayburn thus addressed her, she drew closer to the Jew, and\r\nbent her head. The Jew having taken in the whole of Eugene at one sharp\r\nglance, cast his eyes upon the ground, and stood mute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn, I cannot tell you now. I cannot tell you to-night, if I\r\never can tell you. Pray leave me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Lizzie, I came expressly to join you. I came to walk home with\r\nyou, having dined at a coffee-house in this neighbourhood and knowing\r\nyour hour. And I have been lingering about,\xe2\x80\x99 added Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98like a\r\nbailiff; or,\xe2\x80\x99 with a look at Riah, \xe2\x80\x98an old clothesman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Jew lifted up his eyes, and took in Eugene once more, at another\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn, pray, pray, leave me with this protector. And one thing\r\nmore. Pray, pray be careful of yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mysteries of Udolpho!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, with a look of wonder. \xe2\x80\x98May I be\r\nexcused for asking, in the elderly gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s presence, who is this\r\nkind protector?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A trustworthy friend,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will relieve him of his trust,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98But you must tell\r\nme, Lizzie, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her brother is the matter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, lifting up his eyes\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our brother the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, with airy contempt. \xe2\x80\x98Our\r\nbrother is not worth a thought, far less a tear. What has our brother\r\ndone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man lifted up his eyes again, with one grave look at Wrayburn,\r\nand one grave glance at Lizzie, as she stood looking down. Both were so\r\nfull of meaning that even Eugene was checked in his light career, and\r\nsubsided into a thoughtful \xe2\x80\x98Humph!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith an air of perfect patience the old man, remaining mute and keeping\r\nhis eyes cast down, stood, retaining Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as though in his\r\nhabit of passive endurance, it would be all one to him if he had stood\r\nthere motionless all night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Mr Aaron,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, who soon found this fatiguing, \xe2\x80\x98will be good\r\nenough to relinquish his charge to me, he will be quite free for any\r\nengagement he may have at the Synagogue. Mr Aaron, will you have the\r\nkindness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the old man stood stock still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, Mr Aaron,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, politely; \xe2\x80\x98we need not detain\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 Then turning to Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98Is our friend Mr Aaron a little deaf?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My hearing is very good, Christian gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old man,\r\ncalmly; \xe2\x80\x98but I will hear only one voice to-night, desiring me to leave\r\nthis damsel before I have conveyed her to her home. If she requests it,\r\nI will do it. I will do it for no one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask why so, Mr Aaron?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, quite undisturbed in his\r\nease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse me. If she asks me, I will tell her,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old man. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill tell no one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not ask you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98and I beg you to take me home. Mr\r\nWrayburn, I have had a bitter trial to-night, and I hope you will not\r\nthink me ungrateful, or mysterious, or changeable. I am neither; I am\r\nwretched. Pray remember what I said to you. Pray, pray, take care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, in a low voice, bending over her on the\r\nother side; \xe2\x80\x98of what? Of whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of any one you have lately seen and made angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe snapped his fingers and laughed. \xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98since no better\r\nmay be, Mr Aaron and I will divide this trust, and see you home\r\ntogether. Mr Aaron on that side; I on this. If perfectly agreeable to Mr\r\nAaron, the escort will now proceed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe knew his power over her. He knew that she would not insist upon his\r\nleaving her. He knew that, her fears for him being aroused, she would\r\nbe uneasy if he were out of her sight. For all his seeming levity and\r\ncarelessness, he knew whatever he chose to know of the thoughts of her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnd going on at her side, so gaily, regardless of all that had been\r\nurged against him; so superior in his sallies and self-possession to\r\nthe gloomy constraint of her suitor and the selfish petulance of her\r\nbrother; so faithful to her, as it seemed, when her own stock was\r\nfaithless; what an immense advantage, what an overpowering influence,\r\nwere his that night! Add to the rest, poor girl, that she had heard him\r\nvilified for her sake, and that she had suffered for his, and where the\r\nwonder that his occasional tones of serious interest (setting off his\r\ncarelessness, as if it were assumed to calm her), that his lightest\r\ntouch, his lightest look, his very presence beside her in the dark\r\ncommon street, were like glimpses of an enchanted world, which it was\r\nnatural for jealousy and malice and all meanness to be unable to bear\r\nthe brightness of, and to gird at as bad spirits might.\r\n\r\nNothing more being said of repairing to Riah\xe2\x80\x99s, they went direct to\r\nLizzie\xe2\x80\x99s lodging. A little short of the house-door she parted from them,\r\nand went in alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Aaron,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, when they were left together in the street,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98with many thanks for your company, it remains for me unwillingly to say\r\nFarewell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other, \xe2\x80\x98I give you good night, and I wish that you\r\nwere not so thoughtless.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Aaron,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I give you good night, and I wish (for you\r\nare a little dull) that you were not so thoughtful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut now, that his part was played out for the evening, and when in\r\nturning his back upon the Jew he came off the stage, he was thoughtful\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x98How did Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s catechism run?\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured, as he stopped\r\nto light his cigar. \xe2\x80\x98What is to come of it? What are you doing? Where\r\nare you going? We shall soon know now. Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\nThe heavy sigh was repeated as if by an echo, an hour afterwards, when\r\nRiah, who had been sitting on some dark steps in a corner over against\r\nthe house, arose and went his patient way; stealing through the streets\r\nin his ancient dress, like the ghost of a departed Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nAN ANNIVERSARY OCCASION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe estimable Twemlow, dressing himself in his lodgings over the\r\nstable-yard in Duke Street, Saint James\xe2\x80\x99s, and hearing the horses at\r\ntheir toilette below, finds himself on the whole in a disadvantageous\r\nposition as compared with the noble animals at livery. For whereas, on\r\nthe one hand, he has no attendant to slap him soundingly and require him\r\nin gruff accents to come up and come over, still, on the other hand,\r\nhe has no attendant at all; and the mild gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s finger-joints and\r\nother joints working rustily in the morning, he could deem it agreeable\r\neven to be tied up by the countenance at his chamber-door, so he were\r\nthere skilfully rubbed down and slushed and sluiced and polished and\r\nclothed, while himself taking merely a passive part in these trying\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\nHow the fascinating Tippins gets on when arraying herself for the\r\nbewilderment of the senses of men, is known only to the Graces and her\r\nmaid; but perhaps even that engaging creature, though not reduced to\r\nthe self-dependence of Twemlow could dispense with a good deal of the\r\ntrouble attendant on the daily restoration of her charms, seeing that\r\nas to her face and neck this adorable divinity is, as it were, a diurnal\r\nspecies of lobster--throwing off a shell every forenoon, and needing to\r\nkeep in a retired spot until the new crust hardens.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, Twemlow doth at length invest himself with collar and cravat\r\nand wristbands to his knuckles, and goeth forth to breakfast. And to\r\nbreakfast with whom but his near neighbours, the Lammles of Sackville\r\nStreet, who have imparted to him that he will meet his distant kinsman,\r\nMr Fledgely. The awful Snigsworth might taboo and prohibit Fledgely, but\r\nthe peaceable Twemlow reasons, If he IS my kinsman I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make him so,\r\nand to meet a man is not to know him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is the first anniversary of the happy marriage of Mr and Mrs Lammle,\r\nand the celebration is a breakfast, because a dinner on the desired\r\nscale of sumptuosity cannot be achieved within less limits than those\r\nof the non-existent palatial residence of which so many people are\r\nmadly envious. So, Twemlow trips with not a little stiffness across\r\nPiccadilly, sensible of having once been more upright in figure and less\r\nin danger of being knocked down by swift vehicles. To be sure that was\r\nin the days when he hoped for leave from the dread Snigsworth to do\r\nsomething, or be something, in life, and before that magnificent Tartar\r\nissued the ukase, \xe2\x80\x98As he will never distinguish himself, he must be a\r\npoor gentleman-pensioner of mine, and let him hereby consider himself\r\npensioned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAh! my Twemlow! Say, little feeble grey personage, what thoughts are in\r\nthy breast to-day, of the Fancy--so still to call her who bruised thy\r\nheart when it was green and thy head brown--and whether it be better or\r\nworse, more painful or less, to believe in the Fancy to this hour, than\r\nto know her for a greedy armour-plated crocodile, with no more capacity\r\nof imagining the delicate and sensitive and tender spot behind thy\r\nwaistcoat, than of going straight at it with a knitting-needle. Say\r\nlikewise, my Twemlow, whether it be the happier lot to be a poor\r\nrelation of the great, or to stand in the wintry slush giving the hack\r\nhorses to drink out of the shallow tub at the coach-stand, into which\r\nthou has so nearly set thy uncertain foot. Twemlow says nothing, and\r\ngoes on.\r\n\r\nAs he approaches the Lammles\xe2\x80\x99 door, drives up a little one-horse\r\ncarriage, containing Tippins the divine. Tippins, letting down the\r\nwindow, playfully extols the vigilance of her cavalier in being in\r\nwaiting there to hand her out. Twemlow hands her out with as much polite\r\ngravity as if she were anything real, and they proceed upstairs. Tippins\r\nall abroad about the legs, and seeking to express that those unsteady\r\narticles are only skipping in their native buoyancy.\r\n\r\nAnd dear Mrs Lammle and dear Mr Lammle, how do you do, and when are\r\nyou going down to what\xe2\x80\x99s-its-name place--Guy, Earl of Warwick, you\r\nknow--what is it?--Dun Cow--to claim the flitch of bacon? And Mortimer,\r\nwhose name is for ever blotted out from my list of lovers, by reason\r\nfirst of fickleness and then of base desertion, how do YOU do, wretch?\r\nAnd Mr Wrayburn, YOU here! What can YOU come for, because we are all\r\nvery sure before-hand that you are not going to talk! And Veneering,\r\nM.P., how are things going on down at the house, and when will you turn\r\nout those terrible people for us? And Mrs Veneering, my dear, can it\r\npositively be true that you go down to that stifling place night after\r\nnight, to hear those men prose? Talking of which, Veneering, why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou prose, for you haven\xe2\x80\x99t opened your lips there yet, and we are dying\r\nto hear what you have got to say to us! Miss Podsnap, charmed to see\r\nyou. Pa, here? No! Ma, neither? Oh! Mr Boots! Delighted. Mr Brewer!\r\nThis IS a gathering of the clans. Thus Tippins, and surveys Fledgeby and\r\noutsiders through golden glass, murmuring as she turns about and about,\r\nin her innocent giddy way, Anybody else I know? No, I think not. Nobody\r\nthere. Nobody THERE. Nobody anywhere!\r\n\r\nMr Lammle, all a-glitter, produces his friend Fledgeby, as dying for the\r\nhonour of presentation to Lady Tippins. Fledgeby presented, has the air\r\nof going to say something, has the air of going to say nothing, has an\r\nair successively of meditation, of resignation, and of desolation,\r\nbacks on Brewer, makes the tour of Boots, and fades into the extreme\r\nbackground, feeling for his whisker, as if it might have turned up since\r\nhe was there five minutes ago.\r\n\r\nBut Lammle has him out again before he has so much as completely\r\nascertained the bareness of the land. He would seem to be in a bad way,\r\nFledgeby; for Lammle represents him as dying again. He is dying now, of\r\nwant of presentation to Twemlow.\r\n\r\nTwemlow offers his hand. Glad to see him. \xe2\x80\x98Your mother, sir, was a\r\nconnexion of mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe so,\xe2\x80\x99 says Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98but my mother and her family were two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you staying in town?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Twemlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always am,\xe2\x80\x99 says Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You like town,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow. But is felled flat by Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s taking\r\nit quite ill, and replying, No, he don\xe2\x80\x99t like town. Lammle tries to\r\nbreak the force of the fall, by remarking that some people do not like\r\ntown. Fledgeby retorting that he never heard of any such case but his\r\nown, Twemlow goes down again heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is nothing new this morning, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, returning\r\nto the mark with great spirit.\r\n\r\nFledgeby has not heard of anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a word of news,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a particle,\xe2\x80\x99 adds Boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not an atom,\xe2\x80\x99 chimes in Brewer.\r\n\r\nSomehow the execution of this little concerted piece appears to raise\r\nthe general spirits as with a sense of duty done, and sets the company a\r\ngoing. Everybody seems more equal than before, to the calamity of being\r\nin the society of everybody else. Even Eugene standing in a window,\r\nmoodily swinging the tassel of a blind, gives it a smarter jerk now, as\r\nif he found himself in better case.\r\n\r\nBreakfast announced. Everything on table showy and gaudy, but with\r\na self-assertingly temporary and nomadic air on the decorations, as\r\nboasting that they will be much more showy and gaudy in the palatial\r\nresidence. Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s own particular servant behind his chair; the\r\nAnalytical behind Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s chair; instances in point that\r\nsuch servants fall into two classes: one mistrusting the master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintances, and the other mistrusting the master. Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservant, of the second class. Appearing to be lost in wonder and low\r\nspirits because the police are so long in coming to take his master up\r\non some charge of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nVeneering, M.P., on the right of Mrs Lammle; Twemlow on her left; Mrs\r\nVeneering, W.M.P. (wife of Member of Parliament), and Lady Tippins on Mr\r\nLammle\xe2\x80\x99s right and left. But be sure that well within the fascination of\r\nMr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s eye and smile sits little Georgiana. And be sure that\r\nclose to little Georgiana, also under inspection by the same gingerous\r\ngentleman, sits Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nOftener than twice or thrice while breakfast is in progress, Mr Twemlow\r\ngives a little sudden turn towards Mrs Lammle, and then says to her, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nbeg your pardon!\xe2\x80\x99 This not being Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s usual way, why is it his\r\nway to-day? Why, the truth is, Twemlow repeatedly labours under the\r\nimpression that Mrs Lammle is going to speak to him, and turning finds\r\nthat it is not so, and mostly that she has her eyes upon Veneering.\r\nStrange that this impression so abides by Twemlow after being corrected,\r\nyet so it is.\r\n\r\nLady Tippins partaking plentifully of the fruits of the earth (including\r\ngrape-juice in the category) becomes livelier, and applies herself to\r\nelicit sparks from Mortimer Lightwood. It is always understood among the\r\ninitiated, that that faithless lover must be planted at table opposite\r\nto Lady Tippins, who will then strike conversational fire out of him.\r\nIn a pause of mastication and deglutition, Lady Tippins, contemplating\r\nMortimer, recalls that it was at our dear Veneerings, and in the\r\npresence of a party who are surely all here, that he told them his\r\nstory of the man from somewhere, which afterwards became so horribly\r\ninteresting and vulgarly popular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Lady Tippins,\xe2\x80\x99 assents Mortimer; \xe2\x80\x98as they say on the stage, \xe2\x80\x9cEven\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then we expect you,\xe2\x80\x99 retorts the charmer, \xe2\x80\x98to sustain your reputation,\r\nand tell us something else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lady Tippins, I exhausted myself for life that day, and there is\r\nnothing more to be got out of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer parries thus, with a sense upon him that elsewhere it is Eugene\r\nand not he who is the jester, and that in these circles where Eugene\r\npersists in being speechless, he, Mortimer, is but the double of the\r\nfriend on whom he has founded himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth the fascinating Tippins, \xe2\x80\x98I am resolved on getting\r\nsomething more out of you. Traitor! what is this I hear about another\r\ndisappearance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As it is you who have heard it,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Monster, away!\xe2\x80\x99 retorts Lady Tippins. \xe2\x80\x98Your own Golden Dustman referred\r\nme to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle, striking in here, proclaims aloud that there is a sequel\r\nto the story of the man from somewhere. Silence ensues upon the\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lightwood, glancing round the table, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nnothing to tell.\xe2\x80\x99 But Eugene adding in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98There, tell\r\nit, tell it!\xe2\x80\x99 he corrects himself with the addition, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing worth\r\nmentioning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoots and Brewer immediately perceive that it is immensely worth\r\nmentioning, and become politely clamorous. Veneering is also visited by\r\na perception to the same effect. But it is understood that his attention\r\nis now rather used up, and difficult to hold, that being the tone of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t be at the trouble of composing yourselves to listen,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nMortimer Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98because I shall have finished long before you have\r\nfallen into comfortable attitudes. It\xe2\x80\x99s like--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s like,\xe2\x80\x99 impatiently interrupts Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98the children\xe2\x80\x99s narrative:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a story\r\n     Of Jack a Manory,\r\n     And now my story\xe2\x80\x99s begun;\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you another\r\n     Of Jack and his brother,\r\n     And now my story is done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n--Get on, and get it over!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene says this with a sound of vexation in his voice, leaning back in\r\nhis chair and looking balefully at Lady Tippins, who nods to him as\r\nher dear Bear, and playfully insinuates that she (a self-evident\r\nproposition) is Beauty, and he Beast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The reference,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeds Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98which I suppose to be made by my\r\nhonourable and fair enslaver opposite, is to the following circumstance.\r\nVery lately, the young woman, Lizzie Hexam, daughter of the late Jesse\r\nHexam, otherwise Gaffer, who will be remembered to have found the body\r\nof the man from somewhere, mysteriously received, she knew not from\r\nwhom, an explicit retraction of the charges made against her father, by\r\nanother water-side character of the name of Riderhood. Nobody believed\r\nthem, because little Rogue Riderhood--I am tempted into the paraphrase\r\nby remembering the charming wolf who would have rendered society a great\r\nservice if he had devoured Mr Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother in their\r\ninfancy--had previously played fast and loose with the said charges,\r\nand, in fact, abandoned them. However, the retraction I have mentioned\r\nfound its way into Lizzie Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s hands, with a general flavour on it\r\nof having been favoured by some anonymous messenger in a dark cloak and\r\nslouched hat, and was by her forwarded, in her father\xe2\x80\x99s vindication, to\r\nMr Boffin, my client. You will excuse the phraseology of the shop, but\r\nas I never had another client, and in all likelihood never shall have, I\r\nam rather proud of him as a natural curiosity probably unique.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlthough as easy as usual on the surface, Lightwood is not quite as easy\r\nas usual below it. With an air of not minding Eugene at all, he feels\r\nthat the subject is not altogether a safe one in that connexion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The natural curiosity which forms the sole ornament of my professional\r\nmuseum,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumes, \xe2\x80\x98hereupon desires his Secretary--an individual\r\nof the hermit-crab or oyster species, and whose name, I think, is\r\nChokesmith--but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least matter--say Artichoke--to put\r\nhimself in communication with Lizzie Hexam. Artichoke professes his\r\nreadiness so to do, endeavours to do so, but fails.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why fails?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How fails?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Brewer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98I must postpone the reply for one\r\nmoment, or we shall have an anti-climax. Artichoke failing signally, my\r\nclient refers the task to me: his purpose being to advance the interests\r\nof the object of his search. I proceed to put myself in communication\r\nwith her; I even happen to possess some special means,\xe2\x80\x99 with a glance\r\nat Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98of putting myself in communication with her; but I fail too,\r\nbecause she has vanished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Vanished!\xe2\x80\x99 is the general echo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Disappeared,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mortimer. \xe2\x80\x98Nobody knows how, nobody knows when,\r\nnobody knows where. And so ends the story to which my honourable and\r\nfair enslaver opposite referred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTippins, with a bewitching little scream, opines that we shall every one\r\nof us be murdered in our beds. Eugene eyes her as if some of us would\r\nbe enough for him. Mrs Veneering, W.M.P., remarks that these social\r\nmysteries make one afraid of leaving Baby. Veneering, M.P., wishes to\r\nbe informed (with something of a second-hand air of seeing the Right\r\nHonourable Gentleman at the head of the Home Department in his place)\r\nwhether it is intended to be conveyed that the vanished person has been\r\nspirited away or otherwise harmed? Instead of Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s answering,\r\nEugene answers, and answers hastily and vexedly: \xe2\x80\x98No, no, no; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean that; he means voluntarily vanished--but utterly--completely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, the great subject of the happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle must\r\nnot be allowed to vanish with the other vanishments--with the vanishing\r\nof the murderer, the vanishing of Julius Handford, the vanishing of\r\nLizzie Hexam,--and therefore Veneering must recall the present sheep\r\nto the pen from which they have strayed. Who so fit to discourse of\r\nthe happiness of Mr and Mrs Lammle, they being the dearest and oldest\r\nfriends he has in the world; or what audience so fit for him to take\r\ninto his confidence as that audience, a noun of multitude or signifying\r\nmany, who are all the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world?\r\nSo Veneering, without the formality of rising, launches into a familiar\r\noration, gradually toning into the Parliamentary sing-song, in which he\r\nsees at that board his dear friend Twemlow who on that day twelvemonth\r\nbestowed on his dear friend Lammle the fair hand of his dear friend\r\nSophronia, and in which he also sees at that board his dear friends\r\nBoots and Brewer whose rallying round him at a period when his dear\r\nfriend Lady Tippins likewise rallied round him--ay, and in the foremost\r\nrank--he can never forget while memory holds her seat. But he is free\r\nto confess that he misses from that board his dear old friend Podsnap,\r\nthough he is well represented by his dear young friend Georgiana. And he\r\nfurther sees at that board (this he announces with pomp, as if exulting\r\nin the powers of an extraordinary telescope) his friend Mr Fledgeby, if\r\nhe will permit him to call him so. For all of these reasons, and many\r\nmore which he right well knows will have occurred to persons of your\r\nexceptional acuteness, he is here to submit to you that the time has\r\narrived when, with our hearts in our glasses, with tears in our eyes,\r\nwith blessings on our lips, and in a general way with a profusion of\r\ngammon and spinach in our emotional larders, we should one and all drink\r\nto our dear friends the Lammles, wishing them many years as happy as\r\nthe last, and many many friends as congenially united as themselves. And\r\nthis he will add; that Anastatia Veneering (who is instantly heard to\r\nweep) is formed on the same model as her old and chosen friend Sophronia\r\nLammle, in respect that she is devoted to the man who wooed and won her,\r\nand nobly discharges the duties of a wife.\r\n\r\nSeeing no better way out of it, Veneering here pulls up his oratorical\r\nPegasus extremely short, and plumps down, clean over his head, with:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lammle, God bless you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Lammle. Too much of him every way; pervadingly too much nose of a\r\ncoarse wrong shape, and his nose in his mind and his manners; too much\r\nsmile to be real; too much frown to be false; too many large teeth to be\r\nvisible at once without suggesting a bite. He thanks you, dear friends,\r\nfor your kindly greeting, and hopes to receive you--it may be on the\r\nnext of these delightful occasions--in a residence better suited to\r\nyour claims on the rites of hospitality. He will never forget that at\r\nVeneering\xe2\x80\x99s he first saw Sophronia. Sophronia will never forget that at\r\nVeneering\xe2\x80\x99s she first saw him. \xe2\x80\x98They spoke of it soon after they\r\nwere married, and agreed that they would never forget it. In fact, to\r\nVeneering they owe their union. They hope to show their sense of this\r\nsome day [\xe2\x80\x98No, no, from Veneering)--oh yes, yes, and let him rely\r\nupon it, they will if they can! His marriage with Sophronia was not a\r\nmarriage of interest on either side: she had her little fortune, he had\r\nhis little fortune: they joined their little fortunes: it was a marriage\r\nof pure inclination and suitability. Thank you! Sophronia and he are\r\nfond of the society of young people; but he is not sure that their house\r\nwould be a good house for young people proposing to remain single, since\r\nthe contemplation of its domestic bliss might induce them to change\r\ntheir minds. He will not apply this to any one present; certainly not\r\nto their darling little Georgiana. Again thank you! Neither, by-the-by,\r\nwill he apply it to his friend Fledgeby. He thanks Veneering for the\r\nfeeling manner in which he referred to their common friend Fledgeby, for\r\nhe holds that gentleman in the highest estimation. Thank you. In fact\r\n(returning unexpectedly to Fledgeby), the better you know him, the more\r\nyou find in him that you desire to know. Again thank you! In his dear\r\nSophronia\xe2\x80\x99s name and in his own, thank you!\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle has sat quite still, with her eyes cast down upon the\r\ntable-cloth. As Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s address ends, Twemlow once more turns to her\r\ninvoluntarily, not cured yet of that often recurring impression that she\r\nis going to speak to him. This time she really is going to speak to him.\r\nVeneering is talking with his other next neighbour, and she speaks in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Twemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe answers, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon? Yes?\xe2\x80\x99 Still a little doubtful, because\r\nof her not looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have the soul of a gentleman, and I know I may trust you. Will you\r\ngive me the opportunity of saying a few words to you when you come up\r\nstairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Assuredly. I shall be honoured.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to do so, if you please, and don\xe2\x80\x99t think it inconsistent if\r\nmy manner should be more careless than my words. I may be watched.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIntensely astonished, Twemlow puts his hand to his forehead, and sinks\r\nback in his chair meditating. Mrs Lammle rises. All rise. The ladies go\r\nup stairs. The gentlemen soon saunter after them. Fledgeby has devoted\r\nthe interval to taking an observation of Boots\xe2\x80\x99s whiskers, Brewer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhiskers, and Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s whiskers, and considering which pattern of\r\nwhisker he would prefer to produce out of himself by friction, if the\r\nGenie of the cheek would only answer to his rubbing.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room, groups form as usual. Lightwood, Boots, and Brewer,\r\nflutter like moths around that yellow wax candle--guttering down,\r\nand with some hint of a winding-sheet in it--Lady Tippins. Outsiders\r\ncultivate Veneering, M P., and Mrs Veneering, W.M.P. Lammle stands with\r\nfolded arms, Mephistophelean in a corner, with Georgiana and Fledgeby.\r\nMrs Lammle, on a sofa by a table, invites Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s attention to a\r\nbook of portraits in her hand.\r\n\r\nMr Twemlow takes his station on a settee before her, and Mrs Lammle\r\nshows him a portrait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have reason to be surprised,\xe2\x80\x99 she says softly, \xe2\x80\x98but I wish you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDisturbed Twemlow, making an effort not to look so, looks much more so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, Mr Twemlow, you never saw that distant connexion of yours\r\nbefore to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now that you do see him, you see what he is. You are not proud of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To say the truth, Mrs Lammle, no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you knew more of him, you would be less inclined to acknowledge him.\r\nHere is another portrait. What do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow has just presence of mind enough to say aloud: \xe2\x80\x98Very like!\r\nUncommonly like!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have noticed, perhaps, whom he favours with his attentions? You\r\nnotice where he is now, and how engaged?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. But Mr Lammle--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe darts a look at him which he cannot comprehend, and shows him\r\nanother portrait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good; is it not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charming!\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So like as to be almost a caricature?--Mr Twemlow, it is impossible\r\nto tell you what the struggle in my mind has been, before I could bring\r\nmyself to speak to you as I do now. It is only in the conviction that I\r\nmay trust you never to betray me, that I can proceed. Sincerely promise\r\nme that you never will betray my confidence--that you will respect it,\r\neven though you may no longer respect me,--and I shall be as satisfied\r\nas if you had sworn it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Madam, on the honour of a poor gentleman--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. I can desire no more. Mr Twemlow, I implore you to save that\r\nchild!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Georgiana. She will be sacrificed. She will be inveigled and married\r\nto that connexion of yours. It is a partnership affair, a\r\nmoney-speculation. She has no strength of will or character to help\r\nherself and she is on the brink of being sold into wretchedness for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amazing! But what can I do to prevent it?\xe2\x80\x99 demands Twemlow, shocked and\r\nbewildered to the last degree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is another portrait. And not good, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAghast at the light manner of her throwing her head back to look at it\r\ncritically, Twemlow still dimly perceives the expediency of throwing his\r\nown head back, and does so. Though he no more sees the portrait than if\r\nit were in China.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Decidedly not good,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98Stiff and exaggerated!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And ex--\xe2\x80\x99 But Twemlow, in his demolished state, cannot command the\r\nword, and trails off into \xe2\x80\x98--actly so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Twemlow, your word will have weight with her pompous, self-blinded\r\nfather. You know how much he makes of your family. Lose no time. Warn\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But warn him against whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Against me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy great good fortune Twemlow receives a stimulant at this critical\r\ninstant. The stimulant is Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, my dear, what portraits are you showing Twemlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Public characters, Alfred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show him the last of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Alfred.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe puts the book down, takes another book up, turns the leaves, and\r\npresents the portrait to Twemlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the last of Mr Lammle. Do you think it good?--Warn her father\r\nagainst me. I deserve it, for I have been in the scheme from the first.\r\nIt is my husband\xe2\x80\x99s scheme, your connexion\xe2\x80\x99s, and mine. I tell you this,\r\nonly to show you the necessity of the poor little foolish affectionate\r\ncreature\xe2\x80\x99s being befriended and rescued. You will not repeat this to her\r\nfather. You will spare me so far, and spare my husband. For, though this\r\ncelebration of to-day is all a mockery, he is my husband, and we must\r\nlive.--Do you think it like?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow, in a stunned condition, feigns to compare the portrait in his\r\nhand with the original looking towards him from his Mephistophelean\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 are at length the words which Twemlow with great\r\ndifficulty extracts from himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you think so. On the whole, I myself consider it the best.\r\nThe others are so dark. Now here, for instance, is another of Mr\r\nLammle--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand; I don\xe2\x80\x99t see my way,\xe2\x80\x99 Twemlow stammers, as he\r\nfalters over the book with his glass at his eye. \xe2\x80\x98How warn her father,\r\nand not tell him? Tell him how much? Tell him how little? I--I--am\r\ngetting lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him I am a match-maker; tell him I am an artful and designing\r\nwoman; tell him you are sure his daughter is best out of my house and my\r\ncompany. Tell him any such things of me; they will all be true. You know\r\nwhat a puffed-up man he is, and how easily you can cause his vanity to\r\ntake the alarm. Tell him as much as will give him the alarm and make\r\nhim careful of her, and spare me the rest. Mr Twemlow, I feel my sudden\r\ndegradation in your eyes; familiar as I am with my degradation in my own\r\neyes, I keenly feel the change that must have come upon me in yours,\r\nin these last few moments. But I trust to your good faith with me as\r\nimplicitly as when I began. If you knew how often I have tried to speak\r\nto you to-day, you would almost pity me. I want no new promise from you\r\non my own account, for I am satisfied, and I always shall be satisfied,\r\nwith the promise you have given me. I can venture to say no more, for\r\nI see that I am watched. If you would set my mind at rest with the\r\nassurance that you will interpose with the father and save this harmless\r\ngirl, close that book before you return it to me, and I shall know what\r\nyou mean, and deeply thank you in my heart.--Alfred, Mr Twemlow thinks\r\nthe last one the best, and quite agrees with you and me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAlfred advances. The groups break up. Lady Tippins rises to go, and Mrs\r\nVeneering follows her leader. For the moment, Mrs Lammle does not turn\r\nto them, but remains looking at Twemlow looking at Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s portrait\r\nthrough his eyeglass. The moment past, Twemlow drops his eyeglass at its\r\nribbon\xe2\x80\x99s length, rises, and closes the book with an emphasis which makes\r\nthat fragile nursling of the fairies, Tippins, start.\r\n\r\nThen good-bye and good-bye, and charming occasion worthy of the Golden\r\nAge, and more about the flitch of bacon, and the like of that; and\r\nTwemlow goes staggering across Piccadilly with his hand to his forehead,\r\nand is nearly run down by a flushed lettercart, and at last drops\r\nsafe in his easy-chair, innocent good gentleman, with his hand to his\r\nforehead still, and his head in a whirl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE THIRD -- A LONG LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nLODGERS IN QUEER STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a foggy day in London, and the fog was heavy and dark. Animate\r\nLondon, with smarting eyes and irritated lungs, was blinking, wheezing,\r\nand choking; inanimate London was a sooty spectre, divided in purpose\r\nbetween being visible and invisible, and so being wholly neither.\r\nGaslights flared in the shops with a haggard and unblest air, as knowing\r\nthemselves to be night-creatures that had no business abroad under the\r\nsun; while the sun itself when it was for a few moments dimly indicated\r\nthrough circling eddies of fog, showed as if it had gone out and were\r\ncollapsing flat and cold. Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy\r\nday, but there the fog was grey, whereas in London it was, at about\r\nthe boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then\r\nbrowner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City--which call\r\nSaint Mary Axe--it was rusty-black. From any point of the high ridge of\r\nland northward, it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings\r\nmade an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea, and\r\nespecially that the great dome of Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to die hard; but\r\nthis was not perceivable in the streets at their feet, where the whole\r\nmetropolis was a heap of vapour charged with muffled sound of wheels,\r\nand enfolding a gigantic catarrh.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock on such a morning, the place of business of Pubsey and\r\nCo. was not the liveliest object even in Saint Mary Axe--which is not a\r\nvery lively spot--with a sobbing gaslight in the counting-house window,\r\nand a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the\r\nkeyhole of the main door. But the light went out, and the main door\r\nopened, and Riah came forth with a bag under his arm.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the act of coming out at the door, Riah went into the fog, and\r\nwas lost to the eyes of Saint Mary Axe. But the eyes of this history\r\ncan follow him westward, by Cornhill, Cheapside, Fleet Street, and the\r\nStrand, to Piccadilly and the Albany. Thither he went at his grave and\r\nmeasured pace, staff in hand, skirt at heel; and more than one head,\r\nturning to look back at his venerable figure already lost in the mist,\r\nsupposed it to be some ordinary figure indistinctly seen, which fancy\r\nand the fog had worked into that passing likeness.\r\n\r\nArrived at the house in which his master\xe2\x80\x99s chambers were on the\r\nsecond floor, Riah proceeded up the stairs, and paused at Fascination\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s door. Making free with neither bell nor knocker, he struck\r\nupon the door with the top of his staff, and, having listened, sat down\r\non the threshold. It was characteristic of his habitual submission,\r\nthat he sat down on the raw dark staircase, as many of his ancestors\r\nhad probably sat down in dungeons, taking what befell him as it might\r\nbefall.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, when he had grown so cold as to be fain to blow upon his\r\nfingers, he arose and knocked with his staff again, and listened again,\r\nand again sat down to wait. Thrice he repeated these actions before his\r\nlistening ears were greeted by the voice of Fledgeby, calling from his\r\nbed, \xe2\x80\x98Hold your row!--I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and open the door directly!\xe2\x80\x99 But, in\r\nlieu of coming directly, he fell into a sweet sleep for some quarter of\r\nan hour more, during which added interval Riah sat upon the stairs and\r\nwaited with perfect patience.\r\n\r\nAt length the door stood open, and Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s retreating drapery\r\nplunged into bed again. Following it at a respectful distance, Riah\r\npassed into the bed-chamber, where a fire had been sometime lighted, and\r\nwas burning briskly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what time of night do you mean to call it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Fledgeby,\r\nturning away beneath the clothes, and presenting a comfortable rampart\r\nof shoulder to the chilled figure of the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, it is full half-past ten in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The deuce it is! Then it must be precious foggy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very foggy, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And raw, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Chill and bitter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riah, drawing out a handkerchief, and wiping\r\nthe moisture from his beard and long grey hair as he stood on the verge\r\nof the rug, with his eyes on the acceptable fire.\r\n\r\nWith a plunge of enjoyment, Fledgeby settled himself afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any snow, or sleet, or slush, or anything of that sort?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, no. Not quite so bad as that. The streets are pretty clean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t brag about it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby, disappointed in his\r\ndesire to heighten the contrast between his bed and the streets. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re always bragging about something. Got the books there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are here, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn the general subject over in my mind for a minute\r\nor two, and while I\xe2\x80\x99m about it you can empty your bag and get ready for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith another comfortable plunge, Mr Fledgeby fell asleep again. The old\r\nman, having obeyed his directions, sat down on the edge of a chair, and,\r\nfolding his hands before him, gradually yielded to the influence of the\r\nwarmth, and dozed. He was roused by Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s appearing erect at\r\nthe foot of the bed, in Turkish slippers, rose-coloured Turkish trousers\r\n(got cheap from somebody who had cheated some other somebody out of\r\nthem), and a gown and cap to correspond. In that costume he would have\r\nleft nothing to be desired, if he had been further fitted out with a\r\nbottomless chair, a lantern, and a bunch of matches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, old \xe2\x80\x98un!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fascination, in his light raillery, \xe2\x80\x98what dodgery\r\nare you up to next, sitting there with your eyes shut? You ain\xe2\x80\x99t asleep.\r\nCatch a weasel at it, and catch a Jew!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, sir, I fear I nodded,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not you!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby, with a cunning look. \xe2\x80\x98A telling move with\r\na good many, I dare say, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t put ME off my guard. Not a bad\r\nnotion though, if you want to look indifferent in driving a bargain. Oh,\r\nyou are a dodger!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head, gently repudiating the imputation, and\r\nsuppressed a sigh, and moved to the table at which Mr Fledgeby was now\r\npouring out for himself a cup of steaming and fragrant coffee from a pot\r\nthat had stood ready on the hob. It was an edifying spectacle, the young\r\nman in his easy chair taking his coffee, and the old man with his grey\r\nhead bent, standing awaiting his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Fork out your balance in hand, and prove by\r\nfigures how you make it out that it ain\xe2\x80\x99t more. First of all, light that\r\ncandle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiah obeyed, and then taking a bag from his breast, and referring to\r\nthe sum in the accounts for which they made him responsible, told it out\r\nupon the table. Fledgeby told it again with great care, and rang every\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, taking one up to eye it closely, \xe2\x80\x98you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nlightening any of these; but it\xe2\x80\x99s a trade of your people\xe2\x80\x99s, you know.\r\nYOU understand what sweating a pound means, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much as you do, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the old man, with his hands under\r\nopposite cuffs of his loose sleeves, as he stood at the table,\r\ndeferentially observant of the master\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x98May I take the liberty to\r\nsay something?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may,\xe2\x80\x99 Fledgeby graciously conceded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you not, sir--without intending it--of a surety without intending\r\nit--sometimes mingle the character I fairly earn in your employment,\r\nwith the character which it is your policy that I should bear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t find it worth my while to cut things so fine as to go into the\r\ninquiry,\xe2\x80\x99 Fascination coolly answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in justice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bother justice!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in generosity?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jews and generosity!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a good connexion! Bring\r\nout your vouchers, and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk Jerusalem palaver.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe vouchers were produced, and for the next half-hour Mr Fledgeby\r\nconcentrated his sublime attention on them. They and the accounts were\r\nall found correct, and the books and the papers resumed their places in\r\nthe bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98concerning that bill-broking branch of the\r\nbusiness; the branch I like best. What queer bills are to be bought, and\r\nat what prices? You have got your list of what\xe2\x80\x99s in the market?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, a long list,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Riah, taking out a pocket-book, and\r\nselecting from its contents a folded paper, which, being unfolded,\r\nbecame a sheet of foolscap covered with close writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whew!\xe2\x80\x99 whistled Fledgeby, as he took it in his hand. \xe2\x80\x98Queer Street is\r\nfull of lodgers just at present! These are to be disposed of in parcels;\r\nare they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In parcels as set forth,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the old man, looking over his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder; \xe2\x80\x98or the lump.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half the lump will be waste-paper, one knows beforehand,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nFledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Can you get it at waste-paper price? That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiah shook his head, and Fledgeby cast his small eyes down the list.\r\nThey presently began to twinkle, and he no sooner became conscious of\r\ntheir twinkling, than he looked up over his shoulder at the grave face\r\nabove him, and moved to the chimney-piece. Making a desk of it, he stood\r\nthere with his back to the old man, warming his knees, perusing the list\r\nat his leisure, and often returning to some lines of it, as though\r\nthey were particularly interesting. At those times he glanced in the\r\nchimney-glass to see what note the old man took of him. He took none\r\nthat could be detected, but, aware of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions, stood\r\nwith his eyes on the ground.\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby was thus amiably engaged when a step was heard at the outer\r\ndoor, and the door was heard to open hastily. \xe2\x80\x98Hark! That\xe2\x80\x99s your doing,\r\nyou Pump of Israel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby; \xe2\x80\x98you can\xe2\x80\x99t have shut it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the\r\nstep was heard within, and the voice of Mr Alfred Lammle called aloud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you anywhere here, Fledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99 To which Fledgeby, after cautioning\r\nRiah in a low voice to take his cue as it should be given him, replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here I am!\xe2\x80\x99 and opened his bedroom door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98This gentleman is only Pubsey and Co. of\r\nSaint Mary Axe, that I am trying to make terms for an unfortunate friend\r\nwith in a matter of some dishonoured bills. But really Pubsey and Co.\r\nare so strict with their debtors, and so hard to move, that I seem to be\r\nwasting my time. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I make ANY terms with you on my friend\xe2\x80\x99s part, Mr\r\nRiah?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am but the representative of another, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Jew in a low\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x98I do as I am bidden by my principal. It is not my capital that\r\nis invested in the business. It is not my profit that arises therefrom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha ha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Lammle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha ha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. Of course. We know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Devilish good, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it, Lammle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, unspeakably amused by\r\nhis hidden joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always the same, always the same!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98Mr--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Riah, Pubsey and Co. Saint Mary Axe,\xe2\x80\x99 Fledgeby put in, as he wiped away\r\nthe tears that trickled from his eyes, so rare was his enjoyment of his\r\nsecret joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Riah is bound to observe the invariable forms for such cases made\r\nand provided,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is only the representative of another!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Does as\r\nhe is told by his principal! Not his capital that\xe2\x80\x99s invested in the\r\nbusiness. Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s good! Ha ha ha ha!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Lammle joined in the laugh\r\nand looked knowing; and the more he did both, the more exquisite the\r\nsecret joke became for Mr Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 said that fascinating gentleman, wiping his eyes again, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nwe go on in this way, we shall seem to be almost making game of Mr Riah,\r\nor of Pubsey and Co. Saint Mary Axe, or of somebody: which is far from\r\nour intention. Mr Riah, if you would have the kindness to step into the\r\nnext room for a few moments while I speak with Mr Lammle here, I should\r\nlike to try to make terms with you once again before you go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man, who had never raised his eyes during the whole transaction\r\nof Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s joke, silently bowed and passed out by the door which\r\nFledgeby opened for him. Having closed it on him, Fledgeby returned to\r\nLammle, standing with his back to the bedroom fire, with one hand under\r\nhis coat-skirts, and all his whiskers in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you know it?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you show it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Fledgeby in unintentional rhyme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well then; there is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle; \xe2\x80\x98there IS something wrong; the whole\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Fascination very slowly, and sitting down with his\r\nhands on his knees to stare at his glowering friend with his back to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you, Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Lammle, with a sweep of his right arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the whole thing\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. The game\xe2\x80\x99s up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What game\xe2\x80\x99s up?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Fledgeby, as slowly as before, and more\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THE game. OUR game. Read that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFledgeby took a note from his extended hand and read it aloud. \xe2\x80\x98Alfred\r\nLammle, Esquire. Sir: Allow Mrs Podsnap and myself to express our united\r\nsense of the polite attentions of Mrs Alfred Lammle and yourself towards\r\nour daughter, Georgiana. Allow us also, wholly to reject them for the\r\nfuture, and to communicate our final desire that the two families\r\nmay become entire strangers. I have the honour to be, Sir, your most\r\nobedient and very humble servant, JOHN PODSNAP.\xe2\x80\x99 Fledgeby looked at the\r\nthree blank sides of this note, quite as long and earnestly as at the\r\nfirst expressive side, and then looked at Lammle, who responded with\r\nanother extensive sweep of his right arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose doing is this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible to imagine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Fledgeby, after reflecting with a very discontented\r\nbrow, \xe2\x80\x98somebody has been giving you a bad character.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle, with a deeper frown.\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby appeared to be on the verge of some mutinous expressions,\r\nwhen his hand happened to touch his nose. A certain remembrance\r\nconnected with that feature operating as a timely warning, he took it\r\nthoughtfully between his thumb and forefinger, and pondered; Lammle\r\nmeanwhile eyeing him with furtive eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98This won\xe2\x80\x99t improve with talking about. If we\r\never find out who did it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll mark that person. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more\r\nto be said, except that you undertook to do what circumstances prevent\r\nyour doing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that you undertook to do what you might have done by this time, if\r\nyou had made a prompter use of circumstances,\xe2\x80\x99 snarled Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah! That,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Fledgeby, with his hands in the Turkish trousers,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98is matter of opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle, in a bullying tone, \xe2\x80\x98am I to understand that\r\nyou in any way reflect upon me, or hint dissatisfaction with me, in this\r\naffair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby; \xe2\x80\x98provided you have brought my promissory note in\r\nyour pocket, and now hand it over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLammle produced it, not without reluctance. Fledgeby looked at it,\r\nidentified it, twisted it up, and threw it into the fire. They both\r\nlooked at it as it blazed, went out, and flew in feathery ash up the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98NOW, Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle, as before; \xe2\x80\x98am I to understand that\r\nyou in any way reflect upon me, or hint dissatisfaction with me, in this\r\naffair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Finally and unreservedly no?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fledgeby, my hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby took it, saying, \xe2\x80\x98And if we ever find out who did this,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll mark that person. And in the most friendly manner, let me mention\r\none thing more. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your circumstances are, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask. You have sustained a loss here. Many men are liable to be involved\r\nat times, and you may be, or you may not be. But whatever you do,\r\nLammle, don\xe2\x80\x99t--don\xe2\x80\x99t--don\xe2\x80\x99t, I beg of you--ever fall into the hands of\r\nPubsey and Co. in the next room, for they are grinders. Regular flayers\r\nand grinders, my dear Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Fledgeby with a peculiar relish,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and they\xe2\x80\x99ll skin you by the inch, from the nape of your neck to the\r\nsole of your foot, and grind every inch of your skin to tooth-powder.\r\nYou have seen what Mr Riah is. Never fall into his hands, Lammle, I beg\r\nof you as a friend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle, disclosing some alarm at the solemnity of this affectionate\r\nadjuration, demanded why the devil he ever should fall into the hands of\r\nPubsey and Co.?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To confess the fact, I was made a little uneasy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the candid\r\nFledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98by the manner in which that Jew looked at you when he heard\r\nyour name. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like his eye. But it may have been the heated\r\nfancy of a friend. Of course if you are sure that you have no personal\r\nsecurity out, which you may not be quite equal to meeting, and which can\r\nhave got into his hands, it must have been fancy. Still, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nhis eye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe brooding Lammle, with certain white dints coming and going in his\r\npalpitating nose, looked as if some tormenting imp were pinching it.\r\nFledgeby, watching him with a twitch in his mean face which did duty\r\nthere for a smile, looked very like the tormentor who was pinching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t keep him waiting too long,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98or he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrevenge it on my unfortunate friend. How\xe2\x80\x99s your very clever and\r\nagreeable wife? She knows we have broken down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I showed her the letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very much surprised?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she would have been more so,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98if there had\r\nbeen more go in YOU?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!--She lays it upon me, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Fledgeby, I will not have my words misconstrued.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t break out, Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Fledgeby, in a submissive tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because there\xe2\x80\x99s no occasion. I only asked a question. Then she don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlay it upon me? To ask another question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, plainly seeing that she did. \xe2\x80\x98My compliments\r\nto her. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and Lammle strode out pondering. Fledgeby saw him\r\ninto the fog, and, returning to the fire and musing with his face to it,\r\nstretched the legs of the rose-coloured Turkish trousers wide apart, and\r\nmeditatively bent his knees, as if he were going down upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have a pair of whiskers, Lammle, which I never liked,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured\r\nFledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98and which money can\xe2\x80\x99t produce; you are boastful of your\r\nmanners and your conversation; you wanted to pull my nose, and you have\r\nlet me in for a failure, and your wife says I am the cause of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbowl you down. I will, though I have no whiskers,\xe2\x80\x99 here he rubbed the\r\nplaces where they were due, \xe2\x80\x98and no manners, and no conversation!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving thus relieved his noble mind, he collected the legs of the\r\nTurkish trousers, straightened himself on his knees, and called out\r\nto Riah in the next room, \xe2\x80\x98Halloa, you sir!\xe2\x80\x99 At sight of the old man\r\nre-entering with a gentleness monstrously in contrast with the character\r\nhe had given him, Mr Fledgeby was so tickled again, that he exclaimed,\r\nlaughing, \xe2\x80\x98Good! Good! Upon my soul it is uncommon good!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, old \xe2\x80\x98un,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Fledgeby, when he had had his laugh out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll buy up these lots that I mark with my pencil--there\xe2\x80\x99s a tick\r\nthere, and a tick there, and a tick there--and I wager two-pence you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nafterwards go on squeezing those Christians like the Jew you are. Now,\r\nnext you\xe2\x80\x99ll want a cheque--or you\xe2\x80\x99ll say you want it, though you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncapital enough somewhere, if one only knew where, but you\xe2\x80\x99d be peppered\r\nand salted and grilled on a gridiron before you\xe2\x80\x99d own to it--and that\r\ncheque I\xe2\x80\x99ll write.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he had unlocked a drawer and taken a key from it to open another\r\ndrawer, in which was another key that opened another drawer, in which\r\nwas another key that opened another drawer, in which was the cheque\r\nbook; and when he had written the cheque; and when, reversing the key\r\nand drawer process, he had placed his cheque book in safety again; he\r\nbeckoned the old man, with the folded cheque, to come and take it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old \xe2\x80\x98un,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, when the Jew had put it in his pocketbook, and\r\nwas putting that in the breast of his outer garment; \xe2\x80\x98so much at present\r\nfor my affairs. Now a word about affairs that are not exactly mine.\r\nWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith his hand not yet withdrawn from the breast of his garment, Riah\r\nstarted and paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oho!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it! Where have you hidden her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShowing that he was taken by surprise, the old man looked at his master\r\nwith some passing confusion, which the master highly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she in the house I pay rent and taxes for in Saint Mary Axe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndemanded Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she in your garden up atop of that house--gone up to be dead, or\r\nwhatever the game is?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is she then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiah bent his eyes upon the ground, as if considering whether he could\r\nanswer the question without breach of faith, and then silently raised\r\nthem to Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s face, as if he could not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t press that just now. But I want to know\r\nthis, and I will know this, mind you. What are you up to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man, with an apologetic action of his head and hands, as not\r\ncomprehending the master\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, addressed to him a look of mute\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t be a gallivanting dodger,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98For you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cregular pity the sorrows\xe2\x80\x9d, you know--if you DO know any Christian\r\nrhyme--\xe2\x80\x9cwhose trembling limbs have borne him to\xe2\x80\x9d--et cetrer. You\xe2\x80\x99re one\r\nof the Patriarchs; you\xe2\x80\x99re a shaky old card; and you can\xe2\x80\x99t be in love\r\nwith this Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 expostulated Riah. \xe2\x80\x98O, sir, sir, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Fledgeby, with some slight tinge of a blush, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou out with your reason for having your spoon in the soup at all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I will tell you the truth. But (your pardon for the stipulation)\r\nit is in sacred confidence; it is strictly upon honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Honour too!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby, with a mocking lip. \xe2\x80\x98Honour among Jews.\r\nWell. Cut away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is upon honour, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 the other still stipulated, with respectful\r\nfirmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, certainly. Honour bright,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nThe old man, never bidden to sit down, stood with an earnest hand laid\r\non the back of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s easy chair. The young man sat looking at\r\nthe fire with a face of listening curiosity, ready to check him off and\r\ncatch him tripping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cut away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Start with your motive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I have no motive but to help the helpless.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby could only express the feelings to which this incredible\r\nstatement gave rise in his breast, by a prodigiously long derisive\r\nsniff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I came to know, and much to esteem and to respect, this damsel, I\r\nmentioned when you saw her in my poor garden on the house-top,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nJew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, distrustfully. \xe2\x80\x98Well. Perhaps you did,\r\nthough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The better I knew her, the more interest I felt in her fortunes. They\r\ngathered to a crisis. I found her beset by a selfish and ungrateful\r\nbrother, beset by an unacceptable wooer, beset by the snares of a more\r\npowerful lover, beset by the wiles of her own heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She took to one of the chaps then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, it was only natural that she should incline towards him, for he\r\nhad many and great advantages. But he was not of her station, and to\r\nmarry her was not in his mind. Perils were closing round her, and the\r\ncircle was fast darkening, when I--being as you have said, sir, too\r\nold and broken to be suspected of any feeling for her but a\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s--stepped in, and counselled flight. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, there\r\nare times of moral danger when the hardest virtuous resolution to form\r\nis flight, and when the most heroic bravery is flight.\xe2\x80\x9d She answered,\r\nshe had had this in her thoughts; but whither to fly without help she\r\nknew not, and there were none to help her. I showed her there was one to\r\nhelp her, and it was I. And she is gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you do with her?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Fledgeby, feeling his cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I placed her,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, \xe2\x80\x98at a distance;\xe2\x80\x99 with a grave smooth\r\noutward sweep from one another of his two open hands at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98at a distance--among certain of our people, where her industry would\r\nserve her, and where she could hope to exercise it, unassailed from any\r\nquarter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had come from the fire to notice the action of his hands\r\nwhen he said \xe2\x80\x98at a distance.\xe2\x80\x99 Fledgeby now tried (very unsuccessfully)\r\nto imitate that action, as he shook his head and said, \xe2\x80\x98Placed her in\r\nthat direction, did you? Oh you circular old dodger!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith one hand across his breast and the other on the easy chair, Riah,\r\nwithout justifying himself, waited for further questioning. But, that it\r\nwas hopeless to question him on that one reserved point, Fledgeby, with\r\nhis small eyes too near together, saw full well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, looking at the fire again, and then looking up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humph, Lizzie. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me the other name in your garden atop of\r\nthe house. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be more communicative with you. The other name\xe2\x80\x99s Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiah bent his head in assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, you sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I have a notion I know something\r\nof the inveigling chap, the powerful one. Has he anything to do with the\r\nlaw?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nominally, I believe it his calling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought so. Name anything like Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, not at all like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, old \xe2\x80\x98un,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, meeting his eyes with a wink, \xe2\x80\x98say the\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jupiter!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98That one, is it? I thought it might be\r\nthe other, but I never dreamt of that one! I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t object to your\r\nbaulking either of the pair, dodger, for they are both conceited enough;\r\nbut that one is as cool a customer as ever I met with. Got a beard\r\nbesides, and presumes upon it. Well done, old \xe2\x80\x98un! Go on and prosper!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBrightened by this unexpected commendation, Riah asked were there more\r\ninstructions for him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98you may toddle now, Judah, and grope about on the\r\norders you have got.\xe2\x80\x99 Dismissed with those pleasing words, the old man\r\ntook his broad hat and staff, and left the great presence: more as if he\r\nwere some superior creature benignantly blessing Mr Fledgeby, than the\r\npoor dependent on whom he set his foot. Left alone, Mr Fledgeby locked\r\nhis outer door, and came back to his fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done you!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fascination to himself. \xe2\x80\x98Slow, you may be; sure,\r\nyou are!\xe2\x80\x99 This he twice or thrice repeated with much complacency, as he\r\nagain dispersed the legs of the Turkish trousers and bent the knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A tidy shot that, I flatter myself,\xe2\x80\x99 he then soliloquised. \xe2\x80\x98And a Jew\r\nbrought down with it! Now, when I heard the story told at Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s, I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t make a jump at Riah. Not a hit of it; I got at him by degrees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHerein he was quite accurate; it being his habit, not to jump, or\r\nleap, or make an upward spring, at anything in life, but to crawl at\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I got at him,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Fledgeby, feeling for his whisker, \xe2\x80\x98by degrees.\r\nIf your Lammles or your Lightwoods had got at him anyhow, they would\r\nhave asked him the question whether he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t something to do with that\r\ngal\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance. I knew a better way of going to work. Having got\r\nbehind the hedge, and put him in the light, I took a shot at him and\r\nbrought him down plump. Oh! It don\xe2\x80\x99t count for much, being a Jew, in a\r\nmatch against ME!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother dry twist in place of a smile, made his face crooked here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to Christians,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98look out, fellow-Christians,\r\nparticularly you that lodge in Queer Street! I have got the run of Queer\r\nStreet now, and you shall see some games there. To work a lot of power\r\nover you and you not know it, knowing as you think yourselves, would\r\nbe almost worth laying out money upon. But when it comes to squeezing a\r\nprofit out of you into the bargain, it\xe2\x80\x99s something like!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this apostrophe Mr Fledgeby appropriately proceeded to divest\r\nhimself of his Turkish garments, and invest himself with Christian\r\nattire. Pending which operation, and his morning ablutions, and his\r\nanointing of himself with the last infallible preparation for the\r\nproduction of luxuriant and glossy hair upon the human countenance\r\n(quacks being the only sages he believed in besides usurers), the murky\r\nfog closed about him and shut him up in its sooty embrace. If it had\r\nnever let him out any more, the world would have had no irreparable\r\nloss, but could have easily replaced him from its stock on hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nA RESPECTED FRIEND IN A NEW ASPECT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening of this same foggy day when the yellow window-blind of\r\nPubsey and Co. was drawn down upon the day\xe2\x80\x99s work, Riah the Jew once\r\nmore came forth into Saint Mary Axe. But this time he carried no bag,\r\nand was not bound on his master\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. He passed over London Bridge,\r\nand returned to the Middlesex shore by that of Westminster, and so, ever\r\nwading through the fog, waded to the doorstep of the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker.\r\n\r\nMiss Wren expected him. He could see her through the window by the light\r\nof her low fire--carefully banked up with damp cinders that it might\r\nlast the longer and waste the less when she was out--sitting waiting\r\nfor him in her bonnet. His tap at the glass roused her from the musing\r\nsolitude in which she sat, and she came to the door to open it; aiding\r\nher steps with a little crutch-stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good evening, godmother!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny Wren.\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed, and gave her his arm to lean on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come in and warm yourself, godmother?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Jenny Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not if you are ready, Cinderella, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren, delighted. \xe2\x80\x98Now you ARE a clever old boy!\r\nIf we gave prizes at this establishment (but we only keep blanks), you\r\nshould have the first silver medal, for taking me up so quick.\xe2\x80\x99 As she\r\nspake thus, Miss Wren removed the key of the house-door from the keyhole\r\nand put it in her pocket, and then bustlingly closed the door, and tried\r\nit as they both stood on the step. Satisfied that her dwelling was safe,\r\nshe drew one hand through the old man\xe2\x80\x99s arm and prepared to ply her\r\ncrutch-stick with the other. But the key was an instrument of such\r\ngigantic proportions, that before they started Riah proposed to carry\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no! I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry it myself,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully\r\nlopsided, you know, and stowed down in my pocket it\xe2\x80\x99ll trim the ship. To\r\nlet you into a secret, godmother, I wear my pocket on my high side, o\xe2\x80\x99\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that they began their plodding through the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it was truly sharp of you, godmother,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Miss Wren with\r\ngreat approbation, \xe2\x80\x98to understand me. But, you see, you ARE so like the\r\nfairy godmother in the bright little books! You look so unlike the rest\r\nof people, and so much as if you had changed yourself into that shape,\r\njust this moment, with some benevolent object. Boh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Jenny,\r\nputting her face close to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x98I can see your features,\r\ngodmother, behind the beard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does the fancy go to my changing other objects too, Jenny?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! That it does! If you\xe2\x80\x99d only borrow my stick and tap this piece of\r\npavement--this dirty stone that my foot taps--it would start up a coach\r\nand six. I say! Let\xe2\x80\x99s believe so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the good old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I must ask you to do, godmother. I must ask you\r\nto be so kind as give my child a tap, and change him altogether. O my\r\nchild has been such a bad, bad child of late! It worries me nearly\r\nout of my wits. Not done a stroke of work these ten days. Has had the\r\nhorrors, too, and fancied that four copper-coloured men in red wanted to\r\nthrow him into a fiery furnace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous, Jenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dangerous, godmother? My child is always dangerous, more or less. He\r\nmight\xe2\x80\x99--here the little creature glanced back over her shoulder at the\r\nsky--\xe2\x80\x98be setting the house on fire at this present moment. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwho would have a child, for my part! It\xe2\x80\x99s no use shaking him. I have\r\nshaken him till I have made myself giddy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind your\r\nCommandments and honour your parent, you naughty old boy?\xe2\x80\x9d I said to him\r\nall the time. But he only whimpered and stared at me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What shall be changed, after him?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riah in a compassionately\r\nplayful voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, godmother, I am afraid I must be selfish next, and get\r\nyou to set me right in the back and the legs. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little thing to you\r\nwith your power, godmother, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal to poor weak aching\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no querulous complaining in the words, but they were not the\r\nless touching for that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and then--YOU know, godmother. We\xe2\x80\x99ll both jump up into the coach\r\nand six and go to Lizzie. This reminds me, godmother, to ask you a\r\nserious question. You are as wise as wise can be (having been brought\r\nup by the fairies), and you can tell me this: Is it better to have had a\r\ngood thing and lost it, or never to have had it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Explain, god-daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel so much more solitary and helpless without Lizzie now, than I\r\nused to feel before I knew her.\xe2\x80\x99 (Tears were in her eyes as she said\r\nso.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some beloved companionship fades out of most lives, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nJew,--\xe2\x80\x98that of a wife, and a fair daughter, and a son of promise, has\r\nfaded out of my own life--but the happiness was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren thoughtfully, by no means convinced, and chopping\r\nthe exclamation with that sharp little hatchet of hers; \xe2\x80\x98then I tell you\r\nwhat change I think you had better begin with, godmother. You had better\r\nchange Is into Was and Was into Is, and keep them so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would that suit your case? Would you not be always in pain then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked\r\nthe old man tenderly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren with another chop. \xe2\x80\x98You have changed me\r\nwiser, godmother.--Not,\xe2\x80\x99 she added with the quaint hitch of her chin and\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x98that you need be a very wonderful godmother to do that deed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus conversing, and having crossed Westminster Bridge, they traversed\r\nthe ground that Riah had lately traversed, and new ground likewise; for,\r\nwhen they had recrossed the Thames by way of London Bridge, they struck\r\ndown by the river and held their still foggier course that way.\r\n\r\nBut previously, as they were going along, Jenny twisted her venerable\r\nfriend aside to a brilliantly-lighted toy-shop window, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\nlook at \xe2\x80\x98em! All my work!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis referred to a dazzling semicircle of dolls in all the colours of\r\nthe rainbow, who were dressed for presentation at court, for going to\r\nballs, for going out driving, for going out on horseback, for going out\r\nwalking, for going to get married, for going to help other dolls to get\r\nmarried, for all the gay events of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty, pretty, pretty!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man with a clap of his hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most elegant taste!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad you like \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren, loftily. \xe2\x80\x98But the fun is,\r\ngodmother, how I make the great ladies try my dresses on. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe hardest part of my business, and would be, even if my back were not\r\nbad and my legs queer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at her as not understanding what she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless you, godmother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98I have to scud about town at\r\nall hours. If it was only sitting at my bench, cutting out and sewing,\r\nit would be comparatively easy work; but it\xe2\x80\x99s the trying-on by the great\r\nladies that takes it out of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How, the trying-on?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a mooney godmother you are, after all!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Look\r\nhere. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Drawing Room, or a grand day in the Park, or a Show, or\r\na Fete, or what you like. Very well. I squeeze among the crowd, and I\r\nlook about me. When I see a great lady very suitable for my business, I\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll do, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d and I take particular notice of her, and run\r\nhome and cut her out and baste her. Then another day, I come scudding\r\nback again to try on, and then I take particular notice of her again.\r\nSometimes she plainly seems to say, \xe2\x80\x98How that little creature is\r\nstaring!\xe2\x80\x99 and sometimes likes it and sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t, but much more\r\noften yes than no. All the time I am only saying to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nhollow out a bit here; I must slope away there;\xe2\x80\x9d and I am making a\r\nperfect slave of her, with making her try on my doll\xe2\x80\x99s dress. Evening\r\nparties are severer work for me, because there\xe2\x80\x99s only a doorway for a\r\nfull view, and what with hobbling among the wheels of the carriages\r\nand the legs of the horses, I fully expect to be run over some night.\r\nHowever, there I have \xe2\x80\x98em, just the same. When they go bobbing into the\r\nhall from the carriage, and catch a glimpse of my little physiognomy\r\npoked out from behind a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s cape in the rain, I dare say they\r\nthink I am wondering and admiring with all my eyes and heart, but they\r\nlittle think they\xe2\x80\x99re only working for my dolls! There was Lady Belinda\r\nWhitrose. I made her do double duty in one night. I said when she came\r\nout of the carriage, \xe2\x80\x9cYOU\xe2\x80\x99ll do, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d and I ran straight home and\r\ncut her out and basted her. Back I came again, and waited behind the men\r\nthat called the carriages. Very bad night too. At last, \xe2\x80\x9cLady Belinda\r\nWhitrose\xe2\x80\x99s carriage! Lady Belinda Whitrose coming down!\xe2\x80\x9d And I made her\r\ntry on--oh! and take pains about it too--before she got seated. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nLady Belinda hanging up by the waist, much too near the gaslight for a\r\nwax one, with her toes turned in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they had plodded on for some time nigh the river, Riah asked\r\nthe way to a certain tavern called the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.\r\nFollowing the directions he received, they arrived, after two or three\r\npuzzled stoppages for consideration, and some uncertain looking about\r\nthem, at the door of Miss Abbey Potterson\xe2\x80\x99s dominions. A peep through\r\nthe glass portion of the door revealed to them the glories of the bar,\r\nand Miss Abbey herself seated in state on her snug throne, reading the\r\nnewspaper. To whom, with deference, they presented themselves.\r\n\r\nTaking her eyes off her newspaper, and pausing with a suspended\r\nexpression of countenance, as if she must finish the paragraph in hand\r\nbefore undertaking any other business whatever, Miss Abbey demanded,\r\nwith some slight asperity: \xe2\x80\x98Now then, what\xe2\x80\x99s for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could we see Miss Potterson?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the old man, uncovering his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You not only could, but you can and you do,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might we speak with you, madam?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy this time Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had possessed themselves of the small\r\nfigure of Miss Jenny Wren. For the closer observation of which, Miss\r\nAbbey laid aside her newspaper, rose, and looked over the half-door of\r\nthe bar. The crutch-stick seemed to entreat for its owner leave to come\r\nin and rest by the fire; so, Miss Abbey opened the half-door, and said,\r\nas though replying to the crutch-stick:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, come in and rest by the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, with courteous action, \xe2\x80\x98and my\r\navocation is in London city. This, my young companion--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give the lady my card.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nproduced it from her pocket with an air, after struggling with the\r\ngigantic door-key which had got upon the top of it and kept it down.\r\nMiss Abbey, with manifest tokens of astonishment, took the diminutive\r\ndocument, and found it to run concisely thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tMISS JENNY WREN\r\n\r\n\t       DOLLS\xe2\x80\x99 DRESSMAKER.\r\n\r\n\tDolls attended at their own residences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lud!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Potterson, staring. And dropped the card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We take the liberty of coming, my young companion and I, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRiah, \xe2\x80\x98on behalf of Lizzie Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Potterson was stooping to loosen the bonnet-strings of the dolls\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndressmaker. She looked round rather angrily, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Lizzie Hexam is\r\na very proud young woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She would be so proud,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Riah, dexterously, \xe2\x80\x98to stand well in\r\nyour good opinion, that before she quitted London for--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For where, in the name of the Cape of Good Hope?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Potterson,\r\nas though supposing her to have emigrated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the country,\xe2\x80\x99 was the cautious answer,--\xe2\x80\x98she made us promise to\r\ncome and show you a paper, which she left in our hands for that special\r\npurpose. I am an unserviceable friend of hers, who began to know her\r\nafter her departure from this neighbourhood. She has been for some time\r\nliving with my young companion, and has been a helpful and a comfortable\r\nfriend to her. Much needed, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, in a lower voice. \xe2\x80\x98Believe\r\nme; if you knew all, much needed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can believe that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, with a softening glance at the\r\nlittle creature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if it\xe2\x80\x99s proud to have a heart that never hardens, and a temper\r\nthat never tires, and a touch that never hurts,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Jenny struck in,\r\nflushed, \xe2\x80\x98she is proud. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not, she is NOT.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer set purpose of contradicting Miss Abbey point blank, was so far from\r\noffending that dread authority, as to elicit a gracious smile. \xe2\x80\x98You do\r\nright, child,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98to speak well of those who deserve well\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right or wrong,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Miss Wren, inaudibly, with a visible hitch of\r\nher chin, \xe2\x80\x98I mean to do it, and you may make up your mind to THAT, old\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is the paper, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Jew, delivering into Miss\r\nPotterson\xe2\x80\x99s hands the original document drawn up by Rokesmith, and\r\nsigned by Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Will you please to read it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But first of all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98--did you ever taste shrub,\r\nchild?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Wren shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should you like to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should if it\xe2\x80\x99s good,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall try. And, if you find it good, I\xe2\x80\x99ll mix some for you with hot\r\nwater. Put your poor little feet on the fender. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cold, cold night,\r\nand the fog clings so.\xe2\x80\x99 As Miss Abbey helped her to turn her chair, her\r\nloosened bonnet dropped on the floor. \xe2\x80\x98Why, what lovely hair!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nMiss Abbey. \xe2\x80\x98And enough to make wigs for all the dolls in the world.\r\nWhat a quantity!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call THAT a quantity?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Poof! What do you say to\r\nthe rest of it?\xe2\x80\x99 As she spoke, she untied a band, and the golden stream\r\nfell over herself and over the chair, and flowed down to the ground.\r\nMiss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s admiration seemed to increase her perplexity. She beckoned\r\nthe Jew towards her, as she reached down the shrub-bottle from its\r\nniche, and whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Child, or woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Child in years,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer; \xe2\x80\x98woman in self-reliance and trial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are talking about Me, good people,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Miss Jenny, sitting in\r\nher golden bower, warming her feet. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear what you say, but I\r\nknow your tricks and your manners!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe shrub, when tasted from a spoon, perfectly harmonizing with Miss\r\nJenny\xe2\x80\x99s palate, a judicious amount was mixed by Miss Potterson\xe2\x80\x99s skilful\r\nhands, whereof Riah too partook. After this preliminary, Miss Abbey read\r\nthe document; and, as often as she raised her eyebrows in so doing,\r\nthe watchful Miss Jenny accompanied the action with an expressive and\r\nemphatic sip of the shrub and water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As far as this goes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey Potterson, when she had read it\r\nseveral times, and thought about it, \xe2\x80\x98it proves (what didn\xe2\x80\x99t much need\r\nproving) that Rogue Riderhood is a villain. I have my doubts whether he\r\nis not the villain who solely did the deed; but I have no expectation of\r\nthose doubts ever being cleared up now. I believe I did Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nwrong, but never Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s self; because when things were at the worst I\r\ntrusted her, had perfect confidence in her, and tried to persuade her\r\nto come to me for a refuge. I am very sorry to have done a man wrong,\r\nparticularly when it can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone. Be kind enough to let Lizzie know\r\nwhat I say; not forgetting that if she will come to the Porters, after\r\nall, bygones being bygones, she will find a home at the Porters, and a\r\nfriend at the Porters. She knows Miss Abbey of old, remind her, and she\r\nknows what-like the home, and what-like the friend, is likely to turn\r\nout. I am generally short and sweet--or short and sour, according as it\r\nmay be and as opinions vary--\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s about\r\nall I have got to say, and enough too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut before the shrub and water was sipped out, Miss Abbey bethought\r\nherself that she would like to keep a copy of the paper by her. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot long, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said she to Riah, \xe2\x80\x98and perhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind just\r\njotting it down.\xe2\x80\x99 The old man willingly put on his spectacles, and,\r\nstanding at the little desk in the corner where Miss Abbey filed her\r\nreceipts and kept her sample phials (customers\xe2\x80\x99 scores were interdicted\r\nby the strict administration of the Porters), wrote out the copy in\r\na fair round character. As he stood there, doing his methodical\r\npenmanship, his ancient scribelike figure intent upon the work, and the\r\nlittle dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker sitting in her golden bower before the fire,\r\nMiss Abbey had her doubts whether she had not dreamed those two rare\r\nfigures into the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowships, and might not wake\r\nwith a nod next moment and find them gone.\r\n\r\nMiss Abbey had twice made the experiment of shutting her eyes and\r\nopening them again, still finding the figures there, when, dreamlike,\r\na confused hubbub arose in the public room. As she started up, and they\r\nall three looked at one another, it became a noise of clamouring voices\r\nand of the stir of feet; then all the windows were heard to be hastily\r\nthrown up, and shouts and cries came floating into the house from\r\nthe river. A moment more, and Bob Gliddery came clattering along the\r\npassage, with the noise of all the nails in his boots condensed into\r\nevery separate nail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s summut run down in the fog, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bob. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s ever so\r\nmany people in the river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell \xe2\x80\x98em to put on all the kettles!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Abbey. \xe2\x80\x98See that the\r\nboiler\xe2\x80\x99s full. Get a bath out. Hang some blankets to the fire. Heat some\r\nstone bottles. Have your senses about you, you girls down stairs, and\r\nuse \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Abbey partly delivered these directions to Bob--whom she\r\nseized by the hair, and whose head she knocked against the wall, as a\r\ngeneral injunction to vigilance and presence of mind--and partly hailed\r\nthe kitchen with them--the company in the public room, jostling one\r\nanother, rushed out to the causeway, and the outer noise increased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come and look,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey to her visitors. They all three hurried\r\nto the vacated public room, and passed by one of the windows into the\r\nwooden verandah overhanging the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does anybody down there know what has happened?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Miss Abbey,\r\nin her voice of authority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a steamer, Miss Abbey,\xe2\x80\x99 cried one blurred figure in the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It always IS a steamer, Miss Abbey,\xe2\x80\x99 cried another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Them\xe2\x80\x99s her lights, Miss Abbey, wot you see a-blinking yonder,\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a-blowing off her steam, Miss Abbey, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the\r\nfog and the noise worse, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x99 explained another.\r\n\r\nBoats were putting off, torches were lighting up, people were rushing\r\ntumultuously to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. Some man fell in with a splash, and\r\nwas pulled out again with a roar of laughter. The drags were called for.\r\nA cry for the life-buoy passed from mouth to mouth. It was impossible to\r\nmake out what was going on upon the river, for every boat that put off\r\nsculled into the fog and was lost to view at a boat\xe2\x80\x99s length. Nothing\r\nwas clear but that the unpopular steamer was assailed with reproaches\r\non all sides. She was the Murderer, bound for Gallows Bay; she was the\r\nManslaughterer, bound for Penal Settlement; her captain ought to be\r\ntried for his life; her crew ran down men in row-boats with a relish;\r\nshe mashed up Thames lightermen with her paddles; she fired property\r\nwith her funnels; she always was, and she always would be, wreaking\r\ndestruction upon somebody or something, after the manner of all her\r\nkind. The whole bulk of the fog teemed with such taunts, uttered in\r\ntones of universal hoarseness. All the while, the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s lights moved\r\nspectrally a very little, as she lay-to, waiting the upshot of whatever\r\naccident had happened. Now, she began burning blue-lights. These made a\r\nluminous patch about her, as if she had set the fog on fire, and in the\r\npatch--the cries changing their note, and becoming more fitful and more\r\nexcited--shadows of men and boats could be seen moving, while voices\r\nshouted: \xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98There again!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98A couple more strokes a-head!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Look out!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Hold on!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Haul in!\xe2\x80\x99 and the like. Lastly, with\r\na few tumbling clots of blue fire, the night closed in dark again,\r\nthe wheels of the steamer were heard revolving, and her lights glided\r\nsmoothly away in the direction of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to Miss Abbey and her two companions that a considerable\r\ntime had been thus occupied. There was now as eager a set towards the\r\nshore beneath the house as there had been from it; and it was only\r\non the first boat of the rush coming in that it was known what had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Tootle,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Abbey made proclamation, in her most\r\ncommanding tones, \xe2\x80\x98let him instantly come underneath here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe submissive Tom complied, attended by a crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it, Tootle?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Miss Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a foreign steamer, miss, run down a wherry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How many in the wherry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One man, Miss Abbey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Found?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He\xe2\x80\x99s been under water a long time, Miss; but they\xe2\x80\x99ve grappled up\r\nthe body.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let \xe2\x80\x98em bring it here. You, Bob Gliddery, shut the house-door and stand\r\nby it on the inside, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you open till I tell you. Any police down\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, Miss Abbey,\xe2\x80\x99 was official rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After they have brought the body in, keep the crowd out, will you? And\r\nhelp Bob Gliddery to shut \xe2\x80\x98em out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Miss Abbey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe autocratic landlady withdrew into the house with Riah and Miss\r\nJenny, and disposed those forces, one on either side of her, within the\r\nhalf-door of the bar, as behind a breastwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You two stand close here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98and you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to no\r\nhurt, and see it brought in. Bob, you stand by the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat sentinel, smartly giving his rolled shirt-sleeves an extra and a\r\nfinal tuck on his shoulders, obeyed.\r\n\r\nSound of advancing voices, sound of advancing steps. Shuffle and talk\r\nwithout. Momentary pause. Two peculiarly blunt knocks or pokes at the\r\ndoor, as if the dead man arriving on his back were striking at it with\r\nthe soles of his motionless feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the stretcher, or the shutter, whichever of the two they are\r\ncarrying,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, with experienced ear. \xe2\x80\x98Open, you Bob!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDoor opened. Heavy tread of laden men. A halt. A rush. Stoppage of rush.\r\nDoor shut. Baffled boots from the vexed souls of disappointed outsiders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come on, men!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey; for so potent was she with her subjects\r\nthat even then the bearers awaited her permission. \xe2\x80\x98First floor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe entry being low, and the staircase being low, they so took up the\r\nburden they had set down, as to carry that low. The recumbent figure, in\r\npassing, lay hardly as high as the half door.\r\n\r\nMiss Abbey started back at sight of it. \xe2\x80\x98Why, good God!\xe2\x80\x99 said she,\r\nturning to her two companions, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s the very man who made the\r\ndeclaration we have just had in our hands. That\xe2\x80\x99s Riderhood!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nTHE SAME RESPECTED FRIEND IN MORE ASPECTS THAN ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sooth, it is Riderhood and no other, or it is the outer husk and\r\nshell of Riderhood and no other, that is borne into Miss Abbey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfirst-floor bedroom. Supple to twist and turn as the Rogue has ever\r\nbeen, he is sufficiently rigid now; and not without much shuffling of\r\nattendant feet, and tilting of his bier this way and that way, and\r\nperil even of his sliding off it and being tumbled in a heap over the\r\nbalustrades, can he be got up stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fetch a doctor,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Miss Abbey. And then, \xe2\x80\x98Fetch his daughter.\xe2\x80\x99 On\r\nboth of which errands, quick messengers depart.\r\n\r\nThe doctor-seeking messenger meets the doctor halfway, coming under\r\nconvoy of police. Doctor examines the dank carcase, and pronounces, not\r\nhopefully, that it is worth while trying to reanimate the same. All the\r\nbest means are at once in action, and everybody present lends a hand,\r\nand a heart and soul. No one has the least regard for the man; with them\r\nall, he has been an object of avoidance, suspicion, and aversion; but\r\nthe spark of life within him is curiously separable from himself now,\r\nand they have a deep interest in it, probably because it IS life, and\r\nthey are living and must die.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry how did it happen, and was anyone to\r\nblame, Tom Tootle gives in his verdict, unavoidable accident and no one\r\nto blame but the sufferer. \xe2\x80\x98He was slinking about in his boat,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nTom, \xe2\x80\x98which slinking were, not to speak ill of the dead, the manner of\r\nthe man, when he come right athwart the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s bows and she cut him\r\nin two.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Tootle is so far figurative, touching the dismemberment, as\r\nthat he means the boat, and not the man. For, the man lies whole before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCaptain Joey, the bottle-nosed regular customer in the glazed hat, is a\r\npupil of the much-respected old school, and (having insinuated himself\r\ninto the chamber, in the execution of the important service of carrying\r\nthe drowned man\xe2\x80\x99s neck-kerchief) favours the doctor with a sagacious\r\nold-scholastic suggestion that the body should be hung up by the heels,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98sim\xe2\x80\x99lar\xe2\x80\x99, says Captain Joey, \xe2\x80\x98to mutton in a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nshould then, as a particularly choice manoeuvre for promoting easy\r\nrespiration, be rolled upon casks. These scraps of the wisdom of the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s ancestors are received with such speechless indignation by\r\nMiss Abbey, that she instantly seizes the Captain by the collar, and\r\nwithout a single word ejects him, not presuming to remonstrate, from the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nThere then remain, to assist the doctor and Tom, only those three other\r\nregular customers, Bob Glamour, William Williams, and Jonathan (family\r\nname of the latter, if any, unknown to man-kind), who are quite enough.\r\nMiss Abbey having looked in to make sure that nothing is wanted,\r\ndescends to the bar, and there awaits the result, with the gentle Jew\r\nand Miss Jenny Wren.\r\n\r\nIf you are not gone for good, Mr Riderhood, it would be something to\r\nknow where you are hiding at present. This flabby lump of mortality that\r\nwe work so hard at with such patient perseverance, yields no sign of\r\nyou. If you are gone for good, Rogue, it is very solemn, and if you are\r\ncoming back, it is hardly less so. Nay, in the suspense and mystery of\r\nthe latter question, involving that of where you may be now, there is a\r\nsolemnity even added to that of death, making us who are in attendance\r\nalike afraid to look on you and to look off you, and making those below\r\nstart at the least sound of a creaking plank in the floor.\r\n\r\nStay! Did that eyelid tremble? So the doctor, breathing low, and closely\r\nwatching, asks himself.\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nDid that nostril twitch?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThis artificial respiration ceasing, do I feel any faint flutter under\r\nmy hand upon the chest?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nOver and over again No. No. But try over and over again, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nSee! A token of life! An indubitable token of life! The spark may\r\nsmoulder and go out, or it may glow and expand, but see! The four\r\nrough fellows, seeing, shed tears. Neither Riderhood in this world, nor\r\nRiderhood in the other, could draw tears from them; but a striving human\r\nsoul between the two can do it easily.\r\n\r\nHe is struggling to come back. Now, he is almost here, now he is far\r\naway again. Now he is struggling harder to get back. And yet--like us\r\nall, when we swoon--like us all, every day of our lives when we wake--he\r\nis instinctively unwilling to be restored to the consciousness of this\r\nexistence, and would be left dormant, if he could.\r\n\r\nBob Gliddery returns with Pleasant Riderhood, who was out when sought\r\nfor, and hard to find. She has a shawl over her head, and her first\r\naction, when she takes it off weeping, and curtseys to Miss Abbey, is to\r\nwind her hair up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Miss Abbey, for having father here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am bound to say, girl, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who it was,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Miss Abbey;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I hope it would have been pretty much the same if I had known.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Pleasant, fortified with a sip of brandy, is ushered into the\r\nfirst-floor chamber. She could not express much sentiment about her\r\nfather if she were called upon to pronounce his funeral oration, but she\r\nhas a greater tenderness for him than he ever had for her, and crying\r\nbitterly when she sees him stretched unconscious, asks the doctor, with\r\nclasped hands: \xe2\x80\x98Is there no hope, sir? O poor father! Is poor father\r\ndead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which the doctor, on one knee beside the body, busy and watchful,\r\nonly rejoins without looking round: \xe2\x80\x98Now, my girl, unless you have the\r\nself-command to be perfectly quiet, I cannot allow you to remain in the\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPleasant, consequently, wipes her eyes with her back-hair, which is in\r\nfresh need of being wound up, and having got it out of the way, watches\r\nwith terrified interest all that goes on. Her natural woman\xe2\x80\x99s aptitude\r\nsoon renders her able to give a little help. Anticipating the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwant of this or that, she quietly has it ready for him, and so by\r\ndegrees is intrusted with the charge of supporting her father\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nupon her arm.\r\n\r\nIt is something so new to Pleasant to see her father an object of\r\nsympathy and interest, to find any one very willing to tolerate his\r\nsociety in this world, not to say pressingly and soothingly entreating\r\nhim to belong to it, that it gives her a sensation she never experienced\r\nbefore. Some hazy idea that if affairs could remain thus for a long time\r\nit would be a respectable change, floats in her mind. Also some vague\r\nidea that the old evil is drowned out of him, and that if he should\r\nhappily come back to resume his occupation of the empty form that lies\r\nupon the bed, his spirit will be altered. In which state of mind she\r\nkisses the stony lips, and quite believes that the impassive hand she\r\nchafes will revive a tender hand, if it revive ever.\r\n\r\nSweet delusion for Pleasant Riderhood. But they minister to him with\r\nsuch extraordinary interest, their anxiety is so keen, their vigilance\r\nis so great, their excited joy grows so intense as the signs of life\r\nstrengthen, that how can she resist it, poor thing! And now he begins\r\nto breathe naturally, and he stirs, and the doctor declares him to have\r\ncome back from that inexplicable journey where he stopped on the dark\r\nroad, and to be here.\r\n\r\nTom Tootle, who is nearest to the doctor when he says this, grasps\r\nthe doctor fervently by the hand. Bob Glamour, William Williams, and\r\nJonathan of the no surname, all shake hands with one another round, and\r\nwith the doctor too. Bob Glamour blows his nose, and Jonathan of the\r\nno surname is moved to do likewise, but lacking a pocket handkerchief\r\nabandons that outlet for his emotion. Pleasant sheds tears deserving her\r\nown name, and her sweet delusion is at its height.\r\n\r\nThere is intelligence in his eyes. He wants to ask a question. He\r\nwonders where he is. Tell him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, you were run down on the river, and are at Miss Abbey\r\nPotterson\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stares at his daughter, stares all around him, closes his eyes, and\r\nlies slumbering on her arm.\r\n\r\nThe short-lived delusion begins to fade. The low, bad, unimpressible\r\nface is coming up from the depths of the river, or what other depths, to\r\nthe surface again. As he grows warm, the doctor and the four men cool.\r\nAs his lineaments soften with life, their faces and their hearts harden\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will do now,\xe2\x80\x99 says the doctor, washing his hands, and looking at the\r\npatient with growing disfavour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many a better man,\xe2\x80\x99 moralizes Tom Tootle with a gloomy shake of the\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x98ain\xe2\x80\x99t had his luck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s to be hoped he\xe2\x80\x99ll make a better use of his life,\xe2\x80\x99 says Bob\r\nGlamour, \xe2\x80\x98than I expect he will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or than he done afore,\xe2\x80\x99 adds William Williams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But no, not he!\xe2\x80\x99 says Jonathan of the no surname, clinching the\r\nquartette.\r\n\r\nThey speak in a low tone because of his daughter, but she sees that they\r\nhave all drawn off, and that they stand in a group at the other end of\r\nthe room, shunning him. It would be too much to suspect them of being\r\nsorry that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t die when he had done so much towards it, but they\r\nclearly wish that they had had a better subject to bestow their pains\r\non. Intelligence is conveyed to Miss Abbey in the bar, who reappears on\r\nthe scene, and contemplates from a distance, holding whispered discourse\r\nwith the doctor. The spark of life was deeply interesting while it was\r\nin abeyance, but now that it has got established in Mr Riderhood, there\r\nappears to be a general desire that circumstances had admitted of its\r\nbeing developed in anybody else, rather than that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 says Miss Abbey, cheering them up, \xe2\x80\x98you have done your duty\r\nlike good and true men, and you had better come down and take something\r\nat the expense of the Porters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis they all do, leaving the daughter watching the father. To whom, in\r\ntheir absence, Bob Gliddery presents himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His gills looks rum; don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99 says Bob, after inspecting the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nPleasant faintly nods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His gills\xe2\x80\x99ll look rummer when he wakes; won\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99 says Bob.\r\n\r\nPleasant hopes not. Why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he finds himself here, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 Bob explains. \xe2\x80\x98Cause Miss Abbey\r\nforbid him the house and ordered him out of it. But what you may call\r\nthe Fates ordered him into it again. Which is rumness; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come here of his own accord,\xe2\x80\x99 returns poor Pleasant,\r\nwith an effort at a little pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 retorts Bob. \xe2\x80\x98Nor he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been let in, if he had.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe short delusion is quite dispelled now. As plainly as she sees on her\r\narm the old father, unimproved, Pleasant sees that everybody there will\r\ncut him when he recovers consciousness. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him away ever so soon\r\nas I can,\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Pleasant with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s best at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPresently they all return, and wait for him to become conscious that\r\nthey will all be glad to get rid of him. Some clothes are got together\r\nfor him to wear, his own being saturated with water, and his present\r\ndress being composed of blankets.\r\n\r\nBecoming more and more uncomfortable, as though the prevalent dislike\r\nwere finding him out somewhere in his sleep and expressing itself to\r\nhim, the patient at last opens his eyes wide, and is assisted by his\r\ndaughter to sit up in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Riderhood,\xe2\x80\x99 says the doctor, \xe2\x80\x98how do you feel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe replies gruffly, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing to boast on.\xe2\x80\x99 Having, in fact, returned to\r\nlife in an uncommonly sulky state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to preach; but I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 says the doctor, gravely shaking\r\nhis head, \xe2\x80\x98that this escape may have a good effect upon you, Riderhood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe patient\xe2\x80\x99s discontented growl of a reply is not intelligible; his\r\ndaughter, however, could interpret, if she would, that what he says is,\r\nhe \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t want no Poll-Parroting\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nMr Riderhood next demands his shirt; and draws it on over his head (with\r\nhis daughter\xe2\x80\x99s help) exactly as if he had just had a Fight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Warn\xe2\x80\x99t it a steamer?\xe2\x80\x99 he pauses to ask her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the law on her, bust her! and make her pay for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe then buttons his linen very moodily, twice or thrice stopping to\r\nexamine his arms and hands, as if to see what punishment he has received\r\nin the Fight. He then doggedly demands his other garments, and slowly\r\ngets them on, with an appearance of great malevolence towards his late\r\nopponent and all the spectators. He has an impression that his nose is\r\nbleeding, and several times draws the back of his hand across it, and\r\nlooks for the result, in a pugilistic manner, greatly strengthening that\r\nincongruous resemblance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s my fur cap?\xe2\x80\x99 he asks in a surly voice, when he has shuffled his\r\nclothes on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the river,\xe2\x80\x99 somebody rejoins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And warn\xe2\x80\x99t there no honest man to pick it up? O\xe2\x80\x99 course there was\r\nthough, and to cut off with it arterwards. You are a rare lot, all on\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus, Mr Riderhood: taking from the hands of his daughter, with special\r\nill-will, a lent cap, and grumbling as he pulls it down over his ears.\r\nThen, getting on his unsteady legs, leaning heavily upon her, and\r\ngrowling, \xe2\x80\x98Hold still, can\xe2\x80\x99t you? What! You must be a staggering next,\r\nmust you?\xe2\x80\x99 he takes his departure out of the ring in which he has had\r\nthat little turn-up with Death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nA HAPPY RETURN OF THE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Wilfer had seen a full quarter of a hundred more\r\nanniversaries of their wedding day than Mr and Mrs Lammle had seen of\r\ntheirs, but they still celebrated the occasion in the bosom of\r\ntheir family. Not that these celebrations ever resulted in anything\r\nparticularly agreeable, or that the family was ever disappointed by that\r\ncircumstance on account of having looked forward to the return of the\r\nauspicious day with sanguine anticipations of enjoyment. It was kept\r\nmorally, rather as a Fast than a Feast, enabling Mrs Wilfer to hold\r\na sombre darkling state, which exhibited that impressive woman in her\r\nchoicest colours.\r\n\r\nThe noble lady\xe2\x80\x99s condition on these delightful occasions was one\r\ncompounded of heroic endurance and heroic forgiveness. Lurid indications\r\nof the better marriages she might have made, shone athwart the awful\r\ngloom of her composure, and fitfully revealed the cherub as a little\r\nmonster unaccountably favoured by Heaven, who had possessed himself of a\r\nblessing for which many of his superiors had sued and contended in vain.\r\nSo firmly had this his position towards his treasure become established,\r\nthat when the anniversary arrived, it always found him in an apologetic\r\nstate. It is not impossible that his modest penitence may have even gone\r\nthe length of sometimes severely reproving him for that he ever took the\r\nliberty of making so exalted a character his wife.\r\n\r\nAs for the children of the union, their experience of these festivals\r\nhad been sufficiently uncomfortable to lead them annually to wish, when\r\nout of their tenderest years, either that Ma had married somebody else\r\ninstead of much-teased Pa, or that Pa had married somebody else instead\r\nof Ma. When there came to be but two sisters left at home, the daring\r\nmind of Bella on the next of these occasions scaled the height of\r\nwondering with droll vexation \xe2\x80\x98what on earth Pa ever could have seen in\r\nMa, to induce him to make such a little fool of himself as to ask her to\r\nhave him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe revolving year now bringing the day round in its orderly sequence,\r\nBella arrived in the Boffin chariot to assist at the celebration. It was\r\nthe family custom when the day recurred, to sacrifice a pair of fowls\r\non the altar of Hymen; and Bella had sent a note beforehand, to intimate\r\nthat she would bring the votive offering with her. So, Bella and the\r\nfowls, by the united energies of two horses, two men, four wheels, and a\r\nplum-pudding carriage dog with as uncomfortable a collar on as if he\r\nhad been George the Fourth, were deposited at the door of the parental\r\ndwelling. They were there received by Mrs Wilfer in person, whose\r\ndignity on this, as on most special occasions, was heightened by a\r\nmysterious toothache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall not require the carriage at night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I shall walk\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe male domestic of Mrs Boffin touched his hat, and in the act of\r\ndeparture had an awful glare bestowed upon him by Mrs Wilfer, intended\r\nto carry deep into his audacious soul the assurance that, whatever his\r\nprivate suspicions might be, male domestics in livery were no rarity\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, dear Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98and how do you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am as well, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98as can be expected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98you talk as if one was just born!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Ma has been doing,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Lavvy, over the\r\nmaternal shoulder, \xe2\x80\x98ever since we got up this morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very\r\nwell to laugh, Bella, but anything more exasperating it is impossible to\r\nconceive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer, with a look too full of majesty to be accompanied by any\r\nwords, attended both her daughters to the kitchen, where the sacrifice\r\nwas to be prepared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, resignedly, \xe2\x80\x98has been so polite as to place\r\nhis sitting-room at our disposal to-day. You will therefore, Bella, be\r\nentertained in the humble abode of your parents, so far in accordance\r\nwith your present style of living, that there will be a drawing-room for\r\nyour reception as well as a dining-room. Your papa invited Mr Rokesmith\r\nto partake of our lowly fare. In excusing himself on account of a\r\nparticular engagement, he offered the use of his apartment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella happened to know that he had no engagement out of his own room at\r\nMr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s, but she approved of his staying away. \xe2\x80\x98We should only have\r\nput one another out of countenance,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98and we do that quite\r\noften enough as it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet she had sufficient curiosity about his room, to run up to it with\r\nthe least possible delay, and make a close inspection of its contents.\r\nIt was tastefully though economically furnished, and very neatly\r\narranged. There were shelves and stands of books, English, French, and\r\nItalian; and in a portfolio on the writing-table there were sheets upon\r\nsheets of memoranda and calculations in figures, evidently referring to\r\nthe Boffin property. On that table also, carefully backed with canvas,\r\nvarnished, mounted, and rolled like a map, was the placard descriptive\r\nof the murdered man who had come from afar to be her husband. She shrank\r\nfrom this ghostly surprise, and felt quite frightened as she rolled and\r\ntied it up again. Peeping about here and there, she came upon a print, a\r\ngraceful head of a pretty woman, elegantly framed, hanging in the corner\r\nby the easy chair. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, after stopping to\r\nruminate before it. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed, sir! I fancy I can guess whom you\r\nthink THAT\xe2\x80\x99S like. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it\xe2\x80\x99s much more like--your\r\nimpudence!\xe2\x80\x99 Having said which she decamped: not solely because she was\r\noffended, but because there was nothing else to look at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, reappearing in the kitchen with some remains of a\r\nblush, \xe2\x80\x98you and Lavvy think magnificent me fit for nothing, but I intend\r\nto prove the contrary. I mean to be Cook today.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined her majestic mother. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot permit it. Cook, in that\r\ndress!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for my dress, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, merrily searching in a\r\ndresser-drawer, \xe2\x80\x98I mean to apron it and towel it all over the front; and\r\nas to permission, I mean to do without.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU cook?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98YOU, who never cooked when you were at\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella; \xe2\x80\x98that is precisely the state of the case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe girded herself with a white apron, and busily with knots and pins\r\ncontrived a bib to it, coming close and tight under her chin, as if it\r\nhad caught her round the neck to kiss her. Over this bib her dimples\r\nlooked delightful, and under it her pretty figure not less so. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nMa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, pushing back her hair from her temples with both hands,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s first?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer solemnly, \xe2\x80\x98if you persist in what I cannot\r\nbut regard as conduct utterly incompatible with the equipage in which\r\nyou arrived--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Which I do, Ma.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First, then, you put the fowls down to the fire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To--be--sure!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella; \xe2\x80\x98and flour them, and twirl them round, and\r\nthere they go!\xe2\x80\x99 sending them spinning at a great rate. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s next,\r\nMa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer with a wave of her gloves, expressive of\r\nabdication under protest from the culinary throne, \xe2\x80\x98I would recommend\r\nexamination of the bacon in the saucepan on the fire, and also of the\r\npotatoes by the application of a fork. Preparation of the greens will\r\nfurther become necessary if you persist in this unseemly demeanour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As of course I do, Ma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPersisting, Bella gave her attention to one thing and forgot the\r\nother, and gave her attention to the other and forgot the third, and\r\nremembering the third was distracted by the fourth, and made amends\r\nwhenever she went wrong by giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin,\r\nwhich made their chance of ever getting cooked exceedingly doubtful. But\r\nit was pleasant cookery too. Meantime Miss Lavinia, oscillating between\r\nthe kitchen and the opposite room, prepared the dining-table in the\r\nlatter chamber. This office she (always doing her household spiriting\r\nwith unwillingness) performed in a startling series of whisks and bumps;\r\nlaying the table-cloth as if she were raising the wind, putting down\r\nthe glasses and salt-cellars as if she were knocking at the door, and\r\nclashing the knives and forks in a skirmishing manner suggestive of\r\nhand-to-hand conflict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Lavinia to Bella when this was done, and they\r\nstood over the roasting fowls. \xe2\x80\x98If one was the most dutiful child in\r\nexistence (of course on the whole one hopes one is), isn\xe2\x80\x99t she enough\r\nto make one want to poke her with something wooden, sitting there bolt\r\nupright in a corner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that poor Pa was to sit bolt upright in\r\nanother corner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy. \xe2\x80\x98Pa would loll directly. But\r\nindeed I do not believe there ever was any human creature who could keep\r\nso bolt upright as Ma, \xe2\x80\x98or put such an amount of aggravation into one\r\nback! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Ma? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you well, Ma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doubtless I am very well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, turning her eyes upon\r\nher youngest born, with scornful fortitude. \xe2\x80\x98What should be the matter\r\nwith Me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very brisk, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Lavvy the bold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brisk?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated her parent, \xe2\x80\x98Brisk? Whence the low expression,\r\nLavinia? If I am uncomplaining, if I am silently contented with my lot,\r\nlet that suffice for my family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavvy, \xe2\x80\x98since you will force it out of me, I must\r\nrespectfully take leave to say that your family are no doubt under\r\nthe greatest obligations to you for having an annual toothache on your\r\nwedding day, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s very disinterested in you, and an immense\r\nblessing to them. Still, on the whole, it is possible to be too boastful\r\neven of that boon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You incarnation of sauciness,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98do you speak like that\r\nto me? On this day, of all days in the year? Pray do you know what\r\nwould have become of you, if I had not bestowed my hand upon R. W., your\r\nfather, on this day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Lavvy, \xe2\x80\x98I really do not; and, with the greatest\r\nrespect for your abilities and information, I very much doubt if you do\r\neither.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether or no the sharp vigour of this sally on a weak point of Mrs\r\nWilfer\xe2\x80\x99s entrenchments might have routed that heroine for the time, is\r\nrendered uncertain by the arrival of a flag of truce in the person of\r\nMr George Sampson: bidden to the feast as a friend of the family, whose\r\naffections were now understood to be in course of transference from\r\nBella to Lavinia, and whom Lavinia kept--possibly in remembrance of his\r\nbad taste in having overlooked her in the first instance--under a course\r\nof stinging discipline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I congratulate you, Mrs Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr George Sampson, who had\r\nmeditated this neat address while coming along, \xe2\x80\x98on the day.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer\r\nthanked him with a magnanimous sigh, and again became an unresisting\r\nprey to that inscrutable toothache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am surprised,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Sampson feebly, \xe2\x80\x98that Miss Bella condescends\r\nto cook.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Miss Lavinia descended on the ill-starred young gentleman with a\r\ncrushing supposition that at all events it was no business of his. This\r\ndisposed of Mr Sampson in a melancholy retirement of spirit, until the\r\ncherub arrived, whose amazement at the lovely woman\xe2\x80\x99s occupation was\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nHowever, she persisted in dishing the dinner as well as cooking it, and\r\nthen sat down, bibless and apronless, to partake of it as an illustrious\r\nguest: Mrs Wilfer first responding to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful \xe2\x80\x98For what\r\nwe are about to receive--\xe2\x80\x99 with a sepulchral Amen, calculated to cast a\r\ndamp upon the stoutest appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, as she watched the carving of the fowls, \xe2\x80\x98makes\r\nthem pink inside, I wonder, Pa! Is it the breed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the breed, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Pa. \xe2\x80\x98I rather\r\nthink it is because they are not done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They ought to be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am aware they ought to be, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined her father, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nthey--ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, the gridiron was put in requisition, and the good-tempered cherub,\r\nwho was often as un-cherubically employed in his own family as if he had\r\nbeen in the employment of some of the Old Masters, undertook to grill\r\nthe fowls. Indeed, except in respect of staring about him (a branch of\r\nthe public service to which the pictorial cherub is much addicted), this\r\ndomestic cherub discharged as many odd functions as his prototype; with\r\nthe difference, say, that he performed with a blacking-brush on the\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s boots, instead of performing on enormous wind instruments and\r\ndouble-basses, and that he conducted himself with cheerful alacrity to\r\nmuch useful purpose, instead of foreshortening himself in the air with\r\nthe vaguest intentions.\r\n\r\nBella helped him with his supplemental cookery, and made him very happy,\r\nbut put him in mortal terror too by asking him when they sat down at\r\ntable again, how he supposed they cooked fowls at the Greenwich dinners,\r\nand whether he believed they really were such pleasant dinners as people\r\nsaid? His secret winks and nods of remonstrance, in reply, made the\r\nmischievous Bella laugh until she choked, and then Lavinia was obliged\r\nto slap her on the back, and then she laughed the more.\r\n\r\nBut her mother was a fine corrective at the other end of the table; to\r\nwhom her father, in the innocence of his good-fellowship, at intervals\r\nappealed with: \xe2\x80\x98My dear, I am afraid you are not enjoying yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why so, R. W.?\xe2\x80\x99 she would sonorously reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, my dear, you seem a little out of sorts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 would be the rejoinder, in exactly the same tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you take a merry-thought, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. I will take whatever you please, R. W.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, but my dear, do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like it as well as I like anything, R. W.\xe2\x80\x99 The stately woman would\r\nthen, with a meritorious appearance of devoting herself to the general\r\ngood, pursue her dinner as if she were feeding somebody else on high\r\npublic grounds.\r\n\r\nBella had brought dessert and two bottles of wine, thus shedding\r\nunprecedented splendour on the occasion. Mrs Wilfer did the honours of\r\nthe first glass by proclaiming: \xe2\x80\x98R. W. I drink to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, my dear. And I to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa and Ma!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Permit me,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer interposed, with outstretched glove. \xe2\x80\x98No. I\r\nthink not. I drank to your papa. If, however, you insist on including\r\nme, I can in gratitude offer no objection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Lor, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Lavvy the bold, \xe2\x80\x98isn\xe2\x80\x99t it the day that made\r\nyou and Pa one and the same? I have no patience!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By whatever other circumstance the day may be marked, it is not the\r\nday, Lavinia, on which I will allow a child of mine to pounce upon me.\r\nI beg--nay, command!--that you will not pounce. R. W., it is appropriate\r\nto recall that it is for you to command and for me to obey. It is your\r\nhouse, and you are master at your own table. Both our healths!\xe2\x80\x99 Drinking\r\nthe toast with tremendous stiffness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really am a little afraid, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 hinted the cherub meekly, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nyou are not enjoying yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the contrary,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98quite so. Why should I not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought, my dear, that perhaps your face might--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My face might be a martyrdom, but what would that import, or who should\r\nknow it, if I smiled?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she did smile; manifestly freezing the blood of Mr George Sampson\r\nby so doing. For that young gentleman, catching her smiling eye, was so\r\nvery much appalled by its expression as to cast about in his thoughts\r\nconcerning what he had done to bring it down upon himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The mind naturally falls,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98shall I say into a\r\nreverie, or shall I say into a retrospect? on a day like this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLavvy, sitting with defiantly folded arms, replied (but not audibly),\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake say whichever of the two you like best, Ma, and get\r\nit over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The mind,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mrs Wilfer in an oratorical manner, \xe2\x80\x98naturally\r\nreverts to Papa and Mamma--I here allude to my parents--at a period\r\nbefore the earliest dawn of this day. I was considered tall; perhaps I\r\nwas. Papa and Mamma were unquestionably tall. I have rarely seen a finer\r\nwomen than my mother; never than my father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe irrepressible Lavvy remarked aloud, \xe2\x80\x98Whatever grandpapa was, he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t a female.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your grandpapa,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mrs Wilfer, with an awful look, and in an\r\nawful tone, \xe2\x80\x98was what I describe him to have been, and would have struck\r\nany of his grandchildren to the earth who presumed to question it. It\r\nwas one of mamma\xe2\x80\x99s cherished hopes that I should become united to a\r\ntall member of society. It may have been a weakness, but if so, it was\r\nequally the weakness, I believe, of King Frederick of Prussia.\xe2\x80\x99 These\r\nremarks being offered to Mr George Sampson, who had not the courage to\r\ncome out for single combat, but lurked with his chest under the table\r\nand his eyes cast down, Mrs Wilfer proceeded, in a voice of increasing\r\nsternness and impressiveness, until she should force that skulker\r\nto give himself up. \xe2\x80\x98Mamma would appear to have had an indefinable\r\nforeboding of what afterwards happened, for she would frequently urge\r\nupon me, \xe2\x80\x9cNot a little man. Promise me, my child, not a little man.\r\nNever, never, never, marry a little man!\xe2\x80\x9d Papa also would remark to me\r\n(he possessed extraordinary humour), \xe2\x80\x9cthat a family of whales must not\r\nally themselves with sprats.\xe2\x80\x9d His company was eagerly sought, as may\r\nbe supposed, by the wits of the day, and our house was their continual\r\nresort. I have known as many as three copper-plate engravers exchanging\r\nthe most exquisite sallies and retorts there, at one time.\xe2\x80\x99 (Here Mr\r\nSampson delivered himself captive, and said, with an uneasy movement on\r\nhis chair, that three was a large number, and it must have been highly\r\nentertaining.) \xe2\x80\x98Among the most prominent members of that distinguished\r\ncircle, was a gentleman measuring six feet four in height. HE was NOT\r\nan engraver.\xe2\x80\x99 (Here Mr Sampson said, with no reason whatever, Of course\r\nnot.) \xe2\x80\x98This gentleman was so obliging as to honour me with attentions\r\nwhich I could not fail to understand.\xe2\x80\x99 (Here Mr Sampson murmured that\r\nwhen it came to that, you could always tell.) \xe2\x80\x98I immediately announced\r\nto both my parents that those attentions were misplaced, and that I\r\ncould not favour his suit. They inquired was he too tall? I replied it\r\nwas not the stature, but the intellect was too lofty. At our house,\r\nI said, the tone was too brilliant, the pressure was too high, to be\r\nmaintained by me, a mere woman, in every-day domestic life. I well\r\nremember mamma\xe2\x80\x99s clasping her hands, and exclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cThis will end in\r\na little man!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 (Here Mr Sampson glanced at his host and shook his head\r\nwith despondency.) \xe2\x80\x98She afterwards went so far as to predict that it\r\nwould end in a little man whose mind would be below the average, but\r\nthat was in what I may denominate a paroxysm of maternal disappointment.\r\nWithin a month,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, deepening her voice, as if she were\r\nrelating a terrible ghost story, \xe2\x80\x98within a-month, I first saw R. W. my\r\nhusband. Within a year, I married him. It is natural for the mind to\r\nrecall these dark coincidences on the present day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson at length released from the custody of Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s eye, now\r\ndrew a long breath, and made the original and striking remark that there\r\nwas no accounting for these sort of presentiments. R. W. scratched his\r\nhead and looked apologetically all round the table until he came to his\r\nwife, when observing her as it were shrouded in a more sombre veil than\r\nbefore, he once more hinted, \xe2\x80\x98My dear, I am really afraid you are not\r\naltogether enjoying yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 To which she once more replied, \xe2\x80\x98On the\r\ncontrary, R. W. Quite so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wretched Mr Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s position at this agreeable entertainment\r\nwas truly pitiable. For, not only was he exposed defenceless to the\r\nharangues of Mrs Wilfer, but he received the utmost contumely at the\r\nhands of Lavinia; who, partly to show Bella that she (Lavinia) could do\r\nwhat she liked with him, and partly to pay him off for still obviously\r\nadmiring Bella\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, led him the life of a dog. Illuminated on the\r\none hand by the stately graces of Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s oratory, and shadowed\r\non the other by the checks and frowns of the young lady to whom he\r\nhad devoted himself in his destitution, the sufferings of this young\r\ngentleman were distressing to witness. If his mind for the moment reeled\r\nunder them, it may be urged, in extenuation of its weakness, that it\r\nwas constitutionally a knock-knee\xe2\x80\x99d mind and never very strong upon its\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThe rosy hours were thus beguiled until it was time for Bella to have\r\nPa\xe2\x80\x99s escort back. The dimples duly tied up in the bonnet-strings and the\r\nleave-taking done, they got out into the air, and the cherub drew a long\r\nbreath as if he found it refreshing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, dear Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98the anniversary may be considered over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the cherub, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s another of \xe2\x80\x98em gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella drew his arm closer through hers as they walked along, and gave it\r\na number of consolatory pats. \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as if\r\nshe had spoken; \xe2\x80\x98I am all right, my dear. Well, and how do you get on,\r\nBella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not at all improved, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you really though?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa. On the contrary, I am worse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lor!\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am worse, Pa. I make so many calculations how much a year I must have\r\nwhen I marry, and what is the least I can manage to do with, that I am\r\nbeginning to get wrinkles over my nose. Did you notice any wrinkles over\r\nmy nose this evening, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPa laughing at this, Bella gave him two or three shakes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, sir, when you see your lovely woman turning haggard.\r\nYou had better be prepared in time, I can tell you. I shall not be able\r\nto keep my greediness for money out of my eyes long, and when you see it\r\nthere you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry, and serve you right for not being warned in time.\r\nNow, sir, we entered into a bond of confidence. Have you anything to\r\nimpart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it was you who was to impart, my love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! did you indeed, sir? Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me, the moment we came\r\nout? The confidences of lovely women are not to be slighted. However, I\r\nforgive you this once, and look here, Pa; that\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99--Bella laid the\r\nlittle forefinger of her right glove on her lip, and then laid it on her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s lip--\xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s a kiss for you. And now I am going seriously\r\nto tell you--let me see how many--four secrets. Mind! Serious, grave,\r\nweighty secrets. Strictly between ourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number one, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, settling her arm comfortably and\r\nconfidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98will electrify you, Pa. Who do you think\r\nhas\xe2\x80\x99--she was confused here in spite of her merry way of beginning \xe2\x80\x98has\r\nmade an offer to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPa looked in her face, and looked at the ground, and looked in her face\r\nagain, and declared he could never guess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me so, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mis--ter Roke--smith, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella separating the syllables for\r\nemphasis. \xe2\x80\x98What do you say to THAT?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPa answered quietly with the counter-question, \xe2\x80\x98What did YOU say to\r\nthat, my love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said No,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella sharply. \xe2\x80\x98Of course.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, meditating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I told him why I thought it a betrayal of trust on his part, and an\r\naffront to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. To be sure. I am astonished indeed. I wonder he committed himself\r\nwithout seeing more of his way first. Now I think of it, I suspect he\r\nalways has admired you though, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hackney coachman may admire me,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Bella, with a touch of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s loftiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s highly probable, my love. Number two, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number two, Pa, is much to the same purpose, though not so\r\npreposterous. Mr Lightwood would propose to me, if I would let him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I understand, my dear, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to let him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella again saying, with her former emphasis, \xe2\x80\x98Why, of course not!\xe2\x80\x99 her\r\nfather felt himself bound to echo, \xe2\x80\x98Of course not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s enough,\xe2\x80\x99 her father interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa, it\xe2\x80\x99s NOT enough,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bella, giving him another shake or\r\ntwo. \xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you what a mercenary little wretch I am? It\r\nonly becomes enough when he has no money, and no clients, and no\r\nexpectations, and no anything but debts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub, a little depressed. \xe2\x80\x98Number three, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Number three, Pa, is a better thing. A generous thing, a noble thing, a\r\ndelightful thing. Mrs Boffin has herself told me, as a secret, with her\r\nown kind lips--and truer lips never opened or closed in this life, I am\r\nsure--that they wish to see me well married; and that when I marry with\r\ntheir consent they will portion me most handsomely.\xe2\x80\x99 Here the grateful\r\ngirl burst out crying very heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, my darling,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, with his hand to his eyes;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s excusable in me to be a little overcome when I find that my dear\r\nfavourite child is, after all disappointments, to be so provided for\r\nand so raised in the world; but don\xe2\x80\x99t YOU cry, don\xe2\x80\x99t YOU cry. I am very\r\nthankful. I congratulate you with all my heart, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99 The good soft\r\nlittle fellow, drying his eyes, here, Bella put her arms round his neck\r\nand tenderly kissed him on the high road, passionately telling him\r\nhe was the best of fathers and the best of friends, and that on her\r\nwedding-morning she would go down on her knees to him and beg his pardon\r\nfor having ever teased him or seemed insensible to the worth of such\r\na patient, sympathetic, genial, fresh young heart. At every one of her\r\nadjectives she redoubled her kisses, and finally kissed his hat off, and\r\nthen laughed immoderately when the wind took it and he ran after it.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered his hat and his breath, and they were going on\r\nagain once more, said her father then: \xe2\x80\x98Number four, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s countenance fell in the midst of her mirth. \xe2\x80\x98After all, perhaps\r\nI had better put off number four, Pa. Let me try once more, if for never\r\nso short a time, to hope that it may not really be so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe change in her, strengthened the cherub\xe2\x80\x99s interest in number four,\r\nand he said quietly: \xe2\x80\x98May not be so, my dear? May not be how, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella looked at him pensively, and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet I know right well it is so, Pa. I know it only too well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her father, \xe2\x80\x98you make me quite uncomfortable. Have\r\nyou said No to anybody else, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes to anybody?\xe2\x80\x99 he suggested, lifting up his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there anybody else who would take his chance between Yes and No, if\r\nyou would let him, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I know of, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There can\xe2\x80\x99t be somebody who won\xe2\x80\x99t take his chance when you want him\r\nto?\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub, as a last resource.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, of course not, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, giving him another shake or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, of course not,\xe2\x80\x99 he assented. \xe2\x80\x98Bella, my dear, I am afraid I must\r\neither have no sleep to-night, or I must press for number four.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Pa, there is no good in number four! I am so sorry for it, I am so\r\nunwilling to believe it, I have tried so earnestly not to see it, that\r\nit is very hard to tell, even to you. But Mr Boffin is being spoilt by\r\nprosperity, and is changing every day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Bella, I hope and trust not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have hoped and trusted not too, Pa; but every day he changes for\r\nthe worse, and for the worse. Not to me--he is always much the same\r\nto me--but to others about him. Before my eyes he grows suspicious,\r\ncapricious, hard, tyrannical, unjust. If ever a good man were ruined by\r\ngood fortune, it is my benefactor. And yet, Pa, think how terrible the\r\nfascination of money is! I see this, and hate this, and dread this, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know but that money might make a much worse change in me. And yet\r\nI have money always in my thoughts and my desires; and the whole life I\r\nplace before myself is money, money, money, and what money can make of\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO BAD COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nWere Bella Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s bright and ready little wits at fault, or was the\r\nGolden Dustman passing through the furnace of proof and coming out\r\ndross? Ill news travels fast. We shall know full soon.\r\n\r\nOn that very night of her return from the Happy Return, something\r\nchanced which Bella closely followed with her eyes and ears. There was\r\nan apartment at the side of the Boffin mansion, known as Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. Far less grand than the rest of the house, it was far more\r\ncomfortable, being pervaded by a certain air of homely snugness, which\r\nupholstering despotism had banished to that spot when it inexorably set\r\nits face against Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s appeals for mercy in behalf of any other\r\nchamber. Thus, although a room of modest situation--for its windows gave\r\non Silas Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s old corner--and of no pretensions to velvet, satin, or\r\ngilding, it had got itself established in a domestic position analogous\r\nto that of an easy dressing-gown or pair of slippers; and whenever the\r\nfamily wanted to enjoy a particularly pleasant fireside evening, they\r\nenjoyed it, as an institution that must be, in Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin were reported sitting in this room, when Bella got\r\nback. Entering it, she found the Secretary there too; in official\r\nattendance it would appear, for he was standing with some papers in his\r\nhand by a table with shaded candles on it, at which Mr Boffin was seated\r\nthrown back in his easy chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are busy, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, hesitating at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, my dear, not at all. You\xe2\x80\x99re one of ourselves. We never\r\nmake company of you. Come in, come in. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the old lady in her usual\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin adding her nod and smile of welcome to Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s words,\r\nBella took her book to a chair in the fireside corner, by Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork-table. Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s station was on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Golden Dustman, so sharply rapping the table\r\nto bespeak his attention as Bella turned the leaves of her book, that\r\nshe started; \xe2\x80\x98where were we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were saying, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary, with an air of some\r\nreluctance and a glance towards those others who were present, \xe2\x80\x98that you\r\nconsidered the time had come for fixing my salary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be above calling it wages, man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, testily. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nthe deuce! I never talked of any salary when I was in service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My wages,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, correcting himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rokesmith, you are not proud, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 observed Mr Boffin, eyeing him\r\naskance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I never was, when I was poor,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Poverty and\r\npride don\xe2\x80\x99t go at all well together. Mind that. How can they go well\r\ntogether? Why it stands to reason. A man, being poor, has nothing to be\r\nproud of. It\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a slight inclination of his head, and a look of some surprise,\r\nthe Secretary seemed to assent by forming the syllables of the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x98nonsense\xe2\x80\x99 on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, concerning these same wages,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Sit down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down before?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, distrustfully. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhope that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pride? But about these wages. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone into the\r\nmatter, and I say two hundred a year. What do you think of it? Do you\r\nthink it\xe2\x80\x99s enough?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. It is a fair proposal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t say, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin stipulated, \xe2\x80\x98but what it may be more\r\nthan enough. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why, Rokesmith. A man of property, like\r\nme, is bound to consider the market-price. At first I didn\xe2\x80\x99t enter into\r\nthat as much as I might have done; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got acquainted with other\r\nmen of property since, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got acquainted with the duties of\r\nproperty. I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go putting the market-price up, because money may\r\nhappen not to be an object with me. A sheep is worth so much in the\r\nmarket, and I ought to give it and no more. A secretary is worth so much\r\nin the market, and I ought to give it and no more. However, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nstretching a point with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, you are very good,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the Secretary, with an effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then we put the figure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98at two hundred a year.\r\nThen the figure\xe2\x80\x99s disposed of. Now, there must be no misunderstanding\r\nregarding what I buy for two hundred a year. If I pay for a sheep, I buy\r\nit out and out. Similarly, if I pay for a secretary, I buy HIM out and\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In other words, you purchase my whole time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly I do. Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98it ain\xe2\x80\x99t that I want to\r\noccupy your whole time; you can take up a book for a minute or two when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing better to do, though I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll a\xe2\x80\x99most always find\r\nsomething useful to do. But I want to keep you in attendance. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconvenient to have you at all times ready on the premises. Therefore,\r\nbetwixt your breakfast and your supper,--on the premises I expect to\r\nfind you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary bowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In bygone days, when I was in service myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go cutting about at my will and pleasure, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nto go cutting about at your will and pleasure. You\xe2\x80\x99ve rather got into\r\na habit of that, lately; but perhaps it was for want of a right\r\nspecification betwixt us. Now, let there be a right specification\r\nbetwixt us, and let it be this. If you want leave, ask for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain the Secretary bowed. His manner was uneasy and astonished, and\r\nshowed a sense of humiliation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98hung from this room to yours,\r\nand when I want you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll touch it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind that I have\r\nanything more to say at the present moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary rose, gathered up his papers, and withdrew. Bella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nfollowed him to the door, lighted on Mr Boffin complacently thrown back\r\nin his easy chair, and drooped over her book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have let that chap, that young man of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, taking a\r\ntrot up and down the room, \xe2\x80\x98get above his work. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I must have\r\nhim down a peg. A man of property owes a duty to other men of property,\r\nand must look sharp after his inferiors.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella felt that Mrs Boffin was not comfortable, and that the eyes of\r\nthat good creature sought to discover from her face what attention she\r\nhad given to this discourse, and what impression it had made upon her.\r\nFor which reason Bella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes drooped more engrossedly over her book,\r\nand she turned the page with an air of profound absorption in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noddy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, after thoughtfully pausing in her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Golden Dustman, stopping short in his trot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excuse my putting it to you, Noddy, but now really! Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been\r\na little strict with Mr Rokesmith to-night? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been a\r\nlittle--just a little little--not quite like your old self?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, old woman, I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, cheerfully, if not\r\nboastfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hope so, deary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our old selves wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do here, old lady. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you found that out\r\nyet? Our old selves would be fit for nothing here but to be robbed and\r\nimposed upon. Our old selves weren\xe2\x80\x99t people of fortune; our new selves\r\nare; it\xe2\x80\x99s a great difference.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, pausing in her work again, softly to draw a long\r\nbreath and to look at the fire. \xe2\x80\x98A great difference.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And we must be up to the difference,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued her husband; \xe2\x80\x98we must be\r\nequal to the change; that\xe2\x80\x99s what we must be. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hold our own\r\nnow, against everybody (for everybody\xe2\x80\x99s hand is stretched out to be\r\ndipped into our pockets), and we have got to recollect that money makes\r\nmoney, as well as makes everything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mentioning recollecting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, with her work abandoned,\r\nher eyes upon the fire, and her chin upon her hand, \xe2\x80\x98do you recollect,\r\nNoddy, how you said to Mr Rokesmith when he first came to see us at the\r\nBower, and you engaged him--how you said to him that if it had pleased\r\nHeaven to send John Harmon to his fortune safe, we could have been\r\ncontent with the one Mound which was our legacy, and should never have\r\nwanted the rest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, I remember, old lady. But we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t tried what it was to have the\r\nrest then. Our new shoes had come home, but we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t put \xe2\x80\x98em on. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwearing \xe2\x80\x98em now, we\xe2\x80\x99re wearing \xe2\x80\x98em, and must step out accordingly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin took up her work again, and plied her needle in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to Rokesmith, that young man of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, dropping\r\nhis voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being\r\noverheard by some eavesdropper there, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with him as with\r\nthe footmen. I have found out that you must either scrunch them, or let\r\nthem scrunch you. If you ain\xe2\x80\x99t imperious with \xe2\x80\x98em, they won\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nin your being any better than themselves, if as good, after the stories\r\n(lies mostly) that they have heard of your beginnings. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nbetwixt stiffening yourself up, and throwing yourself away; take my word\r\nfor that, old lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella ventured for a moment to look stealthily towards him under her\r\neyelashes, and she saw a dark cloud of suspicion, covetousness, and\r\nconceit, overshadowing the once open face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98this isn\xe2\x80\x99t entertaining to Miss Bella. Is it,\r\nBella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA deceiving Bella she was, to look at him with that pensively abstracted\r\nair, as if her mind were full of her book, and she had not heard a\r\nsingle word!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hah! Better employed than to attend to it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Especially as you have no call to be told how to\r\nvalue yourself, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nColouring a little under this compliment, Bella returned, \xe2\x80\x98I hope sir,\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t think me vain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very creditable\r\nin you, at your age, to be so well up with the pace of the world, and to\r\nknow what to go in for. You are right. Go in for money, my love. Money\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe article. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make money of your good looks, and of the money Mrs\r\nBoffin and me will have the pleasure of settling upon you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlive and die rich. That\xe2\x80\x99s the state to live and die in!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin,\r\nin an unctuous manner. \xe2\x80\x98R--r--rich!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an expression of distress in Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face, as, after\r\nwatching her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, she turned to their adopted girl, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind him, Bella, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98What! Not mind him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, with a worried look, \xe2\x80\x98but I mean,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe him to be anything but good and generous, Bella, because\r\nhe is the best of men. No, I must say that much, Noddy. You are always\r\nthe best of men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe made the declaration as if he were objecting to it: which assuredly\r\nhe was not in any way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as to you, my dear Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, still with that\r\ndistressed expression, \xe2\x80\x98he is so much attached to you, whatever he says,\r\nthat your own father has not a truer interest in you and can hardly like\r\nyou better than he does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Says too!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Whatever he says! Why, I say so, openly.\r\nGive me a kiss, my dear child, in saying Good Night, and let me confirm\r\nwhat my old lady tells you. I am very fond of you, my dear, and I am\r\nentirely of your mind, and you and I will take care that you shall be\r\nrich. These good looks of yours (which you have some right to be vain\r\nof; my dear, though you are not, you know) are worth money, and you\r\nshall make money of \xe2\x80\x98em. The money you will have, will be worth money,\r\nand you shall make money of that too. There\xe2\x80\x99s a golden ball at your\r\nfeet. Good night, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow, Bella was not so well pleased with this assurance and this\r\nprospect as she might have been. Somehow, when she put her arms\r\nround Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s neck and said Good Night, she derived a sense of\r\nunworthiness from the still anxious face of that good woman and her\r\nobvious wish to excuse her husband. \xe2\x80\x98Why, what need to excuse him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought Bella, sitting down in her own room. \xe2\x80\x98What he said was very\r\nsensible, I am sure, and very true, I am sure. It is only what I often\r\nsay to myself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I like it then? No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, and, though\r\nhe is my liberal benefactor, I disparage him for it. Then pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella, sternly putting the question to herself in the looking-glass as\r\nusual, \xe2\x80\x98what do you mean by this, you inconsistent little Beast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe looking-glass preserving a discreet ministerial silence when thus\r\ncalled upon for explanation, Bella went to bed with a weariness upon her\r\nspirit which was more than the weariness of want of sleep. And again\r\nin the morning, she looked for the cloud, and for the deepening of the\r\ncloud, upon the Golden Dustman\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\nShe had begun by this time to be his frequent companion in his morning\r\nstrolls about the streets, and it was at this time that he made her a\r\nparty to his engaging in a curious pursuit. Having been hard at work in\r\none dull enclosure all his life, he had a child\xe2\x80\x99s delight in looking\r\nat shops. It had been one of the first novelties and pleasures of his\r\nfreedom, and was equally the delight of his wife. For many years their\r\nonly walks in London had been taken on Sundays when the shops were shut;\r\nand when every day in the week became their holiday, they derived an\r\nenjoyment from the variety and fancy and beauty of the display in the\r\nwindows, which seemed incapable of exhaustion. As if the principal\r\nstreets were a great Theatre and the play were childishly new to them,\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin, from the beginning of Bella\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy in their\r\nhouse, had been constantly in the front row, charmed with all they saw\r\nand applauding vigorously. But now, Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s interest began to centre\r\nin book-shops; and more than that--for that of itself would not have\r\nbeen much--in one exceptional kind of book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look in here, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin would say, checking Bella\xe2\x80\x99s arm at a\r\nbookseller\xe2\x80\x99s window; \xe2\x80\x98you can read at sight, and your eyes are as sharp\r\nas they\xe2\x80\x99re bright. Now, look well about you, my dear, and tell me if you\r\nsee any book about a Miser.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf Bella saw such a book, Mr Boffin would instantly dart in and buy\r\nit. And still, as if they had not found it, they would seek out another\r\nbook-shop, and Mr Boffin would say, \xe2\x80\x98Now, look well all round, my\r\ndear, for a Life of a Miser, or any book of that sort; any Lives of odd\r\ncharacters who may have been Misers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella, thus directed, would examine the window with the greatest\r\nattention, while Mr Boffin would examine her face. The moment she\r\npointed out any book as being entitled Lives of eccentric personages,\r\nAnecdotes of strange characters, Records of remarkable individuals, or\r\nanything to that purpose, Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s countenance would light up, and\r\nhe would instantly dart in and buy it. Size, price, quality, were of no\r\naccount. Any book that seemed to promise a chance of miserly biography,\r\nMr Boffin purchased without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay and carried home. Happening\r\nto be informed by a bookseller that a portion of the Annual Register was\r\ndevoted to \xe2\x80\x98Characters\xe2\x80\x99, Mr Boffin at once bought a whole set of that\r\ningenious compilation, and began to carry it home piecemeal, confiding\r\na volume to Bella, and bearing three himself. The completion of this\r\nlabour occupied them about a fortnight. When the task was done, Mr\r\nBoffin, with his appetite for Misers whetted instead of satiated, began\r\nto look out again.\r\n\r\nIt very soon became unnecessary to tell Bella what to look for, and an\r\nunderstanding was established between her and Mr Boffin that she was\r\nalways to look for Lives of Misers. Morning after morning they roamed\r\nabout the town together, pursuing this singular research. Miserly\r\nliterature not being abundant, the proportion of failures to successes\r\nmay have been as a hundred to one; still Mr Boffin, never wearied,\r\nremained as avaricious for misers as he had been at the first onset. It\r\nwas curious that Bella never saw the books about the house, nor did she\r\never hear from Mr Boffin one word of reference to their contents. He\r\nseemed to save up his Misers as they had saved up their money. As they\r\nhad been greedy for it, and secret about it, and had hidden it, so he\r\nwas greedy for them, and secret about them, and hid them. But beyond all\r\ndoubt it was to be noticed, and was by Bella very clearly noticed, that,\r\nas he pursued the acquisition of those dismal records with the ardour of\r\nDon Quixote for his books of chivalry, he began to spend his money with\r\na more sparing hand. And often when he came out of a shop with some new\r\naccount of one of those wretched lunatics, she would almost shrink from\r\nthe sly dry chuckle with which he would take her arm again and trot\r\naway. It did not appear that Mrs Boffin knew of this taste. He made\r\nno allusion to it, except in the morning walks when he and Bella were\r\nalways alone; and Bella, partly under the impression that he took her\r\ninto his confidence by implication, and partly in remembrance of Mrs\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s anxious face that night, held the same reserve.\r\n\r\nWhile these occurrences were in progress, Mrs Lammle made the discovery\r\nthat Bella had a fascinating influence over her. The Lammles, originally\r\npresented by the dear Veneerings, visited the Boffins on all grand\r\noccasions, and Mrs Lammle had not previously found this out; but now the\r\nknowledge came upon her all at once. It was a most extraordinary thing\r\n(she said to Mrs Boffin); she was foolishly susceptible of the power of\r\nbeauty, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether that; she never had been able to resist\r\na natural grace of manner, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether that; it was more\r\nthan that, and there was no name for the indescribable extent and degree\r\nto which she was captivated by this charming girl.\r\n\r\nThis charming girl having the words repeated to her by Mrs Boffin (who\r\nwas proud of her being admired, and would have done anything to give her\r\npleasure), naturally recognized in Mrs Lammle a woman of penetration\r\nand taste. Responding to the sentiments, by being very gracious to Mrs\r\nLammle, she gave that lady the means of so improving her opportunity,\r\nas that the captivation became reciprocal, though always wearing an\r\nappearance of greater sobriety on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s part than on the enthusiastic\r\nSophronia\xe2\x80\x99s. Howbeit, they were so much together that, for a time, the\r\nBoffin chariot held Mrs Lammle oftener than Mrs Boffin: a preference\r\nof which the latter worthy soul was not in the least jealous, placidly\r\nremarking, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs Lammle is a younger companion for her than I am, and\r\nLor! she\xe2\x80\x99s more fashionable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut between Bella Wilfer and Georgiana Podsnap there was this one\r\ndifference, among many others, that Bella was in no danger of being\r\ncaptivated by Alfred. She distrusted and disliked him. Indeed, her\r\nperception was so quick, and her observation so sharp, that after all\r\nshe mistrusted his wife too, though with her giddy vanity and wilfulness\r\nshe squeezed the mistrust away into a corner of her mind, and blocked it\r\nup there.\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle took the friendliest interest in Bella\xe2\x80\x99s making a good match.\r\nMrs Lammle said, in a sportive way, she really must show her beautiful\r\nBella what kind of wealthy creatures she and Alfred had on hand, who\r\nwould as one man fall at her feet enslaved. Fitting occasion made,\r\nMrs Lammle accordingly produced the most passable of those feverish,\r\nboastful, and indefinably loose gentlemen who were always lounging in\r\nand out of the City on questions of the Bourse and Greek and Spanish and\r\nIndia and Mexican and par and premium and discount and three-quarters\r\nand seven-eighths. Who in their agreeable manner did homage to Bella\r\nas if she were a compound of fine girl, thorough-bred horse, well-built\r\ndrag, and remarkable pipe. But without the least effect, though even Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s attractions were cast into the scale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear, Bella dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle one day in the chariot, \xe2\x80\x98that you\r\nwill be very hard to please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be pleased, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with a languid turn of\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Sophronia, shaking her head, and smiling\r\nher best smile, \xe2\x80\x98it would not be very easy to find a man worthy of your\r\nattractions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The question is not a man, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, coolly, \xe2\x80\x98but an\r\nestablishment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98your prudence amazes me--where DID you\r\nstudy life so well!--you are right. In such a case as yours, the object\r\nis a fitting establishment. You could not descend to an inadequate one\r\nfrom Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house, and even if your beauty alone could not command\r\nit, it is to be assumed that Mr and Mrs Boffin will--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! they have already,\xe2\x80\x99 Bella interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! Have they really?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little vexed by a suspicion that she had spoken precipitately, and\r\nwithal a little defiant of her own vexation, Bella determined not to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is to say,\xe2\x80\x99 she explained, \xe2\x80\x98they have told me they mean to portion\r\nme as their adopted child, if you mean that. But don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mention it!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mrs Lammle, as if she were full of awakened\r\nfeeling at the suggestion of such an impossibility. \xe2\x80\x98Men-tion it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you, Mrs Lammle--\xe2\x80\x99 Bella began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love, say Sophronia, or I must not say Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a little short, petulant \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 Bella complied. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!--Sophronia\r\nthen--I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you, Sophronia, that I am convinced I have\r\nno heart, as people call it; and that I think that sort of thing is\r\nnonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brave girl!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Mrs Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bella, \xe2\x80\x98as to seeking to please myself, I don\xe2\x80\x99t;\r\nexcept in the one respect I have mentioned. I am indifferent otherwise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you can\xe2\x80\x99t help pleasing, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, rallying her with\r\nan arch look and her best smile, \xe2\x80\x98you can\xe2\x80\x99t help making a proud and an\r\nadmiring husband. You may not care to please yourself, and you may not\r\ncare to please him, but you are not a free agent as to pleasing: you\r\nare forced to do that, in spite of yourself, my dear; so it may be a\r\nquestion whether you may not as well please yourself too, if you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow, the very grossness of this flattery put Bella upon proving that she\r\nactually did please in spite of herself. She had a misgiving that she\r\nwas doing wrong--though she had an indistinct foreshadowing that some\r\nharm might come of it thereafter, she little thought what consequences\r\nit would really bring about--but she went on with her confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of pleasing in spite of one\xe2\x80\x99s self, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave had enough of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98Am I already corroborated, Bella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, Sophronia, we will not speak of it any more. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis plainly meaning Do ask me about it, Mrs Lammle did as she was\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, Bella. Come, my dear. What provoking burr has been\r\ninconveniently attracted to the charming skirts, and with difficulty\r\nshaken off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Provoking indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98and no burr to boast of! But don\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I guess?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would never guess. What would you say to our Secretary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear! The hermit Secretary, who creeps up and down the back stairs,\r\nand is never seen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about his creeping up and down the back stairs,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella, rather contemptuously, \xe2\x80\x98further than knowing that he does no such\r\nthing; and as to his never being seen, I should be content never to have\r\nseen him, though he is quite as visible as you are. But I pleased HIM\r\n(for my sins) and he had the presumption to tell me so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man never made a declaration to you, my dear Bella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure of that, Sophronia?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I am not. In fact, I am\r\nsure of the contrary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The man must be mad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, with a kind of resignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He appeared to be in his senses,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, tossing her head,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and he had plenty to say for himself. I told him my opinion of his\r\ndeclaration and his conduct, and dismissed him. Of course this has all\r\nbeen very inconvenient to me, and very disagreeable. It has remained a\r\nsecret, however. That word reminds me to observe, Sophronia, that I have\r\nglided on into telling you the secret, and that I rely upon you never to\r\nmention it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mention it!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Lammle with her former feeling. \xe2\x80\x98Men-tion\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis time Sophronia was so much in earnest that she found it necessary\r\nto bend forward in the carriage and give Bella a kiss. A Judas order of\r\nkiss; for she thought, while she yet pressed Bella\xe2\x80\x99s hand after giving\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x98Upon your own showing, you vain heartless girl, puffed up by the\r\ndoting folly of a dustman, I need have no relenting towards YOU. If my\r\nhusband, who sends me here, should form any schemes for making YOU a\r\nvictim, I should certainly not cross him again.\xe2\x80\x99 In those very same\r\nmoments, Bella was thinking, \xe2\x80\x98Why am I always at war with myself? Why\r\nhave I told, as if upon compulsion, what I knew all along I ought to\r\nhave withheld? Why am I making a friend of this woman beside me, in\r\nspite of the whispers against her that I hear in my heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs usual, there was no answer in the looking-glass when she got home and\r\nreferred these questions to it. Perhaps if she had consulted some better\r\noracle, the result might have been more satisfactory; but she did not,\r\nand all things consequent marched the march before them.\r\n\r\nOn one point connected with the watch she kept on Mr Boffin, she felt\r\nvery inquisitive, and that was the question whether the Secretary\r\nwatched him too, and followed the sure and steady change in him, as she\r\ndid? Her very limited intercourse with Mr Rokesmith rendered this hard\r\nto find out. Their communication now, at no time extended beyond the\r\npreservation of commonplace appearances before Mr and Mrs Boffin; and if\r\nBella and the Secretary were ever left alone together by any chance,\r\nhe immediately withdrew. She consulted his face when she could do so\r\ncovertly, as she worked or read, and could make nothing of it. He looked\r\nsubdued; but he had acquired a strong command of feature, and, whenever\r\nMr Boffin spoke to him in Bella\xe2\x80\x99s presence, or whatever revelation of\r\nhimself Mr Boffin made, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s face changed no more than a\r\nwall. A slightly knitted brow, that expressed nothing but an almost\r\nmechanical attention, and a compression of the mouth, that might have\r\nbeen a guard against a scornful smile--these she saw from morning to\r\nnight, from day to day, from week to week, monotonous, unvarying, set,\r\nas in a piece of sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe worst of the matter was, that it thus fell out insensibly--and most\r\nprovokingly, as Bella complained to herself, in her impetuous little\r\nmanner--that her observation of Mr Boffin involved a continual\r\nobservation of Mr Rokesmith. \xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t THAT extract a look from him?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Can\r\nit be possible THAT makes no impression on him?\xe2\x80\x99 Such questions Bella\r\nwould propose to herself, often as many times in a day as there were\r\nhours in it. Impossible to know. Always the same fixed face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can he be so base as to sell his very nature for two hundred a year?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBella would think. And then, \xe2\x80\x98But why not? It\xe2\x80\x99s a mere question of price\r\nwith others besides him. I suppose I would sell mine, if I could get\r\nenough for it.\xe2\x80\x99 And so she would come round again to the war with\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nA kind of illegibility, though a different kind, stole over Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s face. Its old simplicity of expression got masked by a certain\r\ncraftiness that assimilated even his good-humour to itself. His very\r\nsmile was cunning, as if he had been studying smiles among the portraits\r\nof his misers. Saving an occasional burst of impatience, or coarse\r\nassertion of his mastery, his good-humour remained to him, but it had\r\nnow a sordid alloy of distrust; and though his eyes should twinkle and\r\nall his face should laugh, he would sit holding himself in his own\r\narms, as if he had an inclination to hoard himself up, and must always\r\ngrudgingly stand on the defensive.\r\n\r\nWhat with taking heed of these two faces, and what with feeling\r\nconscious that the stealthy occupation must set some mark on her own,\r\nBella soon began to think that there was not a candid or a natural face\r\namong them all but Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s. None the less because it was far less\r\nradiant than of yore, faithfully reflecting in its anxiety and regret\r\nevery line of change in the Golden Dustman\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin one evening when they were all in his room\r\nagain, and he and the Secretary had been going over some accounts, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam spending too much money. Or leastways, you are spending too much for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are rich, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nThe sharpness of the retort was next to telling the Secretary that he\r\nlied. But it brought no change of expression into the set face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you I am not rich,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not rich, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated the Secretary, in measured words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98if I am, that\xe2\x80\x99s my business. I am not going\r\nto spend at this rate, to please you, or anybody. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\r\nif it was your money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even in that impossible case, sir, I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98You oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to like it in any\r\ncase. There! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be rude, but you put me out so, and after\r\nall I\xe2\x80\x99m master. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to tell you to hold your tongue. I beg\r\nyour pardon. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold your tongue. Only, don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict. Did you\r\never come across the life of Mr Elwes?\xe2\x80\x99 referring to his favourite\r\nsubject at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The miser?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, people called him a miser. People are always calling other people\r\nsomething. Did you ever read about him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He never owned to being rich, and yet he might have bought me twice\r\nover. Did you ever hear of Daniel Dancer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another miser? Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was a good \xe2\x80\x98un,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and he had a sister worthy of him.\r\nThey never called themselves rich neither. If they HAD called themselves\r\nrich, most likely they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They lived and died very miserably. Did they not, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then they are not the Misers I mean. Those abject wretches--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call names, Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--That exemplary brother and sister--lived and died in the foulest and\r\nfilthiest degradation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They pleased themselves,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and I suppose they could\r\nhave done no more if they had spent their money. But however, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing to fling mine away. Keep the expenses down. The fact is, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nenough here, Rokesmith. It wants constant attention in the littlest\r\nthings. Some of us will be dying in a workhouse next.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the persons you have cited,\xe2\x80\x99 quietly remarked the Secretary,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98thought they would, if I remember, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And very creditable in \xe2\x80\x98em too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Very independent in\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em! But never mind them just now. Have you given notice to quit your\r\nlodgings?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Under your direction, I have, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I tell you what,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98pay the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s rent--pay the\r\nquarter\xe2\x80\x99s rent, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the cheapest thing in the end--and come here at\r\nonce, so that you may be always on the spot, day and night, and keep the\r\nexpenses down. You\xe2\x80\x99ll charge the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s rent to me, and we must try\r\nand save it somewhere. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got some lovely furniture; haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The furniture in my rooms is my own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then we shan\xe2\x80\x99t have to buy any for you. In case you was to think it,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mr Boffin, with a look of peculiar shrewdness, \xe2\x80\x98so honourably\r\nindependent in you as to make it a relief to your mind, to make that\r\nfurniture over to me in the light of a set-off against the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrent, why ease your mind, ease your mind. I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask it, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand in your way if you should consider it due to yourself. As to your\r\nroom, choose any empty room at the top of the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any empty room will do for me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can take your pick,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be as good as eight\r\nor ten shillings a week added to your income. I won\xe2\x80\x99t deduct for it; I\r\nlook to you to make it up handsomely by keeping the expenses down. Now,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll show a light, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to your office-room and dispose of a\r\nletter or two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn that clear, generous face of Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s, Bella had seen such traces\r\nof a pang at the heart while this dialogue was being held, that she\r\nhad not the courage to turn her eyes to it when they were left alone.\r\nFeigning to be intent on her embroidery, she sat plying her needle until\r\nher busy hand was stopped by Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s hand being lightly laid upon\r\nit. Yielding to the touch, she felt her hand carried to the good soul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips, and felt a tear fall on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my loved husband!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98This is hard to see and hear.\r\nBut my dear Bella, believe me that in spite of all the change in him, he\r\nis the best of men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe came back, at the moment when Bella had taken the hand comfortingly\r\nbetween her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, mistrustfully looking in at the door. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s she telling\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is only praising you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Praising me? You are sure? Not blaming me for standing on my own\r\ndefence against a crew of plunderers, who could suck me dry by driblets?\r\nNot blaming me for getting a little hoard together?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe came up to them, and his wife folded her hands upon his shoulder, and\r\nshook her head as she laid it on her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there, there!\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Boffin, not unkindly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t take on,\r\nold lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see you so, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense! Recollect we are not our old selves. Recollect, we must\r\nscrunch or be scrunched. Recollect, we must hold our own. Recollect,\r\nmoney makes money. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be uneasy, Bella, my child; don\xe2\x80\x99t you be\r\ndoubtful. The more I save, the more you shall have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella thought it was well for his wife that she was musing with her\r\naffectionate face on his shoulder; for there was a cunning light in\r\nhis eyes as he said all this, which seemed to cast a disagreeable\r\nillumination on the change in him, and make it morally uglier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN DUSTMAN FALLS INTO WORSE COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had come to pass that Mr Silas Wegg now rarely attended the minion of\r\nfortune and the worm of the hour, at his (the worm\xe2\x80\x99s and minion\xe2\x80\x99s) own\r\nhouse, but lay under general instructions to await him within a certain\r\nmargin of hours at the Bower. Mr Wegg took this arrangement in great\r\ndudgeon, because the appointed hours were evening hours, and those he\r\nconsidered precious to the progress of the friendly move. But it was\r\nquite in character, he bitterly remarked to Mr Venus, that the upstart\r\nwho had trampled on those eminent creatures, Miss Elizabeth, Master\r\nGeorge, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker, should oppress his literary man.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire having worked out its destruction, Mr Boffin next\r\nappeared in a cab with Rollin\xe2\x80\x99s Ancient History, which valuable work\r\nbeing found to possess lethargic properties, broke down, at about the\r\nperiod when the whole of the army of Alexander the Macedonian (at that\r\ntime about forty thousand strong) burst into tears simultaneously, on\r\nhis being taken with a shivering fit after bathing. The Wars of the\r\nJews, likewise languishing under Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s generalship, Mr Boffin\r\narrived in another cab with Plutarch: whose Lives he found in the sequel\r\nextremely entertaining, though he hoped Plutarch might not expect him to\r\nbelieve them all. What to believe, in the course of his reading, was Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s chief literary difficulty indeed; for some time he was divided\r\nin his mind between half, all, or none; at length, when he decided, as a\r\nmoderate man, to compound with half, the question still remained, which\r\nhalf? And that stumbling-block he never got over.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when Silas Wegg had grown accustomed to the arrival of\r\nhis patron in a cab, accompanied by some profane historian charged with\r\nunutterable names of incomprehensible peoples, of impossible descent,\r\nwaging wars any number of years and syllables long, and carrying\r\nillimitable hosts and riches about, with the greatest ease, beyond the\r\nconfines of geography--one evening the usual time passed by, and no\r\npatron appeared. After half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s grace, Mr Wegg proceeded to the\r\nouter gate, and there executed a whistle, conveying to Mr Venus,\r\nif perchance within hearing, the tidings of his being at home and\r\ndisengaged. Forth from the shelter of a neighbouring wall, Mr Venus then\r\nemerged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brother in arms,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, in excellent spirits, \xe2\x80\x98welcome!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn return, Mr Venus gave him a rather dry good evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Walk in, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas, clapping him on the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x98and take\r\nyour seat in my chimley corner; for what says the ballad?\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNo malice to dread, sir,\r\n     And no falsehood to fear,\r\n     But truth to delight me, Mr Venus,\r\n     And I forgot what to cheer.\r\n     Li toddle de om dee.\r\n     And something to guide,\r\n     My ain fireside, sir,\r\n     My ain fireside.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this quotation (depending for its neatness rather on the spirit\r\nthan the words), Mr Wegg conducted his guest to his hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you come, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, in a hospitable glow, \xe2\x80\x98you come\r\nlike I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what--exactly like it--I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know you from\r\nit--shedding a halo all around you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What kind of halo?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Ope sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Silas. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s YOUR halo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus appeared doubtful on the point, and looked rather\r\ndiscontentedly at the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll devote the evening, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98to prosecute our\r\nfriendly move. And arterwards, crushing a flowing wine-cup--which I\r\nallude to brewing rum and water--we\xe2\x80\x99ll pledge one another. For what says\r\nthe Poet?\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you needn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr Venus be your black bottle,\r\n     For surely I\xe2\x80\x99ll be mine,\r\n     And we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass with a slice of lemon in it to which\r\n     you\xe2\x80\x99re partial,\r\n     For auld lang syne.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis flow of quotation and hospitality in Wegg indicated his observation\r\nof some little querulousness on the part of Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, as to the friendly move,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the last-named gentleman,\r\nrubbing his knees peevishly, \xe2\x80\x98one of my objections to it is, that it\r\nDON\xe2\x80\x99T move.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rome, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg: \xe2\x80\x98a city which (it may not be generally\r\nknown) originated in twins and a wolf; and ended in Imperial marble:\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t built in a day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I say it was?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you did not, brother. Well-inquired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I do say,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Venus, \xe2\x80\x98that I am taken from among my trophies\r\nof anatomy, am called upon to exchange my human warious for mere\r\ncoal-ashes warious, and nothing comes of it. I think I must give up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Wegg, enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x98No, Sir!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCharge, Chester, charge,\r\n     On, Mr Venus, on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever say die, sir! A man of your mark!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much saying it that I object to,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Venus, \xe2\x80\x98as\r\ndoing it. And having got to do it whether or no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to waste\r\nmy time on groping for nothing in cinders.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But think how little time you have given to the move, sir, after all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nurged Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Add the evenings so occupied together, and what do they\r\ncome to? And you, sir, harmonizer with myself in opinions, views, and\r\nfeelings, you with the patience to fit together on wires the whole\r\nframework of society--I allude to the human skelinton--you to give in so\r\nsoon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Venus moodily, as he put his head between\r\nhis knees and stuck up his dusty hair. \xe2\x80\x98And there\xe2\x80\x99s no encouragement to\r\ngo on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not them Mounds without,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, extending his right hand with\r\nan air of solemn reasoning, \xe2\x80\x98encouragement? Not them Mounds now looking\r\ndown upon us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re too big,\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled Venus. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s a scratch here and a scrape\r\nthere, a poke in this place and a dig in the other, to them. Besides;\r\nwhat have we found?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What HAVE we found?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg, delighted to be able to acquiesce.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! There I grant you, comrade. Nothing. But on the contrary, comrade,\r\nwhat MAY we find? There you\xe2\x80\x99ll grant me. Anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it,\xe2\x80\x99 pettishly returned Venus as before. \xe2\x80\x98I came into\r\nit without enough consideration. And besides again. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t your own Mr\r\nBoffin well acquainted with the Mounds? And wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he well acquainted\r\nwith the deceased and his ways? And has he ever showed any expectation\r\nof finding anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that moment wheels were heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I should be loth,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, with an air of patient injury,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to think so ill of him as to suppose him capable of coming at this time\r\nof night. And yet it sounds like him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA ring at the yard bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98and he is capable of it. I am sorry, because\r\nI could have wished to keep up a little lingering fragment of respect\r\nfor him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr Boffin was heard lustily calling at the yard gate, \xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\r\nWegg! Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep your seat, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98He may not stop.\xe2\x80\x99 And then\r\ncalled out, \xe2\x80\x98Halloa, sir! Halloa! I\xe2\x80\x99m with you directly, sir! Half a\r\nminute, Mr Boffin. Coming, sir, as fast as my leg will bring me!\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nso with a show of much cheerful alacrity stumped out to the gate with\r\na light, and there, through the window of a cab, descried Mr Boffin\r\ninside, blocked up with books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here! lend a hand, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin excitedly, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t get out\r\ntill the way is cleared for me. This is the Annual Register, Wegg, in a\r\ncab-full of wollumes. Do you know him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Know the Animal Register, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Impostor, who had caught\r\nthe name imperfectly. \xe2\x80\x98For a trifling wager, I think I could find any\r\nAnimal in him, blindfold, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And here\xe2\x80\x99s Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s Wonderful Museum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and Caulfield\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCharacters, and Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s. Such Characters, Wegg, such Characters! I must\r\nhave one or two of the best of \xe2\x80\x98em to-night. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what places\r\nthey used to put the guineas in, wrapped up in rags. Catch hold of that\r\npile of wollumes, Wegg, or it\xe2\x80\x99ll bulge out and burst into the mud. Is\r\nthere anyone about, to help?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine, sir, that had the intention of spending\r\nthe evening with me when I gave you up--much against my will--for the\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call him out,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin in a bustle; \xe2\x80\x98get him to bear a hand.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t drop that one under your arm. It\xe2\x80\x99s Dancer. Him and his sister made\r\npies of a dead sheep they found when they were out a walking. Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour friend? Oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s your friend. Would you be so good as help Wegg\r\nand myself with these books? But don\xe2\x80\x99t take Jemmy Taylor of Southwark,\r\nnor yet Jemmy Wood of Gloucester. These are the two Jemmys. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry\r\nthem myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot ceasing to talk and bustle, in a state of great excitement, Mr\r\nBoffin directed the removal and arrangement of the books, appearing\r\nto be in some sort beside himself until they were all deposited on the\r\nfloor, and the cab was dismissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, gloating over them. \xe2\x80\x98There they are, like the\r\nfour-and-twenty fiddlers--all of a row. Get on your spectacles, Wegg;\r\nI know where to find the best of \xe2\x80\x98em, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a taste at once of\r\nwhat we have got before us. What\xe2\x80\x99s your friend\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg presented his friend as Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, catching at the name. \xe2\x80\x98Of Clerkenwell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of Clerkenwell, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of you,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I heard of you in the\r\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s time. You knew him. Did you ever buy anything of him?\xe2\x80\x99 With\r\npiercing eagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But he showed you things; didn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus, with a glance at his friend, replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he show you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, putting his hands behind him,\r\nand eagerly advancing his head. \xe2\x80\x98Did he show you boxes, little cabinets,\r\npocket-books, parcels, anything locked or sealed, anything tied up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you a judge of china?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus again shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because if he had ever showed you a teapot, I should be glad to know of\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. And then, with his right hand at his lips, repeated\r\nthoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x98a Teapot, a Teapot\xe2\x80\x99, and glanced over the books on the\r\nfloor, as if he knew there was something interesting connected with a\r\nteapot, somewhere among them.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg and Mr Venus looked at one another wonderingly: and Mr Wegg, in\r\nfitting on his spectacles, opened his eyes wide, over their rims, and\r\ntapped the side of his nose: as an admonition to Venus to keep himself\r\ngenerally wide awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Teapot,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr Boffin, continuing to muse and survey the books;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98a Teapot, a Teapot. Are you ready, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am at your service, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that gentleman, taking his usual\r\nseat on the usual settle, and poking his wooden leg under the table\r\nbefore it. \xe2\x80\x98Mr Venus, would you make yourself useful, and take a seat\r\nbeside me, sir, for the conveniency of snuffing the candles?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus complying with the invitation while it was yet being given, Silas\r\npegged at him with his wooden leg, to call his particular attention to\r\nMr Boffin standing musing before the fire, in the space between the two\r\nsettles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem! Ahem!\xe2\x80\x99 coughed Mr Wegg to attract his employer\xe2\x80\x99s attention. \xe2\x80\x98Would\r\nyou wish to commence with an Animal, sir--from the Register?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98no, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99 With that, producing a little book\r\nfrom his breast-pocket, he handed it with great care to the literary\r\ngentlemen, and inquired, \xe2\x80\x98What do you call that, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Silas, adjusting his spectacles, and referring to\r\nthe title-page, \xe2\x80\x98is Merryweather\xe2\x80\x99s Lives and Anecdotes of Misers. Mr\r\nVenus, would you make yourself useful and draw the candles a little\r\nnearer, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 This to have a special opportunity of bestowing a stare\r\nupon his comrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which of \xe2\x80\x98em have you got in that lot?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Can you find\r\nout pretty easy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Silas, turning to the table of contents and slowly\r\nfluttering the leaves of the book, \xe2\x80\x98I should say they must be pretty\r\nwell all here, sir; here\xe2\x80\x99s a large assortment, sir; my eye catches John\r\nOvers, sir, John Little, sir, Dick Jarrel, John Elwes, the Reverend Mr\r\nJones of Blewbury, Vulture Hopkins, Daniel Dancer--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give us Dancer, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nWith another stare at his comrade, Silas sought and found the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Page a hundred and nine, Mr Boffin. Chapter eight. Contents of chapter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis birth and estate. His garments and outward appearance. Miss Dancer\r\nand her feminine graces. The Miser\xe2\x80\x99s Mansion. The finding of a treasure.\r\nThe Story of the Mutton Pies. A Miser\xe2\x80\x99s Idea of Death. Bob, the Miser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncur. Griffiths and his Master. How to turn a penny. A substitute for a\r\nFire. The Advantages of keeping a Snuff-box. The Miser dies without a\r\nShirt. The Treasures of a Dunghill--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe Treasures,\xe2\x80\x9d sir,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Silas, reading very distinctly, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cof a\r\nDunghill.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Venus, sir, would you obleege with the snuffers?\xe2\x80\x99 This, to\r\nsecure attention to his adding with his lips only, \xe2\x80\x98Mounds!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin drew an arm-chair into the space where he stood, and said,\r\nseating himself and slyly rubbing his hands:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give us Dancer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg pursued the biography of that eminent man through its various\r\nphases of avarice and dirt, through Miss Dancer\xe2\x80\x99s death on a sick\r\nregimen of cold dumpling, and through Mr Dancer\xe2\x80\x99s keeping his rags\r\ntogether with a hayband, and warming his dinner by sitting upon it, down\r\nto the consolatory incident of his dying naked in a sack. After which he\r\nread on as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe house, or rather the heap of ruins, in which Mr Dancer lived, and\r\nwhich at his death devolved to the right of Captain Holmes, was a most\r\nmiserable, decayed building, for it had not been repaired for more than\r\nhalf a century.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Here Mr Wegg eyes his comrade and the room in which they sat: which had\r\nnot been repaired for a long time.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBut though poor in external structure, the ruinous fabric was very\r\nrich in the interior. It took many weeks to explore its whole contents;\r\nand Captain Holmes found it a very agreeable task to dive into the\r\nmiser\xe2\x80\x99s secret hoards.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Here Mr Wegg repeated \xe2\x80\x98secret hoards\xe2\x80\x99, and pegged his comrade again.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOne of Mr Dancer\xe2\x80\x99s richest escretoires was found to be a dungheap in\r\nthe cowhouse; a sum but little short of two thousand five hundred\r\npounds was contained in this rich piece of manure; and in an old jacket,\r\ncarefully tied, and strongly nailed down to the manger, in bank notes\r\nand gold were found five hundred pounds more.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(Here Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s wooden leg started forward under the table, and slowly\r\nelevated itself as he read on.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral bowls were discovered filled with guineas and half-guineas;\r\nand at different times on searching the corners of the house they found\r\nvarious parcels of bank notes. Some were crammed into the crevices of\r\nthe wall\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99;\r\n\r\n(Here Mr Venus looked at the wall.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cBundles were hid under the cushions and covers of the chairs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99;\r\n\r\n(Here Mr Venus looked under himself on the settle.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSome were reposing snugly at the back of the drawers; and notes\r\namounting to six hundred pounds were found neatly doubled up in the\r\ninside of an old teapot. In the stable the Captain found jugs full of\r\nold dollars and shillings. The chimney was not left unsearched, and paid\r\nvery well for the trouble; for in nineteen different holes, all filled\r\nwith soot, were found various sums of money, amounting together to more\r\nthan two hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the way to this crisis Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s wooden leg had gradually elevated\r\nitself more and more, and he had nudged Mr Venus with his opposite\r\nelbow deeper and deeper, until at length the preservation of his balance\r\nbecame incompatible with the two actions, and he now dropped over\r\nsideways upon that gentleman, squeezing him against the settle\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\nNor did either of the two, for some few seconds, make any effort to\r\nrecover himself; both remaining in a kind of pecuniary swoon.\r\n\r\nBut the sight of Mr Boffin sitting in the arm-chair hugging himself,\r\nwith his eyes upon the fire, acted as a restorative. Counterfeiting a\r\nsneeze to cover their movements, Mr Wegg, with a spasmodic \xe2\x80\x98Tish-ho!\xe2\x80\x99\r\npulled himself and Mr Venus up in a masterly manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s have some more,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, hungrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John Elwes is the next, sir. Is it your pleasure to take John Elwes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what John did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not appear to have hidden anything, so went off rather flatly.\r\nBut an exemplary lady named Wilcocks, who had stowed away gold and\r\nsilver in a pickle-pot in a clock-case, a canister-full of treasure in\r\na hole under her stairs, and a quantity of money in an old rat-trap,\r\nrevived the interest. To her succeeded another lady, claiming to be a\r\npauper, whose wealth was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper and\r\nold rag. To her, another lady, apple-woman by trade, who had saved a\r\nfortune of ten thousand pounds and hidden it \xe2\x80\x98here and there, in cracks\r\nand corners, behind bricks and under the flooring.\xe2\x80\x99 To her, a French\r\ngentleman, who had crammed up his chimney, rather to the detriment\r\nof its drawing powers, \xe2\x80\x98a leather valise, containing twenty thousand\r\nfrancs, gold coins, and a large quantity of precious stones,\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\ndiscovered by a chimneysweep after his death. By these steps Mr Wegg\r\narrived at a concluding instance of the human Magpie:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Many years ago, there lived at Cambridge a miserly old couple of the\r\nname of Jardine: they had two sons: the father was a perfect miser, and\r\nat his death one thousand guineas were discovered secreted in his bed.\r\nThe two sons grew up as parsimonious as their sire. When about twenty\r\nyears of age, they commenced business at Cambridge as drapers, and\r\nthey continued there until their death. The establishment of the Messrs\r\nJardine was the most dirty of all the shops in Cambridge. Customers\r\nseldom went in to purchase, except perhaps out of curiosity. The\r\nbrothers were most disreputable-looking beings; for, although surrounded\r\nwith gay apparel as their staple in trade, they wore the most filthy\r\nrags themselves. It is said that they had no bed, and, to save the\r\nexpense of one, always slept on a bundle of packing-cloths under the\r\ncounter. In their housekeeping they were penurious in the extreme. A\r\njoint of meat did not grace their board for twenty years. Yet when the\r\nfirst of the brothers died, the other, much to his surprise, found large\r\nsums of money which had been secreted even from him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Even from him, you see! There was only two of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em, and yet one of \xe2\x80\x98em hid from the other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus, who since his introduction to the French gentleman, had been\r\nstooping to peer up the chimney, had his attention recalled by the last\r\nsentence, and took the liberty of repeating it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, turning suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like what Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s been a-reading?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus answered that he found it extremely interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then come again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and hear some more. Come when you\r\nlike; come the day after to-morrow, half an hour sooner. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty\r\nmore; there\xe2\x80\x99s no end to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus expressed his acknowledgments and accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful what\xe2\x80\x99s been hid, at one time and another,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin, ruminating; \xe2\x80\x98truly wonderful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meaning sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Wegg, with a propitiatory face to draw him out,\r\nand with another peg at his friend and brother, \xe2\x80\x98in the way of money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Money,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! And papers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg, in a languid transport, again dropped over on Mr Venus, and\r\nagain recovering himself, masked his emotions with a sneeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tish-ho! Did you say papers too, sir? Been hidden, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hidden and forgot,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Why the bookseller that sold me\r\nthe Wonderful Museum--where\xe2\x80\x99s the Wonderful Museum?\xe2\x80\x99 He was on his knees\r\non the floor in a moment, groping eagerly among the books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I assist you, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I have got it; here it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, dusting it with the\r\nsleeve of his coat. \xe2\x80\x98Wollume four. I know it was the fourth wollume,\r\nthat the bookseller read it to me out of. Look for it, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas took the book and turned the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remarkable petrefaction, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98It can\xe2\x80\x99t have been a\r\npetrefaction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Memoirs of General John Reid, commonly called The Walking Rushlight,\r\nsir? With portrait?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, nor yet him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remarkable case of a person who swallowed a crown-piece, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To hide it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, no, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wegg, consulting the text, \xe2\x80\x98it appears to have\r\nbeen done by accident. Oh! This next must be it. \xe2\x80\x9cSingular discovery of\r\na will, lost twenty-one years.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Read that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cA most extraordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 read Silas Wegg aloud, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cwas tried at\r\nthe last Maryborough assizes in Ireland. It was briefly this. Robert\r\nBaldwin, in March 1782, made his will, in which he devised the lands now\r\nin question, to the children of his youngest son; soon after which his\r\nfaculties failed him, and he became altogether childish and died, above\r\neighty years old. The defendant, the eldest son, immediately afterwards\r\ngave out that his father had destroyed the will; and no will being\r\nfound, he entered into possession of the lands in question, and so\r\nmatters remained for twenty-one years, the whole family during all\r\nthat time believing that the father had died without a will. But after\r\ntwenty-one years the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s wife died, and he very soon afterwards,\r\nat the age of seventy-eight, married a very young woman: which caused\r\nsome anxiety to his two sons, whose poignant expressions of this feeling\r\nso exasperated their father, that he in his resentment executed a will\r\nto disinherit his eldest son, and in his fit of anger showed it to his\r\nsecond son, who instantly determined to get at it, and destroy it, in\r\norder to preserve the property to his brother. With this view, he broke\r\nopen his father\xe2\x80\x99s desk, where he found--not his father\xe2\x80\x99s will which he\r\nsought after, but the will of his grandfather, which was then altogether\r\nforgotten in the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98See what men put away and forget, or mean to\r\ndestroy, and don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 He then added in a slow tone, \xe2\x80\x98As--ton--ish--ing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd as he rolled his eyes all round the room, Wegg and Venus likewise\r\nrolled their eyes all round the room. And then Wegg, singly, fixed his\r\neyes on Mr Boffin looking at the fire again; as if he had a mind to\r\nspring upon him and demand his thoughts or his life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, time\xe2\x80\x99s up for to-night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, waving his hand after\r\na silence. \xe2\x80\x98More, the day after to-morrow. Range the books upon the\r\nshelves, Wegg. I dare say Mr Venus will be so kind as help you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile speaking, he thrust his hand into the breast of his outer coat,\r\nand struggled with some object there that was too large to be got out\r\neasily. What was the stupefaction of the friendly movers when this\r\nobject at last emerging, proved to be a much-dilapidated dark lantern!\r\n\r\nWithout at all noticing the effect produced by this little instrument,\r\nMr Boffin stood it on his knee, and, producing a box of matches,\r\ndeliberately lighted the candle in the lantern, blew out the kindled\r\nmatch, and cast the end into the fire. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 he then\r\nannounced, \xe2\x80\x98to take a turn about the place and round the yard. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you. Me and this same lantern have taken hundreds--thousands--of\r\nsuch turns in our time together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think, sir--not on any account, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99--Wegg was\r\npolitely beginning, when Mr Boffin, who had risen and was going towards\r\nthe door, stopped:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have told you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg looked intelligently thoughtful, as if that had not occurred to his\r\nmind until he now brought it to bear on the circumstance. He had nothing\r\nfor it but to let Mr Boffin go out and shut the door behind him. But,\r\nthe instant he was on the other side of it, Wegg clutched Venus\r\nwith both hands, and said in a choking whisper, as if he were being\r\nstrangled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Venus, he must be followed, he must be watched, he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be lost\r\nsight of for a moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why mustn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Venus, also strangling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Comrade, you might have noticed I was a little elewated in spirits when\r\nyou come in to-night. I\xe2\x80\x99ve found something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you found?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Venus, clutching him with both hands, so\r\nthat they stood interlocked like a couple of preposterous gladiators.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no time to tell you now. I think he must have gone to look for\r\nit. We must have an eye upon him instantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReleasing each other, they crept to the door, opened it softly, and\r\npeeped out. It was a cloudy night, and the black shadow of the Mounds\r\nmade the dark yard darker. \xe2\x80\x98If not a double swindler,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Wegg,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98why a dark lantern? We could have seen what he was about, if he had\r\ncarried a light one. Softly, this way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCautiously along the path that was bordered by fragments of crockery set\r\nin ashes, the two stole after him. They could hear him at his peculiar\r\ntrot, crushing the loose cinders as he went. \xe2\x80\x98He knows the place by\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Silas, \xe2\x80\x98and don\xe2\x80\x99t need to turn his lantern on, confound\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x99 But he did turn it on, almost in that same instant, and flashed\r\nits light upon the first of the Mounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the spot?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Venus in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s warm,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas in the same tone. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s precious warm. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclose. I think he must be going to look for it. What\xe2\x80\x99s that he\xe2\x80\x99s got in\r\nhis hand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A shovel,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Venus. \xe2\x80\x98And he knows how to use it, remember, fifty\r\ntimes as well as either of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he looks for it and misses it, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98what shall\r\nwe do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First of all, wait till he does,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\nDiscreet advice too, for he darkened his lantern again, and the mound\r\nturned black. After a few seconds, he turned the light on once more, and\r\nwas seen standing at the foot of the second mound, slowly raising the\r\nlantern little by little until he held it up at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, as if he\r\nwere examining the condition of the whole surface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That can\xe2\x80\x99t be the spot too?\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s getting cold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It strikes me,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Venus, \xe2\x80\x98that he wants to find out whether any\r\none has been groping about there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s getting colder and colder.--Now he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfreezing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis exclamation was elicited by his having turned the lantern off\r\nagain, and on again, and being visible at the foot of the third mound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, he\xe2\x80\x99s going up it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shovel and all!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg.\r\n\r\nAt a nimbler trot, as if the shovel over his shoulder stimulated him by\r\nreviving old associations, Mr Boffin ascended the \xe2\x80\x98serpentining walk\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nup the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg on the occasion of\r\ntheir beginning to decline and fall. On striking into it he turned his\r\nlantern off. The two followed him, stooping low, so that their figures\r\nmight make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his\r\nlantern on again. Mr Venus took the lead, towing Mr Wegg, in order that\r\nhis refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it\r\nshould dig for itself. They could just make out that the Golden Dustman\r\nstopped to breathe. Of course they stopped too, instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is his own Mound,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Wegg, as he recovered his wind, \xe2\x80\x98this\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why all three are his own,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he thinks; but he\xe2\x80\x99s used to call this his own, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the one\r\nfirst left to him; the one that was his legacy when it was all he took\r\nunder the will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he shows his light,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, keeping watch upon his dusky\r\nfigure all the time, \xe2\x80\x98drop lower and keep closer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went on again, and they followed again. Gaining the top of the Mound,\r\nhe turned on his light--but only partially--and stood it on the ground.\r\nA bare lopsided weatherbeaten pole was planted in the ashes there,\r\nand had been there many a year. Hard by this pole, his lantern stood:\r\nlighting a few feet of the lower part of it and a little of the ashy\r\nsurface around, and then casting off a purposeless little clear trail of\r\nlight into the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can never be going to dig up the pole!\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Venus as they\r\ndropped low and kept close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s holler and full of something,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Wegg.\r\n\r\nHe was going to dig, with whatsoever object, for he tucked up his cuffs\r\nand spat on his hands, and then went at it like an old digger as he\r\nwas. He had no design upon the pole, except that he measured a shovel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlength from it before beginning, nor was it his purpose to dig deep.\r\nSome dozen or so of expert strokes sufficed. Then, he stopped, looked\r\ndown into the cavity, bent over it, and took out what appeared to be an\r\nordinary case-bottle: one of those squat, high-shouldered, short-necked\r\nglass bottles which the Dutchman is said to keep his Courage in. As soon\r\nas he had done this, he turned off his lantern, and they could hear that\r\nhe was filling up the hole in the dark. The ashes being easily moved by\r\na skilful hand, the spies took this as a hint to make off in good time.\r\nAccordingly, Mr Venus slipped past Mr Wegg and towed him down. But Mr\r\nWegg\xe2\x80\x99s descent was not accomplished without some personal inconvenience,\r\nfor his self-willed leg sticking into the ashes about half way down, and\r\ntime pressing, Mr Venus took the liberty of hauling him from his tether\r\nby the collar: which occasioned him to make the rest of the journey on\r\nhis back, with his head enveloped in the skirts of his coat, and his\r\nwooden leg coming last, like a drag. So flustered was Mr Wegg by this\r\nmode of travelling, that when he was set on the level ground with his\r\nintellectual developments uppermost, he was quite unconscious of his\r\nbearings, and had not the least idea where his place of residence was\r\nto be found, until Mr Venus shoved him into it. Even then he staggered\r\nround and round, weakly staring about him, until Mr Venus with a hard\r\nbrush brushed his senses into him and the dust out of him.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin came down leisurely, for this brushing process had been well\r\naccomplished, and Mr Venus had had time to take his breath, before he\r\nreappeared. That he had the bottle somewhere about him could not be\r\ndoubted; where, was not so clear. He wore a large rough coat, buttoned\r\nover, and it might be in any one of half a dozen pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98You are as pale as a\r\ncandle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg replied, with literal exactness, that he felt as if he had had a\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bile,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, blowing out the light in the lantern, shutting\r\nit up, and stowing it away in the breast of his coat as before. \xe2\x80\x98Are you\r\nsubject to bile, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg again replied, with strict adherence to truth, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink he had ever had a similar sensation in his head, to anything like\r\nthe same extent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Physic yourself to-morrow, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98to be in order\r\nfor next night. By-the-by, this neighbourhood is going to have a loss,\r\nWegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A loss, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going to lose the Mounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe friendly movers made such an obvious effort not to look at one\r\nanother, that they might as well have stared at one another with all\r\ntheir might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you parted with them, Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; they\xe2\x80\x99re going. Mine\xe2\x80\x99s as good as gone already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean the little one of the three, with the pole atop, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, rubbing his ear in his old way, with that new\r\ntouch of craftiness added to it. \xe2\x80\x98It has fetched a penny. It\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to\r\nbe carted off to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been out to take leave of your old friend, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Silas,\r\njocosely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98What the devil put that in your head?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was so sudden and rough, that Wegg, who had been hovering closer\r\nand closer to his skirts, despatching the back of his hand on exploring\r\nexpeditions in search of the bottle\xe2\x80\x99s surface, retired two or three\r\npaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No offence, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, humbly. \xe2\x80\x98No offence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin eyed him as a dog might eye another dog who wanted his bone;\r\nand actually retorted with a low growl, as the dog might have retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after having sunk into a moody silence, with\r\nhis hands clasped behind him, and his eyes suspiciously wandering about\r\nWegg.--\xe2\x80\x98No! stop there. I know the way out, and I want no light.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAvarice, and the evening\xe2\x80\x99s legends of avarice, and the inflammatory\r\neffect of what he had seen, and perhaps the rush of his ill-conditioned\r\nblood to his brain in his descent, wrought Silas Wegg to such a pitch of\r\ninsatiable appetite, that when the door closed he made a swoop at it and\r\ndrew Venus along with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. \xe2\x80\x98We mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let him go? He has got that\r\nbottle about him. We must have that bottle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it by force?\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, restraining him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Yes I would. I\xe2\x80\x99d take it by any force, I\xe2\x80\x99d have it at any\r\nprice! Are you so afraid of one old man as to let him go, you coward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so afraid of you, as not to let YOU go,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Venus, sturdily,\r\nclasping him in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you hear him?\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Did you hear him say that he was\r\nresolved to disappoint us? Did you hear him say, you cur, that he was\r\ngoing to have the Mounds cleared off, when no doubt the whole place will\r\nbe rummaged? If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t the spirit of a mouse to defend your rights,\r\nI have. Let me go after him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs in his wildness he was making a strong struggle for it, Mr Venus\r\ndeemed it expedient to lift him, throw him, and fall with him; well\r\nknowing that, once down, he would not be up again easily with his wooden\r\nleg. So they both rolled on the floor, and, as they did so, Mr Boffin\r\nshut the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nTHE FRIENDLY MOVE TAKES UP A STRONG POSITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe friendly movers sat upright on the floor, panting and eyeing one\r\nanother, after Mr Boffin had slammed the gate and gone away. In the weak\r\neyes of Venus, and in every reddish dust-coloured hair in his shock of\r\nhair, there was a marked distrust of Wegg and an alertness to fly at him\r\non perceiving the smallest occasion. In the hard-grained face of Wegg,\r\nand in his stiff knotty figure (he looked like a German wooden toy),\r\nthere was expressed a politic conciliation, which had no spontaneity in\r\nit. Both were flushed, flustered, and rumpled, by the late scuffle; and\r\nWegg, in coming to the ground, had received a humming knock on the back\r\nof his devoted head, which caused him still to rub it with an air of\r\nhaving been highly--but disagreeably--astonished. Each was silent for\r\nsome time, leaving it to the other to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, at length breaking the silence, \xe2\x80\x98you were right,\r\nand I was wrong. I forgot myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus knowingly cocked his shock of hair, as rather thinking Mr Wegg\r\nhad remembered himself, in respect of appearing without any disguise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But comrade,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98it was never your lot to know Miss\r\nElizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, nor Uncle Parker.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus admitted that he had never known those distinguished persons,\r\nand added, in effect, that he had never so much as desired the honour of\r\ntheir acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, comrade!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Wegg: \xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that! Because,\r\nwithout having known them, you never can fully know what it is to be\r\nstimilated to frenzy by the sight of the Usurper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOffering these excusatory words as if they reflected great credit on\r\nhimself, Mr Wegg impelled himself with his hands towards a chair in\r\na corner of the room, and there, after a variety of awkward gambols,\r\nattained a perpendicular position. Mr Venus also rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Comrade,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98take a seat. Comrade, what a speaking countenance\r\nis yours!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus involuntarily smoothed his countenance, and looked at his hand,\r\nas if to see whether any of its speaking properties came off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For clearly do I know, mark you,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Wegg, pointing his words\r\nwith his forefinger, \xe2\x80\x98clearly do I know what question your expressive\r\nfeatures puts to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What question?\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The question,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, with a sort of joyful affability, \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention sooner, that I had found something. Says your speaking\r\ncountenance to me: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you communicate that, when I first come\r\nin this evening? Why did you keep it back till you thought Mr Boffin had\r\ncome to look for the article?\xe2\x80\x9d Your speaking countenance,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98puts it plainer than language. Now, you can\xe2\x80\x99t read in my face what\r\nanswer I give?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew it! And why not?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, with the same joyful candour.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I lay no claims to a speaking countenance. Because I am well\r\naware of my deficiencies. All men are not gifted alike. But I can answer\r\nin words. And in what words? These. I wanted to give you a delightful\r\nsap--pur--IZE!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving thus elongated and emphasized the word Surprise, Mr Wegg shook\r\nhis friend and brother by both hands, and then clapped him on both\r\nknees, like an affectionate patron who entreated him not to mention so\r\nsmall a service as that which it had been his happy privilege to render.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your speaking countenance,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98being answered to its\r\nsatisfaction, only asks then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you found?\xe2\x80\x9d Why, I hear it say\r\nthe words!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Venus snappishly, after waiting in vain. \xe2\x80\x98If you hear\r\nit say the words, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to. Hear me out! Man and brother,\r\npartner in feelings equally with undertakings and actions, I have found\r\na cash-box.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. (He tried to reserve whatever he could, and,\r\nwhenever disclosure was forced upon him, broke into a radiant gush of\r\nHear me out.) \xe2\x80\x98On a certain day, sir--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When?\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus bluntly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N--no,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, shaking his head at once observantly,\r\nthoughtfully, and playfully. \xe2\x80\x98No, sir! That\xe2\x80\x99s not your expressive\r\ncountenance which asks that question. That\xe2\x80\x99s your voice; merely your\r\nvoice. To proceed. On a certain day, sir, I happened to be walking in\r\nthe yard--taking my lonely round--for in the words of a friend of my own\r\nfamily, the author of All\xe2\x80\x99s Well arranged as a duett:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cDeserted, as you will remember Mr Venus, by the waning\r\n     moon,\r\n     When stars, it will occur to you before I mention it, proclaim\r\n     night\xe2\x80\x99s cheerless noon,\r\n     On tower, fort, or tented ground,\r\n     The sentry walks his lonely round,\r\n     The sentry walks:\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n--under those circumstances, sir, I happened to be walking in the yard\r\nearly one afternoon, and happened to have an iron rod in my hand, with\r\nwhich I have been sometimes accustomed to beguile the monotony of a\r\nliterary life, when I struck it against an object not necessary to\r\ntrouble you by naming--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is necessary. What object?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Venus, in a wrathful tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98The Pump.--When I struck it against the\r\nPump, and found, not only that the top was loose and opened with a lid,\r\nbut that something in it rattled. That something, comrade, I discovered\r\nto be a small flat oblong cash-box. Shall I say it was disappointingly\r\nlight?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There were papers in it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There your expressive countenance speaks indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\npaper. The box was locked, tied up, and sealed, and on the outside was\r\na parchment label, with the writing, \xe2\x80\x9cMY WILL, JOHN HARMON, TEMPORARILY\r\nDEPOSITED HERE.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must know its contents,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98I said so, and I broke the box open.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Without coming to me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, blandly and buoyantly. \xe2\x80\x98I see I take\r\nyou with me! Hear, hear, hear! Resolved, as your discriminating good\r\nsense perceives, that if you was to have a sap--pur--IZE, it should be\r\na complete one! Well, sir. And so, as you have honoured me by\r\nanticipating, I examined the document. Regularly executed, regularly\r\nwitnessed, very short. Inasmuch as he has never made friends, and has\r\never had a rebellious family, he, John Harmon, gives to Nicodemus Boffin\r\nthe Little Mound, which is quite enough for him, and gives the whole\r\nrest and residue of his property to the Crown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The date of the will that has been proved, must be looked to,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked\r\nVenus. \xe2\x80\x98It may be later than this one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98I said so. I paid a shilling (never mind\r\nyour sixpence of it) to look up that will. Brother, that will is dated\r\nmonths before this will. And now, as a fellow-man, and as a partner in a\r\nfriendly move,\xe2\x80\x99 added Wegg, benignantly taking him by both hands again,\r\nand clapping him on both knees again, \xe2\x80\x98say have I completed my labour of\r\nlove to your perfect satisfaction, and are you sap--pur--IZED?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus contemplated his fellow-man and partner with doubting eyes, and\r\nthen rejoined stiffly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is great news indeed, Mr Wegg. There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying it. But I could\r\nhave wished you had told it me before you got your fright to-night, and\r\nI could have wished you had ever asked me as your partner what we were\r\nto do, before you thought you were dividing a responsibility.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98I knew you was a-going to say so. But\r\nalone I bore the anxiety, and alone I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear the blame!\xe2\x80\x99 This with an\r\nair of great magnanimity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s see this will and this box.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I understand, brother,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg with considerable reluctance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that it is your wish to see this will and this--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus smote the table with his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Hear me out! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter being some time absent, as if in his covetousness he could hardly\r\nmake up his mind to produce the treasure to his partner, he returned\r\nwith an old leathern hat-box, into which he had put the other box,\r\nfor the better preservation of commonplace appearances, and for the\r\ndisarming of suspicion. \xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t half like opening it here,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nSilas in a low voice, looking around: \xe2\x80\x98he might come back, he may not be\r\ngone; we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he may be up to, after what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s something in that,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Come to my place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJealous of the custody of the box, and yet fearful of opening it under\r\nthe existing circumstances, Wegg hesitated. \xe2\x80\x98Come, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated\r\nVenus, chafing, \xe2\x80\x98to my place.\xe2\x80\x99 Not very well seeing his way to a\r\nrefusal, Mr Wegg then rejoined in a gush, \xe2\x80\x98--Hear me out!--Certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo he locked up the Bower and they set forth: Mr Venus taking his arm,\r\nand keeping it with remarkable tenacity.\r\n\r\nThey found the usual dim light burning in the window of Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestablishment, imperfectly disclosing to the public the usual pair\r\nof preserved frogs, sword in hand, with their point of honour still\r\nunsettled. Mr Venus had closed his shop door on coming out, and now\r\nopened it with the key and shut it again as soon as they were within;\r\nbut not before he had put up and barred the shutters of the shop window.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one can get in without being let in,\xe2\x80\x99 said he then, \xe2\x80\x98and we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe more snug than here.\xe2\x80\x99 So he raked together the yet warm cinders in\r\nthe rusty grate, and made a fire, and trimmed the candle on the little\r\ncounter. As the fire cast its flickering gleams here and there upon the\r\ndark greasy walls; the Hindoo baby, the African baby, the articulated\r\nEnglish baby, the assortment of skulls, and the rest of the collection,\r\ncame starting to their various stations as if they had all been out,\r\nlike their master and were punctual in a general rendezvous to assist\r\nat the secret. The French gentleman had grown considerably since Mr Wegg\r\nlast saw him, being now accommodated with a pair of legs and a head,\r\nthough his arms were yet in abeyance. To whomsoever the head had\r\noriginally belonged, Silas Wegg would have regarded it as a personal\r\nfavour if he had not cut quite so many teeth.\r\n\r\nSilas took his seat in silence on the wooden box before the fire, and\r\nVenus dropping into his low chair produced from among his skeleton\r\nhands, his tea-tray and tea-cups, and put the kettle on. Silas inwardly\r\napproved of these preparations, trusting they might end in Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiluting his intellect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98all is safe and quiet. Let us see this\r\ndiscovery.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith still reluctant hands, and not without several glances towards the\r\nskeleton hands, as if he mistrusted that a couple of them might spring\r\nforth and clutch the document, Wegg opened the hat-box and revealed the\r\ncash-box, opened the cash-box and revealed the will. He held a corner\r\nof it tight, while Venus, taking hold of another corner, searchingly and\r\nattentively read it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was I correct in my account of it, partner?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partner, you were,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg thereupon made an easy, graceful movement, as though he would\r\nfold it up; but Mr Venus held on by his corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus, winking his weak eyes and shaking his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, partner. The question is now brought up, who is going to take care\r\nof this. Do you know who is going to take care of this, partner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear no, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Venus. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake. I am. Now look\r\nhere, Mr Wegg. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any words with you, and still less\r\ndo I want to have any anatomical pursuits with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Venus, slowly, \xe2\x80\x98that it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly possible\r\nfor a man to feel in a more amiable state towards another man than I\r\ndo towards you at this present moment. But I am on my own ground, I am\r\nsurrounded by the trophies of my art, and my tools is very handy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, Mr Venus?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Wegg again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am surrounded, as I have observed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus, placidly, \xe2\x80\x98by\r\nthe trophies of my art. They are numerous, my stock of human warious is\r\nlarge, the shop is pretty well crammed, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t just now want any\r\nmore trophies of my art. But I like my art, and I know how to exercise\r\nmy art.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No man better,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr Wegg, with a somewhat staggered air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s the Miscellanies of several human specimens,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98(though you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t think it) in the box on which you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the Miscellanies of several human specimens, in the lovely\r\ncompo-one behind the door\xe2\x80\x99; with a nod towards the French gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nstill wants a pair of arms. I DON\xe2\x80\x99T say that I\xe2\x80\x99m in any hurry for \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must be wandering in your mind, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 Silas remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me if I wander,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus; \xe2\x80\x98I am sometimes rather\r\nsubject to it. I like my art, and I know how to exercise my art, and I\r\nmean to have the keeping of this document.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what has that got to do with your art, partner?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Wegg, in an\r\ninsinuating tone.\r\n\r\nMr Venus winked his chronically-fatigued eyes both at once, and\r\nadjusting the kettle on the fire, remarked to himself, in a hollow\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99ll bile in a couple of minutes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas Wegg glanced at the kettle, glanced at the shelves, glanced at the\r\nFrench gentleman behind the door, and shrank a little as he glanced at\r\nMr Venus winking his red eyes, and feeling in his waistcoat pocket--as\r\nfor a lancet, say--with his unoccupied hand. He and Venus were\r\nnecessarily seated close together, as each held a corner of the\r\ndocument, which was but a common sheet of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, even more insinuatingly than before, \xe2\x80\x98I propose\r\nthat we cut it in half, and each keep a half.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus shook his shock of hair, as he replied, \xe2\x80\x98It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to\r\nmutilate it, partner. It might seem to be cancelled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, after a silence, during which they had\r\ncontemplated one another, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t your speaking countenance say that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a-going to suggest a middle course?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus shook his shock of hair as he replied, \xe2\x80\x98Partner, you have kept\r\nthis paper from me once. You shall never keep it from me again. I offer\r\nyou the box and the label to take care of, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of the\r\npaper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas hesitated a little longer, and then suddenly releasing his corner,\r\nand resuming his buoyant and benignant tone, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\nwithout trustfulness! What\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow-man without honour! You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome\r\nto it, partner, in a spirit of trust and confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nContinuing to wink his red eyes both together--but in a self-communing\r\nway, and without any show of triumph--Mr Venus folded the paper now left\r\nin his hand, and locked it in a drawer behind him, and pocketed the key.\r\nHe then proposed \xe2\x80\x98A cup of tea, partner?\xe2\x80\x99 To which Mr Wegg returned,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 and the tea was made and poured out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Next,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, blowing at his tea in his saucer, and looking over\r\nit at his confidential friend, \xe2\x80\x98comes the question, What\xe2\x80\x99s the course to\r\nbe pursued?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn this head, Silas Wegg had much to say. Silas had to say That, he\r\nwould beg to remind his comrade, brother, and partner, of the impressive\r\npassages they had read that evening; of the evident parallel in Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s mind between them and the late owner of the Bower, and the\r\npresent circumstances of the Bower; of the bottle; and of the box. That,\r\nthe fortunes of his brother and comrade, and of himself were evidently\r\nmade, inasmuch as they had but to put their price upon this document,\r\nand get that price from the minion of fortune and the worm of the hour:\r\nwho now appeared to be less of a minion and more of a worm than had been\r\npreviously supposed. That, he considered it plain that such price was\r\nstateable in a single expressive word, and that the word was, \xe2\x80\x98Halves!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThat, the question then arose when \xe2\x80\x98Halves!\xe2\x80\x99 should be called. That,\r\nhere he had a plan of action to recommend, with a conditional clause.\r\nThat, the plan of action was that they should lie by with patience;\r\nthat, they should allow the Mounds to be gradually levelled and cleared\r\naway, while retaining to themselves their present opportunity of\r\nwatching the process--which would be, he conceived, to put the trouble\r\nand cost of daily digging and delving upon somebody else, while they\r\nmight nightly turn such complete disturbance of the dust to the account\r\nof their own private investigations--and that, when the Mounds were\r\ngone, and they had worked those chances for their own joint benefit\r\nsolely, they should then, and not before, explode on the minion and\r\nworm. But here came the conditional clause, and to this he entreated the\r\nspecial attention of his comrade, brother, and partner. It was not to\r\nbe borne that the minion and worm should carry off any of that property\r\nwhich was now to be regarded as their own property. When he, Mr Wegg,\r\nhad seen the minion surreptitiously making off with that bottle, and its\r\nprecious contents unknown, he had looked upon him in the light of a mere\r\nrobber, and, as such, would have despoiled him of his ill-gotten gain,\r\nbut for the judicious interference of his comrade, brother, and partner.\r\nTherefore, the conditional clause he proposed was, that, if the minion\r\nshould return in his late sneaking manner, and if, being closely\r\nwatched, he should be found to possess himself of anything, no matter\r\nwhat, the sharp sword impending over his head should be instantly shown\r\nhim, he should be strictly examined as to what he knew or suspected,\r\nshould be severely handled by them his masters, and should be kept in\r\na state of abject moral bondage and slavery until the time when they\r\nshould see fit to permit him to purchase his freedom at the price of\r\nhalf his possessions. If, said Mr Wegg by way of peroration, he had\r\nerred in saying only \xe2\x80\x98Halves!\xe2\x80\x99 he trusted to his comrade, brother, and\r\npartner not to hesitate to set him right, and to reprove his weakness.\r\nIt might be more according to the rights of things, to say\r\nTwo-thirds; it might be more according to the rights of things, to say\r\nThree-fourths. On those points he was ever open to correction.\r\n\r\nMr Venus, having wafted his attention to this discourse over three\r\nsuccessive saucers of tea, signified his concurrence in the views\r\nadvanced. Inspirited hereby, Mr Wegg extended his right hand, and\r\ndeclared it to be a hand which never yet. Without entering into more\r\nminute particulars. Mr Venus, sticking to his tea, briefly professed his\r\nbelief as polite forms required of him, that it WAS a hand which never\r\nyet. But contented himself with looking at it, and did not take it to\r\nhis bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, when this happy understanding was established, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nshould like to ask you something. You remember the night when I first\r\nlooked in here, and found you floating your powerful mind in tea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill swilling tea, Mr Venus nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there you sit, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Wegg with an air of thoughtful\r\nadmiration, \xe2\x80\x98as if you had never left off! There you sit, sir, as if you\r\nhad an unlimited capacity of assimilating the flagrant article! There\r\nyou sit, sir, in the midst of your works, looking as if you\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\ncalled upon for Home, Sweet Home, and was obleeging the company!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA exile from home splendour dazzles in vain,\r\n     O give you your lowly Preparations again,\r\n     The birds stuffed so sweetly that can\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to come at\r\n     your call,\r\n     Give you these with the peace of mind dearer than all.\r\n     Home, Home, Home, sweet Home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n--Be it ever,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr Wegg in prose as he glanced about the shop,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ever so ghastly, all things considered there\xe2\x80\x99s no place like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said you\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask something; but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked it,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nremarked Venus, very unsympathetic in manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your peace of mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, offering condolence, \xe2\x80\x98your peace of\r\nmind was in a poor way that night. HOW\xe2\x80\x99S it going on? IS it looking up\r\nat all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She does not wish,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Venus with a comical mixture of\r\nindignant obstinacy and tender melancholy, \xe2\x80\x98to regard herself, nor yet\r\nto be regarded, in that particular light. There\xe2\x80\x99s no more to be said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, dear me, dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wegg with a sigh, but eyeing him while\r\npretending to keep him company in eyeing the fire, \xe2\x80\x98such is Woman! And\r\nI remember you said that night, sitting there as I sat here--said that\r\nnight when your peace of mind was first laid low, that you had taken an\r\ninterest in these very affairs. Such is coincidence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her father,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Venus, and then stopped to swallow more tea, \xe2\x80\x98her\r\nfather was mixed up in them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention her name, sir, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 observed Wegg, pensively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention her name that night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pleasant Riderhood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In--deed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Pleasant Riderhood. There\xe2\x80\x99s something moving in\r\nthe name. Pleasant. Dear me! Seems to express what she might have\r\nbeen, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made that unpleasant remark--and what she ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nin consequence of having made it. Would it at all pour balm into your\r\nwounds, Mr Venus, to inquire how you came acquainted with her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was down at the water-side,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, taking another gulp of\r\ntea and mournfully winking at the fire--\xe2\x80\x98looking for parrots\xe2\x80\x99--taking\r\nanother gulp and stopping.\r\n\r\nMr Wegg hinted, to jog his attention: \xe2\x80\x98You could hardly have been out\r\nparrot-shooting, in the British climate, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus fretfully. \xe2\x80\x98I was down at the water-side,\r\nlooking for parrots brought home by sailors, to buy for stuffing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay, ay, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--And looking for a nice pair of rattlesnakes, to articulate for a\r\nMuseum--when I was doomed to fall in with her and deal with her. It was\r\njust at the time of that discovery in the river. Her father had seen the\r\ndiscovery being towed in the river. I made the popularity of the subject\r\na reason for going back to improve the acquaintance, and I have never\r\nsince been the man I was. My very bones is rendered flabby by brooding\r\nover it. If they could be brought to me loose, to sort, I should hardly\r\nhave the face to claim \xe2\x80\x98em as mine. To such an extent have I fallen off\r\nunder it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg, less interested than he had been, glanced at one particular\r\nshelf in the dark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why I remember, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a tone of friendly commiseration\r\n\xe2\x80\x98(for I remember every word that falls from you, sir), I remember that\r\nyou said that night, you had got up there--and then your words was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--The parrot that I bought of her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, with a despondent rise\r\nand fall of his eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Yes; there it lies on its side, dried up; except\r\nfor its plumage, very like myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had the heart to prepare\r\nit, and I never shall have now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a disappointed face, Silas mentally consigned this parrot to\r\nregions more than tropical, and, seeming for the time to have lost\r\nhis power of assuming an interest in the woes of Mr Venus, fell to\r\ntightening his wooden leg as a preparation for departure: its gymnastic\r\nperformances of that evening having severely tried its constitution.\r\n\r\nAfter Silas had left the shop, hat-box in hand, and had left Mr Venus\r\nto lower himself to oblivion-point with the requisite weight of tea, it\r\ngreatly preyed on his ingenuous mind that he had taken this artist into\r\npartnership at all. He bitterly felt that he had overreached himself in\r\nthe beginning, by grasping at Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s mere straws of hints, now shown\r\nto be worthless for his purpose. Casting about for ways and means of\r\ndissolving the connexion without loss of money, reproaching himself for\r\nhaving been betrayed into an avowal of his secret, and complimenting\r\nhimself beyond measure on his purely accidental good luck, he beguiled\r\nthe distance between Clerkenwell and the mansion of the Golden Dustman.\r\n\r\nFor, Silas Wegg felt it to be quite out of the question that he could\r\nlay his head upon his pillow in peace, without first hovering over\r\nMr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house in the superior character of its Evil Genius. Power\r\n(unless it be the power of intellect or virtue) has ever the greatest\r\nattraction for the lowest natures; and the mere defiance of the\r\nunconscious house-front, with his power to strip the roof off the\r\ninhabiting family like the roof of a house of cards, was a treat which\r\nhad a charm for Silas Wegg.\r\n\r\nAs he hovered on the opposite side of the street, exulting, the carriage\r\ndrove up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99ll shortly be an end of YOU,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, threatening it with the\r\nhat-box. \xe2\x80\x98YOUR varnish is fading.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin descended and went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look out for a fall, my Lady Dustwoman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg.\r\n\r\nBella lightly descended, and ran in after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How brisk we are!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t run so gaily to your old\r\nshabby home, my girl. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go there, though.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little while, and the Secretary came out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was passed over for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98But you had better provide\r\nyourself with another situation, young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s shadow passed upon the blinds of three large windows as he\r\ntrotted down the room, and passed again as he went back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yoop!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re there, are you? Where\xe2\x80\x99s the bottle? You\r\nwould give your bottle for my box, Dustman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving now composed his mind for slumber, he turned homeward. Such\r\nwas the greed of the fellow, that his mind had shot beyond halves,\r\ntwo-thirds, three-fourths, and gone straight to spoliation of the whole.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Though that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite do,\xe2\x80\x99 he considered, growing cooler as he got\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what would happen to him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy us up. We should\r\nget nothing by that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe so judge others by ourselves, that it had never come into his head\r\nbefore, that he might not buy us up, and might prove honest, and prefer\r\nto be poor. It caused him a slight tremor as it passed; but a very\r\nslight one, for the idle thought was gone directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s grown too fond of money for that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg; \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s grown too fond\r\nof money.\xe2\x80\x99 The burden fell into a strain or tune as he stumped along the\r\npavements. All the way home he stumped it out of the rattling streets,\r\nPIANO with his own foot, and FORTE with his wooden leg, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s GROWN too\r\nFOND of MONEY for THAT, he\xe2\x80\x99s GROWN too FOND of MONEY.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven next day Silas soothed himself with this melodious strain, when he\r\nwas called out of bed at daybreak, to set open the yard-gate and admit\r\nthe train of carts and horses that came to carry off the little Mound.\r\nAnd all day long, as he kept unwinking watch on the slow process which\r\npromised to protract itself through many days and weeks, whenever\r\n(to save himself from being choked with dust) he patrolled a little\r\ncinderous beat he established for the purpose, without taking his eyes\r\nfrom the diggers, he still stumped to the tune: He\xe2\x80\x99s GROWN too FOND of\r\nMONEY for THAT, he\xe2\x80\x99s GROWN too FOND of MONEY.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nTHE END OF A LONG JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train of carts and horses came and went all day from dawn to\r\nnightfall, making little or no daily impression on the heap of ashes,\r\nthough, as the days passed on, the heap was seen to be slowly melting.\r\nMy lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, when you in the course\r\nof your dust-shovelling and cinder-raking have piled up a mountain of\r\npretentious failure, you must off with your honourable coats for the\r\nremoval of it, and fall to the work with the power of all the queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorses and all the queen\xe2\x80\x99s men, or it will come rushing down and bury us\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nYes, verily, my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, adapting your\r\nCatechism to the occasion, and by God\xe2\x80\x99s help so you must. For when we\r\nhave got things to the pass that with an enormous treasure at disposal\r\nto relieve the poor, the best of the poor detest our mercies, hide their\r\nheads from us, and shame us by starving to death in the midst of us, it\r\nis a pass impossible of prosperity, impossible of continuance. It may\r\nnot be so written in the Gospel according to Podsnappery; you may not\r\n\xe2\x80\x98find these words\xe2\x80\x99 for the text of a sermon, in the Returns of the Board\r\nof Trade; but they have been the truth since the foundations of the\r\nuniverse were laid, and they will be the truth until the foundations of\r\nthe universe are shaken by the Builder. This boastful handiwork of\r\nours, which fails in its terrors for the professional pauper, the sturdy\r\nbreaker of windows and the rampant tearer of clothes, strikes with a\r\ncruel and a wicked stab at the stricken sufferer, and is a horror to\r\nthe deserving and unfortunate. We must mend it, lords and gentlemen and\r\nhonourable boards, or in its own evil hour it will mar every one of us.\r\n\r\nOld Betty Higden fared upon her pilgrimage as many ruggedly honest\r\ncreatures, women and men, fare on their toiling way along the roads\r\nof life. Patiently to earn a spare bare living, and quietly to die,\r\nuntouched by workhouse hands--this was her highest sublunary hope.\r\n\r\nNothing had been heard of her at Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house since she trudged\r\noff. The weather had been hard and the roads had been bad, and her\r\nspirit was up. A less stanch spirit might have been subdued by such\r\nadverse influences; but the loan for her little outfit was in no part\r\nrepaid, and it had gone worse with her than she had foreseen, and she\r\nwas put upon proving her case and maintaining her independence.\r\n\r\nFaithful soul! When she had spoken to the Secretary of that \xe2\x80\x98deadness\r\nthat steals over me at times\xe2\x80\x99, her fortitude had made too little of it.\r\nOftener and ever oftener, it came stealing over her; darker and ever\r\ndarker, like the shadow of advancing Death. That the shadow should\r\nbe deep as it came on, like the shadow of an actual presence, was in\r\naccordance with the laws of the physical world, for all the Light that\r\nshone on Betty Higden lay beyond Death.\r\n\r\nThe poor old creature had taken the upward course of the river Thames as\r\nher general track; it was the track in which her last home lay, and of\r\nwhich she had last had local love and knowledge. She had hovered for a\r\nlittle while in the near neighbourhood of her abandoned dwelling, and\r\nhad sold, and knitted and sold, and gone on. In the pleasant towns of\r\nChertsey, Walton, Kingston, and Staines, her figure came to be quite\r\nwell known for some short weeks, and then again passed on.\r\n\r\nShe would take her stand in market-places, where there were such things,\r\non market days; at other times, in the busiest (that was seldom very\r\nbusy) portion of the little quiet High Street; at still other times she\r\nwould explore the outlying roads for great houses, and would ask leave\r\nat the Lodge to pass in with her basket, and would not often get it. But\r\nladies in carriages would frequently make purchases from her trifling\r\nstock, and were usually pleased with her bright eyes and her hopeful\r\nspeech. In these and her clean dress originated a fable that she was\r\nwell to do in the world: one might say, for her station, rich. As making\r\na comfortable provision for its subject which costs nobody anything,\r\nthis class of fable has long been popular.\r\n\r\nIn those pleasant little towns on Thames, you may hear the fall of\r\nthe water over the weirs, or even, in still weather, the rustle of the\r\nrushes; and from the bridge you may see the young river, dimpled like a\r\nyoung child, playfully gliding away among the trees, unpolluted by the\r\ndefilements that lie in wait for it on its course, and as yet out of\r\nhearing of the deep summons of the sea. It were too much to pretend that\r\nBetty Higden made out such thoughts; no; but she heard the tender river\r\nwhispering to many like herself, \xe2\x80\x98Come to me, come to me! When the cruel\r\nshame and terror you have so long fled from, most beset you, come to me!\r\nI am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work;\r\nI am not held in estimation according as I shirk it. My breast is softer\r\nthan the pauper-nurse\xe2\x80\x99s; death in my arms is peacefuller than among the\r\npauper-wards. Come to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was abundant place for gentler fancies too, in her untutored mind.\r\nThose gentlefolks and their children inside those fine houses, could\r\nthey think, as they looked out at her, what it was to be really hungry,\r\nreally cold? Did they feel any of the wonder about her, that she felt\r\nabout them? Bless the dear laughing children! If they could have seen\r\nsick Johnny in her arms, would they have cried for pity? If they could\r\nhave seen dead Johnny on that little bed, would they have understood it?\r\nBless the dear children for his sake, anyhow! So with the humbler houses\r\nin the little street, the inner firelight shining on the panes as the\r\nouter twilight darkened. When the families gathered in-doors there, for\r\nthe night, it was only a foolish fancy to feel as if it were a little\r\nhard in them to close the shutter and blacken the flame. So with the\r\nlighted shops, and speculations whether their masters and mistresses\r\ntaking tea in a perspective of back-parlour--not so far within but that\r\nthe flavour of tea and toast came out, mingled with the glow of light,\r\ninto the street--ate or drank or wore what they sold, with the greater\r\nrelish because they dealt in it. So with the churchyard on a branch of\r\nthe solitary way to the night\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping-place. \xe2\x80\x98Ah me! The dead and\r\nI seem to have it pretty much to ourselves in the dark and in this\r\nweather! But so much the better for all who are warmly housed at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe poor soul envied no one in bitterness, and grudged no one anything.\r\n\r\nBut, the old abhorrence grew stronger on her as she grew weaker, and\r\nit found more sustaining food than she did in her wanderings. Now, she\r\nwould light upon the shameful spectacle of some desolate creature--or\r\nsome wretched ragged groups of either sex, or of both sexes, with\r\nchildren among them, huddled together like the smaller vermin for\r\na little warmth--lingering and lingering on a doorstep, while the\r\nappointed evader of the public trust did his dirty office of trying to\r\nweary them out and so get rid of them. Now, she would light upon some\r\npoor decent person, like herself, going afoot on a pilgrimage of\r\nmany weary miles to see some worn-out relative or friend who had been\r\ncharitably clutched off to a great blank barren Union House, as far from\r\nold home as the County Jail (the remoteness of which is always its worst\r\npunishment for small rural offenders), and in its dietary, and in\r\nits lodging, and in its tending of the sick, a much more penal\r\nestablishment. Sometimes she would hear a newspaper read out, and would\r\nlearn how the Registrar General cast up the units that had within the\r\nlast week died of want and of exposure to the weather: for which that\r\nRecording Angel seemed to have a regular fixed place in his sum, as if\r\nthey were its halfpence. All such things she would hear discussed, as\r\nwe, my lords and gentlemen and honourable boards, in our unapproachable\r\nmagnificence never hear them, and from all such things she would fly\r\nwith the wings of raging Despair.\r\n\r\nThis is not to be received as a figure of speech. Old Betty Higden\r\nhowever tired, however footsore, would start up and be driven away\r\nby her awakened horror of falling into the hands of Charity. It is a\r\nremarkable Christian improvement, to have made a pursuing Fury of the\r\nGood Samaritan; but it was so in this case, and it is a type of many,\r\nmany, many.\r\n\r\nTwo incidents united to intensify the old unreasoning\r\nabhorrence--granted in a previous place to be unreasoning, because the\r\npeople always are unreasoning, and invariably make a point of producing\r\nall their smoke without fire.\r\n\r\nOne day she was sitting in a market-place on a bench outside an inn,\r\nwith her little wares for sale, when the deadness that she strove\r\nagainst came over her so heavily that the scene departed from before\r\nher eyes; when it returned, she found herself on the ground, her head\r\nsupported by some good-natured market-women, and a little crowd about\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you better now, mother?\xe2\x80\x99 asked one of the women. \xe2\x80\x98Do you think you\r\ncan do nicely now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I been ill then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked old Betty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have had a faint like,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer, \xe2\x80\x98or a fit. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-struggling, mother, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve been stiff and numbed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, recovering her memory. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the numbness. Yes. It\r\ncomes over me at times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWas it gone? the women asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s gone now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty. \xe2\x80\x98I shall be stronger than I was afore.\r\nMany thanks to ye, my dears, and when you come to be as old as I am, may\r\nothers do as much for you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey assisted her to rise, but she could not stand yet, and they\r\nsupported her when she sat down again upon the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My head\xe2\x80\x99s a bit light, and my feet are a bit heavy,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Betty,\r\nleaning her face drowsily on the breast of the woman who had spoken\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll both come nat\xe2\x80\x99ral in a minute. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask her,\xe2\x80\x99 said some farmers standing by, who had come out from their\r\nmarket-dinner, \xe2\x80\x98who belongs to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are there any folks belonging to you, mother?\xe2\x80\x99 said the woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes sure,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Betty. \xe2\x80\x98I heerd the gentleman say it, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer quick enough. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty belonging to me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ye\r\nfear for me, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But are any of \xe2\x80\x98em near here?\xe2\x80\x99 said the men\xe2\x80\x99s voices; the women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoices chiming in when it was said, and prolonging the strain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite near enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, rousing herself. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ye be afeard\r\nfor me, neighbours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are not fit to travel. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x99 was the next\r\ncompassionate chorus she heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a going to London when I\xe2\x80\x99ve sold out all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty, rising with\r\ndifficulty. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve right good friends in London. I want for nothing. I\r\nshall come to no harm. Thankye. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ye be afeard for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA well-meaning bystander, yellow-legginged and purple-faced, said\r\nhoarsely over his red comforter, as she rose to her feet, that she\r\n\xe2\x80\x98oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be let to go\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s love don\xe2\x80\x99t meddle with me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried old Betty, all her\r\nfears crowding on her. \xe2\x80\x98I am quite well now, and I must go this minute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe caught up her basket as she spoke and was making an unsteady rush\r\naway from them, when the same bystander checked her with his hand on\r\nher sleeve, and urged her to come with him and see the parish-doctor.\r\nStrengthening herself by the utmost exercise of her resolution, the poor\r\ntrembling creature shook him off, almost fiercely, and took to flight.\r\nNor did she feel safe until she had set a mile or two of by-road between\r\nherself and the marketplace, and had crept into a copse, like a hunted\r\nanimal, to hide and recover breath. Not until then for the first time\r\ndid she venture to recall how she had looked over her shoulder before\r\nturning out of the town, and had seen the sign of the White Lion hanging\r\nacross the road, and the fluttering market booths, and the old grey\r\nchurch, and the little crowd gazing after her but not attempting to\r\nfollow her.\r\n\r\nThe second frightening incident was this. She had been again as bad, and\r\nhad been for some days better, and was travelling along by a part of\r\nthe road where it touched the river, and in wet seasons was so often\r\noverflowed by it that there were tall white posts set up to mark the\r\nway. A barge was being towed towards her, and she sat down on the bank\r\nto rest and watch it. As the tow-rope was slackened by a turn of the\r\nstream and dipped into the water, such a confusion stole into her\r\nmind that she thought she saw the forms of her dead children and dead\r\ngrandchildren peopling the barge, and waving their hands to her in\r\nsolemn measure; then, as the rope tightened and came up, dropping\r\ndiamonds, it seemed to vibrate into two parallel ropes and strike her,\r\nwith a twang, though it was far off. When she looked again, there was no\r\nbarge, no river, no daylight, and a man whom she had never before seen\r\nheld a candle close to her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Missis,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98where did you come from and where are you going\r\nto?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe poor soul confusedly asked the counter-question where she was?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the Lock,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lock?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the Deputy Lock, on job, and this is the Lock-house. (Lock or\r\nDeputy Lock, it\xe2\x80\x99s all one, while the t\xe2\x80\x99other man\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital.)\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your Parish?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Parish!\xe2\x80\x99 She was up from the truckle-bed directly, wildly feeling about\r\nher for her basket, and gazing at him in affright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked the question down town,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man. \xe2\x80\x98They won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nyou be more than a Casual there. They\xe2\x80\x99ll pass you on to your settlement,\r\nMissis, with all speed. You\xe2\x80\x99re not in a state to be let come upon\r\nstrange parishes \xe2\x80\x98ceptin as a Casual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas the deadness again!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Betty Higden, with her hand to her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was the deadness, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have thought the deadness was a mild word for it, if it had\r\nbeen named to me when we brought you in. Have you got any friends,\r\nMissis?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best of friends, Master.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should recommend your looking \xe2\x80\x98em up if you consider \xe2\x80\x98em game to do\r\nanything for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Deputy Lock. \xe2\x80\x98Have you got any money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just a morsel of money, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you want to keep it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Deputy Lock, shrugging his shoulders with his\r\nhands in his pockets, and shaking his head in a sulkily ominous manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the parish authorities down town will have it out of you, if you go on,\r\nyou may take your Alfred David.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll make you pay, as fur as your money will go,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the\r\nDeputy, \xe2\x80\x98for your relief as a Casual and for your being passed to your\r\nParish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank ye kindly, Master, for your warning, thank ye for your shelter,\r\nand good night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Deputy, striking in between her and the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you all of a shake, and what\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry, Missis?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Master, Master,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Betty Higden, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve fought against the\r\nParish and fled from it, all my life, and I want to die free of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Deputy, with deliberation, \xe2\x80\x98as I ought to let\r\nyou go. I\xe2\x80\x99m a honest man as gets my living by the sweat of my brow, and\r\nI may fall into trouble by letting you go. I\xe2\x80\x99ve fell into trouble afore\r\nnow, by George, and I know what it is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s made me careful. You\r\nmight be took with your deadness again, half a mile off--or half of half\r\na quarter, for the matter of that--and then it would be asked, Why did\r\nthat there honest Deputy Lock, let her go, instead of putting her safe\r\nwith the Parish? That\xe2\x80\x99s what a man of his character ought to have done,\r\nit would be argueyfied,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Deputy Lock, cunningly harping on the\r\nstrong string of her terror; \xe2\x80\x98he ought to have handed her over safe to\r\nthe Parish. That was to be expected of a man of his merits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he stood in the doorway, the poor old careworn wayworn woman burst\r\ninto tears, and clasped her hands, as if in a very agony she prayed to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you, Master, I\xe2\x80\x99ve the best of friends. This letter will\r\nshow how true I spoke, and they will be thankful for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Lock opened the letter with a grave face, which underwent no\r\nchange as he eyed its contents. But it might have done, if he could have\r\nread them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What amount of small change, Missis,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with an abstracted air,\r\nafter a little meditation, \xe2\x80\x98might you call a morsel of money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHurriedly emptying her pocket, old Betty laid down on the table, a\r\nshilling, and two sixpenny pieces, and a few pence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I was to let you go instead of handing you over safe to the Parish,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Deputy, counting the money with his eyes, \xe2\x80\x98might it be your own\r\nfree wish to leave that there behind you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take it, Master, take it, and welcome and thankful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a man,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Deputy, giving her back the letter, and pocketing\r\nthe coins, one by one, \xe2\x80\x98as earns his living by the sweat of his brow;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhere he drew his sleeve across his forehead, as if this particular\r\nportion of his humble gains were the result of sheer hard labour and\r\nvirtuous industry; \xe2\x80\x98and I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand in your way. Go where you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was gone out of the Lock-house as soon as he gave her this\r\npermission, and her tottering steps were on the road again. But, afraid\r\nto go back and afraid to go forward; seeing what she fled from, in the\r\nsky-glare of the lights of the little town before her, and leaving a\r\nconfused horror of it everywhere behind her, as if she had escaped it\r\nin every stone of every market-place; she struck off by side ways, among\r\nwhich she got bewildered and lost. That night she took refuge from the\r\nSamaritan in his latest accredited form, under a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s rick; and\r\nif--worth thinking of, perhaps, my fellow-Christians--the Samaritan had\r\nin the lonely night, \xe2\x80\x98passed by on the other side\xe2\x80\x99, she would have most\r\ndevoutly thanked High Heaven for her escape from him.\r\n\r\nThe morning found her afoot again, but fast declining as to the\r\nclearness of her thoughts, though not as to the steadiness of her\r\npurpose. Comprehending that her strength was quitting her, and that the\r\nstruggle of her life was almost ended, she could neither reason out the\r\nmeans of getting back to her protectors, nor even form the idea. The\r\novermastering dread, and the proud stubborn resolution it engendered\r\nin her to die undegraded, were the two distinct impressions left in her\r\nfailing mind. Supported only by a sense that she was bent on conquering\r\nin her life-long fight, she went on.\r\n\r\nThe time was come, now, when the wants of this little life were passing\r\naway from her. She could not have swallowed food, though a table had\r\nbeen spread for her in the next field. The day was cold and wet, but\r\nshe scarcely knew it. She crept on, poor soul, like a criminal afraid of\r\nbeing taken, and felt little beyond the terror of falling down while it\r\nwas yet daylight, and being found alive. She had no fear that she would\r\nlive through another night.\r\n\r\nSewn in the breast of her gown, the money to pay for her burial was\r\nstill intact. If she could wear through the day, and then lie down to\r\ndie under cover of the darkness, she would die independent. If she were\r\ncaptured previously, the money would be taken from her as a pauper who\r\nhad no right to it, and she would be carried to the accursed workhouse.\r\nGaining her end, the letter would be found in her breast, along with\r\nthe money, and the gentlefolks would say when it was given back to them,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She prized it, did old Betty Higden; she was true to it; and while she\r\nlived, she would never let it be disgraced by falling into the hands\r\nof those that she held in horror.\xe2\x80\x99 Most illogical, inconsequential, and\r\nlight-headed, this; but travellers in the valley of the shadow of death\r\nare apt to be light-headed; and worn-out old people of low estate have\r\na trick of reasoning as indifferently as they live, and doubtless\r\nwould appreciate our Poor Law more philosophically on an income of ten\r\nthousand a year.\r\n\r\nSo, keeping to byways, and shunning human approach, this troublesome\r\nold woman hid herself, and fared on all through the dreary day. Yet so\r\nunlike was she to vagrant hiders in general, that sometimes, as the day\r\nadvanced, there was a bright fire in her eyes, and a quicker beating at\r\nher feeble heart, as though she said exultingly, \xe2\x80\x98The Lord will see me\r\nthrough it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy what visionary hands she was led along upon that journey of escape\r\nfrom the Samaritan; by what voices, hushed in the grave, she seemed\r\nto be addressed; how she fancied the dead child in her arms again, and\r\ntimes innumerable adjusted her shawl to keep it warm; what infinite\r\nvariety of forms of tower and roof and steeple the trees took; how many\r\nfurious horsemen rode at her, crying, \xe2\x80\x98There she goes! Stop! Stop,\r\nBetty Higden!\xe2\x80\x99 and melted away as they came close; be these things left\r\nuntold. Faring on and hiding, hiding and faring on, the poor harmless\r\ncreature, as though she were a Murderess and the whole country were up\r\nafter her, wore out the day, and gained the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Water-meadows, or such like,\xe2\x80\x99 she had sometimes murmured, on the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npilgrimage, when she had raised her head and taken any note of the real\r\nobjects about her. There now arose in the darkness, a great building,\r\nfull of lighted windows. Smoke was issuing from a high chimney in\r\nthe rear of it, and there was the sound of a water-wheel at the side.\r\nBetween her and the building, lay a piece of water, in which the lighted\r\nwindows were reflected, and on its nearest margin was a plantation of\r\ntrees. \xe2\x80\x98I humbly thank the Power and the Glory,\xe2\x80\x99 said Betty Higden,\r\nholding up her withered hands, \xe2\x80\x98that I have come to my journey\xe2\x80\x99s end!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe crept among the trees to the trunk of a tree whence she could see,\r\nbeyond some intervening trees and branches, the lighted windows, both in\r\ntheir reality and their reflection in the water. She placed her orderly\r\nlittle basket at her side, and sank upon the ground, supporting herself\r\nagainst the tree. It brought to her mind the foot of the Cross, and\r\nshe committed herself to Him who died upon it. Her strength held out to\r\nenable her to arrange the letter in her breast, so as that it could\r\nbe seen that she had a paper there. It had held out for this, and it\r\ndeparted when this was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am safe here,\xe2\x80\x99 was her last benumbed thought. \xe2\x80\x98When I am found dead\r\nat the foot of the Cross, it will be by some of my own sort; some of\r\nthe working people who work among the lights yonder. I cannot see the\r\nlighted windows now, but they are there. I am thankful for all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darkness gone, and a face bending down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It cannot be the boofer lady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you say. Let me wet your lips again with this\r\nbrandy. I have been away to fetch it. Did you think that I was long\r\ngone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is as the face of a woman, shaded by a quantity of rich dark hair.\r\nIt is the earnest face of a woman who is young and handsome. But all is\r\nover with me on earth, and this must be an Angel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I been long dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you say. Let me wet your lips again. I hurried\r\nall I could, and brought no one back with me, lest you should die of the\r\nshock of strangers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I not dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot understand what you say. Your voice is so low and broken that\r\nI cannot hear you. Do you hear me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean Yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was coming from my work just now, along the path outside (I was up\r\nwith the night-hands last night), and I heard a groan, and found you\r\nlying here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What work, deary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ask what work? At the paper-mill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your face is turned up to the sky, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t see it. It is close\r\nby. You can see my face, here, between you and the sky?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dare I lift you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not even lift your head to get it on my arm? I will do it by very\r\ngentle degrees. You shall hardly feel it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not yet. Paper. Letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This paper in your breast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless ye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me wet your lips again. Am I to open it? To read it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless ye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe reads it with surprise, and looks down with a new expression and an\r\nadded interest on the motionless face she kneels beside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know these names. I have heard them often.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you send it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot understand you. Let me wet your lips again, and your forehead.\r\nThere. O poor thing, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99 These words through her fast-dropping\r\ntears. \xe2\x80\x98What was it that you asked me? Wait till I bring my ear quite\r\nclose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you send it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will I send it to the writers? Is that your wish? Yes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll not give it up to any one but them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you must grow old in time, and come to your dying hour, my dear,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll not give it up to any one but them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Most solemnly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never to the Parish!\xe2\x80\x99 with a convulsed struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Most solemnly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor let the Parish touch me, not yet so much as look at me!\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nanother struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Faithfully.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA look of thankfulness and triumph lights the worn old face.\r\n\r\nThe eyes, which have been darkly fixed upon the sky, turn with meaning\r\nin them towards the compassionate face from which the tears are\r\ndropping, and a smile is on the aged lips as they ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is your name, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Lizzie Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must be sore disfigured. Are you afraid to kiss me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe answer is, the ready pressure of her lips upon the cold but smiling\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless ye! NOW lift me, my love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie Hexam very softly raised the weather-stained grey head, and\r\nlifted her as high as Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nSOMEBODY BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF A PREDICTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWe give thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleased thee to deliver\r\nthis our sister out of the miseries of this sinful world.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 So read the\r\nReverend Frank Milvey in a not untroubled voice, for his heart misgave\r\nhim that all was not quite right between us and our sister--or say our\r\nsister in Law--Poor Law--and that we sometimes read these words in an\r\nawful manner, over our Sister and our Brother too.\r\n\r\nAnd Sloppy--on whom the brave deceased had never turned her back until\r\nshe ran away from him, knowing that otherwise he would not be separated\r\nfrom her--Sloppy could not in his conscience as yet find the hearty\r\nthanks required of it. Selfish in Sloppy, and yet excusable, it may be\r\nhumbly hoped, because our sister had been more than his mother.\r\n\r\nThe words were read above the ashes of Betty Higden, in a corner of a\r\nchurchyard near the river; in a churchyard so obscure that there was\r\nnothing in it but grass-mounds, not so much as one single tombstone.\r\nIt might not be to do an unreasonably great deal for the diggers and\r\nhewers, in a registering age, if we ticketed their graves at the common\r\ncharge; so that a new generation might know which was which: so that the\r\nsoldier, sailor, emigrant, coming home, should be able to identify the\r\nresting-place of father, mother, playmate, or betrothed. For, we turn up\r\nour eyes and say that we are all alike in death, and we might turn\r\nthem down and work the saying out in this world, so far. It would\r\nbe sentimental, perhaps? But how say ye, my lords and gentleman and\r\nhonourable boards, shall we not find good standing-room left for a\r\nlittle sentiment, if we look into our crowds?\r\n\r\nNear unto the Reverend Frank Milvey as he read, stood his little wife,\r\nJohn Rokesmith the Secretary, and Bella Wilfer. These, over and above\r\nSloppy, were the mourners at the lowly grave. Not a penny had been\r\nadded to the money sewn in her dress: what her honest spirit had so long\r\nprojected, was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve took it in my head,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, laying it, inconsolable, against\r\nthe church door, when all was done: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve took it in my wretched head\r\nthat I might have sometimes turned a little harder for her, and it cuts\r\nme deep to think so now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Frank Milvey, comforting Sloppy, expounded to him how the\r\nbest of us were more or less remiss in our turnings at our respective\r\nMangles--some of us very much so--and how we were all a halting,\r\nfailing, feeble, and inconstant crew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98SHE warn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, taking this ghostly counsel rather ill,\r\nin behalf of his late benefactress. \xe2\x80\x98Let us speak for ourselves, sir.\r\nShe went through with whatever duty she had to do. She went through with\r\nme, she went through with the Minders, she went through with herself,\r\nshe went through with everythink. O Mrs Higden, Mrs Higden, you was a\r\nwoman and a mother and a mangler in a million million!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith those heartfelt words, Sloppy removed his dejected head from the\r\nchurch door, and took it back to the grave in the corner, and laid it\r\ndown there, and wept alone. \xe2\x80\x98Not a very poor grave,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Reverend\r\nFrank Milvey, brushing his hand across his eyes, \xe2\x80\x98when it has that\r\nhomely figure on it. Richer, I think, than it could be made by most of\r\nthe sculpture in Westminster Abbey!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey left him undisturbed, and passed out at the wicket-gate. The\r\nwater-wheel of the paper-mill was audible there, and seemed to have a\r\nsoftening influence on the bright wintry scene. They had arrived but a\r\nlittle while before, and Lizzie Hexam now told them the little she could\r\nadd to the letter in which she had enclosed Mr Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s letter and\r\nhad asked for their instructions. This was merely how she had heard the\r\ngroan, and what had afterwards passed, and how she had obtained leave\r\nfor the remains to be placed in that sweet, fresh, empty store-room of\r\nthe mill from which they had just accompanied them to the churchyard,\r\nand how the last requests had been religiously observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could not have done it all, or nearly all, of myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not have wanted the will; but I should not have had the power,\r\nwithout our managing partner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely not the Jew who received us?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey.\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 observed her husband in parenthesis, \xe2\x80\x98why not?\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The gentleman certainly is a Jew,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98and the lady, his\r\nwife, is a Jewess, and I was first brought to their notice by a Jew. But\r\nI think there cannot be kinder people in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But suppose they try to convert you!\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Mrs Milvey, bristling\r\nin her good little way, as a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To do what, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lizzie, with a modest smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To make you change your religion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey.\r\n\r\nLizzie shook her head, still smiling. \xe2\x80\x98They have never asked me what\r\nmy religion is. They asked me what my story was, and I told them. They\r\nasked me to be industrious and faithful, and I promised to be so.\r\nThey most willingly and cheerfully do their duty to all of us who are\r\nemployed here, and we try to do ours to them. Indeed they do much more\r\nthan their duty to us, for they are wonderfully mindful of us in many\r\nways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is easy to see you\xe2\x80\x99re a favourite, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Mrs Milvey,\r\nnot quite pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be very ungrateful in me to say I am not,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98for I have been already raised to a place of confidence here. But that\r\nmakes no difference in their following their own religion and leaving\r\nall of us to ours. They never talk of theirs to us, and they never talk\r\nof ours to us. If I was the last in the mill, it would be just the same.\r\nThey never asked me what religion that poor thing had followed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey, aside to the Reverend Frank, \xe2\x80\x98I wish you\r\nwould talk to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Reverend Frank aside to his good little wife, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthink I will leave it to somebody else. The circumstances are hardly\r\nfavourable. There are plenty of talkers going about, my love, and she\r\nwill soon find one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile this discourse was interchanging, both Bella and the Secretary\r\nobserved Lizzie Hexam with great attention. Brought face to face for the\r\nfirst time with the daughter of his supposed murderer, it was natural\r\nthat John Harmon should have his own secret reasons for a careful\r\nscrutiny of her countenance and manner. Bella knew that Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather had been falsely accused of the crime which had had so great an\r\ninfluence on her own life and fortunes; and her interest, though it had\r\nno secret springs, like that of the Secretary, was equally natural. Both\r\nhad expected to see something very different from the real Lizzie Hexam,\r\nand thus it fell out that she became the unconscious means of bringing\r\nthem together.\r\n\r\nFor, when they had walked on with her to the little house in the clean\r\nvillage by the paper-mill, where Lizzie had a lodging with an elderly\r\ncouple employed in the establishment, and when Mrs Milvey and Bella\r\nhad been up to see her room and had come down, the mill bell rang.\r\nThis called Lizzie away for the time, and left the Secretary and Bella\r\nstanding rather awkwardly in the small street; Mrs Milvey being engaged\r\nin pursuing the village children, and her investigations whether they\r\nwere in danger of becoming children of Israel; and the Reverend Frank\r\nbeing engaged--to say the truth--in evading that branch of his spiritual\r\nfunctions, and getting out of sight surreptitiously.\r\n\r\nBella at length said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we better talk about the commission we have undertaken, Mr\r\nRokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all means,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that we ARE both commissioned, or we\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t both be here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x99 was the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I proposed to come with Mr and Mrs Milvey,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs\r\nBoffin urged me to do so, in order that I might give her my small\r\nreport--it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth anything, Mr Rokesmith, except for it\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s--which indeed with you may be a fresh reason for it\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nworth nothing--of Lizzie Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98directed me to come for the same\r\npurpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs they spoke they were leaving the little street and emerging on the\r\nwooded landscape by the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think well of her, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bella, conscious of\r\nmaking all the advances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think highly of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so glad of that! Something quite refined in her beauty, is there\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her appearance is very striking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a shade of sadness upon her that is quite touching. At least\r\nI--I am not setting up my own poor opinion, you know, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Bella, excusing and explaining herself in a pretty shy way; \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nconsulting you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I noticed that sadness. I hope it may not,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary in\r\na lower voice, \xe2\x80\x98be the result of the false accusation which has been\r\nretracted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed on a little further without speaking, Bella, after\r\nstealing a glance or two at the Secretary, suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr Rokesmith, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard with me, don\xe2\x80\x99t be stern with me; be\r\nmagnanimous! I want to talk with you on equal terms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary as suddenly brightened, and returned: \xe2\x80\x98Upon my honour I\r\nhad no thought but for you. I forced myself to be constrained, lest you\r\nmight misinterpret my being more natural. There. It\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, holding out her little hand. \xe2\x80\x98Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the Secretary, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98Forgive ME!\xe2\x80\x99 For there were tears\r\nin her eyes, and they were prettier in his sight (though they smote him\r\non the heart rather reproachfully too) than any other glitter in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked a little further:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were going to speak to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, with the shadow so\r\nlong on him quite thrown off and cast away, \xe2\x80\x98about Lizzie Hexam. So was\r\nI going to speak to you, if I could have begun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now that you CAN begin, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, with a look as if she\r\nitalicized the word by putting one of her dimples under it, \xe2\x80\x98what were\r\nyou going to say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember, of course, that in her short letter to Mrs Boffin--short,\r\nbut containing everything to the purpose--she stipulated that either\r\nher name, or else her place of residence, must be kept strictly a secret\r\namong us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella nodded Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is my duty to find out why she made that stipulation. I have it in\r\ncharge from Mr Boffin to discover, and I am very desirous for myself to\r\ndiscover, whether that retracted accusation still leaves any stain upon\r\nher. I mean whether it places her at any disadvantage towards any one,\r\neven towards herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, nodding thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x98I understand. That seems wise,\r\nand considerate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may not have noticed, Miss Wilfer, that she has the same kind of\r\ninterest in you, that you have in her. Just as you are attracted by her\r\nbeaut--by her appearance and manner, she is attracted by yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I certainly have NOT noticed it,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, again italicizing\r\nwith the dimple, \xe2\x80\x98and I should have given her credit for--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary with a smile held up his hand, so plainly interposing \xe2\x80\x98not\r\nfor better taste\xe2\x80\x99, that Bella\xe2\x80\x99s colour deepened over the little piece of\r\ncoquetry she was checked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98if you would speak with her alone\r\nbefore we go away from here, I feel quite sure that a natural and easy\r\nconfidence would arise between you. Of course you would not be asked to\r\nbetray it; and of course you would not, if you were. But if you do not\r\nobject to put this question to her--to ascertain for us her own feeling\r\nin this one matter--you can do so at a far greater advantage than I or\r\nany else could. Mr Boffin is anxious on the subject. And I am,\xe2\x80\x99 added\r\nthe Secretary after a moment, \xe2\x80\x98for a special reason, very anxious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be happy, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, \xe2\x80\x98to be of the least\r\nuse; for I feel, after the serious scene of to-day, that I am useless\r\nenough in this world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but I mean that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, raising her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one is useless in this world,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98who lightens\r\nthe burden of it for any one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I assure you I DON\xe2\x80\x99T, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, half-crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not for your father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, loving, self-forgetting, easily-satisfied Pa! Oh, yes! He thinks\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is enough if he only thinks so,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary. \xe2\x80\x98Excuse the\r\ninterruption: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear you depreciate yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But YOU once depreciated ME, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bella, pouting, \xe2\x80\x98and I hope\r\nyou may be satisfied with the consequences you brought upon your head!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHowever, she said nothing to that purpose; she even said something to a\r\ndifferent purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith, it seems so long since we spoke together naturally, that\r\nI am embarrassed in approaching another subject. Mr Boffin. You know I\r\nam very grateful to him; don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You know I feel a true respect for\r\nhim, and am bound to him by the strong ties of his own generosity; now\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unquestionably. And also that you are his favourite companion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That makes it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98so very difficult to speak of him. But--.\r\nDoes he treat you well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see how he treats me,\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary answered, with a patient and\r\nyet proud air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and I see it with pain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, very energetically.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary gave her such a radiant look, that if he had thanked her a\r\nhundred times, he could not have said as much as the look said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see it with pain,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bella, \xe2\x80\x98and it often makes me miserable.\r\nMiserable, because I cannot bear to be supposed to approve of it, or\r\nhave any indirect share in it. Miserable, because I cannot bear to be\r\nforced to admit to myself that Fortune is spoiling Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, with a beaming face, \xe2\x80\x98if you could\r\nknow with what delight I make the discovery that Fortune isn\xe2\x80\x99t spoiling\r\nYOU, you would know that it more than compensates me for any slight at\r\nany other hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of ME,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, giving herself an impatient little\r\nslap with her glove. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know me as well as--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you know yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested the Secretary, finding that she\r\nstopped. \xe2\x80\x98DO you know yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know quite enough of myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with a charming air of\r\nbeing inclined to give herself up as a bad job, \xe2\x80\x98and I don\xe2\x80\x99t improve\r\nupon acquaintance. But Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s manner to me, or consideration for me, is not what it\r\nused to be,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98must be admitted. It is too plain\r\nto be denied.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you disposed to deny it, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, with a look of\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ought I not to be glad to do so, if I could: though it were only for my\r\nown sake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Truly,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, \xe2\x80\x98it must try you very much, and--you must\r\nplease promise me that you won\xe2\x80\x99t take ill what I am going to add, Mr\r\nRokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promise it with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--And it must sometimes, I should think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, hesitating, \xe2\x80\x98a\r\nlittle lower you in your own estimation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAssenting with a movement of his head, though not at all looking as if\r\nit did, the Secretary replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have very strong reasons, Miss Wilfer, for bearing with the drawbacks\r\nof my position in the house we both inhabit. Believe that they are not\r\nall mercenary, although I have, through a series of strange fatalities,\r\nfaded out of my place in life. If what you see with such a gracious\r\nand good sympathy is calculated to rouse my pride, there are other\r\nconsiderations (and those you do not see) urging me to quiet endurance.\r\nThe latter are by far the stronger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I have noticed, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, looking at him with\r\ncuriosity, as not quite making him out, \xe2\x80\x98that you repress yourself, and\r\nforce yourself, to act a passive part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are right. I repress myself and force myself to act a part. It is\r\nnot in tameness of spirit that I submit. I have a settled purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a good one, I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a good one, I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, looking steadily at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes I have fancied, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, turning away her eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that your great regard for Mrs Boffin is a very powerful motive with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are right again; it is. I would do anything for her, bear anything\r\nfor her. There are no words to express how I esteem that good, good\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I do too! May I ask you one thing more, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you see that she really suffers, when Mr Boffin shows how he\r\nis changing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see it, every day, as you see it, and am grieved to give her pain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To give her pain?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, repeating the phrase quickly, with her\r\neyebrows raised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am generally the unfortunate cause of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps she says to you, as she often says to me, that he is the best\r\nof men, in spite of all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I often overhear her, in her honest and beautiful devotion to him,\r\nsaying so to you,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary, with the same steady look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I cannot assert that she ever says so to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella met the steady look for a moment with a wistful, musing little\r\nlook of her own, and then, nodding her pretty head several times, like\r\na dimpled philosopher (of the very best school) who was moralizing on\r\nLife, heaved a little sigh, and gave up things in general for a bad job,\r\nas she had previously been inclined to give up herself.\r\n\r\nBut, for all that, they had a very pleasant walk. The trees were bare of\r\nleaves, and the river was bare of water-lilies; but the sky was not bare\r\nof its beautiful blue, and the water reflected it, and a delicious\r\nwind ran with the stream, touching the surface crisply. Perhaps the old\r\nmirror was never yet made by human hands, which, if all the images it\r\nhas in its time reflected could pass across its surface again, would\r\nfail to reveal some scene of horror or distress. But the great serene\r\nmirror of the river seemed as if it might have reproduced all it had\r\never reflected between those placid banks, and brought nothing to the\r\nlight save what was peaceful, pastoral, and blooming.\r\n\r\nSo, they walked, speaking of the newly filled-up grave, and of Johnny,\r\nand of many things. So, on their return, they met brisk Mrs Milvey\r\ncoming to seek them, with the agreeable intelligence that there was no\r\nfear for the village children, there being a Christian school in the\r\nvillage, and no worse Judaical interference with it than to plant its\r\ngarden. So, they got back to the village as Lizzie Hexam was coming from\r\nthe paper-mill, and Bella detached herself to speak with her in her own\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid it is a poor room for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, with a smile of\r\nwelcome, as she offered the post of honour by the fireside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so poor as you think, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, \xe2\x80\x98if you knew all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIndeed, though attained by some wonderful winding narrow stairs, which\r\nseemed to have been erected in a pure white chimney, and though very low\r\nin the ceiling, and very rugged in the floor, and rather blinking as\r\nto the proportions of its lattice window, it was a pleasanter room than\r\nthat despised chamber once at home, in which Bella had first bemoaned\r\nthe miseries of taking lodgers.\r\n\r\nThe day was closing as the two girls looked at one another by the\r\nfireside. The dusky room was lighted by the fire. The grate might have\r\nbeen the old brazier, and the glow might have been the old hollow down\r\nby the flare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite new to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98to be visited by a lady so nearly\r\nof my own age, and so pretty, as you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to me to look at\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have nothing left to begin with,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, blushing, \xe2\x80\x98because\r\nI was going to say that it was a pleasure to me to look at you, Lizzie.\r\nBut we can begin without a beginning, can\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie took the pretty little hand that was held out in as pretty a\r\nlittle frankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, drawing her chair a little nearer, and taking\r\nLizzie\xe2\x80\x99s arm as if they were going out for a walk, \xe2\x80\x98I am commissioned\r\nwith something to say, and I dare say I shall say it wrong, but I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t if I can help it. It is in reference to your letter to Mr and Mrs\r\nBoffin, and this is what it is. Let me see. Oh yes! This is what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this exordium, Bella set forth that request of Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s touching\r\nsecrecy, and delicately spoke of that false accusation and its\r\nretraction, and asked might she beg to be informed whether it had any\r\nbearing, near or remote, on such request. \xe2\x80\x98I feel, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella,\r\nquite amazing herself by the business-like manner in which she was\r\ngetting on, \xe2\x80\x98that the subject must be a painful one to you, but I\r\nam mixed up in it also; for--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you may know it or\r\nsuspect it--I am the willed-away girl who was to have been married to\r\nthe unfortunate gentleman, if he had been pleased to approve of me. So\r\nI was dragged into the subject without my consent, and you were dragged\r\ninto it without your consent, and there is very little to choose between\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98that you were the Miss Wilfer I have\r\noften heard named. Can you tell me who my unknown friend is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unknown friend, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who caused the charge against poor father to be contradicted, and sent\r\nme the written paper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella had never heard of him. Had no notion who he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have been glad to thank him,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x98He has done a\r\ngreat deal for me. I must hope that he will let me thank him some day.\r\nYou asked me has it anything to do--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It or the accusation itself,\xe2\x80\x99 Bella put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Has either anything to do with my wishing to live quite secret and\r\nretired here? No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Lizzie Hexam shook her head in giving this reply and as her glance\r\nsought the fire, there was a quiet resolution in her folded hands, not\r\nlost on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you lived much alone?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new to me. I used to be always alone many hours\r\ntogether, in the day and in the night, when poor father was alive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have a brother, I have been told?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have a brother, but he is not friendly with me. He is a very good\r\nboy though, and has raised himself by his industry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she said it, with her eyes upon the fire-glow, there was an\r\ninstantaneous escape of distress into her face. Bella seized the moment\r\nto touch her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie, I wish you would tell me whether you have any friend of your\r\nown sex and age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have lived that lonely kind of life, that I have never had one,\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor I neither,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98Not that my life has been lonely, for I\r\ncould have sometimes wished it lonelier, instead of having Ma going on\r\nlike the Tragic Muse with a face-ache in majestic corners, and Lavvy\r\nbeing spiteful--though of course I am very fond of them both. I wish\r\nyou could make a friend of me, Lizzie. Do you think you could? I have\r\nno more of what they call character, my dear, than a canary-bird, but I\r\nknow I am trustworthy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wayward, playful, affectionate nature, giddy for want of the\r\nweight of some sustaining purpose, and capricious because it was always\r\nfluttering among little things, was yet a captivating one. To Lizzie it\r\nwas so new, so pretty, at once so womanly and so childish, that it won\r\nher completely. And when Bella said again, \xe2\x80\x98Do you think you could,\r\nLizzie?\xe2\x80\x99 with her eyebrows raised, her head inquiringly on one side,\r\nand an odd doubt about it in her own bosom, Lizzie showed beyond all\r\nquestion that she thought she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98what is the matter, and why you live\r\nlike this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie presently began, by way of prelude, \xe2\x80\x98You must have many lovers--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhen Bella checked her with a little scream of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! Perhaps one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I HAD one, but\r\nwhat he may think about it at the present time I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. Perhaps I\r\nhave half a one (of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t count that Idiot, George Sampson).\r\nHowever, never mind me. I want to hear about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a certain man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98a passionate and angry man, who\r\nsays he loves me, and who I must believe does love me. He is the friend\r\nof my brother. I shrank from him within myself when my brother first\r\nbrought him to me; but the last time I saw him he terrified me more than\r\nI can say.\xe2\x80\x99 There she stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you come here to escape from him, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I came here immediately after he so alarmed me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you afraid of him here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not timid generally, but I am always afraid of him. I am afraid\r\nto see a newspaper, or to hear a word spoken of what is done in London,\r\nlest he should have done some violence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you are not afraid of him for yourself, dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, after\r\npondering on the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be even that, if I met him about here. I look round for him\r\nalways, as I pass to and fro at night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you afraid of anything he may do to himself in London, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. He might be fierce enough even to do some violence to himself, but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it would almost seem, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella quaintly, \xe2\x80\x98as if there\r\nmust be somebody else?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie put her hands before her face for a moment before replying: \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nwords are always in my ears, and the blow he struck upon a stone wall as\r\nhe said them is always before my eyes. I have tried hard to think it\r\nnot worth remembering, but I cannot make so little of it. His hand was\r\ntrickling down with blood as he said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope that I may\r\nnever kill him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRather startled, Bella made and clasped a girdle of her arms round\r\nLizzie\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and then asked quietly, in a soft voice, as they both\r\nlooked at the fire:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kill him! Is this man so jealous, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x98--I hardly know how to tell you--of a\r\ngentleman far above me and my way of life, who broke father\xe2\x80\x99s death to\r\nme, and has shown an interest in me since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does he love you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does he admire you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie ceased to shake her head, and pressed her hand upon her living\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it through his influence that you came here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no! And of all the world I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him know that I am here, or\r\nget the least clue where to find me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie, dear! Why?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, in amazement at this burst. But then\r\nquickly added, reading Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s face: \xe2\x80\x98No. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say why. That was a\r\nfoolish question of mine. I see, I see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was silence between them. Lizzie, with a drooping head, glanced\r\ndown at the glow in the fire where her first fancies had been nursed,\r\nand her first escape made from the grim life out of which she had\r\nplucked her brother, foreseeing her reward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know all now,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, raising her eyes to Bella\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x98There is\r\nnothing left out. This is my reason for living secret here, with the aid\r\nof a good old man who is my true friend. For a short part of my life\r\nat home with father, I knew of things--don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me what--that I set my\r\nface against, and tried to better. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could have done more,\r\nthen, without letting my hold on father go; but they sometimes lie heavy\r\non my mind. By doing all for the best, I hope I may wear them out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And wear out too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella soothingly, \xe2\x80\x98this weakness, Lizzie, in\r\nfavour of one who is not worthy of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wear that out,\xe2\x80\x99 was the flushed reply, \xe2\x80\x98nor do I\r\nwant to believe, nor do I believe, that he is not worthy of it. What\r\nshould I gain by that, and how much should I lose!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s expressive little eyebrows remonstrated with the fire for some\r\nshort time before she rejoined:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I press you, Lizzie; but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you gain in peace,\r\nand hope, and even in freedom? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better not to live a\r\nsecret life in hiding, and not to be shut out from your natural and\r\nwholesome prospects? Forgive my asking you, would that be no gain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart that--that has that weakness in it which you have\r\nspoken of,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98seek to gain anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe question was so directly at variance with Bella\xe2\x80\x99s views in life, as\r\nset forth to her father, that she said internally, \xe2\x80\x98There, you little\r\nmercenary wretch! Do you hear that? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of your self?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand unclasped the girdle of her arms, expressly to give herself a\r\npenitential poke in the side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you said, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bella, returning to her subject when\r\nshe had administered this chastisement, \xe2\x80\x98that you would lose, besides.\r\nWould you mind telling me what you would lose, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should lose some of the best recollections, best encouragements,\r\nand best objects, that I carry through my daily life. I should lose my\r\nbelief that if I had been his equal, and he had loved me, I should have\r\ntried with all my might to make him better and happier, as he would have\r\nmade me. I should lose almost all the value that I put upon the little\r\nlearning I have, which is all owing to him, and which I conquered the\r\ndifficulties of, that he might not think it thrown away upon me. I\r\nshould lose a kind of picture of him--or of what he might have been,\r\nif I had been a lady, and he had loved me--which is always with me, and\r\nwhich I somehow feel that I could not do a mean or a wrong thing before.\r\nI should leave off prizing the remembrance that he has done me nothing\r\nbut good since I have known him, and that he has made a change within\r\nme, like--like the change in the grain of these hands, which were\r\ncoarse, and cracked, and hard, and brown when I rowed on the river with\r\nfather, and are softened and made supple by this new work as you see\r\nthem now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey trembled, but with no weakness, as she showed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Understand me, my dear;\xe2\x80\x99 thus she went on. \xe2\x80\x98I have never dreamed of\r\nthe possibility of his being anything to me on this earth but the\r\nkind picture that I know I could not make you understand, if the\r\nunderstanding was not in your own breast already. I have no more dreamed\r\nof the possibility of MY being his wife, than he ever has--and words\r\ncould not be stronger than that. And yet I love him. I love him so much,\r\nand so dearly, that when I sometimes think my life may be but a weary\r\none, I am proud of it and glad of it. I am proud and glad to suffer\r\nsomething for him, even though it is of no service to him, and he will\r\nnever know of it or care for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella sat enchained by the deep, unselfish passion of this girl or woman\r\nof her own age, courageously revealing itself in the confidence of her\r\nsympathetic perception of its truth. And yet she had never experienced\r\nanything like it, or thought of the existence of anything like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was late upon a wretched night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98when his eyes first\r\nlooked at me in my old river-side home, very different from this. His\r\neyes may never look at me again. I would rather that they never did; I\r\nhope that they never may. But I would not have the light of them taken\r\nout of my life, for anything my life can give me. I have told you\r\neverything now, my dear. If it comes a little strange to me to have\r\nparted with it, I am not sorry. I had no thought of ever parting with a\r\nsingle word of it, a moment before you came in; but you came in, and my\r\nmind changed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella kissed her on the cheek, and thanked her warmly for her\r\nconfidence. \xe2\x80\x98I only wish,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98I was more deserving of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More deserving of it?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Lizzie, with an incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in respect of keeping it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98because any\r\none should tear me to bits before getting at a syllable of it--though\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no merit in that, for I am naturally as obstinate as a Pig. What\r\nI mean is, Lizzie, that I am a mere impertinent piece of conceit, and\r\nyou shame me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie put up the pretty brown hair that came tumbling down, owing to\r\nthe energy with which Bella shook her head; and she remonstrated while\r\nthus engaged, \xe2\x80\x98My dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to call me your dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with a\r\npettish whimper, \xe2\x80\x98and I am glad to be called so, though I have slight\r\nenough claim to be. But I AM such a nasty little thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear!\xe2\x80\x99 urged Lizzie again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such a shallow, cold, worldly, Limited little brute!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella,\r\nbringing out her last adjective with culminating force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Lizzie with her quiet smile, the hair being now\r\nsecured, \xe2\x80\x98that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DO you know better though?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98Do you really believe you know\r\nbetter? Oh, I should be so glad if you did know better, but I am so very\r\nmuch afraid that I must know best!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLizzie asked her, laughing outright, whether she ever saw her own face\r\nor heard her own voice?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella; \xe2\x80\x98I look in the glass often enough, and I\r\nchatter like a Magpie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen your face, and heard your voice, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and they have tempted me to say to you--with a certainty of not going\r\nwrong--what I thought I should never say to any one. Does that look\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 pouted Bella, stopping herself in something\r\nbetween a humoured laugh and a humoured sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used once to see pictures in the fire,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie playfully, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nplease my brother. Shall I tell you what I see down there where the fire\r\nis glowing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had risen, and were standing on the hearth, the time being come for\r\nseparating; each had drawn an arm around the other to take leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lizzie, \xe2\x80\x98what I see down there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Limited little b?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella with her eyebrows raised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A heart well worth winning, and well won. A heart that, once won, goes\r\nthrough fire and water for the winner, and never changes, and is never\r\ndaunted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Girl\xe2\x80\x99s heart?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, with accompanying eyebrows.\r\n\r\nLizzie nodded. \xe2\x80\x98And the figure to which it belongs--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is yours,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Most clearly and distinctly yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the interview terminated with pleasant words on both sides, and with\r\nmany reminders on the part of Bella that they were friends, and pledges\r\nthat she would soon come down into that part of the country again. There\r\nwith Lizzie returned to her occupation, and Bella ran over to the little\r\ninn to rejoin her company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look rather serious, Miss Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 was the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel rather serious,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wilfer.\r\n\r\nShe had nothing else to tell him but that Lizzie Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s secret had\r\nno reference whatever to the cruel charge, or its withdrawal. Oh yes\r\nthough! said Bella; she might as well mention one other thing; Lizzie\r\nwas very desirous to thank her unknown friend who had sent her the\r\nwritten retractation. Was she, indeed? observed the Secretary. Ah! Bella\r\nasked him, had he any notion who that unknown friend might be? He had no\r\nnotion whatever.\r\n\r\nThey were on the borders of Oxfordshire, so far had poor old Betty\r\nHigden strayed. They were to return by the train presently, and, the\r\nstation being near at hand, the Reverend Frank and Mrs Frank, and Sloppy\r\nand Bella and the Secretary, set out to walk to it. Few rustic paths are\r\nwide enough for five, and Bella and the Secretary dropped behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you believe, Mr Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that I feel as if whole\r\nyears had passed since I went into Lizzie Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s cottage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have crowded a good deal into the day,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, \xe2\x80\x98and you were\r\nmuch affected in the churchyard. You are over-tired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I am not at all tired. I have not quite expressed what I mean. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I feel as if a great space of time had gone by, but that\r\nI feel as if much had happened--to myself, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For good, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are cold; I felt you tremble. Pray let me put this wrapper of mine\r\nabout you. May I fold it over this shoulder without injuring your dress?\r\nNow, it will be too heavy and too long. Let me carry this end over my\r\narm, as you have no arm to give me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes she had though. How she got it out, in her muffled state, Heaven\r\nknows; but she got it out somehow--there it was--and slipped it through\r\nthe Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had a long and interesting talk with Lizzie, Mr Rokesmith, and\r\nshe gave me her full confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She could not withhold it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder how you come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, stopping short as she glanced at\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98to say to me just what she said about it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I infer that it must be because I feel just as she felt about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how was that, do you mean to say, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, moving again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That if you were inclined to win her confidence--anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence--you were sure to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe railway, at this point, knowingly shutting a green eye and opening\r\na red one, they had to run for it. As Bella could not run easily so\r\nwrapped up, the Secretary had to help her. When she took her opposite\r\nplace in the carriage corner, the brightness in her face was so charming\r\nto behold, that on her exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98What beautiful stars and what a\r\nglorious night!\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary said \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 but seemed to prefer to see\r\nthe night and the stars in the light of her lovely little countenance,\r\nto looking out of window.\r\n\r\nO boofer lady, fascinating boofer lady! If I were but legally executor\r\nof Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s will! If I had but the right to pay your legacy and to take\r\nyour receipt!--Something to this purpose surely mingled with the blast\r\nof the train as it cleared the stations, all knowingly shutting up their\r\ngreen eyes and opening their red ones when they prepared to let the\r\nboofer lady pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nSCOUTS OUT\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so, Miss Wren,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Eugene Wrayburn, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot persuade you to\r\ndress me a doll?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren snappishly; \xe2\x80\x98if you want one, go and buy one at\r\nthe shop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And my charming young goddaughter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wrayburn plaintively, \xe2\x80\x98down\r\nin Hertfordshire--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Humbugshire you mean, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Miss Wren.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--is to be put upon the cold footing of the general public, and is\r\nto derive no advantage from my private acquaintance with the Court\r\nDressmaker?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it\xe2\x80\x99s any advantage to your charming godchild--and oh, a precious\r\ngodfather she has got!\xe2\x80\x99--replied Miss Wren, pricking at him in the air\r\nwith her needle, \xe2\x80\x98to be informed that the Court Dressmaker knows\r\nyour tricks and your manners, you may tell her so by post, with my\r\ncompliments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Wren was busy at her work by candle-light, and Mr Wrayburn, half\r\namused and half vexed, and all idle and shiftless, stood by her bench\r\nlooking on. Miss Wren\xe2\x80\x99s troublesome child was in the corner in deep\r\ndisgrace, and exhibiting great wretchedness in the shivering stage of\r\nprostration from drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ugh, you disgraceful boy!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren, attracted by the sound\r\nof his chattering teeth, \xe2\x80\x98I wish they\xe2\x80\x99d all drop down your throat and\r\nplay at dice in your stomach! Boh, wicked child! Bee-baa, black sheep!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn her accompanying each of these reproaches with a threatening stamp of\r\nthe foot, the wretched creature protested with a whine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pay five shillings for you indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Wren proceeded; \xe2\x80\x98how many\r\nhours do you suppose it costs me to earn five shillings, you infamous\r\nboy?--Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry like that, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw a doll at you. Pay five\r\nshillings fine for you indeed. Fine in more ways than one, I think! I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive the dustman five shillings, to carry you off in the dust cart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 pleaded the absurd creature. \xe2\x80\x98Please!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s enough to break his mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart, is this boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren,\r\nhalf appealing to Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98I wish I had never brought him up. He\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nsharper than a serpent\xe2\x80\x99s tooth, if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as dull as ditch water.\r\nLook at him. There\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty object for a parent\xe2\x80\x99s eyes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAssuredly, in his worse than swinish state (for swine at least fatten on\r\ntheir guzzling, and make themselves good to eat), he was a pretty object\r\nfor any eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A muddling and a swipey old child,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, rating him with\r\ngreat severity, \xe2\x80\x98fit for nothing but to be preserved in the liquor\r\nthat destroys him, and put in a great glass bottle as a sight for other\r\nswipey children of his own pattern,--if he has no consideration for his\r\nliver, has he none for his mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Deration, oh don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the subject of these angry remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh don\xe2\x80\x99t and oh don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s oh do and oh do. And\r\nwhy do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t do so any more. Won\xe2\x80\x99t indeed. Pray!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, covering her eyes with her hand. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear to look at you. Go up stairs and get me my bonnet and shawl. Make\r\nyourself useful in some way, bad boy, and let me have your room instead\r\nof your company, for one half minute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nObeying her, he shambled out, and Eugene Wrayburn saw the tears exude\r\nfrom between the little creature\xe2\x80\x99s fingers as she kept her hand before\r\nher eyes. He was sorry, but his sympathy did not move his carelessness\r\nto do anything but feel sorry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Italian Opera to try on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, taking away\r\nher hand after a little while, and laughing satirically to hide that she\r\nhad been crying; \xe2\x80\x98I must see your back before I go, Mr Wrayburn. Let me\r\nfirst tell you, once for all, that it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use your paying visits\r\nto me. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get what you want, of me, no, not if you brought\r\npincers with you to tear it out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you so obstinate on the subject of a doll\xe2\x80\x99s dress for my godchild?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren with a hitch of her chin, \xe2\x80\x98I am so\r\nobstinate. And of course it\xe2\x80\x99s on the subject of a doll\xe2\x80\x99s dress--or\r\nADdress--whichever you like. Get along and give it up!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer degraded charge had come back, and was standing behind her with the\r\nbonnet and shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give \xe2\x80\x98em to me and get back into your corner, you naughty old thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Miss Wren, as she turned and espied him. \xe2\x80\x98No, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have your\r\nhelp. Go into your corner, this minute!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe miserable man, feebly rubbing the back of his faltering hands\r\ndownward from the wrists, shuffled on to his post of disgrace; but not\r\nwithout a curious glance at Eugene in passing him, accompanied with what\r\nseemed as if it might have been an action of his elbow, if any action of\r\nany limb or joint he had, would have answered truly to his will. Taking\r\nno more particular notice of him than instinctively falling away from\r\nthe disagreeable contact, Eugene, with a lazy compliment or so to Miss\r\nWren, begged leave to light his cigar, and departed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you prodigal old son,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny, shaking her head and her\r\nemphatic little forefinger at her burden, \xe2\x80\x98you sit there till I come\r\nback. You dare to move out of your corner for a single instant while I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngone, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll know the reason why.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this admonition, she blew her work candles out, leaving him to the\r\nlight of the fire, and, taking her big door-key in her pocket and her\r\ncrutch-stick in her hand, marched off.\r\n\r\nEugene lounged slowly towards the Temple, smoking his cigar, but saw\r\nno more of the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, through the accident of their taking\r\nopposite sides of the street. He lounged along moodily, and stopped at\r\nCharing Cross to look about him, with as little interest in the crowd\r\nas any man might take, and was lounging on again, when a most unexpected\r\nobject caught his eyes. No less an object than Jenny Wren\xe2\x80\x99s bad boy\r\ntrying to make up his mind to cross the road.\r\n\r\nA more ridiculous and feeble spectacle than this tottering wretch making\r\nunsteady sallies into the roadway, and as often staggering back again,\r\noppressed by terrors of vehicles that were a long way off or were\r\nnowhere, the streets could not have shown. Over and over again, when the\r\ncourse was perfectly clear, he set out, got half way, described a loop,\r\nturned, and went back again; when he might have crossed and re-crossed\r\nhalf a dozen times. Then, he would stand shivering on the edge of the\r\npavement, looking up the street and looking down, while scores of people\r\njostled him, and crossed, and went on. Stimulated in course of time\r\nby the sight of so many successes, he would make another sally, make\r\nanother loop, would all but have his foot on the opposite pavement,\r\nwould see or imagine something coming, and would stagger back again.\r\nThere, he would stand making spasmodic preparations as if for a great\r\nleap, and at last would decide on a start at precisely the wrong moment,\r\nand would be roared at by drivers, and would shrink back once more, and\r\nstand in the old spot shivering, with the whole of the proceedings to go\r\nthrough again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It strikes me,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene coolly, after watching him for some\r\nminutes, \xe2\x80\x98that my friend is likely to be rather behind time if he has\r\nany appointment on hand.\xe2\x80\x99 With which remark he strolled on, and took no\r\nfurther thought of him.\r\n\r\nLightwood was at home when he got to the Chambers, and had dined alone\r\nthere. Eugene drew a chair to the fire by which he was having his wine\r\nand reading the evening paper, and brought a glass, and filled it for\r\ngood fellowship\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mortimer, you are the express picture of contented industry,\r\nreposing (on credit) after the virtuous labours of the day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Eugene, you are the express picture of discontented idleness\r\nnot reposing at all. Where have you been?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wrayburn, \xe2\x80\x98--about town. I have turned up at the\r\npresent juncture, with the intention of consulting my highly intelligent\r\nand respected solicitor on the position of my affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your highly intelligent and respect solicitor is of opinion that your\r\naffairs are in a bad way, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Though whether,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x98that can be intelligently\r\nsaid, now, of the affairs of a client who has nothing to lose and who\r\ncannot possibly be made to pay, may be open to question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have fallen into the hands of the Jews, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear boy,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the debtor, very composedly taking up his glass,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98having previously fallen into the hands of some of the Christians, I\r\ncan bear it with philosophy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had an interview to-day, Eugene, with a Jew, who seems\r\ndetermined to press us hard. Quite a Shylock, and quite a Patriarch. A\r\npicturesque grey-headed and grey-bearded old Jew, in a shovel-hat and\r\ngaberdine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, pausing in setting down his glass, \xe2\x80\x98surely not my\r\nworthy friend Mr Aaron?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He calls himself Mr Riah.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By-the-by,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98it comes into my mind that--no doubt with an\r\ninstinctive desire to receive him into the bosom of our Church--I gave\r\nhim the name of Aaron!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98you are more ridiculous than\r\nusual. Say what you mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Merely, my dear fellow, that I have the honour and pleasure of a\r\nspeaking acquaintance with such a Patriarch as you describe, and that I\r\naddress him as Mr Aaron, because it appears to me Hebraic, expressive,\r\nappropriate, and complimentary. Notwithstanding which strong reasons for\r\nits being his name, it may not be his name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe you are the absurdest man on the face of the earth,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLightwood, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, I assure you. Did he mention that he knew me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did not. He only said of you that he expected to be paid by you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which looks,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene with much gravity, \xe2\x80\x98like NOT knowing me.\r\nI hope it may not be my worthy friend Mr Aaron, for, to tell you the\r\ntruth, Mortimer, I doubt he may have a prepossession against me. I\r\nstrongly suspect him of having had a hand in spiriting away Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lightwood impatiently, \xe2\x80\x98seems, by a fatality,\r\nto bring us round to Lizzie. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout town\xe2\x80\x9d meant about Lizzie, just now,\r\nEugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My solicitor, do you know,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Eugene, turning round to the\r\nfurniture, \xe2\x80\x98is a man of infinite discernment!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did it not, Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes it did, Mortimer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet, Eugene, you know you do not really care for her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene Wrayburn rose, and put his hands in his pockets, and stood with a\r\nfoot on the fender, indolently rocking his body and looking at the fire.\r\nAfter a prolonged pause, he replied: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. I must ask you\r\nnot to say that, as if we took it for granted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if you do care for her, so much the more should you leave her to\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving again paused as before, Eugene said: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, either.\r\nBut tell me. Did you ever see me take so much trouble about anything, as\r\nabout this disappearance of hers? I ask, for information.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Eugene, I wish I ever had!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you have not? Just so. You confirm my own impression. Does that\r\nlook as if I cared for her? I ask, for information.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I asked YOU for information, Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear boy, I know it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t give it. I thirst for information.\r\nWhat do I mean? If my taking so much trouble to recover her does not\r\nmean that I care for her, what does it mean? \xe2\x80\x9cIf Peter Piper picked a\r\npeck of pickled pepper, where\xe2\x80\x99s the peck,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThough he said this gaily, he said it with a perplexed and inquisitive\r\nface, as if he actually did not know what to make of himself. \xe2\x80\x98Look on\r\nto the end--\xe2\x80\x99 Lightwood was beginning to remonstrate, when he caught at\r\nthe words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! See now! That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I am incapable of doing. How very\r\nacute you are, Mortimer, in finding my weak place! When we were at\r\nschool together, I got up my lessons at the last moment, day by day and\r\nbit by bit; now we are out in life together, I get up my lessons in the\r\nsame way. In the present task I have not got beyond this:--I am bent\r\non finding Lizzie, and I mean to find her, and I will take any means\r\nof finding her that offer themselves. Fair means or foul means, are all\r\nalike to me. I ask you--for information--what does that mean? When I\r\nhave found her I may ask you--also for information--what do I mean now?\r\nBut it would be premature in this stage, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not the character of\r\nmy mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood was shaking his head over the air with which his friend held\r\nforth thus--an air so whimsically open and argumentative as almost to\r\ndeprive what he said of the appearance of evasion--when a shuffling was\r\nheard at the outer door, and then an undecided knock, as though\r\nsome hand were groping for the knocker. \xe2\x80\x98The frolicsome youth of the\r\nneighbourhood,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98whom I should be delighted to pitch from\r\nthis elevation into the churchyard below, without any intermediate\r\nceremonies, have probably turned the lamp out. I am on duty to-night,\r\nand will see to the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend had barely had time to recall the unprecedented gleam of\r\ndetermination with which he had spoken of finding this girl, and which\r\nhad faded out of him with the breath of the spoken words, when Eugene\r\ncame back, ushering in a most disgraceful shadow of a man, shaking from\r\nhead to foot, and clothed in shabby grease and smear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This interesting gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98is the son--the\r\noccasionally rather trying son, for he has his failings--of a lady of my\r\nacquaintance. My dear Mortimer--Mr Dolls.\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene had no idea what his\r\nname was, knowing the little dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s to be assumed, but presented\r\nhim with easy confidence under the first appellation that his\r\nassociations suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I gather, my dear Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Eugene, as Lightwood stared at\r\nthe obscene visitor, \xe2\x80\x98from the manner of Mr Dolls--which is occasionally\r\ncomplicated--that he desires to make some communication to me. I have\r\nmentioned to Mr Dolls that you and I are on terms of confidence, and\r\nhave requested Mr Dolls to develop his views here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wretched object being much embarrassed by holding what remained\r\nof his hat, Eugene airily tossed it to the door, and put him down in a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be necessary, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed, \xe2\x80\x98to wind up Mr Dolls,\r\nbefore anything to any mortal purpose can be got out of him. Brandy, Mr\r\nDolls, or--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orth Rum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Dolls.\r\n\r\nA judiciously small quantity of the spirit was given him in a\r\nwine-glass, and he began to convey it to his mouth, with all kinds of\r\nfalterings and gyrations on the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The nerves of Mr Dolls,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene to Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98are\r\nconsiderably unstrung. And I deem it on the whole expedient to fumigate\r\nMr Dolls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took the shovel from the grate, sprinkled a few live ashes on it, and\r\nfrom a box on the chimney-piece took a few pastiles, which he set upon\r\nthem; then, with great composure began placidly waving the shovel in\r\nfront of Mr Dolls, to cut him off from his company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord bless my soul, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Lightwood, laughing again, \xe2\x80\x98what a\r\nmad fellow you are! Why does this creature come to see you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall hear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wrayburn, very observant of his face withal. \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\nthen. Speak out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. State your business, Dolls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mist Wrayburn!\xe2\x80\x99 said the visitor, thickly and huskily. \xe2\x80\x98--\xe2\x80\x98TIS Mist\r\nWrayburn, ain\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x99 With a stupid stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course it is. Look at me. What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Dolls collapsed in his chair, and faintly said \xe2\x80\x98Threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orth Rum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you do me the favour, my dear Mortimer, to wind up Mr Dolls\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98I am occupied with the fumigation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA similar quantity was poured into his glass, and he got it to his lips\r\nby similar circuitous ways. Having drunk it, Mr Dolls, with an evident\r\nfear of running down again unless he made haste, proceeded to business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mist Wrayburn. Tried to nudge you, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. You want that\r\ndrection. You want t\xe2\x80\x99know where she lives. DO you Mist Wrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a glance at his friend, Eugene replied to the question sternly, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am er man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Dolls, trying to smite himself on the breast, but\r\nbringing his hand to bear upon the vicinity of his eye, \xe2\x80\x98er do it. I am\r\ner man er do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you the man to do?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Eugene, still sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Er give up that drection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you got it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a most laborious attempt at pride and dignity, Mr Dolls rolled\r\nhis head for some time, awakening the highest expectations, and then\r\nanswered, as if it were the happiest point that could possibly be\r\nexpected of him: \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Dolls, collapsing in the drowsiest manner after his late intellectual\r\ntriumph, replied: \xe2\x80\x98Threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orth Rum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wind him up again, my dear Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wrayburn; \xe2\x80\x98wind him up\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, Eugene,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Lightwood in a low voice, as he complied, \xe2\x80\x98can\r\nyou stoop to the use of such an instrument as this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply, made with that former gleam of determination,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I would find her out by any means, fair or foul. These are foul,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll take them--if I am not first tempted to break the head of Mr\r\nDolls with the fumigator. Can you get the direction? Do you mean that?\r\nSpeak! If that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have come for, say how much you want.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ten shillings--Threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orths Rum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Dolls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fifteen shillings--Threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orths Rum,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Dolls, making an\r\nattempt to stiffen himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall have it. Stop at that. How will you get the direction you\r\ntalk of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am er man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Dolls, with majesty, \xe2\x80\x98er get it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How will you get it, I ask you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am ill-used vidual,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Dolls. \xe2\x80\x98Blown up morning t\xe2\x80\x99night. Called\r\nnames. She makes Mint money, sir, and never stands Threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orth Rum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get on,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Eugene, tapping his palsied head with the\r\nfire-shovel, as it sank on his breast. \xe2\x80\x98What comes next?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMaking a dignified attempt to gather himself together, but, as it were,\r\ndropping half a dozen pieces of himself while he tried in vain to pick\r\nup one, Mr Dolls, swaying his head from side to side, regarded his\r\nquestioner with what he supposed to be a haughty smile and a scornful\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She looks upon me as mere child, sir. I am NOT mere child, sir. Man.\r\nMan talent. Lerrers pass betwixt \xe2\x80\x98em. Postman lerrers. Easy for man\r\ntalent er get drection, as get his own drection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get it then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; adding very heartily under his breath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--You Brute! Get it, and bring it here to me, and earn the money for\r\nsixty threepenn\xe2\x80\x99orths of rum, and drink them all, one a top of another,\r\nand drink yourself dead with all possible expedition.\xe2\x80\x99 The latter\r\nclauses of these special instructions he addressed to the fire, as he\r\ngave it back the ashes he had taken from it, and replaced the shovel.\r\n\r\nMr Dolls now struck out the highly unexpected discovery that he had been\r\ninsulted by Lightwood, and stated his desire to \xe2\x80\x98have it out with him\xe2\x80\x99\r\non the spot, and defied him to come on, upon the liberal terms of\r\na sovereign to a halfpenny. Mr Dolls then fell a crying, and then\r\nexhibited a tendency to fall asleep. This last manifestation as by far\r\nthe most alarming, by reason of its threatening his prolonged stay\r\non the premises, necessitated vigorous measures. Eugene picked up his\r\nworn-out hat with the tongs, clapped it on his head, and, taking him by\r\nthe collar--all this at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length--conducted him down stairs and out\r\nof the precincts into Fleet Street. There, he turned his face westward,\r\nand left him.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back, Lightwood was standing over the fire, brooding in a\r\nsufficiently low-spirited manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll wash my hands of Mr Dolls physically--\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98and be with\r\nyou again directly, Mortimer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would much prefer,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98your washing your hands of Mr\r\nDolls, morally, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So would I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98but you see, dear boy, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do without\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two he resumed his chair, as perfectly unconcerned as\r\nusual, and rallied his friend on having so narrowly escaped the prowess\r\nof their muscular visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t be amused on this theme,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, restlessly. \xe2\x80\x98You can\r\nmake almost any theme amusing to me, Eugene, but not this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I am a little ashamed of it myself, and therefore\r\nlet us change the subject.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so deplorably underhanded,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer. \xe2\x80\x98It is so unworthy of\r\nyou, this setting on of such a shameful scout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have changed the subject!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Eugene, airily. \xe2\x80\x98We have found\r\na new one in that word, scout. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be like Patience on a mantelpiece\r\nfrowning at Dolls, but sit down, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something that you\r\nreally will find amusing. Take a cigar. Look at this of mine. I\r\nlight it--draw one puff--breathe the smoke out--there it goes--it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nDolls!--it\xe2\x80\x99s gone--and being gone you are a man again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your subject,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, after lighting a cigar, and comforting\r\nhimself with a whiff or two, \xe2\x80\x98was scouts, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it droll that I never go out after dark, but I find\r\nmyself attended, always by one scout, and often by two?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood took his cigar from his lips in surprise, and looked at his\r\nfriend, as if with a latent suspicion that there must be a jest or\r\nhidden meaning in his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On my honour, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wrayburn, answering the look and smiling\r\ncarelessly; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at your supposing so, but on my honour, no.\r\nI say what I mean. I never go out after dark, but I find myself in the\r\nludicrous situation of being followed and observed at a distance, always\r\nby one scout, and often by two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure, Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sure? My dear boy, they are always the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there\xe2\x80\x99s no process out against you. The Jews only threaten. They\r\nhave done nothing. Besides, they know where to find you, and I represent\r\nyou. Why take the trouble?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Observe the legal mind!\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene, turning round to the\r\nfurniture again, with an air of indolent rapture. \xe2\x80\x98Observe the dyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, assimilating itself to what it works in,--or would work in, if\r\nanybody would give it anything to do. Respected solicitor, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nthat. The schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s abroad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The schoolmaster?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! Sometimes the schoolmaster and the pupil are both abroad. Why, how\r\nsoon you rust in my absence! You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand yet? Those fellows\r\nwho were here one night. They are the scouts I speak of, as doing me the\r\nhonour to attend me after dark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long has this been going on?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lightwood, opposing a serious\r\nface to the laugh of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I apprehend it has been going on, ever since a certain person went off.\r\nProbably, it had been going on some little time before I noticed it:\r\nwhich would bring it to about that time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think they suppose you to have inveigled her away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mortimer, you know the absorbing nature of my professional\r\noccupations; I really have not had leisure to think about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you asked them what they want? Have you objected?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why should I ask them what they want, dear fellow, when I am\r\nindifferent what they want? Why should I express objection, when I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nobject?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are in your most reckless mood. But you called the situation just\r\nnow, a ludicrous one; and most men object to that, even those who are\r\nutterly indifferent to everything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You charm me, Mortimer, with your reading of my weaknesses. (By-the-by,\r\nthat very word, Reading, in its critical use, always charms me. An\r\nactress\xe2\x80\x99s Reading of a chambermaid, a dancer\xe2\x80\x99s Reading of a hornpipe, a\r\nsinger\xe2\x80\x99s Reading of a song, a marine painter\xe2\x80\x99s Reading of the sea,\r\nthe kettle-drum\xe2\x80\x99s Reading of an instrumental passage, are phrases\r\never youthful and delightful.) I was mentioning your perception of my\r\nweaknesses. I own to the weakness of objecting to occupy a ludicrous\r\nposition, and therefore I transfer the position to the scouts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish, Eugene, you would speak a little more soberly and plainly, if\r\nit were only out of consideration for my feeling less at ease than you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then soberly and plainly, Mortimer, I goad the schoolmaster to madness.\r\nI make the schoolmaster so ridiculous, and so aware of being made\r\nridiculous, that I see him chafe and fret at every pore when we cross\r\none another. The amiable occupation has been the solace of my life,\r\nsince I was baulked in the manner unnecessary to recall. I have derived\r\ninexpressible comfort from it. I do it thus: I stroll out after dark,\r\nstroll a little way, look in at a window and furtively look out for the\r\nschoolmaster. Sooner or later, I perceive the schoolmaster on the watch;\r\nsometimes accompanied by his hopeful pupil; oftener, pupil-less. Having\r\nmade sure of his watching me, I tempt him on, all over London. One\r\nnight I go east, another night north, in a few nights I go all round the\r\ncompass. Sometimes, I walk; sometimes, I proceed in cabs, draining the\r\npocket of the schoolmaster who then follows in cabs. I study and get\r\nup abstruse No Thoroughfares in the course of the day. With Venetian\r\nmystery I seek those No Thoroughfares at night, glide into them by means\r\nof dark courts, tempt the schoolmaster to follow, turn suddenly, and\r\ncatch him before he can retreat. Then we face one another, and I pass\r\nhim as unaware of his existence, and he undergoes grinding torments.\r\nSimilarly, I walk at a great pace down a short street, rapidly turn the\r\ncorner, and, getting out of his view, as rapidly turn back. I catch him\r\ncoming on post, again pass him as unaware of his existence, and again\r\nhe undergoes grinding torments. Night after night his disappointment is\r\nacute, but hope springs eternal in the scholastic breast, and he follows\r\nme again to-morrow. Thus I enjoy the pleasures of the chase, and derive\r\ngreat benefit from the healthful exercise. When I do not enjoy the\r\npleasures of the chase, for anything I know he watches at the Temple\r\nGate all night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is an extraordinary story,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Lightwood, who had heard it\r\nout with serious attention. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a little hipped, dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98you have been too\r\nsedentary. Come and enjoy the pleasures of the chase.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that you believe he is watching now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not the slightest doubt he is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you seen him to-night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forgot to look for him when I was last out,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene with the\r\ncalmest indifference; \xe2\x80\x98but I dare say he was there. Come! Be a British\r\nsportsman and enjoy the pleasures of the chase. It will do you good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood hesitated; but, yielding to his curiosity, rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Eugene, rising too. \xe2\x80\x98Or, if Yoicks would be in better\r\nkeeping, consider that I said Yoicks. Look to your feet, Mortimer, for\r\nwe shall try your boots. When you are ready, I am--need I say with a Hey\r\nHo Chivey, and likewise with a Hark Forward, Hark Forward, Tantivy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will nothing make you serious?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, laughing through his\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am always serious, but just now I am a little excited by the glorious\r\nfact that a southerly wind and a cloudy sky proclaim a hunting evening.\r\nReady? So. We turn out the lamp and shut the door, and take the field.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the two friends passed out of the Temple into the public street,\r\nEugene demanded with a show of courteous patronage in which direction\r\nMortimer would you like the run to be? \xe2\x80\x98There is a rather difficult\r\ncountry about Bethnal Green,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98and we have not taken in\r\nthat direction lately. What is your opinion of Bethnal Green?\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer\r\nassented to Bethnal Green, and they turned eastward. \xe2\x80\x98Now, when we come\r\nto St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s churchyard,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll loiter artfully, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the schoolmaster.\xe2\x80\x99 But, they both saw him, before they got\r\nthere; alone, and stealing after them in the shadow of the houses, on\r\nthe opposite side of the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get your wind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98for I am off directly. Does it occur\r\nto you that the boys of Merry England will begin to deteriorate in an\r\neducational light, if this lasts long? The schoolmaster can\xe2\x80\x99t attend to\r\nme and the boys too. Got your wind? I am off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt what a rate he went, to breathe the schoolmaster; and how he then\r\nlounged and loitered, to put his patience to another kind of wear;\r\nwhat preposterous ways he took, with no other object on earth than to\r\ndisappoint and punish him; and how he wore him out by every piece of\r\ningenuity that his eccentric humour could devise; all this Lightwood\r\nnoted, with a feeling of astonishment that so careless a man could be so\r\nwary, and that so idle a man could take so much trouble. At last, far on\r\nin the third hour of the pleasures of the chase, when he had brought the\r\npoor dogging wretch round again into the City, he twisted Mortimer up\r\na few dark entries, twisted him into a little square court, twisted him\r\nsharp round again, and they almost ran against Bradley Headstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you see, as I was saying, Mortimer,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Eugene aloud with\r\nthe utmost coolness, as though there were no one within hearing\r\nby themselves: \xe2\x80\x98and you see, as I was saying--undergoing grinding\r\ntorments.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not too strong a phrase for the occasion. Looking like the hunted\r\nand not the hunter, baffled, worn, with the exhaustion of deferred\r\nhope and consuming hate and anger in his face, white-lipped, wild-eyed,\r\ndraggle-haired, seamed with jealousy and anger, and torturing himself\r\nwith the conviction that he showed it all and they exulted in it, he\r\nwent by them in the dark, like a haggard head suspended in the air: so\r\ncompletely did the force of his expression cancel his figure.\r\n\r\nMortimer Lightwood was not an extraordinarily impressible man, but this\r\nface impressed him. He spoke of it more than once on the remainder of\r\nthe way home, and more than once when they got home.\r\n\r\nThey had been abed in their respective rooms two or three hours, when\r\nEugene was partly awakened by hearing a footstep going about, and was\r\nfully awakened by seeing Lightwood standing at his bedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing wrong, Mortimer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What fancy takes you, then, for walking about in the night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am horribly wakeful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How comes that about, I wonder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, I cannot lose sight of that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Odd!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene with a light laugh, \xe2\x80\x98I can.\xe2\x80\x99 And turned over, and\r\nfell asleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nIN THE DARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no sleep for Bradley Headstone on that night when Eugene\r\nWrayburn turned so easily in his bed; there was no sleep for little\r\nMiss Peecher. Bradley consumed the lonely hours, and consumed himself in\r\nhaunting the spot where his careless rival lay a dreaming; little Miss\r\nPeecher wore them away in listening for the return home of the master\r\nof her heart, and in sorrowfully presaging that much was amiss with him.\r\nYet more was amiss with him than Miss Peecher\xe2\x80\x99s simply arranged little\r\nwork-box of thoughts, fitted with no gloomy and dark recesses, could\r\nhold. For, the state of the man was murderous.\r\n\r\nThe state of the man was murderous, and he knew it. More; he irritated\r\nit, with a kind of perverse pleasure akin to that which a sick man\r\nsometimes has in irritating a wound upon his body. Tied up all day with\r\nhis disciplined show upon him, subdued to the performance of his routine\r\nof educational tricks, encircled by a gabbling crowd, he broke loose at\r\nnight like an ill-tamed wild animal. Under his daily restraint, it was\r\nhis compensation, not his trouble, to give a glance towards his state at\r\nnight, and to the freedom of its being indulged. If great criminals told\r\nthe truth--which, being great criminals, they do not--they would very\r\nrarely tell of their struggles against the crime. Their struggles are\r\ntowards it. They buffet with opposing waves, to gain the bloody shore,\r\nnot to recede from it. This man perfectly comprehended that he hated his\r\nrival with his strongest and worst forces, and that if he tracked him to\r\nLizzie Hexam, his so doing would never serve himself with her, or serve\r\nher. All his pains were taken, to the end that he might incense himself\r\nwith the sight of the detested figure in her company and favour, in her\r\nplace of concealment. And he knew as well what act of his would follow\r\nif he did, as he knew that his mother had borne him. Granted, that he\r\nmay not have held it necessary to make express mention to himself of the\r\none familiar truth any more than of the other.\r\n\r\nHe knew equally well that he fed his wrath and hatred, and that he\r\naccumulated provocation and self-justification, by being made the\r\nnightly sport of the reckless and insolent Eugene. Knowing all\r\nthis,--and still always going on with infinite endurance, pains, and\r\nperseverance, could his dark soul doubt whither he went?\r\n\r\nBaffled, exasperated, and weary, he lingered opposite the Temple gate\r\nwhen it closed on Wrayburn and Lightwood, debating with himself should\r\nhe go home for that time or should he watch longer. Possessed in his\r\njealousy by the fixed idea that Wrayburn was in the secret, if it were\r\nnot altogether of his contriving, Bradley was as confident of getting\r\nthe better of him at last by sullenly sticking to him, as he would have\r\nbeen--and often had been--of mastering any piece of study in the way\r\nof his vocation, by the like slow persistent process. A man of rapid\r\npassions and sluggish intelligence, it had served him often and should\r\nserve him again.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion crossed him as he rested in a doorway with his eyes upon\r\nthe Temple gate, that perhaps she was even concealed in that set of\r\nChambers. It would furnish another reason for Wrayburn\xe2\x80\x99s purposeless\r\nwalks, and it might be. He thought of it and thought of it, until\r\nhe resolved to steal up the stairs, if the gatekeeper would let him\r\nthrough, and listen. So, the haggard head suspended in the air flitted\r\nacross the road, like the spectre of one of the many heads erst hoisted\r\nupon neighbouring Temple Bar, and stopped before the watchman.\r\n\r\nThe watchman looked at it, and asked: \xe2\x80\x98Who for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He came back with Mr Lightwood, I know, near upon two hours ago. But if\r\nhe has gone to bed, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a paper in his letter-box. I am expected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe watchman said no more, but opened the gate, though rather\r\ndoubtfully. Seeing, however, that the visitor went straight and fast in\r\nthe right direction, he seemed satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe haggard head floated up the dark staircase, and softly descended\r\nnearer to the floor outside the outer door of the chambers. The doors\r\nof the rooms within, appeared to be standing open. There were rays of\r\ncandlelight from one of them, and there was the sound of a footstep\r\ngoing about. There were two voices. The words they uttered were not\r\ndistinguishable, but they were both the voices of men. In a few moments\r\nthe voices were silent, and there was no sound of footstep, and the\r\ninner light went out. If Lightwood could have seen the face which kept\r\nhim awake, staring and listening in the darkness outside the door as\r\nhe spoke of it, he might have been less disposed to sleep, through the\r\nremainder of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley; \xe2\x80\x98but she might have been.\xe2\x80\x99 The head arose to\r\nits former height from the ground, floated down the stair-case again,\r\nand passed on to the gate. A man was standing there, in parley with the\r\nwatchman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said the watchman. \xe2\x80\x98Here he is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerceiving himself to be the antecedent, Bradley looked from the\r\nwatchman to the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This man is leaving a letter for Mr Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 the watchman explained,\r\nshowing it in his hand; \xe2\x80\x98and I was mentioning that a person had just\r\ngone up to Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s chambers. It might be the same business\r\nperhaps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, glancing at the man, who was a stranger to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 the man assented in a surly way; \xe2\x80\x98my letter--it\xe2\x80\x99s wrote by my\r\ndaughter, but it\xe2\x80\x99s mine--is about my business, and my business ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnobody else\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Bradley passed out at the gate with an undecided foot, he heard it\r\nshut behind him, and heard the footstep of the man coming after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Scuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, who appeared to have been drinking and rather\r\nstumbled at him than touched him, to attract his attention: \xe2\x80\x98but might\r\nyou be acquainted with the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With whom?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man, pointing backward over his right shoulder with\r\nhis right thumb, \xe2\x80\x98the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why look here,\xe2\x80\x99 hooking his proposition on his left-hand fingers with\r\nthe forefinger of his right. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s two Governors, ain\xe2\x80\x99t there? One\r\nand one, two--Lawyer Lightwood, my first finger, he\xe2\x80\x99s one, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\nWell; might you be acquainted with my middle finger, the T\xe2\x80\x99other?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know quite as much of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, with a frown and a distant\r\nlook before him, \xe2\x80\x98as I want to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hooroar!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the man. \xe2\x80\x98Hooroar T\xe2\x80\x99other t\xe2\x80\x99other Governor. Hooroar\r\nT\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor! I am of your way of thinkin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t make such a noise at this dead hour of the night. What are you\r\ntalking about?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man, becoming hoarsely\r\nconfidential. \xe2\x80\x98The T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor he\xe2\x80\x99s always joked his jokes agin me,\r\nowing, as I believe, to my being a honest man as gets my living by the\r\nsweat of my brow. Which he ain\xe2\x80\x99t, and he don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is that to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the man in a tone of injured innocence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care to hear no more, don\xe2\x80\x99t hear no more. You begun it.\r\nYou said, and likeways showed pretty plain, as you warn\xe2\x80\x99t by no means\r\nfriendly to him. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t seek to force my company nor yet my\r\nopinions on no man. I am a honest man, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I am. Put me in the\r\ndock anywhere--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care where--and I says, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, I am a honest\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d Put me in the witness-box anywhere--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care where--and I\r\nsays the same to his lordship, and I kisses the book. I don\xe2\x80\x99t kiss my\r\ncoat-cuff; I kisses the book.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not so much in deference to these strong testimonials to\r\ncharacter, as in his restless casting about for any way or help towards\r\nthe discovery on which he was concentrated, that Bradley Headstone\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t take offence. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to stop you. You were\r\ntoo--loud in the open street; that was all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Totherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Riderhood, mollified and mysterious,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know wot it is to be loud, and I know wot it is to be soft. Nat\xe2\x80\x99rally\r\nI do. It would be a wonder if I did not, being by the Chris\xe2\x80\x99en name of\r\nRoger, which took it arter my own father, which took it from his own\r\nfather, though which of our fam\xe2\x80\x99ly fust took it nat\xe2\x80\x99ral I will not in\r\nany ways mislead you by undertakin\xe2\x80\x99 to say. And wishing that your elth\r\nmay be better than your looks, which your inside must be bad indeed if\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s on the footing of your out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStartled by the implication that his face revealed too much of his mind,\r\nBradley made an effort to clear his brow. It might be worth knowing what\r\nthis strange man\xe2\x80\x99s business was with Lightwood, or Wrayburn, or both, at\r\nsuch an unseasonable hour. He set himself to find out, for the man might\r\nprove to be a messenger between those two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You call at the Temple late,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked, with a lumbering show of\r\nease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wish I may die,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Riderhood, with a hoarse laugh, \xe2\x80\x98if I warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say the self-same words to you, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It chanced so with me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, looking disconcertedly about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it chanced so with me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling\r\nyou how. Why should I mind telling you? I\xe2\x80\x99m a Deputy Lock-keeper up the\r\nriver, and I was off duty yes\xe2\x80\x99day, and I shall be on to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and I come to London to look arter my private affairs. My private\r\naffairs is to get appinted to the Lock as reg\xe2\x80\x99lar keeper at fust hand,\r\nand to have the law of a busted B\xe2\x80\x99low-Bridge steamer which drownded of\r\nme. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a goin\xe2\x80\x99 to be drownded and not paid for it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley looked at him, as though he were claiming to be a Ghost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The steamer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood, obstinately, \xe2\x80\x98run me down and drownded\r\nof me. Interference on the part of other parties brought me round; but\r\nI never asked \xe2\x80\x98em to bring me round, nor yet the steamer never asked \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nto it. I mean to be paid for the life as the steamer took.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was that your business at Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s chambers in the middle of the\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley, eyeing him with distrust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That and to get a writing to be fust-hand Lock Keeper. A recommendation\r\nin writing being looked for, who else ought to give it to me? As I says\r\nin the letter in my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, with my mark put to it to make it\r\ngood in law, Who but you, Lawyer Lightwood, ought to hand over this here\r\nstifficate, and who but you ought to go in for damages on my account\r\nagin the Steamer? For (as I says under my mark) I have had trouble\r\nenough along of you and your friend. If you, Lawyer Lightwood, had\r\nbacked me good and true, and if the T\xe2\x80\x99other Governor had took me down\r\ncorrect (I says under my mark), I should have been worth money at the\r\npresent time, instead of having a barge-load of bad names chucked at me,\r\nand being forced to eat my words, which is a unsatisfying sort of food\r\nwotever a man\xe2\x80\x99s appetite! And when you mention the middle of the night,\r\nT\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 growled Mr Riderhood, winding up his monotonous\r\nsummary of his wrongs, \xe2\x80\x98throw your eye on this here bundle under my arm,\r\nand bear in mind that I\xe2\x80\x99m a walking back to my Lock, and that the Temple\r\nlaid upon my line of road.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone\xe2\x80\x99s face had changed during this latter recital, and he\r\nhad observed the speaker with a more sustained attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, after a pause, during which they walked on side\r\nby side, \xe2\x80\x98that I believe I could tell you your name, if I tried?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prove your opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer, accompanied with a stop and a\r\nstare. \xe2\x80\x98Try.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your name is Riderhood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m blest if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyour\xe2\x80\x99n.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s quite another thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley. \xe2\x80\x98I never supposed you did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Bradley walked on meditating, the Rogue walked on at his side\r\nmuttering. The purport of the muttering was: \xe2\x80\x98that Rogue Riderhood, by\r\nGeorge! seemed to be made public property on, now, and that every man\r\nseemed to think himself free to handle his name as if it was a Street\r\nPump.\xe2\x80\x99 The purport of the meditating was: \xe2\x80\x98Here is an instrument. Can I\r\nuse it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey had walked along the Strand, and into Pall Mall, and had turned\r\nup-hill towards Hyde Park Corner; Bradley Headstone waiting on the pace\r\nand lead of Riderhood, and leaving him to indicate the course. So slow\r\nwere the schoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, and so indistinct his purposes when\r\nthey were but tributary to the one absorbing purpose or rather when,\r\nlike dark trees under a stormy sky, they only lined the long vista at\r\nthe end of which he saw those two figures of Wrayburn and Lizzie on\r\nwhich his eyes were fixed--that at least a good half-mile was traversed\r\nbefore he spoke again. Even then, it was only to ask:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is your Lock?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Twenty mile and odd--call it five-and-twenty mile and odd, if you\r\nlike--up stream,\xe2\x80\x99 was the sullen reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How is it called?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plashwater Weir Mill Lock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose I was to offer you five shillings; what then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, then, I\xe2\x80\x99d take it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster put his hand in his pocket, and produced two\r\nhalf-crowns, and placed them in Mr Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s palm: who stopped at\r\na convenient doorstep to ring them both, before acknowledging their\r\nreceipt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing about you, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood,\r\nfaring on again, \xe2\x80\x98as looks well and goes fur. You\xe2\x80\x99re a ready money man.\r\nNow;\xe2\x80\x99 when he had carefully pocketed the coins on that side of himself\r\nwhich was furthest from his new friend; \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s this for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, o\xe2\x80\x99 course I know THAT,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, as arguing something that\r\nwas self-evident. \xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99 course I know very well as no man in his right\r\nsenses would suppose as anythink would make me give it up agin when I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nonce got it. But what do you want for it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I want anything for it. Or if I do want anything\r\nfor it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.\xe2\x80\x99 Bradley gave this answer in a stolid,\r\nvacant, and self-communing manner, which Mr Riderhood found very\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have no goodwill towards this Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, coming to\r\nthe name in a reluctant and forced way, as if he were dragged to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither have I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood nodded, and asked: \xe2\x80\x98Is it for that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s as much for that as anything else. It\xe2\x80\x99s something to be agreed\r\nwith, on a subject that occupies so much of one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with YOU,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Riderhood, bluntly. \xe2\x80\x98No! It\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no use a lookin\xe2\x80\x99 as if you wanted\r\nto make out that it did. I tell you it rankles in you. It rankles in\r\nyou, rusts in you, and pisons you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say that it does so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bradley with quivering lips; \xe2\x80\x98is there\r\nno cause for it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cause enough, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet a pound!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you yourself declared that the fellow has heaped provocations,\r\ninsults, and affronts on you, or something to that effect? He has done\r\nthe same by me. He is made of venomous insults and affronts, from the\r\ncrown of his head to the sole of his foot. Are you so hopeful or so\r\nstupid, as not to know that he and the other will treat your application\r\nwith contempt, and light their cigars with it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if they did, by George!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, turning\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If they did! They will. Let me ask you a question. I know something\r\nmore than your name about you; I knew something about Gaffer Hexam. When\r\ndid you last set eyes upon his daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When did I last set eyes upon his daughter, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrepeated Mr Riderhood, growing intentionally slower of comprehension as\r\nthe other quickened in his speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Not to speak to her. To see her--anywhere?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Rogue had got the clue he wanted, though he held it with a clumsy\r\nhand. Looking perplexedly at the passionate face, as if he were trying\r\nto work out a sum in his mind, he slowly answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t set eyes upon her--never once--not since the day of Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know her well, by sight?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think I did! No one better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you know him as well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s him?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riderhood, taking off his hat and rubbing his\r\nforehead, as he directed a dull look at his questioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Curse the name! Is it so agreeable to you that you want to hear it\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! HIM!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, who had craftily worked the schoolmaster into\r\nthis corner, that he might again take note of his face under its evil\r\npossession. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d know HIM among a thousand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you--\xe2\x80\x99 Bradley tried to ask it quietly; but, do what he might\r\nwith his voice, he could not subdue his face;--\xe2\x80\x98did you ever see them\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n(The Rogue had got the clue in both hands now.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see \xe2\x80\x98em together, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor, on the very day when Gaffer\r\nwas towed ashore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley could have hidden a reserved piece of information from the sharp\r\neyes of a whole inquisitive class, but he could not veil from the eyes\r\nof the ignorant Riderhood the withheld question next in his breast.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall put it plain if you want it answered,\xe2\x80\x99 thought the Rogue,\r\ndoggedly; \xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going a wolunteering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! was he insolent to her too?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley after a struggle. \xe2\x80\x98Or\r\ndid he make a show of being kind to her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He made a show of being most uncommon kind to her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98By\r\nGeorge! now I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis flying off at a tangent was indisputably natural. Bradley looked at\r\nhim for the reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I think of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Riderhood, evasively, for he was\r\nsubstituting those words for \xe2\x80\x98Now I see you so jealous,\xe2\x80\x99 which was the\r\nphrase really in his mind; \xe2\x80\x98P\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps he went and took me down wrong, a\r\npurpose, on account o\xe2\x80\x99 being sweet upon her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe baseness of confirming him in this suspicion or pretence of one (for\r\nhe could not have really entertained it), was a line\xe2\x80\x99s breadth beyond\r\nthe mark the schoolmaster had reached. The baseness of communing and\r\nintriguing with the fellow who would have set that stain upon her, and\r\nupon her brother too, was attained. The line\xe2\x80\x99s breadth further, lay\r\nbeyond. He made no reply, but walked on with a lowering face.\r\n\r\nWhat he might gain by this acquaintance, he could not work out in his\r\nslow and cumbrous thoughts. The man had an injury against the object of\r\nhis hatred, and that was something; though it was less than he supposed,\r\nfor there dwelt in the man no such deadly rage and resentment as burned\r\nin his own breast. The man knew her, and might by a fortunate chance see\r\nher, or hear of her; that was something, as enlisting one pair of eyes\r\nand ears the more. The man was a bad man, and willing enough to be in\r\nhis pay. That was something, for his own state and purpose were as\r\nbad as bad could be, and he seemed to derive a vague support from the\r\npossession of a congenial instrument, though it might never be used.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stood still, and asked Riderhood point-blank if he knew\r\nwhere she was? Clearly, he did not know. He asked Riderhood if he would\r\nbe willing, in case any intelligence of her, or of Wrayburn as seeking\r\nher or associating with her, should fall in his way, to communicate it\r\nif it were paid for? He would be very willing indeed. He was \xe2\x80\x98agin \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nboth,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with an oath, and for why? \xe2\x80\x98Cause they had both stood\r\nbetwixt him and his getting his living by the sweat of his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will not be long then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone, after some more\r\ndiscourse to this effect, \xe2\x80\x98before we see one another again. Here is the\r\ncountry road, and here is the day. Both have come upon me by surprise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to\r\nfind you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is of no consequence. I know where to find you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to\r\nyour Lock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Riderhood again, \xe2\x80\x98no luck never\r\ncome yet of a dry acquaintance. Let\xe2\x80\x99s wet it, in a mouth-fill of rum and\r\nmilk, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest Governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley assenting, went with him into an early public-house, haunted by\r\nunsavoury smells of musty hay and stale straw, where returning carts,\r\nfarmers\xe2\x80\x99 men, gaunt dogs, fowls of a beery breed, and certain human\r\nnightbirds fluttering home to roost, were solacing themselves after\r\ntheir several manners; and where not one of the nightbirds hovering\r\nabout the sloppy bar failed to discern at a glance in the passion-wasted\r\nnightbird with respectable feathers, the worst nightbird of all.\r\n\r\nAn inspiration of affection for a half-drunken carter going his way led\r\nto Mr Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s being elevated on a high heap of baskets on a waggon,\r\nand pursuing his journey recumbent on his back with his head on his\r\nbundle. Bradley then turned to retrace his steps, and by-and-by struck\r\noff through little-traversed ways, and by-and-by reached school and\r\nhome. Up came the sun to find him washed and brushed, methodically\r\ndressed in decent black coat and waistcoat, decent formal black tie, and\r\npepper-and-salt pantaloons, with his decent silver watch in its pocket,\r\nand its decent hair-guard round his neck: a scholastic huntsman clad for\r\nthe field, with his fresh pack yelping and barking around him.\r\n\r\nYet more really bewitched than the miserable creatures of the\r\nmuch-lamented times, who accused themselves of impossibilities under a\r\ncontagion of horror and the strongly suggestive influences of Torture,\r\nhe had been ridden hard by Evil Spirits in the night that was newly\r\ngone. He had been spurred and whipped and heavily sweated. If a record\r\nof the sport had usurped the places of the peaceful texts from Scripture\r\non the wall, the most advanced of the scholars might have taken fright\r\nand run away from the master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nMEANING MISCHIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nUp came the sun, streaming all over London, and in its glorious\r\nimpartiality even condescending to make prismatic sparkles in the\r\nwhiskers of Mr Alfred Lammle as he sat at breakfast. In need of some\r\nbrightening from without, was Mr Alfred Lammle, for he had the air of\r\nbeing dull enough within, and looked grievously discontented.\r\n\r\nMrs Alfred Lammle faced her lord. The happy pair of swindlers, with\r\nthe comfortable tie between them that each had swindled the other, sat\r\nmoodily observant of the tablecloth. Things looked so gloomy in the\r\nbreakfast-room, albeit on the sunny side of Sackville Street, that any\r\nof the family tradespeople glancing through the blinds might have taken\r\nthe hint to send in his account and press for it. But this, indeed, most\r\nof the family tradespeople had already done, without the hint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98that you have had no money at all,\r\never since we have been married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What seems to you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98to have been the case, may\r\npossibly have been the case. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWas it the speciality of Mr and Mrs Lammle, or does it ever obtain\r\nwith other loving couples? In these matrimonial dialogues they never\r\naddressed each other, but always some invisible presence that appeared\r\nto take a station about midway between them. Perhaps the skeleton in the\r\ncupboard comes out to be talked to, on such domestic occasions?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never seen any money in the house,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle to the\r\nskeleton, \xe2\x80\x98except my own annuity. That I swear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t take the trouble of swearing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle to the\r\nskeleton; \xe2\x80\x98once more, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You never turned your annuity\r\nto so good an account.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good an account! In what way?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the way of getting credit, and living well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle. Perhaps\r\nthe skeleton laughed scornfully on being intrusted with this question\r\nand this answer; certainly Mrs Lammle did, and Mr Lammle did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what is to happen next?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Lammle of the skeleton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Smash is to happen next,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle to the same authority.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Mrs Lammle looked disdainfully at the skeleton--but without\r\ncarrying the look on to Mr Lammle--and drooped her eyes. After that, Mr\r\nLammle did exactly the same thing, and drooped HIS eyes. A servant then\r\nentering with toast, the skeleton retired into the closet, and shut\r\nitself up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, when the servant had withdrawn. And then,\r\nvery much louder: \xe2\x80\x98Sophronia!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Attend to me, if you please.\xe2\x80\x99 He eyed her sternly until she did attend,\r\nand then went on. \xe2\x80\x98I want to take counsel with you. Come, come; no more\r\ntrifling. You know our league and covenant. We are to work together for\r\nour joint interest, and you are as knowing a hand as I am. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe together, if you were not. What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? We are hemmed into a\r\ncorner. What shall we do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you no scheme on foot that will bring in anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle plunged into his whiskers for reflection, and came out\r\nhopeless: \xe2\x80\x98No; as adventurers we are obliged to play rash games for\r\nchances of high winnings, and there has been a run of luck against us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was resuming, \xe2\x80\x98Have you nothing--\xe2\x80\x99 when he stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We, Sophronia. We, we, we.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have we nothing to sell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Deuce a bit. I have given a Jew a bill of sale on this furniture, and\r\nhe could take it to-morrow, to-day, now. He would have taken it before\r\nnow, I believe, but for Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has Fledgeby to do with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Knew him. Cautioned me against him before I got into his claws.\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t persuade him then, in behalf of somebody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that Fledgeby has at all softened him towards you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Us, Sophronia. Us, us, us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Towards us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean that the Jew has not yet done what he might have done, and that\r\nFledgeby takes the credit of having got him to hold his hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you believe Fledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, I never believe anybody. I never have, my dear, since I\r\nbelieved you. But it looks like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving given her this back-handed reminder of her mutinous observations\r\nto the skeleton, Mr Lammle rose from table--perhaps, the better to\r\nconceal a smile, and a white dint or two about his nose--and took a turn\r\non the carpet and came to the hearthrug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we could have packed the brute off with Georgiana;--but however;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s spilled milk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Lammle, standing gathering up the skirts of his dressing-gown with\r\nhis back to the fire, said this, looking down at his wife, she turned\r\npale and looked down at the ground. With a sense of disloyalty upon\r\nher, and perhaps with a sense of personal danger--for she was afraid of\r\nhim--even afraid of his hand and afraid of his foot, though he had never\r\ndone her violence--she hastened to put herself right in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we could borrow money, Alfred--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg money, borrow money, or steal money. It would be all one to us,\r\nSophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 her husband struck in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--Then, we could weather this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No doubt. To offer another original and undeniable remark, Sophronia,\r\ntwo and two make four.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, seeing that she was turning something in her mind, he gathered up\r\nthe skirts of his dressing-gown again, and, tucking them under one arm,\r\nand collecting his ample whiskers in his other hand, kept his eye upon\r\nher, silently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is natural, Alfred,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, looking up with some timidity into\r\nhis face, \xe2\x80\x98to think in such an emergency of the richest people we know,\r\nand the simplest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so, Sophronia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Boffins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so, Sophronia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there nothing to be done with them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is there to be done with them, Sophronia?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe cast about in her thoughts again, and he kept his eye upon her as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I have repeatedly thought of the Boffins, Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nresumed, after a fruitless silence; \xe2\x80\x98but I have seen my way to nothing.\r\nThey are well guarded. That infernal Secretary stands between them\r\nand--people of merit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he could be got rid of?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, brightening a little, after more\r\ncasting about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take time, Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 observed her watchful husband, in a patronizing\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If working him out of the way could be presented in the light of a\r\nservice to Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take time, Sophronia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have remarked lately, Alfred, that the old man is turning very\r\nsuspicious and distrustful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miserly too, my dear; which is far the most unpromising for us.\r\nNevertheless, take time, Sophronia, take time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took time and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose we should address ourselves to that tendency in him of which we\r\nhave made ourselves quite sure. Suppose my conscience--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And we know what a conscience it is, my soul. Yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose my conscience should not allow me to keep to myself any\r\nlonger what that upstart girl told me of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s having made a\r\ndeclaration to her. Suppose my conscience should oblige me to repeat it\r\nto Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I rather like that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose I so repeated it to Mr Boffin, as to insinuate that my\r\nsensitive delicacy and honour--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good words, Sophronia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--As to insinuate that OUR sensitive delicacy and honour,\xe2\x80\x99 she resumed,\r\nwith a bitter stress upon the phrase, \xe2\x80\x98would not allow us to be silent\r\nparties to so mercenary and designing a speculation on the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, and so gross a breach of faith towards his confiding employer.\r\nSuppose I had imparted my virtuous uneasiness to my excellent husband,\r\nand he had said, in his integrity, \xe2\x80\x9cSophronia, you must immediately\r\ndisclose this to Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once more, Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Lammle, changing the leg on which he\r\nstood, \xe2\x80\x98I rather like that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remark that he is well guarded,\xe2\x80\x99 she pursued. \xe2\x80\x98I think so too. But\r\nif this should lead to his discharging his Secretary, there would be a\r\nweak place made.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on expounding, Sophronia. I begin to like this very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having, in our unimpeachable rectitude, done him the service of opening\r\nhis eyes to the treachery of the person he trusted, we shall have\r\nestablished a claim upon him and a confidence with him. Whether it\r\ncan be made much of, or little of, we must wait--because we can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nit--to see. Probably we shall make the most of it that is to be made.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Probably,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think it impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, in the same cold plotting way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that you might replace the Secretary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not impossible, Sophronia. It might be brought about. At any rate it\r\nmight be skilfully led up to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe nodded her understanding of the hint, as she looked at the fire. \xe2\x80\x98Mr\r\nLammle,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, musingly: not without a slight ironical touch: \xe2\x80\x98Mr\r\nLammle would be so delighted to do anything in his power. Mr Lammle,\r\nhimself a man of business as well as a capitalist. Mr Lammle, accustomed\r\nto be intrusted with the most delicate affairs. Mr Lammle, who has\r\nmanaged my own little fortune so admirably, but who, to be sure, began\r\nto make his reputation with the advantage of being a man of property,\r\nabove temptation, and beyond suspicion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle smiled, and even patted her on the head. In his sinister\r\nrelish of the scheme, as he stood above her, making it the subject of\r\nhis cogitations, he seemed to have twice as much nose on his face as he\r\nhad ever had in his life.\r\n\r\nHe stood pondering, and she sat looking at the dusty fire without\r\nmoving, for some time. But, the moment he began to speak again she\r\nlooked up with a wince and attended to him, as if that double-dealing of\r\nhers had been in her mind, and the fear were revived in her of his hand\r\nor his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It appears to me, Sophronia, that you have omitted one branch of the\r\nsubject. Perhaps not, for women understand women. We might oust the girl\r\nherself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle shook her head. \xe2\x80\x98She has an immensely strong hold upon them\r\nboth, Alfred. Not to be compared with that of a paid secretary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle, with a crooked smile, \xe2\x80\x98ought to have\r\nbeen open with her benefactor and benefactress. The darling love\r\nought to have reposed unbounded confidence in her benefactor and\r\nbenefactress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSophronia shook her head again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! Women understand women,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, rather disappointed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t press it. It might be the making of our fortune to make a\r\nclean sweep of them both. With me to manage the property, and my wife to\r\nmanage the people--Whew!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain shaking her head, she returned: \xe2\x80\x98They will never quarrel with the\r\ngirl. They will never punish the girl. We must accept the girl, rely\r\nupon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Lammle, shrugging his shoulders, \xe2\x80\x98so be it: only always\r\nremember that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, the sole remaining question is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98when shall I\r\nbegin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot begin too soon, Sophronia. As I have told you, the condition\r\nof our affairs is desperate, and may be blown upon at any moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must secure Mr Boffin alone, Alfred. If his wife was present, she\r\nwould throw oil upon the waters. I know I should fail to move him to an\r\nangry outburst, if his wife was there. And as to the girl herself--as I\r\nam going to betray her confidence, she is equally out of the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to write for an appointment?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, certainly not. They would wonder among themselves why I wrote, and\r\nI want to have him wholly unprepared.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Call, and ask to see him alone?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather not do that either. Leave it to me. Spare me the little\r\ncarriage for to-day, and for to-morrow (if I don\xe2\x80\x99t succeed to-day), and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll lie in wait for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was barely settled when a manly form was seen to pass the windows\r\nand heard to knock and ring. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lammle. \xe2\x80\x98He admires\r\nyou, and has a high opinion of you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be out. Coax him to use his\r\ninfluence with the Jew. His name is Riah, of the House of Pubsey and\r\nCo.\xe2\x80\x99 Adding these words under his breath, lest he should be audible\r\nin the erect ears of Mr Fledgeby, through two keyholes and the hall,\r\nLammle, making signals of discretion to his servant, went softly up\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, giving him a very gracious reception,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98so glad to see you! My poor dear Alfred, who is greatly worried just\r\nnow about his affairs, went out rather early. Dear Mr Fledgeby, do sit\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDear Mr Fledgeby did sit down, and satisfied himself (or, judging from\r\nthe expression of his countenance, DISsatisfied himself) that nothing\r\nnew had occurred in the way of whisker-sprout since he came round the\r\ncorner from the Albany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Mr Fledgeby, it was needless to mention to you that my poor dear\r\nAlfred is much worried about his affairs at present, for he has told me\r\nwhat a comfort you are to him in his temporary difficulties, and what a\r\ngreat service you have rendered him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Mr Fledgeby, trying a new part of his chair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but that Lammle might be reserved about his affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, with deep feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to me, dear Mr Fledgeby. I am his wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I--I always understood so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as the wife of Alfred, may I, dear Mr Fledgeby, wholly without his\r\nauthority or knowledge, as I am sure your discernment will perceive,\r\nentreat you to continue that great service, and once more use your\r\nwell-earned influence with Mr Riah for a little more indulgence? The\r\nname I have heard Alfred mention, tossing in his dreams, IS Riah; is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The name of the Creditor is Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby, with a rather\r\nuncompromising accent on his noun-substantive. \xe2\x80\x98Saint Mary Axe. Pubsey\r\nand Co.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Lammle, clasping her hands with a certain\r\ngushing wildness. \xe2\x80\x98Pubsey and Co.!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The pleading of the feminine--\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Fledgeby began, and there stuck so\r\nlong for a word to get on with, that Mrs Lammle offered him sweetly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98Gender--is ever what a man is bound to listen\r\nto, and I wish it rested with myself. But this Riah is a nasty one, Mrs\r\nLammle; he really is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not if YOU speak to him, dear Mr Fledgeby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my soul and body he is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try. Try once more, dearest Mr Fledgeby. What is there you cannot do,\r\nif you will!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re very complimentary to say so. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind trying him again, at your request. But of course I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nanswer for the consequences. Riah is a tough subject, and when he says\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll do a thing, he\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98and when he says to you he\xe2\x80\x99ll wait,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98She is a devilish clever woman,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that\r\nopening, but she spies it out and cuts into it as soon as it\xe2\x80\x99s made.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In point of fact, dear Mr Fledgeby,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle went on in a very\r\ninteresting manner, \xe2\x80\x98not to affect concealment of Alfred\xe2\x80\x99s hopes, to you\r\nwho are so much his friend, there is a distant break in his horizon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis figure of speech seemed rather mysterious to Fascination Fledgeby,\r\nwho said, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a what in his--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred, dear Mr Fledgeby, discussed with me this very morning before he\r\nwent out, some prospects he has, which might entirely change the aspect\r\nof his present troubles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes!\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mrs Lammle brought her handkerchief into play. \xe2\x80\x98And you\r\nknow, dear Mr Fledgeby--you who study the human heart, and study the\r\nworld--what an affliction it would be to lose position and to lose\r\ncredit, when ability to tide over a very short time might save all\r\nappearances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Then you think, Mrs Lammle, that if Lammle\r\ngot time, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t burst up?--To use an expression,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Fledgeby\r\napologetically explained, \xe2\x80\x98which is adopted in the Money Market.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed yes. Truly, truly, yes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That makes all the difference,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a point of\r\nseeing Riah at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blessings on you, dearest Mr Fledgeby!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. She gave him her hand. \xe2\x80\x98The hand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nFledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98of a lovely and superior-minded female is ever the repayment\r\nof a--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noble action!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, extremely anxious to get rid of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what I was going to say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby, who never would,\r\nunder any circumstances, accept a suggested expression, \xe2\x80\x98but you\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\ncomplimentary. May I imprint a--a one--upon it? Good morning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I may depend upon your promptitude, dearest Mr Fledgeby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSaid Fledgeby, looking back at the door and respectfully kissing his\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x98You may depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mr Fledgeby sped on his errand of mercy through the streets,\r\nat so brisk a rate that his feet might have been winged by all the good\r\nspirits that wait on Generosity. They might have taken up their station\r\nin his breast, too, for he was blithe and merry. There was quite a fresh\r\ntrill in his voice, when, arriving at the counting-house in St Mary Axe,\r\nand finding it for the moment empty, he trolled forth at the foot of the\r\nstaircase: \xe2\x80\x98Now, Judah, what are you up to there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man appeared, with his accustomed deference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, falling back, with a wink. \xe2\x80\x98You mean mischief,\r\nJerusalem!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man raised his eyes inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes you do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you sinner! Oh, you dodger! What!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to act upon that bill of sale at Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s, are you? Nothing\r\nwill turn you, won\xe2\x80\x99t it? You won\xe2\x80\x99t be put off for another single minute,\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOrdered to immediate action by the master\xe2\x80\x99s tone and look, the old man\r\ntook up his hat from the little counter where it lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been told that he might pull through it, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go in\r\nto win, Wide-Awake; have you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98And it\xe2\x80\x99s not your game\r\nthat he should pull through it; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? You having got security, and\r\nthere being enough to pay you? Oh, you Jew!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man stood irresolute and uncertain for a moment, as if there\r\nmight be further instructions for him in reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I go, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 he at length asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Asks me if he is going!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Asks me, as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow his own purpose! Asks me, as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got his hat on ready!\r\nAsks me, as if his sharp old eye--why, it cuts like a knife--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlooking at his walking-stick by the door!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I go, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you go?\xe2\x80\x99 sneered Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, you do go. Toddle, Judah!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nGIVE A DOG A BAD NAME, AND HANG HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nFascination Fledgeby, left alone in the counting-house, strolled about\r\nwith his hat on one side, whistling, and investigating the drawers, and\r\nprying here and there for any small evidences of his being cheated,\r\nbut could find none. \xe2\x80\x98Not his merit that he don\xe2\x80\x99t cheat me,\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s commentary delivered with a wink, \xe2\x80\x98but my precaution.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nthen with a lazy grandeur asserted his rights as lord of Pubsey and\r\nCo. by poking his cane at the stools and boxes, and spitting in the\r\nfireplace, and so loitered royally to the window and looked out into the\r\nnarrow street, with his small eyes just peering over the top of Pubsey\r\nand Co.\xe2\x80\x99s blind. As a blind in more senses than one, it reminded him\r\nthat he was alone in the counting-house with the front door open. He was\r\nmoving away to shut it, lest he should be injudiciously identified with\r\nthe establishment, when he was stopped by some one coming to the door.\r\n\r\nThis some one was the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, with a little basket on her\r\narm, and her crutch stick in her hand. Her keen eyes had espied Mr\r\nFledgeby before Mr Fledgeby had espied her, and he was paralysed in his\r\npurpose of shutting her out, not so much by her approaching the door, as\r\nby her favouring him with a shower of nods, the instant he saw her. This\r\nadvantage she improved by hobbling up the steps with such despatch that\r\nbefore Mr Fledgeby could take measures for her finding nobody at home,\r\nshe was face to face with him in the counting-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hope I see you well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Mr Riah in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFledgeby had dropped into a chair, in the attitude of one waiting\r\nwearily. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose he will be back soon,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied; \xe2\x80\x98he has cut\r\nout and left me expecting him back, in an odd way. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen you\r\nbefore?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once before--if you had your eyesight,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren; the\r\nconditional clause in an under-tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you were carrying on some games up at the top of the house. I\r\nremember. How\xe2\x80\x99s your friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have more friends than one, sir, I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Which\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby, shutting up one eye, \xe2\x80\x98any of your\r\nfriends, all your friends. Are they pretty tolerable?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomewhat confounded, Miss Wren parried the pleasantry, and sat down in a\r\ncorner behind the door, with her basket in her lap. By-and-by, she said,\r\nbreaking a long and patient silence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir, but I am used to find Mr Riah at this time, and\r\nso I generally come at this time. I only want to buy my poor little two\r\nshillings\xe2\x80\x99 worth of waste. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll kindly let me have it, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll trot off to my work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I let you have it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, turning his head towards her; for he\r\nhad been sitting blinking at the light, and feeling his cheek. \xe2\x80\x98Why, you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t really suppose that I have anything to do with the place, or the\r\nbusiness; do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98He said, that day, you were the\r\nmaster!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old cock in black said? Riah said? Why, he\xe2\x80\x99d say anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; but you said so too,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Or at least you took\r\non like the master, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t contradict him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of his dodges,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby, with a cool and contemptuous\r\nshrug. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s made of dodges. He said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cCome up to the top of the\r\nhouse, sir, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a handsome girl. But I shall call you\r\nthe master.\xe2\x80\x9d So I went up to the top of the house and he showed me the\r\nhandsome girl (very well worth looking at she was), and I was called the\r\nmaster. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I dare say he don\xe2\x80\x99t. He loves a dodge for\r\nits own sake; being,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr Fledgeby, after casting about for an\r\nexpressive phrase, \xe2\x80\x98the dodgerest of all the dodgers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my head!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, holding it with both her\r\nhands, as if it were cracking. \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t mean what you say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can, my little woman, retorted Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98and I do, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis repudiation was not only an act of deliberate policy on Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, in case of his being surprised by any other caller, but was also a\r\nretort upon Miss Wren for her over-sharpness, and a pleasant instance\r\nof his humour as regarded the old Jew. \xe2\x80\x98He has got a bad name as an old\r\nJew, and he is paid for the use of it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my money\xe2\x80\x99s worth\r\nout of him.\xe2\x80\x99 This was Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s habitual reflection in the way of\r\nbusiness, and it was sharpened just now by the old man\xe2\x80\x99s presuming\r\nto have a secret from him: though of the secret itself, as annoying\r\nsomebody else whom he disliked, he by no means disapproved.\r\n\r\nMiss Wren with a fallen countenance sat behind the door looking\r\nthoughtfully at the ground, and the long and patient silence had\r\nagain set in for some time, when the expression of Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nbetokened that through the upper portion of the door, which was of\r\nglass, he saw some one faltering on the brink of the counting-house.\r\nPresently there was a rustle and a tap, and then some more rustling and\r\nanother tap. Fledgeby taking no notice, the door was at length softly\r\nopened, and the dried face of a mild little elderly gentleman looked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Riah?\xe2\x80\x99 said this visitor, very politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am waiting for him, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98He went out and left\r\nme here. I expect him back every minute. Perhaps you had better take a\r\nchair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe gentleman took a chair, and put his hand to his forehead, as if\r\nhe were in a melancholy frame of mind. Mr Fledgeby eyed him aside, and\r\nseemed to relish his attitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fine day, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nThe little dried gentleman was so occupied with his own depressed\r\nreflections that he did not notice the remark until the sound of Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s voice had died out of the counting-house. Then he started,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir. I fear you spoke to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Fledgeby, a little louder than before, \xe2\x80\x98it was a fine\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain the little dried gentleman put his hand to his forehead, and again\r\nMr Fledgeby seemed to enjoy his doing it. When the gentleman changed his\r\nattitude with a sigh, Fledgeby spake with a grin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Twemlow, I think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dried gentleman seemed much surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had the pleasure of dining with you at Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Even\r\nhave the honour of being a connexion of yours. An unexpected sort of\r\nplace this to meet in; but one never knows, when one gets into the City,\r\nwhat people one may knock up against. I hope you have your health, and\r\nare enjoying yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere might have been a touch of impertinence in the last words; on the\r\nother hand, it might have been but the native grace of Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner. Mr Fledgeby sat on a stool with a foot on the rail of another\r\nstool, and his hat on. Mr Twemlow had uncovered on looking in at the\r\ndoor, and remained so. Now the conscientious Twemlow, knowing what he\r\nhad done to thwart the gracious Fledgeby, was particularly disconcerted\r\nby this encounter. He was as ill at ease as a gentleman well could be.\r\nHe felt himself bound to conduct himself stiffly towards Fledgeby,\r\nand he made him a distant bow. Fledgeby made his small eyes smaller\r\nin taking special note of his manner. The dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker sat in her\r\ncorner behind the door, with her eyes on the ground and her hands folded\r\non her basket, holding her crutch-stick between them, and appearing to\r\ntake no heed of anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a long time,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Mr Fledgeby, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\ntime may you make it, Mr Twemlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Twemlow made it ten minutes past twelve, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As near as a toucher,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I hope, Mr Twemlow, your\r\nbusiness here may be of a more agreeable character than mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Twemlow.\r\n\r\nFledgeby again made his small eyes smaller, as he glanced with great\r\ncomplacency at Twemlow, who was timorously tapping the table with a\r\nfolded letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I know of Mr Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, with a very disparaging\r\nutterance of his name, \xe2\x80\x98leads me to believe that this is about the shop\r\nfor disagreeable business. I have always found him the bitingest and\r\ntightest screw in London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Twemlow acknowledged the remark with a little distant bow. It\r\nevidently made him nervous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much so,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98that if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be true to a\r\nfriend, nobody should catch me waiting here a single minute. But if you\r\nhave friends in adversity, stand by them. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I say and act up\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe equitable Twemlow felt that this sentiment, irrespective of the\r\nutterer, demanded his cordial assent. \xe2\x80\x98You are very right, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nrejoined with spirit. \xe2\x80\x98You indicate the generous and manly course.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad to have your approbation,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence,\r\nMr Twemlow;\xe2\x80\x99 here he descended from his perch, and sauntered towards\r\nhim; \xe2\x80\x98that the friends I am standing by to-day are the friends at whose\r\nhouse I met you! The Lammles. She\xe2\x80\x99s a very taking and agreeable woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nConscience smote the gentle Twemlow pale. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98She is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when she appealed to me this morning, to come and try what I could\r\ndo to pacify their creditor, this Mr Riah--that I certainly have gained\r\nsome little influence with in transacting business for another friend,\r\nbut nothing like so much as she supposes--and when a woman like that\r\nspoke to me as her dearest Mr Fledgeby, and shed tears--why what could I\r\ndo, you know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow gasped \xe2\x80\x98Nothing but come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but come. And so I came. But why,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, putting\r\nhis hands in his pockets and counterfeiting deep meditation, \xe2\x80\x98why Riah\r\nshould have started up, when I told him that the Lammles entreated him\r\nto hold over a Bill of Sale he has on all their effects; and why he\r\nshould have cut out, saying he would be back directly; and why he should\r\nhave left me here alone so long; I cannot understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous Twemlow, Knight of the Simple Heart, was not in a\r\ncondition to offer any suggestion. He was too penitent, too remorseful.\r\nFor the first time in his life he had done an underhanded action, and he\r\nhad done wrong. He had secretly interposed against this confiding young\r\nman, for no better real reason than because the young man\xe2\x80\x99s ways were\r\nnot his ways.\r\n\r\nBut, the confiding young man proceeded to heap coals of fire on his\r\nsensitive head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Mr Twemlow; you see I am acquainted with the nature\r\nof the affairs that are transacted here. Is there anything I can do for\r\nyou here? You have always been brought up as a gentleman, and never as a\r\nman of business;\xe2\x80\x99 another touch of possible impertinence in this place;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and perhaps you are but a poor man of business. What else is to be\r\nexpected!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am even a poorer man of business than I am a man, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nTwemlow, \xe2\x80\x98and I could hardly express my deficiency in a stronger way. I\r\nreally do not so much as clearly understand my position in the matter\r\non which I am brought here. But there are reasons which make me\r\nvery delicate of accepting your assistance. I am greatly, greatly,\r\ndisinclined to profit by it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGood childish creature! Condemned to a passage through the world by such\r\nnarrow little dimly-lighted ways, and picking up so few specks or spots\r\non the road!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98you may be a little proud of entering on the\r\ntopic,--having been brought up as a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not that, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Twemlow, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s not that. I hope I\r\ndistinguish between true pride and false pride.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no pride at all, myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98and perhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncut things so fine as to know one from t\xe2\x80\x99other. But I know this is a\r\nplace where even a man of business needs his wits about him; and if mine\r\ncan be of any use to you here, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Twemlow, faltering. \xe2\x80\x98But I am most\r\nunwilling--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Fledgeby with an ill-favoured glance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98entertain the vanity of supposing that my wits could be of any use\r\nto you in society, but they might be here. You cultivate society and\r\nsociety cultivates you, but Mr Riah\xe2\x80\x99s not society. In society, Mr Riah\r\nis kept dark; eh, Mr Twemlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow, much disturbed, and with his hand fluttering about his\r\nforehead, replied: \xe2\x80\x98Quite true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe confiding young man besought him to state his case. The innocent\r\nTwemlow, expecting Fledgeby to be astounded by what he should unfold,\r\nand not for an instant conceiving the possibility of its happening every\r\nday, but treating of it as a terrible phenomenon occurring in the course\r\nof ages, related how that he had had a deceased friend, a married civil\r\nofficer with a family, who had wanted money for change of place or\r\nchange of post, and how he, Twemlow, had \xe2\x80\x98given him his name,\xe2\x80\x99 with the\r\nusual, but in the eyes of Twemlow almost incredible result that he had\r\nbeen left to repay what he had never had. How, in the course of years,\r\nhe had reduced the principal by trifling sums, \xe2\x80\x98having,\xe2\x80\x99 said Twemlow,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98always to observe great economy, being in the enjoyment of a fixed\r\nincome limited in extent, and that depending on the munificence of\r\na certain nobleman,\xe2\x80\x99 and had always pinched the full interest out of\r\nhimself with punctual pinches. How he had come, in course of time,\r\nto look upon this one only debt of his life as a regular quarterly\r\ndrawback, and no worse, when \xe2\x80\x98his name\xe2\x80\x99 had some way fallen into the\r\npossession of Mr Riah, who had sent him notice to redeem it by paying up\r\nin full, in one plump sum, or take tremendous consequences. This, with\r\nhazy remembrances of how he had been carried to some office to \xe2\x80\x98confess\r\njudgment\xe2\x80\x99 (as he recollected the phrase), and how he had been carried\r\nto another office where his life was assured for somebody not wholly\r\nunconnected with the sherry trade whom he remembered by the remarkable\r\ncircumstance that he had a Straduarius violin to dispose of, and also a\r\nMadonna, formed the sum and substance of Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s narrative. Through\r\nwhich stalked the shadow of the awful Snigsworth, eyed afar off by\r\nmoney-lenders as Security in the Mist, and menacing Twemlow with his\r\nbaronial truncheon.\r\n\r\nTo all, Mr Fledgeby listened with the modest gravity becoming a\r\nconfiding young man who knew it all beforehand, and, when it was\r\nfinished, seriously shook his head. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like, Mr Twemlow,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nFledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Riah\xe2\x80\x99s calling in the principal. If he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetermined to call it in, it must come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But supposing, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Twemlow, downcast, \xe2\x80\x98that it can\xe2\x80\x99t come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98you must go, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Twemlow, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To prison,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby. Whereat Mr Twemlow leaned his innocent\r\nhead upon his hand, and moaned a little moan of distress and disgrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, appearing to pluck up his spirits, \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll hope\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad as that comes to. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention to Mr\r\nRiah when he comes in, who you are, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him you\xe2\x80\x99re my friend,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll say my say for you, instead of your saying it for yourself; I\r\nmay be able to do it in a more business-like way. You won\xe2\x80\x99t consider it\r\na liberty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thank you again and again, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Twemlow. \xe2\x80\x98I am strong,\r\nstrongly, disinclined to avail myself of your generosity, though my\r\nhelplessness yields. For I cannot but feel that I--to put it in the\r\nmildest form of speech--that I have done nothing to deserve it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where CAN he be?\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Fledgeby, referring to his watch again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What CAN he have gone out for? Did you ever see him, Mr Twemlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a thorough Jew to look at, but he is a more thorough Jew to deal\r\nwith. He\xe2\x80\x99s worst when he\xe2\x80\x99s quiet. If he\xe2\x80\x99s quiet, I shall take it as a\r\nvery bad sign. Keep your eye upon him when he comes in, and, if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquiet, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hopeful. Here he is!--He looks quiet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, which had the effect of causing the harmless Twemlow\r\npainful agitation, Mr Fledgeby withdrew to his former post, and the old\r\nman entered the counting-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Mr Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98I thought you were lost!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man, glancing at the stranger, stood stock-still. He perceived\r\nthat his master was leading up to the orders he was to take, and he\r\nwaited to understand them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really thought,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Fledgeby slowly, \xe2\x80\x98that you were lost, Mr\r\nRiah. Why, now I look at you--but no, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have done it; no, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t have done it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHat in hand, the old man lifted his head, and looked distressfully at\r\nFledgeby as seeking to know what new moral burden he was to bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t have rushed out to get the start of everybody else, and put\r\nin that bill of sale at Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Say you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr\r\nRiah.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, I have,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the old man in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my eye!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Tut, tut, tut! Dear, dear, dear! Well! I\r\nknew you were a hard customer, Mr Riah, but I never thought you were as\r\nhard as that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, with great uneasiness, \xe2\x80\x98I do as I am directed.\r\nI am not the principal here. I am but the agent of a superior, and I\r\nhave no choice, no power.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say so,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Fledgeby, secretly exultant as the old man\r\nstretched out his hands, with a shrinking action of defending himself\r\nagainst the sharp construction of the two observers. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t play the\r\ntune of the trade, Mr Riah. You\xe2\x80\x99ve a right to get in your debts, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re determined to do it, but don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend what every one in your\r\nline regularly pretends. At least, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it to me. Why should you, Mr\r\nRiah? You know I know all about you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man clasped the skirt of his long coat with his disengaged hand,\r\nand directed a wistful look at Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t, I entreat you as a favour, Mr Riah,\r\nbe so devilish meek, for I know what\xe2\x80\x99ll follow if you are. Look here, Mr\r\nRiah. This gentleman is Mr Twemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Jew turned to him and bowed. That poor lamb bowed in return; polite,\r\nand terrified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have made such a failure,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98in trying to do\r\nanything with you for my friend Lammle, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly a hope of doing\r\nanything with you for my friend (and connexion indeed) Mr Twemlow. But\r\nI do think that if you would do a favour for anybody, you would for me,\r\nand I won\xe2\x80\x99t fail for want of trying, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve passed my promise to Mr\r\nTwemlow besides. Now, Mr Riah, here is Mr Twemlow. Always good for his\r\ninterest, always coming up to time, always paying his little way. Now,\r\nwhy should you press Mr Twemlow? You can\xe2\x80\x99t have any spite against Mr\r\nTwemlow! Why not be easy with Mr Twemlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man looked into Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s little eyes for any sign of leave to\r\nbe easy with Mr Twemlow; but there was no sign in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Twemlow is no connexion of yours, Mr Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby; \xe2\x80\x98you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t want to be even with him for having through life gone in for a\r\ngentleman and hung on to his Family. If Mr Twemlow has a contempt for\r\nbusiness, what can it matter to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the gentle victim, \xe2\x80\x98I have not. I should\r\nconsider it presumption.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, Mr Riah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98isn\xe2\x80\x99t that handsomely said? Come! Make\r\nterms with me for Mr Twemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man looked again for any sign of permission to spare the poor\r\nlittle gentleman. No. Mr Fledgeby meant him to be racked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry, Mr Twemlow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riah. \xe2\x80\x98I have my instructions. I am\r\ninvested with no authority for diverging from them. The money must be\r\npaid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In full and slap down, do you mean, Mr Riah?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Fledgeby, to make\r\nthings quite explicit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In full, sir, and at once,\xe2\x80\x99 was Riah\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby shook his head deploringly at Twemlow, and mutely expressed\r\nin reference to the venerable figure standing before him with eyes upon\r\nthe ground: \xe2\x80\x98What a Monster of an Israelite this is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Riah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nThe old man lifted up his eyes once more to the little eyes in Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s head, with some reviving hope that the sign might be coming\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Riah, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use my holding back the fact. There\xe2\x80\x99s a certain\r\ngreat party in the background in Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s case, and you know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it,\xe2\x80\x99 the old man admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it as a plain point of business, Mr Riah. Are you fully\r\ndetermined (as a plain point of business) either to have that said great\r\nparty\xe2\x80\x99s security, or that said great party\xe2\x80\x99s money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fully determined,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riah, as he read his master\xe2\x80\x99s face, and\r\nlearnt the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all caring for, and indeed as it seems to me rather enjoying,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Fledgeby, with peculiar unction, \xe2\x80\x98the precious kick-up and row that\r\nwill come off between Mr Twemlow and the said great party?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis required no answer, and received none. Poor Mr Twemlow, who had\r\nbetrayed the keenest mental terrors since his noble kinsman loomed in\r\nthe perspective, rose with a sigh to take his departure. \xe2\x80\x98I thank you\r\nvery much, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, offering Fledgeby his feverish hand. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\ndone me an unmerited service. Thank you, thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a failure so far, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstay behind, and take another touch at Mr Riah.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do not deceive yourself Mr Twemlow,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Jew, then addressing him\r\ndirectly for the first time. \xe2\x80\x98There is no hope for you. You must expect\r\nno leniency here. You must pay in full, and you cannot pay too promptly,\r\nor you will be put to heavy charges. Trust nothing to me, sir. Money,\r\nmoney, money.\xe2\x80\x99 When he had said these words in an emphatic manner, he\r\nacknowledged Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s still polite motion of his head, and that\r\namiable little worthy took his departure in the lowest spirits.\r\n\r\nFascination Fledgeby was in such a merry vein when the counting-house\r\nwas cleared of him, that he had nothing for it but to go to the window,\r\nand lean his arms on the frame of the blind, and have his silent laugh\r\nout, with his back to his subordinate. When he turned round again with a\r\ncomposed countenance, his subordinate still stood in the same place, and\r\nthe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker sat behind the door with a look of horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re forgetting this young lady, Mr\r\nRiah, and she has been waiting long enough too. Sell her her waste,\r\nplease, and give her good measure if you can make up your mind to do the\r\nliberal thing for once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked on for a time, as the Jew filled her little basket with such\r\nscraps as she was used to buy; but, his merry vein coming on again, he\r\nwas obliged to turn round to the window once more, and lean his arms on\r\nthe blind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, my Cinderella dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man in a whisper, and with a\r\nworn-out look, \xe2\x80\x98the basket\xe2\x80\x99s full now. Bless you! And get you gone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call me your Cinderella dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98O you cruel\r\ngodmother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shook that emphatic little forefinger of hers in his face at\r\nparting, as earnestly and reproachfully as she had ever shaken it at her\r\ngrim old child at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are not the godmother at all!\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98You are the Wolf in\r\nthe Forest, the wicked Wolf! And if ever my dear Lizzie is sold and\r\nbetrayed, I shall know who sold and betrayed her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nMR WEGG PREPARES A GRINDSTONE FOR MR BOFFIN\xe2\x80\x99S NOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving assisted at a few more expositions of the lives of Misers, Mr\r\nVenus became almost indispensable to the evenings at the Bower. The\r\ncircumstance of having another listener to the wonders unfolded by\r\nWegg, or, as it were, another calculator to cast up the guineas found in\r\nteapots, chimneys, racks and mangers, and other such banks of deposit,\r\nseemed greatly to heighten Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment; while Silas Wegg, for\r\nhis part, though of a jealous temperament which might under ordinary\r\ncircumstances have resented the anatomist\xe2\x80\x99s getting into favour, was\r\nso very anxious to keep his eye on that gentleman--lest, being too\r\nmuch left to himself, he should be tempted to play any tricks with the\r\nprecious document in his keeping--that he never lost an opportunity of\r\ncommending him to Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s notice as a third party whose company was\r\nmuch to be desired. Another friendly demonstration towards him Mr Wegg\r\nnow regularly gratified. After each sitting was over, and the patron\r\nhad departed, Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home. To be sure, he as\r\ninvariably requested to be refreshed with a sight of the paper in which\r\nhe was a joint proprietor; but he never failed to remark that it was the\r\ngreat pleasure he derived from Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s improving society which had\r\ninsensibly lured him round to Clerkenwell again, and that, finding\r\nhimself once more attracted to the spot by the social powers of Mr V.,\r\nhe would beg leave to go through that little incidental procedure, as a\r\nmatter of form. \xe2\x80\x98For well I know, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg would add, \xe2\x80\x98that a\r\nman of your delicate mind would wish to be checked off whenever the\r\nopportunity arises, and it is not for me to baulk your feelings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA certain rustiness in Mr Venus, which never became so lubricated by\r\nthe oil of Mr Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and\r\nstiff manner, was very noticeable at about this period. While assisting\r\nat the literary evenings, he even went so far, on two or three\r\noccasions, as to correct Mr Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word,\r\nor made nonsense of a passage; insomuch that Mr Wegg took to surveying\r\nhis course in the day, and to making arrangements for getting round\r\nrocks at night instead of running straight upon them. Of the slightest\r\nanatomical reference he became particularly shy, and, if he saw a bone\r\nahead, would go any distance out of his way rather than mention it by\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe adverse destinies ordained that one evening Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s labouring\r\nbark became beset by polysyllables, and embarrassed among a perfect\r\narchipelago of hard words. It being necessary to take soundings every\r\nminute, and to feel the way with the greatest caution, Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention was fully employed. Advantage was taken of this dilemma by\r\nMr Venus, to pass a scrap of paper into Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and lay his\r\nfinger on his own lip.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Boffin got home at night he found that the paper contained Mr\r\nVenus\xe2\x80\x99s card and these words: \xe2\x80\x98Should be glad to be honoured with a call\r\nrespecting business of your own, about dusk on an early evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe very next evening saw Mr Boffin peeping in at the preserved frogs\r\nin Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s shop-window, and saw Mr Venus espying Mr Boffin with the\r\nreadiness of one on the alert, and beckoning that gentleman into his\r\ninterior. Responding, Mr Boffin was invited to seat himself on the box\r\nof human miscellanies before the fire, and did so, looking round the\r\nplace with admiring eyes. The fire being low and fitful, and the dusk\r\ngloomy, the whole stock seemed to be winking and blinking with both\r\neyes, as Mr Venus did. The French gentleman, though he had no eyes, was\r\nnot at all behind-hand, but appeared, as the flame rose and fell, to\r\nopen and shut his no eyes, with the regularity of the glass-eyed dogs\r\nand ducks and birds. The big-headed babies were equally obliging in\r\nlending their grotesque aid to the general effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Mr Venus, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost no time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Here I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here you are, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like secrecy,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin--\xe2\x80\x98at least, not in a general\r\nway I don\xe2\x80\x99t--but I dare say you\xe2\x80\x99ll show me good reason for being secret\r\nso far.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I shall, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t expect Wegg, I take it for granted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir. I expect no one but the present company.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin glanced about him, as accepting under that inclusive\r\ndenomination the French gentleman and the circle in which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmove, and repeated, \xe2\x80\x98The present company.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus, \xe2\x80\x98before entering upon business, I shall have to\r\nask you for your word and honour that we are in confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s wait a bit and understand what the expression means,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr\r\nBoffin. \xe2\x80\x98In confidence for how long? In confidence for ever and a day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I take your hint, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus; \xe2\x80\x98you think you might consider the\r\nbusiness, when you came to know it, to be of a nature incompatible with\r\nconfidence on your part?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin with a cautious look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, sir. Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Venus, after clutching at his dusty\r\nhair, to brighten his ideas, \xe2\x80\x98let us put it another way. I open the\r\nbusiness with you, relying upon your honour not to do anything in it,\r\nand not to mention me in it, without my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That sounds fair,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I agree to that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have your word and honour, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My good fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98you have my word; and how you\r\ncan have that, without my honour too, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sorted a lot\r\nof dust in my time, but I never knew the two things go into separate\r\nheaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis remark seemed rather to abash Mr Venus. He hesitated, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very true, sir;\xe2\x80\x99 and again, \xe2\x80\x98Very true, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 before resuming the\r\nthread of his discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, if I confess to you that I fell into a proposal of which you\r\nwere the subject, and of which you oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have been the subject,\r\nyou will allow me to mention, and will please take into favourable\r\nconsideration, that I was in a crushed state of mind at the time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Golden Dustman, with his hands folded on the top of his stout\r\nstick, with his chin resting upon them, and with something leering and\r\nwhimsical in his eyes, gave a nod, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Quite so, Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That proposal, sir, was a conspiring breach of your confidence, to\r\nsuch an extent, that I ought at once to have made it known to you. But I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr Boffin, and I fell into it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout moving eye or finger, Mr Boffin gave another nod, and placidly\r\nrepeated, \xe2\x80\x98Quite so, Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I was ever hearty in it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 the penitent anatomist went\r\non, \xe2\x80\x98or that I ever viewed myself with anything but reproach for having\r\nturned out of the paths of science into the paths of--\xe2\x80\x99 he was going\r\nto say \xe2\x80\x98villany,\xe2\x80\x99 but, unwilling to press too hard upon himself,\r\nsubstituted with great emphasis--\xe2\x80\x98Weggery.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPlacid and whimsical of look as ever, Mr Boffin answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite so, Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98having prepared your mind in the rough, I\r\nwill articulate the details.\xe2\x80\x99 With which brief professional exordium, he\r\nentered on the history of the friendly move, and truly recounted it. One\r\nmight have thought that it would have extracted some show of surprise or\r\nanger, or other emotion, from Mr Boffin, but it extracted nothing beyond\r\nhis former comment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite so, Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have astonished you, sir, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus, pausing\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin simply answered as aforesaid: \xe2\x80\x98Quite so, Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy this time the astonishment was all on the other side. It did not,\r\nhowever, so continue. For, when Venus passed to Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s discovery, and\r\nfrom that to their having both seen Mr Boffin dig up the Dutch bottle,\r\nthat gentleman changed colour, changed his attitude, became extremely\r\nrestless, and ended (when Venus ended) by being in a state of manifest\r\nanxiety, trepidation, and confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, finishing off; \xe2\x80\x98you best know what was in that\r\nDutch bottle, and why you dug it up, and took it away. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nto know anything more about it than I saw. All I know is this: I am\r\nproud of my calling after all (though it has been attended by one\r\ndreadful drawback which has told upon my heart, and almost equally upon\r\nmy skeleton), and I mean to live by my calling. Putting the same meaning\r\ninto other words, I do not mean to turn a single dishonest penny by this\r\naffair. As the best amends I can make you for having ever gone into it,\r\nI make known to you, as a warning, what Wegg has found out. My opinion\r\nis, that Wegg is not to be silenced at a modest price, and I build that\r\nopinion on his beginning to dispose of your property the moment he knew\r\nhis power. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s worth your while to silence him at any price,\r\nyou will decide for yourself, and take your measures accordingly. As\r\nfar as I am concerned, I have no price. If I am ever called upon for\r\nthe truth, I tell it, but I want to do no more than I have now done and\r\nended.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with a hearty grip of his hand;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus!\xe2\x80\x99 And then walked up and down the\r\nlittle shop in great agitation. \xe2\x80\x98But look here, Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 he by-and-by\r\nresumed, nervously sitting down again; \xe2\x80\x98if I have to buy Wegg up, I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t buy him any cheaper for your being out of it. Instead of his\r\nhaving half the money--it was to have been half, I suppose? Share and\r\nshare alike?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was to have been half, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Instead of that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll now have all. I shall pay the same, if not more.\r\nFor you tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s an unconscionable dog, a ravenous rascal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 insinuated Mr Boffin, after looking at the\r\nfire for a while--\xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel as if--you might like to pretend to be\r\nin it till Wegg was bought up, and then ease your mind by handing over\r\nto me what you had made believe to pocket?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No I don\xe2\x80\x99t, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus, very positively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to make amends?\xe2\x80\x99 insinuated Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir. It seems to me, after maturely thinking it over, that the best\r\namends for having got out of the square is to get back into the square.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humph!\xe2\x80\x99 mused Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98When you say the square, you mean--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, stoutly and shortly, \xe2\x80\x98the right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It appears to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, grumbling over the fire in an\r\ninjured manner, \xe2\x80\x98that the right is with me, if it\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere. I have\r\nmuch more right to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s money than the Crown can ever have.\r\nWhat was the Crown to him except the King\xe2\x80\x99s Taxes? Whereas, me and my\r\nwife, we was all in all to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus, with his head upon his hands, rendered melancholy by the\r\ncontemplation of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s avarice, only murmured to steep himself\r\nin the luxury of that frame of mind: \xe2\x80\x98She did not wish so to regard\r\nherself, nor yet to be so regarded.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how am I to live,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, piteously, \xe2\x80\x98if I\xe2\x80\x99m to be going\r\nbuying fellows up out of the little that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got? And how am I to set\r\nabout it? When am I to get my money ready? When am I to make a bid? You\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t told me when he threatens to drop down upon me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus explained under what conditions, and with what views, the dropping\r\ndown upon Mr Boffin was held over until the Mounds should be cleared\r\naway. Mr Boffin listened attentively. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, with a\r\ngleam of hope, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about the genuineness and date of this\r\nconfounded will?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None whatever,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where might it be deposited at present?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, in a\r\nwheedling tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s in my possession, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it?\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, with great eagerness. \xe2\x80\x98Now, for any liberal sum of\r\nmoney that could be agreed upon, Venus, would you put it in the fire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor pass it over to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would be the same thing. No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Venus.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Dustman seemed about to pursue these questions, when a\r\nstumping noise was heard outside, coming towards the door. \xe2\x80\x98Hush! here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWegg!\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Get behind the young alligator in the corner, Mr\r\nBoffin, and judge him for yourself. I won\xe2\x80\x99t light a candle till he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone; there\xe2\x80\x99ll only be the glow of the fire; Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s well acquainted with\r\nthe alligator, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t take particular notice of him. Draw your\r\nlegs in, Mr Boffin, at present I see a pair of shoes at the end of his\r\ntail. Get your head well behind his smile, Mr Boffin, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll lie\r\ncomfortable there; you\xe2\x80\x99ll find plenty of room behind his smile. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle dusty, but he\xe2\x80\x99s very like you in tone. Are you right, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin had but whispered an affirmative response, when Wegg came\r\nstumping in. \xe2\x80\x98Partner,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman in a sprightly manner,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98how\xe2\x80\x99s yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tolerable,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Not much to boast of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In-deed!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg: \xe2\x80\x98sorry, partner, that you\xe2\x80\x99re not picking up\r\nfaster, but your soul\xe2\x80\x99s too large for your body, sir; that\xe2\x80\x99s where\r\nit is. And how\xe2\x80\x99s our stock in trade, partner? Safe bind, safe find,\r\npartner? Is that about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you wish to see it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you please, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x98I wish to see\r\nit jintly with yourself. Or, in similar words to some that was set to\r\nmusic some time back:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to see it with your eyes,\r\n     And I will pledge with mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTurning his back and turning a key, Mr Venus produced the document,\r\nholding on by his usual corner. Mr Wegg, holding on by the opposite\r\ncorner, sat down on the seat so lately vacated by Mr Boffin, and looked\r\nit over. \xe2\x80\x98All right, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he slowly and unwillingly admitted, in his\r\nreluctance to loose his hold, \xe2\x80\x98all right!\xe2\x80\x99 And greedily watched his\r\npartner as he turned his back again, and turned his key again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, resuming his low chair\r\nbehind the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes there is, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wegg; \xe2\x80\x98there was something new this\r\nmorning. That foxey old grasper and griper--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Venus, with a glance towards the alligator\xe2\x80\x99s yard\r\nor two of smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mister be blowed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg, yielding to his honest indignation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boffin. Dusty Boffin. That foxey old grunter and grinder, sir, turns\r\ninto the yard this morning, to meddle with our property, a menial tool\r\nof his own, a young man by the name of Sloppy. Ecod, when I say to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want here, young man? This is a private yard,\xe2\x80\x9d he pulls out\r\na paper from Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s other blackguard, the one I was passed over for.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is to authorize Sloppy to overlook the carting and to watch the\r\nwork.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty strong, I think, Mr Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Remember he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know yet of our claim on the property,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested\r\nVenus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he must have a hint of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98and a strong one that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\njog his terrors a bit. Give him an inch, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take an ell. Let him\r\nalone this time, and what\xe2\x80\x99ll he do with our property next? I tell you\r\nwhat, Mr Venus; it comes to this; I must be overbearing with Boffin, or\r\nI shall fly into several pieces. I can\xe2\x80\x99t contain myself when I look\r\nat him. Every time I see him putting his hand in his pocket, I see him\r\nputting it into my pocket. Every time I hear him jingling his money, I\r\nhear him taking liberties with my money. Flesh and blood can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it.\r\nNo,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Wegg, greatly exasperated, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go further. A wooden\r\nleg can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Venus, \xe2\x80\x98it was your own idea that he should not be\r\nexploded upon, till the Mounds were carted away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it was likewise my idea, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98that if he came\r\nsneaking and sniffing about the property, he should be threatened, given\r\nto understand that he has no right to it, and be made our slave. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat my idea, Mr Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It certainly was, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It certainly was, as you say, partner,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Wegg, put into\r\na better humour by the ready admission. \xe2\x80\x98Very well. I consider his\r\nplanting one of his menial tools in the yard, an act of sneaking and\r\nsniffing. And his nose shall be put to the grindstone for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not your fault, Mr Wegg, I must admit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98that he got\r\noff with the Dutch bottle that night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you handsomely say again, partner! No, it was not my fault. I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nhad that bottle out of him. Was it to be borne that he should come, like\r\na thief in the dark, digging among stuff that was far more ours than his\r\n(seeing that we could deprive him of every grain of it, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy\r\nus at our own figure), and carrying off treasure from its bowels? No,\r\nit was not to be borne. And for that, too, his nose shall be put to the\r\ngrindstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you propose to do it, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To put his nose to the grindstone? I propose,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that estimable\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x98to insult him openly. And, if looking into this eye of mine, he\r\ndares to offer a word in answer, to retort upon him before he can take\r\nhis breath, \xe2\x80\x9cAdd another word to that, you dusty old dog, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nbeggar.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose he says nothing, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98we shall have come to an understanding with very\r\nlittle trouble, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll break him and drive him, Mr Venus. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put\r\nhim in harness, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear him up tight, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll break him and drive\r\nhim. The harder the old Dust is driven, sir, the higher he\xe2\x80\x99ll pay. And I\r\nmean to be paid high, Mr Venus, I promise you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You speak quite revengefully, Mr Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Revengefully, sir? Is it for him that I have declined and falled,\r\nnight after night? Is it for his pleasure that I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited at home of an\r\nevening, like a set of skittles, to be set up and knocked over, set up\r\nand knocked over, by whatever balls--or books--he chose to bring against\r\nme? Why, I\xe2\x80\x99m a hundred times the man he is, sir; five hundred times!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was with the malicious intent of urging him on to his worst\r\nthat Mr Venus looked as if he doubted that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Was it outside the house at present ockypied, to its disgrace,\r\nby that minion of fortune and worm of the hour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, falling back\r\nupon his strongest terms of reprobation, and slapping the counter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I, Silas Wegg, five hundred times the man he ever was, sat in all\r\nweathers, waiting for a errand or a customer? Was it outside that very\r\nhouse as I first set eyes upon him, rolling in the lap of luxury, when I\r\nwas selling halfpenny ballads there for a living? And am I to grovel in\r\nthe dust for HIM to walk over? No!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a grin upon the ghastly countenance of the French gentleman\r\nunder the influence of the firelight, as if he were computing how many\r\nthousand slanderers and traitors array themselves against the fortunate,\r\non premises exactly answering to those of Mr Wegg. One might have\r\nfancied that the big-headed babies were toppling over with their\r\nhydrocephalic attempts to reckon up the children of men who transform\r\ntheir benefactors into their injurers by the same process. The yard or\r\ntwo of smile on the part of the alligator might have been invested with\r\nthe meaning, \xe2\x80\x98All about this was quite familiar knowledge down in the\r\ndepths of the slime, ages ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, possibly with some slight perception to the foregoing\r\neffect, \xe2\x80\x98your speaking countenance remarks, Mr Venus, that I\xe2\x80\x99m duller\r\nand savager than usual. Perhaps I HAVE allowed myself to brood too much.\r\nBegone, dull Care! \xe2\x80\x98Tis gone, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked in upon you, and empire\r\nresumes her sway. For, as the song says--subject to your correction,\r\nsir--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the heart of a man is depressed with cares,\r\n     The mist is dispelled if Venus appears.\r\n     Like the notes of a fiddle, you sweetly, sir, sweetly,\r\n     Raises our spirits and charms our ears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGood-night, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall have a word or two to say to you, Mr Wegg, before long,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nremarked Venus, \xe2\x80\x98respecting my share in the project we\xe2\x80\x99ve been speaking\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My time, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98is yours. In the meanwhile let it be\r\nfully understood that I shall not neglect bringing the grindstone to\r\nbear, nor yet bringing Dusty Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s nose to it. His nose once brought\r\nto it, shall be held to it by these hands, Mr Venus, till the sparks\r\nflies out in showers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this agreeable promise Wegg stumped out, and shut the shop-door\r\nafter him. \xe2\x80\x98Wait till I light a candle, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come out more comfortable.\xe2\x80\x99 So, he lighting a candle and holding\r\nit up at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, Mr Boffin disengaged himself from behind the\r\nalligator\xe2\x80\x99s smile, with an expression of countenance so very downcast\r\nthat it not only appeared as if the alligator had the whole of the joke\r\nto himself, but further as if it had been conceived and executed at Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a treacherous fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, dusting his arms and legs\r\nas he came forth, the alligator having been but musty company. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndreadful fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The alligator, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Venus, no. The Serpent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll have the goodness to notice, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Venus, \xe2\x80\x98that I\r\nsaid nothing to him about my going out of the affair altogether, because\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to take you anyways by surprise. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t be too soon\r\nout of it for my satisfaction, Mr Boffin, and I now put it to you when\r\nit will suit your views for me to retire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreturned Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. He\xe2\x80\x99ll drop down on me any\r\nway. He seems fully determined to drop down; don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus opined that such was clearly his intention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might be a sort of protection for me, if you remained in it,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98you might stand betwixt him and me, and take the edge off\r\nhim. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel as if you could make a show of remaining in it,\r\nVenus, till I had time to turn myself round?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus naturally inquired how long Mr Boffin thought it might take him to\r\nturn himself round?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer, given quite at a loss.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything is so at sixes and sevens. If I had never come into the\r\nproperty, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded. But being in it, it would be very\r\ntrying to be turned out; now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you acknowledge that it would,\r\nVenus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus preferred, he said, to leave Mr Boffin to arrive at his own\r\nconclusions on that delicate question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98If I ask advice of\r\nany one else, it\xe2\x80\x99s only letting in another person to be bought out, and\r\nthen I shall be ruined that way, and might as well have given up the\r\nproperty and gone slap to the workhouse. If I was to take advice of my\r\nyoung man, Rokesmith, I should have to buy HIM out. Sooner or later, of\r\ncourse, he\xe2\x80\x99d drop down upon me, like Wegg. I was brought into the world\r\nto be dropped down upon, it appears to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus listened to these lamentations in silence, while Mr Boffin\r\njogged to and fro, holding his pockets as if he had a pain in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t said what you mean to do yourself, Venus. When\r\nyou do go out of it, how do you mean to go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus replied that as Wegg had found the document and handed it to him,\r\nit was his intention to hand it back to Wegg, with the declaration that\r\nhe himself would have nothing to say to it, or do with it, and that Wegg\r\nmust act as he chose, and take the consequences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then he drops down with his whole weight upon ME!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin,\r\nruefully. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner be dropped upon by you than by him, or even by you\r\njintly, than by him alone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus could only repeat that it was his fixed intention to betake\r\nhimself to the paths of science, and to walk in the same all the days\r\nof his life; not dropping down upon his fellow-creatures until they were\r\ndeceased, and then only to articulate them to the best of his humble\r\nability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long could you be persuaded to keep up the appearance of remaining\r\nin it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, retiring on his other idea. \xe2\x80\x98Could you be got\r\nto do so, till the Mounds are gone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo. That would protract the mental uneasiness of Mr Venus too long, he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not if I was to show you reason now?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98not if I was\r\nto show you good and sufficient reason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf by good and sufficient reason Mr Boffin meant honest and\r\nunimpeachable reason, that might weigh with Mr Venus against his\r\npersonal wishes and convenience. But he must add that he saw no opening\r\nto the possibility of such reason being shown him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come and see me, Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98at my house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the reason there, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Venus, with an incredulous smile\r\nand blink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It may be, or may not be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98just as you view it. But\r\nin the meantime don\xe2\x80\x99t go out of the matter. Look here. Do this. Give me\r\nyour word that you won\xe2\x80\x99t take any steps with Wegg, without my knowledge,\r\njust as I have given you my word that I won\xe2\x80\x99t without yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Done, Mr Boffin!\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, after brief consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus! Done!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When shall I come to see you, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you like. The sooner the better. I must be going now. Good-night,\r\nVenus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And good-night to the rest of the present company,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin,\r\nglancing round the shop. \xe2\x80\x98They make a queer show, Venus, and I should\r\nlike to be better acquainted with them some day. Good-night, Venus,\r\ngood-night! Thankee, Venus, thankee, Venus!\xe2\x80\x99 With that he jogged out\r\ninto the street, and jogged upon his homeward way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 he meditated as he went along, nursing his stick,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98whether it can be, that Venus is setting himself to get the better of\r\nWegg? Whether it can be, that he means, when I have bought Wegg out, to\r\nhave me all to himself and to pick me clean to the bones!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a cunning and suspicious idea, quite in the way of his school\r\nof Misers, and he looked very cunning and suspicious as he went jogging\r\nthrough the streets. More than once or twice, more than twice or thrice,\r\nsay half a dozen times, he took his stick from the arm on which he\r\nnursed it, and hit a straight sharp rap at the air with its head.\r\nPossibly the wooden countenance of Mr Silas Wegg was incorporeally\r\nbefore him at those moments, for he hit with intense satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe was within a few streets of his own house, when a little private\r\ncarriage, coming in the contrary direction, passed him, turned round,\r\nand passed him again. It was a little carriage of eccentric movement,\r\nfor again he heard it stop behind him and turn round, and again he saw\r\nit pass him. Then it stopped, and then went on, out of sight. But, not\r\nfar out of sight, for, when he came to the corner of his own street,\r\nthere it stood again.\r\n\r\nThere was a lady\xe2\x80\x99s face at the window as he came up with this carriage,\r\nand he was passing it when the lady softly called to him by his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, coming to a stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is Mrs Lammle,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin went up to the window, and hoped Mrs Lammle was well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not very well, dear Mr Boffin; I have fluttered myself by\r\nbeing--perhaps foolishly--uneasy and anxious. I have been waiting for\r\nyou some time. Can I speak to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin proposed that Mrs Lammle should drive on to his house, a few\r\nhundred yards further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather not, Mr Boffin, unless you particularly wish it. I feel\r\nthe difficulty and delicacy of the matter so much that I would rather\r\navoid speaking to you at your own home. You must think this very\r\nstrange?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin said no, but meant yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is because I am so grateful for the good opinion of all my\r\nfriends, and am so touched by it, that I cannot bear to run the risk of\r\nforfeiting it in any case, even in the cause of duty. I have asked my\r\nhusband (my dear Alfred, Mr Boffin) whether it is the cause of duty,\r\nand he has most emphatically said Yes. I wish I had asked him sooner. It\r\nwould have spared me much distress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Can this be more dropping down upon me!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr Boffin, quite\r\nbewildered.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was Alfred who sent me to you, Mr Boffin. Alfred said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome back, Sophronia, until you have seen Mr Boffin, and told him all.\r\nWhatever he may think of it, he ought certainly to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d Would you\r\nmind coming into the carriage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin answered, \xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 and took his seat at Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drive slowly anywhere,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle called to her coachman, \xe2\x80\x98and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet the carriage rattle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It MUST be more dropping down, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin to himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What next?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN DUSTMAN AT HIS WORST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breakfast table at Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s was usually a very pleasant one, and\r\nwas always presided over by Bella. As though he began each new day in\r\nhis healthy natural character, and some waking hours were necessary to\r\nhis relapse into the corrupting influences of his wealth, the face and\r\nthe demeanour of the Golden Dustman were generally unclouded at that\r\nmeal. It would have been easy to believe then, that there was no change\r\nin him. It was as the day went on that the clouds gathered, and the\r\nbrightness of the morning became obscured. One might have said that the\r\nshadows of avarice and distrust lengthened as his own shadow lengthened,\r\nand that the night closed around him gradually.\r\n\r\nBut, one morning long afterwards to be remembered, it was black midnight\r\nwith the Golden Dustman when he first appeared. His altered character\r\nhad never been so grossly marked. His bearing towards his Secretary was\r\nso charged with insolent distrust and arrogance, that the latter rose\r\nand left the table before breakfast was half done. The look he directed\r\nat the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s retiring figure was so cunningly malignant, that\r\nBella would have sat astounded and indignant, even though he had not\r\ngone the length of secretly threatening Rokesmith with his clenched\r\nfist as he closed the door. This unlucky morning, of all mornings in the\r\nyear, was the morning next after Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Mrs Lammle\r\nin her little carriage.\r\n\r\nBella looked to Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face for comment on, or explanation of,\r\nthis stormy humour in her husband, but none was there. An anxious and\r\na distressed observation of her own face was all she could read in it.\r\nWhen they were left alone together--which was not until noon, for Mr\r\nBoffin sat long in his easy-chair, by turns jogging up and down\r\nthe breakfast-room, clenching his fist and muttering--Bella, in\r\nconsternation, asked her what had happened, what was wrong? \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nforbidden to speak to you about it, Bella dear; I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwas all the answer she could get. And still, whenever, in her wonder and\r\ndismay, she raised her eyes to Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face, she saw in it the same\r\nanxious and distressed observation of her own.\r\n\r\nOppressed by her sense that trouble was impending, and lost in\r\nspeculations why Mrs Boffin should look at her as if she had any part in\r\nit, Bella found the day long and dreary. It was far on in the afternoon\r\nwhen, she being in her own room, a servant brought her a message from Mr\r\nBoffin begging her to come to his.\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin was there, seated on a sofa, and Mr Boffin was jogging up and\r\ndown. On seeing Bella he stopped, beckoned her to him, and drew her arm\r\nthrough his. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, gently; \xe2\x80\x98I am not\r\nangry with you. Why you actually tremble! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, Bella my\r\ndear. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you righted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See me righted?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bella. And then repeated aloud in a tone of\r\nastonishment: \xe2\x80\x98see me righted, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98See you righted. Send Mr Rokesmith here, you\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella would have been lost in perplexity if there had been pause\r\nenough; but the servant found Mr Rokesmith near at hand, and he almost\r\nimmediately presented himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shut the door, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I have got something to say to\r\nyou which I fancy you\xe2\x80\x99ll not be pleased to hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to reply, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary, as, having\r\nclosed the door, he turned and faced him, \xe2\x80\x98that I think that very\r\nlikely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 blustered Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean that it has become no novelty to me to hear from your lips what\r\nI would rather not hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Perhaps we shall change that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin with a threatening\r\nroll of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary. He was quiet and respectful; but\r\nstood, as Bella thought (and was glad to think), on his manhood too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98look at this young lady on my arm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella involuntarily raising her eyes, when this sudden reference was\r\nmade to herself, met those of Mr Rokesmith. He was pale and seemed\r\nagitated. Then her eyes passed on to Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s, and she met the look\r\nagain. In a flash it enlightened her, and she began to understand what\r\nshe had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say to you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin repeated, \xe2\x80\x98look at this young lady on my\r\narm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary.\r\n\r\nAs his glance rested again on Bella for a moment, she thought there was\r\nreproach in it. But it is possible that the reproach was within herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dare you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98tamper, unknown to me, with this\r\nyoung lady? How dare you come out of your station, and your place in my\r\nhouse, to pester this young lady with your impudent addresses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must decline to answer questions,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98that are so\r\noffensively asked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You decline to answer?\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98You decline to answer,\r\ndo you? Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is, Rokesmith; I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for you.\r\nThere are two sides to this matter, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take \xe2\x80\x98em separately. The\r\nfirst side is, sheer Insolence. That\xe2\x80\x99s the first side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Secretary smiled with some bitterness, as though he would have said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I see and hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was sheer Insolence in you, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98even to\r\nthink of this young lady. This young lady was far above YOU. This young\r\nlady was no match for YOU. This young lady was lying in wait (as she was\r\nqualified to do) for money, and you had no money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella hung her head and seemed to shrink a little from Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotecting arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you, I should like to know,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that you were\r\nto have the audacity to follow up this young lady? This young lady was\r\nlooking about the market for a good bid; she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it to be snapped\r\nup by fellows that had no money to lay out; nothing to buy with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr Boffin! Mrs Boffin, pray say something for me!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Bella,\r\ndisengaging her arm, and covering her face with her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, anticipating his wife, \xe2\x80\x98you hold your\r\ntongue. Bella, my dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t you let yourself be put out. I\xe2\x80\x99ll right\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t, you don\xe2\x80\x99t right me!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Bella, with great\r\nemphasis. \xe2\x80\x98You wrong me, wrong me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be put out, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 complacently retorted Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring this young man to book. Now, you Rokesmith! You can\xe2\x80\x99t decline\r\nto hear, you know, as well as to answer. You hear me tell you that the\r\nfirst side of your conduct was Insolence--Insolence and Presumption.\r\nAnswer me one thing, if you can. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t this young lady tell you so\r\nherself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I, Mr Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella with her face still covered. \xe2\x80\x98O say,\r\nMr Rokesmith! Did I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be distressed, Miss Wilfer; it matters very little now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! You can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it, though!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with a knowing shake of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I have asked him to forgive me since,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella; \xe2\x80\x98and I would\r\nask him to forgive me now again, upon my knees, if it would spare him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mrs Boffin broke out a-crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98stop that noise! Tender-hearted in you,\r\nMiss Bella; but I mean to have it out right through with this young man,\r\nhaving got him into a corner. Now, you Rokesmith. I tell you that\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nside of your conduct--Insolence and Presumption. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming to\r\nthe other, which is much worse. This was a speculation of yours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I indignantly deny it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s of no use your denying it; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t signify a bit whether\r\nyou deny it or not; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a head upon my shoulders, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s. What!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, gathering himself together in his most\r\nsuspicious attitude, and wrinkling his face into a very map of curves\r\nand corners. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know what grabs are made at a man with money? If\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my eyes open, and my pockets buttoned, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nbe brought to the workhouse before I knew where I was? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nexperience of Dancer, and Elwes, and Hopkins, and Blewbury Jones, and\r\never so many more of \xe2\x80\x98em, similar to mine? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t everybody want to make\r\ngrabs at what they\xe2\x80\x99d got, and bring \xe2\x80\x98em to poverty and ruin? Weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey forced to hide everything belonging to \xe2\x80\x98em, for fear it should be\r\nsnatched from \xe2\x80\x98em? Of course they was. I shall be told next that they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know human natur!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They! Poor creatures,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, snapping at him. \xe2\x80\x98However, you\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t be at the trouble of repeating it, for it ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth hearing,\r\nand won\xe2\x80\x99t go down with ME. I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to unfold your plan, before this\r\nyoung lady; I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to show this young lady the second view of you;\r\nand nothing you can say will stave it off. (Now, attend here, Bella, my\r\ndear.) Rokesmith, you\xe2\x80\x99re a needy chap. You\xe2\x80\x99re a chap that I pick up in\r\nthe street. Are you, or ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on, Mr Boffin; don\xe2\x80\x99t appeal to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not appeal to YOU,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Boffin as if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done so. \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\nI should hope not! Appealing to YOU, would be rather a rum course. As I\r\nwas saying, you\xe2\x80\x99re a needy chap that I pick up in the street. You come\r\nand ask me in the street to take you for a Secretary, and I take you.\r\nVery good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very bad,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, snapping at him again.\r\n\r\nHe returned no answer. Mr Boffin, after eyeing him with a comical look\r\nof discomfited curiosity, was fain to begin afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This Rokesmith is a needy young man that I take for my Secretary out\r\nof the open street. This Rokesmith gets acquainted with my affairs, and\r\ngets to know that I mean to settle a sum of money on this young lady.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d says this Rokesmith;\xe2\x80\x99 here Mr Boffin clapped a finger against\r\nhis nose, and tapped it several times with a sneaking air, as embodying\r\nRokesmith confidentially confabulating with his own nose; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThis will\r\nbe a good haul; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in for this!\xe2\x80\x9d And so this Rokesmith, greedy and\r\nhungering, begins a-creeping on his hands and knees towards the money.\r\nNot so bad a speculation either: for if this young lady had had less\r\nspirit, or had had less sense, through being at all in the romantic\r\nline, by George he might have worked it out and made it pay! But\r\nfortunately she was too many for him, and a pretty figure he cuts now\r\nhe is exposed. There he stands!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, addressing Rokesmith\r\nhimself with ridiculous inconsistency. \xe2\x80\x98Look at him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your unfortunate suspicions, Mr Boffin--\xe2\x80\x99 began the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precious unfortunate for you, I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--are not to be combated by any one, and I address myself to no such\r\nhopeless task. But I will say a word upon the truth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yah! Much you care about the truth,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with a snap of his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noddy! My dear love!\xe2\x80\x99 expostulated his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98you keep still. I say to this Rokesmith\r\nhere, much he cares about the truth. I tell him again, much he cares\r\nabout the truth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our connexion being at an end, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x98it can\r\nbe of very little moment to me what you say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! You are knowing enough,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Boffin, with a sly look, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nhave found out that our connexion\xe2\x80\x99s at an end, eh? But you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nbeforehand with me. Look at this in my hand. This is your pay, on your\r\ndischarge. You can only follow suit. You can\xe2\x80\x99t deprive me of the lead.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s have no pretending that you discharge yourself. I discharge you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So that I go,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the Secretary, waving the point aside with his\r\nhand, \xe2\x80\x98it is all one to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s two to me, let me tell you.\r\nAllowing a fellow that\xe2\x80\x99s found out, to discharge himself, is one thing;\r\ndischarging him for insolence and presumption, and likewise for designs\r\nupon his master\xe2\x80\x99s money, is another. One and one\xe2\x80\x99s two; not one. (Old\r\nlady, don\xe2\x80\x99t you cut in. You keep still.)\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you said all you wish to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I have or not,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98It depends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you will consider whether there are any other strong\r\nexpressions that you would like to bestow upon me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll consider that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, obstinately, \xe2\x80\x98at my convenience,\r\nand not at yours. You want the last word. It may not be suitable to let\r\nyou have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noddy! My dear, dear Noddy! You sound so hard!\xe2\x80\x99 cried poor Mrs Boffin,\r\nnot to be quite repressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, but without harshness, \xe2\x80\x98if you cut in when\r\nrequested not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a pillow and carry you out of the room upon it.\r\nWhat do you want to say, you Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To you, Mr Boffin, nothing. But to Miss Wilfer and to your good kind\r\nwife, a word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Out with it then,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and cut it short, for we\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\nenough of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have borne,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98with my false\r\nposition here, that I might not be separated from Miss Wilfer. To be\r\nnear her, has been a recompense to me from day to day, even for the\r\nundeserved treatment I have had here, and for the degraded aspect in\r\nwhich she has often seen me. Since Miss Wilfer rejected me, I have never\r\nagain urged my suit, to the best of my belief, with a spoken syllable or\r\na look. But I have never changed in my devotion to her, except--if she\r\nwill forgive my saying so--that it is deeper than it was, and better\r\nfounded.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, mark this chap\xe2\x80\x99s saying Miss Wilfer, when he means L.s.d.!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nMr Boffin, with a cunning wink. \xe2\x80\x98Now, mark this chap\xe2\x80\x99s making Miss\r\nWilfer stand for Pounds, Shillings, and Pence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My feeling for Miss Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the Secretary, without deigning to\r\nnotice him, \xe2\x80\x98is not one to be ashamed of. I avow it. I love her. Let\r\nme go where I may when I presently leave this house, I shall go into a\r\nblank life, leaving her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leaving L.s.d. behind me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, by way of commentary, with\r\nanother wink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I am incapable,\xe2\x80\x99 the Secretary went on, still without heeding him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98of a mercenary project, or a mercenary thought, in connexion with Miss\r\nWilfer, is nothing meritorious in me, because any prize that I could\r\nput before my fancy would sink into insignificance beside her. If\r\nthe greatest wealth or the highest rank were hers, it would only be\r\nimportant in my sight as removing her still farther from me, and making\r\nme more hopeless, if that could be. Say,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the Secretary,\r\nlooking full at his late master, \xe2\x80\x98say that with a word she could strip\r\nMr Boffin of his fortune and take possession of it, she would be of no\r\ngreater worth in my eyes than she is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think by this time, old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, turning to\r\nhis wife in a bantering tone, \xe2\x80\x98about this Rokesmith here, and his caring\r\nfor the truth? You needn\xe2\x80\x99t say what you think, my dear, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you to cut in, but you can think it all the same. As to taking\r\npossession of my property, I warrant you he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that himself if\r\nhe could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Secretary, with another full look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x99 laughed Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like a good \xe2\x80\x98un while\r\nyou ARE about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been for a moment,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Secretary, turning from him and\r\nfalling into his former manner, \xe2\x80\x98diverted from the little I have to say.\r\nMy interest in Miss Wilfer began when I first saw her; even began when I\r\nhad only heard of her. It was, in fact, the cause of my throwing myself\r\nin Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s way, and entering his service. Miss Wilfer has never\r\nknown this until now. I mention it now, only as a corroboration (though\r\nI hope it may be needless) of my being free from the sordid design\r\nattributed to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, this is a very artful dog,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with a deep look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a longer-headed schemer than I thought him. See how patiently\r\nand methodically he goes to work. He gets to know about me and my\r\nproperty, and about this young lady, and her share in poor young John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstory, and he puts this and that together, and he says to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget in with Boffin, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get in with this young lady, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll work\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em both at the same time, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring my pigs to market somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I hear him say it, bless you! I look at him, now, and I see him say it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin pointed at the culprit, as it were in the act, and hugged\r\nhimself in his great penetration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But luckily he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t to deal with the people he supposed, Bella, my\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98No! Luckily he had to deal with you, and with\r\nme, and with Daniel and Miss Dancer, and with Elwes, and with Vulture\r\nHopkins, and with Blewbury Jones and all the rest of us, one down\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other come on. And he\xe2\x80\x99s beat; that\xe2\x80\x99s what he is; regularly beat. He\r\nthought to squeeze money out of us, and he has done for himself instead,\r\nBella my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella my dear made no response, gave no sign of acquiescence. When she\r\nhad first covered her face she had sunk upon a chair with her hands\r\nresting on the back of it, and had never moved since. There was a short\r\nsilence at this point, and Mrs Boffin softly rose as if to go to her.\r\nBut, Mr Boffin stopped her with a gesture, and she obediently sat down\r\nagain and stayed where she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s your pay, Mister Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Golden Dustman,\r\njerking the folded scrap of paper he had in his hand, towards his late\r\nSecretary. \xe2\x80\x98I dare say you can stoop to pick it up, after what you have\r\nstooped to here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have stooped to nothing but this,\xe2\x80\x99 Rokesmith answered as he took it\r\nfrom the ground; \xe2\x80\x98and this is mine, for I have earned it by the hardest\r\nof hard labour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty quick packer, I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98because the\r\nsooner you are gone, bag and baggage, the better for all parties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need have no fear of my lingering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s just one thing though,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that I should like to\r\nask you before we come to a good riddance, if it was only to show this\r\nyoung lady how conceited you schemers are, in thinking that nobody finds\r\nout how you contradict yourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask me anything you wish to ask,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Rokesmith, \xe2\x80\x98but use the\r\nexpedition that you recommend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You pretend to have a mighty admiration for this young lady?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nBoffin, laying his hand protectingly on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s head without looking\r\ndown at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not pretend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Well. You HAVE a mighty admiration for this young lady--since you\r\nare so particular?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you reconcile that, with this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s being a\r\nweak-spirited, improvident idiot, not knowing what was due to herself,\r\nflinging up her money to the church-weathercocks, and racing off at a\r\nsplitting pace for the workhouse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Or won\xe2\x80\x99t you? What else could you have made this young lady\r\nout to be, if she had listened to such addresses as yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What else, if I had been so happy as to win her affections and possess\r\nher heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Win her affections,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Boffin, with ineffable contempt,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and possess her heart! Mew says the cat, Quack-quack says the duck,\r\nBow-wow-wow says the dog! Win her affections and possess her heart! Mew,\r\nQuack-quack, Bow-wow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn Rokesmith stared at him in his outburst, as if with some faint idea\r\nthat he had gone mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is due to this young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98is Money, and this\r\nyoung lady right well knows it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You slander the young lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU slander the young lady; you with your affections and hearts and\r\ntrumpery,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s of a piece with the rest of your\r\nbehaviour. I heard of these doings of yours only last night, or you\r\nshould have heard of \xe2\x80\x98em from me, sooner, take your oath of it. I heard\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98em from a lady with as good a headpiece as the best, and she knows\r\nthis young lady, and I know this young lady, and we all three know that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s Money she makes a stand for--money, money, money--and that you and\r\nyour affections and hearts are a Lie, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, quietly turning to her, \xe2\x80\x98for your delicate\r\nand unvarying kindness I thank you with the warmest gratitude. Good-bye!\r\nMiss Wilfer, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, laying his hand on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x98you may begin to make yourself quite comfortable, and I hope you\r\nfeel that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been righted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, Bella was so far from appearing to feel it, that she shrank from\r\nhis hand and from the chair, and, starting up in an incoherent passion\r\nof tears, and stretching out her arms, cried, \xe2\x80\x98O Mr Rokesmith, before\r\nyou go, if you could but make me poor again! O! Make me poor again,\r\nSomebody, I beg and pray, or my heart will break if this goes on! Pa,\r\ndear, make me poor again and take me home! I was bad enough there, but\r\nI have been so much worse here. Don\xe2\x80\x99t give me money, Mr Boffin, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave money. Keep it away from me, and only let me speak to good little\r\nPa, and lay my head upon his shoulder, and tell him all my griefs.\r\nNobody else can understand me, nobody else can comfort me, nobody else\r\nknows how unworthy I am, and yet can love me like a little child. I am\r\nbetter with Pa than any one--more innocent, more sorry, more glad!\xe2\x80\x99 So,\r\ncrying out in a wild way that she could not bear this, Bella drooped her\r\nhead on Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s ready breast.\r\n\r\nJohn Rokesmith from his place in the room, and Mr Boffin from his,\r\nlooked on at her in silence until she was silent herself. Then Mr Boffin\r\nobserved in a soothing and comfortable tone, \xe2\x80\x98There, my dear, there; you\r\nare righted now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ALL right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, at your\r\nbeing a little flurried by having a scene with this fellow, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover, my dear, and you\xe2\x80\x99re righted, and it\xe2\x80\x99s--and it\xe2\x80\x99s ALL right!\xe2\x80\x99 Which\r\nMr Boffin repeated with a highly satisfied air of completeness and\r\nfinality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hate you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, turning suddenly upon him, with a stamp of\r\nher little foot--\xe2\x80\x98at least, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hate you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98HUL--LO!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr Boffin in an amazed under-tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a scolding, unjust, abusive, aggravating, bad old creature!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I am angry with my ungrateful self for calling you names;\r\nbut you are, you are; you know you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin stared here, and stared there, as misdoubting that he must be\r\nin some sort of fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard you with shame,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98With shame for myself, and\r\nwith shame for you. You ought to be above the base tale-bearing of a\r\ntime-serving woman; but you are above nothing now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, seeming to become convinced that this was a fit, rolled his\r\neyes and loosened his neckcloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I came here, I respected you and honoured you, and I soon loved\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella. \xe2\x80\x98And now I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the sight of you. At least, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know that I ought to go so far as that--only you\xe2\x80\x99re a--you\xe2\x80\x99re a\r\nMonster!\xe2\x80\x99 Having shot this bolt out with a great expenditure of force,\r\nBella hysterically laughed and cried together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best wish I can wish you is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, returning to the charge,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that you had not one single farthing in the world. If any true friend\r\nand well-wisher could make you a bankrupt, you would be a Duck; but as a\r\nman of property you are a Demon!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter despatching this second bolt with a still greater expenditure of\r\nforce, Bella laughed and cried still more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith, pray stay one moment. Pray hear one word from me before\r\nyou go! I am deeply sorry for the reproaches you have borne on my\r\naccount. Out of the depths of my heart I earnestly and truly beg your\r\npardon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she stepped towards him, he met her. As she gave him her hand, he put\r\nit to his lips, and said, \xe2\x80\x98God bless you!\xe2\x80\x99 No laughing was mixed with\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s crying then; her tears were pure and fervent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is not an ungenerous word that I have heard addressed to\r\nyou--heard with scorn and indignation, Mr Rokesmith--but it has wounded\r\nme far more than you, for I have deserved it, and you never have. Mr\r\nRokesmith, it is to me you owe this perverted account of what passed\r\nbetween us that night. I parted with the secret, even while I was angry\r\nwith myself for doing so. It was very bad in me, but indeed it was not\r\nwicked. I did it in a moment of conceit and folly--one of my many such\r\nmoments--one of my many such hours--years. As I am punished for it\r\nseverely, try to forgive it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do with all my soul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. O thank you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t part from me till I have said one other\r\nword, to do you justice. The only fault you can be truly charged with,\r\nin having spoken to me as you did that night--with how much delicacy\r\nand how much forbearance no one but I can know or be grateful to you\r\nfor--is, that you laid yourself open to be slighted by a worldly shallow\r\ngirl whose head was turned, and who was quite unable to rise to the\r\nworth of what you offered her. Mr Rokesmith, that girl has often seen\r\nherself in a pitiful and poor light since, but never in so pitiful\r\nand poor a light as now, when the mean tone in which she answered\r\nyou--sordid and vain girl that she was--has been echoed in her ears by\r\nMr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe kissed her hand again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s speeches were detestable to me, shocking to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella, startling that gentleman with another stamp of her little\r\nfoot. \xe2\x80\x98It is quite true that there was a time, and very lately, when I\r\ndeserved to be so \xe2\x80\x9crighted,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Rokesmith; but I hope that I shall never\r\ndeserve it again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe once more put her hand to his lips, and then relinquished it, and\r\nleft the room. Bella was hurrying back to the chair in which she had\r\nhidden her face so long, when, catching sight of Mrs Boffin by the\r\nway, she stopped at her. \xe2\x80\x98He is gone,\xe2\x80\x99 sobbed Bella indignantly,\r\ndespairingly, in fifty ways at once, with her arms round Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck. \xe2\x80\x98He has been most shamefully abused, and most unjustly and most\r\nbasely driven away, and I am the cause of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll this time, Mr Boffin had been rolling his eyes over his loosened\r\nneckerchief, as if his fit were still upon him. Appearing now to think\r\nthat he was coming to, he stared straight before him for a while, tied\r\nhis neckerchief again, took several long inspirations, swallowed several\r\ntimes, and ultimately exclaimed with a deep sigh, as if he felt himself\r\non the whole better: \xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo word, good or bad, did Mrs Boffin say; but she tenderly took care of\r\nBella, and glanced at her husband as if for orders. Mr Boffin, without\r\nimparting any, took his seat on a chair over against them, and there\r\nsat leaning forward, with a fixed countenance, his legs apart, a hand on\r\neach knee, and his elbows squared, until Bella should dry her eyes and\r\nraise her head, which in the fulness of time she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, rising hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x98I am very grateful to\r\nyou for all you have done for me, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling girl!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t indeed.--Ugh! you vicious\r\nold thing!\xe2\x80\x99 (This to Mr Boffin.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be rash, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Think well of what you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you had better think well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall never more think well of YOU,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, cutting him\r\nshort, with intense defiance in her expressive little eyebrows, and\r\nchampionship of the late Secretary in every dimple. \xe2\x80\x98No! Never again!\r\nYour money has changed you to marble. You are a hard-hearted Miser. You\r\nare worse than Dancer, worse than Hopkins, worse than Blackberry Jones,\r\nworse than any of the wretches. And more!\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Bella, breaking\r\ninto tears again, \xe2\x80\x98you were wholly undeserving of the Gentleman you have\r\nlost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, Miss Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 the Golden Dustman slowly\r\nremonstrated, \xe2\x80\x98that you set up Rokesmith against me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98He is worth a Million of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery pretty she looked, though very angry, as she made herself as\r\ntall as she possibly could (which was not extremely tall), and utterly\r\nrenounced her patron with a lofty toss of her rich brown head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather he thought well of me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98though he swept the\r\nstreet for bread, than that you did, though you splashed the mud upon\r\nhim from the wheels of a chariot of pure gold.--There!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well I\xe2\x80\x99m sure!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And for a long time past, when you have thought you set yourself above\r\nhim, I have only seen you under his feet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella--\xe2\x80\x98There! And\r\nthroughout I saw in him the master, and I saw in you the man--There! And\r\nwhen you used him shamefully, I took his part and loved him--There! I\r\nboast of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter which strong avowal Bella underwent reaction, and cried to any\r\nextent, with her face on the back of her chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, as soon as he could find an opening\r\nfor breaking the silence and striking in. \xe2\x80\x98Give me your attention,\r\nBella. I am not angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I AM!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed the Golden Dustman, \xe2\x80\x98I am not angry, and I mean kindly\r\nto you, and I want to overlook this. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay where you are, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to say no more about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, rising hurriedly again; \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of staying here. I must go home for good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin reasoned. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t do what you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nundo; don\xe2\x80\x99t do what you\xe2\x80\x99re sure to be sorry for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall never be sorry for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98and I should always be\r\nsorry, and should every minute of my life despise myself if I remained\r\nhere after what has happened.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 argued Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98let there be no mistake about it.\r\nLook before you leap, you know. Stay where you are, and all\xe2\x80\x99s well, and\r\nall\xe2\x80\x99s as it was to be. Go away, and you can never come back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know that I can never come back, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t expect,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin pursued, \xe2\x80\x98that I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to settle\r\nmoney on you, if you leave us like this, because I am not. No, Bella! Be\r\ncareful! Not one brass farthing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Expect!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, haughtily. \xe2\x80\x98Do you think that any power on earth\r\ncould make me take it, if you did, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut there was Mrs Boffin to part from, and, in the full flush of her\r\ndignity, the impressible little soul collapsed again. Down upon her\r\nknees before that good woman, she rocked herself upon her breast, and\r\ncried, and sobbed, and folded her in her arms with all her might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a dear, a dear, the best of dears!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re the\r\nbest of human creatures. I can never be thankful enough to you, and I\r\ncan never forget you. If I should live to be blind and deaf I know I\r\nshall see and hear you, in my fancy, to the last of my dim old days!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin wept most heartily, and embraced her with all fondness; but\r\nsaid not one single word except that she was her dear girl. She said\r\nthat often enough, to be sure, for she said it over and over again; but\r\nnot one word else.\r\n\r\nBella broke from her at length, and was going weeping out of the room,\r\nwhen in her own little queer affectionate way, she half relented towards\r\nMr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad,\xe2\x80\x99 sobbed Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that I called you names, sir, because\r\nyou richly deserved it. But I am very sorry that I called you names,\r\nbecause you used to be so different. Say good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I knew which of your hands was the least spoilt, I would ask you\r\nto let me touch it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98for the last time. But not because I\r\nrepent of what I have said to you. For I don\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try the left hand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, holding it out in a stolid manner;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s the least used.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been wonderfully good and kind to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98and I kiss\r\nit for that. You have been as bad as bad could be to Mr Rokesmith, and I\r\nthrow it away for that. Thank you for myself, and good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin as before.\r\n\r\nBella caught him round the neck and kissed him, and ran out for ever.\r\n\r\nShe ran up-stairs, and sat down on the floor in her own room, and cried\r\nabundantly. But the day was declining and she had no time to lose. She\r\nopened all the places where she kept her dresses; selected only those\r\nshe had brought with her, leaving all the rest; and made a great\r\nmisshapen bundle of them, to be sent for afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t take one of the others,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, tying the knots of the\r\nbundle very tight, in the severity of her resolution. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave all\r\nthe presents behind, and begin again entirely on my own account.\xe2\x80\x99 That\r\nthe resolution might be thoroughly carried into practice, she even\r\nchanged the dress she wore, for that in which she had come to the grand\r\nmansion. Even the bonnet she put on, was the bonnet that had mounted\r\ninto the Boffin chariot at Holloway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I am complete,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a little trying, but I have\r\nsteeped my eyes in cold water, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t cry any more. You have been\r\na pleasant room to me, dear room. Adieu! We shall never see each other\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a parting kiss of her fingers to it, she softly closed the door and\r\nwent with a light foot down the great staircase, pausing and listening\r\nas she went, that she might meet none of the household. No one chanced\r\nto be about, and she got down to the hall in quiet. The door of the late\r\nSecretary\xe2\x80\x99s room stood open. She peeped in as she passed, and divined\r\nfrom the emptiness of his table, and the general appearance of things,\r\nthat he was already gone. Softly opening the great hall door, and\r\nsoftly closing it upon herself, she turned and kissed it on the\r\noutside--insensible old combination of wood and iron that it\r\nwas!--before she ran away from the house at a swift pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was well done!\xe2\x80\x99 panted Bella, slackening in the next street, and\r\nsubsiding into a walk. \xe2\x80\x98If I had left myself any breath to cry with, I\r\nshould have cried again. Now poor dear darling little Pa, you are going\r\nto see your lovely woman unexpectedly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nTHE FEAST OF THE THREE HOBGOBLINS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City looked unpromising enough, as Bella made her way along its\r\ngritty streets. Most of its money-mills were slackening sail, or had\r\nleft off grinding for the day. The master-millers had already departed,\r\nand the journeymen were departing. There was a jaded aspect on\r\nthe business lanes and courts, and the very pavements had a weary\r\nappearance, confused by the tread of a million of feet. There must be\r\nhours of night to temper down the day\xe2\x80\x99s distraction of so feverish a\r\nplace. As yet the worry of the newly-stopped whirling and grinding on\r\nthe part of the money-mills seemed to linger in the air, and the quiet\r\nwas more like the prostration of a spent giant than the repose of one\r\nwho was renewing his strength.\r\n\r\nIf Bella thought, as she glanced at the mighty Bank, how agreeable it\r\nwould be to have an hour\xe2\x80\x99s gardening there, with a bright copper shovel,\r\namong the money, still she was not in an avaricious vein. Much improved\r\nin that respect, and with certain half-formed images which had little\r\ngold in their composition, dancing before her bright eyes, she arrived\r\nin the drug-flavoured region of Mincing Lane, with the sensation of\r\nhaving just opened a drawer in a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\nThe counting-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles was pointed out\r\nby an elderly female accustomed to the care of offices, who dropped upon\r\nBella out of a public-house, wiping her mouth, and accounted for its\r\nhumidity on natural principles well known to the physical sciences, by\r\nexplaining that she had looked in at the door to see what o\xe2\x80\x99clock it\r\nwas. The counting-house was a wall-eyed ground floor by a dark gateway,\r\nand Bella was considering, as she approached it, could there be any\r\nprecedent in the City for her going in and asking for R. Wilfer, when\r\nwhom should she see, sitting at one of the windows with the plate-glass\r\nsash raised, but R. Wilfer himself, preparing to take a slight\r\nrefection.\r\n\r\nOn approaching nearer, Bella discerned that the refection had\r\nthe appearance of a small cottage-loaf and a pennyworth of milk.\r\nSimultaneously with this discovery on her part, her father discovered\r\nher, and invoked the echoes of Mincing Lane to exclaim \xe2\x80\x98My gracious me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe then came cherubically flying out without a hat, and embraced her,\r\nand handed her in. \xe2\x80\x98For it\xe2\x80\x99s after hours and I am all alone, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe explained, \xe2\x80\x98and am having--as I sometimes do when they are all\r\ngone--a quiet tea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking round the office, as if her father were a captive and this his\r\ncell, Bella hugged him and choked him to her heart\xe2\x80\x99s content.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never was so surprised, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said her father. \xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve my eyes. Upon my life, I thought they had taken to lying! The\r\nidea of your coming down the Lane yourself! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you send the\r\nfootman down the Lane, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have brought no footman with me, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh indeed! But you have brought the elegant turn-out, my love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You never can have walked, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked so very much astonished, that Bella could not make up her mind\r\nto break it to him just yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The consequence is, Pa, that your lovely woman feels a little faint,\r\nand would very much like to share your tea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cottage loaf and the pennyworth of milk had been set forth on a\r\nsheet of paper on the window-seat. The cherubic pocket-knife, with the\r\nfirst bit of the loaf still on its point, lay beside them where it had\r\nbeen hastily thrown down. Bella took the bit off, and put it in her\r\nmouth. \xe2\x80\x98My dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, \xe2\x80\x98the idea of your partaking of\r\nsuch lowly fare! But at least you must have your own loaf and your own\r\npenn\xe2\x80\x99orth. One moment, my dear. The Dairy is just over the way and round\r\nthe corner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRegardless of Bella\xe2\x80\x99s dissuasions he ran out, and quickly returned with\r\nthe new supply. \xe2\x80\x98My dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, as he spread it on another\r\npiece of paper before her, \xe2\x80\x98the idea of a splendid--!\xe2\x80\x99 and then looked\r\nat her figure, and stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--of a splendid female,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed more slowly, \xe2\x80\x98putting up with\r\nsuch accommodation as the present!--Is that a new dress you have on, my\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa, an old one. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I THOUGHT I remembered it, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should, for you bought it, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I THOUGHT I bought it my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub, giving himself a\r\nlittle shake, as if to rouse his faculties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And have you grown so fickle that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like your own taste, Pa\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, swallowing a bit of the cottage loaf with\r\nconsiderable effort, for it seemed to stick by the way: \xe2\x80\x98I should have\r\nthought it was hardly sufficiently splendid for existing circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, moving coaxingly to his side instead of\r\nremaining opposite, \xe2\x80\x98you sometimes have a quiet tea here all alone? I\r\nam not in the tea\xe2\x80\x99s way, if I draw my arm over your shoulder like this,\r\nPa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear, and no, my dear. Yes to the first question, and Certainly\r\nNot to the second. Respecting the quiet tea, my dear, why you see the\r\noccupations of the day are sometimes a little wearing; and if there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing interposed between the day and your mother, why SHE is sometimes\r\na little wearing, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear. So sometimes I put a quiet tea at the window here, with\r\na little quiet contemplation of the Lane (which comes soothing), between\r\nthe day, and domestic--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bliss,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And domestic Bliss,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, quite contented to accept the\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\nBella kissed him. \xe2\x80\x98And it is in this dark dingy place of captivity,\r\npoor dear, that you pass all the hours of your life when you are not at\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at home, or not on the road there, or on the road here, my love.\r\nYes. You see that little desk in the corner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the dark corner, furthest both from the light and from the\r\nfireplace? The shabbiest desk of all the desks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, does it really strike you in that point of view, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nher father, surveying it artistically with his head on one side: \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmine. That\xe2\x80\x99s called Rumty\xe2\x80\x99s Perch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whose Perch?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella with great indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rumty\xe2\x80\x99s. You see, being rather high and up two steps they call it a\r\nPerch. And they call ME Rumty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dare they!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re playful, Bella my dear; they\xe2\x80\x99re playful. They\xe2\x80\x99re more or less\r\nyounger than I am, and they\xe2\x80\x99re playful. What does it matter? It might\r\nbe Surly, or Sulky, or fifty disagreeable things that I really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike to be considered. But Rumty! Lor, why not Rumty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo inflict a heavy disappointment on this sweet nature, which had been,\r\nthrough all her caprices, the object of her recognition, love, and\r\nadmiration from infancy, Bella felt to be the hardest task of her hard\r\nday. \xe2\x80\x98I should have done better,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98to tell him at first;\r\nI should have done better to tell him just now, when he had some slight\r\nmisgiving; he is quite happy again, and I shall make him wretched.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was falling back on his loaf and milk, with the pleasantest\r\ncomposure, and Bella stealing her arm a little closer about him, and at\r\nthe same time sticking up his hair with an irresistible propensity\r\nto play with him founded on the habit of her whole life, had prepared\r\nherself to say: \xe2\x80\x98Pa dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t be cast down, but I must tell you\r\nsomething disagreeable!\xe2\x80\x99 when he interrupted her in an unlooked-for\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My gracious me!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed, invoking the Mincing Lane echoes as\r\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x98This is very extraordinary!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Rokesmith now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Pa, no,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, greatly flurried. \xe2\x80\x98Surely not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes there is! Look here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSooth to say, Mr Rokesmith not only passed the window, but came into the\r\ncounting-house. And not only came into the counting-house, but, finding\r\nhimself alone there with Bella and her father, rushed at Bella and\r\ncaught her in his arms, with the rapturous words \xe2\x80\x98My dear, dear girl; my\r\ngallant, generous, disinterested, courageous, noble girl!\xe2\x80\x99 And not only\r\nthat even, (which one might have thought astonishment enough for one\r\ndose), but Bella, after hanging her head for a moment, lifted it up and\r\nlaid it on his breast, as if that were her head\xe2\x80\x99s chosen and lasting\r\nresting-place!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew you would come to him, and I followed you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith. \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nlove, my life! You ARE mine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which Bella responded, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I AM yours if you think me worth\r\ntaking!\xe2\x80\x99 And after that, seemed to shrink to next to nothing in the\r\nclasp of his arms, partly because it was such a strong one on his part,\r\nand partly because there was such a yielding to it on hers.\r\n\r\nThe cherub, whose hair would have done for itself under the influence of\r\nthis amazing spectacle, what Bella had just now done for it, staggered\r\nback into the window-seat from which he had risen, and surveyed the pair\r\nwith his eyes dilated to their utmost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we must think of dear Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told dear Pa; let\r\nus speak to Pa.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon which they turned to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish first, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the cherub faintly, \xe2\x80\x98that you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nthe kindness to sprinkle me with a little milk, for I feel as if I\r\nwas--Going.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn fact, the good little fellow had become alarmingly limp, and his\r\nsenses seemed to be rapidly escaping, from the knees upward. Bella\r\nsprinkled him with kisses instead of milk, but gave him a little of that\r\narticle to drink; and he gradually revived under her caressing care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll break it to you gently, dearest Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the cherub, looking at them both, \xe2\x80\x98you broke so much\r\nin the first--Gush, if I may so express myself--that I think I am equal\r\nto a good large breakage now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wilfer,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Rokesmith, excitedly and joyfully, \xe2\x80\x98Bella takes\r\nme, though I have no fortune, even no present occupation; nothing but\r\nwhat I can get in the life before us. Bella takes me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I should rather have inferred, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the cherub\r\nfeebly, \xe2\x80\x98that Bella took you, from what I have within these few minutes\r\nremarked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98how ill I have used him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, \xe2\x80\x98what a heart she has!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98what a shocking creature I was\r\ngrowing, when he saved me from myself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith, \xe2\x80\x98what a sacrifice she has made\r\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cherub, still pathetically scared, \xe2\x80\x98and my\r\ndear John Rokesmith, if you will allow me so to call you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes do, Pa, do!\xe2\x80\x99 urged Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I allow you, and my will is his law.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it--dear John Rokesmith?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an engaging shyness in Bella, coupled with an engaging\r\ntenderness of love and confidence and pride, in thus first calling him\r\nby name, which made it quite excusable in John Rokesmith to do what he\r\ndid. What he did was, once more to give her the appearance of vanishing\r\nas aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, my dears,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the cherub, \xe2\x80\x98that if you could make it\r\nconvenient to sit one on one side of me, and the other on the other, we\r\nshould get on rather more consecutively, and make things rather\r\nplainer. John Rokesmith mentioned, a while ago, that he had no present\r\noccupation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa, none,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From which I argue,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded the cherub, \xe2\x80\x98that he has left Mr\r\nBoffin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Pa. And so--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop a bit, my dear. I wish to lead up to it by degrees. And that Mr\r\nBoffin has not treated him well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has treated him most shamefully, dear Pa!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella with a flashing\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of which,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the cherub, enjoining patience with his hand, \xe2\x80\x98a\r\ncertain mercenary young person distantly related to myself, could not\r\napprove? Am I leading up to it right?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could not approve, sweet Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with a tearful laugh and a\r\njoyful kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon which,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the cherub, \xe2\x80\x98the certain mercenary young person\r\ndistantly related to myself, having previously observed and mentioned\r\nto myself that prosperity was spoiling Mr Boffin, felt that she must not\r\nsell her sense of what was right and what was wrong, and what was true\r\nand what was false, and what was just and what was unjust, for any\r\nprice that could be paid to her by any one alive? Am I leading up to it\r\nright?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith another tearful laugh Bella joyfully kissed him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And therefore--and therefore,\xe2\x80\x99 the cherub went on in a glowing voice,\r\nas Bella\xe2\x80\x99s hand stole gradually up his waistcoat to his neck, \xe2\x80\x98this\r\nmercenary young person distantly related to myself, refused the\r\nprice, took off the splendid fashions that were part of it, put on the\r\ncomparatively poor dress that I had last given her, and trusting to my\r\nsupporting her in what was right, came straight to me. Have I led up to\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s hand was round his neck by this time, and her face was on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The mercenary young person distantly related to myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said her\r\ngood father, \xe2\x80\x98did well! The mercenary young person distantly related\r\nto myself, did not trust to me in vain! I admire this mercenary young\r\nperson distantly related to myself, more in this dress than if she had\r\ncome to me in China silks, Cashmere shawls, and Golconda diamonds. I\r\nlove this young person dearly. I say to the man of this young person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart, out of my heart and with all of it, \xe2\x80\x9cMy blessing on this\r\nengagement betwixt you, and she brings you a good fortune when she\r\nbrings you the poverty she has accepted for your sake and the honest\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stanch little man\xe2\x80\x99s voice failed him as he gave John Rokesmith his\r\nhand, and he was silent, bending his face low over his daughter. But,\r\nnot for long. He soon looked up, saying in a sprightly tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, my dear child, if you think you can entertain John Rokesmith\r\nfor a minute and a half, I\xe2\x80\x99ll run over to the Dairy, and fetch HIM a\r\ncottage loaf and a drink of milk, that we may all have tea together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was, as Bella gaily said, like the supper provided for the three\r\nnursery hobgoblins at their house in the forest, without their\r\nthunderous low growlings of the alarming discovery, \xe2\x80\x98Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\ndrinking MY milk!\xe2\x80\x99 It was a delicious repast; by far the most delicious\r\nthat Bella, or John Rokesmith, or even R. Wilfer had ever made. The\r\nuncongenial oddity of its surroundings, with the two brass knobs of the\r\niron safe of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles staring from a corner,\r\nlike the eyes of some dull dragon, only made it the more delightful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To think,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub, looking round the office with unspeakable\r\nenjoyment, \xe2\x80\x98that anything of a tender nature should come off here, is\r\nwhat tickles me. To think that ever I should have seen my Bella folded\r\nin the arms of her future husband, HERE, you know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not until the cottage loaves and the milk had for some time\r\ndisappeared, and the foreshadowings of night were creeping over Mincing\r\nLane, that the cherub by degrees became a little nervous, and said to\r\nBella, as he cleared his throat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!--Have you thought at all about your mother, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your sister Lavvy, for instance, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Pa. I think we had better not enter into particulars at home. I\r\nthink it will be quite enough to say that I had a difference with Mr\r\nBoffin, and have left for good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John Rokesmith being acquainted with your Ma, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said her\r\nfather, after some slight hesitation, \xe2\x80\x98I need have no delicacy in\r\nhinting before him that you may perhaps find your Ma a little wearing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little, patient Pa?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella with a tuneful laugh: the tune fuller\r\nfor being so loving in its tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! We\xe2\x80\x99ll say, strictly in confidence among ourselves, wearing;\r\nwe won\xe2\x80\x99t qualify it,\xe2\x80\x99 the cherub stoutly admitted. \xe2\x80\x98And your sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemper is wearing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you must prepare yourself you know, my precious,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father,\r\nwith much gentleness, \xe2\x80\x98for our looking very poor and meagre at home, and\r\nbeing at the best but very uncomfortable, after Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, Pa. I could bear much harder trials--for John.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe closing words were not so softly and blushingly said but that John\r\nheard them, and showed that he heard them by again assisting Bella to\r\nanother of those mysterious disappearances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub gaily, and not expressing disapproval, \xe2\x80\x98when\r\nyou--when you come back from retirement, my love, and reappear on the\r\nsurface, I think it will be time to lock up and go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf the counting-house of Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles had ever been\r\nshut up by three happier people, glad as most people were to shut it up,\r\nthey must have been superlatively happy indeed. But first Bella mounted\r\nupon Rumty\xe2\x80\x99s Perch, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Show me what you do here all day long,\r\ndear Pa. Do you write like this?\xe2\x80\x99 laying her round cheek upon her plump\r\nleft arm, and losing sight of her pen in waves of hair, in a highly\r\nunbusiness-like manner. Though John Rokesmith seemed to like it.\r\n\r\nSo, the three hobgoblins, having effaced all traces of their feast, and\r\nswept up the crumbs, came out of Mincing Lane to walk to Holloway; and\r\nif two of the hobgoblins didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish the distance twice as long as it\r\nwas, the third hobgoblin was much mistaken. Indeed, that modest spirit\r\ndeemed himself so much in the way of their deep enjoyment of the\r\njourney, that he apologetically remarked: \xe2\x80\x98I think, my dears, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nthe lead on the other side of the road, and seem not to belong to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhich he did, cherubically strewing the path with smiles, in the absence\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\nIt was almost ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when they stopped within view of Wilfer\r\nCastle; and then, the spot being quiet and deserted, Bella began a\r\nseries of disappearances which threatened to last all night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, John,\xe2\x80\x99 the cherub hinted at last, \xe2\x80\x98that if you can spare me\r\nthe young person distantly related to myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t spare her,\xe2\x80\x99 answered John, \xe2\x80\x98but I must lend her to you.--My\r\nDarling!\xe2\x80\x99 A word of magic which caused Bella instantly to disappear\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, dearest Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, when she became visible, \xe2\x80\x98put your hand\r\nin mine, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll run home as fast as ever we can run, and get it over.\r\nNow, Pa. Once!--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 the cherub faltered, with something of a craven air, \xe2\x80\x98I was\r\ngoing to observe that if your mother--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t hang back, sir, to gain time,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, putting out her\r\nright foot; \xe2\x80\x98do you see that, sir? That\xe2\x80\x99s the mark; come up to the mark,\r\nsir. Once! Twice! Three times and away, Pa!\xe2\x80\x99 Off she skimmed, bearing\r\nthe cherub along, nor ever stopped, nor suffered him to stop, until she\r\nhad pulled at the bell. \xe2\x80\x98Now, dear Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, taking him by both\r\nears as if he were a pitcher, and conveying his face to her rosy lips,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98we are in for it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Lavvy came out to open the gate, waited on by that attentive\r\ncavalier and friend of the family, Mr George Sampson. \xe2\x80\x98Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nBella!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Lavvy starting back at the sight. And then\r\nbawled, \xe2\x80\x98Ma! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Bella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis produced, before they could get into the house, Mrs Wilfer. Who,\r\nstanding in the portal, received them with ghostly gloom, and all her\r\nother appliances of ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My child is welcome, though unlooked for,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, at the time\r\npresenting her cheek as if it were a cool slate for visitors to enrol\r\nthemselves upon. \xe2\x80\x98You too, R. W., are welcome, though late. Does the\r\nmale domestic of Mrs Boffin hear me there?\xe2\x80\x99 This deep-toned inquiry was\r\ncast forth into the night, for response from the menial in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no one waiting, Ma, dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no one waiting?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Wilfer in majestic accents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Ma, dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA dignified shiver pervaded Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and gloves, as\r\nwho should say, \xe2\x80\x98An Enigma!\xe2\x80\x99 and then she marched at the head of the\r\nprocession to the family keeping-room, where she observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unless, R. W.\xe2\x80\x99: who started on being solemnly turned upon: \xe2\x80\x98you have\r\ntaken the precaution of making some addition to our frugal supper on\r\nyour way home, it will prove but a distasteful one to Bella. Cold neck\r\nof mutton and a lettuce can ill compete with the luxuries of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that, Ma dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s board is\r\nnothing to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, here Miss Lavinia, who had been intently eyeing Bella\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet,\r\nstruck in with \xe2\x80\x98Why, Bella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Lavvy, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Irrepressible lowered her eyes to Bella\xe2\x80\x99s dress, and stooped to look\r\nat it, exclaiming again: \xe2\x80\x98Why, Bella!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Lavvy, I know what I have got on. I was going to tell Ma when you\r\ninterrupted. I have left Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house for good, Ma, and I have come\r\nhome again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer spake no word, but, having glared at her offspring for a\r\nminute or two in an awful silence, retired into her corner of state\r\nbackward, and sat down: like a frozen article on sale in a Russian\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short, dear Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, taking off the depreciated bonnet and\r\nshaking out her hair, \xe2\x80\x98I have had a very serious difference with Mr\r\nBoffin on the subject of his treatment of a member of his household, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a final difference, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I am bound to tell you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 added R. W., submissively, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nBella has acted in a truly brave spirit, and with a truly right feeling.\r\nAnd therefore I hope, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99ll not allow yourself to be greatly\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Lavvy, in a sepulchral, warning voice, founded on\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s; \xe2\x80\x98George Sampson, speak! What did I tell you about those\r\nBoffins?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson perceiving his frail bark to be labouring among shoals and\r\nbreakers, thought it safest not to refer back to any particular thing\r\nthat he had been told, lest he should refer back to the wrong thing.\r\nWith admirable seamanship he got his bark into deep water by murmuring\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes! I told George Sampson, as George Sampson tells you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nLavvy, \xe2\x80\x98that those hateful Boffins would pick a quarrel with Bella, as\r\nsoon as her novelty had worn off. Have they done it, or have they not?\r\nWas I right, or was I wrong? And what do you say to us, Bella, of your\r\nBoffins now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lavvy and Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98I say of Mr and Mrs Boffin what I always\r\nhave said; and I always shall say of them what I always have said. But\r\nnothing will induce me to quarrel with any one to-night. I hope you\r\nare not sorry to see me, Ma dear,\xe2\x80\x99 kissing her; \xe2\x80\x98and I hope you are not\r\nsorry to see me, Lavvy,\xe2\x80\x99 kissing her too; \xe2\x80\x98and as I notice the lettuce\r\nMa mentioned, on the table, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the salad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella playfully setting herself about the task, Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s impressive\r\ncountenance followed her with glaring eyes, presenting a combination\r\nof the once popular sign of the Saracen\xe2\x80\x99s Head, with a piece of\r\nDutch clock-work, and suggesting to an imaginative mind that from the\r\ncomposition of the salad, her daughter might prudently omit the vinegar.\r\nBut no word issued from the majestic matron\xe2\x80\x99s lips. And this was more\r\nterrific to her husband (as perhaps she knew) than any flow of eloquence\r\nwith which she could have edified the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Ma dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella in due course, \xe2\x80\x98the salad\xe2\x80\x99s ready, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast supper-time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer rose, but remained speechless. \xe2\x80\x98George!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Lavinia\r\nin her voice of warning, \xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99s chair!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sampson flew to the excellent\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s back, and followed her up close chair in hand, as she stalked\r\nto the banquet. Arrived at the table, she took her rigid seat, after\r\nfavouring Mr Sampson with a glare for himself, which caused the young\r\ngentleman to retire to his place in much confusion.\r\n\r\nThe cherub not presuming to address so tremendous an object, transacted\r\nher supper through the agency of a third person, as \xe2\x80\x98Mutton to your Ma,\r\nBella, my dear\xe2\x80\x99; and \xe2\x80\x98Lavvy, I dare say your Ma would take some lettuce\r\nif you were to put it on her plate.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s manner of receiving\r\nthose viands was marked by petrified absence of mind; in which state,\r\nlikewise, she partook of them, occasionally laying down her knife and\r\nfork, as saying within her own spirit, \xe2\x80\x98What is this I am doing?\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nglaring at one or other of the party, as if in indignant search of\r\ninformation. A magnetic result of such glaring was, that the person\r\nglared at could not by any means successfully pretend to be ignorant of\r\nthe fact: so that a bystander, without beholding Mrs Wilfer at all, must\r\nhave known at whom she was glaring, by seeing her refracted from the\r\ncountenance of the beglared one.\r\n\r\nMiss Lavinia was extremely affable to Mr Sampson on this special\r\noccasion, and took the opportunity of informing her sister why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not worth troubling you about, Bella, when you were in a sphere\r\nso far removed from your family as to make it a matter in which you\r\ncould be expected to take very little interest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia with a\r\ntoss of her chin; \xe2\x80\x98but George Sampson is paying his addresses to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella was glad to hear it. Mr Sampson became thoughtfully red, and\r\nfelt called upon to encircle Miss Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s waist with his arm; but,\r\nencountering a large pin in the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s belt, scarified a finger,\r\nuttered a sharp exclamation, and attracted the lightning of Mrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George is getting on very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Lavinia which might not have\r\nbeen supposed at the moment--\xe2\x80\x98and I dare say we shall be married, one of\r\nthese days. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to mention it when you were with your Bof--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhere Miss Lavinia checked herself in a bounce, and added more placidly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98when you were with Mr and Mrs Boffin; but now I think it sisterly to\r\nname the circumstance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Lavvy dear. I congratulate you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Bella. The truth is, George and I did discuss whether\r\nI should tell you; but I said to George that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much\r\ninterested in so paltry an affair, and that it was far more likely you\r\nwould rather detach yourself from us altogether, than have him added to\r\nthe rest of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was a mistake, dear Lavvy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It turns out to be,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Lavinia; \xe2\x80\x98but circumstances have\r\nchanged, you know, my dear. George is in a new situation, and his\r\nprospects are very good indeed. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had the courage to tell\r\nyou so yesterday, when you would have thought his prospects poor, and\r\nnot worth notice; but I feel quite bold tonight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When did you begin to feel timid, Lavvy?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Bella, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that I ever felt timid, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the Irrepressible.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But perhaps I might have said, if I had not been restrained by delicacy\r\ntowards a sister\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, that I have for some time felt independent;\r\ntoo independent, my dear, to subject myself to have my intended match\r\n(you\xe2\x80\x99ll prick yourself again, George) looked down upon. It is not that I\r\ncould have blamed you for looking down upon it, when you were looking up\r\nto a rich and great match, Bella; it is only that I was independent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhether the Irrepressible felt slighted by Bella\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that she\r\nwould not quarrel, or whether her spitefulness was evoked by Bella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn to the sphere of Mr George Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s courtship, or whether it was\r\na necessary fillip to her spirits that she should come into collision\r\nwith somebody on the present occasion,--anyhow she made a dash at her\r\nstately parent now, with the greatest impetuosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t sit staring at me in that intensely aggravating manner!\r\nIf you see a black on my nose, tell me so; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, leave me\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you address Me in those words?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Do you presume?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about presuming, Ma, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake. A girl who is old\r\nenough to be engaged, is quite old enough to object to be stared at as\r\nif she was a Clock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Audacious one!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Your grandmamma, if so addressed by\r\none of her daughters, at any age, would have insisted on her retiring to\r\na dark apartment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My grandmamma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavvy, folding her arms and leaning back\r\nin her chair, \xe2\x80\x98wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sat staring people out of countenance, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She would!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy. \xe2\x80\x98And if my\r\ngrandmamma wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in her dotage when she took to insisting on people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nretiring to dark apartments, she ought to have been. A pretty exhibition\r\nmy grandmamma must have made of herself! I wonder whether she ever\r\ninsisted on people\xe2\x80\x99s retiring into the ball of St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s; and if she\r\ndid, how she got them there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence!\xe2\x80\x99 proclaimed Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98I command silence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not the slightest intention of being silent, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nLavinia coolly, \xe2\x80\x98but quite the contrary. I am not going to be eyed as if\r\nI had come from the Boffins, and sit silent under it. I am not going\r\nto have George Sampson eyed as if HE had come from the Boffins, and sit\r\nsilent under it. If Pa thinks proper to be eyed as if HE had come from\r\nthe Boffins also, well and good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t choose to. And I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLavinia\xe2\x80\x99s engineering having made this crooked opening at Bella, Mrs\r\nWilfer strode into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You rebellious spirit! You mutinous child! Tell me this, Lavinia. If\r\nin violation of your mother\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments, you had condescended to allow\r\nyourself to be patronized by the Boffins, and if you had come from those\r\nhalls of slavery--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s mere nonsense, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Wilfer, with sublime severity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halls of slavery, Ma, is mere stuff and nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the unmoved\r\nIrrepressible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, presumptuous child, if you had come from the neighbourhood of\r\nPortland Place, bending under the yoke of patronage and attended by its\r\ndomestics in glittering garb to visit me, do you think my deep-seated\r\nfeelings could have been expressed in looks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All I think about it, is,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavinia, \xe2\x80\x98that I should wish them\r\nexpressed to the right person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued her mother, \xe2\x80\x98if making light of my warnings that the\r\nface of Mrs Boffin alone was a face teeming with evil, you had clung to\r\nMrs Boffin instead of to me, and had after all come home rejected by Mrs\r\nBoffin, trampled under foot by Mrs Boffin, and cast out by Mrs Boffin,\r\ndo you think my feelings could have been expressed in looks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLavinia was about replying to her honoured parent that she might as well\r\nhave dispensed with her looks altogether then, when Bella rose and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night, dear Ma. I have had a tiring day, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99 This\r\nbroke up the agreeable party. Mr George Sampson shortly afterwards took\r\nhis leave, accompanied by Miss Lavinia with a candle as far as the hall,\r\nand without a candle as far as the garden gate; Mrs Wilfer, washing her\r\nhands of the Boffins, went to bed after the manner of Lady Macbeth; and\r\nR. W. was left alone among the dilapidations of the supper table, in a\r\nmelancholy attitude.\r\n\r\nBut, a light footstep roused him from his meditations, and it was\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s. Her pretty hair was hanging all about her, and she had tripped\r\ndown softly, brush in hand, and barefoot, to say good-night to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, you most unquestionably ARE a lovely woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub,\r\ntaking up a tress in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98when your lovely woman marries, you shall\r\nhave that piece if you like, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll make you a chain of it. Would\r\nyou prize that remembrance of the dear creature?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my precious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you shall have it if you\xe2\x80\x99re good, sir. I am very, very sorry,\r\ndearest Pa, to have brought home all this trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My pet,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her father, in the simplest good faith, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nyourself uneasy about that. It really is not worth mentioning, because\r\nthings at home would have taken pretty much the same turn any way. If\r\nyour mother and sister don\xe2\x80\x99t find one subject to get at times a little\r\nwearing on, they find another. We\xe2\x80\x99re never out of a wearing subject,\r\nmy dear, I assure you. I am afraid you find your old room with Lavvy,\r\ndreadfully inconvenient, Bella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No I don\xe2\x80\x99t, Pa; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I mind, do you think, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my child, you used to complain of it when it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a\r\ncontrast as it must be now. Upon my word, I can only answer, because you\r\nare so much improved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pa. Because I am so thankful and so happy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere she choked him until her long hair made him sneeze, and then she\r\nlaughed until she made him laugh, and then she choked him again that\r\nthey might not be overheard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98Your lovely woman was told her fortune\r\nto night on her way home. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be a large fortune, because if the\r\nlovely woman\xe2\x80\x99s Intended gets a certain appointment that he hopes to get\r\nsoon, she will marry on a hundred and fifty pounds a year. But that\xe2\x80\x99s at\r\nfirst, and even if it should never be more, the lovely woman will make\r\nit quite enough. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not all, sir. In the fortune there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncertain fair man--a little man, the fortune-teller said--who, it seems,\r\nwill always find himself near the lovely woman, and will always have\r\nkept, expressly for him, such a peaceful corner in the lovely woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle house as never was. Tell me the name of that man, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he a Knave in the pack of cards?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the cherub, with a\r\ntwinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, in high glee, choking him again. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s the Knave of\r\nWilfers! Dear Pa, the lovely woman means to look forward to this fortune\r\nthat has been told for her, so delightfully, and to cause it to make her\r\na much better lovely woman than she ever has been yet. What the little\r\nfair man is expected to do, sir, is to look forward to it also, by\r\nsaying to himself when he is in danger of being over-worried, \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nland at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see land at last!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a dear Knave of Wilfers!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Bella; then putting out her\r\nsmall white bare foot, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the mark, sir. Come to the mark. Put your\r\nboot against it. We keep to it together, mind! Now, sir, you may kiss\r\nthe lovely woman before she runs away, so thankful and so happy. O yes,\r\nfair little man, so thankful and so happy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nA SOCIAL CHORUS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmazement sits enthroned upon the countenances of Mr and Mrs Alfred\r\nLammle\xe2\x80\x99s circle of acquaintance, when the disposal of their first-class\r\nfurniture and effects (including a Billiard Table in capital letters),\r\n\xe2\x80\x98by auction, under a bill of sale,\xe2\x80\x99 is publicly announced on a waving\r\nhearthrug in Sackville Street. But, nobody is half so much amazed as\r\nHamilton Veneering, Esquire, M.P. for Pocket-Breaches, who instantly\r\nbegins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on\r\nhis soul\xe2\x80\x99s register, who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has\r\nin the world. Mrs Veneering, W.M.P. for Pocket-Breaches, like a faithful\r\nwife shares her husband\xe2\x80\x99s discovery and inexpressible astonishment.\r\nPerhaps the Veneerings twain may deem the last unutterable feeling\r\nparticularly due to their reputation, by reason that once upon a time\r\nsome of the longer heads in the City are whispered to have shaken\r\nthemselves, when Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s extensive dealings and great wealth were\r\nmentioned. But, it is certain that neither Mr nor Mrs Veneering can\r\nfind words to wonder in, and it becomes necessary that they give to the\r\noldest and dearest friends they have in the world, a wondering dinner.\r\n\r\nFor, it is by this time noticeable that, whatever befals, the Veneerings\r\nmust give a dinner upon it. Lady Tippins lives in a chronic state\r\nof invitation to dine with the Veneerings, and in a chronic state of\r\ninflammation arising from the dinners. Boots and Brewer go about in\r\ncabs, with no other intelligible business on earth than to beat up\r\npeople to come and dine with the Veneerings. Veneering pervades the\r\nlegislative lobbies, intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to\r\ndinner. Mrs Veneering dined with five-and-twenty bran-new faces over\r\nnight; calls upon them all to day; sends them every one a dinner-card\r\nto-morrow, for the week after next; before that dinner is digested,\r\ncalls upon their brothers and sisters, their sons and daughters, their\r\nnephews and nieces, their aunts and uncles and cousins, and invites\r\nthem all to dinner. And still, as at first, howsoever, the dining circle\r\nwidens, it is to be observed that all the diners are consistent in\r\nappearing to go to the Veneerings, not to dine with Mr and Mrs Veneering\r\n(which would seem to be the last thing in their minds), but to dine with\r\none another.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all,--who knows?--Veneering may find this dining, though\r\nexpensive, remunerative, in the sense that it makes champions.\r\nMr Podsnap, as a representative man, is not alone in caring very\r\nparticularly for his own dignity, if not for that of his acquaintances,\r\nand therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out\r\nhis Permit, lest, in their being lessened, he should be. The gold and\r\nsilver camels, and the ice-pails, and the rest of the Veneering table\r\ndecorations, make a brilliant show, and when I, Podsnap, casually remark\r\nelsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels,\r\nI find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are\r\nbroken-kneed camels, or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t display camels myself, I am above them: I am a more solid man; but\r\nthese camels have basked in the light of my countenance, and how dare\r\nyou, sir, insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable\r\ncamels?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe camels are polishing up in the Analytical\xe2\x80\x99s pantry for the dinner\r\nof wonderment on the occasion of the Lammles going to pieces, and Mr\r\nTwemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable\r\nyard in Duke Street, Saint James\xe2\x80\x99s, in consequence of having taken\r\ntwo advertised pills at about mid-day, on the faith of the printed\r\nrepresentation accompanying the box (price one and a penny halfpenny,\r\ngovernment stamp included), that the same \xe2\x80\x98will be found highly salutary\r\nas a precautionary measure in connection with the pleasures of the\r\ntable.\xe2\x80\x99 To whom, while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill\r\nsticking in his gullet, and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm\r\ngum languidly wandering within him a little lower down, a servant enters\r\nwith the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A lady!\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, pluming his ruffled feathers. \xe2\x80\x98Ask the favour of\r\nthe lady\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lady\xe2\x80\x99s name is Lammle. The lady will not detain Mr Twemlow longer\r\nthan a very few minutes. The lady is sure that Mr Twemlow will do her\r\nthe kindness to see her, on being told that she particularly desires\r\na short interview. The lady has no doubt whatever of Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliance when he hears her name. Has begged the servant to be\r\nparticular not to mistake her name. Would have sent in a card, but has\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show the lady in.\xe2\x80\x99 Lady shown in, comes in.\r\n\r\nMr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s little rooms are modestly furnished, in an old-fashioned\r\nmanner (rather like the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room at Snigsworthy Park), and\r\nwould be bare of mere ornament, were it not for a full-length engraving\r\nof the sublime Snigsworth over the chimneypiece, snorting at a\r\nCorinthian column, with an enormous roll of paper at his feet, and a\r\nheavy curtain going to tumble down on his head; those accessories being\r\nunderstood to represent the noble lord as somehow in the act of saving\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray take a seat, Mrs Lammle.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle takes a seat and opens the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt, Mr Twemlow, that you have heard of a reverse of\r\nfortune having befallen us. Of course you have heard of it, for no kind\r\nof news travels so fast--among one\xe2\x80\x99s friends especially.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMindful of the wondering dinner, Twemlow, with a little twinge, admits\r\nthe imputation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Probably it will not,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Lammle, with a certain hardened manner\r\nupon her, that makes Twemlow shrink, \xe2\x80\x98have surprised you so much as some\r\nothers, after what passed between us at the house which is now turned\r\nout at windows. I have taken the liberty of calling upon you, Mr\r\nTwemlow, to add a sort of postscript to what I said that day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s dry and hollow cheeks become more dry and hollow at the\r\nprospect of some new complication.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,\xe2\x80\x99 says the uneasy little gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98really, Mrs Lammle, I\r\nshould take it as a favour if you could excuse me from any further\r\nconfidence. It has ever been one of the objects of my life--which,\r\nunfortunately, has not had many objects--to be inoffensive, and to keep\r\nout of cabals and interferences.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle, by far the more observant of the two, scarcely finds it\r\nnecessary to look at Twemlow while he speaks, so easily does she read\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My postscript--to retain the term I have used\xe2\x80\x99--says Mrs Lammle, fixing\r\nher eyes on his face, to enforce what she says herself--\xe2\x80\x98coincides\r\nexactly with what you say, Mr Twemlow. So far from troubling you with\r\nany new confidence, I merely wish to remind you what the old one was. So\r\nfar from asking you for interference, I merely wish to claim your strict\r\nneutrality.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow going on to reply, she rests her eyes again, knowing her ears to\r\nbe quite enough for the contents of so weak a vessel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, nervously, \xe2\x80\x98offer no reasonable\r\nobjection to hearing anything that you do me the honour to wish to say\r\nto me under those heads. But if I may, with all possible delicacy and\r\npoliteness, entreat you not to range beyond them, I--I beg to do so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Lammle, raising her eyes to his face again, and quite\r\ndaunting him with her hardened manner, \xe2\x80\x98I imparted to you a certain\r\npiece of knowledge, to be imparted again, as you thought best, to a\r\ncertain person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which I did,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And for doing which, I thank you; though, indeed, I scarcely know why\r\nI turned traitress to my husband in the matter, for the girl is a poor\r\nlittle fool. I was a poor little fool once myself; I can find no better\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x99 Seeing the effect she produces on him by her indifferent laugh\r\nand cold look, she keeps her eyes upon him as she proceeds. \xe2\x80\x98Mr Twemlow,\r\nif you should chance to see my husband, or to see me, or to see both of\r\nus, in the favour or confidence of any one else--whether of our common\r\nacquaintance or not, is of no consequence--you have no right to use\r\nagainst us the knowledge I intrusted you with, for one special purpose\r\nwhich has been accomplished. This is what I came to say. It is not a\r\nstipulation; to a gentleman it is simply a reminder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow sits murmuring to himself with his hand to his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so plain a case,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle goes on, \xe2\x80\x98as between me (from the\r\nfirst relying on your honour) and you, that I will not waste another\r\nword upon it.\xe2\x80\x99 She looks steadily at Mr Twemlow, until, with a shrug,\r\nhe makes her a little one-sided bow, as though saying \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think you\r\nhave a right to rely upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 and then she moistens her lips, and shows\r\na sense of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I trust I have kept the promise I made through your servant, that I\r\nwould detain you a very few minutes. I need trouble you no longer, Mr\r\nTwemlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay!\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, rising as she rises. \xe2\x80\x98Pardon me a moment. I should\r\nnever have sought you out, madam, to say what I am going to say, but\r\nsince you have sought me out and are here, I will throw it off my mind.\r\nWas it quite consistent, in candour, with our taking that resolution\r\nagainst Mr Fledgeby, that you should afterwards address Mr Fledgeby as\r\nyour dear and confidential friend, and entreat a favour of Mr Fledgeby?\r\nAlways supposing that you did; I assert no knowledge of my own on the\r\nsubject; it has been represented to me that you did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he told you?\xe2\x80\x99 retorts Mrs Lammle, who again has saved her eyes\r\nwhile listening, and uses them with strong effect while speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is strange that he should have told you the truth,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs\r\nLammle, seriously pondering. \xe2\x80\x98Pray where did a circumstance so very\r\nextraordinary happen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwemlow hesitates. He is shorter than the lady as well as weaker, and,\r\nas she stands above him with her hardened manner and her well-used eyes,\r\nhe finds himself at such a disadvantage that he would like to be of the\r\nopposite sex.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask where it happened, Mr Twemlow? In strict confidence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must confess,\xe2\x80\x99 says the mild little gentleman, coming to his answer\r\nby degrees, \xe2\x80\x98that I felt some compunctions when Mr Fledgeby mentioned\r\nit. I must admit that I could not regard myself in an agreeable light.\r\nMore particularly, as Mr Fledgeby did, with great civility, which I\r\ncould not feel that I deserved from him, render me the same service that\r\nyou had entreated him to render you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is a part of the true nobility of the poor gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s soul to say\r\nthis last sentence. \xe2\x80\x98Otherwise,\xe2\x80\x99 he has reflected, \xe2\x80\x98I shall assume the\r\nsuperior position of having no difficulties of my own, while I know of\r\nhers. Which would be mean, very mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy as effectual in your case as in ours?\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs\r\nLammle demands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As ineffectual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you make up your mind to tell me where you saw Mr Fledgeby, Mr\r\nTwemlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon. I fully intended to have done so. The reservation\r\nwas not intentional. I encountered Mr Fledgeby, quite by accident, on\r\nthe spot.--By the expression, on the spot, I mean at Mr Riah\xe2\x80\x99s in Saint\r\nMary Axe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you the misfortune to be in Mr Riah\xe2\x80\x99s hands then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Twemlow, \xe2\x80\x98the one money obligation to\r\nwhich I stand committed, the one debt of my life (but it is a just debt;\r\npray observe that I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute it), has fallen into Mr Riah\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Twemlow,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Lammle, fixing his eyes with hers: which he would\r\nprevent her doing if he could, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t; \xe2\x80\x98it has fallen into Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Mr Riah is his mask. It has fallen into Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. Let me tell you that, for your guidance. The information may be\r\nof use to you, if only to prevent your credulity, in judging another\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s truthfulness by your own, from being imposed upon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible!\xe2\x80\x99 cries Twemlow, standing aghast. \xe2\x80\x98How do you know it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I scarcely know how I know it. The whole train of circumstances seemed\r\nto take fire at once, and show it to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Then you have no proof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very strange,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Lammle, coldly and boldly, and with some\r\ndisdain, \xe2\x80\x98how like men are to one another in some things, though their\r\ncharacters are as different as can be! No two men can have less affinity\r\nbetween them, one would say, than Mr Twemlow and my husband. Yet my\r\nhusband replies to me \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no proof,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr Twemlow replies to me\r\nwith the very same words!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But why, madam?\xe2\x80\x99 Twemlow ventures gently to argue. \xe2\x80\x98Consider why\r\nthe very same words? Because they state the fact. Because you HAVE no\r\nproof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Men are very wise in their way,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Mrs Lammle, glancing haughtily\r\nat the Snigsworth portrait, and shaking out her dress before departing;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but they have wisdom to learn. My husband, who is not over-confiding,\r\ningenuous, or inexperienced, sees this plain thing no more than Mr\r\nTwemlow does--because there is no proof! Yet I believe five women out of\r\nsix, in my place, would see it as clearly as I do. However, I will never\r\nrest (if only in remembrance of Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s having kissed my hand)\r\nuntil my husband does see it. And you will do well for yourself to see\r\nit from this time forth, Mr Twemlow, though I CAN give you no proof.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she moves towards the door, Mr Twemlow, attending on her, expresses\r\nhis soothing hope that the condition of Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s affairs is not\r\nirretrievable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle answers, stopping, and sketching out the\r\npattern of the paper on the wall with the point of her parasol; \xe2\x80\x98it\r\ndepends. There may be an opening for him dawning now, or there may be\r\nnone. We shall soon find out. If none, we are bankrupt here, and must go\r\nabroad, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Twemlow, in his good-natured desire to make the best of it, remarks\r\nthat there are pleasant lives abroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Mrs Lammle, still sketching on the wall; \xe2\x80\x98but I doubt\r\nwhether billiard-playing, card-playing, and so forth, for the means to\r\nlive under suspicion at a dirty table-d\xe2\x80\x99hote, is one of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt is much for Mr Lammle, Twemlow politely intimates (though greatly\r\nshocked), to have one always beside him who is attached to him in all\r\nhis fortunes, and whose restraining influence will prevent him from\r\ncourses that would be discreditable and ruinous. As he says it, Mrs\r\nLammle leaves off sketching, and looks at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Restraining influence, Mr Twemlow? We must eat and drink, and dress,\r\nand have a roof over our heads. Always beside him and attached in all\r\nhis fortunes? Not much to boast of in that; what can a woman at my age\r\ndo? My husband and I deceived one another when we married; we must bear\r\nthe consequences of the deception--that is to say, bear one another, and\r\nbear the burden of scheming together for to-day\xe2\x80\x99s dinner and to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreakfast--till death divorces us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith those words, she walks out into Duke Street, Saint James\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr\r\nTwemlow returning to his sofa, lays down his aching head on its slippery\r\nlittle horsehair bolster, with a strong internal conviction that a\r\npainful interview is not the kind of thing to be taken after the dinner\r\npills which are so highly salutary in connexion with the pleasures of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nBut, six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening finds the worthy little gentleman\r\ngetting better, and also getting himself into his obsolete little silk\r\nstockings and pumps, for the wondering dinner at the Veneerings. And\r\nseven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening finds him trotting out into Duke Street, to\r\ntrot to the corner and save a sixpence in coach-hire.\r\n\r\nTippins the divine has dined herself into such a condition by this time,\r\nthat a morbid mind might desire her, for a blessed change, to sup\r\nat last, and turn into bed. Such a mind has Mr Eugene Wrayburn, whom\r\nTwemlow finds contemplating Tippins with the moodiest of visages,\r\nwhile that playful creature rallies him on being so long overdue at the\r\nwoolsack. Skittish is Tippins with Mortimer Lightwood too, and has raps\r\nto give him with her fan for having been best man at the nuptials of\r\nthese deceiving what\xe2\x80\x99s-their-names who have gone to pieces. Though,\r\nindeed, the fan is generally lively, and taps away at the men in\r\nall directions, with something of a grisly sound suggestive of the\r\nclattering of Lady Tippins\xe2\x80\x99s bones.\r\n\r\nA new race of intimate friends has sprung up at Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s since he\r\nwent into Parliament for the public good, to whom Mrs Veneering is very\r\nattentive. These friends, like astronomical distances, are only to be\r\nspoken of in the very largest figures. Boots says that one of them is a\r\nContractor who (it has been calculated) gives employment, directly and\r\nindirectly, to five hundred thousand men. Brewer says that another of\r\nthem is a Chairman, in such request at so many Boards, so far apart,\r\nthat he never travels less by railway than three thousand miles a week.\r\nBuffer says that another of them hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a sixpence eighteen months ago,\r\nand, through the brilliancy of his genius in getting those shares issued\r\nat eighty-five, and buying them all up with no money and selling them\r\nat par for cash, has now three hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\npounds--Buffer particularly insisting on the odd seventy-five, and\r\ndeclining to take a farthing less. With Buffer, Boots, and Brewer, Lady\r\nTippins is eminently facetious on the subject of these Fathers of the\r\nScrip-Church: surveying them through her eyeglass, and inquiring whether\r\nBoots and Brewer and Buffer think they will make her fortune if she\r\nmakes love to them? with other pleasantries of that nature. Veneering,\r\nin his different way, is much occupied with the Fathers too, piously\r\nretiring with them into the conservatory, from which retreat the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Committee\xe2\x80\x99 is occasionally heard, and where the Fathers instruct\r\nVeneering how he must leave the valley of the piano on his left,\r\ntake the level of the mantelpiece, cross by an open cutting at the\r\ncandelabra, seize the carrying-traffic at the console, and cut up the\r\nopposition root and branch at the window curtains.\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Podsnap are of the company, and the Fathers descry in Mrs\r\nPodsnap a fine woman. She is consigned to a Father--Boots\xe2\x80\x99s Father,\r\nwho employs five hundred thousand men--and is brought to anchor on\r\nVeneering\xe2\x80\x99s left; thus affording opportunity to the sportive Tippins on\r\nhis right (he, as usual, being mere vacant space), to entreat to be told\r\nsomething about those loves of Navvies, and whether they really do live\r\non raw beefsteaks, and drink porter out of their barrows. But, in spite\r\nof such little skirmishes it is felt that this was to be a wondering\r\ndinner, and that the wondering must not be neglected. Accordingly,\r\nBrewer, as the man who has the greatest reputation to sustain, becomes\r\nthe interpreter of the general instinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I took,\xe2\x80\x99 says Brewer in a favourable pause, \xe2\x80\x98a cab this morning, and I\r\nrattled off to that Sale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoots (devoured by envy) says, \xe2\x80\x98So did I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBuffer says, \xe2\x80\x98So did I\xe2\x80\x99; but can find nobody to care whether he did or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what was it like?\xe2\x80\x99 inquires Veneering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Brewer, looking about for anybody else to\r\naddress his answer to, and giving the preference to Lightwood; \xe2\x80\x98I assure\r\nyou, the things were going for a song. Handsome things enough, but\r\nfetching nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I heard this afternoon,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lightwood.\r\n\r\nBrewer begs to know now, would it be fair to ask a professional man\r\nhow--on--earth--these--people--ever--did--come--TO--such--A--total\r\nsmash? (Brewer\xe2\x80\x99s divisions being for emphasis.)\r\n\r\nLightwood replies that he was consulted certainly, but could give no\r\nopinion which would pay off the Bill of Sale, and therefore violates no\r\nconfidence in supposing that it came of their living beyond their means.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how,\xe2\x80\x99 says Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98CAN people do that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHah! That is felt on all hands to be a shot in the bull\xe2\x80\x99s eye. How CAN\r\npeople do that! The Analytical Chemist going round with champagne, looks\r\nvery much as if HE could give them a pretty good idea how people did\r\nthat, if he had a mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Veneering, laying down her fork to press her aquiline\r\nhands together at the tips of the fingers, and addressing the Father who\r\ntravels the three thousand miles per week: \xe2\x80\x98how a mother can look at\r\nher baby, and know that she lives beyond her husband\xe2\x80\x99s means, I cannot\r\nimagine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene suggests that Mrs Lammle, not being a mother, had no baby to look\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Veneering, \xe2\x80\x98but the principle is the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoots is clear that the principle is the same. So is Buffer. It is the\r\nunfortunate destiny of Buffer to damage a cause by espousing it. The\r\nrest of the company have meekly yielded to the proposition that the\r\nprinciple is the same, until Buffer says it is; when instantly a general\r\nmurmur arises that the principle is not the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x99 says the Father of the three hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand pounds, \xe2\x80\x98--if these people spoken of, occupied the\r\nposition of being in society--they were in society?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVeneering is bound to confess that they dined here, and were even\r\nmarried from here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues the Father, \xe2\x80\x98how even their living\r\nbeyond their means could bring them to what has been termed a total\r\nsmash. Because, there is always such a thing as an adjustment of\r\naffairs, in the case of people of any standing at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene (who would seem to be in a gloomy state of suggestiveness),\r\nsuggests, \xe2\x80\x98Suppose you have no means and live beyond them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis is too insolvent a state of things for the Father to entertain. It\r\nis too insolvent a state of things for any one with any self-respect\r\nto entertain, and is universally scouted. But, it is so amazing how any\r\npeople can have come to a total smash, that everybody feels bound to\r\naccount for it specially. One of the Fathers says, \xe2\x80\x98Gaming table.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnother of the Fathers says, \xe2\x80\x98Speculated without knowing that\r\nspeculation is a science.\xe2\x80\x99 Boots says \xe2\x80\x98Horses.\xe2\x80\x99 Lady Tippins says to her\r\nfan, \xe2\x80\x98Two establishments.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Podsnap, saying nothing, is referred\r\nto for his opinion; which he delivers as follows; much flushed and\r\nextremely angry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me. I desire to take no part in the discussion of these\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. I abhor the subject. It is an odious subject, an\r\noffensive subject, a subject that makes me sick, and I--\xe2\x80\x99 And with his\r\nfavourite right-arm flourish which sweeps away everything and settles it\r\nfor ever, Mr Podsnap sweeps these inconveniently unexplainable wretches\r\nwho have lived beyond their means and gone to total smash, off the face\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\nEugene, leaning back in his chair, is observing Mr Podsnap with an\r\nirreverent face, and may be about to offer a new suggestion, when\r\nthe Analytical is beheld in collision with the Coachman; the Coachman\r\nmanifesting a purpose of coming at the company with a silver salver,\r\nas though intent upon making a collection for his wife and family; the\r\nAnalytical cutting him off at the sideboard. The superior stateliness,\r\nif not the superior generalship, of the Analytical prevails over a man\r\nwho is as nothing off the box; and the Coachman, yielding up his salver,\r\nretires defeated.\r\n\r\nThen, the Analytical, perusing a scrap of paper lying on the salver,\r\nwith the air of a literary Censor, adjusts it, takes his time about\r\ngoing to the table with it, and presents it to Mr Eugene Wrayburn.\r\nWhereupon the pleasant Tippins says aloud, \xe2\x80\x98The Lord Chancellor has\r\nresigned!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith distracting coolness and slowness--for he knows the curiosity of\r\nthe Charmer to be always devouring--Eugene makes a pretence of getting\r\nout an eyeglass, polishing it, and reading the paper with difficulty,\r\nlong after he has seen what is written on it. What is written on it in\r\nwet ink, is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young Blight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Waiting?\xe2\x80\x99 says Eugene over his shoulder, in confidence, with the\r\nAnalytical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Waiting,\xe2\x80\x99 returns the Analytical in responsive confidence.\r\n\r\nEugene looks \xe2\x80\x98Excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 towards Mrs Veneering, goes out, and finds\r\nYoung Blight, Mortimer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk, at the hall-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You told me to bring him, sir, to wherever you was, if he come while\r\nyou was out and I was in,\xe2\x80\x99 says that discreet young gentleman, standing\r\non tiptoe to whisper; \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sharp boy. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s in a cab, sir, at the door. I thought it best not to show him, you\r\nsee, if it could be helped; for he\xe2\x80\x99s a-shaking all over, like--Blight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsimile is perhaps inspired by the surrounding dishes of sweets--\xe2\x80\x98like\r\nGlue Monge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sharp boy again,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGoes out straightway, and, leisurely leaning his arms on the open window\r\nof a cab in waiting, looks in at Mr Dolls: who has brought his own\r\natmosphere with him, and would seem from its odour to have brought it,\r\nfor convenience of carriage, in a rum-cask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now Dolls, wake up!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mist Wrayburn? Drection! Fifteen shillings!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter carefully reading the dingy scrap of paper handed to him, and as\r\ncarefully tucking it into his waistcoat pocket, Eugene tells out the\r\nmoney; beginning incautiously by telling the first shilling into Mr\r\nDolls\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which instantly jerks it out of window; and ending by\r\ntelling the fifteen shillings on the seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give him a ride back to Charing Cross, sharp boy, and there get rid of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReturning to the dining-room, and pausing for an instant behind the\r\nscreen at the door, Eugene overhears, above the hum and clatter, the\r\nfair Tippins saying: \xe2\x80\x98I am dying to ask him what he was called out for!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you?\xe2\x80\x99 mutters Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98then perhaps if you can\xe2\x80\x99t ask him, you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndie. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a benefactor to society, and go. A stroll and a cigar,\r\nand I can think this over. Think this over.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus, with a thoughtful\r\nface, he finds his hat and cloak, unseen of the Analytical, and goes his\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FOURTH -- A TURNING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\nSETTING TRAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nPlashwater Weir Mill Lock looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in\r\nthe summer time. A soft air stirred the leaves of the fresh green trees,\r\nand passed like a smooth shadow over the river, and like a smoother\r\nshadow over the yielding grass. The voice of the falling water, like\r\nthe voices of the sea and the wind, were as an outer memory to a\r\ncontemplative listener; but not particularly so to Mr Riderhood, who sat\r\non one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock-gates, dozing. Wine must\r\nbe got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out; and the\r\nwine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency,\r\nnothing in nature tapped him.\r\n\r\nAs the Rogue sat, ever and again nodding himself off his balance, his\r\nrecovery was always attended by an angry stare and growl, as if, in the\r\nabsence of any one else, he had aggressive inclinations towards himself.\r\nIn one of these starts the cry of \xe2\x80\x98Lock, ho! Lock!\xe2\x80\x99 prevented his\r\nrelapse into a doze. Shaking himself as he got up like the surly brute\r\nhe was, he gave his growl a responsive twist at the end, and turned his\r\nface down-stream to see who hailed.\r\n\r\nIt was an amateur-sculler, well up to his work though taking it easily,\r\nin so light a boat that the Rogue remarked: \xe2\x80\x98A little less on you, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d a\xe2\x80\x99most ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a Wagerbut\xe2\x80\x99; then went to work at his windlass\r\nhandles and sluices, to let the sculler in. As the latter stood in his\r\nboat, holding on by the boat-hook to the woodwork at the lock side,\r\nwaiting for the gates to open, Rogue Riderhood recognized his \xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99other\r\ngovernor,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Eugene Wrayburn; who was, however, too indifferent or too\r\nmuch engaged to recognize him.\r\n\r\nThe creaking lock-gates opened slowly, and the light boat passed in as\r\nsoon as there was room enough, and the creaking lock-gates closed upon\r\nit, and it floated low down in the dock between the two sets of gates,\r\nuntil the water should rise and the second gates should open and let it\r\nout. When Riderhood had run to his second windlass and turned it, and\r\nwhile he leaned against the lever of that gate to help it to swing\r\nopen presently, he noticed, lying to rest under the green hedge by the\r\ntowing-path astern of the Lock, a Bargeman.\r\n\r\nThe water rose and rose as the sluice poured in, dispersing the scum\r\nwhich had formed behind the lumbering gates, and sending the boat up,\r\nso that the sculler gradually rose like an apparition against the light\r\nfrom the bargeman\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. Riderhood observed that the bargeman\r\nrose too, leaning on his arm, and seemed to have his eyes fastened on\r\nthe rising figure.\r\n\r\nBut, there was the toll to be taken, as the gates were now complaining\r\nand opening. The T\xe2\x80\x99other governor tossed it ashore, twisted in a piece\r\nof paper, and as he did so, knew his man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay? It\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it, honest friend?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, seating himself\r\npreparatory to resuming his sculls. \xe2\x80\x98You got the place, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I got the place, and no thanks to you for it, nor yet none to Lawyer\r\nLightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 gruffly answered Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We saved our recommendation, honest fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98for the next\r\ncandidate--the one who will offer himself when you are transported or\r\nhanged. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be long about it; will you be so good?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo imperturbable was the air with which he gravely bent to his work that\r\nRiderhood remained staring at him, without having found a retort, until\r\nhe had rowed past a line of wooden objects by the weir, which showed\r\nlike huge teetotums standing at rest in the water, and was almost hidden\r\nby the drooping boughs on the left bank, as he rowed away, keeping\r\nout of the opposing current. It being then too late to retort with\r\nany effect--if that could ever have been done--the honest man confined\r\nhimself to cursing and growling in a grim under-tone. Having then\r\ngot his gates shut, he crossed back by his plank lock-bridge to the\r\ntowing-path side of the river.\r\n\r\nIf, in so doing, he took another glance at the bargeman, he did it by\r\nstealth. He cast himself on the grass by the Lock side, in an indolent\r\nway, with his back in that direction, and, having gathered a few blades,\r\nfell to chewing them. The dip of Eugene Wrayburn\xe2\x80\x99s sculls had become\r\nhardly audible in his ears when the bargeman passed him, putting the\r\nutmost width that he could between them, and keeping under the hedge.\r\nThen, Riderhood sat up and took a long look at his figure, and then\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x98Hi--I--i! Lock, ho! Lock! Plashwater Weir Mill Lock!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bargeman stopped, and looked back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest gov--er--nor--or--or--or!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nMr Riderhood, with his hands to his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe bargeman turned back. Approaching nearer and nearer, the bargeman\r\nbecame Bradley Headstone, in rough water-side second-hand clothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wish I may die,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, smiting his right leg, and laughing,\r\nas he sat on the grass, \xe2\x80\x98if you ain\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a imitating me,\r\nT\xe2\x80\x99otherest governor! Never thought myself so good-looking afore!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTruly, Bradley Headstone had taken careful note of the honest man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress in the course of that night-walk they had had together. He must\r\nhave committed it to memory, and slowly got it by heart. It was\r\nexactly reproduced in the dress he now wore. And whereas, in his own\r\nschoolmaster clothes, he usually looked as if they were the clothes of\r\nsome other man, he now looked, in the clothes of some other man or men,\r\nas if they were his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THIS your Lock?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, whose surprise had a genuine air; \xe2\x80\x98they\r\ntold me, where I last inquired, it was the third I should come to. This\r\nis only the second.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief, governor,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Riderhood, with a wink and shake of\r\nhis head, \xe2\x80\x98that you\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped one in your counting. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t Locks as\r\nYOU\xe2\x80\x99VE been giving your mind to. No, no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he expressively jerked his pointing finger in the direction the boat\r\nhad taken, a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he\r\nlooked anxiously up the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It ain\xe2\x80\x99t Locks as YOU\xe2\x80\x99VE been a reckoning up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, when the\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s eyes came back again. \xe2\x80\x98No, no!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What other calculations do you suppose I have been occupied with?\r\nMathematics?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never heerd it called that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long word for it. Hows\xe2\x80\x99ever,\r\np\xe2\x80\x99raps you call it so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, stubbornly chewing his grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It. What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll say them, instead of it, if you like,\xe2\x80\x99 was the coolly growled\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s safer talk too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean that I should understand by them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Spites, affronts, offences giv\xe2\x80\x99 and took, deadly aggrawations, such\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riderhood.\r\n\r\nDo what Bradley Headstone would, he could not keep that former flush of\r\nimpatience out of his face, or so master his eyes as to prevent their\r\nagain looking anxiously up the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha ha! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afeerd, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98The T\xe2\x80\x99other\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\nto make way agin the stream, and he takes it easy. You can soon come up\r\nwith him. But wot\xe2\x80\x99s the good of saying that to you! YOU know how fur\r\nyou could have outwalked him betwixt anywheres about where he lost the\r\ntide--say Richmond--and this, if you had a mind to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think I have been following him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I KNOW you have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! I have, I have,\xe2\x80\x99 Bradley admitted. \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 with another anxious\r\nlook up the river, \xe2\x80\x98he may land.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Easy you! He won\xe2\x80\x99t be lost if he does land,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98He must\r\nleave his boat behind him. He can\xe2\x80\x99t make a bundle or a parcel on it, and\r\ncarry it ashore with him under his arm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was speaking to you just now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, kneeling on one knee on\r\nthe grass beside the Lock-keeper. \xe2\x80\x98What did he say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cheek,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cheek,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Riderhood, with an angry oath; \xe2\x80\x98cheek is what he said.\r\nHe can\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing but cheek. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 liked to plump down aboard of\r\nhim, neck and crop, with a heavy jump, and sunk him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley turned away his haggard face for a few moments, and then said,\r\ntearing up a tuft of grass:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Damn him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hooroar!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Does you credit! Hooroar! I cry chorus to\r\nthe T\xe2\x80\x99otherest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What turn,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, with an effort at self-repression that forced\r\nhim to wipe his face, \xe2\x80\x98did his insolence take to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It took the turn,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Riderhood, with sullen ferocity, \xe2\x80\x98of hoping\r\nas I was getting ready to be hanged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let him look to that,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bradley. \xe2\x80\x98Let him look to that! It will\r\nbe bad for him when men he has injured, and at whom he has jeered, are\r\nthinking of getting hanged. Let HIM get ready for HIS fate, when that\r\ncomes about. There was more meaning in what he said than he knew of, or\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had brains enough to say it. Let him look to it; let\r\nhim look to it! When men he has wronged, and on whom he has bestowed\r\nhis insolence, are getting ready to be hanged, there is a death-bell\r\nringing. And not for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood, looking fixedly at him, gradually arose from his recumbent\r\nposture while the schoolmaster said these words with the utmost\r\nconcentration of rage and hatred. So, when the words were all spoken,\r\nhe too kneeled on one knee on the grass, and the two men looked at one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, very deliberately spitting out the grass he had\r\nbeen chewing. \xe2\x80\x98Then, I make out, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest, as he is a-going to her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He left London,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bradley, \xe2\x80\x98yesterday. I have hardly a doubt,\r\nthis time, that at last he is going to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ain\xe2\x80\x99t sure, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am as sure here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, with a clutch at the breast of his\r\ncoarse shirt, \xe2\x80\x98as if it was written there;\xe2\x80\x99 with a blow or a stab at the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! But judging from the looks on you,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Riderhood, completely\r\nridding himself of his grass, and drawing his sleeve across his mouth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ve made ekally sure afore, and have got disapinted. It has told\r\nupon you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, in a low voice, bending forward to lay his hand\r\nupon the Lock-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98These are my holidays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are they, by George!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Riderhood, with his eyes on the\r\npassion-wasted face. \xe2\x80\x98Your working days must be stiff \xe2\x80\x98uns, if these is\r\nyour holidays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I have never left him,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bradley, waving the interruption\r\naside with an impatient hand, \xe2\x80\x98since they began. And I never will leave\r\nhim now, till I have seen him with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when you have seen him with her?\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood stiffened the knee on which he had been resting, got up, and\r\nlooked gloomily at his new friend. After a few moments they walked side\r\nby side in the direction the boat had taken, as if by tacit consent;\r\nBradley pressing forward, and Riderhood holding back; Bradley getting\r\nout his neat prim purse into his hand (a present made him by penny\r\nsubscription among his pupils); and Riderhood, unfolding his arms to\r\nsmear his coat-cuff across his mouth with a thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have a pound for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve two,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\nBradley held a sovereign between his fingers. Slouching at his side with\r\nhis eyes upon the towing-path, Riderhood held his left hand open, with\r\na certain slight drawing action towards himself. Bradley dipped in his\r\npurse for another sovereign, and two chinked in Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s hand, the\r\ndrawing action of which, promptly strengthening, drew them home to his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I must follow him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley Headstone. \xe2\x80\x98He takes this\r\nriver-road--the fool!--to confuse observation, or divert attention, if\r\nnot solely to baffle me. But he must have the power of making himself\r\ninvisible before he can shake Me off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood stopped. \xe2\x80\x98If you don\xe2\x80\x99t get disapinted agin, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest, maybe\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll put up at the Lock-house when you come back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood nodded, and the figure of the bargeman went its way along the\r\nsoft turf by the side of the towing-path, keeping near the hedge and\r\nmoving quickly. They had turned a point from which a long stretch of\r\nriver was visible. A stranger to the scene might have been certain that\r\nhere and there along the line of hedge a figure stood, watching the\r\nbargeman, and waiting for him to come up. So he himself had often\r\nbelieved at first, until his eyes became used to the posts, bearing the\r\ndagger that slew Wat Tyler, in the City of London shield.\r\n\r\nWithin Mr Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge all daggers were as one. Even to Bradley\r\nHeadstone, who could have told to the letter without book all about Wat\r\nTyler, Lord Mayor Walworth, and the King, that it is dutiful for youth\r\nto know, there was but one subject living in the world for every sharp\r\ndestructive instrument that summer evening. So, Riderhood looking after\r\nhim as he went, and he with his furtive hand laid upon the dagger as he\r\npassed it, and his eyes upon the boat, were much upon a par.\r\n\r\nThe boat went on, under the arching trees, and over their tranquil\r\nshadows in the water. The bargeman skulking on the opposite bank of the\r\nstream, went on after it. Sparkles of light showed Riderhood when\r\nand where the rower dipped his blades, until, even as he stood idly\r\nwatching, the sun went down and the landscape was dyed red. And then the\r\nred had the appearance of fading out of it and mounting up to Heaven, as\r\nwe say that blood, guiltily shed, does.\r\n\r\nTurning back towards his Lock (he had not gone out of view of it), the\r\nRogue pondered as deeply as it was within the contracted power of such\r\na fellow to do. \xe2\x80\x98Why did he copy my clothes? He could have looked like\r\nwhat he wanted to look like, without that.\xe2\x80\x99 This was the subject-matter\r\nin his thoughts; in which, too, there came lumbering up, by times, like\r\nany half floating and half sinking rubbish in the river, the question,\r\nWas it done by accident? The setting of a trap for finding out whether\r\nit was accidentally done, soon superseded, as a practical piece of\r\ncunning, the abstruser inquiry why otherwise it was done. And he devised\r\na means.\r\n\r\nRogue Riderhood went into his Lock-house, and brought forth, into the\r\nnow sober grey light, his chest of clothes. Sitting on the grass beside\r\nit, he turned out, one by one, the articles it contained, until he came\r\nto a conspicuous bright red neckerchief stained black here and there by\r\nwear. It arrested his attention, and he sat pausing over it, until he\r\ntook off the rusty colourless wisp that he wore round his throat, and\r\nsubstituted the red neckerchief, leaving the long ends flowing. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Rogue, \xe2\x80\x98if arter he sees me in this neckhankecher, I see him in\r\na sim\xe2\x80\x99lar neckhankecher, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be accident!\xe2\x80\x99 Elated by his device, he\r\ncarried his chest in again and went to supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lock ho! Lock!\xe2\x80\x99 It was a light night, and a barge coming down summoned\r\nhim out of a long doze. In due course he had let the barge through\r\nand was alone again, looking to the closing of his gates, when Bradley\r\nHeadstone appeared before him, standing on the brink of the Lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Back a\xe2\x80\x99 ready, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has put up for the night, at an Angler\xe2\x80\x99s Inn,\xe2\x80\x99 was the fatigued and\r\nhoarse reply. \xe2\x80\x98He goes on, up the river, at six in the morning. I have\r\ncome back for a couple of hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, making towards the schoolmaster by his\r\nplank bridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bradley, irritably, \xe2\x80\x98because I would\r\nrather not have them, but would much prefer to follow him all night.\r\nHowever, if he won\xe2\x80\x99t lead, I can\xe2\x80\x99t follow. I have been waiting about,\r\nuntil I could discover, for a certainty, at what time he starts; if I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made sure of it, I should have stayed there.--This would\r\nbe a bad pit for a man to be flung into with his hands tied. These\r\nslippery smooth walls would give him no chance. And I suppose those\r\ngates would suck him down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suck him down, or swaller him up, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not even, if his hands warn\xe2\x80\x99t tied, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Shut him in at both\r\nends, and I\xe2\x80\x99d give him a pint o\xe2\x80\x99 old ale ever to come up to me standing\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley looked down with a ghastly relish. \xe2\x80\x98You run about the brink, and\r\nrun across it, in this uncertain light, on a few inches width of rotten\r\nwood,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I wonder you have no thought of being drowned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t be drowned?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, shaking his head with an air of thorough\r\nconviction, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s well known. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been brought out o\xe2\x80\x99 drowning, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be drowned. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have that there busted B\xe2\x80\x99lowbridger aware\r\non it, or her people might make it tell agin\xe2\x80\x99 the damages I mean to get.\r\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s well known to water-side characters like myself, that him as\r\nhas been brought out o drowning, can never be drowned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley smiled sourly at the ignorance he would have corrected in one of\r\nhis pupils, and continued to look down into the water, as if the place\r\nhad a gloomy fascination for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem to like it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\nHe took no notice, but stood looking down, as if he had not heard the\r\nwords. There was a very dark expression on his face; an expression\r\nthat the Rogue found it hard to understand. It was fierce, and full\r\nof purpose; but the purpose might have been as much against himself as\r\nagainst another. If he had stepped back for a spring, taken a leap, and\r\nthrown himself in, it would have been no surprising sequel to the look.\r\nPerhaps his troubled soul, set upon some violence, did hover for the\r\nmoment between that violence and another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riderhood, after watching him for a while with\r\na sidelong glance, \xe2\x80\x98as you had come back for a couple o\xe2\x80\x99 hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut, even then he had to jog him with his elbow before he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better come in and take your couple o\xe2\x80\x99 hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the look of one just awakened, he followed Riderhood into the\r\nLock-house, where the latter produced from a cupboard some cold salt\r\nbeef and half a loaf, some gin in a bottle, and some water in a jug. The\r\nlast he brought in, cool and dripping, from the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, stooping over him to put it on\r\nthe table. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better take a bite and a sup, afore you takes\r\nyour snooze.\xe2\x80\x99 The draggling ends of the red neckerchief caught the\r\nschoolmaster\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Riderhood saw him look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 thought that worthy. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a-taking notice, are you? Come! You\r\nshall have a good squint at it then.\xe2\x80\x99 With which reflection he sat down\r\non the other side of the table, threw open his vest, and made a pretence\r\nof re-tying the neckerchief with much deliberation.\r\n\r\nBradley ate and drank. As he sat at his platter and mug, Riderhood saw\r\nhim, again and yet again, steal a look at the neckerchief, as if he were\r\ncorrecting his slow observation and prompting his sluggish memory.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for your snooze,\xe2\x80\x99 said that honest creature, \xe2\x80\x98chuck\r\nyourself on my bed in the corner, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be broad day afore\r\nthree. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you early.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall require no calling,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bradley. And soon afterwards,\r\ndivesting himself only of his shoes and coat, laid himself down.\r\n\r\nRiderhood, leaning back in his wooden arm-chair with his arms folded\r\non his breast, looked at him lying with his right hand clenched in his\r\nsleep and his teeth set, until a film came over his own sight, and he\r\nslept too. He awoke to find that it was daylight, and that his\r\nvisitor was already astir, and going out to the river-side to cool his\r\nhead:--\xe2\x80\x98Though I\xe2\x80\x99m blest,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Riderhood at the Lock-house door,\r\nlooking after him, \xe2\x80\x98if I think there\xe2\x80\x99s water enough in all the Thames\r\nto do THAT for you!\xe2\x80\x99 Within five minutes he had taken his departure,\r\nand was passing on into the calm distance as he had passed yesterday.\r\nRiderhood knew when a fish leaped, by his starting and glancing round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lock ho! Lock!\xe2\x80\x99 at intervals all day, and \xe2\x80\x98Lock ho! Lock!\xe2\x80\x99 thrice in\r\nthe ensuing night, but no return of Bradley. The second day was sultry\r\nand oppressive. In the afternoon, a thunderstorm came up, and had but\r\nnewly broken into a furious sweep of rain when he rushed in at the door,\r\nlike the storm itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him with her!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Riderhood, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At his journey\xe2\x80\x99s end. His boat\xe2\x80\x99s hauled up for three days. I heard\r\nhim give the order. Then, I saw him wait for her and meet her. I saw\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x99--he stopped as though he were suffocating, and began again--\xe2\x80\x98I saw\r\nthem walking side by side, last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe dropped into a chair, and laughed. Immediately afterwards, a great\r\nspirt of blood burst from his nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How does that happen?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it back. It has happened twice--three\r\ntimes--four times--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many times--since last night. I\r\ntaste it, smell it, see it, it chokes me, and then it breaks out like\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went into the pelting rain again with his head bare, and, bending low\r\nover the river, and scooping up the water with his two hands, washed the\r\nblood away. All beyond his figure, as Riderhood looked from the door,\r\nwas a vast dark curtain in solemn movement towards one quarter of the\r\nheavens. He raised his head and came back, wet from head to foot, but\r\nwith the lower parts of his sleeves, where he had dipped into the river,\r\nstreaming water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your face is like a ghost\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever see a ghost?\xe2\x80\x99 was the sullen retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean to say, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite wore out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may well be. I have had no rest since I left here. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember that I have so much as sat down since I left here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lie down now, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll give me something to quench my thirst first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bottle and jug were again produced, and he mixed a weak draught, and\r\nanother, and drank both in quick succession. \xe2\x80\x98You asked me something,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bradley, turning upon him in a wild and desperate\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98you asked me something, before I went out to wash my face in\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, backing a little. \xe2\x80\x98I asked you wot you wos\r\na-going to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can a man in this state know?\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, protesting with both\r\nhis tremulous hands, with an action so vigorously angry that he shook\r\nthe water from his sleeves upon the floor, as if he had wrung them. \xe2\x80\x98How\r\ncan I plan anything, if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t sleep?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I as good as said,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say\r\nlie down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, perhaps you did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! Anyways I says it again. Sleep where you slept last; the sounder\r\nand longer you can sleep, the better you\xe2\x80\x99ll know arterwards what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nup to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis pointing to the truckle bed in the corner, seemed gradually to bring\r\nthat poor couch to Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s wandering remembrance. He slipped off his\r\nworn down-trodden shoes, and cast himself heavily, all wet as he was,\r\nupon the bed.\r\n\r\nRiderhood sat down in his wooden arm-chair, and looked through the\r\nwindow at the lightning, and listened to the thunder. But, his thoughts\r\nwere far from being absorbed by the thunder and the lightning, for again\r\nand again and again he looked very curiously at the exhausted man upon\r\nthe bed. The man had turned up the collar of the rough coat he wore,\r\nto shelter himself from the storm, and had buttoned it about his neck.\r\nUnconscious of that, and of most things, he had left the coat so, both\r\nwhen he had laved his face in the river, and when he had cast himself\r\nupon the bed; though it would have been much easier to him if he had\r\nunloosened it.\r\n\r\nThe thunder rolled heavily, and the forked lightning seemed to make\r\njagged rents in every part of the vast curtain without, as Riderhood sat\r\nby the window, glancing at the bed. Sometimes, he saw the man upon the\r\nbed, by a red light; sometimes, by a blue; sometimes, he scarcely saw\r\nhim in the darkness of the storm; sometimes he saw nothing of him in\r\nthe blinding glare of palpitating white fire. Anon, the rain would come\r\nagain with a tremendous rush, and the river would seem to rise to meet\r\nit, and a blast of wind, bursting upon the door, would flutter the hair\r\nand dress of the man, as if invisible messengers were come around the\r\nbed to carry him away. From all these phases of the storm, Riderhood\r\nwould turn, as if they were interruptions--rather striking interruptions\r\npossibly, but interruptions still--of his scrutiny of the sleeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He sleeps sound,\xe2\x80\x99 he said within himself; \xe2\x80\x98yet he\xe2\x80\x99s that up to me and\r\nthat noticing of me that my getting out of my chair may wake him, when a\r\nrattling peal won\xe2\x80\x99t; let alone my touching of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe very cautiously rose to his feet. \xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99otherest,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a low,\r\ncalm voice, \xe2\x80\x98are you a lying easy? There\xe2\x80\x99s a chill in the air, governor.\r\nShall I put a coat over you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s about what it is a\xe2\x80\x99ready, you see,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Riderhood in a\r\nlower and a different voice; \xe2\x80\x98a coat over you, a coat over you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sleeper moving an arm, he sat down again in his chair, and feigned\r\nto watch the storm from the window. It was a grand spectacle, but not so\r\ngrand as to keep his eyes, for half a minute together, from stealing a\r\nlook at the man upon the bed.\r\n\r\nIt was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often\r\nlooked so curiously, until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor\r\nof the dead-tired in mind and body. Then, Riderhood came from the window\r\ncautiously, and stood by the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor man!\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured in a low tone, with a crafty face, and a very\r\nwatchful eye and ready foot, lest he should start up; \xe2\x80\x98this here coat\r\nof his must make him uneasy in his sleep. Shall I loosen it for him,\r\nand make him more comfortable? Ah! I think I ought to do it, poor man. I\r\nthink I will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe touched the first button with a very cautious hand, and a step\r\nbackward. But, the sleeper remaining in profound unconsciousness, he\r\ntouched the other buttons with a more assured hand, and perhaps the more\r\nlightly on that account. Softly and slowly, he opened the coat and drew\r\nit back.\r\n\r\nThe draggling ends of a bright-red neckerchief were then disclosed, and\r\nhe had even been at the pains of dipping parts of it in some liquid,\r\nto give it the appearance of having become stained by wear. With a\r\nmuch-perplexed face, Riderhood looked from it to the sleeper, and from\r\nthe sleeper to it, and finally crept back to his chair, and there, with\r\nhis hand to his chin, sat long in a brown study, looking at both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN DUSTMAN RISES A LITTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Lammle had come to breakfast with Mr and Mrs Boffin. They\r\nwere not absolutely uninvited, but had pressed themselves with so much\r\nurgency on the golden couple, that evasion of the honour and pleasure\r\nof their company would have been difficult, if desired. They were in a\r\ncharming state of mind, were Mr and Mrs Lammle, and almost as fond of Mr\r\nand Mrs Boffin as of one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98it imparts new life to me, to\r\nsee my Alfred in confidential communication with Mr Boffin. The two\r\nwere formed to become intimate. So much simplicity combined with so much\r\nforce of character, such natural sagacity united to such amiability and\r\ngentleness--these are the distinguishing characteristics of both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis being said aloud, gave Mr Lammle an opportunity, as he came with Mr\r\nBoffin from the window to the breakfast table, of taking up his dear and\r\nhonoured wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 said that gentleman, \xe2\x80\x98your too partial estimate of your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s character--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! Not too partial, Alfred,\xe2\x80\x99 urged the lady, tenderly moved; \xe2\x80\x98never\r\nsay that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My child, your favourable opinion, then, of your husband--you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nobject to that phrase, darling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I, Alfred?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your favourable opinion then, my Precious, does less than justice to Mr\r\nBoffin, and more than justice to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the first charge, Alfred, I plead guilty. But to the second, oh no,\r\nno!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Less than justice to Mr Boffin, Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Lammle, soaring\r\ninto a tone of moral grandeur, \xe2\x80\x98because it represents Mr Boffin as on my\r\nlower level; more than justice to me, Sophronia, because it represents\r\nme as on Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s higher level. Mr Boffin bears and forbears far more\r\nthan I could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Far more than you could for yourself, Alfred?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love, that is not the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the question, Lawyer?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, archly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, dear Sophronia. From my lower level, I regard Mr Boffin as too\r\ngenerous, as possessed of too much clemency, as being too good to\r\npersons who are unworthy of him and ungrateful to him. To those noble\r\nqualities I can lay no claim. On the contrary, they rouse my indignation\r\nwhen I see them in action.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alfred!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They rouse my indignation, my dear, against the unworthy persons,\r\nand give me a combative desire to stand between Mr Boffin and all such\r\npersons. Why? Because, in my lower nature I am more worldly and less\r\ndelicate. Not being so magnanimous as Mr Boffin, I feel his injuries\r\nmore than he does himself, and feel more capable of opposing his\r\ninjurers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt struck Mrs Lammle that it appeared rather difficult this morning\r\nto bring Mr and Mrs Boffin into agreeable conversation. Here had been\r\nseveral lures thrown out, and neither of them had uttered a word. Here\r\nwere she, Mrs Lammle, and her husband discoursing at once affectingly\r\nand effectively, but discoursing alone. Assuming that the dear old\r\ncreatures were impressed by what they heard, still one would like to be\r\nsure of it, the more so, as at least one of the dear old creatures\r\nwas somewhat pointedly referred to. If the dear old creatures were too\r\nbashful or too dull to assume their required places in the discussion,\r\nwhy then it would seem desirable that the dear old creatures should be\r\ntaken by their heads and shoulders and brought into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But is not my husband saying in effect,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs Lammle, therefore,\r\nwith an innocent air, of Mr and Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that he becomes unmindful\r\nof his own temporary misfortunes in his admiration of another whom he is\r\nburning to serve? And is not that making an admission that his nature is\r\na generous one? I am wretched in argument, but surely this is so, dear\r\nMr and Mrs Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill, neither Mr and Mrs Boffin said a word. He sat with his eyes on\r\nhis plate, eating his muffins and ham, and she sat shyly looking at the\r\nteapot. Mrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s innocent appeal was merely thrown into the air, to\r\nmingle with the steam of the urn. Glancing towards Mr and Mrs Boffin,\r\nshe very slightly raised her eyebrows, as though inquiring of her\r\nhusband: \xe2\x80\x98Do I notice anything wrong here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle, who had found his chest effective on a variety of occasions,\r\nmanoeuvred his capacious shirt front into the largest demonstration\r\npossible, and then smiling retorted on his wife, thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, darling, Mr and Mrs Boffin will remind you of the old adage,\r\nthat self-praise is no recommendation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Self-praise, Alfred? Do you mean because we are one and the same?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear child. I mean that you cannot fail to remember, if you\r\nreflect for a single moment, that what you are pleased to compliment me\r\nupon feeling in the case of Mr Boffin, you have yourself confided to me\r\nas your own feeling in the case of Mrs Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98I shall be beaten by this Lawyer,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle gaily whispered to\r\nMrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I must admit it, if he presses me, for it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndamagingly true.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\nSeveral white dints began to come and go about Mr Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s nose, as he\r\nobserved that Mrs Boffin merely looked up from the teapot for a moment\r\nwith an embarrassed smile, which was no smile, and then looked down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you admit the charge, Sophronia?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Alfred, in a rallying\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, still gaily, \xe2\x80\x98I must throw myself\r\non the protection of the Court. Am I bound to answer that question, my\r\nLord?\xe2\x80\x99 To Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 was his answer. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not of\r\nthe least consequence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth husband and wife glanced at him, very doubtfully. His manner was\r\ngrave, but not coarse, and derived some dignity from a certain repressed\r\ndislike of the tone of the conversation.\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs Lammle raised her eyebrows for instruction from her husband.\r\nHe replied in a slight nod, \xe2\x80\x98Try \xe2\x80\x98em again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To protect myself against the suspicion of covert self-laudation, my\r\ndear Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the airy Mrs Lammle therefore, \xe2\x80\x98I must tell you\r\nhow it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin interposed.\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle turned to him laughingly. \xe2\x80\x98The Court objects?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98the Court (if I am the Court) does object. The\r\nCourt objects for two reasons. First, because the Court don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\nfair. Secondly, because the dear old lady, Mrs Court (if I am Mr) gets\r\ndistressed by it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA very remarkable wavering between two bearings--between her\r\npropitiatory bearing there, and her defiant bearing at Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s--was\r\nobservable on the part of Mrs Lammle as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does the Court not consider fair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Letting you go on,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Boffin, nodding his head soothingly, as\r\nwho should say, We won\xe2\x80\x99t be harder on you than we can help; we\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nthe best of it. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not above-board and it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. When the old\r\nlady is uncomfortable, there\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be good reason for it. I see she\r\nis uncomfortable, and I plainly see this is the good reason wherefore.\r\nHAVE you breakfasted, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle, settling into her defiant manner, pushed her plate away,\r\nlooked at her husband, and laughed; but by no means gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have YOU breakfasted, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Alfred, showing all his teeth. \xe2\x80\x98If Mrs Boffin will\r\noblige me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take another cup of tea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spilled a little of it over the chest which ought to have been so\r\neffective, and which had done so little; but on the whole drank it with\r\nsomething of an air, though the coming and going dints got almost as\r\nlarge, the while, as if they had been made by pressure of the teaspoon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A thousand thanks,\xe2\x80\x99 he then observed. \xe2\x80\x98I have breakfasted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, which,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin softly, taking out a pocket-book, \xe2\x80\x98which of\r\nyou two is Cashier?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked her husband, as he leaned back in his\r\nchair, waving his right hand towards her, while he hung his left hand\r\nby the thumb in the arm-hole of his waistcoat: \xe2\x80\x98it shall be your\r\ndepartment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would rather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that it was your husband\xe2\x80\x99s, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nbecause--but never mind, because, I would rather have to do with him.\r\nHowever, what I have to say, I will say with as little offence as\r\npossible; if I can say it without any, I shall be heartily glad. You two\r\nhave done me a service, a very great service, in doing what you did (my\r\nold lady knows what it was), and I have put into this envelope a bank\r\nnote for a hundred pound. I consider the service well worth a hundred\r\npound, and I am well pleased to pay the money. Would you do me the\r\nfavour to take it, and likewise to accept my thanks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a haughty action, and without looking towards him, Mrs Lammle held\r\nout her left hand, and into it Mr Boffin put the little packet. When she\r\nhad conveyed it to her bosom, Mr Lammle had the appearance of feeling\r\nrelieved, and breathing more freely, as not having been quite certain\r\nthat the hundred pounds were his, until the note had been safely\r\ntransferred out of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s keeping into his own Sophronia\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not impossible,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, addressing Alfred, \xe2\x80\x98that you\r\nhave had some general idea, sir, of replacing Rokesmith, in course of\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Alfred, with a glittering smile and a great deal\r\nof nose, \xe2\x80\x98not impossible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And perhaps, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Boffin, addressing Sophronia, \xe2\x80\x98you have\r\nbeen so kind as to take up my old lady in your own mind, and to do her\r\nthe honour of turning the question over whether you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t one of\r\nthese days have her in charge, like? Whether you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be a sort of\r\nMiss Bella Wilfer to her, and something more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should hope,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Lammle, with a scornful look and in a loud\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x98that if I were anything to your wife, sir, I could hardly fail\r\nto be something more than Miss Bella Wilfer, as you call her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do YOU call her, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle disdained to reply, and sat defiantly beating one foot on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again I think I may say, that\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible. Is it, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr\r\nBoffin, turning to Alfred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Alfred, smiling assent as before, \xe2\x80\x98not impossible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, gently, \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to say a\r\nsingle word that might be afterwards remembered as unpleasant; but it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 her husband repeated in a bantering manner, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nhear? It won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with his voice still dropped, \xe2\x80\x98it really won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nYou positively must excuse us. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll go your way, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go ours, and\r\nso I hope this affair ends to the satisfaction of all parties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle gave him the look of a decidedly dissatisfied party demanding\r\nexemption from the category; but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best thing we can make of the affair,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98is a matter\r\nof business, and as a matter of business it\xe2\x80\x99s brought to a conclusion.\r\nYou have done me a great service, a very great service, and I have paid\r\nfor it. Is there any objection to the price?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Lammle looked at one another across the table, but neither\r\ncould say that there was. Mr Lammle shrugged his shoulders, and Mrs\r\nLammle sat rigid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98We hope (my old lady and me) that you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive us credit for taking the plainest and honestest short-cut that\r\ncould be taken under the circumstances. We have talked it over with a\r\ndeal of care (my old lady and me), and we have felt that at all to lead\r\nyou on, or even at all to let you go on of your own selves, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nthe right thing. So, I have openly given you to understand that--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Boffin sought for a new turn of speech, but could find none so\r\nexpressive as his former one, repeated in a confidential tone, \xe2\x80\x98--that\r\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t do. If I could have put the case more pleasantly I would; but\r\nI hope I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put it very unpleasantly; at all events I haven\xe2\x80\x99t meant\r\nto. So,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, by way of peroration, \xe2\x80\x98wishing you well in the\r\nway you go, we now conclude with the observation that perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Lammle rose with an impudent laugh on his side of the table, and Mrs\r\nLammle rose with a disdainful frown on hers. At this moment a hasty foot\r\nwas heard on the staircase, and Georgiana Podsnap broke into the room,\r\nunannounced and in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Georgiana, wringing her hands as she ran\r\nup to embrace her, \xe2\x80\x98to think that you and Alfred should be ruined! Oh,\r\nmy poor dear Sophronia, to think that you should have had a Sale at your\r\nhouse after all your kindness to me! Oh, Mr and Mrs Boffin, pray forgive\r\nme for this intrusion, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how fond I was of Sophronia\r\nwhen Pa wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me go there any more, or what I have felt for\r\nSophronia since I heard from Ma of her having been brought low in the\r\nworld. You don\xe2\x80\x99t, you can\xe2\x80\x99t, you never can, think, how I have lain awake\r\nat night and cried for my good Sophronia, my first and only friend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle\xe2\x80\x99s manner changed under the poor silly girl\xe2\x80\x99s embraces, and\r\nshe turned extremely pale: directing one appealing look, first to Mrs\r\nBoffin, and then to Mr Boffin. Both understood her instantly, with\r\na more delicate subtlety than much better educated people, whose\r\nperception came less directly from the heart, could have brought to bear\r\nupon the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 said poor little Georgiana, \xe2\x80\x98to stay. I am out\r\nshopping early with Ma, and I said I had a headache and got Ma to leave\r\nme outside in the phaeton, in Piccadilly, and ran round to Sackville\r\nStreet, and heard that Sophronia was here, and then Ma came to see, oh\r\nsuch a dreadful old stony woman from the country in a turban in Portland\r\nPlace, and I said I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go up with Ma but would drive round and\r\nleave cards for the Boffins, which is taking a liberty with the name;\r\nbut oh my goodness I am distracted, and the phaeton\xe2\x80\x99s at the door, and\r\nwhat would Pa say if he knew it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ye be timid, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98You came in to see us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Georgiana. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very impolite, I know, but\r\nI came to see my poor Sophronia, my only friend. Oh! how I felt the\r\nseparation, my dear Sophronia, before I knew you were brought low in the\r\nworld, and how much more I feel it now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere were actually tears in the bold woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as the soft-headed\r\nand soft-hearted girl twined her arms about her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99ve come on business,\xe2\x80\x99 said Georgiana, sobbing and drying her\r\nface, and then searching in a little reticule, \xe2\x80\x98and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t despatch\r\nit I shall have come for nothing, and oh good gracious! what would Pa\r\nsay if he knew of Sackville Street, and what would Ma say if she was\r\nkept waiting on the doorsteps of that dreadful turban, and there never\r\nwere such pawing horses as ours unsettling my mind every moment more\r\nand more when I want more mind than I have got, by pawing up Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstreet where they have no business to be. Oh! where is, where is it?\r\nOh! I can\xe2\x80\x99t find it!\xe2\x80\x99 All this time sobbing, and searching in the little\r\nreticule.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you miss, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr Boffin, stepping forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! it\xe2\x80\x99s little enough,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Georgiana, \xe2\x80\x98because Ma always treats\r\nme as if I was in the nursery (I am sure I wish I was!), but I hardly\r\never spend it and it has mounted up to fifteen pounds, Sophronia, and I\r\nhope three five-pound notes are better than nothing, though so little,\r\nso little! And now I have found that--oh, my goodness! there\xe2\x80\x99s the other\r\ngone next! Oh no, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, here it is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that, always sobbing and searching in the reticule, Georgiana\r\nproduced a necklace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma says chits and jewels have no business together,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Georgiana,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why I have no trinkets except this, but I suppose\r\nmy aunt Hawkinson was of a different opinion, because she left me this,\r\nthough I used to think she might just as well have buried it, for it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways kept in jewellers\xe2\x80\x99 cotton. However, here it is, I am thankful\r\nto say, and of use at last, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll sell it, dear Sophronia, and buy\r\nthings with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give it to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, gently taking it. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproperly disposed of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! are you such a friend of Sophronia\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Georgiana.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, how good of you! Oh, my gracious! there was something else, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s gone out of my head! Oh no, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, I remember what it was. My\r\ngrandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s property, that\xe2\x80\x99ll come to me when I am of age, Mr Boffin,\r\nwill be all my own, and neither Pa nor Ma nor anybody else will have\r\nany control over it, and what I wish to do it so make some of it over\r\nsomehow to Sophronia and Alfred, by signing something somewhere that\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nprevail on somebody to advance them something. I want them to have\r\nsomething handsome to bring them up in the world again. Oh, my goodness\r\nme! Being such a friend of my dear Sophronia\xe2\x80\x99s, you won\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me,\r\nwill you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98it shall be seen to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, thank you, thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Georgiana. \xe2\x80\x98If my maid had a little\r\nnote and half a crown, I could run round to the pastrycook\xe2\x80\x99s to sign\r\nsomething, or I could sign something in the Square if somebody would\r\ncome and cough for me to let \xe2\x80\x98em in with the key, and would bring a pen\r\nand ink with \xe2\x80\x98em and a bit of blotting-paper. Oh, my gracious! I must\r\ntear myself away, or Pa and Ma will both find out! Dear, dear Sophronia,\r\ngood, good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe credulous little creature again embraced Mrs Lammle most\r\naffectionately, and then held out her hand to Mr Lammle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, dear Mr Lammle--I mean Alfred. You won\xe2\x80\x99t think after to-day\r\nthat I have deserted you and Sophronia because you have been brought low\r\nin the world, will you? Oh me! oh me! I have been crying my eyes out of\r\nmy head, and Ma will be sure to ask me what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter. Oh, take me\r\ndown, somebody, please, please, please!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin took her down, and saw her driven away, with her poor\r\nlittle red eyes and weak chin peering over the great apron of the\r\ncustard-coloured phaeton, as if she had been ordered to expiate some\r\nchildish misdemeanour by going to bed in the daylight, and were peeping\r\nover the counterpane in a miserable flutter of repentance and low\r\nspirits. Returning to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs Lammle still\r\nstanding on her side of the table, and Mr Lammle on his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, showing the money and the necklace,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that these are soon given back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Lammle had taken up her parasol from a side table, and stood\r\nsketching with it on the pattern of the damask cloth, as she had\r\nsketched on the pattern of Mr Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s papered wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not undeceive her I hope, Mr Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, turning her\r\nhead towards him, but not her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, as to the worth and value of her friend,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Lammle explained,\r\nin a measured voice, and with an emphasis on her last word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned. \xe2\x80\x98I may try to give a hint at her home that she is in\r\nwant of kind and careful protection, but I shall say no more than that\r\nto her parents, and I shall say nothing to the young lady herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr and Mrs Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Lammle, still sketching, and seeming to\r\nbestow great pains upon it, \xe2\x80\x98there are not many people, I think, who,\r\nunder the circumstances, would have been so considerate and sparing as\r\nyou have been to me just now. Do you care to be thanked?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks are always worth having,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, in her ready good\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then thank you both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sophronia,\xe2\x80\x99 asked her husband, mockingly, \xe2\x80\x98are you sentimental?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, my good sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin interposed, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good\r\nthing to think well of another person, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very good thing to be\r\nthought well of BY another person. Mrs Lammle will be none the worse for\r\nit, if she is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much obliged. But I asked Mrs Lammle if she was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stood sketching on the table-cloth, with her face clouded and set,\r\nand was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because,\xe2\x80\x99 said Alfred, \xe2\x80\x98I am disposed to be sentimental myself, on\r\nyour appropriation of the jewels and the money, Mr Boffin. As our little\r\nGeorgiana said, three five-pound notes are better than nothing, and if\r\nyou sell a necklace you can buy things with the produce.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98IF you sell it,\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s comment, as he put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\nAlfred followed it with his looks, and also greedily pursued the notes\r\nuntil they vanished into Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat pocket. Then he directed\r\na look, half exasperated and half jeering, at his wife. She still stood\r\nsketching; but, as she sketched, there was a struggle within her, which\r\nfound expression in the depth of the few last lines the parasol point\r\nindented into the table-cloth, and then some tears fell from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, confound the woman,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Lammle, \xe2\x80\x98she IS sentimental!\r\n\r\nShe walked to the window, flinching under his angry stare, looked out\r\nfor a moment, and turned round quite coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have had no former cause of complaint on the sentimental score,\r\nAlfred, and you will have none in future. It is not worth your noticing.\r\nWe go abroad soon, with the money we have earned here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know we do; you know we must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no fear of my taking any sentiment with me. I should soon be\r\neased of it, if I did. But it will be all left behind. It IS all left\r\nbehind. Are you ready, Alfred?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What the deuce have I been waiting for but you, Sophronia?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us go then. I am sorry I have delayed our dignified departure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe passed out and he followed her. Mr and Mrs Boffin had the curiosity\r\nsoftly to raise a window and look after them as they went down the long\r\nstreet. They walked arm-in-arm, showily enough, but without appearing\r\nto interchange a syllable. It might have been fanciful to suppose that\r\nunder their outer bearing there was something of the shamed air of two\r\ncheats who were linked together by concealed handcuffs; but, not so, to\r\nsuppose that they were haggardly weary of one another, of themselves,\r\nand of all this world. In turning the street corner they might have\r\nturned out of this world, for anything Mr and Mrs Boffin ever saw of\r\nthem to the contrary; for, they set eyes on the Lammles never more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN DUSTMAN SINKS AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening of that day being one of the reading evenings at the Bower,\r\nMr Boffin kissed Mrs Boffin after a five o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner, and trotted\r\nout, nursing his big stick in both arms, so that, as of old, it seemed\r\nto be whispering in his ear. He carried so very attentive an expression\r\non his countenance that it appeared as if the confidential discourse of\r\nthe big stick required to be followed closely. Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face was like\r\nthe face of a thoughtful listener to an intricate communication, and, in\r\ntrotting along, he occasionally glanced at that companion with the look\r\nof a man who was interposing the remark: \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin and his stick went on alone together, until they arrived at\r\ncertain cross-ways where they would be likely to fall in with any one\r\ncoming, at about the same time, from Clerkenwell to the Bower. Here they\r\nstopped, and Mr Boffin consulted his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It wants five minutes, good, to Venus\xe2\x80\x99s appointment,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrather early.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Venus was a punctual man, and, even as Mr Boffin replaced his watch\r\nin its pocket, was to be descried coming towards him. He quickened his\r\npace on seeing Mr Boffin already at the place of meeting, and was soon\r\nat his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt would not have been very evident why he thanked the anatomist, but\r\nfor his furnishing the explanation in what he went on to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right, Venus, all right. Now, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see me, and have\r\nconsented to keep up the appearance before Wegg of remaining in it for a\r\ntime, I have got a sort of a backer. All right, Venus. Thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, Venus.\r\nThank\xe2\x80\x99ee, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus shook the proffered hand with a modest air, and they pursued\r\nthe direction of the Bower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think Wegg is likely to drop down upon me to-night, Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninquired Mr Boffin, wistfully, as they went along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think he is, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you any particular reason for thinking so, Venus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned that personage, \xe2\x80\x98the fact is, he has given me\r\nanother look-in, to make sure of what he calls our stock-in-trade being\r\ncorrect, and he has mentioned his intention that he was not to be put\r\noff beginning with you the very next time you should come. And this,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhinted Mr Venus, delicately, \xe2\x80\x98being the very next time, you know, sir--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x98Why, therefore you suppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn to at the grindstone, eh,\r\nWegg?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin took his nose in his hand, as if it were already excoriated,\r\nand the sparks were beginning to fly out of that feature. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nterrible fellow, Venus; he\xe2\x80\x99s an awful fellow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how ever I\r\nshall go through with it. You must stand by me, Venus like a good man\r\nand true. You\xe2\x80\x99ll do all you can to stand by me, Venus; won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus replied with the assurance that he would; and Mr Boffin,\r\nlooking anxious and dispirited, pursued the way in silence until they\r\nrang at the Bower gate. The stumping approach of Wegg was soon heard\r\nbehind it, and as it turned upon its hinges he became visible with his\r\nhand on the lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re quite a stranger!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been otherwise occupied, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you indeed, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the literary gentleman, with a\r\nthreatening sneer. \xe2\x80\x98Hah! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for you, sir, rather what I\r\nmay call specially.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do say so, sir. And if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come round to me tonight, dash\r\nmy wig if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come round to you tomorrow. Now! I tell you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing wrong, I hope, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 was the ironical answer. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing wrong! What should\r\nbe wrong in Boffinses Bower! Step in, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the Bower I\xe2\x80\x99ve shaded for you,\r\n     Your bed shan\xe2\x80\x99t be roses all spangled with doo:\r\n     Will you, will you, will you, will you, come to the Bower?\r\n     Oh, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, come to the\r\n          Bower?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAn unholy glare of contradiction and offence shone in the eyes of Mr\r\nWegg, as he turned the key on his patron, after ushering him into the\r\nyard with this vocal quotation. Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s air was crestfallen and\r\nsubmissive. Whispered Wegg to Venus, as they crossed the yard behind\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98Look at the worm and minion; he\xe2\x80\x99s down in the mouth already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhispered Venus to Wegg: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99ve told him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve prepared\r\nthe way for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, entering the usual chamber, laid his stick upon the settle\r\nusually reserved for him, thrust his hands into his pockets, and,\r\nwith his shoulders raised and his hat drooping back upon them, looking\r\ndisconsolately at Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98My friend and partner, Mr Venus, gives me to\r\nunderstand,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked that man of might, addressing him, \xe2\x80\x98that you are\r\naware of our power over you. Now, when you have took your hat off, we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo into that pint.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin shook it off with one shake, so that it dropped on the floor\r\nbehind him, and remained in his former attitude with his former rueful\r\nlook upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to call you Boffin, for short,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, it\xe2\x80\x99s open to you to lump it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for you, Boffin. Now, do you want to be read to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly care about it to-night, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because if you did want to,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Wegg, the brilliancy of whose\r\npoint was dimmed by his having been unexpectedly answered: \xe2\x80\x98you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been your slave long enough. I\xe2\x80\x99m not to be trampled under-foot\r\nby a dustman any more. With the single exception of the salary, I\r\nrenounce the whole and total sitiwation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since you say it is to be so, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, with folded\r\nhands, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it must be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose it must be,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg retorted. \xe2\x80\x98Next (to clear the ground before\r\ncoming to business), you\xe2\x80\x99ve placed in this yard a skulking, a sneaking,\r\nand a sniffing, menial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a cold in his head when I sent him here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boffin!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98I warn you not to attempt a joke with me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr Venus interposed, and remarked that he conceived Mr Boffin to\r\nhave taken the description literally; the rather, forasmuch as he, Mr\r\nVenus, had himself supposed the menial to have contracted an affliction\r\nor a habit of the nose, involving a serious drawback on the pleasures of\r\nsocial intercourse, until he had discovered that Mr Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s description\r\nof him was to be accepted as merely figurative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anyhow, and every how,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98he has been planted here, and he\r\nis here. Now, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have him here. So I call upon Boffin, before I say\r\nanother word, to fetch him in and send him packing to the right-about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unsuspecting Sloppy was at that moment airing his many buttons\r\nwithin view of the window. Mr Boffin, after a short interval of\r\nimpassive discomfiture, opened the window and beckoned him to come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I call upon Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, with one arm a-kimbo and his head on\r\none side, like a bullying counsel pausing for an answer from a witness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to inform that menial that I am Master here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn humble obedience, when the button-gleaming Sloppy entered Mr Boffin\r\nsaid to him: \xe2\x80\x98Sloppy, my fine fellow, Mr Wegg is Master here. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant you, and you are to go from here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For good!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg severely stipulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nSloppy stared, with both his eyes and all his buttons, and his mouth\r\nwide open; but was without loss of time escorted forth by Silas Wegg,\r\npushed out at the yard gate by the shoulders, and locked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The atomspear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, stumping back into the room again, a\r\nlittle reddened by his late exertion, \xe2\x80\x98is now freer for the purposes of\r\nrespiration. Mr Venus, sir, take a chair. Boffin, you may sit down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, still with his hands ruefully stuck in his pockets, sat on\r\nthe edge of the settle, shrunk into a small compass, and eyed the potent\r\nSilas with conciliatory looks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas Wegg, pointing out Venus, \xe2\x80\x98this gentleman,\r\nBoffin, is more milk and watery with you than I\xe2\x80\x99ll be. But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nborne the Roman yoke as I have, nor yet he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been required to\r\npander to your depraved appetite for miserly characters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never meant, my dear Wegg--\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin was beginning, when Silas\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold your tongue, Boffin! Answer when you\xe2\x80\x99re called upon to answer.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find you\xe2\x80\x99ve got quite enough to do. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re aware--are\r\nyou--that you\xe2\x80\x99re in possession of property to which you\xe2\x80\x99ve no right at\r\nall? Are you aware of that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Venus tells me so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, glancing towards him for any\r\nsupport he could give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Silas. \xe2\x80\x98Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s my hat, Boffin, and here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy walking-stick. Trifle with me, and instead of making a bargain with\r\nyou, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put on my hat and take up my walking-stick, and go out, and\r\nmake a bargain with the rightful owner. Now, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Boffin, leaning forward in alarmed appeal, with his\r\nhands on his knees, \xe2\x80\x98that I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to trifle. Wegg. I have\r\nsaid so to Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You certainly have, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re too milk and watery with our friend, you are indeed,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nremonstrated Silas, with a disapproving shake of his wooden head. \xe2\x80\x98Then\r\nat once you confess yourself desirous to come to terms, do you Boffin?\r\nBefore you answer, keep this hat well in your mind and also this\r\nwalking-stick.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am willing, Wegg, to come to terms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Willing won\xe2\x80\x99t do, Boffin. I won\xe2\x80\x99t take willing. Are you desirous to\r\ncome to terms? Do you ask to be allowed as a favour to come to terms?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Wegg again planted his arm, and put his head on one side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes what?\xe2\x80\x99 said the inexorable Wegg: \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t take yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it\r\nout of you in full, Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried that unfortunate gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98I am so worrited! I ask to\r\nbe allowed to come to terms, supposing your document is all correct.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid of that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas, poking his head at him. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nshall be satisfied by seeing it. Mr Venus will show it you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhold you the while. Then you want to know what the terms are. Is\r\nthat about the sum and substance of it? Will you or won\xe2\x80\x99t you answer,\r\nBoffin?\xe2\x80\x99 For he had paused a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried that unfortunate gentleman again, \xe2\x80\x98I am worrited to\r\nthat degree that I\xe2\x80\x99m almost off my head. You hurry me so. Be so good as\r\nname the terms, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, mark, Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Silas: \xe2\x80\x98Mark \xe2\x80\x98em well, because they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthe lowest terms and the only terms. You\xe2\x80\x99ll throw your Mound (the little\r\nMound as comes to you any way) into the general estate, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndivide the whole property into three parts, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep one and hand\r\nover the others.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s mouth screwed itself up, as Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s face lengthened\r\nitself, Mr Venus not having been prepared for such a rapacious demand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, wait a bit, Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg proceeded, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s something more.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been a squandering this property--laying some of it out on\r\nyourself. THAT won\xe2\x80\x99t do. You\xe2\x80\x99ve bought a house. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be charged for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be ruined, Wegg!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin faintly protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, wait a bit, Boffin; there\xe2\x80\x99s something more. You\xe2\x80\x99ll leave me in\r\nsole custody of these Mounds till they\xe2\x80\x99re all laid low. If any waluables\r\nshould be found in \xe2\x80\x98em, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of such waluables. You\xe2\x80\x99ll produce\r\nyour contract for the sale of the Mounds, that we may know to a penny\r\nwhat they\xe2\x80\x99re worth, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll make out likewise an exact list of\r\nall the other property. When the Mounds is cleared away to the last\r\nshovel-full, the final diwision will come off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful! I shall die in a workhouse!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the\r\nGolden Dustman, with his hands to his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, wait a bit, Boffin; there\xe2\x80\x99s something more. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been unlawfully\r\nferreting about this yard. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been seen in the act of ferreting\r\nabout this yard. Two pair of eyes at the present moment brought to bear\r\nupon you, have seen you dig up a Dutch bottle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was mine, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 protested Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I put it there myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was in it, Boffin?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not gold, not silver, not bank notes, not jewels, nothing that you\r\ncould turn into money, Wegg; upon my soul!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prepared, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, turning to his partner with a knowing\r\nand superior air, \xe2\x80\x98for an ewasive answer on the part of our dusty friend\r\nhere, I have hit out a little idea which I think will meet your views.\r\nWe charge that bottle against our dusty friend at a thousand pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin drew a deep groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, wait a bit, Boffin; there\xe2\x80\x99s something more. In your employment\r\nis an under-handed sneak, named Rokesmith. It won\xe2\x80\x99t answer to have HIM\r\nabout, while this business of ours is about. He must be discharged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rokesmith is already discharged,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, speaking in a muffled\r\nvoice, with his hands before his face, as he rocked himself on the\r\nsettle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Already discharged, is he?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, surprised. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! Then,\r\nBoffin, I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe unlucky gentleman continuing to rock himself to and fro, and to\r\nutter an occasional moan, Mr Venus besought him to bear up against his\r\nreverses, and to take time to accustom himself to the thought of his new\r\nposition. But, his taking time was exactly the thing of all others that\r\nSilas Wegg could not be induced to hear of. \xe2\x80\x98Yes or no, and no half\r\nmeasures!\xe2\x80\x99 was the motto which that obdurate person many times repeated;\r\nshaking his fist at Mr Boffin, and pegging his motto into the floor with\r\nhis wooden leg, in a threatening and alarming manner.\r\n\r\nAt length, Mr Boffin entreated to be allowed a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrace, and a cooling walk of that duration in the yard. With some\r\ndifficulty Mr Wegg granted this great favour, but only on condition\r\nthat he accompanied Mr Boffin in his walk, as not knowing what he might\r\nfraudulently unearth if he were left to himself. A more absurd sight\r\nthan Mr Boffin in his mental irritation trotting very nimbly, and Mr\r\nWegg hopping after him with great exertion, eager to watch the slightest\r\nturn of an eyelash, lest it should indicate a spot rich with some\r\nsecret, assuredly had never been seen in the shadow of the Mounds. Mr\r\nWegg was much distressed when the quarter of an hour expired, and came\r\nhopping in, a very bad second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help myself!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, flouncing on the settle in a\r\nforlorn manner, with his hands deep in his pockets, as if his pockets\r\nhad sunk. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of my pretending to stand out, when I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp myself? I must give in to the terms. But I should like to see the\r\ndocument.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg, who was all for clinching the nail he had so strongly driven home,\r\nannounced that Boffin should see it without an hour\xe2\x80\x99s delay. Taking him\r\ninto custody for that purpose, or overshadowing him as if he really were\r\nhis Evil Genius in visible form, Mr Wegg clapped Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s hat\r\nupon the back of his head, and walked him out by the arm, asserting a\r\nproprietorship over his soul and body that was at once more grim and\r\nmore ridiculous than anything in Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s rare collection. That\r\nlight-haired gentleman followed close upon their heels, at least backing\r\nup Mr Boffin in a literal sense, if he had not had recent opportunities\r\nof doing so spiritually; while Mr Boffin, trotting on as hard as he\r\ncould trot, involved Silas Wegg in frequent collisions with the public,\r\nmuch as a pre-occupied blind man\xe2\x80\x99s dog may be seen to involve his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThus they reached Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, somewhat heated by the\r\nnature of their progress thither. Mr Wegg, especially, was in a flaming\r\nglow, and stood in the little shop, panting and mopping his head with\r\nhis pocket-handkerchief, speechless for several minutes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr Venus, who had left the duelling frogs to fight it out in\r\nhis absence by candlelight for the public delectation, put the shutters\r\nup. When all was snug, and the shop-door fastened, he said to the\r\nperspiring Silas: \xe2\x80\x98I suppose, Mr Wegg, we may now produce the paper?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold on a minute, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied that discreet character; \xe2\x80\x98hold on a\r\nminute. Will you obligingly shove that box--which you mentioned on a\r\nformer occasion as containing miscellanies--towards me in the midst of\r\nthe shop here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus did as he was asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas, looking about: \xe2\x80\x98ve--ry good. Will you hand me\r\nthat chair, sir, to put a-top of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus handed him the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98mount up here and take your seat, will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, as if he were about to have his portrait painted, or to be\r\nelectrified, or to be made a Freemason, or to be placed at any other\r\nsolitary disadvantage, ascended the rostrum prepared for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas, taking off his coat, \xe2\x80\x98when I catches our\r\nfriend here round the arms and body, and pins him tight to the back of\r\nthe chair, you may show him what he wants to see. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll open it and\r\nhold it well up in one hand, sir, and a candle in the other, he can read\r\nit charming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin seemed rather inclined to object to these precautionary\r\narrangements, but, being immediately embraced by Wegg, resigned himself.\r\nVenus then produced the document, and Mr Boffin slowly spelt it out\r\naloud: so very slowly, that Wegg, who was holding him in the chair\r\nwith the grip of a wrestler, became again exceedingly the worse for his\r\nexertions. \xe2\x80\x98Say when you\xe2\x80\x99ve put it safe back, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 he uttered with\r\ndifficulty, \xe2\x80\x98for the strain of this is terrimenjious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt length the document was restored to its place; and Wegg, whose\r\nuncomfortable attitude had been that of a very persevering man\r\nunsuccessfully attempting to stand upon his head, took a seat to recover\r\nhimself. Mr Boffin, for his part, made no attempt to come down, but\r\nremained aloft disconsolate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Boffin!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, as soon as he was in a condition to speak.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, meekly. \xe2\x80\x98Now, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have no doubts about it, Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Wegg. No, Wegg. None,\xe2\x80\x99 was the slow and sad reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, take care, you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98that you stick to your conditions.\r\nMr Venus, if on this auspicious occasion, you should happen to have a\r\ndrop of anything not quite so mild as tea in the \xe2\x80\x98ouse, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d take\r\nthe friendly liberty of asking you for a specimen of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus, reminded of the duties of hospitality, produced some rum.\r\nIn answer to the inquiry, \xe2\x80\x98Will you mix it, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 that gentleman\r\npleasantly rejoined, \xe2\x80\x98I think not, sir. On so auspicious an occasion, I\r\nprefer to take it in the form of a Gum-Tickler.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, declining rum, being still elevated on his pedestal, was in\r\na convenient position to be addressed. Wegg having eyed him with an\r\nimpudent air at leisure, addressed him, therefore, while refreshing\r\nhimself with his dram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bof--fin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, coming out of a fit of abstraction, with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned one thing, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a detail that comes of\r\ncourse. You must be followed up, you know. You must be kept under\r\ninspection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 sneered Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s your wits, Boffin? Till the Mounds\r\nis down and this business completed, you\xe2\x80\x99re accountable for all the\r\nproperty, recollect. Consider yourself accountable to me. Mr Venus here\r\nbeing too milk and watery with you, I am the boy for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a-thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, in a tone of despondency, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nI must keep the knowledge from my old lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The knowledge of the diwision, d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Wegg, helping\r\nhimself to a third Gum-Tickler--for he had already taken a second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. If she was to die first of us two she might then think all her\r\nlife, poor thing, that I had got the rest of the fortune still, and was\r\nsaving it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suspect, Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, shaking his head sagaciously, and\r\nbestowing a wooden wink upon him, \xe2\x80\x98that you\xe2\x80\x99ve found out some account\r\nof some old chap, supposed to be a Miser, who got himself the credit of\r\nhaving much more money than he had. However, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin feelingly represented to him: \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see? My old lady has got so used to the property. It would be such a\r\nhard surprise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it at all,\xe2\x80\x99 blustered Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll have as much as I\r\nshall. And who are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But then, again,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin gently represented; \xe2\x80\x98my old lady has very\r\nupright principles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s your old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98to set herself up for having\r\nuprighter principles than mine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin seemed a little less patient at this point than at any other\r\nof the negotiations. But he commanded himself, and said tamely enough:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it must be kept from my old lady, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, contemptuously, though, perhaps, perceiving some hint\r\nof danger otherwise, \xe2\x80\x98keep it from your old lady. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell\r\nher. I can have you under close inspection without that. I\xe2\x80\x99m as good a\r\nman as you, and better. Ask me to dinner. Give me the run of your \xe2\x80\x98ouse.\r\nI was good enough for you and your old lady once, when I helped you out\r\nwith your weal and hammers. Was there no Miss Elizabeth, Master George,\r\nAunt Jane, and Uncle Parker, before YOU two?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gently, Mr Wegg, gently,\xe2\x80\x99 Venus urged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Milk and water-erily you mean, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, with some little\r\nthickness of speech, in consequence of the Gum-Ticklers having tickled\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him under inspection, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll inspect him.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAlong the line the signal ran\r\n     England expects as this present man\r\n     Will keep Boffin to his duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n--Boffin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin descended with an air of resignation, and gave himself up,\r\nafter taking friendly leave of Mr Venus. Once more, Inspector and\r\nInspected went through the streets together, and so arrived at Mr\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nBut even there, when Mr Boffin had given his keeper good-night, and had\r\nlet himself in with his key, and had softly closed the door, even there\r\nand then, the all-powerful Silas must needs claim another assertion of\r\nhis newly-asserted power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bof--fin!\xe2\x80\x99 he called through the keyhole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply through the same channel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come out. Show yourself again. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have another look at you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Boffin--ah, how fallen from the high estate of his honest\r\nsimplicity!--opened the door and obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go in. You may get to bed now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, with a grin.\r\n\r\nThe door was hardly closed, when he again called through the keyhole:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bof--fin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis time Silas made no reply, but laboured with a will at turning an\r\nimaginary grindstone outside the keyhole, while Mr Boffin stooped at it\r\nwithin; he then laughed silently, and stumped home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nA RUNAWAY MATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nCherubic Pa arose with as little noise as possible from beside majestic\r\nMa, one morning early, having a holiday before him. Pa and the lovely\r\nwoman had a rather particular appointment to keep.\r\n\r\nYet Pa and the lovely woman were not going out together. Bella was up\r\nbefore four, but had no bonnet on. She was waiting at the foot of the\r\nstairs--was sitting on the bottom stair, in fact--to receive Pa when he\r\ncame down, but her only object seemed to be to get Pa well out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your breakfast is ready, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Bella, after greeting him with\r\na hug, \xe2\x80\x98and all you have to do, is, to eat it up and drink it up, and\r\nescape. How do you feel, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the best of my judgement, like a housebreaker new to the business,\r\nmy dear, who can\xe2\x80\x99t make himself quite comfortable till he is off the\r\npremises.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella tucked her arm in his with a merry noiseless laugh, and they went\r\ndown to the kitchen on tiptoe; she stopping on every separate stair to\r\nput the tip of her forefinger on her rosy lips, and then lay it on his\r\nlips, according to her favourite petting way of kissing Pa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do YOU feel, my love?\xe2\x80\x99 asked R. W., as she gave him his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel as if the Fortune-teller was coming true, dear Pa, and the fair\r\nlittle man was turning out as was predicted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ho! Only the fair little man?\xe2\x80\x99 said her father.\r\n\r\nBella put another of those finger-seals upon his lips, and then said,\r\nkneeling down by him as he sat at table: \xe2\x80\x98Now, look here, sir. If you\r\nkeep well up to the mark this day, what do you think you deserve?\r\nWhat did I promise you should have, if you were good, upon a certain\r\noccasion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, Precious. Yes, I do, though. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit one of these beau--tiful tresses?\xe2\x80\x99 with his caressing hand upon her\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it, too!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, pretending to pout. \xe2\x80\x98Upon my word! Do\r\nyou know, sir, that the Fortune-teller would give five thousand guineas\r\n(if it was quite convenient to him, which it isn\xe2\x80\x99t) for the lovely piece\r\nI have cut off for you? You can form no idea, sir, of the number of\r\ntimes he kissed quite a scrubby little piece--in comparison--that I cut\r\noff for HIM. And he wears it, too, round his neck, I can tell you! Near\r\nhis heart!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, nodding. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! very near his heart! However, you\r\nhave been a good, good boy, and you are the best of all the dearest boys\r\nthat ever were, this morning, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the chain I have made of\r\nit, Pa, and you must let me put it round your neck with my own loving\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Pa bent his head, she cried over him a little, and then said (after\r\nhaving stopped to dry her eyes on his white waistcoat, the discovery of\r\nwhich incongruous circumstance made her laugh): \xe2\x80\x98Now, darling Pa,\r\ngive me your hands that I may fold them together, and do you say after\r\nme:--My little Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My little Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Pa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very fond of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very fond of you, my darling,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything not dictated to you, sir. You daren\xe2\x80\x99t do it in\r\nyour responses at Church, and you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do it in your responses out of\r\nChurch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I withdraw the darling,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a pious boy! Now again:--You were always--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You were always,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Pa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A vexatious--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No you weren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Pa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A vexatious (do you hear, sir?), a vexatious, capricious, thankless,\r\ntroublesome, Animal; but I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll do better in the time to come,\r\nand I bless you and forgive you!\xe2\x80\x99 Here, she quite forgot that it was\r\nPa\xe2\x80\x99s turn to make the responses, and clung to his neck. \xe2\x80\x98Dear Pa, if you\r\nknew how much I think this morning of what you told me once, about the\r\nfirst time of our seeing old Mr Harmon, when I stamped and screamed\r\nand beat you with my detestable little bonnet! I feel as if I had been\r\nstamping and screaming and beating you with my hateful little bonnet,\r\never since I was born, darling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, my love. And as to your bonnets, they have always been nice\r\nbonnets, for they have always become you--or you have become them;\r\nperhaps it was that--at every age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I hurt you much, poor little Pa?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, laughing\r\n(notwithstanding her repentance), with fantastic pleasure in the\r\npicture, \xe2\x80\x98when I beat you with my bonnet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my child. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have hurt a fly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, but I am afraid I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have beat you at all, unless I had\r\nmeant to hurt you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98Did I pinch your legs, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much, my dear; but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s almost time I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella. \xe2\x80\x98If I go on chattering, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be taken alive.\r\nFly, Pa, fly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, they went softly up the kitchen stairs on tiptoe, and Bella with\r\nher light hand softly removed the fastenings of the house door, and Pa,\r\nhaving received a parting hug, made off. When he had gone a little way,\r\nhe looked back. Upon which, Bella set another of those finger seals upon\r\nthe air, and thrust out her little foot expressive of the mark. Pa, in\r\nappropriate action, expressed fidelity to the mark, and made off as fast\r\nas he could go.\r\n\r\nBella walked thoughtfully in the garden for an hour and more, and then,\r\nreturning to the bedroom where Lavvy the Irrepressible still slumbered,\r\nput on a little bonnet of quiet, but on the whole of sly appearance,\r\nwhich she had yesterday made. \xe2\x80\x98I am going for a walk, Lavvy,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\nas she stooped down and kissed her. The Irrepressible, with a bounce in\r\nthe bed, and a remark that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t time to get up yet, relapsed into\r\nunconsciousness, if she had come out of it.\r\n\r\nBehold Bella tripping along the streets, the dearest girl afoot under\r\nthe summer sun! Behold Pa waiting for Bella behind a pump, at least\r\nthree miles from the parental roof-tree. Behold Bella and Pa aboard an\r\nearly steamboat for Greenwich.\r\n\r\nWere they expected at Greenwich? Probably. At least, Mr John Rokesmith\r\nwas on the pier looking out, about a couple of hours before the coaly\r\n(but to him gold-dusty) little steamboat got her steam up in London.\r\nProbably. At least, Mr John Rokesmith seemed perfectly satisfied when\r\nhe descried them on board. Probably. At least, Bella no sooner stepped\r\nashore than she took Mr John Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s arm, without evincing surprise,\r\nand the two walked away together with an ethereal air of happiness\r\nwhich, as it were, wafted up from the earth and drew after them a gruff\r\nand glum old pensioner to see it out. Two wooden legs had this gruff and\r\nglum old pensioner, and, a minute before Bella stepped out of the boat,\r\nand drew that confiding little arm of hers through Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s, he had\r\nhad no object in life but tobacco, and not enough of that. Stranded was\r\nGruff and Glum in a harbour of everlasting mud, when all in an instant\r\nBella floated him, and away he went.\r\n\r\nSay, cherubic parent taking the lead, in what direction do we steer\r\nfirst? With some such inquiry in his thoughts, Gruff and Glum, stricken\r\nby so sudden an interest that he perked his neck and looked over the\r\nintervening people, as if he were trying to stand on tiptoe with his two\r\nwooden legs, took an observation of R. W. There was no \xe2\x80\x98first\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\ncase, Gruff and Glum made out; the cherubic parent was bearing down and\r\ncrowding on direct for Greenwich church, to see his relations.\r\n\r\nFor, Gruff and Glum, though most events acted on him simply as\r\ntobacco-stoppers, pressing down and condensing the quids within him,\r\nmight be imagined to trace a family resemblance between the cherubs in\r\nthe church architecture, and the cherub in the white waistcoat. Some\r\nremembrance of old Valentines, wherein a cherub, less appropriately\r\nattired for a proverbially uncertain climate, had been seen conducting\r\nlovers to the altar, might have been fancied to inflame the ardour of\r\nhis timber toes. Be it as it might, he gave his moorings the slip, and\r\nfollowed in chase.\r\n\r\nThe cherub went before, all beaming smiles; Bella and John Rokesmith\r\nfollowed; Gruff and Glum stuck to them like wax. For years, the wings\r\nof his mind had gone to look after the legs of his body; but Bella had\r\nbrought them back for him per steamer, and they were spread again.\r\n\r\nHe was a slow sailer on a wind of happiness, but he took a cross cut\r\nfor the rendezvous, and pegged away as if he were scoring furiously\r\nat cribbage. When the shadow of the church-porch swallowed them up,\r\nvictorious Gruff and Glum likewise presented himself to be swallowed up.\r\nAnd by this time the cherubic parent was so fearful of surprise, that,\r\nbut for the two wooden legs on which Gruff and Glum was reassuringly\r\nmounted, his conscience might have introduced, in the person of that\r\npensioner, his own stately lady disguised, arrived at Greenwich in a\r\ncar and griffins, like the spiteful Fairy at the christenings of the\r\nPrincesses, to do something dreadful to the marriage service. And truly\r\nhe had a momentary reason to be pale of face, and to whisper to Bella,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think that can be your Ma; do you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 on account of\r\na mysterious rustling and a stealthy movement somewhere in the remote\r\nneighbourhood of the organ, though it was gone directly and was heard no\r\nmore. Albeit it was heard of afterwards, as will afterwards be read in\r\nthis veracious register of marriage.\r\n\r\nWho taketh? I, John, and so do I, Bella. Who giveth? I, R. W. Forasmuch,\r\nGruff and Glum, as John and Bella have consented together in holy\r\nwedlock, you may (in short) consider it done, and withdraw your two\r\nwooden legs from this temple. To the foregoing purport, the Minister\r\nspeaking, as directed by the Rubric, to the People, selectly represented\r\nin the present instance by G. and G. above mentioned.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the church-porch having swallowed up Bella Wilfer for ever and\r\never, had it not in its power to relinquish that young woman, but slid\r\ninto the happy sunlight, Mrs John Rokesmith instead. And long on the\r\nbright steps stood Gruff and Glum, looking after the pretty bride, with\r\na narcotic consciousness of having dreamed a dream.\r\n\r\nAfter which, Bella took out from her pocket a little letter, and read it\r\naloud to Pa and John; this being a true copy of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAREST MA,\r\n\r\nI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, but I am most happily married to Mr John\r\nRokesmith, who loves me better than I can ever deserve, except by loving\r\nhim with all my heart. I thought it best not to mention it beforehand,\r\nin case it should cause any little difference at home. Please tell\r\ndarling Pa. With love to Lavvy,\r\n\r\nEver dearest Ma, Your affectionate daughter, BELLA (P.S.--Rokesmith).\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, John Rokesmith put the queen\xe2\x80\x99s countenance on the letter--when had\r\nHer Gracious Majesty looked so benign as on that blessed morning!--and\r\nthen Bella popped it into the post-office, and said merrily, \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\ndearest Pa, you are safe, and will never be taken alive!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPa was, at first, in the stirred depths of his conscience, so far from\r\nsure of being safe yet, that he made out majestic matrons lurking in\r\nambush among the harmless trees of Greenwich Park, and seemed to see a\r\nstately countenance tied up in a well-known pocket-handkerchief glooming\r\ndown at him from a window of the Observatory, where the Familiars of the\r\nAstronomer Royal nightly outwatch the winking stars. But, the minutes\r\npassing on and no Mrs Wilfer in the flesh appearing, he became more\r\nconfident, and so repaired with good heart and appetite to Mr and Mrs\r\nJohn Rokesmith\xe2\x80\x99s cottage on Blackheath, where breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\nA modest little cottage but a bright and a fresh, and on the snowy\r\ntablecloth the prettiest of little breakfasts. In waiting, too, like\r\nan attendant summer breeze, a fluttering young damsel, all pink and\r\nribbons, blushing as if she had been married instead of Bella, and yet\r\nasserting the triumph of her sex over both John and Pa, in an exulting\r\nand exalted flurry: as who should say, \xe2\x80\x98This is what you must all come\r\nto, gentlemen, when we choose to bring you to book.\xe2\x80\x99 This same young\r\ndamsel was Bella\xe2\x80\x99s serving-maid, and unto her did deliver a bunch of\r\nkeys, commanding treasures in the way of dry-saltery, groceries, jams\r\nand pickles, the investigation of which made pastime after breakfast,\r\nwhen Bella declared that \xe2\x80\x98Pa must taste everything, John dear, or it\r\nwill never be lucky,\xe2\x80\x99 and when Pa had all sorts of things poked into\r\nhis mouth, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what to do with them when they were put\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThen they, all three, out for a charming ride, and for a charming stroll\r\namong heath in bloom, and there behold the identical Gruff and Glum with\r\nhis wooden legs horizontally disposed before him, apparently sitting\r\nmeditating on the vicissitudes of life! To whom said Bella, in her\r\nlight-hearted surprise: \xe2\x80\x98Oh! How do you do again? What a dear old\r\npensioner you are!\xe2\x80\x99 To which Gruff and Glum responded that he see her\r\nmarried this morning, my Beauty, and that if it warn\xe2\x80\x99t a liberty he\r\nwished her ji and the fairest of fair wind and weather; further, in a\r\ngeneral way requesting to know what cheer? and scrambling up on his two\r\nwooden legs to salute, hat in hand, ship-shape, with the gallantry of a\r\nman-of-warsman and a heart of oak.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant sight, in the midst of the golden bloom, to see this\r\nsalt old Gruff and Glum, waving his shovel hat at Bella, while his thin\r\nwhite hair flowed free, as if she had once more launched him into blue\r\nwater again. \xe2\x80\x98You are a charming old pensioner,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98and I am\r\nso happy that I wish I could make you happy, too.\xe2\x80\x99 Answered Gruff and\r\nGlum, \xe2\x80\x98Give me leave to kiss your hand, my Lovely, and it\xe2\x80\x99s done!\xe2\x80\x99 So it\r\nwas done to the general contentment; and if Gruff and Glum didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\ncourse of the afternoon splice the main brace, it was not for want of\r\nthe means of inflicting that outrage on the feelings of the Infant Bands\r\nof Hope.\r\n\r\nBut, the marriage dinner was the crowning success, for what had bride\r\nand bridegroom plotted to do, but to have and to hold that dinner in the\r\nvery room of the very hotel where Pa and the lovely woman had once dined\r\ntogether! Bella sat between Pa and John, and divided her attentions\r\npretty equally, but felt it necessary (in the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s absence before\r\ndinner) to remind Pa that she was HIS lovely woman no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am well aware of it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the cherub, \xe2\x80\x98and I resign you\r\nwillingly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Willingly, sir? You ought to be brokenhearted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I should be, my dear, if I thought that I was going to lose you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you know you are not; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, poor dear Pa? You know that you\r\nhave only made a new relation who will be as fond of you and as thankful\r\nto you--for my sake and your own sake both--as I am; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear\r\nlittle Pa? Look here, Pa!\xe2\x80\x99 Bella put her finger on her own lip, and then\r\non Pa\xe2\x80\x99s, and then on her own lip again, and then on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nwe are a partnership of three, dear Pa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe appearance of dinner here cut Bella short in one of her\r\ndisappearances: the more effectually, because it was put on under the\r\nauspices of a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a white cravat, who\r\nlooked much more like a clergyman than THE clergyman, and seemed to\r\nhave mounted a great deal higher in the church: not to say, scaled the\r\nsteeple. This dignitary, conferring in secrecy with John Rokesmith on\r\nthe subject of punch and wines, bent his head as though stooping to\r\nthe Papistical practice of receiving auricular confession. Likewise,\r\non John\xe2\x80\x99s offering a suggestion which didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet his views, his face\r\nbecame overcast and reproachful, as enjoining penance.\r\n\r\nWhat a dinner! Specimens of all the fishes that swim in the sea, surely\r\nhad swum their way to it, and if samples of the fishes of divers\r\ncolours that made a speech in the Arabian Nights (quite a ministerial\r\nexplanation in respect of cloudiness), and then jumped out of the\r\nfrying-pan, were not to be recognized, it was only because they had all\r\nbecome of one hue by being cooked in batter among the whitebait. And the\r\ndishes being seasoned with Bliss--an article which they are sometimes\r\nout of, at Greenwich--were of perfect flavour, and the golden drinks\r\nhad been bottled in the golden age and hoarding up their sparkles ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe best of it was, that Bella and John and the cherub had made a\r\ncovenant that they would not reveal to mortal eyes any appearance\r\nwhatever of being a wedding party. Now, the supervising dignitary, the\r\nArchbishop of Greenwich, knew this as well as if he had performed the\r\nnuptial ceremony. And the loftiness with which his Grace entered into\r\ntheir confidence without being invited, and insisted on a show\r\nof keeping the waiters out of it, was the crowning glory of the\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nThere was an innocent young waiter of a slender form and with weakish\r\nlegs, as yet unversed in the wiles of waiterhood, and but too evidently\r\nof a romantic temperament, and deeply (it were not too much to add\r\nhopelessly) in love with some young female not aware of his merit.\r\nThis guileless youth, descrying the position of affairs, which even\r\nhis innocence could not mistake, limited his waiting to languishing\r\nadmiringly against the sideboard when Bella didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything, and\r\nswooping at her when she did. Him, his Grace the Archbishop perpetually\r\nobstructed, cutting him out with his elbow in the moment of success,\r\ndespatching him in degrading quest of melted butter, and, when by any\r\nchance he got hold of any dish worth having, bereaving him of it, and\r\nordering him to stand back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray excuse him, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Archbishop in a low stately voice;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he is a very young man on liking, and we DON\xe2\x80\x99T like him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis induced John Rokesmith to observe--by way of making the thing more\r\nnatural--\xe2\x80\x98Bella, my love, this is so much more successful than any\r\nof our past anniversaries, that I think we must keep our future\r\nanniversaries here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhereunto Bella replied, with probably the least successful attempt at\r\nlooking matronly that ever was seen: \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, I think so, John, dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere the Archbishop of Greenwich coughed a stately cough to attract the\r\nattention of three of his ministers present, and staring at them, seemed\r\nto say: \xe2\x80\x98I call upon you by your fealty to believe this!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith his own hands he afterwards put on the dessert, as remarking to the\r\nthree guests, \xe2\x80\x98The period has now arrived at which we can dispense with\r\nthe assistance of those fellows who are not in our confidence,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwould have retired with complete dignity but for a daring action issuing\r\nfrom the misguided brain of the young man on liking. He finding, by\r\nill-fortune, a piece of orange flower somewhere in the lobbies now\r\napproached undetected with the same in a finger-glass, and placed it on\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s right hand. The Archbishop instantly ejected and excommunicated\r\nhim; but the thing was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I trust, madam,\xe2\x80\x99 said his Grace, returning alone, \xe2\x80\x98that you will have\r\nthe kindness to overlook it, in consideration of its being the act of a\r\nvery young man who is merely here on liking, and who will never answer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that, he solemnly bowed and retired, and they all burst into\r\nlaughter, long and merry. \xe2\x80\x98Disguise is of no use,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98they\r\nall find me out; I think it must be, Pa and John dear, because I look so\r\nhappy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer husband feeling it necessary at this point to demand one of those\r\nmysterious disappearances on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s part, she dutifully obeyed; saying\r\nin a softened voice from her place of concealment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember how we talked about the ships that day, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange, now, to think that there was no John in all the\r\nships, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Pa! Not at all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear. How can we tell what coming people are aboard the ships\r\nthat may be sailing to us now from the unknown seas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella remaining invisible and silent, her father remained at his\r\ndessert and wine, until he remembered it was time for him to get home to\r\nHolloway. \xe2\x80\x98Though I positively cannot tear myself away,\xe2\x80\x99 he cherubically\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98--it would be a sin--without drinking to many, many happy\r\nreturns of this most happy day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here! ten thousand times!\xe2\x80\x99 cried John. \xe2\x80\x98I fill my glass and my precious\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub, inaudibly addressing, in his Anglo-Saxon\r\ntendency to throw his feelings into the form of a speech, the boys down\r\nbelow, who were bidding against each other to put their heads in the mud\r\nfor sixpence: \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen--and Bella and John--you will readily suppose\r\nthat it is not my intention to trouble you with many observations on the\r\npresent occasion. You will also at once infer the nature and even\r\nthe terms of the toast I am about to propose on the present occasion.\r\nGentlemen--and Bella and John--the present occasion is an occasion\r\nfraught with feelings that I cannot trust myself to express. But\r\ngentlemen--and Bella and John--for the part I have had in it, for the\r\nconfidence you have placed in me, and for the affectionate good-nature\r\nand kindness with which you have determined not to find me in the way,\r\nwhen I am well aware that I cannot be otherwise than in it more or less,\r\nI do most heartily thank you. Gentlemen--and Bella and John--my love\r\nto you, and may we meet, as on the present occasion, on many future\r\noccasions; that is to say, gentlemen--and Bella and John--on many happy\r\nreturns of the present happy occasion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving thus concluded his address, the amiable cherub embraced his\r\ndaughter, and took his flight to the steamboat which was to convey him\r\nto London, and was then lying at the floating pier, doing its best to\r\nbump the same to bits. But, the happy couple were not going to part with\r\nhim in that way, and before he had been on board two minutes, there they\r\nwere, looking down at him from the wharf above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pa, dear!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, beckoning him with her parasol to approach the\r\nside, and bending gracefully to whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my darling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I beat you much with that horrid little bonnet, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing to speak of; my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I pinch your legs, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only nicely, my pet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure you quite forgive me, Pa? Please, Pa, please, forgive me\r\nquite!\xe2\x80\x99 Half laughing at him and half crying to him, Bella besought him\r\nin the prettiest manner; in a manner so engaging and so playful and\r\nso natural, that her cherubic parent made a coaxing face as if she had\r\nnever grown up, and said, \xe2\x80\x98What a silly little Mouse it is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you do forgive me that, and everything else; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dearest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel solitary or neglected, going away by yourself; do\r\nyou, Pa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord bless you! No, my Life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, dearest Pa. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, my darling! Take her away, my dear John. Take her home!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo, she leaning on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arm, they turned homeward by a rosy\r\npath which the gracious sun struck out for them in its setting. And O\r\nthere are days in this life, worth life and worth death. And O what a\r\nbright old song it is, that O \xe2\x80\x98tis love, \xe2\x80\x98tis love, \xe2\x80\x98tis love that makes\r\nthe world go round!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE MENDICANT\xe2\x80\x99S BRIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impressive gloom with which Mrs Wilfer received her husband on his\r\nreturn from the wedding, knocked so hard at the door of the cherubic\r\nconscience, and likewise so impaired the firmness of the cherubic legs,\r\nthat the culprit\xe2\x80\x99s tottering condition of mind and body might have\r\nroused suspicion in less occupied persons that the grimly heroic lady,\r\nMiss Lavinia, and that esteemed friend of the family, Mr George Sampson.\r\nBut, the attention of all three being fully possessed by the main\r\nfact of the marriage, they had happily none to bestow on the guilty\r\nconspirator; to which fortunate circumstance he owed the escape for\r\nwhich he was in nowise indebted to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not, R. W.\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer from her stately corner, \xe2\x80\x98inquire\r\nfor your daughter Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, with a most flagrant assumption of\r\nunconsciousness, \xe2\x80\x98I did omit it. How--or perhaps I should rather say\r\nwhere--IS Bella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not here,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Wilfer proclaimed, with folded arms.\r\n\r\nThe cherub faintly muttered something to the abortive effect of \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nindeed, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not here,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Wilfer, in a stern sonorous voice. \xe2\x80\x98In a word,\r\nR. W., you have no daughter Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No daughter Bella, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Your daughter Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, with a lofty air of never\r\nhaving had the least copartnership in that young lady: of whom she now\r\nmade reproachful mention as an article of luxury which her husband had\r\nset up entirely on his own account, and in direct opposition to her\r\nadvice: \xe2\x80\x98--your daughter Bella has bestowed herself upon a Mendicant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good gracious, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Show your father his daughter Bella\xe2\x80\x99s letter, Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs\r\nWilfer, in her monotonous Act of Parliament tone, and waving her hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think your father will admit it to be documentary proof of what I\r\ntell him. I believe your father is acquainted with his daughter Bella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting. But I do not know. He may tell you he is not. Nothing will\r\nsurprise me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Posted at Greenwich, and dated this morning,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Irrepressible,\r\nflouncing at her father in handing him the evidence. \xe2\x80\x98Hopes Ma won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nangry, but is happily married to Mr John Rokesmith, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention\r\nit beforehand to avoid words, and please tell darling you, and love\r\nto me, and I should like to know what you\xe2\x80\x99d have said if any other\r\nunmarried member of the family had done it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe read the letter, and faintly exclaimed \xe2\x80\x98Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may well say Dear me!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Mrs Wilfer, in a deep tone. Upon\r\nwhich encouragement he said it again, though scarcely with the success\r\nhe had expected; for the scornful lady then remarked, with extreme\r\nbitterness: \xe2\x80\x98You said that before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very surprising. But I suppose, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 hinted the cherub, as he\r\nfolded the letter after a disconcerting silence, \xe2\x80\x98that we must make the\r\nbest of it? Would you object to my pointing out, my dear, that Mr\r\nJohn Rokesmith is not (so far as I am acquainted with him), strictly\r\nspeaking, a Mendicant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Wilfer, with an awful air of politeness. \xe2\x80\x98Truly\r\nso? I was not aware that Mr John Rokesmith was a gentleman of landed\r\nproperty. But I am much relieved to hear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I doubt if you HAVE heard it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 the cherub submitted with\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98I make false statements, it appears? So\r\nbe it. If my daughter flies in my face, surely my husband may. The one\r\nthing is not more unnatural than the other. There seems a fitness in the\r\narrangement. By all means!\xe2\x80\x99 Assuming, with a shiver of resignation, a\r\ndeadly cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nBut, here the Irrepressible skirmished into the conflict, dragging the\r\nreluctant form of Mr Sampson after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed the young lady, \xe2\x80\x98I must say I think it would be much\r\nbetter if you would keep to the point, and not hold forth about\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s flying into people\xe2\x80\x99s faces, which is nothing more nor less than\r\nimpossible nonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Wilfer, knitting her dark brows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just im-possible nonsense, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavvy, \xe2\x80\x98and George Sampson\r\nknows it is, as well as I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer suddenly becoming petrified, fixed her indignant eyes upon\r\nthe wretched George: who, divided between the support due from him to\r\nhis love, and the support due from him to his love\xe2\x80\x99s mamma, supported\r\nnobody, not even himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The true point is,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Lavinia, \xe2\x80\x98that Bella has behaved in a most\r\nunsisterly way to me, and might have severely compromised me with George\r\nand with George\xe2\x80\x99s family, by making off and getting married in this very\r\nlow and disreputable manner--with some pew-opener or other, I suppose,\r\nfor a bridesmaid--when she ought to have confided in me, and ought\r\nto have said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf, Lavvy, you consider it due to your engagement with\r\nGeorge, that you should countenance the occasion by being present, then\r\nLavvy, I beg you to BE present, keeping my secret from Ma and Pa.\xe2\x80\x9d As of\r\ncourse I should have done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As of course you would have done? Ingrate!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Wilfer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Viper!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say! You know ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Upon my honour you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sampson\r\nremonstrated, shaking his head seriously, \xe2\x80\x98With the highest respect for\r\nyou, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, upon my life you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. No really, you know. When a man\r\nwith the feelings of a gentleman finds himself engaged to a young lady,\r\nand it comes (even on the part of a member of the family) to vipers, you\r\nknow!--I would merely put it to your own good feeling, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr Sampson, in rather lame conclusion.\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s baleful stare at the young gentleman in acknowledgment of\r\nhis obliging interference was of such a nature that Miss Lavinia burst\r\ninto tears, and caught him round the neck for his protection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own unnatural mother,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the young lady, \xe2\x80\x98wants to annihilate\r\nGeorge! But you shan\xe2\x80\x99t be annihilated, George. I\xe2\x80\x99ll die first!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson, in the arms of his mistress, still struggled to shake his\r\nhead at Mrs Wilfer, and to remark: \xe2\x80\x98With every sentiment of respect for\r\nyou, you know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--vipers really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do you credit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall not be annihilated, George!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Lavinia. \xe2\x80\x98Ma shall\r\ndestroy me first, and then she\xe2\x80\x99ll be contented. Oh, oh, oh! Have I lured\r\nGeorge from his happy home to expose him to this! George, dear, be free!\r\nLeave me, ever dearest George, to Ma and to my fate. Give my love to\r\nyour aunt, George dear, and implore her not to curse the viper that has\r\ncrossed your path and blighted your existence. Oh, oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x99 The young\r\nlady who, hysterically speaking, was only just come of age, and had\r\nnever gone off yet, here fell into a highly creditable crisis, which,\r\nregarded as a first performance, was very successful; Mr Sampson,\r\nbending over the body meanwhile, in a state of distraction, which\r\ninduced him to address Mrs Wilfer in the inconsistent expressions:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Demon--with the highest respect for you--behold your work!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cherub stood helplessly rubbing his chin and looking on, but on the\r\nwhole was inclined to welcome this diversion as one in which, by reason\r\nof the absorbent properties of hysterics, the previous question would\r\nbecome absorbed. And so, indeed, it proved, for the Irrepressible\r\ngradually coming to herself; and asking with wild emotion, \xe2\x80\x98George dear,\r\nare you safe?\xe2\x80\x99 and further, \xe2\x80\x98George love, what has happened? Where is\r\nMa?\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sampson, with words of comfort, raised her prostrate form, and\r\nhanded her to Mrs Wilfer as if the young lady were something in the\r\nnature of refreshments. Mrs Wilfer with dignity partaking of the\r\nrefreshments, by kissing her once on the brow (as if accepting an\r\noyster), Miss Lavvy, tottering, returned to the protection of Mr\r\nSampson; to whom she said, \xe2\x80\x98George dear, I am afraid I have been\r\nfoolish; but I am still a little weak and giddy; don\xe2\x80\x99t let go my hand,\r\nGeorge!\xe2\x80\x99 And whom she afterwards greatly agitated at intervals, by\r\ngiving utterance, when least expected, to a sound between a sob and a\r\nbottle of soda water, that seemed to rend the bosom of her frock.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable effects of this crisis may be mentioned its\r\nhaving, when peace was restored, an inexplicable moral influence, of an\r\nelevating kind, on Miss Lavinia, Mrs Wilfer, and Mr George Sampson, from\r\nwhich R. W. was altogether excluded, as an outsider and non-sympathizer.\r\nMiss Lavinia assumed a modest air of having distinguished herself; Mrs\r\nWilfer, a serene air of forgiveness and resignation; Mr Sampson, an air\r\nof having been improved and chastened. The influence pervaded the spirit\r\nin which they returned to the previous question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy, with a melancholy smile, \xe2\x80\x98after what has\r\npassed, I am sure Ma will tell Pa that he may tell Bella we shall all be\r\nglad to see her and her husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson said he was sure of it too; murmuring how eminently he\r\nrespected Mrs Wilfer, and ever must, and ever would. Never more\r\neminently, he added, than after what had passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Far be it from me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, making deep proclamation from her\r\ncorner, \xe2\x80\x98to run counter to the feelings of a child of mine, and of a\r\nYouth,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sampson hardly seemed to like that word, \xe2\x80\x98who is the object\r\nof her maiden preference. I may feel--nay, know--that I have been\r\ndeluded and deceived. I may feel--nay, know--that I have been set\r\naside and passed over. I may feel--nay, know--that after having so far\r\novercome my repugnance towards Mr and Mrs Boffin as to receive them\r\nunder this roof, and to consent to your daughter Bella\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 here turning\r\nto her husband, \xe2\x80\x98residing under theirs, it were well if your daughter\r\nBella,\xe2\x80\x99 again turning to her husband, \xe2\x80\x98had profited in a worldly\r\npoint of view by a connection so distasteful, so disreputable. I may\r\nfeel--nay, know--that in uniting herself to Mr Rokesmith she has united\r\nherself to one who is, in spite of shallow sophistry, a Mendicant. And\r\nI may feel well assured that your daughter Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 again turning to her\r\nhusband, \xe2\x80\x98does not exalt her family by becoming a Mendicant\xe2\x80\x99s bride. But\r\nI suppress what I feel, and say nothing of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson murmured that this was the sort of thing you might expect\r\nfrom one who had ever in her own family been an example and never\r\nan outrage. And ever more so (Mr Sampson added, with some degree of\r\nobscurity,) and never more so, than in and through what had passed. He\r\nmust take the liberty of adding, that what was true of the mother\r\nwas true of the youngest daughter, and that he could never forget the\r\ntouching feelings that the conduct of both had awakened within him. In\r\nconclusion, he did hope that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a man with a beating heart who\r\nwas capable of something that remained undescribed, in consequence of\r\nMiss Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s stopping him as he reeled in his speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Therefore, R. W.\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, resuming her discourse and turning\r\nto her lord again, \xe2\x80\x98let your daughter Bella come when she will, and she\r\nwill be received. So,\xe2\x80\x99 after a short pause, and an air of having taken\r\nmedicine in it, \xe2\x80\x98so will her husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I beg, Pa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia, \xe2\x80\x98that you will not tell Bella what I\r\nhave undergone. It can do no good, and it might cause her to reproach\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dearest girl,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Sampson, \xe2\x80\x98she ought to know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, George,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavinia, in a tone of resolute self-denial. \xe2\x80\x98No,\r\ndearest George, let it be buried in oblivion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson considered that, \xe2\x80\x98too noble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing is too noble, dearest George,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lavinia. \xe2\x80\x98And Pa, I\r\nhope you will be careful not to refer before Bella, if you can help\r\nit, to my engagement to George. It might seem like reminding her of her\r\nhaving cast herself away. And I hope, Pa, that you will think it equally\r\nright to avoid mentioning George\xe2\x80\x99s rising prospects, when Bella is\r\npresent. It might seem like taunting her with her own poor fortunes.\r\nLet me ever remember that I am her younger sister, and ever spare her\r\npainful contrasts, which could not but wound her sharply.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson expressed his belief that such was the demeanour of Angels.\r\nMiss Lavvy replied with solemnity, \xe2\x80\x98No, dearest George, I am but too\r\nwell aware that I am merely human.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer, for her part, still further improved the occasion by sitting\r\nwith her eyes fastened on her husband, like two great black notes of\r\ninterrogation, severely inquiring, Are you looking into your breast? Do\r\nyou deserve your blessings? Can you lay your hand upon your heart and\r\nsay that you are worthy of so hysterical a daughter? I do not ask you if\r\nyou are worthy of such a wife--put Me out of the question--but are\r\nyou sufficiently conscious of, and thankful for, the pervading moral\r\ngrandeur of the family spectacle on which you are gazing? These\r\ninquiries proved very harassing to R. W. who, besides being a little\r\ndisturbed by wine, was in perpetual terror of committing himself by the\r\nutterance of stray words that would betray his guilty foreknowledge.\r\nHowever, the scene being over, and--all things considered--well over, he\r\nsought refuge in a doze; which gave his lady immense offence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you think of your daughter Bella, and sleep?\xe2\x80\x99 she disdainfully\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\nTo which he mildly answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think I can, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, with solemn indignation, \xe2\x80\x98I would recommend\r\nyou, if you have a human feeling, to retire to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied; \xe2\x80\x98I think it IS the best place for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd with these unsympathetic words very gladly withdrew.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks afterwards, the Mendicant\xe2\x80\x99s bride (arm-in-arm with\r\nthe Mendicant) came to tea, in fulfilment of an engagement made through\r\nher father. And the way in which the Mendicant\xe2\x80\x99s bride dashed at the\r\nunassailable position so considerately to be held by Miss Lavy, and\r\nscattered the whole of the works in all directions in a moment, was\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, running into the room with a radiant face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98how do you do, dearest Ma?\xe2\x80\x99 And then embraced her, joyously. \xe2\x80\x98And Lavvy\r\ndarling, how do YOU do, and how\xe2\x80\x99s George Sampson, and how is he getting\r\non, and when are you going to be married, and how rich are you going\r\nto grow? You must tell me all about it, Lavvy dear, immediately.\r\nJohn, love, kiss Ma and Lavvy, and then we shall all be at home and\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer stared, but was helpless. Miss Lavinia stared, but was\r\nhelpless. Apparently with no compunction, and assuredly with no\r\nceremony, Bella tossed her bonnet away, and sat down to make the tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Ma and Lavvy, you both take sugar, I know. And Pa (you good\r\nlittle Pa), you don\xe2\x80\x99t take milk. John does. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t before I was\r\nmarried; but I do now, because John does. John dear, did you kiss Ma and\r\nLavvy? Oh, you did! Quite correct, John dear; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you do\r\nit, so I asked. Cut some bread and butter, John; that\xe2\x80\x99s a love. Ma likes\r\nit doubled. And now you must tell me, dearest Ma and Lavvy, upon your\r\nwords and honours! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you for a moment--just a moment--think I was a\r\ndreadful little wretch when I wrote to say I had run away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs Wilfer could wave her gloves, the Mendicant\xe2\x80\x99s bride in her\r\nmerriest affectionate manner went on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think it must have made you rather cross, dear Ma and Lavvy, and I\r\nknow I deserved that you should be very cross. But you see I had been\r\nsuch a heedless, heartless creature, and had led you so to expect that\r\nI should marry for money, and so to make sure that I was incapable of\r\nmarrying for love, that I thought you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. Because, you\r\nsee, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much of Good, Good, Good, I had learnt from\r\nJohn. Well! So I was sly about it, and ashamed of what you supposed me\r\nto be, and fearful that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand one another and might\r\ncome to words, which we should all be sorry for afterwards, and so I\r\nsaid to John that if he liked to take me without any fuss, he might. And\r\nas he did like, I let him. And we were married at Greenwich church in\r\nthe presence of nobody--except an unknown individual who dropped in,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhere her eyes sparkled more brightly, \xe2\x80\x98and half a pensioner. And now,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it nice, dearest Ma and Lavvy, to know that no words have been\r\nsaid which any of us can be sorry for, and that we are all the best of\r\nfriends at the pleasantest of teas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving got up and kissed them again, she slipped back to her chair\r\n(after a loop on the road to squeeze her husband round the neck) and\r\nagain went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now you will naturally want to know, dearest Ma and Lavvy, how\r\nwe live, and what we have got to live upon. Well! And so we live on\r\nBlackheath, in the charm--ingest of dolls\xe2\x80\x99 houses, de--lightfully\r\nfurnished, and we have a clever little servant who is de--cidedly\r\npretty, and we are economical and orderly, and do everything by\r\nclockwork, and we have a hundred and fifty pounds a year, and we\r\nhave all we want, and more. And lastly, if you would like to know in\r\nconfidence, as perhaps you may, what is my opinion of my husband, my\r\nopinion is--that I almost love him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if you would like to know in confidence, as perhaps you may,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid her husband, smiling, as he stood by her side, without her having\r\ndetected his approach, \xe2\x80\x98my opinion of my wife, my opinion is--.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nBella started up, and put her hand upon his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, Sir! No, John, dear! Seriously! Please not yet a while! I want to\r\nbe something so much worthier than the doll in the doll\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling, are you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not half, not a quarter, so much worthier as I hope you may some\r\nday find me! Try me through some reverse, John--try me through some\r\ntrial--and tell them after THAT, what you think of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, my Life,\xe2\x80\x99 said John. \xe2\x80\x98I promise it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s my dear John. And you won\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word now; will you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, with a very expressive look of admiration\r\naround him, \xe2\x80\x98speak a word now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laid her laughing cheek upon his breast to thank him, and said,\r\nlooking at the rest of them sideways out of her bright eyes: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go\r\nfurther, Pa and Ma and Lavvy. John don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect it--he has no idea of\r\nit--but I quite love him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven Mrs Wilfer relaxed under the influence of her married daughter, and\r\nseemed in a majestic manner to imply remotely that if R. W. had been a\r\nmore deserving object, she too might have condescended to come down from\r\nher pedestal for his beguilement. Miss Lavinia, on the other hand, had\r\nstrong doubts of the policy of the course of treatment, and whether it\r\nmight not spoil Mr Sampson, if experimented on in the case of that young\r\ngentleman. R. W. himself was for his part convinced that he was father\r\nof one of the most charming of girls, and that Rokesmith was the most\r\nfavoured of men; which opinion, if propounded to him, Rokesmith would\r\nprobably not have contested.\r\n\r\nThe newly-married pair left early, so that they might walk at leisure to\r\ntheir starting-place from London, for Greenwich. At first they were\r\nvery cheerful and talked much; but after a while, Bella fancied that her\r\nhusband was turning somewhat thoughtful. So she asked him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John dear, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Matter, my love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, looking up into his face, \xe2\x80\x98what you are\r\nthinking of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s not much in the thought, my soul. I was thinking whether you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to be rich?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You rich, John?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bella, shrinking a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, really rich. Say, as rich as Mr Boffin. You would like that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be almost afraid to try, John dear. Was he much the better for\r\nhis wealth? Was I much the better for the little part I once had in it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But all people are not the worse for riches, my own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most people?\xe2\x80\x99 Bella musingly suggested with raised eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor even most people, it may be hoped. If you were rich, for instance,\r\nyou would have a great power of doing good to others.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, for instance,\xe2\x80\x99 Bella playfully rejoined; \xe2\x80\x98but should I\r\nexercise the power, for instance? And again, sir, for instance; should\r\nI, at the same time, have a great power of doing harm to myself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaughing and pressing her arm, he retorted: \xe2\x80\x98But still, again for\r\ninstance; would you exercise that power?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, thoughtfully shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x98I hope not.\r\nI think not. But it\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to hope not and think not, without the\r\nriches.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you say, my darling--instead of that phrase--being poor?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nasked, looking earnestly at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I say, being poor! Because I am not poor. Dear John, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\npossible that you suppose I think we are poor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, my love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh John!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Understand me, sweetheart. I know that I am rich beyond all wealth in\r\nhaving you; but I think OF you, and think FOR you. In such a dress as\r\nyou are wearing now, you first charmed me, and in no dress could you\r\never look, to my thinking, more graceful or more beautiful. But you have\r\nadmired many finer dresses this very day; and is it not natural that I\r\nwish I could give them to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice that you should wish it, John. It brings these tears of\r\ngrateful pleasure into my eyes, to hear you say so with such tenderness.\r\nBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued, \xe2\x80\x98we are now walking through the muddy streets. I\r\nlove those pretty feet so dearly, that I feel as if I could not bear the\r\ndirt to soil the sole of your shoe. Is it not natural that I wish you\r\ncould ride in a carriage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very nice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, glancing downward at the feet in question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to know that you admire them so much, John dear, and since you do, I\r\nam sorry that these shoes are a full size too large. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a\r\ncarriage, believe me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would like one if you could have one, Bella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it for its own sake, half so well as such a wish for\r\nit. Dear John, your wishes are as real to me as the wishes in the Fairy\r\nstory, that were all fulfilled as soon as spoken. Wish me everything\r\nthat you can wish for the woman you dearly love, and I have as good as\r\ngot it, John. I have better than got it, John!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were not the less happy for such talk, and home was not the less\r\nhome for coming after it. Bella was fast developing a perfect genius\r\nfor home. All the loves and graces seemed (her husband thought) to have\r\ntaken domestic service with her, and to help her to make home engaging.\r\n\r\nHer married life glided happily on. She was alone all day, for, after an\r\nearly breakfast her husband repaired every morning to the City, and did\r\nnot return until their late dinner hour. He was \xe2\x80\x98in a China house,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nexplained to Bella: which she found quite satisfactory, without pursuing\r\nthe China house into minuter details than a wholesale vision of tea,\r\nrice, odd-smelling silks, carved boxes, and tight-eyed people in more\r\nthan double-soled shoes, with their pigtails pulling their heads of\r\nhair off, painted on transparent porcelain. She always walked with her\r\nhusband to the railroad, and was always there again to meet him; her old\r\ncoquettish ways a little sobered down (but not much), and her dress\r\nas daintily managed as if she managed nothing else. But, John gone to\r\nbusiness and Bella returned home, the dress would be laid aside, trim\r\nlittle wrappers and aprons would be substituted, and Bella, putting back\r\nher hair with both hands, as if she were making the most business-like\r\narrangements for going dramatically distracted, would enter on the\r\nhousehold affairs of the day. Such weighing and mixing and chopping\r\nand grating, such dusting and washing and polishing, such snipping\r\nand weeding and trowelling and other small gardening, such making and\r\nmending and folding and airing, such diverse arrangements, and above all\r\nsuch severe study! For Mrs J. R., who had never been wont to do too much\r\nat home as Miss B. W., was under the constant necessity of referring for\r\nadvice and support to a sage volume entitled The Complete British Family\r\nHousewife, which she would sit consulting, with her elbows on the table\r\nand her temples on her hands, like some perplexed enchantress poring\r\nover the Black Art. This, principally because the Complete British\r\nHousewife, however sound a Briton at heart, was by no means an expert\r\nBriton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue,\r\nand sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the\r\nKamskatchan language. In any crisis of this nature, Bella would suddenly\r\nexclaim aloud, \xe2\x80\x98Oh you ridiculous old thing, what do you mean by that?\r\nYou must have been drinking!\xe2\x80\x99 And having made this marginal note, would\r\ntry the Housewife again, with all her dimples screwed into an expression\r\nof profound research.\r\n\r\nThere was likewise a coolness on the part of the British Housewife,\r\nwhich Mrs John Rokesmith found highly exasperating. She would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take a salamander,\xe2\x80\x99 as if a general should command a private to catch\r\na Tartar. Or, she would casually issue the order, \xe2\x80\x98Throw in a handful--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nof something entirely unattainable. In these, the Housewife\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\nglaring moments of unreason, Bella would shut her up and knock her on\r\nthe table, apostrophising her with the compliment, \xe2\x80\x98O you ARE a stupid\r\nold Donkey! Where am I to get it, do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother branch of study claimed the attention of Mrs John Rokesmith for\r\na regular period every day. This was the mastering of the newspaper, so\r\nthat she might be close up with John on general topics when John came\r\nhome. In her desire to be in all things his companion, she would have\r\nset herself with equal zeal to master Algebra, or Euclid, if he had\r\ndivided his soul between her and either. Wonderful was the way in which\r\nshe would store up the City Intelligence, and beamingly shed it\r\nupon John in the course of the evening; incidentally mentioning the\r\ncommodities that were looking up in the markets, and how much gold had\r\nbeen taken to the Bank, and trying to look wise and serious over it\r\nuntil she would laugh at herself most charmingly and would say, kissing\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98It all comes of my love, John dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor a City man, John certainly did appear to care as little as might be\r\nfor the looking up or looking down of things, as well as for the gold\r\nthat got taken to the Bank. But he cared, beyond all expression, for his\r\nwife, as a most precious and sweet commodity that was always looking up,\r\nand that never was worth less than all the gold in the world. And she,\r\nbeing inspired by her affection, and having a quick wit and a fine ready\r\ninstinct, made amazing progress in her domestic efficiency, though,\r\nas an endearing creature, she made no progress at all. This was her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, and he justified it by telling her that she had begun\r\nher married life as the most endearing creature that could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you have such a cheerful spirit!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, fondly. \xe2\x80\x98You are like a\r\nbright light in the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I truly, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you truly? Yes, indeed. Only much more, and much better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know, John dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, taking him by a button of his\r\ncoat, \xe2\x80\x98that I sometimes, at odd moments--don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, John, please.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNothing should induce John to do it, when she asked him not to do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--That I sometimes think, John, I feel a little serious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you too much alone, my darling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O dear, no, John! The time is so short that I have not a moment too\r\nmuch in the week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why serious, my life, then? When serious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I laugh, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, laughing as she laid her head upon\r\nhis shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe, sir, that I feel serious now? But I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99 And she laughed again, and something glistened in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you like to be rich, pet?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked her coaxingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rich, John! How CAN you ask such goose\xe2\x80\x99s questions?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you regret anything, my love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Regret anything? No!\xe2\x80\x99 Bella confidently answered. But then, suddenly\r\nchanging, she said, between laughing and glistening: \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, I do\r\nthough. I regret Mrs Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I, too, regret that separation very much. But perhaps it is only\r\ntemporary. Perhaps things may so fall out, as that you may sometimes see\r\nher again--as that we may sometimes see her again.\xe2\x80\x99 Bella might be very\r\nanxious on the subject, but she scarcely seemed so at the moment. With\r\nan absent air, she was investigating that button on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s coat,\r\nwhen Pa came in to spend the evening.\r\n\r\nPa had his special chair and his special corner reserved for him on\r\nall occasions, and--without disparagement of his domestic joys--was far\r\nhappier there, than anywhere. It was always pleasantly droll to see Pa\r\nand Bella together; but on this present evening her husband thought her\r\nmore than usually fantastic with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a very good little boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98to come unexpectedly,\r\nas soon as you could get out of school. And how have they used you at\r\nschool to-day, you dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my pet,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the cherub, smiling and rubbing his hands as she\r\nsat him down in his chair, \xe2\x80\x98I attend two schools. There\xe2\x80\x99s the Mincing\r\nLane establishment, and there\xe2\x80\x99s your mother\xe2\x80\x99s Academy. Which might you\r\nmean, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Both,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Both, eh? Why, to say the truth, both have taken a little out of me\r\nto-day, my dear, but that was to be expected. There\xe2\x80\x99s no royal road to\r\nlearning; and what is life but learning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you do with yourself when you have got your learning by\r\nheart, you silly child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why then, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cherub, after a little consideration, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsuppose I die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a very bad boy,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bella, \xe2\x80\x98to talk about dismal things\r\nand be out of spirits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined her father, \xe2\x80\x98I am not out of spirits. I am as gay\r\nas a lark.\xe2\x80\x99 Which his face confirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then if you are sure and certain it\xe2\x80\x99s not you, I suppose it must be\r\nI,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98so I won\xe2\x80\x99t do so any more. John dear, we must give this\r\nlittle fellow his supper, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course we must, my darling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has been grubbing and grubbing at school,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, looking at\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s hand and lightly slapping it, \xe2\x80\x98till he\xe2\x80\x99s not fit to be\r\nseen. O what a grubby child!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father, \xe2\x80\x98I was going to ask to be allowed to\r\nwash my hands, only you find me out so soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come here, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, taking him by the front of his coat,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98come here and be washed directly. You are not to be trusted to do it\r\nfor yourself. Come here, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cherub, to his genial amusement, was accordingly conducted to a\r\nlittle washing-room, where Bella soaped his face and rubbed his face,\r\nand soaped his hands and rubbed his hands, and splashed him and rinsed\r\nhim and towelled him, until he was as red as beet-root, even to his very\r\nears: \xe2\x80\x98Now you must be brushed and combed, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, busily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold the light, John. Shut your eyes, sir, and let me take hold of your\r\nchin. Be good directly, and do as you are told!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer father being more than willing to obey, she dressed his hair in her\r\nmost elaborate manner, brushing it out straight, parting it, winding it\r\nover her fingers, sticking it up on end, and constantly falling back on\r\nJohn to get a good look at the effect of it. Who always received her\r\non his disengaged arm, and detained her, while the patient cherub stood\r\nwaiting to be finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, when she had at last completed the final touches.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, you are something like a genteel boy! Put your jacket on, and come\r\nand have your supper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cherub investing himself with his coat was led back to his\r\ncorner--where, but for having no egotism in his pleasant nature, he\r\nwould have answered well enough for that radiant though self-sufficient\r\nboy, Jack Horner--Bella with her own hands laid a cloth for him, and\r\nbrought him his supper on a tray. \xe2\x80\x98Stop a moment,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98we must\r\nkeep his little clothes clean;\xe2\x80\x99 and tied a napkin under his chin, in a\r\nvery methodical manner.\r\n\r\nWhile he took his supper, Bella sat by him, sometimes admonishing him\r\nto hold his fork by the handle, like a polite child, and at other times\r\ncarving for him, or pouring out his drink. Fantastic as it all was, and\r\naccustomed as she ever had been to make a plaything of her good father,\r\never delighted that she should put him to that account, still there was\r\nan occasional something on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s part that was new. It could not be\r\nsaid that she was less playful, whimsical, or natural, than she always\r\nhad been; but it seemed, her husband thought, as if there were some\r\nrather graver reason than he had supposed for what she had so lately\r\nsaid, and as if throughout all this, there were glimpses of an\r\nunderlying seriousness.\r\n\r\nIt was a circumstance in support of this view of the case, that when she\r\nhad lighted her father\xe2\x80\x99s pipe, and mixed him his glass of grog, she sat\r\ndown on a stool between her father and her husband, leaning her arm upon\r\nthe latter, and was very quiet. So quiet, that when her father rose to\r\ntake his leave, she looked round with a start, as if she had forgotten\r\nhis being there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You go a little way with Pa, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear. Do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not written to Lizzie Hexam since I wrote and told her that I\r\nreally had a lover--a whole one. I have often thought I would like to\r\ntell her how right she was when she pretended to read in the live coals\r\nthat I would go through fire and water for him. I am in the humour to\r\ntell her so to-night, John, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay at home and do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are tired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all tired, John dear, but in the humour to write to Lizzie. Good\r\nnight, dear Pa. Good night, you dear, good, gentle Pa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLeft to herself she sat down to write, and wrote Lizzie a long letter.\r\nShe had but completed it and read it over, when her husband came back.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are just in time, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98I am going to give you your\r\nfirst curtain lecture. It shall be a parlour-curtain lecture. You shall\r\ntake this chair of mine when I have folded my letter, and I will take\r\nthe stool (though you ought to take it, I can tell you, sir, if it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe stool of repentance), and you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon find yourself taken to task\r\nsoundly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer letter folded, sealed, and directed, and her pen wiped, and her\r\nmiddle finger wiped, and her desk locked up and put away, and these\r\ntransactions performed with an air of severe business sedateness, which\r\nthe Complete British Housewife might have assumed, and certainly would\r\nnot have rounded off and broken down in with a musical laugh, as Bella\r\ndid: she placed her husband in his chair, and placed herself upon her\r\nstool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, sir! To begin at the beginning. What is your name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA question more decidedly rushing at the secret he was keeping from\r\nher, could not have astounded him. But he kept his countenance and his\r\nsecret, and answered, \xe2\x80\x98John Rokesmith, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good boy! Who gave you that name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a returning suspicion that something might have betrayed him to\r\nher, he answered, interrogatively, \xe2\x80\x98My godfathers and my godmothers,\r\ndear love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty good!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98Not goodest good, because you hesitate about\r\nit. However, as you know your Catechism fairly, so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you off\r\nthe rest. Now, I am going to examine you out of my own head. John dear,\r\nwhy did you go back, this evening, to the question you once asked me\r\nbefore--would I like to be rich?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain, his secret! He looked down at her as she looked up at him, with\r\nher hands folded on his knee, and it was as nearly told as ever secret\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nHaving no reply ready, he could do no better than embrace her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In short, dear John,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98this is the topic of my lecture: I\r\nwant nothing on earth, and I want you to believe it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s all, the lecture may be considered over, for I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not all, John dear,\xe2\x80\x99 Bella hesitated. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only Firstly. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na dreadful Secondly, and a dreadful Thirdly to come--as I used to say to\r\nmyself in sermon-time when I was a very small-sized sinner at church.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let them come, my dearest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure, John dear; are you absolutely certain in your innermost\r\nheart of hearts--?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which is not in my keeping,\xe2\x80\x99 he rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, John, but the key is.--Are you absolutely certain that down at the\r\nbottom of that heart of hearts, which you have given to me as I\r\nhave given mine to you, there is no remembrance that I was once very\r\nmercenary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, if there were no remembrance in me of the time you speak of,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsoftly asked her with his lips to hers, \xe2\x80\x98could I love you quite as well\r\nas I do; could I have in the Calendar of my life the brightest of its\r\ndays; could I whenever I look at your dear face, or hear your dear\r\nvoice, see and hear my noble champion? It can never have been that which\r\nmade you serious, darling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No John, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that, and still less was it Mrs Boffin, though I\r\nlove her. Wait a moment, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on with the lecture. Give me a\r\nmoment, because I like to cry for joy. It\xe2\x80\x99s so delicious, John dear, to\r\ncry for joy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe did so on his neck, and, still clinging there, laughed a little when\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x98I think I am ready now for Thirdly, John.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am ready for Thirdly,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, \xe2\x80\x98whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe, John,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that you believe that I believe--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 cried her husband gaily, \xe2\x80\x98what a quantity of\r\nbelieving!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, with another laugh. \xe2\x80\x98I never knew such a\r\nquantity! It\xe2\x80\x99s like verbs in an exercise. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on with less\r\nbelieving. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try again. I believe, dear John, that you believe that\r\nI believe that we have as much money as we require, and that we want for\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is strictly true, Bella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if our money should by any means be rendered not so much--if we\r\nhad to stint ourselves a little in purchases that we can afford to\r\nmake now--would you still have the same confidence in my being quite\r\ncontented, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely the same confidence, my soul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, John dear, thousands upon thousands of times. And I may take\r\nit for granted, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 with a little faltering, \xe2\x80\x98that you would be\r\nquite as contented yourself John? But, yes, I know I may. For, knowing\r\nthat I should be so, how surely I may know that you would be so; you who\r\nare so much stronger, and firmer, and more reasonable and more generous,\r\nthan I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband, \xe2\x80\x98I must not hear that. You are all wrong\r\nthere, though otherwise as right as can be. And now I am brought to a\r\nlittle piece of news, my dearest, that I might have told you earlier\r\nin the evening. I have strong reason for confidently believing that\r\nwe shall never be in the receipt of a smaller income than our present\r\nincome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe might have shown herself more interested in the intelligence;\r\nbut she had returned to the investigation of the coat-button that had\r\nengaged her attention a few hours before, and scarcely seemed to heed\r\nwhat he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now we have got to the bottom of it at last,\xe2\x80\x99 cried her husband,\r\nrallying her, \xe2\x80\x98and this is the thing that made you serious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, twisting the button and shaking her head, \xe2\x80\x98it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why then, Lord bless this little wife of mine, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Fourthly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This worried me a little, and so did Secondly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, occupied\r\nwith the button, \xe2\x80\x98but it was quite another sort of seriousness--a much\r\ndeeper and quieter sort of seriousness--that I spoke of John dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he bent his face to hers, she raised hers to meet it, and laid her\r\nlittle right hand on his eyes, and kept it there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember, John, on the day we were married, Pa\xe2\x80\x99s speaking of the\r\nships that might be sailing towards us from the unknown seas?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly, my darling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think...among them...there is a ship upon the ocean...bringing...to\r\nyou and me...a little baby, John.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nA CRY FOR HELP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Paper Mill had stopped work for the night, and the paths and roads\r\nin its neighbourhood were sprinkled with clusters of people going home\r\nfrom their day\xe2\x80\x99s labour in it. There were men, women, and children in\r\nthe groups, and there was no want of lively colour to flutter in the\r\ngentle evening wind. The mingling of various voices and the sound of\r\nlaughter made a cheerful impression upon the ear, analogous to that of\r\nthe fluttering colours upon the eye. Into the sheet of water reflecting\r\nthe flushed sky in the foreground of the living picture, a knot of\r\nurchins were casting stones, and watching the expansion of the rippling\r\ncircles. So, in the rosy evening, one might watch the ever-widening\r\nbeauty of the landscape--beyond the newly-released workers wending\r\nhome--beyond the silver river--beyond the deep green fields of corn, so\r\nprospering, that the loiterers in their narrow threads of pathway seemed\r\nto float immersed breast-high--beyond the hedgerows and the clumps of\r\ntrees--beyond the windmills on the ridge--away to where the sky appeared\r\nto meet the earth, as if there were no immensity of space between\r\nmankind and Heaven.\r\n\r\nIt was a Saturday evening, and at such a time the village dogs, always\r\nmuch more interested in the doings of humanity than in the affairs of\r\ntheir own species, were particularly active. At the general shop, at\r\nthe butcher\xe2\x80\x99s and at the public-house, they evinced an inquiring spirit\r\nnever to be satiated. Their especial interest in the public-house would\r\nseem to imply some latent rakishness in the canine character; for little\r\nwas eaten there, and they, having no taste for beer or tobacco (Mrs\r\nHubbard\xe2\x80\x99s dog is said to have smoked, but proof is wanting), could only\r\nhave been attracted by sympathy with loose convivial habits. Moreover,\r\na most wretched fiddle played within; a fiddle so unutterably vile, that\r\none lean long-bodied cur, with a better ear than the rest, found himself\r\nunder compulsion at intervals to go round the corner and howl. Yet, even\r\nhe returned to the public-house on each occasion with the tenacity of a\r\nconfirmed drunkard.\r\n\r\nFearful to relate, there was even a sort of little Fair in the village.\r\nSome despairing gingerbread that had been vainly trying to dispose of\r\nitself all over the country, and had cast a quantity of dust upon its\r\nhead in its mortification, again appealed to the public from an infirm\r\nbooth. So did a heap of nuts, long, long exiled from Barcelona, and yet\r\nspeaking English so indifferently as to call fourteen of themselves\r\na pint. A Peep-show which had originally started with the Battle of\r\nWaterloo, and had since made it every other battle of later date\r\nby altering the Duke of Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s nose, tempted the student of\r\nillustrated history. A Fat Lady, perhaps in part sustained upon\r\npostponed pork, her professional associate being a Learned Pig,\r\ndisplayed her life-size picture in a low dress as she appeared when\r\npresented at Court, several yards round. All this was a vicious\r\nspectacle as any poor idea of amusement on the part of the rougher\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water in this land of England ever is and\r\nshall be. They MUST NOT vary the rheumatism with amusement. They may\r\nvary it with fever and ague, or with as many rheumatic variations as\r\nthey have joints; but positively not with entertainment after their own\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe various sounds arising from this scene of depravity, and floating\r\naway into the still evening air, made the evening, at any point which\r\nthey just reached fitfully, mellowed by the distance, more still by\r\ncontrast. Such was the stillness of the evening to Eugene Wrayburn, as\r\nhe walked by the river with his hands behind him.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly, and with the measured step and preoccupied air of one\r\nwho was waiting. He walked between the two points, an osier-bed at this\r\nend and some floating lilies at that, and at each point stopped and\r\nlooked expectantly in one direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very quiet,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\nIt was very quiet. Some sheep were grazing on the grass by the\r\nriver-side, and it seemed to him that he had never before heard the\r\ncrisp tearing sound with which they cropped it. He stopped idly, and\r\nlooked at them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are stupid enough, I suppose. But if you are clever enough to get\r\nthrough life tolerably to your satisfaction, you have got the better of\r\nme, Man as I am, and Mutton as you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA rustle in a field beyond the hedge attracted his attention. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhere to do?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked himself leisurely going towards the gate and\r\nlooking over. \xe2\x80\x98No jealous paper-miller? No pleasures of the chase in\r\nthis part of the country? Mostly fishing hereabouts!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe field had been newly mown, and there were yet the marks of the\r\nscythe on the yellow-green ground, and the track of wheels where the hay\r\nhad been carried. Following the tracks with his eyes, the view closed\r\nwith the new hayrick in a corner.\r\n\r\nNow, if he had gone on to the hayrick, and gone round it? But, say\r\nthat the event was to be, as the event fell out, and how idle are such\r\nsuppositions! Besides, if he had gone; what is there of warning in a\r\nBargeman lying on his face?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A bird flying to the hedge,\xe2\x80\x99 was all he thought about it; and came\r\nback, and resumed his walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had not a reliance on her being truthful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, after\r\ntaking some half-dozen turns, \xe2\x80\x98I should begin to think she had given me\r\nthe slip for the second time. But she promised, and she is a girl of her\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTurning again at the water-lilies, he saw her coming, and advanced to\r\nmeet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was saying to myself, Lizzie, that you were sure to come, though you\r\nwere late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had to linger through the village as if I had no object before me,\r\nand I had to speak to several people in passing along, Mr Wrayburn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are the lads of the village--and the ladies--such scandal-mongers?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nasked, as he took her hand and drew it through his arm.\r\n\r\nShe submitted to walk slowly on, with downcast eyes. He put her hand to\r\nhis lips, and she quietly drew it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you walk beside me, Mr Wrayburn, and not touch me?\xe2\x80\x99 For, his arm\r\nwas already stealing round her waist.\r\n\r\nShe stopped again, and gave him an earnest supplicating look. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nLizzie, well!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in an easy way though ill at ease with himself\r\n\xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be unhappy, don\xe2\x80\x99t be reproachful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot help being unhappy, but I do not mean to be reproachful. Mr\r\nWrayburn, I implore you to go away from this neighbourhood, to-morrow\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie!\xe2\x80\x99 he remonstrated. \xe2\x80\x98As well be reproachful as\r\nwholly unreasonable. I can\xe2\x80\x99t go away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Faith!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene in his airily candid manner. \xe2\x80\x98Because you won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme. Mind! I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be reproachful either. I don\xe2\x80\x99t complain that\r\nyou design to keep me here. But you do it, you do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you walk beside me, and not touch me;\xe2\x80\x99 for, his arm was coming\r\nabout her again; \xe2\x80\x98while I speak to you very seriously, Mr Wrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will do anything within the limits of possibility, for you, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe answered with pleasant gaiety as he folded his arms. \xe2\x80\x98See here!\r\nNapoleon Buonaparte at St Helena.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you spoke to me as I came from the Mill the night before last,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Lizzie, fixing her eyes upon him with the look of supplication\r\nwhich troubled his better nature, \xe2\x80\x98you told me that you were much\r\nsurprised to see me, and that you were on a solitary fishing excursion.\r\nWas it true?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene composedly, \xe2\x80\x98in the least true. I came\r\nhere, because I had information that I should find you here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you imagine why I left London, Mr Wrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 he openly answered, \xe2\x80\x98that you left London to get\r\nrid of me. It is not flattering to my self-love, but I am afraid you\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could you be so cruel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Mr Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, suddenly breaking into tears, \xe2\x80\x98is the\r\ncruelty on my side! O Mr Wrayburn, Mr Wrayburn, is there no cruelty in\r\nyour being here to-night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the name of all that\xe2\x80\x99s good--and that is not conjuring you in my\r\nown name, for Heaven knows I am not good\xe2\x80\x99--said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ndistressed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What else can I be, when I know the distance and the difference between\r\nus? What else can I be, when to tell me why you came here, is to put me\r\nto shame!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, covering her face.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a real sentiment of remorseful tenderness and\r\npity. It was not strong enough to impell him to sacrifice himself and\r\nspare her, but it was a strong emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie! I never thought before, that there was a woman in the world who\r\ncould affect me so much by saying so little. But don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard in your\r\nconstruction of me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what my state of mind towards you is.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you haunt me and bewilder me. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the\r\ncursed carelessness that is over-officious in helping me at every other\r\nturning of my life, WON\xe2\x80\x99T help me here. You have struck it dead, I\r\nthink, and I sometimes almost wish you had struck me dead along with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had not been prepared for such passionate expressions, and they\r\nawakened some natural sparks of feminine pride and joy in her breast. To\r\nconsider, wrong as he was, that he could care so much for her, and that\r\nshe had the power to move him so!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It grieves you to see me distressed, Mr Wrayburn; it grieves me to see\r\nyou distressed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you. Indeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you.\r\nYou have not felt this as I feel it, being so different from me, and\r\nbeginning from another point of view. You have not thought. But I\r\nentreat you to think now, think now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What am I to think of?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Eugene, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Think of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me how NOT to think of you, Lizzie, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll change me\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in that way. Think of me, as belonging to another station,\r\nand quite cut off from you in honour. Remember that I have no protector\r\nnear me, unless I have one in your noble heart. Respect my good name.\r\nIf you feel towards me, in one particular, as you might if I was a lady,\r\ngive me the full claims of a lady upon your generous behaviour. I am\r\nremoved from you and your family by being a working girl. How true a\r\ngentleman to be as considerate of me as if I was removed by being a\r\nQueen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe would have been base indeed to have stood untouched by her appeal.\r\nHis face expressed contrition and indecision as he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I injured you so much, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no. You may set me quite right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of the past, Mr\r\nWrayburn, but of the present and the future. Are we not here now,\r\nbecause through two days you have followed me so closely where there\r\nare so many eyes to see you, that I consented to this appointment as an\r\nescape?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Again, not very flattering to my self-love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, moodily; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nyes. Yes. Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I beseech you, Mr Wrayburn, I beg and pray you, leave this\r\nneighbourhood. If you do not, consider to what you will drive me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did consider within himself for a moment or two, and then retorted,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Drive you? To what shall I drive you, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will drive me away. I live here peacefully and respected, and I am\r\nwell employed here. You will force me to quit this place as I quitted\r\nLondon, and--by following me again--will force me to quit the next place\r\nin which I may find refuge, as I quitted this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you so determined, Lizzie--forgive the word I am going to use, for\r\nits literal truth--to fly from a lover?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so determined,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered resolutely, though trembling, \xe2\x80\x98to fly\r\nfrom such a lover. There was a poor woman died here but a little while\r\nago, scores of years older than I am, whom I found by chance, lying on\r\nthe wet earth. You may have heard some account of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I have,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98if her name was Higden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her name was Higden. Though she was so weak and old, she kept true to\r\none purpose to the very last. Even at the very last, she made me promise\r\nthat her purpose should be kept to, after she was dead, so settled\r\nwas her determination. What she did, I can do. Mr Wrayburn, if I\r\nbelieved--but I do not believe--that you could be so cruel to me as\r\nto drive me from place to place to wear me out, you should drive me to\r\ndeath and not do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked full at her handsome face, and in his own handsome face there\r\nwas a light of blended admiration, anger, and reproach, which she--who\r\nloved him so in secret whose heart had long been so full, and he the\r\ncause of its overflowing--drooped before. She tried hard to retain her\r\nfirmness, but he saw it melting away under his eyes. In the moment of\r\nits dissolution, and of his first full knowledge of his influence upon\r\nher, she dropped, and he caught her on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie! Rest so a moment. Answer what I ask you. If I had not been what\r\nyou call removed from you and cut off from you, would you have made this\r\nappeal to me to leave you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, Mr Wrayburn. Let me go back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I swear to you, Lizzie, you shall go directly. I swear to you, you\r\nshall go alone. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not accompany you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not follow you, if you will\r\nreply.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I, Mr Wrayburn? How can I tell you what I should have done, if\r\nyou had not been what you are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had not been what you make me out to be,\xe2\x80\x99 he struck in, skilfully\r\nchanging the form of words, \xe2\x80\x98would you still have hated me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Mr Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied appealingly, and weeping, \xe2\x80\x98you know me\r\nbetter than to think I do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had not been what you make me out to be, Lizzie, would you still\r\nhave been indifferent to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Mr Wrayburn,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered as before, \xe2\x80\x98you know me better than that\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something in the attitude of her whole figure as he supported\r\nit, and she hung her head, which besought him to be merciful and not\r\nforce her to disclose her heart. He was not merciful with her, and he\r\nmade her do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I know you better than quite to believe (unfortunate dog though I\r\nam!) that you hate me, or even that you are wholly indifferent to me,\r\nLizzie, let me know so much more from yourself before we separate. Let\r\nme know how you would have dealt with me if you had regarded me as being\r\nwhat you would have considered on equal terms with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is impossible, Mr Wrayburn. How can I think of you as being on equal\r\nterms with me? If my mind could put you on equal terms with me, you\r\ncould not be yourself. How could I remember, then, the night when I\r\nfirst saw you, and when I went out of the room because you looked at\r\nme so attentively? Or, the night that passed into the morning when you\r\nbroke to me that my father was dead? Or, the nights when you used to\r\ncome to see me at my next home? Or, your having known how uninstructed\r\nI was, and having caused me to be taught better? Or, my having so looked\r\nup to you and wondered at you, and at first thought you so good to be at\r\nall mindful of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only \xe2\x80\x9cat first\xe2\x80\x9d thought me so good, Lizzie? What did you think me after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cat first\xe2\x80\x9d? So bad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that. But after the first wonder and\r\npleasure of being noticed by one so different from any one who had ever\r\nspoken to me, I began to feel that it might have been better if I had\r\nnever seen you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you WERE so different,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered in a lower voice. \xe2\x80\x98Because\r\nit was so endless, so hopeless. Spare me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you think for me at all, Lizzie?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, as if he were a little\r\nstung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much, Mr Wrayburn. Not much until to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you tell me why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never supposed until to-night that you needed to be thought for. But\r\nif you do need to be; if you do truly feel at heart that you have indeed\r\nbeen towards me what you have called yourself to-night, and that there\r\nis nothing for us in this life but separation; then Heaven help you, and\r\nHeaven bless you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe purity with which in these words she expressed something of her\r\nown love and her own suffering, made a deep impression on him for the\r\npassing time. He held her, almost as if she were sanctified to him by\r\ndeath, and kissed her, once, almost as he might have kissed the dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promised that I would not accompany you, nor follow you. Shall I keep\r\nyou in view? You have been agitated, and it\xe2\x80\x99s growing dark.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am used to be out alone at this hour, and I entreat you not to do\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promise. I can bring myself to promise nothing more tonight, Lizzie,\r\nexcept that I will try what I can do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is but one means, Mr Wrayburn, of sparing yourself and of sparing\r\nme, every way. Leave this neighbourhood to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will try.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the words in a grave voice, she put her hand in his, removed\r\nit, and went away by the river-side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, could Mortimer believe this?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Eugene, still remaining,\r\nafter a while, where she had left him. \xe2\x80\x98Can I even believe it myself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe referred to the circumstance that there were tears upon his hand,\r\nas he stood covering his eyes. \xe2\x80\x98A most ridiculous position this, to be\r\nfound out in!\xe2\x80\x99 was his next thought. And his next struck its root in a\r\nlittle rising resentment against the cause of the tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet I have gained a wonderful power over her, too, let her be as much\r\nin earnest as she will!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe reflection brought back the yielding of her face and form as she\r\nhad drooped under his gaze. Contemplating the reproduction, he seemed\r\nto see, for the second time, in the appeal and in the confession of\r\nweakness, a little fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she loves me. And so earnest a character must be very earnest in\r\nthat passion. She cannot choose for herself to be strong in this fancy,\r\nwavering in that, and weak in the other. She must go through with her\r\nnature, as I must go through with mine. If mine exacts its pains and\r\npenalties all round, so must hers, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPursuing the inquiry into his own nature, he thought, \xe2\x80\x98Now, if I married\r\nher. If, outfacing the absurdity of the situation in correspondence with\r\nM. R. F., I astonished M. R. F. to the utmost extent of his respected\r\npowers, by informing him that I had married her, how would M. R. F.\r\nreason with the legal mind? \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry for some money and some\r\nstation, because you were frightfully likely to become bored. Are you\r\nless frightfully likely to become bored, marrying for no money and no\r\nstation? Are you sure of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d Legal mind, in spite of forensic\r\nprotestations, must secretly admit, \xe2\x80\x9cGood reasoning on the part of M. R.\r\nF. NOT sure of myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the very act of calling this tone of levity to his aid, he felt it to\r\nbe profligate and worthless, and asserted her against it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I should like to see the fellow (Mortimer\r\nexcepted) who would undertake to tell me that this was not a real\r\nsentiment on my part, won out of me by her beauty and her worth,\r\nin spite of myself, and that I would not be true to her. I should\r\nparticularly like to see the fellow to-night who would tell me so, or\r\nwho would tell me anything that could be construed to her disadvantage;\r\nfor I am wearily out of sorts with one Wrayburn who cuts a sorry figure,\r\nand I would far rather be out of sorts with somebody else. \xe2\x80\x9cEugene,\r\nEugene, Eugene, this is a bad business.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah! So go the Mortimer\r\nLightwood bells, and they sound melancholy to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStrolling on, he thought of something else to take himself to task for.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is the analogy, Brute Beast,\xe2\x80\x99 he said impatiently, \xe2\x80\x98between a\r\nwoman whom your father coolly finds out for you and a woman whom you\r\nhave found out for yourself, and have ever drifted after with more and\r\nmore of constancy since you first set eyes upon her? Ass! Can you reason\r\nno better than that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, again he subsided into a reminiscence of his first full knowledge\r\nof his power just now, and of her disclosure of her heart. To try no\r\nmore to go away, and to try her again, was the reckless conclusion it\r\nturned uppermost. And yet again, \xe2\x80\x98Eugene, Eugene, Eugene, this is a bad\r\nbusiness!\xe2\x80\x99 And, \xe2\x80\x98I wish I could stop the Lightwood peal, for it sounds\r\nlike a knell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking above, he found that the young moon was up, and that the stars\r\nwere beginning to shine in the sky from which the tones of red and\r\nyellow were flickering out, in favour of the calm blue of a summer\r\nnight. He was still by the river-side. Turning suddenly, he met a man,\r\nso close upon him that Eugene, surprised, stepped back, to avoid a\r\ncollision. The man carried something over his shoulder which might\r\nhave been a broken oar, or spar, or bar, and took no notice of him, but\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Halloa, friend!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, calling after him, \xe2\x80\x98are you blind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man made no reply, but went his way.\r\n\r\nEugene Wrayburn went the opposite way, with his hands behind him and his\r\npurpose in his thoughts. He passed the sheep, and passed the gate, and\r\ncame within hearing of the village sounds, and came to the bridge. The\r\ninn where he stayed, like the village and the mill, was not across\r\nthe river, but on that side of the stream on which he walked. However,\r\nknowing the rushy bank and the backwater on the other side to be a\r\nretired place, and feeling out of humour for noise or company, he\r\ncrossed the bridge, and sauntered on: looking up at the stars as they\r\nseemed one by one to be kindled in the sky, and looking down at the\r\nriver as the same stars seemed to be kindled deep in the water. A\r\nlanding-place overshadowed by a willow, and a pleasure-boat lying moored\r\nthere among some stakes, caught his eye as he passed along. The spot was\r\nin such dark shadow, that he paused to make out what was there, and then\r\npassed on again.\r\n\r\nThe rippling of the river seemed to cause a correspondent stir in his\r\nuneasy reflections. He would have laid them asleep if he could, but they\r\nwere in movement, like the stream, and all tending one way with a strong\r\ncurrent. As the ripple under the moon broke unexpectedly now and then,\r\nand palely flashed in a new shape and with a new sound, so parts of\r\nhis thoughts started, unbidden, from the rest, and revealed their\r\nwickedness. \xe2\x80\x98Out of the question to marry her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98and out of\r\nthe question to leave her. The crisis!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had sauntered far enough. Before turning to retrace his steps, he\r\nstopped upon the margin, to look down at the reflected night. In an\r\ninstant, with a dreadful crash, the reflected night turned crooked,\r\nflames shot jaggedly across the air, and the moon and stars came\r\nbursting from the sky.\r\n\r\nWas he struck by lightning? With some incoherent half-formed thought\r\nto that effect, he turned under the blows that were blinding him and\r\nmashing his life, and closed with a murderer, whom he caught by a red\r\nneckerchief--unless the raining down of his own blood gave it that hue.\r\n\r\nEugene was light, active, and expert; but his arms were broken, or he\r\nwas paralysed, and could do no more than hang on to the man, with his\r\nhead swung back, so that he could see nothing but the heaving sky. After\r\ndragging at the assailant, he fell on the bank with him, and then there\r\nwas another great crash, and then a splash, and all was done.\r\n\r\nLizzie Hexam, too, had avoided the noise, and the Saturday movement of\r\npeople in the straggling street, and chose to walk alone by the water\r\nuntil her tears should be dry, and she could so compose herself as\r\nto escape remark upon her looking ill or unhappy on going home. The\r\npeaceful serenity of the hour and place, having no reproaches or evil\r\nintentions within her breast to contend against, sank healingly into\r\nits depths. She had meditated and taken comfort. She, too, was turning\r\nhomeward, when she heard a strange sound.\r\n\r\nIt startled her, for it was like a sound of blows. She stood still, and\r\nlistened. It sickened her, for blows fell heavily and cruelly on the\r\nquiet of the night. As she listened, undecided, all was silent. As she\r\nyet listened, she heard a faint groan, and a fall into the river.\r\n\r\nHer old bold life and habit instantly inspired her. Without vain waste\r\nof breath in crying for help where there were none to hear, she ran\r\ntowards the spot from which the sounds had come. It lay between her and\r\nthe bridge, but it was more removed from her than she had thought; the\r\nnight being so very quiet, and sound travelling far with the help of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt length, she reached a part of the green bank, much and newly trodden,\r\nwhere there lay some broken splintered pieces of wood and some torn\r\nfragments of clothes. Stooping, she saw that the grass was bloody.\r\nFollowing the drops and smears, she saw that the watery margin of the\r\nbank was bloody. Following the current with her eyes, she saw a bloody\r\nface turned up towards the moon, and drifting away.\r\n\r\nNow, merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time, and grant, O Blessed\r\nLord, that through thy wonderful workings it may turn to good at last!\r\nTo whomsoever the drifting face belongs, be it man\xe2\x80\x99s or woman\xe2\x80\x99s, help\r\nmy humble hands, Lord God, to raise it from death and restore it to some\r\none to whom it must be dear!\r\n\r\nIt was thought, fervently thought, but not for a moment did the prayer\r\ncheck her. She was away before it welled up in her mind, away, swift\r\nand true, yet steady above all--for without steadiness it could never\r\nbe done--to the landing-place under the willow-tree, where she also had\r\nseen the boat lying moored among the stakes.\r\n\r\nA sure touch of her old practised hand, a sure step of her old practised\r\nfoot, a sure light balance of her body, and she was in the boat. A\r\nquick glance of her practised eye showed her, even through the deep dark\r\nshadow, the sculls in a rack against the red-brick garden-wall. Another\r\nmoment, and she had cast off (taking the line with her), and the boat\r\nhad shot out into the moonlight, and she was rowing down the stream as\r\nnever other woman rowed on English water.\r\n\r\nIntently over her shoulder, without slackening speed, she looked ahead\r\nfor the driving face. She passed the scene of the struggle--yonder it\r\nwas, on her left, well over the boat\xe2\x80\x99s stern--she passed on her right,\r\nthe end of the village street, a hilly street that almost dipped into\r\nthe river; its sounds were growing faint again, and she slackened;\r\nlooking as the boat drove, everywhere, everywhere, for the floating\r\nface.\r\n\r\nShe merely kept the boat before the stream now, and rested on her oars,\r\nknowing well that if the face were not soon visible, it had gone down,\r\nand she would overshoot it. An untrained sight would never have seen by\r\nthe moonlight what she saw at the length of a few strokes astern. She\r\nsaw the drowning figure rise to the surface, slightly struggle, and as\r\nif by instinct turn over on its back to float. Just so had she first\r\ndimly seen the face which she now dimly saw again.\r\n\r\nFirm of look and firm of purpose, she intently watched its coming on,\r\nuntil it was very near; then, with a touch unshipped her sculls, and\r\ncrept aft in the boat, between kneeling and crouching. Once, she let the\r\nbody evade her, not being sure of her grasp. Twice, and she had seized\r\nit by its bloody hair.\r\n\r\nIt was insensible, if not virtually dead; it was mutilated, and streaked\r\nthe water all about it with dark red streaks. As it could not help\r\nitself, it was impossible for her to get it on board. She bent over the\r\nstern to secure it with the line, and then the river and its shores rang\r\nto the terrible cry she uttered.\r\n\r\nBut, as if possessed by supernatural spirit and strength, she lashed\r\nit safe, resumed her seat, and rowed in, desperately, for the nearest\r\nshallow water where she might run the boat aground. Desperately, but not\r\nwildly, for she knew that if she lost distinctness of intention, all was\r\nlost and gone.\r\n\r\nShe ran the boat ashore, went into the water, released him from the\r\nline, and by main strength lifted him in her arms and laid him in the\r\nbottom of the boat. He had fearful wounds upon him, and she bound them\r\nup with her dress torn into strips. Else, supposing him to be still\r\nalive, she foresaw that he must bleed to death before he could be landed\r\nat his inn, which was the nearest place for succour.\r\n\r\nThis done very rapidly, she kissed his disfigured forehead, looked up\r\nin anguish to the stars, and blessed him and forgave him, \xe2\x80\x98if she had\r\nanything to forgive.\xe2\x80\x99 It was only in that instant that she thought of\r\nherself, and then she thought of herself only for him.\r\n\r\nNow, merciful Heaven be thanked for that old time, enabling me, without\r\na wasted moment, to have got the boat afloat again, and to row back\r\nagainst the stream! And grant, O Blessed Lord God, that through poor me\r\nhe may be raised from death, and preserved to some one else to whom he\r\nmay be dear one day, though never dearer than to me!\r\n\r\nShe rowed hard--rowed desperately, but never wildly--and seldom removed\r\nher eyes from him in the bottom of the boat. She had so laid him there,\r\nas that she might see his disfigured face; it was so much disfigured\r\nthat his mother might have covered it, but it was above and beyond\r\ndisfigurement in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe boat touched the edge of the patch of inn lawn, sloping gently to\r\nthe water. There were lights in the windows, but there chanced to be\r\nno one out of doors. She made the boat fast, and again by main strength\r\ntook him up, and never laid him down until she laid him down in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nSurgeons were sent for, and she sat supporting his head. She had\r\noftentimes heard in days that were gone, how doctors would lift the hand\r\nof an insensible wounded person, and would drop it if the person were\r\ndead. She waited for the awful moment when the doctors might lift this\r\nhand, all broken and bruised, and let it fall.\r\n\r\nThe first of the surgeons came, and asked, before proceeding to his\r\nexamination, \xe2\x80\x98Who brought him in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I brought him in, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Lizzie, at whom all present looked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, my dear? You could not lift, far less carry, this weight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I could not, at another time, sir; but I am sure I did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe surgeon looked at her with great attention, and with some\r\ncompassion. Having with a grave face touched the wounds upon the head,\r\nand the broken arms, he took the hand.\r\n\r\nO! would he let it drop?\r\n\r\nHe appeared irresolute. He did not retain it, but laid it gently down,\r\ntook a candle, looked more closely at the injuries on the head, and at\r\nthe pupils of the eyes. That done, he replaced the candle and took the\r\nhand again. Another surgeon then coming in, the two exchanged a whisper,\r\nand the second took the hand. Neither did he let it fall at once, but\r\nkept it for a while and laid it gently down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Attend to the poor girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said the first surgeon then. \xe2\x80\x98She is quite\r\nunconscious. She sees nothing and hears nothing. All the better for\r\nher! Don\xe2\x80\x99t rouse her, if you can help it; only move her. Poor girl, poor\r\ngirl! She must be amazingly strong of heart, but it is much to be feared\r\nthat she has set her heart upon the dead. Be gentle with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nBETTER TO BE ABEL THAN CAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDay was breaking at Plashwater Weir Mill Lock. Stars were yet visible,\r\nbut there was dull light in the east that was not the light of night.\r\nThe moon had gone down, and a mist crept along the banks of the river,\r\nseen through which the trees were the ghosts of trees, and the water\r\nwas the ghost of water. This earth looked spectral, and so did the\r\npale stars: while the cold eastern glare, expressionless as to heat or\r\ncolour, with the eye of the firmament quenched, might have been likened\r\nto the stare of the dead.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was so likened by the lonely Bargeman, standing on the brink\r\nof the lock. For certain, Bradley Headstone looked that way, when a\r\nchill air came up, and when it passed on murmuring, as if it\r\nwhispered something that made the phantom trees and water tremble--or\r\nthreaten--for fancy might have made it either.\r\n\r\nHe turned away, and tried the Lock-house door. It was fastened on the\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered, knocking.\r\n\r\nRogue Riderhood was soon roused, and soon undrew the bolt and let him\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest, I thought you had been and got lost! Two nights away!\r\nI a\xe2\x80\x99most believed as you\xe2\x80\x99d giv\xe2\x80\x99 me the slip, and I had as good as half a\r\nmind for to advertise you in the newspapers to come for\xe2\x80\x99ard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley\xe2\x80\x99s face turned so dark on this hint, that Riderhood deemed it\r\nexpedient to soften it into a compliment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But not you, governor, not you,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, stolidly shaking his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For what did I say to myself arter having amused myself with that there\r\nstretch of a comic idea, as a sort of a playful game? Why, I says to\r\nmyself; \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a man o\xe2\x80\x99 honour.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s what I says to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nman o\xe2\x80\x99 double honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery remarkably, Riderhood put no question to him. He had looked at him\r\non opening the door, and he now looked at him again (stealthily this\r\ntime), and the result of his looking was, that he asked him no question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be for another forty on \xe2\x80\x98em, governor, as I judges, afore you\r\nturns your mind to breakfast,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, when his visitor sat\r\ndown, resting his chin on his hand, with his eyes on the ground. And\r\nvery remarkably again: Riderhood feigned to set the scanty furniture in\r\norder, while he spoke, to have a show of reason for not looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I had better sleep, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, without changing his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I myself should recommend it, governor,\xe2\x80\x99 assented Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Might you\r\nbe anyways dry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I should like a drink,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley; but without appearing to\r\nattend much.\r\n\r\nMr Riderhood got out his bottle, and fetched his jug-full of water,\r\nand administered a potation. Then, he shook the coverlet of his bed and\r\nspread it smooth, and Bradley stretched himself upon it in the clothes\r\nhe wore. Mr Riderhood poetically remarking that he would pick the bones\r\nof his night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, in his wooden chair, sat in the window as before;\r\nbut, as before, watched the sleeper narrowly until he was very sound\r\nasleep. Then, he rose and looked at him close, in the bright daylight,\r\non every side, with great minuteness. He went out to his Lock to sum up\r\nwhat he had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of his sleeves is tore right away below the elber, and the\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other\xe2\x80\x99s had a good rip at the shoulder. He\xe2\x80\x99s been hung on to, pretty\r\ntight, for his shirt\xe2\x80\x99s all tore out of the neck-gathers. He\xe2\x80\x99s been in\r\nthe grass and he\xe2\x80\x99s been in the water. And he\xe2\x80\x99s spotted, and I know with\r\nwhat, and with whose. Hooroar!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley slept long. Early in the afternoon a barge came down. Other\r\nbarges had passed through, both ways, before it; but the Lock-keeper\r\nhailed only this particular barge, for news, as if he had made a time\r\ncalculation with some nicety. The men on board told him a piece of news,\r\nand there was a lingering on their part to enlarge upon it.\r\n\r\nTwelve hours had intervened since Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s lying down, when he got up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I swaller it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, squinting at his Lock, when he\r\nsaw Bradley coming out of the house, \xe2\x80\x98as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a sleeping all the\r\ntime, old boy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley came to him, sitting on his wooden lever, and asked what o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nit was? Riderhood told him it was between two and three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When are you relieved?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Day arter to-morrow, governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not sooner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a inch sooner, governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn both sides, importance seemed attached to this question of relief.\r\nRiderhood quite petted his reply; saying a second time, and prolonging a\r\nnegative roll of his head, \xe2\x80\x98n--n--not a inch sooner, governor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I tell you I was going on to-night?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, governor,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Riderhood, in a cheerful, affable, and\r\nconversational manner, \xe2\x80\x98you did not tell me so. But most like you meant\r\nto it and forgot to it. How, otherways, could a doubt have come into\r\nyour head about it, governor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the sun goes down, I intend to go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the more necessairy is a Peck,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Come in\r\nand have it, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe formality of spreading a tablecloth not being observed in Mr\r\nRiderhood\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, the serving of the \xe2\x80\x98peck\xe2\x80\x99 was the affair of\r\na moment; it merely consisting in the handing down of a capacious baking\r\ndish with three-fourths of an immense meat pie in it, and the production\r\nof two pocket-knives, an earthenware mug, and a large brown bottle of\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\nBoth ate and drank, but Riderhood much the more abundantly. In lieu of\r\nplates, that honest man cut two triangular pieces from the thick crust\r\nof the pie, and laid them, inside uppermost, upon the table: the one\r\nbefore himself, and the other before his guest. Upon these platters he\r\nplaced two goodly portions of the contents of the pie, thus imparting\r\nthe unusual interest to the entertainment that each partaker scooped out\r\nthe inside of his plate, and consumed it with his other fare, besides\r\nhaving the sport of pursuing the clots of congealed gravy over the plain\r\nof the table, and successfully taking them into his mouth at last from\r\nthe blade of his knife, in case of their not first sliding off it.\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone was so remarkably awkward at these exercises, that the\r\nRogue observed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look out, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your hand!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, the caution came too late, for Bradley gashed it at the instant.\r\nAnd, what was more unlucky, in asking Riderhood to tie it up, and in\r\nstanding close to him for the purpose, he shook his hand under the smart\r\nof the wound, and shook blood over Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was done, and when what remained of the platters and what\r\nremained of the congealed gravy had been put back into what remained of\r\nthe pie, which served as an economical investment for all miscellaneous\r\nsavings, Riderhood filled the mug with beer and took a long drink. And\r\nnow he did look at Bradley, and with an evil eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99otherest!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, hoarsely, as he bent across the table to touch\r\nhis arm. \xe2\x80\x98The news has gone down the river afore you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What news?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who do you think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, with a hitch of his head, as if he\r\ndisdainfully jerked the feint away, \xe2\x80\x98picked up the body? Guess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not good at guessing anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She did. Hooroar! You had him there agin. She did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe convulsive twitching of Bradley Headstone\xe2\x80\x99s face, and the sudden\r\nhot humour that broke out upon it, showed how grimly the intelligence\r\ntouched him. But he said not a single word, good or bad. He only smiled\r\nin a lowering manner, and got up and stood leaning at the window,\r\nlooking through it. Riderhood followed him with his eyes. Riderhood cast\r\ndown his eyes on his own besprinkled clothes. Riderhood began to have an\r\nair of being better at a guess than Bradley owned to being.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been so long in want of rest,\xe2\x80\x99 said the schoolmaster, \xe2\x80\x98that with\r\nyour leave I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And welcome, T\xe2\x80\x99otherest!\xe2\x80\x99 was the hospitable answer of his host. He had\r\nlaid himself down without waiting for it, and he remained upon the bed\r\nuntil the sun was low. When he arose and came out to resume his journey,\r\nhe found his host waiting for him on the grass by the towing-path\r\noutside the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whenever it may be necessary that you and I should have any further\r\ncommunication together,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, \xe2\x80\x98I will come back. Good-night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, since no better can be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, turning on his heel,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-night!\xe2\x80\x99 But he turned again as the other set forth, and added\r\nunder his breath, looking after him with a leer: \xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be let to\r\ngo like that, if my Relief warn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as come. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch you up in\r\na mile.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a word, his real time of relief being that evening at sunset, his\r\nmate came lounging in, within a quarter of an hour. Not staying to fill\r\nup the utmost margin of his time, but borrowing an hour or so, to be\r\nrepaid again when he should relieve his reliever, Riderhood straightway\r\nfollowed on the track of Bradley Headstone.\r\n\r\nHe was a better follower than Bradley. It had been the calling of his\r\nlife to slink and skulk and dog and waylay, and he knew his calling\r\nwell. He effected such a forced march on leaving the Lock House that he\r\nwas close up with him--that is to say, as close up with him as he deemed\r\nit convenient to be--before another Lock was passed. His man looked back\r\npretty often as he went, but got no hint of him. HE knew how to take\r\nadvantage of the ground, and where to put the hedge between them, and\r\nwhere the wall, and when to duck, and when to drop, and had a thousand\r\narts beyond the doomed Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s slow conception.\r\n\r\nBut, all his arts were brought to a standstill, like himself when\r\nBradley, turning into a green lane or riding by the river-side--a\r\nsolitary spot run wild in nettles, briars, and brambles, and encumbered\r\nwith the scathed trunks of a whole hedgerow of felled trees, on the\r\noutskirts of a little wood--began stepping on these trunks and dropping\r\ndown among them and stepping on them again, apparently as a schoolboy\r\nmight have done, but assuredly with no schoolboy purpose, or want of\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you up to?\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Riderhood, down in the ditch, and holding\r\nthe hedge a little open with both hands. And soon his actions made a\r\nmost extraordinary reply. \xe2\x80\x98By George and the Draggin!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Riderhood,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98if he ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going to bathe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had passed back, on and among the trunks of trees again, and has\r\npassed on to the water-side and had begun undressing on the grass. For\r\na moment it had a suspicious look of suicide, arranged to counterfeit\r\naccident. \xe2\x80\x98But you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have fetched a bundle under your arm, from\r\namong that timber, if such was your game!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. Nevertheless\r\nit was a relief to him when the bather after a plunge and a few strokes\r\ncame out. \xe2\x80\x98For I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a feeling manner, \xe2\x80\x98have liked to\r\nlose you till I had made more money out of you neither.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nProne in another ditch (he had changed his ditch as his man had changed\r\nhis position), and holding apart so small a patch of the hedge that the\r\nsharpest eyes could not have detected him, Rogue Riderhood watched the\r\nbather dressing. And now gradually came the wonder that he stood up,\r\ncompletely clothed, another man, and not the Bargeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Much as you was dressed that night. I see.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a taking me with you, now. You\xe2\x80\x99re deep. But I knows a deeper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the bather had finished dressing, he kneeled on the grass, doing\r\nsomething with his hands, and again stood up with his bundle under his\r\narm. Looking all around him with great attention, he then went to the\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and flung it in as far, and yet as lightly as he could. It\r\nwas not until he was so decidedly upon his way again as to be beyond a\r\nbend of the river and for the time out of view, that Riderhood scrambled\r\nfrom the ditch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 was his debate with himself \xe2\x80\x98shall I foller you on, or shall I\r\nlet you loose for this once, and go a fishing?\xe2\x80\x99 The debate continuing,\r\nhe followed, as a precautionary measure in any case, and got him again\r\nin sight. \xe2\x80\x98If I was to let you loose this once,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood then,\r\nstill following, \xe2\x80\x98I could make you come to me agin, or I could find\r\nyou out in one way or another. If I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to go a fishing, others\r\nmight.--I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you loose this once, and go a fishing!\xe2\x80\x99 With that, he\r\nsuddenly dropped the pursuit and turned.\r\n\r\nThe miserable man whom he had released for the time, but not for long,\r\nwent on towards London. Bradley was suspicious of every sound he heard,\r\nand of every face he saw, but was under a spell which very commonly\r\nfalls upon the shedder of blood, and had no suspicion of the real danger\r\nthat lurked in his life, and would have it yet. Riderhood was much\r\nin his thoughts--had never been out of his thoughts since the\r\nnight-adventure of their first meeting; but Riderhood occupied a very\r\ndifferent place there, from the place of pursuer; and Bradley had been\r\nat the pains of devising so many means of fitting that place to him, and\r\nof wedging him into it, that his mind could not compass the possibility\r\nof his occupying any other. And this is another spell against which\r\nthe shedder of blood for ever strives in vain. There are fifty doors by\r\nwhich discovery may enter. With infinite pains and cunning, he double\r\nlocks and bars forty-nine of them, and cannot see the fiftieth standing\r\nwide open.\r\n\r\nNow, too, was he cursed with a state of mind more wearing and more\r\nwearisome than remorse. He had no remorse; but the evildoer who can hold\r\nthat avenger at bay, cannot escape the slower torture of incessantly\r\ndoing the evil deed again and doing it more efficiently. In the\r\ndefensive declarations and pretended confessions of murderers, the\r\npursuing shadow of this torture may be traced through every lie they\r\ntell. If I had done it as alleged, is it conceivable that I would have\r\nmade this and this mistake? If I had done it as alleged, should I have\r\nleft that unguarded place which that false and wicked witness against me\r\nso infamously deposed to? The state of that wretch who continually finds\r\nthe weak spots in his own crime, and strives to strengthen them when\r\nit is unchangeable, is a state that aggravates the offence by doing\r\nthe deed a thousand times instead of once; but it is a state, too, that\r\ntauntingly visits the offence upon a sullen unrepentant nature with its\r\nheaviest punishment every time.\r\n\r\nBradley toiled on, chained heavily to the idea of his hatred and his\r\nvengeance, and thinking how he might have satiated both in many better\r\nways than the way he had taken. The instrument might have been better,\r\nthe spot and the hour might have been better chosen. To batter a man\r\ndown from behind in the dark, on the brink of a river, was well enough,\r\nbut he ought to have been instantly disabled, whereas he had turned and\r\nseized his assailant; and so, to end it before chance-help came, and\r\nto be rid of him, he had been hurriedly thrown backward into the river\r\nbefore the life was fully beaten out of him. Now if it could be done\r\nagain, it must not be so done. Supposing his head had been held down\r\nunder water for a while. Supposing the first blow had been truer.\r\nSupposing he had been shot. Supposing he had been strangled. Suppose\r\nthis way, that way, the other way. Suppose anything but getting\r\nunchained from the one idea, for that was inexorably impossible.\r\n\r\nThe school reopened next day. The scholars saw little or no change in\r\ntheir master\xe2\x80\x99s face, for it always wore its slowly labouring expression.\r\nBut, as he heard his classes, he was always doing the deed and doing it\r\nbetter. As he paused with his piece of chalk at the black board before\r\nwriting on it, he was thinking of the spot, and whether the water was\r\nnot deeper and the fall straighter, a little higher up, or a little\r\nlower down. He had half a mind to draw a line or two upon the board, and\r\nshow himself what he meant. He was doing it again and improving on\r\nthe manner, at prayers, in his mental arithmetic, all through his\r\nquestioning, all through the day.\r\n\r\nCharley Hexam was a master now, in another school, under another head.\r\nIt was evening, and Bradley was walking in his garden observed from\r\nbehind a blind by gentle little Miss Peecher, who contemplated offering\r\nhim a loan of her smelling salts for headache, when Mary Anne, in\r\nfaithful attendance, held up her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young Mr Hexam, if you please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, coming to see Mr Headstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, Mary Anne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Mary Anne held up her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may speak, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone has beckoned young Mr Hexam into his house, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and he\r\nhas gone in himself without waiting for young Mr Hexam to come up, and\r\nnow HE has gone in too, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and has shut the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With all my heart, Mary Anne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Mary Anne\xe2\x80\x99s telegraphic arm worked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What more, Mary Anne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They must find it rather dull and dark, Miss Peecher, for the parlour\r\nblind\xe2\x80\x99s down, and neither of them pulls it up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no accounting,\xe2\x80\x99 said good Miss Peecher with a little sad sigh\r\nwhich she repressed by laying her hand on her neat methodical boddice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98there is no accounting for tastes, Mary Anne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharley, entering the dark room, stopped short when he saw his old\r\nfriend in its yellow shade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in, Hexam, come in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharley advanced to take the hand that was held out to him; but stopped\r\nagain, short of it. The heavy, bloodshot eyes of the schoolmaster,\r\nrising to his face with an effort, met his look of scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Matter? Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Headstone, have you heard the news? This news about the fellow, Mr\r\nEugene Wrayburn? That he is killed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is dead, then!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Bradley.\r\n\r\nYoung Hexam standing looking at him, he moistened his lips with his\r\ntongue, looked about the room, glanced at his former pupil, and looked\r\ndown. \xe2\x80\x98I heard of the outrage,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, trying to constrain his\r\nworking mouth, \xe2\x80\x98but I had not heard the end of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where were you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, advancing a step as he lowered his\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x98when it was done? Stop! I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. If you\r\nforce your confidence upon me, Mr Headstone, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up every word of\r\nit. Mind! Take notice. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give up you. I will!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wretched creature seemed to suffer acutely under this renunciation.\r\nA desolate air of utter and complete loneliness fell upon him, like a\r\nvisible shade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s for me to speak, not you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy. \xe2\x80\x98If you do, you\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nit at your peril. I am going to put your selfishness before you, Mr\r\nHeadstone--your passionate, violent, and ungovernable selfishness--to\r\nshow you why I can, and why I will, have nothing more to do with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked at young Hexam as if he were waiting for a scholar to go on\r\nwith a lesson that he knew by heart and was deadly tired of. But he had\r\nsaid his last word to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you had any part--I don\xe2\x80\x99t say what--in this attack,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued the\r\nboy; \xe2\x80\x98or if you know anything about it--I don\xe2\x80\x99t say how much--or if you\r\nknow who did it--I go no closer--you did an injury to me that\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nto be forgiven. You know that I took you with me to his chambers in the\r\nTemple when I told him my opinion of him, and made myself responsible\r\nfor my opinion of you. You know that I took you with me when I was\r\nwatching him with a view to recovering my sister and bringing her to her\r\nsenses; you know that I have allowed myself to be mixed up with you, all\r\nthrough this business, in favouring your desire to marry my sister. And\r\nhow do you know that, pursuing the ends of your own violent temper, you\r\nhave not laid me open to suspicion? Is that your gratitude to me, Mr\r\nHeadstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley sat looking steadily before him at the vacant air. As often\r\nas young Hexam stopped, he turned his eyes towards him, as if he were\r\nwaiting for him to go on with the lesson, and get it done. As often as\r\nthe boy resumed, Bradley resumed his fixed face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to be plain with you, Mr Headstone,\xe2\x80\x99 said young Hexam,\r\nshaking his head in a half-threatening manner, \xe2\x80\x98because this is no time\r\nfor affecting not to know things that I do know--except certain things\r\nat which it might not be very safe for you, to hint again. What I mean\r\nis this: if you were a good master, I was a good pupil. I have done you\r\nplenty of credit, and in improving my own reputation I have improved\r\nyours quite as much. Very well then. Starting on equal terms, I want to\r\nput before you how you have shown your gratitude to me, for doing all\r\nI could to further your wishes with reference to my sister. You have\r\ncompromised me by being seen about with me, endeavouring to counteract\r\nthis Mr Eugene Wrayburn. That\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing you have done. If my\r\ncharacter, and my now dropping you, help me out of that, Mr Headstone,\r\nthe deliverance is to be attributed to me, and not to you. No thanks to\r\nyou for it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boy stopping again, he moved his eyes again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going on, Mr Headstone, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid. I am going on to the\r\nend, and I have told you beforehand what the end is. Now, you know my\r\nstory. You are as well aware as I am, that I have had many disadvantages\r\nto leave behind me in life. You have heard me mention my father, and you\r\nare sufficiently acquainted with the fact that the home from which I, as\r\nI may say, escaped, might have been a more creditable one than it was.\r\nMy father died, and then it might have been supposed that my way to\r\nrespectability was pretty clear. No. For then my sister begins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke as confidently, and with as entire an absence of any tell-tale\r\ncolour in his cheek, as if there were no softening old time behind him.\r\nNot wonderful, for there WAS none in his hollow empty heart. What is\r\nthere but self, for selfishness to see behind it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I speak of my sister, I devoutly wish that you had never seen\r\nher, Mr Headstone. However, you did see her, and that\xe2\x80\x99s useless now. I\r\nconfided in you about her. I explained her character to you, and how she\r\ninterposed some ridiculous fanciful notions in the way of our being as\r\nrespectable as I tried for. You fell in love with her, and I favoured\r\nyou with all my might. She could not be induced to favour you, and so\r\nwe came into collision with this Mr Eugene Wrayburn. Now, what have you\r\ndone? Why, you have justified my sister in being firmly set against you\r\nfrom first to last, and you have put me in the wrong again! And why\r\nhave you done it? Because, Mr Headstone, you are in all your passions\r\nso selfish, and so concentrated upon yourself that you have not bestowed\r\none proper thought on me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cool conviction with which the boy took up and held his position,\r\ncould have been derived from no other vice in human nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, actually with tears, \xe2\x80\x98an extraordinary circumstance\r\nattendant on my life, that every effort I make towards perfect\r\nrespectability, is impeded by somebody else through no fault of mine!\r\nNot content with doing what I have put before you, you will drag my name\r\ninto notoriety through dragging my sister\xe2\x80\x99s--which you are pretty sure\r\nto do, if my suspicions have any foundation at all--and the worse you\r\nprove to be, the harder it will be for me to detach myself from being\r\nassociated with you in people\xe2\x80\x99s minds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he had dried his eyes and heaved a sob over his injuries, he began\r\nmoving towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, I have made up my mind that I will become respectable in the\r\nscale of society, and that I will not be dragged down by others. I have\r\ndone with my sister as well as with you. Since she cares so little for\r\nme as to care nothing for undermining my respectability, she shall go\r\nher way and I will go mine. My prospects are very good, and I mean to\r\nfollow them alone. Mr Headstone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say what you have got upon your\r\nconscience, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Whatever lies upon it, I hope you will see\r\nthe justice of keeping wide and clear of me, and will find a consolation\r\nin completely exonerating all but yourself. I hope, before many years\r\nare out, to succeed the master in my present school, and the mistress\r\nbeing a single woman, though some years older than I am, I might even\r\nmarry her. If it is any comfort to you to know what plans I may work out\r\nby keeping myself strictly respectable in the scale of society, these\r\nare the plans at present occurring to me. In conclusion, if you feel a\r\nsense of having injured me, and a desire to make some small reparation,\r\nI hope you will think how respectable you might have been yourself and\r\nwill contemplate your blighted existence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWas it strange that the wretched man should take this heavily to\r\nheart? Perhaps he had taken the boy to heart, first, through some\r\nlong laborious years; perhaps through the same years he had found\r\nhis drudgery lightened by communication with a brighter and more\r\napprehensive spirit than his own; perhaps a family resemblance of face\r\nand voice between the boy and his sister, smote him hard in the gloom\r\nof his fallen state. For whichsoever reason, or for all, he drooped his\r\ndevoted head when the boy was gone, and shrank together on the floor,\r\nand grovelled there, with the palms of his hands tight-clasping his hot\r\ntemples, in unutterable misery, and unrelieved by a single tear.\r\n\r\n\r\nRogue Riderhood had been busy with the river that day. He had fished\r\nwith assiduity on the previous evening, but the light was short, and\r\nhe had fished unsuccessfully. He had fished again that day with better\r\nluck, and had carried his fish home to Plashwater Weir Mill Lock-house,\r\nin a bundle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nA FEW GRAINS OF PEPPER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker went no more to the business-premises of Pubsey\r\nand Co. in St Mary Axe, after chance had disclosed to her (as she\r\nsupposed) the flinty and hypocritical character of Mr Riah. She often\r\nmoralized over her work on the tricks and the manners of that venerable\r\ncheat, but made her little purchases elsewhere, and lived a secluded\r\nlife. After much consultation with herself, she decided not to put\r\nLizzie Hexam on her guard against the old man, arguing that the\r\ndisappointment of finding him out would come upon her quite soon enough.\r\nTherefore, in her communication with her friend by letter, she was\r\nsilent on this theme, and principally dilated on the backslidings of her\r\nbad child, who every day grew worse and worse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You wicked old boy,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Wren would say to him, with a menacing\r\nforefinger, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll force me to run away from you, after all, you will;\r\nand then you\xe2\x80\x99ll shake to bits, and there\xe2\x80\x99ll be nobody to pick up the\r\npieces!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this foreshadowing of a desolate decease, the wicked old boy would\r\nwhine and whimper, and would sit shaking himself into the lowest of low\r\nspirits, until such time as he could shake himself out of the house and\r\nshake another threepennyworth into himself. But dead drunk or dead\r\nsober (he had come to such a pass that he was least alive in the latter\r\nstate), it was always on the conscience of the paralytic scarecrow that\r\nhe had betrayed his sharp parent for sixty threepennyworths of rum,\r\nwhich were all gone, and that her sharpness would infallibly detect his\r\nhaving done it, sooner or later. All things considered therefore, and\r\naddition made of the state of his body to the state of his mind, the bed\r\non which Mr Dolls reposed was a bed of roses from which the flowers\r\nand leaves had entirely faded, leaving him to lie upon the thorns and\r\nstalks.\r\n\r\nOn a certain day, Miss Wren was alone at her work, with the house-door\r\nset open for coolness, and was trolling in a small sweet voice a\r\nmournful little song which might have been the song of the doll she was\r\ndressing, bemoaning the brittleness and meltability of wax, when whom\r\nshould she descry standing on the pavement, looking in at her, but Mr\r\nFledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it was you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, coming up the two steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Wren retorted. \xe2\x80\x98And I thought it was you, young man.\r\nQuite a coincidence. You\xe2\x80\x99re not mistaken, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken. How\r\nclever we are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and how are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am pretty much as usual, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98A very unfortunate\r\nparent, worried out of my life and senses by a very bad child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s small eyes opened so wide that they might have passed for\r\nordinary-sized eyes, as he stared about him for the very young person\r\nwhom he supposed to be in question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you\xe2\x80\x99re not a parent,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98and consequently it\xe2\x80\x99s of no\r\nuse talking to you upon a family subject.--To what am I to attribute the\r\nhonour and favour?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To a wish to improve your acquaintance,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Fledgeby replied.\r\n\r\nMiss Wren, stopping to bite her thread, looked at him very knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We never meet now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby; \xe2\x80\x98do we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, chopping off the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I had a mind,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98to come and have a talk with you\r\nabout our dodging friend, the child of Israel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So HE gave you my address; did he?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I got it out of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, with a stammer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem to see a good deal of him,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Miss Wren, with shrewd\r\ndistrust. \xe2\x80\x98A good deal of him you seem to see, considering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Considering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the dressmaker, bending over the doll on which\r\nher art was being exercised, \xe2\x80\x98done interceding with him yet?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98La! Been interceding with him all this time, and sticking to him\r\nstill?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, busy with her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sticking to him is the word,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\nMiss Wren pursued her occupation with a concentrated air, and asked,\r\nafter an interval of silent industry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you in the army?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, rather flattered by the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Navy?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N--no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. He qualified these two negatives, as if he were\r\nnot absolutely in either service, but was almost in both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you then?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a gentleman, I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 assented Jenny, screwing up her mouth with an appearance of\r\nconviction. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, to be sure! That accounts for your having so much\r\ntime to give to interceding. But only to think how kind and friendly a\r\ngentleman you must be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby found that he was skating round a board marked Dangerous,\r\nand had better cut out a fresh track. \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to the dodgerest\r\nof the dodgers,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s he up to in the case of your friend\r\nthe handsome gal? He must have some object. What\xe2\x80\x99s his object?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cannot undertake to say, sir, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren,\r\ncomposedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He won\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge where she\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby; \xe2\x80\x98and I have\r\na fancy that I should like to have another look at her. Now I know he\r\nknows where she is gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cannot undertake to say, sir, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Wren again rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you know where she is gone,\xe2\x80\x99 hazarded Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cannot undertake to say, sir, really,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren.\r\n\r\nThe quaint little chin met Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s gaze with such a baffling\r\nhitch, that that agreeable gentleman was for some time at a loss how to\r\nresume his fascinating part in the dialogue. At length he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Jenny!--That\xe2\x80\x99s your name, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Probably you don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 was Miss Wren\xe2\x80\x99s cool answer; \xe2\x80\x98because\r\nyou had it on the best authority. Mine, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Miss Jenny! Instead of coming up and being dead, let\xe2\x80\x99s come out and\r\nlook alive. It\xe2\x80\x99ll pay better, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, bestowing\r\nan inveigling twinkle or two upon the dressmaker. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll find it pay\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny, holding out her doll at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, and\r\ncritically contemplating the effect of her art with her scissors on her\r\nlips and her head thrown back, as if her interest lay there, and not in\r\nthe conversation; \xe2\x80\x98perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll explain your meaning, young man, which\r\nis Greek to me.--You must have another touch of blue in your trimming,\r\nmy dear.\xe2\x80\x99 Having addressed the last remark to her fair client, Miss\r\nWren proceeded to snip at some blue fragments that lay before her, among\r\nfragments of all colours, and to thread a needle from a skein of blue\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.--\xe2\x80\x98Are you attending?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am attending, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren, without the slightest\r\nappearance of so doing. \xe2\x80\x98Another touch of blue in your trimming, my\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, rather discouraged by the\r\ncircumstances under which he found himself pursuing the conversation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99re attending--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Light blue, my sweet young lady,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Miss Wren, in a sprightly\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x98being best suited to your fair complexion and your flaxen\r\ncurls.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say, if you\xe2\x80\x99re attending,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99ll pay better in\r\nthis way. It\xe2\x80\x99ll lead in a roundabout manner to your buying damage and\r\nwaste of Pubsey and Co. at a nominal price, or even getting it for\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 thought the dressmaker. \xe2\x80\x98But you are not so roundabout, Little\r\nEyes, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t notice your answering for Pubsey and Co. after all!\r\nLittle Eyes, Little Eyes, you\xe2\x80\x99re too cunning by half.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I take it for granted,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Fledgeby, \xe2\x80\x98that to get the most of\r\nyour materials for nothing would be well worth your while, Miss Jenny?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may take it for granted,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the dressmaker with many knowing\r\nnods, \xe2\x80\x98that it\xe2\x80\x99s always well worth my while to make money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby approvingly, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re answering to a sensible\r\npurpose. Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re coming out and looking alive! So I make so free,\r\nMiss Jenny, as to offer the remark, that you and Judah were too thick\r\ntogether to last. You can\xe2\x80\x99t come to be intimate with such a deep file\r\nas Judah without beginning to see a little way into him, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nFledgeby with a wink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must own,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the dressmaker, with her eyes upon her work,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that we are not good friends at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not good friends at present,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I know all\r\nabout it. I should like to pay off Judah, by not letting him have his\r\nown deep way in everything. In most things he\xe2\x80\x99ll get it by hook or\r\nby crook, but--hang it all!--don\xe2\x80\x99t let him have his own deep way in\r\neverything. That\xe2\x80\x99s too much.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Fledgeby said this with some display of\r\nindignant warmth, as if he was counsel in the cause for Virtue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I prevent his having his own way?\xe2\x80\x99 began the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Deep way, I called it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--His own deep way, in anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98I like to hear you ask it, because\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s looking alive. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I should expect to find in one of your\r\nsagacious understanding. Now, candidly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Jenny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said, now candidly,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Fledgeby explained, a little put out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh-h!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be glad to countermine him, respecting the handsome gal, your\r\nfriend. He means something there. You may depend upon it, Judah means\r\nsomething there. He has a motive, and of course his motive is a dark\r\nmotive. Now, whatever his motive is, it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to his motive\xe2\x80\x99--Mr\r\nFledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s constructive powers were not equal to the avoidance of some\r\ntautology here--\xe2\x80\x98that it should be kept from me, what he has done with\r\nher. So I put it to you, who know: What HAS he done with her? I ask no\r\nmore. And is that asking much, when you understand that it will pay?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Jenny Wren, who had cast her eyes upon the bench again after her\r\nlast interruption, sat looking at it, needle in hand but not working,\r\nfor some moments. She then briskly resumed her work, and said with a\r\nsidelong glance of her eyes and chin at Mr Fledgeby:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where d\xe2\x80\x99ye live?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Albany, Piccadilly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When are you at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Breakfast-time?\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny, in her abruptest and shortest manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No better time in the day,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll look in upon you to-morrow, young man. Those two ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 pointing\r\nto dolls, \xe2\x80\x98have an appointment in Bond Street at ten precisely. When\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped \xe2\x80\x98em there, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive round to you.\xe2\x80\x99 With a weird little\r\nlaugh, Miss Jenny pointed to her crutch-stick as her equipage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is looking alive indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mark you! I promise you nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, dabbing\r\ntwo dabs at him with her needle, as if she put out both his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No no. I understand,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98The damage and waste question\r\nshall be settled first. It shall be made to pay; don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid.\r\nGood-day, Miss Jenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-day, young man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s prepossessing form withdrew itself; and the little\r\ndressmaker, clipping and snipping and stitching, and stitching and\r\nsnipping and clipping, fell to work at a great rate; musing and\r\nmuttering all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Misty, misty, misty. Can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. Little Eyes and the wolf in a\r\nconspiracy? Or Little Eyes and the wolf against one another? Can\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nit out. My poor Lizzie, have they both designs against you, either way?\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. Is Little Eyes Pubsey, and the wolf Co? Can\xe2\x80\x99t make it\r\nout. Pubsey true to Co, and Co to Pubsey? Pubsey false to Co, and Co to\r\nPubsey? Can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. What said Little Eyes? \xe2\x80\x9cNow, candidly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Ah! However the cat jumps, HE\xe2\x80\x99S a liar. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I can make out at\r\npresent; but you may go to bed in the Albany, Piccadilly, with THAT for\r\nyour pillow, young man!\xe2\x80\x99 Thereupon, the little dressmaker again dabbed\r\nout his eyes separately, and making a loop in the air of her thread and\r\ndeftly catching it into a knot with her needle, seemed to bowstring him\r\ninto the bargain.\r\n\r\nFor the terrors undergone by Mr Dolls that evening when his little\r\nparent sat profoundly meditating over her work, and when he imagined\r\nhimself found out, as often as she changed her attitude, or turned her\r\neyes towards him, there is no adequate name. Moreover it was her habit\r\nto shake her head at that wretched old boy whenever she caught his eye\r\nas he shivered and shook. What are popularly called \xe2\x80\x98the trembles\xe2\x80\x99 being\r\nin full force upon him that evening, and likewise what are popularly\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x98the horrors,\xe2\x80\x99 he had a very bad time of it; which was not\r\nmade better by his being so remorseful as frequently to moan \xe2\x80\x98Sixty\r\nthreepennorths.\xe2\x80\x99 This imperfect sentence not being at all intelligible\r\nas a confession, but sounding like a Gargantuan order for a dram,\r\nbrought him into new difficulties by occasioning his parent to pounce\r\nat him in a more than usually snappish manner, and to overwhelm him with\r\nbitter reproaches.\r\n\r\nWhat was a bad time for Mr Dolls, could not fail to be a bad time for\r\nthe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker. However, she was on the alert next morning, and\r\ndrove to Bond Street, and set down the two ladies punctually, and then\r\ndirected her equipage to conduct her to the Albany. Arrived at the\r\ndoorway of the house in which Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s chambers were, she found a\r\nlady standing there in a travelling dress, holding in her hand--of all\r\nthings in the world--a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want some one?\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady in a stern manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going up stairs to Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot do that at this moment. There is a gentleman with him. I am\r\nwaiting for the gentleman. His business with Mr Fledgeby will very soon\r\nbe transacted, and then you can go up. Until the gentleman comes down,\r\nyou must wait here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile speaking, and afterwards, the lady kept watchfully between her and\r\nthe staircase, as if prepared to oppose her going up, by force. The\r\nlady being of a stature to stop her with a hand, and looking mightily\r\ndetermined, the dressmaker stood still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well? Why do you listen?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not listening,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you hear?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the lady, altering her phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it a kind of a spluttering somewhere?\xe2\x80\x99 said the dressmaker, with an\r\ninquiring look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Fledgeby in his shower-bath, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked the lady, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And somebody\xe2\x80\x99s beating a carpet, I think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s carpet, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the smiling lady.\r\n\r\nMiss Wren had a reasonably good eye for smiles, being well accustomed\r\nto them on the part of her young friends, though their smiles mostly ran\r\nsmaller than in nature. But she had never seen so singular a smile\r\nas that upon this lady\xe2\x80\x99s face. It twitched her nostrils open in a\r\nremarkable manner, and contracted her lips and eyebrows. It was a smile\r\nof enjoyment too, though of such a fierce kind that Miss Wren thought\r\nshe would rather not enjoy herself than do it in that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady, watching her. \xe2\x80\x98What now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter!\xe2\x80\x99 said the dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, staring about her. \xe2\x80\x98But I never\r\nheard such odd noises. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think I had better call somebody?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you had better not,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the lady with a significant\r\nfrown, and drawing closer.\r\n\r\nOn this hint, the dressmaker relinquished the idea, and stood looking\r\nat the lady as hard as the lady looked at her. Meanwhile the dressmaker\r\nlistened with amazement to the odd noises which still continued, and the\r\nlady listened too, but with a coolness in which there was no trace of\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, came a slamming and banging of doors; and then came\r\nrunning down stairs, a gentleman with whiskers, and out of breath, who\r\nseemed to be red-hot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is your business done, Alfred?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very thoroughly done,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the gentleman, as he took his hat from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can go up to Mr Fledgeby as soon as you like,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady,\r\nmoving haughtily away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! And you can take these three pieces of stick with you,\xe2\x80\x99 added the\r\ngentleman politely, \xe2\x80\x98and say, if you please, that they come from Mr\r\nAlfred Lammle, with his compliments on leaving England. Mr Alfred\r\nLammle. Be so good as not to forget the name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe three pieces of stick were three broken and frayed fragments of a\r\nstout lithe cane. Miss Jenny taking them wonderingly, and the gentleman\r\nrepeating with a grin, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Alfred Lammle, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so good.\r\nCompliments, on leaving England,\xe2\x80\x99 the lady and gentleman walked away\r\nquite deliberately, and Miss Jenny and her crutch-stick went up stairs.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lammle, Lammle, Lammle?\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Jenny repeated as she panted from stair\r\nto stair, \xe2\x80\x98where have I heard that name? Lammle, Lammle? I know! Saint\r\nMary Axe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a gleam of new intelligence in her sharp face, the dolls\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndressmaker pulled at Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s bell. No one answered; but, from within\r\nthe chambers, there proceeded a continuous spluttering sound of a highly\r\nsingular and unintelligible nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good gracious! Is Little Eyes choking?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Jenny.\r\n\r\nPulling at the bell again and getting no reply, she pushed the outer\r\ndoor, and found it standing ajar. No one being visible on her opening it\r\nwider, and the spluttering continuing, she took the liberty of opening\r\nan inner door, and then beheld the extraordinary spectacle of Mr\r\nFledgeby in a shirt, a pair of Turkish trousers, and a Turkish cap,\r\nrolling over and over on his own carpet, and spluttering wonderfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh Lord!\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Mr Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Oh my eye! Stop thief! I am strangling.\r\nFire! Oh my eye! A glass of water. Give me a glass of water. Shut the\r\ndoor. Murder! Oh Lord!\xe2\x80\x99 And then rolled and spluttered more than ever.\r\n\r\nHurrying into another room, Miss Jenny got a glass of water, and brought\r\nit for Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s relief: who, gasping, spluttering, and rattling in his\r\nthroat betweenwhiles, drank some water, and laid his head faintly on her\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my eye!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby, struggling anew. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s salt and snuff. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nup my nose, and down my throat, and in my wind-pipe. Ugh! Ow! Ow! Ow!\r\nAh--h--h--h!\xe2\x80\x99 And here, crowing fearfully, with his eyes starting out of\r\nhis head, appeared to be contending with every mortal disease incidental\r\nto poultry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Oh my Eye, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sore!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby, starting, over on his\r\nback, in a spasmodic way that caused the dressmaker to retreat to the\r\nwall. \xe2\x80\x98Oh I smart so! Do put something to my back and arms, and legs and\r\nshoulders. Ugh! It\xe2\x80\x99s down my throat again and can\xe2\x80\x99t come up. Ow! Ow! Ow!\r\nAh--h--h--h! Oh I smart so!\xe2\x80\x99 Here Mr Fledgeby bounded up, and bounded\r\ndown, and went rolling over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker looked on until he rolled himself into a corner\r\nwith his Turkish slippers uppermost, and then, resolving in the first\r\nplace to address her ministration to the salt and snuff, gave him more\r\nwater and slapped his back. But, the latter application was by no means\r\na success, causing Mr Fledgeby to scream, and to cry out, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my eye!\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t slap me! I\xe2\x80\x99m covered with weales and I smart so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, he gradually ceased to choke and crow, saving at intervals,\r\nand Miss Jenny got him into an easy-chair: where, with his eyes red and\r\nwatery, with his features swollen, and with some half-dozen livid bars\r\nacross his face, he presented a most rueful sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What ever possessed you to take salt and snuff, young man?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired\r\nMiss Jenny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it,\xe2\x80\x99 the dismal youth replied. \xe2\x80\x98It was crammed into my\r\nmouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who crammed it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Jenny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98The assassin. Lammle. He rubbed it into\r\nmy mouth and up my nose and down my throat--Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah--h--h--h!\r\nUgh!--to prevent my crying out, and then cruelly assaulted me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With this?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Jenny, showing the pieces of cane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the weapon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Fledgeby, eyeing it with the air of an\r\nacquaintance. \xe2\x80\x98He broke it over me. Oh I smart so! How did you come by\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he ran down stairs and joined the lady he had left in the hall\r\nwith his hat\xe2\x80\x99--Miss Jenny began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 groaned Mr Fledgeby, writhing, \xe2\x80\x98she was holding his hat, was she?\r\nI might have known she was in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When he came down stairs and joined the lady who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me come\r\nup, he gave me the pieces for you, and I was to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWith Mr Alfred\r\nLammle\xe2\x80\x99s compliments on his leaving England.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Jenny said it with\r\nsuch spiteful satisfaction, and such a hitch of her chin and eyes as\r\nmight have added to Mr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s miseries, if he could have noticed\r\neither, in his bodily pain with his hand to his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I go for the police?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Miss Jenny, with a nimble start\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop! No, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, please. We had better keep it\r\nquiet. Will you be so good as shut the door? Oh I do smart so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn testimony of the extent to which he smarted, Mr Fledgeby came\r\nwallowing out of the easy-chair, and took another roll on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now the door\xe2\x80\x99s shut,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Fledgeby, sitting up in anguish, with\r\nhis Turkish cap half on and half off, and the bars on his face getting\r\nbluer, \xe2\x80\x98do me the kindness to look at my back and shoulders. They must\r\nbe in an awful state, for I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got my dressing-gown on, when the\r\nbrute came rushing in. Cut my shirt away from the collar; there\xe2\x80\x99s a pair\r\nof scissors on that table. Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 groaned Mr Fledgeby, with his hand to\r\nhis head again. \xe2\x80\x98How I do smart, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Miss Jenny, alluding to the back and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh Lord, yes!\xe2\x80\x99 moaned Fledgeby, rocking himself. \xe2\x80\x98And all over!\r\nEverywhere!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe busy little dressmaker quickly snipped the shirt away, and laid\r\nbare the results of as furious and sound a thrashing as even Mr Fledgeby\r\nmerited. \xe2\x80\x98You may well smart, young man!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Jenny. And\r\nstealthily rubbed her little hands behind him, and poked a few exultant\r\npokes with her two forefingers over the crown of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of vinegar and brown paper?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the suffering\r\nFledgeby, still rocking and moaning. \xe2\x80\x98Does it look as if vinegar and\r\nbrown paper was the sort of application?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny, with a silent chuckle. \xe2\x80\x98It looks as if it ought\r\nto be Pickled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby collapsed under the word \xe2\x80\x98Pickled,\xe2\x80\x99 and groaned again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My kitchen is on this floor,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll find brown paper in a\r\ndresser-drawer there, and a bottle of vinegar on a shelf. Would you have\r\nthe kindness to make a few plasters and put \xe2\x80\x98em on? It can\xe2\x80\x99t be kept too\r\nquiet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One, two--hum--five, six. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want six,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dress-maker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s smart enough,\xe2\x80\x99 whimpered Mr Fledgeby, groaning and writhing\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x98for sixty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Jenny repaired to the kitchen, scissors in hand, found the brown\r\npaper and found the vinegar, and skilfully cut out and steeped six\r\nlarge plasters. When they were all lying ready on the dresser, an idea\r\noccurred to her as she was about to gather them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny with a silent laugh, \xe2\x80\x98he ought to have a\r\nlittle pepper? Just a few grains? I think the young man\xe2\x80\x99s tricks and\r\nmanners make a claim upon his friends for a little pepper?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Fledgeby\xe2\x80\x99s evil star showing her the pepper-box on the chimneypiece,\r\nshe climbed upon a chair, and got it down, and sprinkled all the\r\nplasters with a judicious hand. She then went back to Mr Fledgeby, and\r\nstuck them all on him: Mr Fledgeby uttering a sharp howl as each was put\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, young man!\xe2\x80\x99 said the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker. \xe2\x80\x98Now I hope you feel\r\npretty comfortable?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nApparently, Mr Fledgeby did not, for he cried by way of answer, \xe2\x80\x98Oh--h\r\nhow I do smart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Jenny got his Persian gown upon him, extinguished his eyes\r\ncrookedly with his Persian cap, and helped him to his bed: upon which he\r\nclimbed groaning. \xe2\x80\x98Business between you and me being out of the question\r\nto-day, young man, and my time being precious,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny then,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll make myself scarce. Are you comfortable now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh my eye!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Fledgeby. \xe2\x80\x98No, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Oh--h--h! how I do smart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe last thing Miss Jenny saw, as she looked back before closing the\r\nroom door, was Mr Fledgeby in the act of plunging and gambolling all\r\nover his bed, like a porpoise or dolphin in its native element. She then\r\nshut the bedroom door, and all the other doors, and going down stairs\r\nand emerging from the Albany into the busy streets, took omnibus for\r\nSaint Mary Axe: pressing on the road all the gaily-dressed ladies whom\r\nshe could see from the window, and making them unconscious lay-figures\r\nfor dolls, while she mentally cut them out and basted them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nTWO PLACES VACATED\r\n\r\n\r\nSet down by the omnibus at the corner of Saint Mary Axe, and trusting\r\nto her feet and her crutch-stick within its precincts, the dolls\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndressmaker proceeded to the place of business of Pubsey and Co. All\r\nthere was sunny and quiet externally, and shady and quiet internally.\r\nHiding herself in the entry outside the glass door, she could see from\r\nthat post of observation the old man in his spectacles sitting writing\r\nat his desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the dressmaker, popping in her head at the glass-door. \xe2\x80\x98Mr\r\nWolf at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man took his glasses off, and mildly laid them down beside him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah Jenny, is it you? I thought you had given me up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so I had given up the treacherous wolf of the forest,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but, godmother, it strikes me you have come back. I am not quite sure,\r\nbecause the wolf and you change forms. I want to ask you a question or\r\ntwo, to find out whether you are really godmother or really wolf. May\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Jenny, yes.\xe2\x80\x99 But Riah glanced towards the door, as if he thought\r\nhis principal might appear there, unseasonably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of the fox,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny, \xe2\x80\x98you may dismiss all\r\npresent expectations of seeing that animal. HE won\xe2\x80\x99t show himself\r\nabroad, for many a day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, my child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean, godmother,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren, sitting down beside the Jew,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that the fox has caught a famous flogging, and that if his skin and\r\nbones are not tingling, aching, and smarting at this present instant, no\r\nfox did ever tingle, ache, and smart.\xe2\x80\x99 Therewith Miss Jenny related what\r\nhad come to pass in the Albany, omitting the few grains of pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, godmother,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, \xe2\x80\x98I particularly wish to ask you what has\r\ntaken place here, since I left the wolf here? Because I have an idea\r\nabout the size of a marble, rolling about in my little noddle. First and\r\nforemost, are you Pubsey and Co., or are you either? Upon your solemn\r\nword and honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Secondly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t Fledgeby both Pubsey and Co.?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old man answered with a reluctant nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My idea,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98is now about the size of an orange. But\r\nbefore it gets any bigger, welcome back, dear godmother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little creature folded her arms about the old man\xe2\x80\x99s neck with great\r\nearnestness, and kissed him. \xe2\x80\x98I humbly beg your forgiveness, godmother.\r\nI am truly sorry. I ought to have had more faith in you. But what could\r\nI suppose when you said nothing for yourself, you know? I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\noffer that as a justification, but what could I suppose, when you were a\r\nsilent party to all he said? It did look bad; now didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It looked so bad, Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 responded the old man, with gravity, \xe2\x80\x98that I\r\nwill straightway tell you what an impression it wrought upon me. I was\r\nhateful in mine own eyes. I was hateful to myself, in being so hateful\r\nto the debtor and to you. But more than that, and worse than that,\r\nand to pass out far and broad beyond myself--I reflected that evening,\r\nsitting alone in my garden on the housetop, that I was doing dishonour\r\nto my ancient faith and race. I reflected--clearly reflected for the\r\nfirst time--that in bending my neck to the yoke I was willing to wear,\r\nI bent the unwilling necks of the whole Jewish people. For it is not, in\r\nChristian countries, with the Jews as with other peoples. Men say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nis a bad Greek, but there are good Greeks. This is a bad Turk, but there\r\nare good Turks.\xe2\x80\x9d Not so with the Jews. Men find the bad among us easily\r\nenough--among what peoples are the bad not easily found?--but they take\r\nthe worst of us as samples of the best; they take the lowest of us as\r\npresentations of the highest; and they say \xe2\x80\x9cAll Jews are alike.\xe2\x80\x9d If,\r\ndoing what I was content to do here, because I was grateful for the past\r\nand have small need of money now, I had been a Christian, I could have\r\ndone it, compromising no one but my individual self. But doing it as a\r\nJew, I could not choose but compromise the Jews of all conditions and\r\nall countries. It is a little hard upon us, but it is the truth. I would\r\nthat all our people remembered it! Though I have little right to say so,\r\nseeing that it came home so late to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker sat holding the old man by the hand, and looking\r\nthoughtfully in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thus I reflected, I say, sitting that evening in my garden on the\r\nhousetop. And passing the painful scene of that day in review before\r\nme many times, I always saw that the poor gentleman believed the story\r\nreadily, because I was one of the Jews--that you believed the story\r\nreadily, my child, because I was one of the Jews--that the story itself\r\nfirst came into the invention of the originator thereof, because I was\r\none of the Jews. This was the result of my having had you three before\r\nme, face to face, and seeing the thing visibly presented as upon a\r\ntheatre. Wherefore I perceived that the obligation was upon me to leave\r\nthis service. But Jenny, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riah, breaking off, \xe2\x80\x98I promised\r\nthat you should pursue your questions, and I obstruct them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On the contrary, godmother; my idea is as large now as a pumpkin--and\r\nYOU know what a pumpkin is, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? So you gave notice that you\r\nwere going? Does that come next?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Jenny with a look of close\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I indited a letter to my master. Yes. To that effect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what said Tingling-Tossing-Aching-Screaming-Scratching-Smarter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked Miss Wren with an unspeakable enjoyment in the utterance of those\r\nhonourable titles and in the recollection of the pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He held me to certain months of servitude, which were his lawful term\r\nof notice. They expire to-morrow. Upon their expiration--not before--I\r\nhad meant to set myself right with my Cinderella.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My idea is getting so immense now,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Wren, clasping her\r\ntemples, \xe2\x80\x98that my head won\xe2\x80\x99t hold it! Listen, godmother; I am going to\r\nexpound. Little Eyes (that\xe2\x80\x99s Screaming-Scratching-Smarter) owes you a\r\nheavy grudge for going. Little Eyes casts about how best to pay you off.\r\nLittle Eyes thinks of Lizzie. Little Eyes says to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nout where he has placed that girl, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll betray his secret because\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s dear to him.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps Little Eyes thinks, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make love to her\r\nmyself too;\xe2\x80\x9d but that I can\xe2\x80\x99t swear--all the rest I can. So, Little Eyes\r\ncomes to me, and I go to Little Eyes. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way of it. And now the\r\nmurder\xe2\x80\x99s all out, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 added the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, rigid from\r\nhead to foot with energy as she shook her little fist before her eyes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him Cayenne pepper and chopped pickled Capsicum!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis expression of regret being but partially intelligible to Mr Riah,\r\nthe old man reverted to the injuries Fledgeby had received, and hinted\r\nat the necessity of his at once going to tend that beaten cur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Godmother, godmother, godmother!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Wren irritably, \xe2\x80\x98I really\r\nlose all patience with you. One would think you believed in the Good\r\nSamaritan. How can you be so inconsistent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jenny dear,\xe2\x80\x99 began the old man gently, \xe2\x80\x98it is the custom of our people\r\nto help--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Bother your people!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Miss Wren, with a toss of her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If your people don\xe2\x80\x99t know better than to go and help Little Eyes, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na pity they ever got out of Egypt. Over and above that,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, \xe2\x80\x98he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take your help if you offered it. Too much ashamed. Wants to\r\nkeep it close and quiet, and to keep you out of the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were still debating this point when a shadow darkened the entry,\r\nand the glass door was opened by a messenger who brought a letter\r\nunceremoniously addressed, \xe2\x80\x98Riah.\xe2\x80\x99 To which he said there was an answer\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nThe letter, which was scrawled in pencil uphill and downhill and round\r\ncrooked corners, ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98OLD RIAH,\r\n\r\nYour accounts being all squared, go. Shut up the place, turn out\r\ndirectly, and send me the key by bearer. Go. You are an unthankful dog\r\nof a Jew. Get out.\r\n\r\nF.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker found it delicious to trace the screaming and\r\nsmarting of Little Eyes in the distorted writing of this epistle. She\r\nlaughed over it and jeered at it in a convenient corner (to the great\r\nastonishment of the messenger) while the old man got his few goods\r\ntogether in a black bag. That done, the shutters of the upper windows\r\nclosed, and the office blind pulled down, they issued forth upon the\r\nsteps with the attendant messenger. There, while Miss Jenny held the\r\nbag, the old man locked the house door, and handed over the key to him;\r\nwho at once retired with the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, godmother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, as they remained upon the steps\r\ntogether, looking at one another. \xe2\x80\x98And so you\xe2\x80\x99re thrown upon the world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would appear so, Jenny, and somewhat suddenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are you going to seek your fortune?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Wren.\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled, but looked about him with a look of having lost his\r\nway in life, which did not escape the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Verily, Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98the question is to the purpose, and more\r\neasily asked than answered. But as I have experience of the ready\r\ngoodwill and good help of those who have given occupation to Lizzie, I\r\nthink I will seek them out for myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On foot?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Wren, with a chop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man. \xe2\x80\x98Have I not my staff?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was exactly because he had his staff, and presented so quaint an\r\naspect, that she mistrusted his making the journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best thing you can do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny, \xe2\x80\x98for the time being, at all\r\nevents, is to come home with me, godmother. Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s there but my bad\r\nchild, and Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s lodging stands empty.\xe2\x80\x99 The old man when satisfied\r\nthat no inconvenience could be entailed on any one by his compliance,\r\nreadily complied; and the singularly-assorted couple once more went\r\nthrough the streets together.\r\n\r\nNow, the bad child having been strictly charged by his parent to remain\r\nat home in her absence, of course went out; and, being in the very last\r\nstage of mental decrepitude, went out with two objects; firstly,\r\nto establish a claim he conceived himself to have upon any licensed\r\nvictualler living, to be supplied with threepennyworth of rum for\r\nnothing; and secondly, to bestow some maudlin remorse on Mr Eugene\r\nWrayburn, and see what profit came of it. Stumblingly pursuing these\r\ntwo designs--they both meant rum, the only meaning of which he was\r\ncapable--the degraded creature staggered into Covent Garden Market and\r\nthere bivouacked, to have an attack of the trembles succeeded by an\r\nattack of the horrors, in a doorway.\r\n\r\nThis market of Covent Garden was quite out of the creature\xe2\x80\x99s line of\r\nroad, but it had the attraction for him which it has for the worst of\r\nthe solitary members of the drunken tribe. It may be the companionship\r\nof the nightly stir, or it may be the companionship of the gin and\r\nbeer that slop about among carters and hucksters, or it may be the\r\ncompanionship of the trodden vegetable refuse which is so like their own\r\ndress that perhaps they take the Market for a great wardrobe; but be\r\nit what it may, you shall see no such individual drunkards on doorsteps\r\nanywhere, as there. Of dozing women-drunkards especially, you shall come\r\nupon such specimens there, in the morning sunlight, as you might\r\nseek out of doors in vain through London. Such stale vapid rejected\r\ncabbage-leaf and cabbage-stalk dress, such damaged-orange countenance,\r\nsuch squashed pulp of humanity, are open to the day nowhere else. So,\r\nthe attraction of the Market drew Mr Dolls to it, and he had out his two\r\nfits of trembles and horrors in a doorway on which a woman had had out\r\nher sodden nap a few hours before.\r\n\r\nThere is a swarm of young savages always flitting about this same place,\r\ncreeping off with fragments of orange-chests, and mouldy litter--Heaven\r\nknows into what holes they can convey them, having no home!--whose bare\r\nfeet fall with a blunt dull softness on the pavement as the policeman\r\nhunts them, and who are (perhaps for that reason) little heard by\r\nthe Powers that be, whereas in top-boots they would make a deafening\r\nclatter. These, delighting in the trembles and the horrors of Mr Dolls,\r\nas in a gratuitous drama, flocked about him in his doorway, butted\r\nat him, leaped at him, and pelted him. Hence, when he came out of\r\nhis invalid retirement and shook off that ragged train, he was much\r\nbespattered, and in worse case than ever. But, not yet at his worst;\r\nfor, going into a public-house, and being supplied in stress of business\r\nwith his rum, and seeking to vanish without payment, he was collared,\r\nsearched, found penniless, and admonished not to try that again,\r\nby having a pail of dirty water cast over him. This application\r\nsuperinduced another fit of the trembles; after which Mr Dolls, as\r\nfinding himself in good cue for making a call on a professional friend,\r\naddressed himself to the Temple.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody at the chambers but Young Blight. That discreet youth,\r\nsensible of a certain incongruity in the association of such a\r\nclient with the business that might be coming some day, with the best\r\nintentions temporized with Dolls, and offered a shilling for coach-hire\r\nhome. Mr Dolls, accepting the shilling, promptly laid it out in\r\ntwo threepennyworths of conspiracy against his life, and two\r\nthreepennyworths of raging repentance. Returning to the Chambers with\r\nwhich burden, he was descried coming round into the court, by the wary\r\nyoung Blight watching from the window: who instantly closed the outer\r\ndoor, and left the miserable object to expend his fury on the panels.\r\n\r\nThe more the door resisted him, the more dangerous and imminent became\r\nthat bloody conspiracy against his life. Force of police arriving,\r\nhe recognized in them the conspirators, and laid about him hoarsely,\r\nfiercely, staringly, convulsively, foamingly. A humble machine, familiar\r\nto the conspirators and called by the expressive name of Stretcher,\r\nbeing unavoidably sent for, he was rendered a harmless bundle of torn\r\nrags by being strapped down upon it, with voice and consciousness gone\r\nout of him, and life fast going. As this machine was borne out at the\r\nTemple gate by four men, the poor little dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker and her\r\nJewish friend were coming up the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let us see what it is,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the dressmaker. \xe2\x80\x98Let us make haste and\r\nlook, godmother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe brisk little crutch-stick was but too brisk. \xe2\x80\x98O gentlemen,\r\ngentlemen, he belongs to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Belongs to you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the head of the party, stopping it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, dear gentlemen, he\xe2\x80\x99s my child, out without leave. My poor bad,\r\nbad boy! and he don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, he don\xe2\x80\x99t know me! O what shall I do,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried the little creature, wildly beating her hands together, \xe2\x80\x98when my\r\nown child don\xe2\x80\x99t know me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe head of the party looked (as well he might) to the old man for\r\nexplanation. He whispered, as the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker bent over the\r\nexhausted form and vainly tried to extract some sign of recognition from\r\nit: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s her drunken father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs the load was put down in the street, Riah drew the head of the party\r\naside, and whispered that he thought the man was dying. \xe2\x80\x98No, surely\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the other. But he became less confident, on looking, and\r\ndirected the bearers to \xe2\x80\x98bring him to the nearest doctor\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThither he was brought; the window becoming from within, a wall of\r\nfaces, deformed into all kinds of shapes through the agency of globular\r\nred bottles, green bottles, blue bottles, and other coloured bottles. A\r\nghastly light shining upon him that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t need, the beast so furious\r\nbut a few minutes gone, was quiet enough now, with a strange mysterious\r\nwriting on his face, reflected from one of the great bottles, as if\r\nDeath had marked him: \xe2\x80\x98Mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe medical testimony was more precise and more to the purpose than it\r\nsometimes is in a Court of Justice. \xe2\x80\x98You had better send for something\r\nto cover it. All\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTherefore, the police sent for something to cover it, and it was covered\r\nand borne through the streets, the people falling away. After it,\r\nwent the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, hiding her face in the Jewish skirts, and\r\nclinging to them with one hand, while with the other she plied her\r\nstick. It was carried home, and, by reason that the staircase was very\r\nnarrow, it was put down in the parlour--the little working-bench being\r\nset aside to make room for it--and there, in the midst of the dolls with\r\nno speculation in their eyes, lay Mr Dolls with no speculation in his.\r\n\r\nMany flaunting dolls had to be gaily dressed, before the money was in\r\nthe dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s pocket to get mourning for Mr Dolls. As the old man,\r\nRiah, sat by, helping her in such small ways as he could, he found it\r\ndifficult to make out whether she really did realize that the deceased\r\nhad been her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If my poor boy,\xe2\x80\x99 she would say, \xe2\x80\x98had been brought up better, he might\r\nhave done better. Not that I reproach myself. I hope I have no cause for\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None indeed, Jenny, I am very certain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, godmother. It cheers me to hear you say so. But you see it\r\nis so hard to bring up a child well, when you work, work, work, all day.\r\nWhen he was out of employment, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t always keep him near me. He\r\ngot fractious and nervous, and I was obliged to let him go into the\r\nstreets. And he never did well in the streets, he never did well out of\r\nsight. How often it happens with children!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too often, even in this sad sense!\xe2\x80\x99 thought the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can I say what I might have turned out myself, but for my back\r\nhaving been so bad and my legs so queer, when I was young!\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\ndressmaker would go on. \xe2\x80\x98I had nothing to do but work, and so I worked.\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play. But my poor unfortunate child could play, and it turned\r\nout the worse for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And not for him alone, Jenny.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, godmother. He suffered heavily, did my unfortunate\r\nboy. He was very, very ill sometimes. And I called him a quantity of\r\nnames;\xe2\x80\x99 shaking her head over her work, and dropping tears. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that his going wrong was much the worse for me. If it ever was, let\r\nus forget it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a good girl, you are a patient girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As for patience,\xe2\x80\x99 she would reply with a shrug, \xe2\x80\x98not much of that,\r\ngodmother. If I had been patient, I should never have called him names.\r\nBut I hope I did it for his good. And besides, I felt my responsibility\r\nas a mother, so much. I tried reasoning, and reasoning failed. I tried\r\ncoaxing, and coaxing failed. I tried scolding and scolding failed. But I\r\nwas bound to try everything, you know, with such a charge upon my hands.\r\nWhere would have been my duty to my poor lost boy, if I had not tried\r\neverything!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith such talk, mostly in a cheerful tone on the part of the industrious\r\nlittle creature, the day-work and the night-work were beguiled until\r\nenough of smart dolls had gone forth to bring into the kitchen,\r\nwhere the working-bench now stood, the sombre stuff that the occasion\r\nrequired, and to bring into the house the other sombre preparations.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny, \xe2\x80\x98having knocked off my rosy-cheeked young\r\nfriends, I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock off my white-cheeked self.\xe2\x80\x99 This referred to her\r\nmaking her own dress, which at last was done. \xe2\x80\x98The disadvantage of\r\nmaking for yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny, as she stood upon a chair to look\r\nat the result in the glass, \xe2\x80\x98is, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t charge anybody else for\r\nthe job, and the advantage is, that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t to go out to try on.\r\nHumph! Very fair indeed! If He could see me now (whoever he is) I hope\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t repent of his bargain!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe simple arrangements were of her own making, and were stated to Riah\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean to go alone, godmother, in my usual carriage, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so\r\nkind as keep house while I am gone. It\xe2\x80\x99s not far off. And when I return,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a cup of tea, and a chat over future arrangements. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvery plain last house that I have been able to give my poor unfortunate\r\nboy; but he\xe2\x80\x99ll accept the will for the deed if he knows anything about\r\nit; and if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x99 with a sob, and wiping\r\nher eyes, \xe2\x80\x98why, it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter to him. I see the service in the\r\nPrayer-book says, that we brought nothing into this world and it is\r\ncertain we can take nothing out. It comforts me for not being able to\r\nhire a lot of stupid undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s things for my poor child, and seeming\r\nas if I was trying to smuggle \xe2\x80\x98em out of this world with him, when of\r\ncourse I must break down in the attempt, and bring \xe2\x80\x98em all back again.\r\nAs it is, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be nothing to bring back but me, and that\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nconsistent, for I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be brought back, some day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter that previous carrying of him in the streets, the wretched old\r\nfellow seemed to be twice buried. He was taken on the shoulders of half\r\na dozen blossom-faced men, who shuffled with him to the churchyard,\r\nand who were preceded by another blossom-faced man, affecting a\r\nstately stalk, as if he were a Policeman of the D(eath) Division, and\r\nceremoniously pretending not to know his intimate acquaintances, as he\r\nled the pageant. Yet, the spectacle of only one little mourner hobbling\r\nafter, caused many people to turn their heads with a look of interest.\r\n\r\nAt last the troublesome deceased was got into the ground, to be buried\r\nno more, and the stately stalker stalked back before the solitary\r\ndressmaker, as if she were bound in honour to have no notion of the way\r\nhome. Those Furies, the conventionalities, being thus appeased, he left\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must have a very short cry, godmother, before I cheer up for good,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the little creature, coming in. \xe2\x80\x98Because after all a child is a\r\nchild, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a longer cry than might have been expected. Howbeit, it wore\r\nitself out in a shadowy corner, and then the dressmaker came forth, and\r\nwashed her face, and made the tea. \xe2\x80\x98You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind my cutting out\r\nsomething while we are at tea, would you?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked her Jewish friend,\r\nwith a coaxing air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cinderella, dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 the old man expostulated, \xe2\x80\x98will you never\r\nrest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s not work, cutting out a pattern isn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Jenny, with\r\nher busy little scissors already snipping at some paper. \xe2\x80\x98The truth is,\r\ngodmother, I want to fix it while I have it correct in my mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you seen it to-day then?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, godmother. Saw it just now. It\xe2\x80\x99s a surplice, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it\r\nis. Thing our clergymen wear, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 explained Miss Jenny, in\r\nconsideration of his professing another faith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what have you to do with that, Jenny?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, godmother,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the dressmaker, \xe2\x80\x98you must know that we\r\nProfessors who live upon our taste and invention, are obliged to keep\r\nour eyes always open. And you know already that I have many extra\r\nexpenses to meet just now. So, it came into my head while I was weeping\r\nat my poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s grave, that something in my way might be done with a\r\nclergyman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What can be done?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a funeral, never fear!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Jenny, anticipating his\r\nobjection with a nod. \xe2\x80\x98The public don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be made melancholy, I\r\nknow very well. I am seldom called upon to put my young friends into\r\nmourning; not into real mourning, that is; Court mourning they are\r\nrather proud of. But a doll clergyman, my dear,--glossy black curls\r\nand whiskers--uniting two of my young friends in matrimony,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss\r\nJenny, shaking her forefinger, \xe2\x80\x98is quite another affair. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee those three at the altar in Bond Street, in a jiffy, my name\xe2\x80\x99s Jack\r\nRobinson!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith her expert little ways in sharp action, she had got a doll into\r\nwhitey-brown paper orders, before the meal was over, and was displaying\r\nit for the edification of the Jewish mind, when a knock was heard at the\r\nstreet-door. Riah went to open it, and presently came back, ushering in,\r\nwith the grave and courteous air that sat so well upon him, a gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman was a stranger to the dressmaker; but even in the moment\r\nof his casting his eyes upon her, there was something in his manner\r\nwhich brought to her remembrance Mr Eugene Wrayburn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x98You are the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s friend?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Jenny, instantly on the defensive. \xe2\x80\x98And Lizzie\r\nHexam\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is a note from her, entreating you to accede to the request of\r\nMr Mortimer Lightwood, the bearer. Mr Riah chances to know that I am Mr\r\nMortimer Lightwood, and will tell you so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiah bent his head in corroboration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you read the note?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s very short,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jenny, with a look of wonder, when she had read\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was no time to make it longer. Time was so very precious. My dear\r\nfriend Mr Eugene Wrayburn is dying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dressmaker clasped her hands, and uttered a little piteous cry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is dying,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Lightwood, with emotion, \xe2\x80\x98at some distance from\r\nhere. He is sinking under injuries received at the hands of a villain\r\nwho attacked him in the dark. I come straight from his bedside. He is\r\nalmost always insensible. In a short restless interval of sensibility,\r\nor partial sensibility, I made out that he asked for you to be brought\r\nto sit by him. Hardly relying on my own interpretation of the indistinct\r\nsounds he made, I caused Lizzie to hear them. We were both sure that he\r\nasked for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dressmaker, with her hands still clasped, looked affrightedly from\r\nthe one to the other of her two companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you delay, he may die with his request ungratified, with his\r\nlast wish--intrusted to me--we have long been much more than\r\nbrothers--unfulfilled. I shall break down, if I try to say more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the black bonnet and the crutch-stick were on duty, the\r\ngood Jew was left in possession of the house, and the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker,\r\nside by side in a chaise with Mortimer Lightwood, was posting out of\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nTHE DOLLS\xe2\x80\x99 DRESSMAKER DISCOVERS A WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nA darkened and hushed room; the river outside the windows flowing on\r\nto the vast ocean; a figure on the bed, swathed and bandaged and bound,\r\nlying helpless on its back, with its two useless arms in splints at its\r\nsides. Only two days of usage so familiarized the little dressmaker\r\nwith this scene, that it held the place occupied two days ago by the\r\nrecollections of years.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely moved since her arrival. Sometimes his eyes were open,\r\nsometimes closed. When they were open, there was no meaning in their\r\nunwinking stare at one spot straight before them, unless for a moment\r\nthe brow knitted into a faint expression of anger, or surprise. Then,\r\nMortimer Lightwood would speak to him, and on occasions he would be so\r\nfar roused as to make an attempt to pronounce his friend\xe2\x80\x99s name. But, in\r\nan instant consciousness was gone again, and no spirit of Eugene was in\r\nEugene\xe2\x80\x99s crushed outer form.\r\n\r\nThey provided Jenny with materials for plying her work, and she had a\r\nlittle table placed at the foot of his bed. Sitting there, with her rich\r\nshower of hair falling over the chair-back, they hoped she might attract\r\nhis notice. With the same object, she would sing, just above her breath,\r\nwhen he opened his eyes, or she saw his brow knit into that faint\r\nexpression, so evanescent that it was like a shape made in water. But\r\nas yet he had not heeded. The \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99 here mentioned were the medical\r\nattendant; Lizzie, who was there in all her intervals of rest; and\r\nLightwood, who never left him.\r\n\r\nThe two days became three, and the three days became four. At length,\r\nquite unexpectedly, he said something in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was it, my dear Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you, Mortimer--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will I--?\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x98Send for her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow, she is here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuite unconscious of the long blank, he supposed that they were still\r\nspeaking together.\r\n\r\nThe little dressmaker stood up at the foot of the bed, humming her song,\r\nand nodded to him brightly. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t shake hands, Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene,\r\nwith something of his old look; \xe2\x80\x98but I am very glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer repeated this to her, for it could only be made out by bending\r\nover him and closely watching his attempts to say it. In a little while,\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask her if she has seen the children.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer could not understand this, neither could Jenny herself, until\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask her if she has smelt the flowers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I know!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Jenny. \xe2\x80\x98I understand him now!\xe2\x80\x99 Then, Lightwood\r\nyielded his place to her quick approach, and she said, bending over the\r\nbed, with that better look: \xe2\x80\x98You mean my long bright slanting rows of\r\nchildren, who used to bring me ease and rest? You mean the children who\r\nused to take me up, and make me light?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene smiled, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not seen them since I saw you. I never see them now, but I am\r\nhardly ever in pain now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a pretty fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I have heard my birds sing,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the little creature, \xe2\x80\x98and I have\r\nsmelt my flowers. Yes, indeed I have! And both were most beautiful and\r\nmost Divine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay and help to nurse me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, quietly. \xe2\x80\x98I should like you to\r\nhave the fancy here, before I die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe touched his lips with her hand, and shaded her eyes with that same\r\nhand as she went back to her work and her little low song. He heard the\r\nsong with evident pleasure, until she allowed it gradually to sink away\r\ninto silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mortimer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you can give me anything to keep me here for only a few minutes--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To keep you here, Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To prevent my wandering away I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where--for I begin to be\r\nsensible that I have just come back, and that I shall lose myself\r\nagain--do so, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer gave him such stimulants as could be given him with safety\r\n(they were always at hand, ready), and bending over him once more, was\r\nabout to caution him, when he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me not to speak, for I must speak. If you knew the\r\nharassing anxiety that gnaws and wears me when I am wandering in those\r\nplaces--where are those endless places, Mortimer? They must be at an\r\nimmense distance!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe saw in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s face that he was losing himself; for he added\r\nafter a moment: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid--I am not gone yet. What was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You wanted to tell me something, Eugene. My poor dear fellow, you\r\nwanted to say something to your old friend--to the friend who has always\r\nloved you, admired you, imitated you, founded himself upon you, been\r\nnothing without you, and who, God knows, would be here in your place if\r\nhe could!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tut, tut!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene with a tender glance as the other put his hand\r\nbefore his face. \xe2\x80\x98I am not worth it. I acknowledge that I like it,\r\ndear boy, but I am not worth it. This attack, my dear Mortimer; this\r\nmurder--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend leaned over him with renewed attention, saying: \xe2\x80\x98You and I\r\nsuspect some one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More than suspect. But, Mortimer, while I lie here, and when I lie\r\nhere no longer, I trust to you that the perpetrator is never brought to\r\njustice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her innocent reputation would be ruined, my friend. She would be\r\npunished, not he. I have wronged her enough in fact; I have wronged her\r\nstill more in intention. You recollect what pavement is said to be made\r\nof good intentions. It is made of bad intentions too. Mortimer, I am\r\nlying on it, and I know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be comforted, my dear Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will, when you have promised me. Dear Mortimer, the man must never be\r\npursued. If he should be accused, you must keep him silent and save\r\nhim. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of avenging me; think only of hushing the story\r\nand protecting her. You can confuse the case, and turn aside the\r\ncircumstances. Listen to what I say to you. It was not the schoolmaster,\r\nBradley Headstone. Do you hear me? Twice; it was not the schoolmaster,\r\nBradley Headstone. Do you hear me? Three times; it was not the\r\nschoolmaster, Bradley Headstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped, exhausted. His speech had been whispered, broken, and\r\nindistinct; but by a great effort he had made it plain enough to be\r\nunmistakeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear fellow, I am wandering away. Stay me for another moment, if you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood lifted his head at the neck, and put a wine-glass to his lips.\r\nHe rallied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long ago it was done, whether weeks, days, or hours.\r\nNo matter. There is inquiry on foot, and pursuit. Say! Is there not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Check it; divert it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her be brought in question. Shield\r\nher. The guilty man, brought to justice, would poison her name. Let the\r\nguilty man go unpunished. Lizzie and my reparation before all! Promise\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, I do. I promise you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the act of turning his eyes gratefully towards his friend, he\r\nwandered away. His eyes stood still, and settled into that former intent\r\nunmeaning stare.\r\n\r\nHours and hours, days and nights, he remained in this same condition.\r\nThere were times when he would calmly speak to his friend after a long\r\nperiod of unconsciousness, and would say he was better, and would ask\r\nfor something. Before it could be given him, he would be gone again.\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, all softened compassion now, watched him with an\r\nearnestness that never relaxed. She would regularly change the ice, or\r\nthe cooling spirit, on his head, and would keep her ear at the pillow\r\nbetweenwhiles, listening for any faint words that fell from him in his\r\nwanderings. It was amazing through how many hours at a time she would\r\nremain beside him, in a crouching attitude, attentive to his slightest\r\nmoan. As he could not move a hand, he could make no sign of distress;\r\nbut, through this close watching (if through no secret sympathy or\r\npower) the little creature attained an understanding of him that\r\nLightwood did not possess. Mortimer would often turn to her, as if she\r\nwere an interpreter between this sentient world and the insensible man;\r\nand she would change the dressing of a wound, or ease a ligature, or\r\nturn his face, or alter the pressure of the bedclothes on him, with an\r\nabsolute certainty of doing right. The natural lightness and delicacy of\r\ntouch which had become very refined by practice in her miniature work,\r\nno doubt was involved in this; but her perception was at least as fine.\r\n\r\nThe one word, Lizzie, he muttered millions of times. In a certain phase\r\nof his distressful state, which was the worst to those who tended him,\r\nhe would roll his head upon the pillow, incessantly repeating the name\r\nin a hurried and impatient manner, with the misery of a disturbed mind,\r\nand the monotony of a machine. Equally, when he lay still and staring,\r\nhe would repeat it for hours without cessation, but then, always in a\r\ntone of subdued warning and horror. Her presence and her touch upon his\r\nbreast or face would often stop this, and then they learned to expect\r\nthat he would for some time remain still, with his eyes closed, and that\r\nhe would be conscious on opening them. But, the heavy disappointment of\r\ntheir hope--revived by the welcome silence of the room--was, that his\r\nspirit would glide away again and be lost, in the moment of their joy\r\nthat it was there.\r\n\r\nThis frequent rising of a drowning man from the deep, to sink again, was\r\ndreadful to the beholders. But, gradually the change stole upon him that\r\nit became dreadful to himself. His desire to impart something that was\r\non his mind, his unspeakable yearning to have speech with his friend\r\nand make a communication to him, so troubled him when he recovered\r\nconsciousness, that its term was thereby shortened. As the man rising\r\nfrom the deep would disappear the sooner for fighting with the water, so\r\nhe in his desperate struggle went down again.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon when he had been lying still, and Lizzie, unrecognized,\r\nhad just stolen out of the room to pursue her occupation, he uttered\r\nLightwood\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Eugene, I am here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long is this to last, Mortimer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood shook his head. \xe2\x80\x98Still, Eugene, you are no worse than you\r\nwere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I know there\xe2\x80\x99s no hope. Yet I pray it may last long enough for you\r\nto do me one last service, and for me to do one last action. Keep me\r\nhere a few moments, Mortimer. Try, try!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend gave him what aid he could, and encouraged him to believe\r\nthat he was more composed, though even then his eyes were losing the\r\nexpression they so rarely recovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hold me here, dear fellow, if you can. Stop my wandering away. I am\r\ngoing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not yet, not yet. Tell me, dear Eugene, what is it I shall do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep me here for only a single minute. I am going away again. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nme go. Hear me speak first. Stop me--stop me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My poor Eugene, try to be calm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do try. I try so hard. If you only knew how hard! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me wander\r\ntill I have spoken. Give me a little more wine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood complied. Eugene, with a most pathetic struggle against the\r\nunconsciousness that was coming over him, and with a look of appeal that\r\naffected his friend profoundly, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can leave me with Jenny, while you speak to her and tell her what I\r\nbeseech of her. You can leave me with Jenny, while you are gone. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot much for you to do. You won\xe2\x80\x99t be long away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, no. But tell me what it is that I shall do, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going! You can\xe2\x80\x99t hold me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me in a word, Eugene!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fixed again, and the only word that came from his lips was\r\nthe word millions of times repeated. Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie.\r\n\r\nBut, the watchful little dressmaker had been vigilant as ever in her\r\nwatch, and she now came up and touched Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s arm as he looked down\r\nat his friend, despairingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with her finger on her lips. \xe2\x80\x98His eyes are closing.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be conscious when he next opens them. Shall I give you a leading\r\nword to say to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Jenny, if you could only give me the right word!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can. Stoop down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stooped, and she whispered in his ear. She whispered in his ear one\r\nshort word of a single syllable. Lightwood started, and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little creature, with an excited and exultant face.\r\nShe then bent over the unconscious man, and, for the first time, kissed\r\nhim on the cheek, and kissed the poor maimed hand that was nearest to\r\nher. Then, she withdrew to the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nSome two hours afterwards, Mortimer Lightwood saw his consciousness come\r\nback, and instantly, but very tranquilly, bent over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak, Eugene. Do no more than look at me, and listen to me. You\r\nfollow what I say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe moved his head in assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going on from the point where we broke off. Is the word we should\r\nsoon have come to--is it--Wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O God bless you, Mortimer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be agitated. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak. Hear me, dear Eugene. Your mind\r\nwill be more at peace, lying here, if you make Lizzie your wife. You\r\nwish me to speak to her, and tell her so, and entreat her to be your\r\nwife. You ask her to kneel at this bedside and be married to you, that\r\nyour reparation may be complete. Is that so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. God bless you! Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It shall be done, Eugene. Trust it to me. I shall have to go away\r\nfor some few hours, to give effect to your wishes. You see this is\r\nunavoidable?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear friend, I said so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True. But I had not the clue then. How do you think I got it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGlancing wistfully around, Eugene saw Miss Jenny at the foot of the bed,\r\nlooking at him with her elbows on the bed, and her head upon her hands.\r\nThere was a trace of his whimsical air upon him, as he tried to smile at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98the discovery was hers. Observe my dear\r\nEugene; while I am away you will know that I have discharged my trust\r\nwith Lizzie, by finding her here, in my present place at your bedside,\r\nto leave you no more. A final word before I go. This is the right course\r\nof a true man, Eugene. And I solemnly believe, with all my soul, that if\r\nProvidence should mercifully restore you to us, you will be blessed with\r\na noble wife in the preserver of your life, whom you will dearly love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amen. I am sure of that. But I shall not come through it, Mortimer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not be the less hopeful or less strong, for this, Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. Touch my face with yours, in case I should not hold out till you\r\ncome back. I love you, Mortimer. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy for me while you are\r\ngone. If my dear brave girl will take me, I feel persuaded that I shall\r\nlive long enough to be married, dear fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Jenny gave up altogether on this parting taking place between the\r\nfriends, and sitting with her back towards the bed in the bower made by\r\nher bright hair, wept heartily, though noiselessly. Mortimer Lightwood\r\nwas soon gone. As the evening light lengthened the heavy reflections of\r\nthe trees in the river, another figure came with a soft step into the\r\nsick room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he conscious?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the little dressmaker, as the figure took its\r\nstation by the pillow. For, Jenny had given place to it immediately, and\r\ncould not see the sufferer\xe2\x80\x99s face, in the dark room, from her new and\r\nremoved position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is conscious, Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Eugene for himself. \xe2\x80\x98He knows his\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nEFFECT IS GIVEN TO THE DOLLS\xe2\x80\x99 DRESSMAKER\xe2\x80\x99S DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs John Rokesmith sat at needlework in her neat little room, beside a\r\nbasket of neat little articles of clothing, which presented so much of\r\nthe appearance of being in the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker\xe2\x80\x99s way of business, that\r\none might have supposed she was going to set up in opposition to Miss\r\nWren. Whether the Complete British Family Housewife had imparted sage\r\ncounsel anent them, did not appear, but probably not, as that cloudy\r\noracle was nowhere visible. For certain, however, Mrs John Rokesmith\r\nstitched at them with so dexterous a hand, that she must have taken\r\nlessons of somebody. Love is in all things a most wonderful teacher,\r\nand perhaps love (from a pictorial point of view, with nothing on but\r\na thimble), had been teaching this branch of needlework to Mrs John\r\nRokesmith.\r\n\r\nIt was near John\xe2\x80\x99s time for coming home, but as Mrs John was desirous to\r\nfinish a special triumph of her skill before dinner, she did not go out\r\nto meet him. Placidly, though rather consequentially smiling, she sat\r\nstitching away with a regular sound, like a sort of dimpled little\r\ncharming Dresden-china clock by the very best maker.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door, and a ring at the bell. Not John; or Bella would\r\nhave flown out to meet him. Then who, if not John? Bella was asking\r\nherself the question, when that fluttering little fool of a servant\r\nfluttered in, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh good gracious!\r\n\r\nBella had but time to throw a handkerchief over the basket, when Mr\r\nLightwood made his bow. There was something amiss with Mr Lightwood, for\r\nhe was strangely grave and looked ill.\r\n\r\nWith a brief reference to the happy time when it had been his privilege\r\nto know Mrs Rokesmith as Miss Wilfer, Mr Lightwood explained what was\r\namiss with him and why he came. He came bearing Lizzie Hexam\xe2\x80\x99s earnest\r\nhope that Mrs John Rokesmith would see her married.\r\n\r\nBella was so fluttered by the request, and by the short narrative he had\r\nfeelingly given her, that there never was a more timely smelling-bottle\r\nthan John\xe2\x80\x99s knock. \xe2\x80\x98My husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, that turned out to be more easily said than done; for, the instant\r\nshe mentioned Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s name, John stopped, with his hand upon the\r\nlock of the room door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come up stairs, my darling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella was amazed by the flush in his face, and by his sudden turning\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x98What can it mean?\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, as she accompanied him up stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, my life,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, taking her on his knee, \xe2\x80\x98tell me all about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll very well to say, \xe2\x80\x98Tell me all about it;\xe2\x80\x99 but John was very much\r\nconfused. His attention evidently trailed off, now and then, even while\r\nBella told him all about it. Yet she knew that he took a great interest\r\nin Lizzie and her fortunes. What could it mean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will come to this marriage with me, John dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N--no, my love; I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite out of the question. Not to be thought of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I to go alone, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear, you will go with Mr Lightwood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s time we went down to Mr Lightwood, John dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBella insinuated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost time you went, but I must ask you to excuse me\r\nto him altogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You never mean, John dear, that you are not going to see him? Why, he\r\nknows you have come home. I told him so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a little unfortunate, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped. Unfortunate or\r\nfortunate, I positively cannot see him, my love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella cast about in her mind what could be his reason for this\r\nunaccountable behaviour; as she sat on his knee looking at him in\r\nastonishment and pouting a little. A weak reason presented itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John dear, you never can be jealous of Mr Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, my precious child,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her husband, laughing outright: \xe2\x80\x98how\r\ncould I be jealous of him? Why should I be jealous of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, you know, John,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Bella, pouting a little more, \xe2\x80\x98though\r\nhe did rather admire me once, it was not my fault.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was your fault that I admired you,\xe2\x80\x99 returned her husband, with a\r\nlook of pride in her, \xe2\x80\x98and why not your fault that he admired you? But,\r\nI jealous on that account? Why, I must go distracted for life, if I\r\nturned jealous of every one who used to find my wife beautiful and\r\nwinning!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am half angry with you, John dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, laughing a little,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and half pleased with you; because you are such a stupid old fellow,\r\nand yet you say nice things, as if you meant them. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be mysterious,\r\nsir. What harm do you know of Mr Lightwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None, my love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has he ever done to you, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has never done anything to me, my dear. I know no more against\r\nhim than I know against Mr Wrayburn; he has never done anything to me;\r\nneither has Mr Wrayburn. And yet I have exactly the same objection to\r\nboth of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, John!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bella, as if she were giving him up for a bad job,\r\nas she used to give up herself. \xe2\x80\x98You are nothing better than a sphinx!\r\nAnd a married sphinx isn\xe2\x80\x99t a--isn\xe2\x80\x99t a nice confidential husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nBella, in a tone of injury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bella, my life,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Rokesmith, touching her cheek, with a grave\r\nsmile, as she cast down her eyes and pouted again; \xe2\x80\x98look at me. I want\r\nto speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In earnest, Blue Beard of the secret chamber?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella, clearing\r\nher pretty face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In earnest. And I confess to the secret chamber. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember\r\nthat you asked me not to declare what I thought of your higher qualities\r\nuntil you had been tried?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, John dear. And I fully meant it, and I fully mean it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The time will come, my darling--I am no prophet, but I say so,--when\r\nyou WILL be tried. The time will come, I think, when you will undergo\r\na trial through which you will never pass quite triumphantly for me,\r\nunless you can put perfect faith in me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you may be sure of me, John dear, for I can put perfect faith in\r\nyou, and I do, and I always, always will. Don\xe2\x80\x99t judge me by a little\r\nthing like this, John. In little things, I am a little thing myself--I\r\nalways was. But in great things, I hope not; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to boast, John\r\ndear, but I hope not!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was even better convinced of the truth of what she said than she was,\r\nas he felt her loving arms about him. If the Golden Dustman\xe2\x80\x99s riches had\r\nbeen his to stake, he would have staked them to the last farthing on the\r\nfidelity through good and evil of her affectionate and trusting heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down to, and go away with, Mr Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella,\r\nspringing up. \xe2\x80\x98You are the most creasing and tumbling Clumsy-Boots of a\r\npacker, John, that ever was; but if you\xe2\x80\x99re quite good, and will promise\r\nnever to do so any more (though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you have done!) you\r\nmay pack me a little bag for a night, while I get my bonnet on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gaily complied, and she tied her dimpled chin up, and shook her head\r\ninto her bonnet, and pulled out the bows of her bonnet-strings, and\r\ngot her gloves on, finger by finger, and finally got them on her\r\nlittle plump hands, and bade him good-bye and went down. Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpatience was much relieved when he found her dressed for departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Rokesmith goes with us?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, hesitating, with a look towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I forgot!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bella. \xe2\x80\x98His best compliments. His face is\r\nswollen to the size of two faces, and he is to go to bed directly, poor\r\nfellow, to wait for the doctor, who is coming to lance him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is curious,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98that I have never yet seen Mr\r\nRokesmith, though we have been engaged in the same affairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really?\xe2\x80\x99 said the unblushing Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I begin to think,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98that I never shall see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These things happen so oddly sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella with a steady\r\ncountenance, \xe2\x80\x98that there seems a kind of fatality in them. But I am\r\nquite ready, Mr Lightwood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey started directly, in a little carriage that Lightwood had brought\r\nwith him from never-to-be-forgotten Greenwich; and from Greenwich they\r\nstarted directly for London; and in London they waited at a railway\r\nstation until such time as the Reverend Frank Milvey, and Margaretta\r\nhis wife, with whom Mortimer Lightwood had been already in conference,\r\nshould come and join them.\r\n\r\nThat worthy couple were delayed by a portentous old parishioner of the\r\nfemale gender, who was one of the plagues of their lives, and with whom\r\nthey bore with most exemplary sweetness and good-humour, notwithstanding\r\nher having an infection of absurdity about her, that communicated itself\r\nto everything with which, and everybody with whom, she came in contact.\r\nShe was a member of the Reverend Frank\xe2\x80\x99s congregation, and made a point\r\nof distinguishing herself in that body, by conspicuously weeping at\r\neverything, however cheering, said by the Reverend Frank in his public\r\nministration; also by applying to herself the various lamentations of\r\nDavid, and complaining in a personally injured manner (much in arrear of\r\nthe clerk and the rest of the respondents) that her enemies were digging\r\npit-falls about her, and breaking her with rods of iron. Indeed, this\r\nold widow discharged herself of that portion of the Morning and Evening\r\nService as if she were lodging a complaint on oath and applying for\r\na warrant before a magistrate. But this was not her most inconvenient\r\ncharacteristic, for that took the form of an impression, usually\r\nrecurring in inclement weather and at about daybreak, that she had\r\nsomething on her mind and stood in immediate need of the Reverend Frank\r\nto come and take it off. Many a time had that kind creature got up, and\r\ngone out to Mrs Sprodgkin (such was the disciple\xe2\x80\x99s name), suppressing\r\na strong sense of her comicality by his strong sense of duty, and\r\nperfectly knowing that nothing but a cold would come of it. However,\r\nbeyond themselves, the Reverend Frank Milvey and Mrs Milvey seldom\r\nhinted that Mrs Sprodgkin was hardly worth the trouble she gave; but\r\nboth made the best of her, as they did of all their troubles.\r\n\r\nThis very exacting member of the fold appeared to be endowed with a\r\nsixth sense, in regard of knowing when the Reverend Frank Milvey least\r\ndesired her company, and with promptitude appearing in his little hall.\r\nConsequently, when the Reverend Frank had willingly engaged that he and\r\nhis wife would accompany Lightwood back, he said, as a matter of course:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must make haste to get out, Margaretta, my dear, or we shall be\r\ndescended on by Mrs Sprodgkin.\xe2\x80\x99 To which Mrs Milvey replied, in her\r\npleasantly emphatic way, \xe2\x80\x98Oh YES, for she IS such a marplot, Frank, and\r\nDOES worry so!\xe2\x80\x99 Words that were scarcely uttered when their theme\r\nwas announced as in faithful attendance below, desiring counsel on a\r\nspiritual matter. The points on which Mrs Sprodgkin sought elucidation\r\nbeing seldom of a pressing nature (as Who begat Whom, or some\r\ninformation concerning the Amorites), Mrs Milvey on this special\r\noccasion resorted to the device of buying her off with a present of tea\r\nand sugar, and a loaf and butter. These gifts Mrs Sprodgkin accepted,\r\nbut still insisted on dutifully remaining in the hall, to curtsey to the\r\nReverend Frank as he came forth. Who, incautiously saying in his genial\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98Well, Sally, there you are!\xe2\x80\x99 involved himself in a discursive\r\naddress from Mrs Sprodgkin, revolving around the result that she\r\nregarded tea and sugar in the light of myrrh and frankincense, and\r\nconsidered bread and butter identical with locusts and wild honey.\r\nHaving communicated this edifying piece of information, Mrs Sprodgkin\r\nwas left still unadjourned in the hall, and Mr and Mrs Milvey hurried in\r\na heated condition to the railway station. All of which is here recorded\r\nto the honour of that good Christian pair, representatives of hundreds\r\nof other good Christian pairs as conscientious and as useful, who merge\r\nthe smallness of their work in its greatness, and feel in no danger of\r\nlosing dignity when they adapt themselves to incomprehensible humbugs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Detained at the last moment by one who had a claim upon me,\xe2\x80\x99 was the\r\nReverend Frank\xe2\x80\x99s apology to Lightwood, taking no thought of himself.\r\nTo which Mrs Milvey added, taking thought for him, like the championing\r\nlittle wife she was; \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, detained at the last moment. But AS to\r\nthe claim, Frank, I MUST say that I DO think you are OVER-considerate\r\nsometimes, and allow THAT to be a LITTLE abused.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella felt conscious, in spite of her late pledge for herself, that her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s absence would give disagreeable occasion for surprise to the\r\nMilveys. Nor could she appear quite at her ease when Mrs Milvey asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98HOW is Mr Rokesmith, and IS he gone before us, or DOES he follow us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt becoming necessary, upon this, to send him to bed again and hold him\r\nin waiting to be lanced again, Bella did it. But not half as well on\r\nthe second occasion as on the first; for, a twice-told white one seems\r\nalmost to become a black one, when you are not used to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh DEAR!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey, \xe2\x80\x98I am SO sorry! Mr Rokesmith took SUCH an\r\ninterest in Lizzie Hexam, when we were there before. And if we had ONLY\r\nknown of his face, we COULD have given him something that would have\r\nkept it down long enough for so SHORT a purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy way of making the white one whiter, Bella hastened to stipulate that\r\nhe was not in pain. Mrs Milvey was SO glad of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know HOW it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Milvey, \xe2\x80\x98and I am SURE you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nFrank, but the clergy and their wives seem to CAUSE swelled faces.\r\nWhenever I take notice of a child in the school, it seems to me as if\r\nits face swelled INSTANTLY. Frank NEVER makes acquaintance with a new\r\nold woman, but she gets the face-ache. And another thing is, we DO make\r\nthe poor children sniff so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know HOW we do it, and I should\r\nbe so glad not to; but the MORE we take notice of them, the MORE they\r\nsniff. Just as they do when the text is given out.--Frank, that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nschoolmaster. I have seen him somewhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe reference was to a young man of reserved appearance, in a coat and\r\nwaistcoat of black, and pantaloons of pepper and salt. He had come\r\ninto the office of the station, from its interior, in an unsettled way,\r\nimmediately after Lightwood had gone out to the train; and he had been\r\nhurriedly reading the printed bills and notices on the wall. He had had\r\na wandering interest in what was said among the people waiting there\r\nand passing to and fro. He had drawn nearer, at about the time when\r\nMrs Milvey mentioned Lizzie Hexam, and had remained near, since: though\r\nalways glancing towards the door by which Lightwood had gone out. He\r\nstood with his back towards them, and his gloved hands clasped behind\r\nhim. There was now so evident a faltering upon him, expressive of\r\nindecision whether or no he should express his having heard himself\r\nreferred to, that Mr Milvey spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot recall your name,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98but I remember to have seen you\r\nin your school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My name is Bradley Headstone, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, backing into a more\r\nretired place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ought to have remembered it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey, giving him his hand. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhope you are well? A little overworked, I am afraid?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am overworked just at present, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had no play in your last holiday time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All work and no play, Mr Headstone, will not make dulness, in your\r\ncase, I dare say; but it will make dyspepsia, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will endeavour to take care, sir. Might I beg leave to speak to you,\r\noutside, a moment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and the office was well lighted. The schoolmaster, who\r\nhad never remitted his watch on Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s door, now moved by another\r\ndoor to a corner without, where there was more shadow than light; and\r\nsaid, plucking at his gloves:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of your ladies, sir, mentioned within my hearing a name that I am\r\nacquainted with; I may say, well acquainted with. The name of the sister\r\nof an old pupil of mine. He was my pupil for a long time, and has got on\r\nand gone upward rapidly. The name of Hexam. The name of Lizzie Hexam.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe seemed to be a shy man, struggling against nervousness, and spoke in\r\na very constrained way. The break he set between his last two sentences\r\nwas quite embarrassing to his hearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Milvey. \xe2\x80\x98We are going down to see her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I gathered as much, sir. I hope there is nothing amiss with the sister\r\nof my old pupil? I hope no bereavement has befallen her. I hope she is\r\nin no affliction? Has lost no--relation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Milvey thought this a man with a very odd manner, and a dark downward\r\nlook; but he answered in his usual open way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad to tell you, Mr Headstone, that the sister of your old pupil\r\nhas not sustained any such loss. You thought I might be going down to\r\nbury some one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may have been the connexion of ideas, sir, with your clerical\r\ncharacter, but I was not conscious of it.--Then you are not, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA man with a very odd manner indeed, and with a lurking look that was\r\nquite oppressive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. In fact,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey, \xe2\x80\x98since you are so interested in the\r\nsister of your old pupil, I may as well tell you that I am going down to\r\nmarry her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe schoolmaster started back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to marry her, myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98because I\r\nhave a wife already. To perform the marriage service at her wedding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley Headstone caught hold of a pillar behind him. If Mr Milvey knew\r\nan ashy face when he saw it, he saw it then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite ill, Mr Headstone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not much, sir. It will pass over very soon. I am accustomed to be\r\nseized with giddiness. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me detain you, sir; I stand in need\r\nof no assistance, I thank you. Much obliged by your sparing me these\r\nminutes of your time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs Mr Milvey, who had no more minutes to spare, made a suitable reply\r\nand turned back into the office, he observed the schoolmaster to\r\nlean against the pillar with his hat in his hand, and to pull at his\r\nneckcloth as if he were trying to tear it off. The Reverend Frank\r\naccordingly directed the notice of one of the attendants to him, by\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x98There is a person outside who seems to be really ill, and to\r\nrequire some help, though he says he does not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood had by this time secured their places, and the departure-bell\r\nwas about to be rung. They took their seats, and were beginning to\r\nmove out of the station, when the same attendant came running along the\r\nplatform, looking into all the carriages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! You are here, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, springing on the step, and holding\r\nthe window-frame by his elbow, as the carriage moved. \xe2\x80\x98That person you\r\npointed out to me is in a fit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I infer from what he told me that he is subject to such attacks. He\r\nwill come to, in the air, in a little while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was took very bad to be sure, and was biting and knocking about him\r\n(the man said) furiously. Would the gentleman give him his card, as he\r\nhad seen him first? The gentleman did so, with the explanation that\r\nhe knew no more of the man attacked than that he was a man of a very\r\nrespectable occupation, who had said he was out of health, as his\r\nappearance would of itself have indicated. The attendant received the\r\ncard, watched his opportunity for sliding down, slid down, and so it\r\nended.\r\n\r\nThen, the train rattled among the house-tops, and among the ragged sides\r\nof houses torn down to make way for it, and over the swarming streets,\r\nand under the fruitful earth, until it shot across the river: bursting\r\nover the quiet surface like a bomb-shell, and gone again as if it had\r\nexploded in the rush of smoke and steam and glare. A little more, and\r\nagain it roared across the river, a great rocket: spurning the watery\r\nturnings and doublings with ineffable contempt, and going straight to\r\nits end, as Father Time goes to his. To whom it is no matter what living\r\nwaters run high or low, reflect the heavenly lights and darknesses,\r\nproduce their little growth of weeds and flowers, turn here, turn there,\r\nare noisy or still, are troubled or at rest, for their course has one\r\nsure termination, though their sources and devices are many.\r\n\r\nThen, a carriage ride succeeded, near the solemn river, stealing away\r\nby night, as all things steal away, by night and by day, so quietly\r\nyielding to the attraction of the loadstone rock of Eternity; and the\r\nnearer they drew to the chamber where Eugene lay, the more they feared\r\nthat they might find his wanderings done. At last they saw its dim light\r\nshining out, and it gave them hope: though Lightwood faltered as he\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x98If he were gone, she would still be sitting by him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he lay quiet, half in stupor, half in sleep. Bella, entering with\r\na raised admonitory finger, kissed Lizzie softly, but said not a word.\r\nNeither did any of them speak, but all sat down at the foot of the bed,\r\nsilently waiting. And now, in this night-watch, mingling with the flow\r\nof the river and with the rush of the train, came the questions into\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s mind again: What could be in the depths of that mystery of\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s? Why was it that he had never been seen by Mr Lightwood, whom he\r\nstill avoided? When would that trial come, through which her faith\r\nin, and her duty to, her dear husband, was to carry her, rendering him\r\ntriumphant? For, that had been his term. Her passing through the trial\r\nwas to make the man she loved with all her heart, triumphant. Term not\r\nto sink out of sight in Bella\xe2\x80\x99s breast.\r\n\r\nFar on in the night, Eugene opened his eyes. He was sensible, and said\r\nat once: \xe2\x80\x98How does the time go? Has our Mortimer come back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood was there immediately, to answer for himself. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Eugene,\r\nand all is ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear boy!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98we both thank you heartily.\r\nLizzie, tell them how welcome they are, and that I would be eloquent if\r\nI could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no need,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Milvey. \xe2\x80\x98We know it. Are you better, Mr\r\nWrayburn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am much happier,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much better too, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEugene turned his eyes towards Lizzie, as if to spare her, and answered\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThen, they all stood around the bed, and Mr Milvey, opening his book,\r\nbegan the service; so rarely associated with the shadow of death; so\r\ninseparable in the mind from a flush of life and gaiety and hope and\r\nhealth and joy. Bella thought how different from her own sunny little\r\nwedding, and wept. Mrs Milvey overflowed with pity, and wept too. The\r\ndolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, with her hands before her face, wept in her golden\r\nbower. Reading in a low clear voice, and bending over Eugene, who kept\r\nhis eyes upon him, Mr Milvey did his office with suitable simplicity.\r\nAs the bridegroom could not move his hand, they touched his fingers with\r\nthe ring, and so put it on the bride. When the two plighted their troth,\r\nshe laid her hand on his and kept it there. When the ceremony was done,\r\nand all the rest departed from the room, she drew her arm under his\r\nhead, and laid her own head down upon the pillow by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Undraw the curtains, my dear girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, after a while, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nlet us see our wedding-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sun was rising, and his first rays struck into the room, as she came\r\nback, and put her lips to his. \xe2\x80\x98I bless the day!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98I bless\r\nthe day!\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have made a poor marriage of it, my sweet wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nshattered graceless fellow, stretched at his length here, and next to\r\nnothing for you when you are a young widow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have made the marriage that I would have given all the world to dare\r\nto hope for,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have thrown yourself away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x98But you\r\nhave followed the treasure of your heart. My justification is, that you\r\nhad thrown that away first, dear girl!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I had given it to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The same thing, my poor Lizzie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! hush! A very different thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere were tears in his eyes, and she besought him to close them. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Eugene, again shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x98let me look at you, Lizzie, while\r\nI can. You brave devoted girl! You heroine!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer own eyes filled under his praises. And when he mustered strength to\r\nmove his wounded head a very little way, and lay it on her bosom, the\r\ntears of both fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, after a silence: \xe2\x80\x98when you see me wandering away\r\nfrom this refuge that I have so ill deserved, speak to me by my name,\r\nand I think I shall come back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, dear Eugene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98I should have gone then, but for that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little while afterwards, when he appeared to be sinking into\r\ninsensibility, she said, in a calm loving voice: \xe2\x80\x98Eugene, my dear\r\nhusband!\xe2\x80\x99 He immediately answered: \xe2\x80\x98There again! You see how you can\r\nrecall me!\xe2\x80\x99 And afterwards, when he could not speak, he still answered\r\nby a slight movement of his head upon her bosom.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high in the sky, when she gently disengaged herself to give\r\nhim the stimulants and nourishment he required. The utter helplessness\r\nof the wreck of him that lay cast ashore there, now alarmed her, but he\r\nhimself appeared a little more hopeful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, my beloved Lizzie!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, faintly. \xe2\x80\x98How shall I ever pay all I\r\nowe you, if I recover!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be ashamed of me,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, \xe2\x80\x98and you will have more than paid\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would require a life, Lizzie, to pay all; more than a life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Live for that, then; live for me, Eugene; live to see how hard I will\r\ntry to improve myself, and never to discredit you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling girl,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, rallying more of his old manner than\r\nhe had ever yet got together. \xe2\x80\x98On the contrary, I have been thinking\r\nwhether it is not the best thing I can do, to die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best thing you can do, to leave me with a broken heart?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that, my dear girl. I was not thinking of that. What I was\r\nthinking of was this. Out of your compassion for me, in this maimed and\r\nbroken state, you make so much of me--you think so well of me--you love\r\nme so dearly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven knows I love you dearly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Heaven knows I prize it! Well. If I live, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find me out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall find out that my husband has a mine of purpose and energy, and\r\nwill turn it to the best account?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so, dearest Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, wistfully, and yet somewhat\r\nwhimsically. \xe2\x80\x98I hope so. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t summon the vanity to think so. How\r\ncan I think so, looking back on such a trifling wasted youth as mine! I\r\nhumbly hope it; but I daren\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. There is a sharp misgiving\r\nin my conscience that if I were to live, I should disappoint your good\r\nopinion and my own--and that I ought to die, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING SHADOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winds and tides rose and fell a certain number of times, the earth\r\nmoved round the sun a certain number of times, the ship upon the ocean\r\nmade her voyage safely, and brought a baby-Bella home. Then who so blest\r\nand happy as Mrs John Rokesmith, saving and excepting Mr John Rokesmith!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you not like to be rich NOW, my darling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you ask me such a question, John dear? Am I not rich?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese were among the first words spoken near the baby Bella as she lay\r\nasleep. She soon proved to be a baby of wonderful intelligence,\r\nevincing the strongest objection to her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s society, and\r\nbeing invariably seized with a painful acidity of the stomach when that\r\ndignified lady honoured her with any attention.\r\n\r\nIt was charming to see Bella contemplating this baby, and finding out\r\nher own dimples in that tiny reflection, as if she were looking in the\r\nglass without personal vanity. Her cherubic father justly remarked\r\nto her husband that the baby seemed to make her younger than before,\r\nreminding him of the days when she had a pet doll and used to talk to it\r\nas she carried it about. The world might have been challenged to produce\r\nanother baby who had such a store of pleasant nonsense said and sung\r\nto it, as Bella said and sung to this baby; or who was dressed and\r\nundressed as often in four-and-twenty hours as Bella dressed and\r\nundressed this baby; or who was held behind doors and poked out to stop\r\nits father\xe2\x80\x99s way when he came home, as this baby was; or, in a word, who\r\ndid half the number of baby things, through the lively invention of a\r\ngay and proud young mother, that this inexhaustible baby did.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible baby was two or three months old, when Bella began to\r\nnotice a cloud upon her husband\xe2\x80\x99s brow. Watching it, she saw a gathering\r\nand deepening anxiety there, which caused her great disquiet. More than\r\nonce, she awoke him muttering in his sleep; and, though he muttered\r\nnothing worse than her own name, it was plain to her that his\r\nrestlessness originated in some load of care. Therefore, Bella at length\r\nput in her claim to divide this load, and hear her half of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know, John dear,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, cheerily reverting to their former\r\nconversation, \xe2\x80\x98that I hope I may safely be trusted in great things. And\r\nit surely cannot be a little thing that causes you so much uneasiness.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very considerate of you to try to hide from me that you are\r\nuncomfortable about something, but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible to be done,\r\nJohn love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I admit that I am rather uneasy, my own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then please to tell me what about, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut no, he evaded that. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bella, resolutely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John requires me to put perfect faith in him, and he shall not be\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went up to London one day, to meet him, in order that they might\r\nmake some purchases. She found him waiting for her at her journey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend, and they walked away together through the streets. He was in gay\r\nspirits, though still harping on that notion of their being rich; and\r\nhe said, now let them make believe that yonder fine carriage was theirs,\r\nand that it was waiting to take them home to a fine house they had; what\r\nwould Bella, in that case, best like to find in the house? Well! Bella\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know: already having everything she wanted, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\r\nBut, by degrees she was led on to confess that she would like to have\r\nfor the inexhaustible baby such a nursery as never was seen. It was\r\nto be \xe2\x80\x98a very rainbow for colours\xe2\x80\x99, as she was quite sure baby noticed\r\ncolours; and the staircase was to be adorned with the most exquisite\r\nflowers, as she was absolutely certain baby noticed flowers; and there\r\nwas to be an aviary somewhere, of the loveliest little birds, as there\r\nwas not the smallest doubt in the world that baby noticed birds.\r\nWas there nothing else? No, John dear. The predilections of the\r\ninexhaustible baby being provided for, Bella could think of nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThey were chatting on in this way, and John had suggested, \xe2\x80\x98No jewels\r\nfor your own wear, for instance?\xe2\x80\x99 and Bella had replied laughing. O! if\r\nhe came to that, yes, there might be a beautiful ivory case of jewels\r\non her dressing-table; when these pictures were in a moment darkened and\r\nblotted out.\r\n\r\nThey turned a corner, and met Mr Lightwood.\r\n\r\nHe stopped as if he were petrified by the sight of Bella\xe2\x80\x99s husband, who\r\nin the same moment had changed colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood and I have met before,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Met before, John?\xe2\x80\x99 Bella repeated in a tone of wonder. \xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood\r\ntold me he had never seen you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not then know that I had,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, discomposed on her\r\naccount. \xe2\x80\x98I believed that I had only heard of--Mr Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99 With an\r\nemphasis on the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Mr Lightwood saw me, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 observed her husband, not avoiding\r\nhis eye, but looking at him, \xe2\x80\x98my name was Julius Handford.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJulius Handford! The name that Bella had so often seen in old\r\nnewspapers, when she was an inmate of Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house! Julius\r\nHandford, who had been publicly entreated to appear, and for\r\nintelligence of whom a reward had been publicly offered!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would have avoided mentioning it in your presence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood to\r\nBella, delicately; \xe2\x80\x98but since your husband mentions it himself, I must\r\nconfirm his strange admission. I saw him as Mr Julius Handford, and I\r\nafterwards (unquestionably to his knowledge) took great pains to trace\r\nhim out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite true. But it was not my object or my interest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rokesmith,\r\nquietly, \xe2\x80\x98to be traced out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella looked from the one to the other, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued her husband, \xe2\x80\x98as chance has brought us face to\r\nface at last--which is not to be wondered at, for the wonder is, that,\r\nin spite of all my pains to the contrary, chance has not confronted\r\nus together sooner--I have only to remind you that you have been at my\r\nhouse, and to add that I have not changed my residence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir\xe2\x80\x99 returned Lightwood, with a meaning glance towards Bella, \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nposition is a truly painful one. I hope that no complicity in a very\r\ndark transaction may attach to you, but you cannot fail to know that\r\nyour own extraordinary conduct has laid you under suspicion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it has,\xe2\x80\x99 was all the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My professional duty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood hesitating, with another glance\r\ntowards Bella, \xe2\x80\x98is greatly at variance with my personal inclination; but\r\nI doubt, Mr Handford, or Mr Rokesmith, whether I am justified in taking\r\nleave of you here, with your whole course unexplained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella caught her husband by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, my darling. Mr Lightwood will find that he is quite\r\njustified in taking leave of me here. At all events,\xe2\x80\x99 added Rokesmith,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he will find that I mean to take leave of him here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood, \xe2\x80\x98you can scarcely deny that when I came\r\nto your house on the occasion to which you have referred, you avoided me\r\nof a set purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Lightwood, I assure you I have no disposition to deny it, or\r\nintention to deny it. I should have continued to avoid you, in pursuance\r\nof the same set purpose, for a short time longer, if we had not met now.\r\nI am going straight home, and shall remain at home to-morrow until noon.\r\nHereafter, I hope we may be better acquainted. Good-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLightwood stood irresolute, but Bella\xe2\x80\x99s husband passed him in the\r\nsteadiest manner, with Bella on his arm; and they went home without\r\nencountering any further remonstrance or molestation from any one.\r\n\r\nWhen they had dined and were alone, John Rokesmith said to his wife, who\r\nhad preserved her cheerfulness: \xe2\x80\x98And you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, my dear, why I\r\nbore that name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, John love. I should dearly like to know, of course;\xe2\x80\x99 (which her\r\nanxious face confirmed;) \xe2\x80\x98but I wait until you can tell me of your own\r\nfree will. You asked me if I could have perfect faith in you, and I said\r\nyes, and I meant it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt did not escape Bella\xe2\x80\x99s notice that he began to look triumphant. She\r\nwanted no strengthening in her firmness; but if she had had need of any,\r\nshe would have derived it from his kindling face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot have been prepared, my dearest, for such a discovery as that\r\nthis mysterious Mr Handford was identical with your husband?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, John dear, of course not. But you told me to prepare to be tried,\r\nand I prepared myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe drew her to nestle closer to him, and told her it would soon be over,\r\nand the truth would soon appear. \xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98lay stress,\r\nmy dear, on these words that I am going to add. I stand in no kind of\r\nperil, and I can by possibility be hurt at no one\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are quite, quite sure of that, John dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a hair of my head! Moreover, I have done no wrong, and have injured\r\nno man. Shall I swear it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, John!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, laying her hand upon his lips, with a proud\r\nlook. \xe2\x80\x98Never to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But circumstances,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on \xe2\x80\x98--I can, and I will, disperse them in\r\na moment--have surrounded me with one of the strangest suspicions ever\r\nknown. You heard Mr Lightwood speak of a dark transaction?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, John.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are prepared to hear explicitly what he meant?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, John.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My life, he meant the murder of John Harmon, your allotted husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a fast palpitating heart, Bella grasped him by the arm. \xe2\x80\x98You cannot\r\nbe suspected, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear love, I can be--for I am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was silence between them, as she sat looking in his face, with the\r\ncolour quite gone from her own face and lips. \xe2\x80\x98How dare they!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried\r\nat length, in a burst of generous indignation. \xe2\x80\x98My beloved husband, how\r\ndare they!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe caught her in his arms as she opened hers, and held her to his heart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even knowing this, you can trust me, Bella?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can trust you, John dear, with all my soul. If I could not trust you,\r\nI should fall dead at your feet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe kindling triumph in his face was bright indeed, as he looked up and\r\nrapturously exclaimed, what had he done to deserve the blessing of this\r\ndear confiding creature\xe2\x80\x99s heart! Again she put her hand upon his lips,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 and then told him, in her own little natural pathetic\r\nway, that if all the world were against him, she would be for him; that\r\nif all the world repudiated him, she would believe him; that if he were\r\ninfamous in other eyes, he would be honoured in hers; and that, under\r\nthe worst unmerited suspicion, she could devote her life to consoling\r\nhim, and imparting her own faith in him to their little child.\r\n\r\nA twilight calm of happiness then succeeding to their radiant noon, they\r\nremained at peace, until a strange voice in the room startled them both.\r\nThe room being by that time dark, the voice said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the lady\r\nbe alarmed by my striking a light,\xe2\x80\x99 and immediately a match rattled, and\r\nglimmered in a hand. The hand and the match and the voice were then seen\r\nby John Rokesmith to belong to Mr Inspector, once meditatively active in\r\nthis chronicle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I take the liberty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, in a business-like manner, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nbring myself to the recollection of Mr Julius Handford, who gave me his\r\nname and address down at our place a considerable time ago. Would the\r\nlady object to my lighting the pair of candles on the chimneypiece, to\r\nthrow a further light upon the subject? No? Thank you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Now, we\r\nlook cheerful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Inspector, in a dark-blue buttoned-up frock coat and pantaloons,\r\npresented a serviceable, half-pay, Royal Arms kind of appearance, as he\r\napplied his pocket handkerchief to his nose and bowed to the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You favoured me, Mr Handford,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98by writing down your\r\nname and address, and I produce the piece of paper on which you wrote\r\nit. Comparing the same with the writing on the fly-leaf of this book on\r\nthe table--and a sweet pretty volume it is--I find the writing of the\r\nentry, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs John Rokesmith. From her husband on her birthday\xe2\x80\x9d--and very\r\ngratifying to the feelings such memorials are--to correspond exactly.\r\nCan I have a word with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly. Here, if you please,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mr Inspector, again using his pocket handkerchief,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98though there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for the lady to be at all alarmed at, still,\r\nladies are apt to take alarm at matters of business--being of that\r\nfragile sex that they\xe2\x80\x99re not accustomed to them when not of a strictly\r\ndomestic character--and I do generally make it a rule to propose\r\nretirement from the presence of ladies, before entering upon business\r\ntopics. Or perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Inspector hinted, \xe2\x80\x98if the lady was to step\r\nup-stairs, and take a look at baby now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99--her husband was beginning; when Mr Inspector,\r\nregarding the words as an introduction, said, \xe2\x80\x98Happy I am sure, to have\r\nthe honour.\xe2\x80\x99 And bowed, with gallantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs Rokesmith,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed her husband, \xe2\x80\x98is satisfied that she can have no\r\nreason for being alarmed, whatever the business is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really? Is that so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s a sex to live and\r\nlearn from, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing a lady can\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish when she once\r\nfully gives her mind to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the case with my own wife. Well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nthis good gentleman of yours has given rise to a rather large amount\r\nof trouble which might have been avoided if he had come forward and\r\nexplained himself. Well you see! He DIDN\xe2\x80\x99T come forward and explain\r\nhimself. Consequently, now that we meet, him and me, you\xe2\x80\x99ll say--and say\r\nright--that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be alarmed at, in my proposing to him\r\nTO come forward--or, putting the same meaning in another form, to come\r\nalong with me--and explain himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Inspector put it in that other form, \xe2\x80\x98to come along with me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthere was a relishing roll in his voice, and his eye beamed with an\r\nofficial lustre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you propose to take me into custody?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired John Rokesmith, very\r\ncoolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why argue?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Inspector in a comfortable sort of\r\nremonstrance; \xe2\x80\x98ain\xe2\x80\x99t it enough that I propose that you shall come along\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For what reason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord bless my soul and body!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Inspector, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder at it in\r\na man of your education. Why argue?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you charge against me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder at you before a lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector, shaking his head\r\nreproachfully: \xe2\x80\x98I wonder, brought up as you have been, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nmore delicate mind! I charge you, then, with being some way concerned\r\nin the Harmon Murder. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say whether before, or in, or after, the\r\nfact. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say whether with having some knowledge of it that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. I foresaw your visit this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98Why, why argue? It\xe2\x80\x99s my duty to inform you\r\nthat whatever you say, will be used against you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I tell you it will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98Now, having received the\r\ncaution, do you still say that you foresaw my visit this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. And I will say something more, if you will step with me into the\r\nnext room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a reassuring kiss on the lips of the frightened Bella, her husband\r\n(to whom Mr Inspector obligingly offered his arm), took up a candle, and\r\nwithdrew with that gentleman. They were a full half-hour in conference.\r\nWhen they returned, Mr Inspector looked considerably astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have invited this worthy officer, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, \xe2\x80\x98to make a\r\nshort excursion with me in which you shall be a sharer. He will take\r\nsomething to eat and drink, I dare say, on your invitation, while you\r\nare getting your bonnet on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Inspector declined eating, but assented to the proposal of a glass of\r\nbrandy and water. Mixing this cold, and pensively consuming it, he broke\r\nat intervals into such soliloquies as that he never did know such a\r\nmove, that he never had been so gravelled, and that what a game was\r\nthis to try the sort of stuff a man\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of himself was made\r\nof! Concurrently with these comments, he more than once burst out a\r\nlaughing, with the half-enjoying and half-piqued air of a man, who\r\nhad given up a good conundrum, after much guessing, and been told the\r\nanswer. Bella was so timid of him, that she noted these things in a\r\nhalf-shrinking, half-perceptive way, and similarly noted that there was\r\na great change in his manner towards John. That coming-along-with-him\r\ndeportment was now lost in long musing looks at John and at herself and\r\nsometimes in slow heavy rubs of his hand across his forehead, as if he\r\nwere ironing cut the creases which his deep pondering made there. He had\r\nhad some coughing and whistling satellites secretly gravitating towards\r\nhim about the premises, but they were now dismissed, and he eyed John as\r\nif he had meant to do him a public service, but had unfortunately been\r\nanticipated. Whether Bella might have noted anything more, if she\r\nhad been less afraid of him, she could not determine; but it was all\r\ninexplicable to her, and not the faintest flash of the real state of the\r\ncase broke in upon her mind. Mr Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s increased notice of herself\r\nand knowing way of raising his eyebrows when their eyes by any chance\r\nmet, as if he put the question \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x99 augmented her timidity,\r\nand, consequently, her perplexity. For all these reasons, when he\r\nand she and John, at towards nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock of a winter evening went to\r\nLondon, and began driving from London Bridge, among low-lying water-side\r\nwharves and docks and strange places, Bella was in the state of a\r\ndreamer; perfectly unable to account for her being there, perfectly\r\nunable to forecast what would happen next, or whither she was going, or\r\nwhy; certain of nothing in the immediate present, but that she confided\r\nin John, and that John seemed somehow to be getting more triumphant. But\r\nwhat a certainty was that!\r\n\r\nThey alighted at last at the corner of a court, where there was a\r\nbuilding with a bright lamp and wicket gate. Its orderly appearance was\r\nvery unlike that of the surrounding neighbourhood, and was explained by\r\nthe inscription POLICE STATION.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are not going in here, John?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, clinging to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear; but of our own accord. We shall come out again as easily,\r\nnever fear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe whitewashed room was pure white as of old, the methodical\r\nbook-keeping was in peaceful progress as of old, and some distant howler\r\nwas banging against a cell door as of old. The sanctuary was not a\r\npermanent abiding-place, but a kind of criminal Pickford\xe2\x80\x99s. The lower\r\npassions and vices were regularly ticked off in the books, warehoused in\r\nthe cells, carted away as per accompanying invoice, and left little mark\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nMr Inspector placed two chairs for his visitors, before the fire, and\r\ncommuned in a low voice with a brother of his order (also of a half-pay,\r\nand Royal Arms aspect), who, judged only by his occupation at the\r\nmoment, might have been a writing-master, setting copies. Their\r\nconference done, Mr Inspector returned to the fireplace, and, having\r\nobserved that he would step round to the Fellowships and see how matters\r\nstood, went out. He soon came back again, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing could be\r\nbetter, for they\xe2\x80\x99re at supper with Miss Abbey in the bar;\xe2\x80\x99 and then they\r\nall three went out together.\r\n\r\nStill, as in a dream, Bella found herself entering a snug old-fashioned\r\npublic-house, and found herself smuggled into a little three-cornered\r\nroom nearly opposite the bar of that establishment. Mr Inspector\r\nachieved the smuggling of herself and John into this queer room, called\r\nCosy in an inscription on the door, by entering in the narrow passage\r\nfirst in order, and suddenly turning round upon them with extended arms,\r\nas if they had been two sheep. The room was lighted for their reception.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector to John, turning the gas lower; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll mix with\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em in a casual way, and when I say Identification, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll show\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn nodded, and Mr Inspector went alone to the half-door of the bar.\r\nFrom the dim doorway of Cosy, within which Bella and her husband stood,\r\nthey could see a comfortable little party of three persons sitting at\r\nsupper in the bar, and could hear everything that was said.\r\n\r\nThe three persons were Miss Abbey and two male guests. To whom\r\ncollectively, Mr Inspector remarked that the weather was getting sharp\r\nfor the time of year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It need be sharp to suit your wits, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey. \xe2\x80\x98What have\r\nyou got in hand now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanking you for your compliment: not much, Miss Abbey,\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr\r\nInspector\xe2\x80\x99s rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who have you got in Cosy?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Miss Abbey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a gentleman and his wife, Miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And who are they? If one may ask it without detriment to your deep\r\nplans in the interests of the honest public?\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, proud of\r\nMr Inspector as an administrative genius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are strangers in this part of the town, Miss Abbey. They are\r\nwaiting till I shall want the gentleman to show himself somewhere, for\r\nhalf a moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you join us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Inspector immediately slipped into the bar, and sat down at the side\r\nof the half-door, with his back towards the passage, and directly facing\r\nthe two guests. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t take my supper till later in the night,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98and therefore I won\xe2\x80\x99t disturb the compactness of the table. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass of flip, if that\xe2\x80\x99s flip in the jug in the fender.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s flip,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98and it\xe2\x80\x99s my making, and if even you\r\ncan find out better, I shall be glad to know where.\xe2\x80\x99 Filling him, with\r\nhospitable hands, a steaming tumbler, Miss Abbey replaced the jug by\r\nthe fire; the company not having yet arrived at the flip-stage of their\r\nsupper, but being as yet skirmishing with strong ale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--h!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the smack! There\xe2\x80\x99s not a Detective\r\nin the Force, Miss Abbey, that could find out better stuff than that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad to hear you say so,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Miss Abbey. \xe2\x80\x98You ought to know, if\r\nanybody does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Job Potterson,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Inspector continued, \xe2\x80\x98I drink your health. Mr\r\nJacob Kibble, I drink yours. Hope you have made a prosperous voyage\r\nhome, gentlemen both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Kibble, an unctuous broad man of few words and many mouthfuls, said,\r\nmore briefly than pointedly, raising his ale to his lips: \xe2\x80\x98Same to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nMr Job Potterson, a semi-seafaring man of obliging demeanour, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord bless my soul and body!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98Talk of trades, Miss\r\nAbbey, and the way they set their marks on men\xe2\x80\x99 (a subject which nobody\r\nhad approached); \xe2\x80\x98who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know your brother to be a Steward!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bright and ready twinkle in his eye, there\xe2\x80\x99s a neatness in his\r\naction, there\xe2\x80\x99s a smartness in his figure, there\xe2\x80\x99s an air of reliability\r\nabout him in case you wanted a basin, which points out the steward! And\r\nMr Kibble; ain\xe2\x80\x99t he Passenger, all over? While there\xe2\x80\x99s that mercantile\r\ncut upon him which would make you happy to give him credit for five\r\nhundred pound, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the salt sea shining on him too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98YOU do, I dare say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Abbey, \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t. And as for\r\nstewarding, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time my brother gave that up, and took his\r\nHouse in hand on his sister\xe2\x80\x99s retiring. The House will go to pieces if\r\nhe don\xe2\x80\x99t. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell it for any money that could be told out, to a\r\nperson that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t depend upon to be a Law to the Porters, as I have\r\nbeen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Miss,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector. \xe2\x80\x98A better kept house is\r\nnot known to our men. What do I say? Half so well a kept house is not\r\nknown to our men. Show the Force the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters,\r\nand the Force--to a constable--will show you a piece of perfection, Mr\r\nKibble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat gentleman, with a very serious shake of his head, subscribed the\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And talk of Time slipping by you, as if it was an animal at rustic\r\nsports with its tail soaped,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Inspector (again, a subject which\r\nnobody had approached); \xe2\x80\x98why, well you may. Well you may. How has it\r\nslipped by us, since the time when Mr Job Potterson here present, Mr\r\nJacob Kibble here present, and an Officer of the Force here present,\r\nfirst came together on a matter of Identification!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella\xe2\x80\x99s husband stepped softly to the half-door of the bar, and stood\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How has Time slipped by us,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Inspector went on slowly, with his eyes\r\nnarrowly observant of the two guests, \xe2\x80\x98since we three very men, at an\r\nInquest in this very house--Mr Kibble? Taken ill, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Kibble had staggered up, with his lower jaw dropped, catching\r\nPotterson by the shoulder, and pointing to the half-door. He now cried\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x98Potterson! Look! Look there!\xe2\x80\x99 Potterson started up, started back,\r\nand exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x98Heaven defend us, what\xe2\x80\x99s that!\xe2\x80\x99 Bella\xe2\x80\x99s husband stepped\r\nback to Bella, took her in his arms (for she was terrified by the\r\nunintelligible terror of the two men), and shut the door of the little\r\nroom. A hurry of voices succeeded, in which Mr Inspector\xe2\x80\x99s voice was\r\nbusiest; it gradually slackened and sank; and Mr Inspector reappeared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sharp\xe2\x80\x99s the word, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking in with a knowing wink. \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget your lady out at once.\xe2\x80\x99 Immediately, Bella and her husband were\r\nunder the stars, making their way back, alone, to the vehicle they had\r\nkept in waiting.\r\n\r\nAll this was most extraordinary, and Bella could make nothing of it but\r\nthat John was in the right. How in the right, and how suspected of being\r\nin the wrong, she could not divine. Some vague idea that he had never\r\nreally assumed the name of Handford, and that there was a remarkable\r\nlikeness between him and that mysterious person, was her nearest\r\napproach to any definite explanation. But John was triumphant; that much\r\nwas made apparent; and she could wait for the rest.\r\n\r\nWhen John came home to dinner next day, he said, sitting down on the\r\nsofa by Bella and baby-Bella: \xe2\x80\x98My dear, I have a piece of news to tell\r\nyou. I have left the China House.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he seemed to like having left it, Bella took it for granted that\r\nthere was no misfortune in the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a word, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, \xe2\x80\x98the China House is broken up and\r\nabolished. There is no such thing any more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, are you already in another House, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my darling. I am in another way of business. And I am rather\r\nbetter off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible baby was instantly made to congratulate him, and\r\nto say, with appropriate action on the part of a very limp arm and a\r\nspeckled fist: \xe2\x80\x98Three cheers, ladies and gemplemorums. Hoo--ray!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid, my life,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, \xe2\x80\x98that you have become very much\r\nattached to this cottage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Afraid I have, John? Of course I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The reason why I said afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 returned John, \xe2\x80\x98is, because we must\r\nmove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O John!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear, we must move. We must have our head-quarters in London\r\nnow. In short, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dwelling-house rent-free, attached to my new\r\nposition, and we must occupy it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a gain, John.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear, it is undoubtedly a gain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gave her a very blithe look, and a very sly look. Which occasioned\r\nthe inexhaustible baby to square at him with the speckled fists, and\r\ndemand in a threatening manner what he meant?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love, you said it was a gain, and I said it was a gain. A very\r\ninnocent remark, surely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said the inexhaustible baby,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--allow--you--to--make--game--of--my--venerable--Ma.\xe2\x80\x99 At each division\r\nadministering a soft facer with one of the speckled fists.\r\n\r\nJohn having stooped down to receive these punishing visitations, Bella\r\nasked him, would it be necessary to move soon? Why yes, indeed (said\r\nJohn), he did propose that they should move very soon. Taking the\r\nfurniture with them, of course? (said Bella). Why, no (said John), the\r\nfact was, that the house was--in a sort of a kind of a way--furnished\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nThe inexhaustible baby, hearing this, resumed the offensive, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there\xe2\x80\x99s no nursery for me, sir. What do you mean, marble-hearted\r\nparent?\xe2\x80\x99 To which the marble-hearted parent rejoined that there was\r\na--sort of a kind of a--nursery, and it might be \xe2\x80\x98made to do\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x98Made to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x99 returned the Inexhaustible, administering more punishment, \xe2\x80\x98what do\r\nyou take me for?\xe2\x80\x99 And was then turned over on its back in Bella\xe2\x80\x99s lap,\r\nand smothered with kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But really, John dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, flushed in quite a lovely manner\r\nby these exercises, \xe2\x80\x98will the new house, just as it stands, do for baby?\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I felt that to be the question,\xe2\x80\x99 he returned, \xe2\x80\x98and therefore I arranged\r\nthat you should come with me and look at it, to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAppointment made, accordingly, for Bella to go up with him to-morrow\r\nmorning; John kissed; and Bella delighted.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached London in pursuance of their little plan, they took\r\ncoach and drove westward. Not only drove westward, but drove into that\r\nparticular westward division, which Bella had seen last when she turned\r\nher face from Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s door. Not only drove into that particular\r\ndivision, but drove at last into that very street. Not only drove into\r\nthat very street, but stopped at last at that very house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John dear!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, looking out of window in a flutter. \xe2\x80\x98Do you\r\nsee where we are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, my love. The coachman\xe2\x80\x99s quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe house-door was opened without any knocking or ringing, and John\r\npromptly helped her out. The servant who stood holding the door, asked\r\nno question of John, neither did he go before them or follow them as\r\nthey went straight up-stairs. It was only her husband\xe2\x80\x99s encircling arm,\r\nurging her on, that prevented Bella from stopping at the foot of the\r\nstaircase. As they ascended, it was seen to be tastefully ornamented\r\nwith most beautiful flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O John!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, faintly. \xe2\x80\x98What does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, my darling, nothing. Let us go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGoing on a little higher, they came to a charming aviary, in which a\r\nnumber of tropical birds, more gorgeous in colour than the flowers,\r\nwere flying about; and among those birds were gold and silver fish, and\r\nmosses, and water-lilies, and a fountain, and all manner of wonders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O my dear John!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98What does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, my darling, nothing. Let us go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went on, until they came to a door. As John put out his hand to\r\nopen it, Bella caught his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means, but it\xe2\x80\x99s too much for me. Hold me, John,\r\nlove.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJohn caught her up in his arm, and lightly dashed into the room with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBehold Mr and Mrs Boffin, beaming! Behold Mrs Boffin clapping her hands\r\nin an ecstacy, running to Bella with tears of joy pouring down her\r\ncomely face, and folding her to her breast, with the words: \xe2\x80\x98My deary\r\ndeary, deary girl, that Noddy and me saw married and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish joy\r\nto, or so much as speak to! My deary, deary, deary, wife of John and\r\nmother of his little child! My loving loving, bright bright, Pretty\r\nPretty! Welcome to your house and home, my deary!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN HELPED TO SCATTER DUST\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the first bewilderment of her wonder, the most bewilderingly\r\nwonderful thing to Bella was the shining countenance of Mr Boffin. That\r\nhis wife should be joyous, open-hearted, and genial, or that her face\r\nshould express every quality that was large and trusting, and no quality\r\nthat was little or mean, was accordant with Bella\xe2\x80\x99s experience. But,\r\nthat he, with a perfectly beneficent air and a plump rosy face, should\r\nbe standing there, looking at her and John, like some jovial good\r\nspirit, was marvellous. For, how had he looked when she last saw him in\r\nthat very room (it was the room in which she had given him that piece of\r\nher mind at parting), and what had become of all those crooked lines of\r\nsuspicion, avarice, and distrust, that twisted his visage then?\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin seated Bella on the large ottoman, and seated herself beside\r\nher, and John her husband seated himself on the other side of her, and\r\nMr Boffin stood beaming at every one and everything he could see, with\r\nsurpassing jollity and enjoyment. Mrs Boffin was then taken with a\r\nlaughing fit of clapping her hands, and clapping her knees, and rocking\r\nherself to and fro, and then with another laughing fit of embracing\r\nBella, and rocking her to and fro--both fits, of considerable duration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old lady, old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, at length; \xe2\x80\x98if you don\xe2\x80\x99t begin\r\nsomebody else must.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a going to begin, Noddy, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Only it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t easy for a person to know where to begin, when a person is in this\r\nstate of delight and happiness. Bella, my dear. Tell me, who\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is this?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bella. \xe2\x80\x98My husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! But tell me his name, deary!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rokesmith.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, clapping her hands, and shaking her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x98Not a bit of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Handford then,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, again clapping her hands and shaking\r\nher head. \xe2\x80\x98Not a bit of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At least, his name is John, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I should think so, deary!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98I should hope so!\r\nMany and many is the time I have called him by his name of John. But\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s his other name, his true other name? Give a guess, my pretty!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, turning her pale face from one to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98and what\xe2\x80\x99s more, I did! I found him out,\r\nall in a flash as I may say, one night. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Noddy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! That the old lady did!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, with stout pride in the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harkee to me, deary,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mrs Boffin, taking Bella\xe2\x80\x99s hands between\r\nher own, and gently beating on them from time to time. \xe2\x80\x98It was after a\r\nparticular night when John had been disappointed--as he thought--in\r\nhis affections. It was after a night when John had made an offer to a\r\ncertain young lady, and the certain young lady had refused it. It was\r\nafter a particular night, when he felt himself cast-away-like, and had\r\nmade up his mind to go seek his fortune. It was the very next night. My\r\nNoddy wanted a paper out of his Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s room, and I says to Noddy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going by the door, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him for it.\xe2\x80\x9d I tapped at his door,\r\nand he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear me. I looked in, and saw him a sitting lonely by his\r\nfire, brooding over it. He chanced to look up with a pleased kind of\r\nsmile in my company when he saw me, and then in a single moment every\r\ngrain of the gunpowder that had been lying sprinkled thick about him\r\never since I first set eyes upon him as a man at the Bower, took fire!\r\nToo many a time had I seen him sitting lonely, when he was a poor child,\r\nto be pitied, heart and hand! Too many a time had I seen him in need of\r\nbeing brightened up with a comforting word! Too many and too many a time\r\nto be mistaken, when that glimpse of him come at last! No, no! I just\r\nmakes out to cry, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you now! You\xe2\x80\x99re John!\xe2\x80\x9d And he catches me as\r\nI drops.--So what,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mrs Boffin, breaking off in the rush of her\r\nspeech to smile most radiantly, \xe2\x80\x98might you think by this time that your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s name was, dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, with quivering lips; \xe2\x80\x98not Harmon? That\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\npossible?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tremble. Why not possible, deary, when so many things are\r\npossible?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Mrs Boffin, in a soothing tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was killed,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thought to be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98But if ever John Harmon drew the\r\nbreath of life on earth, that is certainly John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s arm round your\r\nwaist now, my pretty. If ever John Harmon had a wife on earth, that wife\r\nis certainly you. If ever John Harmon and his wife had a child on earth,\r\nthat child is certainly this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy a master-stroke of secret arrangement, the inexhaustible baby here\r\nappeared at the door, suspended in mid-air by invisible agency. Mrs\r\nBoffin, plunging at it, brought it to Bella\xe2\x80\x99s lap, where both Mrs and Mr\r\nBoffin (as the saying is) \xe2\x80\x98took it out of\xe2\x80\x99 the Inexhaustible in a shower\r\nof caresses. It was only this timely appearance that kept Bella from\r\nswooning. This, and her husband\xe2\x80\x99s earnestness in explaining further to\r\nher how it had come to pass that he had been supposed to be slain, and\r\nhad even been suspected of his own murder; also, how he had put a pious\r\nfraud upon her which had preyed upon his mind, as the time for its\r\ndisclosure approached, lest she might not make full allowance for\r\nthe object with which it had originated, and in which it had fully\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But bless ye, my beauty!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, taking him up short at this\r\npoint, with another hearty clap of her hands. \xe2\x80\x98It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t John only that\r\nwas in it. We was all of us in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, looking vacantly from one to another, \xe2\x80\x98yet\r\nunderstand--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t, my deary,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98How can you till\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re told! So now I am a going to tell you. So you put your two hands\r\nbetween my two hands again,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the comfortable creature, embracing\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x98with that blessed little picter lying on your lap, and you shall\r\nbe told all the story. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m a going to tell the story. Once, twice,\r\nthree times, and the horses is off. Here they go! When I cries out that\r\nnight, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you now, you\xe2\x80\x99re John!\xe2\x80\x9d--which was my exact words; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey, John?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your exact words,\xe2\x80\x99 said John, laying his hand on hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a very good arrangement,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Keep it there,\r\nJohn. And as we was all of us in it, Noddy you come and lay yours a top\r\nof his, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t break the pile till the story\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin hitched up a chair, and added his broad brown right hand to\r\nthe heap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s capital!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, giving it a kiss. \xe2\x80\x98Seems quite a\r\nfamily building; don\xe2\x80\x99t it? But the horses is off. Well! When I cries\r\nout that night, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you now! you\xe2\x80\x99re John!\xe2\x80\x9d John catches of me, it\r\nis true; but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a light weight, bless ye, and he\xe2\x80\x99s forced to let me\r\ndown. Noddy, he hears a noise, and in he trots, and as soon as I anyways\r\ncomes to myself I calls to him, \xe2\x80\x9cNoddy, well I might say as I did say,\r\nthat night at the Bower, for the Lord be thankful this is John!\xe2\x80\x9d On\r\nwhich he gives a heave, and down he goes likewise, with his head under\r\nthe writing-table. This brings me round comfortable, and that brings him\r\nround comfortable, and then John and him and me we all fall a crying for\r\njoy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes! They cry for joy, my darling,\xe2\x80\x99 her husband struck in. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nunderstand? These two, whom I come to life to disappoint and dispossess,\r\ncry for joy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella looked at him confusedly, and looked again at Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s radiant\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right, my dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98stick\r\nto me. Well! Then we sits down, gradually gets cool, and holds a\r\nconfabulation. John, he tells us how he is despairing in his mind on\r\naccounts of a certain fair young person, and how, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t found him\r\nout, he was going away to seek his fortune far and wide, and had fully\r\nmeant never to come to life, but to leave the property as our wrongful\r\ninheritance for ever and a day. At which you never see a man so\r\nfrightened as my Noddy was. For to think that he should have come into\r\nthe property wrongful, however innocent, and--more than that--might have\r\ngone on keeping it to his dying day, turned him whiter than chalk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you too,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind him, neither, my deary,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Mrs Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98stick\r\nto me. This brings up a confabulation regarding the certain fair young\r\nperson; when Noddy he gives it as his opinion that she is a deary\r\ncreetur. \xe2\x80\x9cShe may be a leetle spoilt, and nat\xe2\x80\x99rally spoilt,\xe2\x80\x9d he says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cby circumstances, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only the surface, and I lay my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she\xe2\x80\x99s the true golden gold at heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So did you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind him a single morsel, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Mrs Boffin,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but stick to me. Then says John, O, if he could but prove so! Then we\r\nboth of us ups and says, that minute, \xe2\x80\x9cProve so!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a start, Bella directed a hurried glance towards Mr Boffin. But,\r\nhe was sitting thoughtfully smiling at that broad brown hand of his, and\r\neither didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it, or would take no notice of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cProve it, John!\xe2\x80\x9d we says,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cProve it and\r\novercome your doubts with triumph, and be happy for the first time in\r\nyour life, and for the rest of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d This puts John in a state,\r\nto be sure. Then we says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will content you? If she was to stand up\r\nfor you when you was slighted, if she was to show herself of a generous\r\nmind when you was oppressed, if she was to be truest to you when you was\r\npoorest and friendliest, and all this against her own seeming interest,\r\nhow would that do?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo?\xe2\x80\x9d says John, \xe2\x80\x9cit would raise me to the skies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d says my Noddy, \xe2\x80\x9cmake your preparations for the ascent, John, it\r\nbeing my firm belief that up you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella caught Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s twinkling eye for half an instant; but he got\r\nit away from her, and restored it to his broad brown hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From the first, you was always a special favourite of Noddy\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs Boffin, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x98O you were! And if I had been inclined\r\nto be jealous, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t have done to you. But as I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t--why, my beauty,\xe2\x80\x99 with a hearty laugh and an embrace, \xe2\x80\x98I made you\r\na special favourite of my own too. But the horses is coming round the\r\ncorner. Well! Then says my Noddy, shaking his sides till he was fit to\r\nmake \xe2\x80\x98em ache again: \xe2\x80\x9cLook out for being slighted and oppressed, John,\r\nfor if ever a man had a hard master, you shall find me from this present\r\ntime to be such to you.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he began!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs Boffin, in an\r\necstacy of admiration. \xe2\x80\x98Lord bless you, then he began! And how he DID\r\nbegin; didn\xe2\x80\x99t he!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella looked half frightened, and yet half laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, bless you,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98if you could have seen him of a\r\nnight, at that time of it! The way he\xe2\x80\x99d sit and chuckle over himself!\r\nThe way he\xe2\x80\x99d say \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a regular brown bear to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d and take\r\nhimself in his arms and hug himself at the thoughts of the brute he had\r\npretended. But every night he says to me: \xe2\x80\x9cBetter and better, old lady.\r\nWhat did we say of her? She\xe2\x80\x99ll come through it, the true golden gold.\r\nThis\xe2\x80\x99ll be the happiest piece of work we ever done.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he\xe2\x80\x99d say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be a grislier old growler to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d and laugh, he would, till\r\nJohn and me was often forced to slap his back, and bring it out of his\r\nwindpipes with a little water.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, with his face bent over his heavy hand, made no sound,\r\nbut rolled his shoulders when thus referred to, as if he were vastly\r\nenjoying himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so, my good and pretty,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mrs Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98you was married, and\r\nthere was we hid up in the church-organ by this husband of yours; for\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let us out with it then, as was first meant. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s so unselfish and contented, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be rich yet. I\r\nmust wait a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, when baby was expected, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nis such a cheerful, glorious housewife that I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be rich\r\nyet. I must wait a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d Then when baby was born, he says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is so much better than she ever was, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be rich\r\nyet. I must wait a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d And so he goes on and on, till I says\r\noutright, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, John, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t fix a time for setting her up in her\r\nown house and home, and letting us walk out of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn Informer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then he says he\xe2\x80\x99ll only wait to triumph beyond what we ever thought\r\npossible, and to show her to us better than even we ever supposed; and\r\nhe says, \xe2\x80\x9cShe shall see me under suspicion of having murdered myself,\r\nand YOU shall see how trusting and how true she\xe2\x80\x99ll be.\xe2\x80\x9d Well! Noddy and\r\nme agreed to that, and he was right, and here you are, and the horses is\r\nin, and the story is done, and God bless you my Beauty, and God bless us\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe pile of hands dispersed, and Bella and Mrs Boffin took a good long\r\nhug of one another: to the apparent peril of the inexhaustible baby,\r\nlying staring in Bella\xe2\x80\x99s lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But IS the story done?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, pondering. \xe2\x80\x98Is there no more of\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What more of it should there be, deary?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin, full of\r\nglee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure you have left nothing out of it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin, archly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a good nurse; will you please hold\r\nbaby?\xe2\x80\x99 Having deposited the Inexhaustible in his arms with those words,\r\nBella looked hard at Mr Boffin, who had moved to a table where he was\r\nleaning his head upon his hand with his face turned away, and, quietly\r\nsettling herself on her knees at his side, and drawing one arm over his\r\nshoulder, said: \xe2\x80\x98Please I beg your pardon, and I made a small mistake of\r\na word when I took leave of you last. Please I think you are better (not\r\nworse) than Hopkins, better (not worse) than Dancer, better (not worse)\r\nthan Blackberry Jones, better (not worse) than any of them! Please\r\nsomething more!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, with an exultant ringing laugh as she\r\nstruggled with him and forced him to turn his delighted face to hers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please I have found out something not yet mentioned. Please I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve you are a hard-hearted miser at all, and please I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nyou ever for one single minute were!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this, Mrs Boffin fairly screamed with rapture, and sat beating her\r\nfeet upon the floor, clapping her hands, and bobbing herself backwards\r\nand forwards, like a demented member of some Mandarin\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I understand you now, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I want neither you nor any\r\none else to tell me the rest of the story. I can tell it to YOU, now, if\r\nyou would like to hear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Tell it then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, holding him prisoner by the coat with both hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you saw what a greedy little wretch you were the patron of, you\r\ndetermined to show her how much misused and misprized riches could\r\ndo, and often had done, to spoil people; did you? Not caring what she\r\nthought of you (and Goodness knows THAT was of no consequence!) you\r\nshowed her, in yourself, the most detestable sides of wealth, saying in\r\nyour own mind, \xe2\x80\x9cThis shallow creature would never work the truth out of\r\nher own weak soul, if she had a hundred years to do it in; but a glaring\r\ninstance kept before her may open even her eyes and set her thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n That was what you said to yourself, was it, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never said anything of the sort,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Boffin declared in a state of\r\nthe highest enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you ought to have said it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella, giving him two\r\npulls and one kiss, \xe2\x80\x98for you must have thought and meant it. You saw\r\nthat good fortune was turning my stupid head and hardening my silly\r\nheart--was making me grasping, calculating, insolent, insufferable--and\r\nyou took the pains to be the dearest and kindest fingerpost that ever\r\nwas set up anywhere, pointing out the road that I was taking and the end\r\nit led to. Confess instantly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98John,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, one broad piece of sunshine from head to foot,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d help me out of this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t be heard by counsel, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bella. \xe2\x80\x98You must speak\r\nfor yourself. Confess instantly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98the truth is, that when we did go in\r\nfor the little scheme that my old lady has pinted out, I did put it to\r\nJohn, what did he think of going in for some such general scheme as YOU\r\nhave pinted out? But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t in any way so word it, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\nany way so mean it. I only said to John, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be more consistent,\r\nme going in for being a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar brown bear respecting him, to go in as a\r\nreg\xe2\x80\x99lar brown bear all round?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confess this minute, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that you did it to correct and\r\namend me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, my dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it to harm you;\r\nyou may be sure of that. And I did hope it might just hint a caution.\r\nStill, it ought to be mentioned that no sooner had my old lady found out\r\nJohn, than John made known to her and me that he had had his eye upon a\r\nthankless person by the name of Silas Wegg. Partly for the punishment of\r\nwhich Wegg, by leading him on in a very unhandsome and underhanded\r\ngame that he was playing, them books that you and me bought so many\r\nof together (and, by-the-by, my dear, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Blackberry Jones, but\r\nBlewberry) was read aloud to me by that person of the name of Silas Wegg\r\naforesaid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBella, who was still on her knees at Mr Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s feet, gradually sank\r\ndown into a sitting posture on the ground, as she meditated more and\r\nmore thoughtfully, with her eyes upon his beaming face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella, after this meditative pause, \xe2\x80\x98there remain two\r\nthings that I cannot understand. Mrs Boffin never supposed any part of\r\nthe change in Mr Boffin to be real; did she?--You never did; did you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked Bella, turning to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs Boffin, with a most rotund and glowing negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet you took it very much to heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bella. \xe2\x80\x98I remember its\r\nmaking you very uneasy, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ecod, you see Mrs John has a sharp eye, John!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Boffin, shaking\r\nhis head with an admiring air. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re right, my dear. The old lady\r\nnearly blowed us into shivers and smithers, many times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bella. \xe2\x80\x98How did that happen, when she was in your secret?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, it was a weakness in the old lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98and yet, to\r\ntell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99m rather proud of\r\nit. My dear, the old lady thinks so high of me that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abear\r\nto see and hear me coming out as a reg\xe2\x80\x99lar brown one. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abear\r\nto make-believe as I meant it! In consequence of which, we was\r\neverlastingly in danger with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin laughed heartily at herself; but a certain glistening in her\r\nhonest eyes revealed that she was by no means cured of that dangerous\r\npropensity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, \xe2\x80\x98that on the celebrated\r\nday when I made what has since been agreed upon to be my grandest\r\ndemonstration--I allude to Mew says the cat, Quack quack says the\r\nduck, and Bow-wow-wow says the dog--I assure you, my dear, that on that\r\ncelebrated day, them flinty and unbelieving words hit my old lady so hard\r\non my account, that I had to hold her, to prevent her running out after\r\nyou, and defending me by saying I was playing a part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Boffin laughed heartily again, and her eyes glistened again, and\r\nit then appeared, not only that in that burst of sarcastic eloquence\r\nMr Boffin was considered by his two fellow-conspirators to have outdone\r\nhimself, but that in his own opinion it was a remarkable achievement.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never thought of it afore the moment, my dear!\xe2\x80\x99 he observed to Bella.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When John said, if he had been so happy as to win your affections and\r\npossess your heart, it come into my head to turn round upon him with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWin her affections and possess her heart! Mew says the cat, Quack quack\r\nsays the duck, and Bow-wow-wow says the dog.\xe2\x80\x9d I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how\r\nit come into my head or where from, but it had so much the sound of a\r\nrasper that I own to you it astonished myself. I was awful nigh bursting\r\nout a laughing though, when it made John stare!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said, my pretty,\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Boffin reminded Bella, \xe2\x80\x98that there was one\r\nother thing you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bella, covering her face with her hands; \xe2\x80\x98but that I\r\nnever shall be able to understand as long as I live. It is, how John\r\ncould love me so when I so little deserved it, and how you, Mr and Mrs\r\nBoffin, could be so forgetful of yourselves, and take such pains and\r\ntrouble, to make me a little better, and after all to help him to so\r\nunworthy a wife. But I am very very grateful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s turn then--John Harmon now for good, and John\r\nRokesmith for nevermore--to plead with her (quite unnecessarily) in\r\nbehalf of his deception, and to tell her, over and over again, that it\r\nhad been prolonged by her own winning graces in her supposed station of\r\nlife. This led on to many interchanges of endearment and enjoyment\r\non all sides, in the midst of which the Inexhaustible being observed\r\nstaring, in a most imbecile manner, on Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s breast, was\r\npronounced to be supernaturally intelligent as to the whole transaction,\r\nand was made to declare to the ladies and gemplemorums, with a wave of\r\nthe speckled fist (with difficulty detached from an exceedingly short\r\nwaist), \xe2\x80\x98I have already informed my venerable Ma that I know all about\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen, said John Harmon, would Mrs John Harmon come and see her house?\r\nAnd a dainty house it was, and a tastefully beautiful; and they went\r\nthrough it in procession; the Inexhaustible on Mrs Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s bosom (still\r\nstaring) occupying the middle station, and Mr Boffin bringing up the\r\nrear. And on Bella\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite toilette table was an ivory casket, and\r\nin the casket were jewels the like of which she had never dreamed of,\r\nand aloft on an upper floor was a nursery garnished as with rainbows;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98though we were hard put to it,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Harmon, \xe2\x80\x98to get it done in so\r\nshort a time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe house inspected, emissaries removed the Inexhaustible, who was\r\nshortly afterwards heard screaming among the rainbows; whereupon Bella\r\nwithdrew herself from the presence and knowledge of gemplemorums, and\r\nthe screaming ceased, and smiling Peace associated herself with that\r\nyoung olive branch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come and look in, Noddy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Boffin to Mr Boffin.\r\n\r\nMr Boffin, submitting to be led on tiptoe to the nursery door, looked in\r\nwith immense satisfaction, although there was nothing to see but Bella\r\nin a musing state of happiness, seated in a little low chair upon the\r\nhearth, with her child in her fair young arms, and her soft eyelashes\r\nshading her eyes from the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It looks as if the old man\xe2\x80\x99s spirit had found rest at last; don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs Boffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, old lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as if his money had turned bright again, after a long long rust in\r\nthe dark, and was at last a beginning to sparkle in the sunlight?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, old lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it makes a pretty and a promising picter; don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, old lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, aware at the instant of a fine opening for a point, Mr Boffin\r\nquenched that observation in this--delivered in the grisliest growling\r\nof the regular brown bear. \xe2\x80\x98A pretty and a hopeful picter? Mew,\r\nQuack quack, Bow-wow!\xe2\x80\x99 And then trotted silently downstairs, with his\r\nshoulders in a state of the liveliest commotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\nCHECKMATE TO THE FRIENDLY MOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs John Harmon had so timed their taking possession of their\r\nrightful name and their London house, that the event befel on the very\r\nday when the last waggon-load of the last Mound was driven out at the\r\ngates of Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s Bower. As it jolted away, Mr Wegg felt that the\r\nlast load was correspondingly removed from his mind, and hailed the\r\nauspicious season when that black sheep, Boffin, was to be closely\r\nsheared.\r\n\r\nOver the whole slow process of levelling the Mounds, Silas had kept\r\nwatch with rapacious eyes. But, eyes no less rapacious had watched the\r\ngrowth of the Mounds in years bygone, and had vigilantly sifted the dust\r\nof which they were composed. No valuables turned up. How should there\r\nbe any, seeing that the old hard jailer of Harmony Jail had coined every\r\nwaif and stray into money, long before?\r\n\r\nThough disappointed by this bare result, Mr Wegg felt too sensibly\r\nrelieved by the close of the labour, to grumble to any great extent.\r\nA foreman-representative of the dust contractors, purchasers of the\r\nMounds, had worn Mr Wegg down to skin and bone. This supervisor of the\r\nproceedings, asserting his employers\xe2\x80\x99 rights to cart off by daylight,\r\nnightlight, torchlight, when they would, must have been the death of\r\nSilas if the work had lasted much longer. Seeming never to need sleep\r\nhimself, he would reappear, with a tied-up broken head, in fantail hat\r\nand velveteen smalls, like an accursed goblin, at the most unholy and\r\nuntimely hours. Tired out by keeping close ward over a long day\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\nin fog and rain, Silas would have just crawled to bed and be dozing,\r\nwhen a horrid shake and rumble under his pillow would announce an\r\napproaching train of carts, escorted by this Demon of Unrest, to fall to\r\nwork again. At another time, he would be rumbled up out of his soundest\r\nsleep, in the dead of the night; at another, would be kept at his post\r\neight-and-forty hours on end. The more his persecutor besought him not\r\nto trouble himself to turn out, the more suspicious was the crafty Wegg\r\nthat indications had been observed of something hidden somewhere, and\r\nthat attempts were on foot to circumvent him. So continually broken was\r\nhis rest through these means, that he led the life of having wagered\r\nto keep ten thousand dog-watches in ten thousand hours, and looked\r\npiteously upon himself as always getting up and yet never going to bed.\r\nSo gaunt and haggard had he grown at last, that his wooden leg showed\r\ndisproportionate, and presented a thriving appearance in contrast\r\nwith the rest of his plagued body, which might almost have been termed\r\nchubby.\r\n\r\nHowever, Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s comfort was, that all his disagreeables were now over,\r\nand that he was immediately coming into his property. Of late, the\r\ngrindstone did undoubtedly appear to have been whirling at his own nose\r\nrather than Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s, but Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s nose was now to be sharpened fine.\r\nThus far, Mr Wegg had let his dusty friend off lightly, having been\r\nbaulked in that amiable design of frequently dining with him, by the\r\nmachinations of the sleepless dustman. He had been constrained to depute\r\nMr Venus to keep their dusty friend, Boffin, under inspection, while he\r\nhimself turned lank and lean at the Bower.\r\n\r\nTo Mr Venus\xe2\x80\x99s museum Mr Wegg repaired when at length the Mounds\r\nwere down and gone. It being evening, he found that gentleman, as he\r\nexpected, seated over his fire; but did not find him, as he expected,\r\nfloating his powerful mind in tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you smell rather comfortable here!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, seeming to take it\r\nill, and stopping and sniffing as he entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I AM rather comfortable, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t use lemon in your business, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Wegg, sniffing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus. \xe2\x80\x98When I use it at all, I mostly use it in\r\ncobblers\xe2\x80\x99 punch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you call cobblers\xe2\x80\x99 punch?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded Wegg, in a worse humour\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to impart the receipt for it, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because, however particular you may be in allotting your materials,\r\nso much will still depend upon the individual gifts, and there being a\r\nfeeling thrown into it. But the groundwork is gin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a Dutch bottle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg gloomily, as he sat himself down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, sir, very good!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Will you partake, sir?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will I partake?\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg very surlily. \xe2\x80\x98Why, of course I will!\r\nWILL a man partake, as has been tormented out of his five senses by\r\nan everlasting dustman with his head tied up! WILL he, too! As if he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it put you out, Mr Wegg. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem in your usual\r\nspirits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you come to that, you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem in your usual spirits,\xe2\x80\x99 growled\r\nWegg. \xe2\x80\x98You seem to be setting up for lively.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis circumstance appeared, in his then state of mind, to give Mr Wegg\r\nuncommon offence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having your hair cut!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, missing the usual\r\ndusty shock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr Wegg. But don\xe2\x80\x99t let that put you out, either.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I am blest if you ain\xe2\x80\x99t getting fat!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, with culminating\r\ndiscontent. \xe2\x80\x98What are you going to do next?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, smiling in a sprightly manner, \xe2\x80\x98I suspect\r\nyou could hardly guess what I am going to do next.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to guess,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98All I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say is, that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s well for you that the diwision of labour has been what it has been.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s well for you to have had so light a part in this business, when\r\nmine has been so heavy. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t had YOUR rest broke, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus. \xe2\x80\x98Never rested so well in all my life, I\r\nthank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98you should have been me. If you had been me, and\r\nhad been fretted out of your bed, and your sleep, and your meals, and\r\nyour mind, for a stretch of months together, you\xe2\x80\x99d have been out of\r\ncondition and out of sorts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, it has trained you down, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, contemplating\r\nhis figure with an artist\xe2\x80\x99s eye. \xe2\x80\x98Trained you down very low, it has! So\r\nweazen and yellow is the kivering upon your bones, that one might almost\r\nfancy you had come to give a look-in upon the French gentleman in the\r\ncorner, instead of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg, glancing in great dudgeon towards the French gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorner, seemed to notice something new there, which induced him to\r\nglance at the opposite corner, and then to put on his glasses and stare\r\nat all the nooks and corners of the dim shop in succession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having the place cleaned up!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Mr Wegg. By the hand of adorable woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do next, I suppose, is to get married?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas took off his glasses again--finding himself too intensely\r\ndisgusted by the sprightly appearance of his friend and partner to bear\r\na magnified view of him and made the inquiry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the old party?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg!\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, with a sudden flush of wrath. \xe2\x80\x98The lady in\r\nquestion is not a old party.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I meant,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Wegg, testily, \xe2\x80\x98to the party as formerly objected?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98in a case of so much delicacy, I must trouble\r\nyou to say what you mean. There are strings that must not be played\r\nupon. No sir! Not sounded, unless in the most respectful and tuneful\r\nmanner. Of such melodious strings is Miss Pleasant Riderhood formed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it IS the lady as formerly objected?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus with dignity, \xe2\x80\x98I accept the altered phrase. It is\r\nthe lady as formerly objected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When is it to come off?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, with another flush. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot permit it to be\r\nput in the form of a Fight. I must temperately but firmly call upon you,\r\nsir, to amend that question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When is the lady,\xe2\x80\x99 Wegg reluctantly demanded, constraining his ill\r\ntemper in remembrance of the partnership and its stock in trade, \xe2\x80\x98a\r\ngoing to give her \xe2\x80\x98and where she has already given her \xe2\x80\x98art?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Venus, \xe2\x80\x98I again accept the altered phrase, and with\r\npleasure. The lady is a going to give her \xe2\x80\x98and where she has already\r\ngiven her \xe2\x80\x98art, next Monday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then the lady\xe2\x80\x99s objection has been met?\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98as I did name to you, I think, on a former\r\noccasion, if not on former occasions--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On former occasions,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Wegg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98--What,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Venus, \xe2\x80\x98what the nature of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s objection was, I\r\nmay impart, without violating any of the tender confidences since sprung\r\nup between the lady and myself, how it has been met, through the kind\r\ninterference of two good friends of mine: one, previously acquainted\r\nwith the lady: and one, not. The pint was thrown out, sir, by those two\r\nfriends when they did me the great service of waiting on the lady to\r\ntry if a union betwixt the lady and me could not be brought to bear--the\r\npint, I say, was thrown out by them, sir, whether if, after marriage,\r\nI confined myself to the articulation of men, children, and the lower\r\nanimals, it might not relieve the lady\xe2\x80\x99s mind of her feeling respecting\r\nbeing as a lady--regarded in a bony light. It was a happy thought, sir,\r\nand it took root.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would seem, Mr Venus,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Wegg, with a touch of distrust,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that you are flush of friends?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 that gentleman answered, in a tone of placid\r\nmystery. \xe2\x80\x98So-so, sir. Pretty well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, after eyeing him with another touch of distrust,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you joy. One man spends his fortune in one way, and another in\r\nanother. You are going to try matrimony. I mean to try travelling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, Mr Wegg?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Change of air, sea-scenery, and my natural rest, I hope may bring me\r\nround after the persecutions I have undergone from the dustman with his\r\nhead tied up, which I just now mentioned. The tough job being ended and\r\nthe Mounds laid low, the hour is come for Boffin to stump up. Would ten\r\nto-morrow morning suit you, partner, for finally bringing Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s nose\r\nto the grindstone?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTen to-morrow morning would quite suit Mr Venus for that excellent\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have had him well under inspection, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99 said Silas.\r\n\r\nMr Venus had had him under inspection pretty well every day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose you was just to step round to-night then, and give him orders\r\nfrom me--I say from me, because he knows I won\xe2\x80\x99t be played with--to be\r\nready with his papers, his accounts, and his cash, at that time in the\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98And as a matter of form, which will be agreeable\r\nto your own feelings, before we go out (for I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk with you part of\r\nthe way, though my leg gives under me with weariness), let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look\r\nat the stock in trade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Venus produced it, and it was perfectly correct; Mr Venus undertook\r\nto produce it again in the morning, and to keep tryst with Mr Wegg on\r\nBoffin\xe2\x80\x99s doorstep as the clock struck ten. At a certain point of the\r\nroad between Clerkenwell and Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s house (Mr Wegg expressly insisted\r\nthat there should be no prefix to the Golden Dustman\xe2\x80\x99s name) the\r\npartners separated for the night.\r\n\r\nIt was a very bad night; to which succeeded a very bad morning. The\r\nstreets were so unusually slushy, muddy, and miserable, in the morning,\r\nthat Wegg rode to the scene of action; arguing that a man who was, as\r\nit were, going to the Bank to draw out a handsome property, could well\r\nafford that trifling expense.\r\n\r\nVenus was punctual, and Wegg undertook to knock at the door, and conduct\r\nthe conference. Door knocked at. Door opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Boffin at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe servant replied that MR Boffin was at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98though it ain\xe2\x80\x99t what I call him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe servant inquired if they had any appointment?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I tell you what, young fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it. This\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want menials. I want Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were shown into a waiting-room, where the all-powerful Wegg wore\r\nhis hat, and whistled, and with his forefinger stirred up a clock that\r\nstood upon the chimneypiece, until he made it strike. In a few minutes\r\nthey were shown upstairs into what used to be Boffin\xe2\x80\x99s room; which,\r\nbesides the door of entrance, had folding-doors in it, to make it one\r\nof a suite of rooms when occasion required. Here, Boffin was seated at a\r\nlibrary-table, and here Mr Wegg, having imperiously motioned the servant\r\nto withdraw, drew up a chair and seated himself, in his hat, close\r\nbeside him. Here, also, Mr Wegg instantly underwent the remarkable\r\nexperience of having his hat twitched off his head and thrown out of a\r\nwindow, which was opened and shut for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be careful what insolent liberties you take in that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence,\xe2\x80\x99 said the owner of the hand which had done this, \xe2\x80\x98or I will\r\nthrow you after it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg involuntarily clapped his hand to his bare head, and stared at the\r\nSecretary. For, it was he addressed him with a severe countenance, and\r\nwho had come in quietly by the folding-doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, as soon as he recovered his suspended power of speech.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good! I gave directions for YOU to be dismissed. And you ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngone, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you? Oh! We\xe2\x80\x99ll look into this presently. Very good!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, nor I ain\xe2\x80\x99t gone,\xe2\x80\x99 said another voice.\r\n\r\nSomebody else had come in quietly by the folding-doors. Turning his\r\nhead, Wegg beheld his persecutor, the ever-wakeful dustman, accoutred\r\nwith fantail hat and velveteen smalls complete. Who, untying his\r\ntied-up broken head, revealed a head that was whole, and a face that was\r\nSloppy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, ha, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Sloppy in a peal of laughter, and with\r\nimmeasureable relish. \xe2\x80\x98He never thought as I could sleep standing, and\r\noften done it when I turned for Mrs Higden! He never thought as I used\r\nto give Mrs Higden the Police-news in different voices! But I did lead\r\nhim a life all through it, gentlemen, I hope I really and truly DID!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHere, Mr Sloppy opening his mouth to a quite alarming extent, and\r\nthrowing back his head to peal again, revealed incalculable buttons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, slightly discomfited, but not much as yet: \xe2\x80\x98one and one\r\nis two not dismissed, is it? Bof--fin! Just let me ask a question. Who\r\nset this chap on, in this dress, when the carting began? Who employed\r\nthis fellow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say!\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Sloppy, jerking his head forward. \xe2\x80\x98No fellows, or\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll throw you out of winder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Boffin appeased him with a wave of his hand, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I employed\r\nhim, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! You employed him, Boffin? Very good. Mr Venus, we raise our terms,\r\nand we can\xe2\x80\x99t do better than proceed to business. Bof--fin! I want the\r\nroom cleared of these two scum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be done, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Mr Boffin, sitting\r\ncomposedly on the library-table, at one end, while the Secretary sat\r\ncomposedly on it at the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bof--fin! Not going to be done?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Not at your peril?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, shaking his head good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x98Not at my\r\nperil, and not on any other terms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWegg reflected a moment, and then said: \xe2\x80\x98Mr Venus, will you be so good\r\nas hand me over that same dockyment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Venus, handing it to him with much politeness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There it is. Having now, sir, parted with it, I wish to make a small\r\nobservation: not so much because it is anyways necessary, or expresses\r\nany new doctrine or discovery, as because it is a comfort to my mind.\r\nSilas Wegg, you are a precious old rascal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Wegg, who, as if anticipating a compliment, had been beating\r\ntime with the paper to the other\xe2\x80\x99s politeness until this unexpected\r\nconclusion came upon him, stopped rather abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silas Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98know that I took the liberty of taking Mr\r\nBoffin into our concern as a sleeping partner, at a very early period of\r\nour firm\xe2\x80\x99s existence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite true,\xe2\x80\x99 added Mr Boffin; \xe2\x80\x98and I tested Venus by making him a\r\npretended proposal or two; and I found him on the whole a very honest\r\nman, Wegg.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So Mr Boffin, in his indulgence, is pleased to say,\xe2\x80\x99 Venus remarked:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98though in the beginning of this dirt, my hands were not, for a few\r\nhours, quite as clean as I could wish. But I hope I made early and full\r\namends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Venus, you did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Certainly, certainly, certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVenus inclined his head with respect and gratitude. \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir.\r\nI am much obliged to you, sir, for all. For your good opinion now, for\r\nyour way of receiving and encouraging me when I first put myself in\r\ncommunication with you, and for the influence since so kindly brought\r\nto bear upon a certain lady, both by yourself and by Mr John Harmon.\xe2\x80\x99 To\r\nwhom, when thus making mention of him, he also bowed.\r\n\r\nWegg followed the name with sharp ears, and the action with sharp eyes,\r\nand a certain cringing air was infusing itself into his bullying air,\r\nwhen his attention was re-claimed by Venus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything else between you and me, Mr Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Venus, \xe2\x80\x98now explains\r\nitself, and you can now make out, sir, without further words from me.\r\nBut totally to prevent any unpleasantness or mistake that might arise on\r\nwhat I consider an important point, to be made quite clear at the close\r\nof our acquaintance, I beg the leave of Mr Boffin and Mr John Harmon to\r\nrepeat an observation which I have already had the pleasure of bringing\r\nunder your notice. You are a precious old rascal!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a fool,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, with a snap of his fingers, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\ngot rid of you before now, if I could have struck out any way of doing\r\nit. I have thought it over, I can tell you. You may go, and welcome. You\r\nleave the more for me. Because, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg, dividing his next\r\nobservation between Mr Boffin and Mr Harmon, \xe2\x80\x98I am worth my price, and\r\nI mean to have it. This getting off is all very well in its way, and it\r\ntells with such an anatomical Pump as this one,\xe2\x80\x99 pointing out Mr Venus,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but it won\xe2\x80\x99t do with a Man. I am here to be bought off, and I have\r\nnamed my figure. Now, buy me, or leave me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98as far as I am\r\nconcerned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bof--fin!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Wegg, turning upon him with a severe air, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nunderstand YOUR new-born boldness. I see the brass underneath YOUR\r\nsilver plating. YOU have got YOUR nose out of joint. Knowing that you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnothing at stake, you can afford to come the independent game. Why,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re just so much smeary glass to see through, you know! But Mr Harmon\r\nis in another sitiwation. What Mr Harmon risks, is quite another pair\r\nof shoes. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd something lately about this being Mr\r\nHarmon--I make out now, some hints that I\xe2\x80\x99ve met on that subject in\r\nthe newspaper--and I drop you, Bof--fin, as beneath my notice. I ask Mr\r\nHarmon whether he has any idea of the contents of this present paper?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a will of my late father\xe2\x80\x99s, of more recent date than the will\r\nproved by Mr Boffin (address whom again, as you have addressed him\r\nalready, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock you down), leaving the whole of his property\r\nto the Crown,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Harmon, with as much indifference as was\r\ncompatible with extreme sternness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bight you are!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Wegg. \xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 screwing the weight of his body\r\nupon his wooden leg, and screwing his wooden head very much on one side,\r\nand screwing up one eye: \xe2\x80\x98then, I put the question to you, what\xe2\x80\x99s this\r\npaper worth?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Harmon.\r\n\r\nWegg had repeated the word with a sneer, and was entering on some\r\nsarcastic retort, when, to his boundless amazement, he found himself\r\ngripped by the cravat; shaken until his teeth chattered; shoved back,\r\nstaggering, into a corner of the room; and pinned there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x99 said John Harmon, whose seafaring hold was like that of\r\na vice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re knocking my head against the wall,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Silas faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean to knock your head against the wall,\xe2\x80\x99 returned John Harmon,\r\nsuiting his action to his words, with the heartiest good will; \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive a thousand pounds for leave to knock your brains out. Listen, you\r\nscoundrel, and look at that Dutch bottle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSloppy held it up, for his edification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That Dutch bottle, scoundrel, contained the latest will of the many\r\nwills made by my unhappy self-tormenting father. That will gives\r\neverything absolutely to my noble benefactor and yours, Mr Boffin,\r\nexcluding and reviling me, and my sister (then already dead of a broken\r\nheart), by name. That Dutch bottle was found by my noble benefactor and\r\nyours, after he entered on possession of the estate. That Dutch bottle\r\ndistressed him beyond measure, because, though I and my sister were\r\nboth no more, it cast a slur upon our memory which he knew we had\r\ndone nothing in our miserable youth, to deserve. That Dutch bottle,\r\ntherefore, he buried in the Mound belonging to him, and there it lay\r\nwhile you, you thankless wretch, were prodding and poking--often very\r\nnear it, I dare say. His intention was, that it should never see the\r\nlight; but he was afraid to destroy it, lest to destroy such a document,\r\neven with his great generous motive, might be an offence at law. After\r\nthe discovery was made here who I was, Mr Boffin, still restless on the\r\nsubject, told me, upon certain conditions impossible for such a hound as\r\nyou to appreciate, the secret of that Dutch bottle. I urged upon him the\r\nnecessity of its being dug up, and the paper being legally produced and\r\nestablished. The first thing you saw him do, and the second thing has\r\nbeen done without your knowledge. Consequently, the paper now rattling\r\nin your hand as I shake you--and I should like to shake the life out\r\nof you--is worth less than the rotten cork of the Dutch bottle, do you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJudging from the fallen countenance of Silas as his head wagged\r\nbackwards and forwards in a most uncomfortable manner, he did\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Harmon, taking another sailor-like turn on\r\nhis cravat and holding him in his corner at arms\xe2\x80\x99 length, \xe2\x80\x98I shall make\r\ntwo more short speeches to you, because I hope they will torment you.\r\nYour discovery was a genuine discovery (such as it was), for nobody had\r\nthought of looking into that place. Neither did we know you had made it,\r\nuntil Venus spoke to Mr Boffin, though I kept you under good observation\r\nfrom my first appearance here, and though Sloppy has long made it\r\nthe chief occupation and delight of his life, to attend you like your\r\nshadow. I tell you this, that you may know we knew enough of you to\r\npersuade Mr Boffin to let us lead you on, deluded, to the last possible\r\nmoment, in order that your disappointment might be the heaviest possible\r\ndisappointment. That\xe2\x80\x99s the first short speech, do you understand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, John Harmon assisted his comprehension with another shake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, scoundrel,\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued, \xe2\x80\x98I am going to finish. You supposed me\r\njust now, to be the possessor of my father\xe2\x80\x99s property.--So I am. But\r\nthrough any act of my father\xe2\x80\x99s, or by any right I have? No. Through the\r\nmunificence of Mr Boffin. The conditions that he made with me, before\r\nparting with the secret of the Dutch bottle, were, that I should take\r\nthe fortune, and that he should take his Mound and no more. I owe\r\neverything I possess, solely to the disinterestedness, uprightness,\r\ntenderness, goodness (there are no words to satisfy me) of Mr and Mrs\r\nBoffin. And when, knowing what I knew, I saw such a mud-worm as you\r\npresume to rise in this house against this noble soul, the wonder is,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadded John Harmon through his clenched teeth, and with a very ugly turn\r\nindeed on Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s cravat, \xe2\x80\x98that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to twist your head off,\r\nand fling THAT out of window! So. That\xe2\x80\x99s the last short speech, do you\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSilas, released, put his hand to his throat, cleared it, and looked as\r\nif he had a rather large fishbone in that region. Simultaneously with\r\nthis action on his part in his corner, a singular, and on the surface\r\nan incomprehensible, movement was made by Mr Sloppy: who began backing\r\ntowards Mr Wegg along the wall, in the manner of a porter or heaver who\r\nis about to lift a sack of flour or coals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry, Wegg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin, in his clemency, \xe2\x80\x98that my old lady\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t have a better opinion of you than the bad one we are forced\r\nto entertain. But I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to leave you, after all said and\r\ndone, worse off in life than I found you. Therefore say in a word,\r\nbefore we part, what it\xe2\x80\x99ll cost to set you up in another stall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And in another place,\xe2\x80\x99 John Harmon struck in. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t come outside\r\nthese windows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Wegg in avaricious humiliation: \xe2\x80\x98when I first had\r\nthe honour of making your acquaintance, I had got together a collection\r\nof ballads which was, I may say, above price.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then they can\xe2\x80\x99t be paid for,\xe2\x80\x99 said John Harmon, \xe2\x80\x98and you had better not\r\ntry, my dear sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, Mr Boffin,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Wegg, with a malignant glance in the\r\nlast speaker\xe2\x80\x99s direction, \xe2\x80\x98I was putting the case to you, who, if my\r\nsenses did not deceive me, put the case to me. I had a very choice\r\ncollection of ballads, and there was a new stock of gingerbread in the\r\ntin box. I say no more, but would rather leave it to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to name what\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin uneasily, with\r\nhis hand in his pocket, \xe2\x80\x98and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go beyond what\xe2\x80\x99s right,\r\nbecause you really have turned out such a very bad fellow. So artful,\r\nand so ungrateful you have been, Wegg; for when did I ever injure you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was also,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Wegg went on, in a meditative manner, \xe2\x80\x98a errand\r\nconnection, in which I was much respected. But I would not wish to be\r\ndeemed covetous, and I would rather leave it to you, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to put it at,\xe2\x80\x99 the Golden Dustman\r\nmuttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was likewise,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Wegg, \xe2\x80\x98a pair of trestles, for which alone\r\na Irish person, who was deemed a judge of trestles, offered five and\r\nsix--a sum I would not hear of, for I should have lost by it--and there\r\nwas a stool, a umbrella, a clothes-horse, and a tray. But I leave it to\r\nyou, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Golden Dustman seeming to be engaged in some abstruse calculation,\r\nMr Wegg assisted him with the following additional items.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was, further, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle\r\nParker. Ah! When a man thinks of the loss of such patronage as that;\r\nwhen a man finds so fair a garden rooted up by pigs; he finds it hard\r\nindeed, without going high, to work it into money. But I leave it wholly\r\nto you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sloppy still continued his singular, and on the surface his\r\nincomprehensible, movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leading on has been mentioned,\xe2\x80\x99 said Wegg with a melancholy air, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to say how far the tone of my mind may have been lowered\r\nby unwholesome reading on the subject of Misers, when you was leading me\r\nand others on to think you one yourself, sir. All I can say is, that\r\nI felt my tone of mind a lowering at the time. And how can a man put a\r\nprice upon his mind! There was likewise a hat just now. But I leave the\r\nole to you, Mr Boffin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Boffin. \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of pound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In justice to myself, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words were but out of his mouth when John Harmon lifted his finger,\r\nand Sloppy, who was now close to Wegg, backed to Wegg\xe2\x80\x99s back, stooped,\r\ngrasped his coat collar behind with both hands, and deftly swung him\r\nup like the sack of flour or coals before mentioned. A countenance of\r\nspecial discontent and amazement Mr Wegg exhibited in this position,\r\nwith his buttons almost as prominently on view as Sloppy\xe2\x80\x99s own, and\r\nwith his wooden leg in a highly unaccommodating state. But, not for many\r\nseconds was his countenance visible in the room; for, Sloppy lightly\r\ntrotted out with him and trotted down the staircase, Mr Venus attending\r\nto open the street door. Mr Sloppy\xe2\x80\x99s instructions had been to deposit\r\nhis burden in the road; but, a scavenger\xe2\x80\x99s cart happening to stand\r\nunattended at the corner, with its little ladder planted against the\r\nwheel, Mr S. found it impossible to resist the temptation of shooting Mr\r\nSilas Wegg into the cart\xe2\x80\x99s contents. A somewhat difficult feat, achieved\r\nwith great dexterity, and with a prodigious splash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\nWHAT WAS CAUGHT IN THE TRAPS THAT WERE SET\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Bradley Headstone had been racked and riven in his mind since the\r\nquiet evening when by the river-side he had risen, as it were, out of\r\nthe ashes of the Bargeman, none but he could have told. Not even he\r\ncould have told, for such misery can only be felt.\r\n\r\nFirst, he had to bear the combined weight of the knowledge of what he\r\nhad done, of that haunting reproach that he might have done it so much\r\nbetter, and of the dread of discovery. This was load enough to crush\r\nhim, and he laboured under it day and night. It was as heavy on him in\r\nhis scanty sleep, as in his red-eyed waking hours. It bore him down with\r\na dread unchanging monotony, in which there was not a moment\xe2\x80\x99s variety.\r\nThe overweighted beast of burden, or the overweighted slave, can for\r\ncertain instants shift the physical load, and find some slight respite\r\neven in enforcing additional pain upon such a set of muscles or such\r\na limb. Not even that poor mockery of relief could the wretched man\r\nobtain, under the steady pressure of the infernal atmosphere into which\r\nhe had entered.\r\n\r\nTime went by, and no visible suspicion dogged him; time went by, and\r\nin such public accounts of the attack as were renewed at intervals,\r\nhe began to see Mr Lightwood (who acted as lawyer for the injured man)\r\nstraying further from the fact, going wider of the issue, and evidently\r\nslackening in his zeal. By degrees, a glimmering of the cause of this\r\nbegan to break on Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s sight. Then came the chance meeting with Mr\r\nMilvey at the railway station (where he often lingered in his leisure\r\nhours, as a place where any fresh news of his deed would be circulated,\r\nor any placard referring to it would be posted), and then he saw in the\r\nlight what he had brought about.\r\n\r\nFor, then he saw that through his desperate attempt to separate those\r\ntwo for ever, he had been made the means of uniting them. That he had\r\ndipped his hands in blood, to mark himself a miserable fool and tool.\r\nThat Eugene Wrayburn, for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s sake, set him aside and left him to\r\ncrawl along his blasted course. He thought of Fate, or Providence, or\r\nbe the directing Power what it might, as having put a fraud upon\r\nhim--overreached him--and in his impotent mad rage bit, and tore, and\r\nhad his fit.\r\n\r\nNew assurance of the truth came upon him in the next few following days,\r\nwhen it was put forth how the wounded man had been married on his bed,\r\nand to whom, and how, though always in a dangerous condition, he was a\r\nshade better. Bradley would far rather have been seized for his murder,\r\nthan he would have read that passage, knowing himself spared, and\r\nknowing why.\r\n\r\nBut, not to be still further defrauded and overreached--which he would\r\nbe, if implicated by Riderhood, and punished by the law for his abject\r\nfailure, as though it had been a success--he kept close in his school\r\nduring the day, ventured out warily at night, and went no more to the\r\nrailway station. He examined the advertisements in the newspapers for\r\nany sign that Riderhood acted on his hinted threat of so summoning him\r\nto renew their acquaintance, but found none. Having paid him handsomely\r\nfor the support and accommodation he had had at the Lock House, and\r\nknowing him to be a very ignorant man who could not write, he began to\r\ndoubt whether he was to be feared at all, or whether they need ever meet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAll this time, his mind was never off the rack, and his raging sense of\r\nhaving been made to fling himself across the chasm which divided those\r\ntwo, and bridge it over for their coming together, never cooled down.\r\nThis horrible condition brought on other fits. He could not have said\r\nhow many, or when; but he saw in the faces of his pupils that they had\r\nseen him in that state, and that they were possessed by a dread of his\r\nrelapsing.\r\n\r\nOne winter day when a slight fall of snow was feathering the sills and\r\nframes of the schoolroom windows, he stood at his black board, crayon in\r\nhand, about to commence with a class; when, reading in the countenances\r\nof those boys that there was something wrong, and that they seemed in\r\nalarm for him, he turned his eyes to the door towards which they faced.\r\nHe then saw a slouching man of forbidding appearance standing in the\r\nmidst of the school, with a bundle under his arm; and saw that it was\r\nRiderhood.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a stool which one of his boys put for him, and he had a\r\npassing knowledge that he was in danger of falling, and that his face\r\nwas becoming distorted. But, the fit went off for that time, and he\r\nwiped his mouth, and stood up again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, governor! By your leave!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, knuckling\r\nhis forehead, with a chuckle and a leer. \xe2\x80\x98What place may this be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where young folks learns wot\xe2\x80\x99s right?\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, gravely nodding.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beg your pardon, governor! By your leave! But who teaches this school?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re the master, are you, learned governor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I am the master.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a lovely thing it must be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98fur to learn young\r\nfolks wot\xe2\x80\x99s right, and fur to know wot THEY know wot you do it. Beg your\r\npardon, learned governor! By your leave!--That there black board; wot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nit for?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is for drawing on, or writing on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it though!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought it, from the\r\nlooks on it! WOULD you be so kind as write your name upon it, learned\r\ngovernor?\xe2\x80\x99 (In a wheedling tone.)\r\n\r\nBradley hesitated for a moment; but placed his usual signature,\r\nenlarged, upon the board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a learned character myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, surveying the\r\nclass, \xe2\x80\x98but I do admire learning in others. I should dearly like to hear\r\nthese here young folks read that there name off, from the writing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe arms of the class went up. At the miserable master\xe2\x80\x99s nod, the shrill\r\nchorus arose: \xe2\x80\x98Bradley Headstone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it? Headstone! Why, that\xe2\x80\x99s in a\r\nchurchyard. Hooroar for another turn!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother tossing of arms, another nod, and another shrill chorus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bradley Headstone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, after attentively listening, and\r\ninternally repeating: \xe2\x80\x98Bradley. I see. Chris\xe2\x80\x99en name, Bradley sim\xe2\x80\x99lar to\r\nRoger which is my own. Eh? Fam\xe2\x80\x99ly name, Headstone, sim\xe2\x80\x99lar to Riderhood\r\nwhich is my own. Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShrill chorus. \xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Might you be acquainted, learned governor,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98with a\r\nperson of about your own heighth and breadth, and wot \xe2\x80\x98ud pull down in\r\na scale about your own weight, answering to a name sounding summat like\r\nTotherest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a desperation in him that made him perfectly quiet, though his jaw\r\nwas heavily squared; with his eyes upon Riderhood; and with traces of\r\nquickened breathing in his nostrils; the schoolmaster replied, in a\r\nsuppressed voice, after a pause: \xe2\x80\x98I think I know the man you mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you knowed the man I mean, learned governor. I want the man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith a half glance around him at his pupils, Bradley returned:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you suppose he is here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Begging your pardon, learned governor, and by your leave,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRiderhood, with a laugh, \xe2\x80\x98how could I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s here, when there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnobody here but you, and me, and these young lambs wot you\xe2\x80\x99re a learning\r\non? But he is most excellent company, that man, and I want him to come\r\nand see me at my Lock, up the river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98D\xe2\x80\x99ye think he\xe2\x80\x99ll come?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Riderhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure he will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Having got your word for him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98I shall count upon him.\r\nP\xe2\x80\x99raps you\xe2\x80\x99d so fur obleege me, learned governor, as tell him that if he\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t come precious soon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look him up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He shall know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thankee. As I says a while ago,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Riderhood, changing his hoarse\r\ntone and leering round upon the class again, \xe2\x80\x98though not a learned\r\ncharacter my own self, I do admire learning in others, to be sure! Being\r\nhere and having met with your kind attention, Master, might I, afore I\r\ngo, ask a question of these here young lambs of yourn?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it is in the way of school,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, always sustaining his\r\ndark look at the other, and speaking in his suppressed voice, \xe2\x80\x98you may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! It\xe2\x80\x99s in the way of school!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll pound it,\r\nMaster, to be in the way of school. Wot\xe2\x80\x99s the diwisions of water, my\r\nlambs? Wot sorts of water is there on the land?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShrill chorus: \xe2\x80\x98Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the\r\nlot, Master! Blowed if I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have left out lakes, never having\r\nclapped eyes upon one, to my knowledge. Seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds.\r\nWot is it, lambs, as they ketches in seas, rivers, lakes, and ponds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShrill chorus (with some contempt for the ease of the question):\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fish!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good a-gin!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98But wot else is it, my lambs, as they\r\nsometimes ketches in rivers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nChorus at a loss. One shrill voice: \xe2\x80\x98Weed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good agin!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98But it ain\xe2\x80\x99t weed neither. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nguess, my dears. Wot is it, besides fish, as they sometimes ketches in\r\nrivers? Well! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. It\xe2\x80\x99s suits o\xe2\x80\x99 clothes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley\xe2\x80\x99s face changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leastways, lambs,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, observing him out of the corners\r\nof his eyes, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s wot I my own self sometimes ketches in rivers. For\r\nstrike me blind, my lambs, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ketch in a river the wery bundle\r\nunder my arm!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe class looked at the master, as if appealing from the irregular\r\nentrapment of this mode of examination. The master looked at the\r\nexaminer, as if he would have torn him to pieces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ask your pardon, learned governor,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, smearing his\r\nsleeve across his mouth as he laughed with a relish, \xe2\x80\x98tain\xe2\x80\x99t fair to the\r\nlambs, I know. It wos a bit of fun of mine. But upon my soul I drawed\r\nthis here bundle out of a river! It\xe2\x80\x99s a Bargeman\xe2\x80\x99s suit of clothes. You\r\nsee, it had been sunk there by the man as wore it, and I got it up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you know it was sunk by the man who wore it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bradley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cause I see him do it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other. Bradley, slowly withdrawing his eyes, turned\r\nhis face to the black board and slowly wiped his name out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A heap of thanks, Master,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98for bestowing so much of\r\nyour time, and of the lambses\xe2\x80\x99 time, upon a man as hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got no other\r\nrecommendation to you than being a honest man. Wishing to see at my Lock\r\nup the river, the person as we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoke of, and as you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered for,\r\nI takes my leave of the lambs and of their learned governor both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith those words, he slouched out of the school, leaving the master\r\nto get through his weary work as he might, and leaving the whispering\r\npupils to observe the master\xe2\x80\x99s face until he fell into the fit which had\r\nbeen long impending.\r\n\r\nThe next day but one was Saturday, and a holiday. Bradley rose early,\r\nand set out on foot for Plashwater Weir Mill Lock. He rose so early that\r\nit was not yet light when he began his journey. Before extinguishing the\r\ncandle by which he had dressed himself, he made a little parcel of his\r\ndecent silver watch and its decent guard, and wrote inside the paper:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kindly take care of these for me.\xe2\x80\x99 He then addressed the parcel to Miss\r\nPeecher, and left it on the most protected corner of the little seat in\r\nher little porch.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold hard easterly morning when he latched the garden gate\r\nand turned away. The light snowfall which had feathered his schoolroom\r\nwindows on the Thursday, still lingered in the air, and was falling\r\nwhite, while the wind blew black. The tardy day did not appear until he\r\nhad been on foot two hours, and had traversed a greater part of London\r\nfrom east to west. Such breakfast as he had, he took at the comfortless\r\npublic-house where he had parted from Riderhood on the occasion of\r\ntheir night-walk. He took it, standing at the littered bar, and looked\r\nloweringly at a man who stood where Riderhood had stood that early\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHe outwalked the short day, and was on the towing-path by the river,\r\nsomewhat footsore, when the night closed in. Still two or three miles\r\nshort of the Lock, he slackened his pace then, but went steadily on. The\r\nground was now covered with snow, though thinly, and there were floating\r\nlumps of ice in the more exposed parts of the river, and broken sheets\r\nof ice under the shelter of the banks. He took heed of nothing but the\r\nice, the snow, and the distance, until he saw a light ahead, which he\r\nknew gleamed from the Lock House window. It arrested his steps, and he\r\nlooked all around. The ice, and the snow, and he, and the one light, had\r\nabsolute possession of the dreary scene. In the distance before him, lay\r\nthe place where he had struck the worse than useless blows that mocked\r\nhim with Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s presence there as Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s wife. In the distance\r\nbehind him, lay the place where the children with pointing arms had\r\nseemed to devote him to the demons in crying out his name. Within there,\r\nwhere the light was, was the man who as to both distances could give him\r\nup to ruin. To these limits had his world shrunk.\r\n\r\nHe mended his pace, keeping his eyes upon the light with a strange\r\nintensity, as if he were taking aim at it. When he approached it so\r\nnearly as that it parted into rays, they seemed to fasten themselves\r\nto him and draw him on. When he struck the door with his hand, his foot\r\nfollowed so quickly on his hand, that he was in the room before he was\r\nbidden to enter.\r\n\r\nThe light was the joint product of a fire and a candle. Between the two,\r\nwith his feet on the iron fender, sat Riderhood, pipe in mouth.\r\n\r\nHe looked up with a surly nod when his visitor came in. His visitor\r\nlooked down with a surly nod. His outer clothing removed, the visitor\r\nthen took a seat on the opposite side of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a smoker, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, pushing a bottle to him across\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey both lapsed into silence, with their eyes upon the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be told I am here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley at length. \xe2\x80\x98Who is\r\nto begin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98when I\xe2\x80\x99ve smoked this here pipe out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe finished it with great deliberation, knocked out the ashes on the\r\nhob, and put it by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll begin,\xe2\x80\x99 he then repeated, \xe2\x80\x98Bradley Headstone, Master, if you wish\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wish it? I wish to know what you want with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so you shall.\xe2\x80\x99 Riderhood had looked hard at his hands and his\r\npockets, apparently as a precautionary measure lest he should have any\r\nweapon about him. But, he now leaned forward, turning the collar of\r\nhis waistcoat with an inquisitive finger, and asked, \xe2\x80\x98Why, where\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nwatch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have left it behind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want it. But it can be fetched. I\xe2\x80\x99ve took a fancy to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley answered with a contemptuous laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want it,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Riderhood, in a louder voice, \xe2\x80\x98and I mean to have\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is what you want of me, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, still louder; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y part of what I want of\r\nyou. I want money of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything else?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everythink else!\xe2\x80\x99 roared Riderhood, in a very loud and furious way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Answer me like that, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t so much as look at me like that, or I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you at all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvociferated Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98But, instead of talking, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring my hand\r\ndown upon you with all its weight,\xe2\x80\x99 heavily smiting the table with great\r\nforce, \xe2\x80\x98and smash you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bradley, after moistening his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O! I\xe2\x80\x99m a going on. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you fear but I\xe2\x80\x99ll go on full-fast enough for\r\nyou, and fur enough for you, without your telling. Look here, Bradley\r\nHeadstone, Master. You might have split the T\xe2\x80\x99other governor to chips\r\nand wedges, without my caring, except that I might have come upon you\r\nfor a glass or so now and then. Else why have to do with you at all? But\r\nwhen you copied my clothes, and when you copied my neckhankercher, and\r\nwhen you shook blood upon me after you had done the trick, you did wot\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid for and paid heavy for. If it come to be throw\xe2\x80\x99d upon you,\r\nyou was to be ready to throw it upon me, was you? Where else but\r\nin Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a man dressed according as\r\ndescribed? Where else but in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock was there a\r\nman as had had words with him coming through in his boat? Look at the\r\nLock-keeper in Plashwater Weir Mill Lock, in them same answering clothes\r\nand with that same answering red neckhankercher, and see whether his\r\nclothes happens to be bloody or not. Yes, they do happen to be bloody.\r\nAh, you sly devil!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley, very white, sat looking at him in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But two could play at your game,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, snapping his fingers\r\nat him half a dozen times, \xe2\x80\x98and I played it long ago; long afore you\r\ntried your clumsy hand at it; in days when you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t begun croaking\r\nyour lecters or what not in your school. I know to a figure how you\r\ndone it. Where you stole away, I could steal away arter you, and do it\r\nknowinger than you. I know how you come away from London in your own\r\nclothes, and where you changed your clothes, and hid your clothes. I see\r\nyou with my own eyes take your own clothes from their hiding-place\r\namong them felled trees, and take a dip in the river to account for\r\nyour dressing yourself, to any one as might come by. I see you rise up\r\nBradley Headstone, Master, where you sat down Bargeman. I see you pitch\r\nyour Bargeman\xe2\x80\x99s bundle into the river. I hooked your Bargeman\xe2\x80\x99s bundle\r\nout of the river. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got your Bargeman\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, tore this way and\r\nthat way with the scuffle, stained green with the grass, and spattered\r\nall over with what bust from the blows. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got them, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a curse for the T\xe2\x80\x99other governor, alive or dead, but I care\r\na many curses for my own self. And as you laid your plots agin me and\r\nwas a sly devil agin me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid for it--I\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid for it--I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe paid for it--till I\xe2\x80\x99ve drained you dry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley looked at the fire, with a working face, and was silent for a\r\nwhile. At last he said, with what seemed an inconsistent composure of\r\nvoice and feature:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t get blood out of a stone, Riderhood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can get money out of a schoolmaster though.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of me what is not in me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t wrest from me what\r\nI have not got. Mine is but a poor calling. You have had more than two\r\nguineas from me, already. Do you know how long it has taken me (allowing\r\nfor a long and arduous training) to earn such a sum?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, nor I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Yours is a \xe2\x80\x98spectable calling. To\r\nsave your \xe2\x80\x98spectability, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth your while to pawn every article of\r\nclothes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got, sell every stick in your house, and beg and borrow\r\nevery penny you can get trusted with. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve done that and handed\r\nover, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you. Not afore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ll leave me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean as I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you company, wherever you go, when you go away from\r\nhere. Let the Lock take care of itself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you, once I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley again looked at the fire. Eyeing him aside, Riderhood took up\r\nhis pipe, refilled it, lighted it, and sat smoking. Bradley leaned his\r\nelbows on his knees, and his head upon his hands, and looked at the fire\r\nwith a most intent abstraction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Riderhood,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, raising himself in his chair, after a long\r\nsilence, and drawing out his purse and putting it on the table. \xe2\x80\x98Say\r\nI part with this, which is all the money I have; say I let you have\r\nmy watch; say that every quarter, when I draw my salary, I pay you a\r\ncertain portion of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say nothink of the sort,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Riderhood, shaking his head as he\r\nsmoked. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve got away once, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t run the chance agin. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had\r\ntrouble enough to find you, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found you, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen you slipping along the street overnight, and watched you till you\r\nwas safe housed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have one settlement with you for good and all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Riderhood, I am a man who has lived a retired life. I have no resources\r\nbeyond myself. I have absolutely no friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a lie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve got one friend as I knows of;\r\none as is good for a Savings-Bank book, or I\xe2\x80\x99m a blue monkey!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened, and his hand slowly closed on the purse and\r\ndrew it back, as he sat listening for what the other should go on to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went into the wrong shop, fust, last Thursday,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Found myself among the young ladies, by George! Over the young ladies,\r\nI see a Missis. That Missis is sweet enough upon you, Master, to sell\r\nherself up, slap, to get you out of trouble. Make her do it then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley stared at him so very suddenly that Riderhood, not quite knowing\r\nhow to take it, affected to be occupied with the encircling smoke from\r\nhis pipe; fanning it away with his hand, and blowing it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You spoke to the mistress, did you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Bradley, with that\r\nformer composure of voice and feature that seemed inconsistent, and with\r\naverted eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poof! Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, withdrawing his attention from the smoke.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I spoke to her. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much to her. She was put in a fluster by\r\nmy dropping in among the young ladies (I never did set up for a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nman), and she took me into her parlour to hope as there was nothink\r\nwrong. I tells her, \xe2\x80\x9cO no, nothink wrong. The master\xe2\x80\x99s my wery good\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d But I see how the land laid, and that she was comfortable off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley put the purse in his pocket, grasped his left wrist with his\r\nright hand, and sat rigidly contemplating the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live more handy to you than she does,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and when I goes home with you (as of course I am a going), I recommend\r\nyou to clean her out without loss of time. You can marry her, arter you\r\nand me have come to a settlement. She\xe2\x80\x99s nice-looking, and I know\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t be keeping company with no one else, having been so lately\r\ndisapinted in another quarter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot one other word did Bradley utter all that night. Not once did he\r\nchange his attitude, or loosen his hold upon his wrist. Rigid before the\r\nfire, as if it were a charmed flame that was turning him old, he sat,\r\nwith the dark lines deepening in his face, its stare becoming more and\r\nmore haggard, its surface turning whiter and whiter as if it were being\r\noverspread with ashes, and the very texture and colour of his hair\r\ndegenerating.\r\n\r\nNot until the late daylight made the window transparent, did this\r\ndecaying statue move. Then it slowly arose, and sat in the window\r\nlooking out.\r\n\r\nRiderhood had kept his chair all night. In the earlier part of the night\r\nhe had muttered twice or thrice that it was bitter cold; or that the\r\nfire burnt fast, when he got up to mend it; but, as he could elicit from\r\nhis companion neither sound nor movement, he had afterwards held his\r\npeace. He was making some disorderly preparations for coffee, when\r\nBradley came from the window and put on his outer coat and hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t us better have a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast afore we start?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRiderhood. \xe2\x80\x98It ain\xe2\x80\x99t good to freeze a empty stomach, Master.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout a sign to show that he heard, Bradley walked out of the Lock\r\nHouse. Catching up from the table a piece of bread, and taking his\r\nBargeman\xe2\x80\x99s bundle under his arm, Riderhood immediately followed him.\r\nBradley turned towards London. Riderhood caught him up, and walked at\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nThe two men trudged on, side by side, in silence, full three miles.\r\nSuddenly, Bradley turned to retrace his course. Instantly, Riderhood\r\nturned likewise, and they went back side by side.\r\n\r\nBradley re-entered the Lock House. So did Riderhood. Bradley sat down in\r\nthe window. Riderhood warmed himself at the fire. After an hour or more,\r\nBradley abruptly got up again, and again went out, but this time turned\r\nthe other way. Riderhood was close after him, caught him up in a few\r\npaces, and walked at his side.\r\n\r\nThis time, as before, when he found his attendant not to be shaken off,\r\nBradley suddenly turned back. This time, as before, Riderhood turned\r\nback along with him. But, not this time, as before, did they go into the\r\nLock House, for Bradley came to a stand on the snow-covered turf by the\r\nLock, looking up the river and down the river. Navigation was impeded by\r\nthe frost, and the scene was a mere white and yellow desert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come, Master,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Riderhood, at his side. \xe2\x80\x98This is a dry game.\r\nAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s the good of it? You can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of me, except by coming to\r\na settlement. I am a going along with you wherever you go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout a word of reply, Bradley passed quickly from him over the wooden\r\nbridge on the lock gates. \xe2\x80\x98Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s even less sense in this move\r\nthan t\xe2\x80\x99other,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, following. \xe2\x80\x98The Weir\xe2\x80\x99s there, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave to come back, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout taking the least notice, Bradley leaned his body against a post,\r\nin a resting attitude, and there rested with his eyes cast down. \xe2\x80\x98Being\r\nbrought here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, gruffly, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it to some use by\r\nchanging my gates.\xe2\x80\x99 With a rattle and a rush of water, he then swung-to\r\nthe lock gates that were standing open, before opening the others. So,\r\nboth sets of gates were, for the moment, closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better by far be reasonable, Bradley Headstone, Master,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRiderhood, passing him, \xe2\x80\x98or I\xe2\x80\x99ll drain you all the dryer for it, when we\r\ndo settle.--Ah! Would you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley had caught him round the body. He seemed to be girdled with an\r\niron ring. They were on the brink of the Lock, about midway between the\r\ntwo sets of gates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let go!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood, \xe2\x80\x98or I\xe2\x80\x99ll get my knife out and slash you\r\nwherever I can cut you. Let go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBradley was drawing to the Lock-edge. Riderhood was drawing away from\r\nit. It was a strong grapple, and a fierce struggle, arm and leg. Bradley\r\ngot him round, with his back to the Lock, and still worked him backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let go!\xe2\x80\x99 said Riderhood. \xe2\x80\x98Stop! What are you trying at? You can\xe2\x80\x99t drown\r\nMe. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t I told you that the man as has come through drowning can never\r\nbe drowned? I can\xe2\x80\x99t be drowned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can be!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Bradley, in a desperate, clenched voice. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nresolved to be. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you living, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold you dead. Come\r\ndown!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRiderhood went over into the smooth pit, backward, and Bradley Headstone\r\nupon him. When the two were found, lying under the ooze and scum behind\r\none of the rotting gates, Riderhood\xe2\x80\x99s hold had relaxed, probably in\r\nfalling, and his eyes were staring upward. But, he was girdled still\r\nwith Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s iron ring, and the rivets of the iron ring held tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 16\r\n\r\nPERSONS AND THINGS IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s first delightful occupation was, to set all\r\nmatters right that had strayed in any way wrong, or that might, could,\r\nwould, or should, have strayed in any way wrong, while their name was in\r\nabeyance. In tracing out affairs for which John\xe2\x80\x99s fictitious death was\r\nto be considered in any way responsible, they used a very broad and free\r\nconstruction; regarding, for instance, the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker as having\r\na claim on their protection, because of her association with Mrs Eugene\r\nWrayburn, and because of Mrs Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s old association, in her turn, with\r\nthe dark side of the story. It followed that the old man, Riah, as a\r\ngood and serviceable friend to both, was not to be disclaimed. Nor even\r\nMr Inspector, as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a\r\nfalse scent. It may be remarked, in connexion with that worthy officer,\r\nthat a rumour shortly afterwards pervaded the Force, to the effect that\r\nhe had confided to Miss Abbey Potterson, over a jug of mellow flip in\r\nthe bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, that he \xe2\x80\x98didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand to\r\nlose a farthing\xe2\x80\x99 through Mr Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s coming to life, but was quite as\r\nwell satisfied as if that gentleman had been barbarously murdered, and\r\nhe (Mr Inspector) had pocketed the government reward.\r\n\r\nIn all their arrangements of such nature, Mr and Mrs John Harmon derived\r\nmuch assistance from their eminent solicitor, Mr Mortimer Lightwood; who\r\nlaid about him professionally with such unwonted despatch and intention,\r\nthat a piece of work was vigorously pursued as soon as cut out; whereby\r\nYoung Blight was acted on as by that transatlantic dram which is\r\npoetically named An Eye-Opener, and found himself staring at real\r\nclients instead of out of window. The accessibility of Riah proving\r\nvery useful as to a few hints towards the disentanglement of Eugene\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naffairs, Lightwood applied himself with infinite zest to attacking and\r\nharassing Mr Fledgeby: who, discovering himself in danger of being blown\r\ninto the air by certain explosive transactions in which he had been\r\nengaged, and having been sufficiently flayed under his beating, came\r\nto a parley and asked for quarter. The harmless Twemlow profited by\r\nthe conditions entered into, though he little thought it. Mr Riah\r\nunaccountably melted; waited in person on him over the stable yard in\r\nDuke Street, St James\xe2\x80\x99s, no longer ravening but mild, to inform him\r\nthat payment of interest as heretofore, but henceforth at Mr Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffices, would appease his Jewish rancour; and departed with the secret\r\nthat Mr John Harmon had advanced the money and become the creditor.\r\nThus, was the sublime Snigsworth\xe2\x80\x99s wrath averted, and thus did he snort\r\nno larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the\r\nprint over the fireplace, than was normally in his (and the British)\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Wilfer\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to the Mendicant\xe2\x80\x99s bride at the new abode of\r\nMendicancy, was a grand event. Pa had been sent for into the City,\r\non the very day of taking possession, and had been stunned with\r\nastonishment, and brought-to, and led about the house by one ear, to\r\nbehold its various treasures, and had been enraptured and enchanted. Pa\r\nhad also been appointed Secretary, and had been enjoined to give instant\r\nnotice of resignation to Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles, for ever and\r\never. But Ma came later, and came, as was her due, in state.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was sent for Ma, who entered it with a bearing worthy of\r\nthe occasion, accompanied, rather than supported, by Miss Lavinia, who\r\naltogether declined to recognize the maternal majesty. Mr George Sampson\r\nmeekly followed. He was received in the vehicle, by Mrs Wilfer, as if\r\nadmitted to the honour of assisting at a funeral in the family, and she\r\nthen issued the order, \xe2\x80\x98Onward!\xe2\x80\x99 to the Mendicant\xe2\x80\x99s menial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish to goodness, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy, throwing herself back among the\r\ncushions, with her arms crossed, \xe2\x80\x98that you\xe2\x80\x99d loll a little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mrs Wilfer. \xe2\x80\x98Loll!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Ma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said the impressive lady, \xe2\x80\x98I am incapable of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure you look so, Ma. But why one should go out to dine with one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown daughter or sister, as if one\xe2\x80\x99s under-petticoat was a backboard, I\r\ndo NOT understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither do I understand,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Mrs Wilfer, with deep scorn, \xe2\x80\x98how\r\na young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have\r\nindulged. I blush for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lavvy, yawning, \xe2\x80\x98but I can do it for myself, I am\r\nobliged to you, when there\xe2\x80\x99s any occasion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere, Mr Sampson, with the view of establishing harmony, which he never\r\nunder any circumstances succeeded in doing, said with an agreeable\r\nsmile: \xe2\x80\x98After all, you know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, we know it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x99 And immediately\r\nfelt that he had committed himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We know it\xe2\x80\x99s there!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, glaring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, George,\xe2\x80\x99 remonstrated Miss Lavinia, \xe2\x80\x98I must say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand your allusions, and that I think you might be more delicate\r\nand less personal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Sampson, becoming, on the shortest notice, a prey to\r\ndespair. \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes! Go it, Miss Lavinia Wilfer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What you may mean, George Sampson, by your omnibus-driving expressions,\r\nI cannot pretend to imagine. Neither,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Lavinia, \xe2\x80\x98Mr George\r\nSampson, do I wish to imagine. It is enough for me to know in my own\r\nheart that I am not going to--\xe2\x80\x99 having imprudently got into a sentence\r\nwithout providing a way out of it, Miss Lavinia was constrained to\r\nclose with \xe2\x80\x98going to it\xe2\x80\x99. A weak conclusion which, however, derived some\r\nappearance of strength from disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr Sampson, with bitterness. \xe2\x80\x98Thus it ever is. I\r\nnever--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Lavvy cut him short, that you never brought\r\nup a young gazelle, you may save yourself the trouble, because nobody\r\nin this carriage supposes that you ever did. We know you better.\xe2\x80\x99 (As if\r\nthis were a home-thrust.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr Sampson, in a dismal vein, \xe2\x80\x98I did not mean to\r\nsay so. What I did mean to say, was, that I never expected to retain my\r\nfavoured place in this family, after Fortune shed her beams upon it. Why\r\ndo you take me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr Sampson, \xe2\x80\x98to the glittering halls with which\r\nI can never compete, and then taunt me with my moderate salary? Is it\r\ngenerous? Is it kind?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe stately lady, Mrs Wilfer, perceiving her opportunity of delivering a\r\nfew remarks from the throne, here took up the altercation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Sampson,\xe2\x80\x99 she began, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot permit you to misrepresent the\r\nintentions of a child of mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let him alone, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Lavvy interposed with haughtiness. \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nindifferent to me what he says or does.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Mrs Wilfer, \xe2\x80\x98this touches the blood of the family.\r\nIf Mr George Sampson attributes, even to my youngest daughter--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should use the word \xe2\x80\x9ceven\xe2\x80\x9d, Ma,\xe2\x80\x99 Miss Lavvy\r\ninterposed, \xe2\x80\x98because I am quite as important as any of the others.\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peace!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Wilfer, solemnly. \xe2\x80\x98I repeat, if Mr George Sampson\r\nattributes, to my youngest daughter, grovelling motives, he attributes\r\nthem equally to the mother of my youngest daughter. That mother\r\nrepudiates them, and demands of Mr George Sampson, as a youth of honour,\r\nwhat he WOULD have? I may be mistaken--nothing is more likely--but Mr\r\nGeorge Sampson,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Mrs Wilfer, majestically waving her gloves,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98appears to me to be seated in a first-class equipage. Mr George Sampson\r\nappears to me to be on his way, by his own admission, to a residence\r\nthat may be termed Palatial. Mr George Sampson appears to me to be\r\ninvited to participate in the--shall I say the--Elevation which has\r\ndescended on the family with which he is ambitious, shall I say to\r\nMingle? Whence, then, this tone on Mr Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s part?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is only, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sampson explained, in exceedingly low spirits,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because, in a pecuniary sense, I am painfully conscious of my\r\nunworthiness. Lavinia is now highly connected. Can I hope that she will\r\nstill remain the same Lavinia as of old? And is it not pardonable if\r\nI feel sensitive, when I see a disposition on her part to take me up\r\nshort?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are not satisfied with your position, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Miss\r\nLavinia, with much politeness, \xe2\x80\x98we can set you down at any turning you\r\nmay please to indicate to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s coachman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Lavinia,\xe2\x80\x99 urged Mr Sampson, pathetically, \xe2\x80\x98I adore you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then if you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a more agreeable manner,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the young\r\nlady, \xe2\x80\x98I wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I also,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Mr Sampson, \xe2\x80\x98respect you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, to an extent which\r\nmust ever be below your merits, I am well aware, but still up to an\r\nuncommon mark. Bear with a wretch, Lavinia, bear with a wretch, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nwho feels the noble sacrifices you make for him, but is goaded almost to\r\nmadness,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sampson slapped his forehead, \xe2\x80\x98when he thinks of competing\r\nwith the rich and influential.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you have to compete with the rich and influential, it will\r\nprobably be mentioned to you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Lavvy, \xe2\x80\x98in good time. At least,\r\nit will if the case is MY case.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sampson immediately expressed his fervent Opinion that this was \xe2\x80\x98more\r\nthan human\xe2\x80\x99, and was brought upon his knees at Miss Lavinia\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\nIt was the crowning addition indispensable to the full enjoyment of both\r\nmother and daughter, to bear Mr Sampson, a grateful captive, into the\r\nglittering halls he had mentioned, and to parade him through the same,\r\nat once a living witness of their glory, and a bright instance of their\r\ncondescension. Ascending the staircase, Miss Lavinia permitted him to\r\nwalk at her side, with the air of saying: \xe2\x80\x98Notwithstanding all these\r\nsurroundings, I am yours as yet, George. How long it may last is another\r\nquestion, but I am yours as yet.\xe2\x80\x99 She also benignantly intimated to him,\r\naloud, the nature of the objects upon which he looked, and to which he\r\nwas unaccustomed: as, \xe2\x80\x98Exotics, George,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98An aviary, George,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98An\r\normolu clock, George,\xe2\x80\x99 and the like. While, through the whole of the\r\ndecorations, Mrs Wilfer led the way with the bearing of a Savage Chief,\r\nwho would feel himself compromised by manifesting the slightest token of\r\nsurprise or admiration.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the bearing of this impressive woman, throughout the day, was a\r\npattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances. She renewed\r\nthe acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin, as if Mr and Mrs Boffin had said\r\nof her what she had said of them, and as if Time alone could quite wear\r\nher injury out. She regarded every servant who approached her, as her\r\nsworn enemy, expressly intending to offer her affronts with the dishes,\r\nand to pour forth outrages on her moral feelings from the decanters.\r\nShe sat erect at table, on the right hand of her son-in-law, as half\r\nsuspecting poison in the viands, and as bearing up with native force of\r\ncharacter against other deadly ambushes. Her carriage towards Bella was\r\nas a carriage towards a young lady of good position, whom she had met in\r\nsociety a few years ago. Even when, slightly thawing under the influence\r\nof sparkling champagne, she related to her son-in-law some passages of\r\ndomestic interest concerning her papa, she infused into the narrative\r\nsuch Arctic suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to\r\nmankind, since her papa\xe2\x80\x99s days, and also of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s having\r\nbeen a frosty impersonation of a frosty race, as struck cold to the\r\nvery soles of the feet of the hearers. The Inexhaustible being produced,\r\nstaring, and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly, no\r\nsooner beheld her, than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable. When\r\nshe took her leave at last, it would have been hard to say whether it\r\nwas with the air of going to the scaffold herself, or of leaving the\r\ninmates of the house for immediate execution. Yet, John Harmon enjoyed\r\nit all merrily, and told his wife, when he and she were alone, that her\r\nnatural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil,\r\nand that although he did not dispute her being her father\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nhe should ever remain stedfast in the faith that she could not be her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis visit was, as has been said, a grand event. Another event, not\r\ngrand but deemed in the house a special one, occurred at about the same\r\nperiod; and this was, the first interview between Mr Sloppy and Miss\r\nWren.\r\n\r\nThe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker, being at work for the Inexhaustible upon a\r\nfull-dressed doll some two sizes larger than that young person, Mr\r\nSloppy undertook to call for it, and did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, who was working at her bench. \xe2\x80\x98And who\r\nmay you be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sloppy introduced himself by name and buttons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Jenny. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! I have been looking forward to knowing\r\nyou. I heard of your distinguishing yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99 grinned Sloppy. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure I am glad to hear it, but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pitching somebody into a mud-cart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! That way!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sloppy. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Miss.\xe2\x80\x99 And threw back his head and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless us!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Wren, with a start. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t open your mouth\r\nas wide as that, young man, or it\xe2\x80\x99ll catch so, and not shut again some\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sloppy opened it, if possible, wider, and kept it open until his\r\nlaugh was out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re like the giant,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98when he came home in the\r\nland of Beanstalk, and wanted Jack for supper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he good-looking, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sloppy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Ugly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer visitor glanced round the room--which had many comforts in it now,\r\nthat had not been in it before--and said: \xe2\x80\x98This is a pretty place,\r\nMiss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad you think so, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98And what do you think of\r\nMe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe honesty of Mr Sloppy being severely taxed by the question, he\r\ntwisted a button, grinned, and faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Out with it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, with an arch look. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think me\r\na queer little comicality?\xe2\x80\x99 In shaking her head at him after asking the\r\nquestion, she shook her hair down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Sloppy, in a burst of admiration. \xe2\x80\x98What a lot, and what a\r\ncolour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Wren, with her usual expressive hitch, went on with her work. But,\r\nleft her hair as it was; not displeased by the effect it had made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t live here alone; do you, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sloppy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren, with a chop. \xe2\x80\x98Live here with my fairy godmother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With;\xe2\x80\x99 Mr Sloppy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out; \xe2\x80\x98with who did you say, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren, more seriously. \xe2\x80\x98With my second father. Or\r\nwith my first, for that matter.\xe2\x80\x99 And she shook her head, and drew a\r\nsigh. \xe2\x80\x98If you had known a poor child I used to have here,\xe2\x80\x99 she added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99d have understood me. But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t. All the\r\nbetter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must have been taught a long time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, glancing at the\r\narray of dolls in hand, \xe2\x80\x98before you came to work so neatly, Miss, and\r\nwith such a pretty taste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was taught a stitch, young man!\xe2\x80\x99 returned the dress-maker,\r\ntossing her head. \xe2\x80\x98Just gobbled and gobbled, till I found out how to do\r\nit. Badly enough at first, but better now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And here have I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, in something of a self-reproachful tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98been a learning and a learning, and here has Mr Boffin been a paying\r\nand a paying, ever so long!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard what your trade is,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Miss Wren; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncabinet-making.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr Sloppy nodded. \xe2\x80\x98Now that the Mounds is done with, it is. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what, Miss. I should like to make you something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much obliged. But what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could make you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, surveying the room, \xe2\x80\x98I could make you\r\na handy set of nests to lay the dolls in. Or I could make you a handy\r\nlittle set of drawers, to keep your silks and threads and scraps in. Or\r\nI could turn you a rare handle for that crutch-stick, if it belongs to\r\nhim you call your father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It belongs to me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the little creature, with a quick flush of\r\nher face and neck. \xe2\x80\x98I am lame.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Sloppy flushed too, for there was an instinctive delicacy behind\r\nhis buttons, and his own hand had struck it. He said, perhaps, the best\r\nthing in the way of amends that could be said. \xe2\x80\x98I am very glad it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyours, because I\xe2\x80\x99d rather ornament it for you than for any one else.\r\nPlease may I look at it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Wren was in the act of handing it to him over her bench, when she\r\npaused. \xe2\x80\x98But you had better see me use it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, sharply. \xe2\x80\x98This is\r\nthe way. Hoppetty, Kicketty, Pep-peg-peg. Not pretty; is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems to me that you hardly want it at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy.\r\n\r\nThe little dressmaker sat down again, and gave it into his hand, saying,\r\nwith that better look upon her, and with a smile: \xe2\x80\x98Thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as concerning the nests and the drawers,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy, after\r\nmeasuring the handle on his sleeve, and softly standing the stick aside\r\nagainst the wall, \xe2\x80\x98why, it would be a real pleasure to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heerd\r\ntell that you can sing most beautiful; and I should be better paid with\r\na song than with any money, for I always loved the likes of that, and\r\noften giv\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs Higden and Johnny a comic song myself, with \xe2\x80\x9cSpoken\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nit. Though that\xe2\x80\x99s not your sort, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wager.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a very kind young man,\xe2\x80\x99 returned the dressmaker; \xe2\x80\x98a really kind\r\nyoung man. I accept your offer.--I suppose He won\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x99 she added as\r\nan afterthought, shrugging her shoulders; \xe2\x80\x98and if he does, he may!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meaning him that you call your father, Miss,\xe2\x80\x99 asked Sloppy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Him, Him, Him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Him, him, him?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Sloppy; staring about, as if for Him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Him who is coming to court and marry me,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\r\nhow slow you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! HIM!\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy. And seemed to turn thoughtful and a little\r\ntroubled. \xe2\x80\x98I never thought of him. When is he coming, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a question!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98How should I know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is he coming from, Miss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, good gracious, how can I tell! He is coming from somewhere or\r\nother, I suppose, and he is coming some day or other, I suppose. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow any more about him, at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis tickled Mr Sloppy as an extraordinarily good joke, and he threw\r\nback his head and laughed with measureless enjoyment. At the sight of\r\nhim laughing in that absurd way, the dolls\xe2\x80\x99 dressmaker laughed very\r\nheartily indeed. So they both laughed, till they were tired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, there, there!\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Wren. \xe2\x80\x98For goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake, stop, Giant,\r\nor I shall be swallowed up alive, before I know it. And to this minute\r\nyou haven\xe2\x80\x99t said what you\xe2\x80\x99ve come for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have come for little Miss Harmonses doll,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought as much,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Miss Wren, \xe2\x80\x98and here is little Miss\r\nHarmonses doll waiting for you. She\xe2\x80\x99s folded up in silver paper, you\r\nsee, as if she was wrapped from head to foot in new Bank notes. Take\r\ncare of her, and there\xe2\x80\x99s my hand, and thank you again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take more care of her than if she was a gold image,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sloppy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and there\xe2\x80\x99s both MY hands, Miss, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon come back again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, the greatest event of all, in the new life of Mr and Mrs John\r\nHarmon, was a visit from Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn. Sadly wan and worn\r\nwas the once gallant Eugene, and walked resting on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and\r\nleaning heavily upon a stick. But, he was daily growing stronger and\r\nbetter, and it was declared by the medical attendants that he might not\r\nbe much disfigured by-and-by. It was a grand event, indeed, when Mr\r\nand Mrs Eugene Wrayburn came to stay at Mr and Mrs John Harmon\xe2\x80\x99s house:\r\nwhere, by the way, Mr and Mrs Boffin (exquisitely happy, and daily\r\ncruising about, to look at shops,) were likewise staying indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTo Mr Eugene Wrayburn, in confidence, did Mrs John Harmon impart what\r\nshe had known of the state of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s affections, in his reckless\r\ntime. And to Mrs John Harmon, in confidence, did Mr Eugene Wrayburn\r\nimpart that, please God, she should see how his wife had changed him!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I make no protestations,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene; \xe2\x80\x98--who does, who means them!--I\r\nhave made a resolution.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But would you believe, Bella,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed his wife, coming to resume\r\nher nurse\xe2\x80\x99s place at his side, for he never got on well without her:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that on our wedding day he told me he almost thought the best thing he\r\ncould do, was to die?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, Lizzie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that better thing you\r\nsuggested--for your sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, Eugene lying on his couch in his own room upstairs,\r\nLightwood came to chat with him, while Bella took his wife out for a\r\nride. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing short of force will make her go,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene had said; so,\r\nBella had playfully forced her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear old fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene began with Lightwood, reaching up his hand,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come at a better time, for my mind is full, and I\r\nwant to empty it. First, of my present, before I touch upon my future.\r\nM. R. F., who is a much younger cavalier than I, and a professed admirer\r\nof beauty, was so affable as to remark the other day (he paid us a visit\r\nof two days up the river there, and much objected to the accommodation\r\nof the hotel), that Lizzie ought to have her portrait painted. Which,\r\ncoming from M. R. F., may be considered equivalent to a melodramatic\r\nblessing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are getting well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98I mean it. When M. R. F. said that, and followed\r\nit up by rolling the claret (for which he called, and I paid), in his\r\nmouth, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear son, why do you drink this trash?\xe2\x80\x9d it was\r\ntantamount in him--to a paternal benediction on our union, accompanied\r\nwith a gush of tears. The coolness of M. R. F. is not to be measured by\r\nordinary standards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98that I shall ever hear from M. R. F. on\r\nthe subject, and he will continue to saunter through the world with\r\nhis hat on one side. My marriage being thus solemnly recognized at the\r\nfamily altar, I have no further trouble on that score. Next, you really\r\nhave done wonders for me, Mortimer, in easing my money-perplexities, and\r\nwith such a guardian and steward beside me, as the preserver of my life\r\n(I am hardly strong yet, you see, for I am not man enough to refer\r\nto her without a trembling voice--she is so inexpressibly dear to me,\r\nMortimer!), the little that I can call my own will be more than it ever\r\nhas been. It need be more, for you know what it always has been in my\r\nhands. Nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Worse than nothing, I fancy, Eugene. My own small income (I devoutly\r\nwish that my grandfather had left it to the Ocean rather than to me!)\r\nhas been an effective Something, in the way of preventing me from\r\nturning to at Anything. And I think yours has been much the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There spake the voice of wisdom,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene. \xe2\x80\x98We are shepherds both.\r\nIn turning to at last, we turn to in earnest. Let us say no more of\r\nthat, for a few years to come. Now, I have had an idea, Mortimer, of\r\ntaking myself and my wife to one of the colonies, and working at my\r\nvocation there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be lost without you, Eugene; but you may be right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eugene, emphatically. \xe2\x80\x98Not right. Wrong!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said it with such a lively--almost angry--flash, that Mortimer showed\r\nhimself greatly surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think this thumped head of mine is excited?\xe2\x80\x99 Eugene went on, with a\r\nhigh look; \xe2\x80\x98not so, believe me. I can say to you of the healthful music\r\nof my pulse what Hamlet said of his. My blood is up, but wholesomely up,\r\nwhen I think of it. Tell me! Shall I turn coward to Lizzie, and sneak\r\naway with her, as if I were ashamed of her! Where would your friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart in this world be, Mortimer, if she had turned coward to him, and on\r\nimmeasurably better occasion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Honourable and stanch,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98And yet, Eugene--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet what, Mortimer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet, are you sure that you might not feel (for her sake, I say for\r\nher sake) any slight coldness towards her on the part of--Society?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O! You and I may well stumble at the word,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, laughing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do we mean our Tippins?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mortimer, laughing also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Faith, we DO!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Eugene, with great animation. \xe2\x80\x98We may hide\r\nbehind the bush and beat about it, but we DO! Now, my wife is something\r\nnearer to my heart, Mortimer, than Tippins is, and I owe her a little\r\nmore than I owe to Tippins, and I am rather prouder of her than I ever\r\nwas of Tippins. Therefore, I will fight it out to the last gasp, with\r\nher and for her, here, in the open field. When I hide her, or strike\r\nfor her, faint-heartedly, in a hole or a corner, do you whom I love next\r\nbest upon earth, tell me what I shall most righteously deserve to be\r\ntold:--that she would have done well to turn me over with her foot that\r\nnight when I lay bleeding to death, and spat in my dastard face.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe glow that shone upon him as he spoke the words, so irradiated his\r\nfeatures that he looked, for the time, as though he had never been\r\nmutilated. His friend responded as Eugene would have had him respond,\r\nand they discoursed of the future until Lizzie came back. After resuming\r\nher place at his side, and tenderly touching his hands and his head, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eugene, dear, you made me go out, but I ought to have stayed with you.\r\nYou are more flushed than you have been for many days. What have you\r\nbeen doing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Eugene, \xe2\x80\x98but looking forward to your coming back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And talking to Mr Lightwood,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lizzie, turning to him with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it cannot have been Society that disturbed you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Faith, my dear love!\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Eugene, in his old airy manner, as he\r\nlaughed and kissed her, \xe2\x80\x98I rather think it WAS Society though!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe word ran so much in Mortimer Lightwood\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts as he went home to\r\nthe Temple that night, that he resolved to take a look at Society, which\r\nhe had not seen for a considerable period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 17\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nBehoves Mortimer Lightwood, therefore, to answer a dinner card from Mr\r\nand Mrs Veneering requesting the honour, and to signify that Mr Mortimer\r\nLightwood will be happy to have the other honour. The Veneerings have\r\nbeen, as usual, indefatigably dealing dinner cards to Society, and\r\nwhoever desires to take a hand had best be quick about it, for it is\r\nwritten in the Books of the Insolvent Fates that Veneering shall make a\r\nresounding smash next week. Yes. Having found out the clue to that great\r\nmystery how people can contrive to live beyond their means, and having\r\nover-jobbed his jobberies as legislator deputed to the Universe by the\r\npure electors of Pocket-Breaches, it shall come to pass next week that\r\nVeneering will accept the Chiltern Hundreds, that the legal gentleman in\r\nBritannia\xe2\x80\x99s confidence will again accept the Pocket-Breaches Thousands,\r\nand that the Veneerings will retire to Calais, there to live on Mrs\r\nVeneering\xe2\x80\x99s diamonds (in which Mr Veneering, as a good husband, has from\r\ntime to time invested considerable sums), and to relate to Neptune and\r\nothers, how that, before Veneering retired from Parliament, the House\r\nof Commons was composed of himself and the six hundred and fifty-seven\r\ndearest and oldest friends he had in the world. It shall likewise come\r\nto pass, at as nearly as possible the same period, that Society will\r\ndiscover that it always did despise Veneering, and distrust Veneering,\r\nand that when it went to Veneering\xe2\x80\x99s to dinner it always had\r\nmisgivings--though very secretly at the time, it would seem, and in a\r\nperfectly private and confidential manner.\r\n\r\nThe next week\xe2\x80\x99s books of the Insolvent Fates, however, being not yet\r\nopened, there is the usual rush to the Veneerings, of the people who go\r\nto their house to dine with one another and not with them. There is Lady\r\nTippins. There are Podsnap the Great, and Mrs Podsnap. There is Twemlow.\r\nThere are Buffer, Boots, and Brewer. There is the Contractor, who\r\nis Providence to five hundred thousand men. There is the Chairman,\r\ntravelling three thousand miles per week. There is the brilliant genius\r\nwho turned the shares into that remarkably exact sum of three hundred\r\nand seventy five thousand pounds, no shillings, and nopence.\r\n\r\nTo whom, add Mortimer Lightwood, coming in among them with a\r\nreassumption of his old languid air, founded on Eugene, and belonging to\r\nthe days when he told the story of the man from Somewhere.\r\n\r\nThat fresh fairy, Tippins, all but screams at sight of her false\r\nswain. She summons the deserter to her with her fan; but the deserter,\r\npredetermined not to come, talks Britain with Podsnap. Podsnap always\r\ntalks Britain, and talks as if he were a sort of Private Watchman\r\nemployed, in the British interests, against the rest of the world. \xe2\x80\x98We\r\nknow what Russia means, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap; \xe2\x80\x98we know what France wants;\r\nwe see what America is up to; but we know what England is. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough\r\nfor us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, when dinner is served, and Lightwood drops into his old place\r\nover against Lady Tippins, she can be fended off no longer. \xe2\x80\x98Long\r\nbanished Robinson Crusoe,\xe2\x80\x99 says the charmer, exchanging salutations,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98how did you leave the Island?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lightwood. \xe2\x80\x98It made no complaint of being in pain\r\nanywhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say, how did you leave the savages?\xe2\x80\x99 asks Lady Tippins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They were becoming civilized when I left Juan Fernandez,\xe2\x80\x99 says\r\nLightwood. \xe2\x80\x98At least they were eating one another, which looked like\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tormentor!\xe2\x80\x99 returns the dear young creature. \xe2\x80\x98You know what I mean, and\r\nyou trifle with my impatience. Tell me something, immediately, about the\r\nmarried pair. You were at the wedding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was I, by-the-by?\xe2\x80\x99 Mortimer pretends, at great leisure, to consider.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I was!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was the bride dressed? In rowing costume?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMortimer looks gloomy, and declines to answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope she steered herself, skiffed herself, paddled herself,\r\nlarboarded and starboarded herself, or whatever the technical term may\r\nbe, to the ceremony?\xe2\x80\x99 proceeds the playful Tippins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However she got to it, she graced it,\xe2\x80\x99 says Mortimer.\r\n\r\nLady Tippins with a skittish little scream, attracts the general\r\nattention. \xe2\x80\x98Graced it! Take care of me if I faint, Veneering. He means\r\nto tell us, that a horrid female waterman is graceful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me. I mean to tell you nothing, Lady Tippins,\xe2\x80\x99 replies\r\nLightwood. And keeps his word by eating his dinner with a show of the\r\nutmost indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall not escape me in this way, you morose backwoodsman,\xe2\x80\x99 retorts\r\nLady Tippins. \xe2\x80\x98You shall not evade the question, to screen your friend\r\nEugene, who has made this exhibition of himself. The knowledge shall be\r\nbrought home to you that such a ridiculous affair is condemned by the\r\nvoice of Society. My dear Mrs Veneering, do let us resolve ourselves\r\ninto a Committee of the whole House on the subject.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Veneering, always charmed by this rattling sylph, cries. \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes!\r\nDo let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole House!\r\nSo delicious!\xe2\x80\x99 Veneering says, \xe2\x80\x98As many as are of that opinion, say\r\nAye,--contrary, No--the Ayes have it.\xe2\x80\x99 But nobody takes the slightest\r\nnotice of his joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, I am Chairwoman of Committees!\xe2\x80\x99 cries Lady Tippins.\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98What spirits she has!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaims Mrs Veneering; to whom likewise nobody\r\nattends.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And this,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues the sprightly one, \xe2\x80\x98is a Committee of the whole\r\nHouse to what-you-may-call-it--elicit, I suppose--the voice of Society.\r\nThe question before the Committee is, whether a young man of very fair\r\nfamily, good appearance, and some talent, makes a fool or a wise man of\r\nhimself in marrying a female waterman, turned factory girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hardly so, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 the stubborn Mortimer strikes in. \xe2\x80\x98I take the\r\nquestion to be, whether such a man as you describe, Lady Tippins, does\r\nright or wrong in marrying a brave woman (I say nothing of her beauty),\r\nwho has saved his life, with a wonderful energy and address; whom he\r\nknows to be virtuous, and possessed of remarkable qualities; whom he has\r\nlong admired, and who is deeply attached to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, excuse me,\xe2\x80\x99 says Podsnap, with his temper and his shirt-collar\r\nabout equally rumpled; \xe2\x80\x98was this young woman ever a female waterman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never. But she sometimes rowed in a boat with her father, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGeneral sensation against the young woman. Brewer shakes his head. Boots\r\nshakes his head. Buffer shakes his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now, Mr Lightwood, was she ever,\xe2\x80\x99 pursues Podsnap, with his\r\nindignation rising high into those hair-brushes of his, \xe2\x80\x98a factory\r\ngirl?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never. But she had some employment in a paper mill, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGeneral sensation repeated. Brewer says, \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear!\xe2\x80\x99 Boots says, \xe2\x80\x98Oh\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x99 Buffer says, \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear!\xe2\x80\x99 All, in a rumbling tone of protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then all I have to say is,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Podsnap, putting the thing away\r\nwith his right arm, \xe2\x80\x98that my gorge rises against such a marriage--that\r\nit offends and disgusts me--that it makes me sick--and that I desire to\r\nknow no more about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Now I wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Mortimer, amused, \xe2\x80\x98whether YOU are the Voice of\r\nSociety!\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear, hear!\xe2\x80\x99 cries Lady Tippins. \xe2\x80\x98Your opinion of this\r\nMESALLIANCE, honourable colleagues of the honourable member who has just\r\nsat down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs Podsnap is of opinion that in these matters there should be an\r\nequality of station and fortune, and that a man accustomed to Society\r\nshould look out for a woman accustomed to Society and capable of bearing\r\nher part in it with--an ease and elegance of carriage--that.\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs\r\nPodsnap stops there, delicately intimating that every such man should\r\nlook out for a fine woman as nearly resembling herself as he may hope to\r\ndiscover.\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x98Now I wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 thinks Mortimer, \xe2\x80\x98whether you are the Voice!\xe2\x80\x99)\r\n\r\nLady Tippins next canvasses the Contractor, of five hundred thousand\r\npower. It appears to this potentate, that what the man in question\r\nshould have done, would have been, to buy the young woman a boat and a\r\nsmall annuity, and set her up for herself. These things are a question\r\nof beefsteaks and porter. You buy the young woman a boat. Very good. You\r\nbuy her, at the same time, a small annuity. You speak of that annuity in\r\npounds sterling, but it is in reality so many pounds of beefsteaks and\r\nso many pints of porter. On the one hand, the young woman has the boat.\r\nOn the other hand, she consumes so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many\r\npints of porter. Those beefsteaks and that porter are the fuel to that\r\nyoung woman\xe2\x80\x99s engine. She derives therefrom a certain amount of power to\r\nrow the boat; that power will produce so much money; you add that to the\r\nsmall annuity; and thus you get at the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s income. That (it\r\nseems to the Contractor) is the way of looking at it.\r\n\r\nThe fair enslaver having fallen into one of her gentle sleeps during the\r\nlast exposition, nobody likes to wake her. Fortunately, she comes\r\nawake of herself, and puts the question to the Wandering Chairman. The\r\nWanderer can only speak of the case as if it were his own. If such a\r\nyoung woman as the young woman described, had saved his own life, he\r\nwould have been very much obliged to her, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have married her, and\r\nwould have got her a berth in an Electric Telegraph Office, where young\r\nwomen answer very well.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Genius of the three hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\npounds, no shillings, and nopence, think? He can\xe2\x80\x99t say what he thinks,\r\nwithout asking: Had the young woman any money?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 says Lightwood, in an uncompromising voice; \xe2\x80\x98no money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Madness and moonshine,\xe2\x80\x99 is then the compressed verdict of the Genius.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A man may do anything lawful, for money. But for no money!--Bosh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat does Boots say?\r\n\r\nBoots says he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it under twenty thousand pound.\r\n\r\nWhat does Brewer say?\r\n\r\nBrewer says what Boots says.\r\n\r\nWhat does Buffer say?\r\n\r\nBuffer says he knows a man who married a bathing-woman, and bolted.\r\n\r\nLady Tippins fancies she has collected the suffrages of the whole\r\nCommittee (nobody dreaming of asking the Veneerings for their opinion),\r\nwhen, looking round the table through her eyeglass, she perceives Mr\r\nTwemlow with his hand to his forehead.\r\n\r\nGood gracious! My Twemlow forgotten! My dearest! My own! What is his\r\nvote?\r\n\r\nTwemlow has the air of being ill at ease, as he takes his hand from his\r\nforehead and replies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am disposed to think,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98that this is a question of the\r\nfeelings of a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A gentleman can have no feelings who contracts such a marriage,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nflushes Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says Twemlow, rather less mildly than usual, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nagree with you. If this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings of gratitude, of respect,\r\nof admiration, and affection, induced him (as I presume they did) to\r\nmarry this lady--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This lady!\xe2\x80\x99 echoes Podsnap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 returns Twemlow, with his wristbands bristling a little, \xe2\x80\x98YOU\r\nrepeat the word; I repeat the word. This lady. What else would you call\r\nher, if the gentleman were present?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis being something in the nature of a poser for Podsnap, he merely\r\nwaves it away with a speechless wave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say,\xe2\x80\x99 resumes Twemlow, \xe2\x80\x98if such feelings on the part of this\r\ngentleman, induced this gentleman to marry this lady, I think he is the\r\ngreater gentleman for the action, and makes her the greater lady. I beg\r\nto say, that when I use the word, gentleman, I use it in the sense in\r\nwhich the degree may be attained by any man. The feelings of a gentleman\r\nI hold sacred, and I confess I am not comfortable when they are made the\r\nsubject of sport or general discussion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to know,\xe2\x80\x99 sneers Podsnap, \xe2\x80\x98whether your noble relation\r\nwould be of your opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Podsnap,\xe2\x80\x99 retorts Twemlow, \xe2\x80\x98permit me. He might be, or he might not\r\nbe. I cannot say. But, I could not allow even him to dictate to me on a\r\npoint of great delicacy, on which I feel very strongly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow, a canopy of wet blanket seems to descend upon the company, and\r\nLady Tippins was never known to turn so very greedy or so very cross.\r\nMortimer Lightwood alone brightens. He has been asking himself, as to\r\nevery other member of the Committee in turn, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether you are\r\nthe Voice!\xe2\x80\x99 But he does not ask himself the question after Twemlow has\r\nspoken, and he glances in Twemlow\xe2\x80\x99s direction as if he were grateful.\r\nWhen the company disperse--by which time Mr and Mrs Veneering have had\r\nquite as much as they want of the honour, and the guests have had quite\r\nas much as THEY want of the other honour--Mortimer sees Twemlow home,\r\nshakes hands with him cordially at parting, and fares to the Temple,\r\ngaily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\nIN LIEU OF PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I devised this story, I foresaw the likelihood that a class of\r\nreaders and commentators would suppose that I was at great pains to\r\nconceal exactly what I was at great pains to suggest: namely, that Mr\r\nJohn Harmon was not slain, and that Mr John Rokesmith was he. Pleasing\r\nmyself with the idea that the supposition might in part arise out\r\nof some ingenuity in the story, and thinking it worth while, in the\r\ninterests of art, to hint to an audience that an artist (of whatever\r\ndenomination) may perhaps be trusted to know what he is about in his\r\nvocation, if they will concede him a little patience, I was not alarmed\r\nby the anticipation.\r\n\r\nTo keep for a long time unsuspected, yet always working itself out,\r\nanother purpose originating in that leading incident, and turning it to\r\na pleasant and useful account at last, was at once the most interesting\r\nand the most difficult part of my design. Its difficulty was much\r\nenhanced by the mode of publication; for, it would be very unreasonable\r\nto expect that many readers, pursuing a story in portions from month\r\nto month through nineteen months, will, until they have it before them\r\ncomplete, perceive the relations of its finer threads to the whole\r\npattern which is always before the eyes of the story-weaver at his loom.\r\nYet, that I hold the advantages of the mode of publication to outweigh\r\nits disadvantages, may be easily believed of one who revived it in the\r\nPickwick Papers after long disuse, and has pursued it ever since.\r\n\r\nThere is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as\r\nimprobable in fiction, what are the commonest experiences in fact.\r\nTherefore, I note here, though it may not be at all necessary, that\r\nthere are hundreds of Will Cases (as they are called), far more\r\nremarkable than that fancied in this book; and that the stores of the\r\nPrerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made,\r\nchanged, contradicted, hidden, forgotten, left cancelled, and left\r\nuncancelled, each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr\r\nHarmon of Harmony Jail.\r\n\r\nIn my social experiences since Mrs Betty Higden came upon the scene and\r\nleft it, I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be\r\nwarm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law. Mr friend Mr\r\nBounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown\r\n\xe2\x80\x98hands\xe2\x80\x99 exactly as they were, and requiring them to be fed with turtle\r\nsoup and venison out of gold spoons. Idiotic propositions of a parallel\r\nnature have been freely offered for my acceptance, and I have been\r\ncalled upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody,\r\nanywhere, anyhow. Putting this nonsense aside, I have observed a\r\nsuspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties; the\r\none, contending that there are no deserving Poor who prefer death by\r\nslow starvation and bitter weather, to the mercies of some Relieving\r\nOfficers and some Union Houses; the other, admitting that there are such\r\nPoor, but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do.\r\nThe records in our newspapers, the late exposure by THE LANCET, and the\r\ncommon sense and senses of common people, furnish too abundant evidence\r\nagainst both defences. But, that my view of the Poor Law may not be\r\nmistaken or misrepresented, I will state it. I believe there has been\r\nin England, since the days of the STUARTS, no law so often infamously\r\nadministered, no law so often openly violated, no law habitually so\r\nill-supervised. In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and\r\ndeath from destitution, that shock the Public and disgrace the country,\r\nthe illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity--and known language\r\ncould say no more of their lawlessness.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the Ninth of June in the present year, Mr and Mrs Boffin (in\r\ntheir manuscript dress of receiving Mr and Mrs Lammle at breakfast)\r\nwere on the South Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive\r\naccident. When I had done what I could to help others, I climbed back\r\ninto my carriage--nearly turned over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon\r\nthe turn--to extricate the worthy couple. They were much soiled, but\r\notherwise unhurt. The same happy result attended Miss Bella Wilfer on\r\nher wedding day, and Mr Riderhood inspecting Bradley Headstone\xe2\x80\x99s red\r\nneckerchief as he lay asleep. I remember with devout thankfulness that I\r\ncan never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever, than\r\nI was then, until there shall be written against my life, the two words\r\nwith which I have this day closed this book:--THE END.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2nd, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Our Mutual Friend, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OUR MUTUAL FRIEND ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 883-0.txt or 883-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/8/8/883/\r\n\r\nProduced by Donald Lainson; David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
