Hogarth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI -- THE TUTOR, KARL IVANITCH\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August, 18-- (just three days after my tenth birthday,\r\nwhen I had been given such wonderful presents), I was awakened at seven\r\no\'clock in the morning by Karl Ivanitch slapping the wall close to my\r\nhead with a fly-flap made of sugar paper and a stick. He did this so\r\nroughly that he hit the image of my patron saint suspended to the oaken\r\nback of my bed, and the dead fly fell down on my curls. I peeped out\r\nfrom under the coverlet, steadied the still shaking image with my hand,\r\nflicked the dead fly on to the floor, and gazed at Karl Ivanitch with\r\nsleepy, wrathful eyes. He, in a parti-coloured wadded dressing-gown\r\nfastened about the waist with a wide belt of the same material, a red\r\nknitted cap adorned with a tassel, and soft slippers of goat skin, went\r\non walking round the walls and taking aim at, and slapping, flies.\r\n\r\n"Suppose," I thought to myself, "that I am only a small boy, yet why\r\nshould he disturb me? Why does he not go killing flies around Woloda\'s\r\nbed? No; Woloda is older than I, and I am the youngest of the family, so\r\nhe torments me. That is what he thinks of all day long--how to tease\r\nme. He knows very well that he has woken me up and frightened me, but he\r\npretends not to notice it. Disgusting brute! And his dressing-gown and\r\ncap and tassel too--they are all of them disgusting."\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus inwardly venting my wrath upon Karl Ivanitch, he had\r\npassed to his own bedstead, looked at his watch (which hung suspended in\r\na little shoe sewn with bugles), and deposited the fly-flap on a nail,\r\nthen, evidently in the most cheerful mood possible, he turned round to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n"Get up, children! It is quite time, and your mother is already in the\r\ndrawing-room," he exclaimed in his strong German accent. Then he crossed\r\nover to me, sat down at my feet, and took his snuff-box out of his\r\npocket. I pretended to be asleep. Karl Ivanitch sneezed, wiped his\r\nnose, flicked his fingers, and began amusing himself by teasing me and\r\ntickling my toes as he said with a smile, "Well, well, little lazy one!"\r\n\r\nFor all my dread of being tickled, I determined not to get out of bed\r\nor to answer him, but hid my head deeper in the pillow, kicked out with\r\nall my strength, and strained every nerve to keep from laughing.\r\n\r\n"How kind he is, and how fond of us!" I thought to myself. "Yet to think\r\nthat I could be hating him so just now!"\r\n\r\nI felt angry, both with myself and with Karl Ivanitch, I wanted to laugh\r\nand to cry at the same time, for my nerves were all on edge.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone, Karl!" I exclaimed at length, with tears in my eyes, as\r\nI raised my head from beneath the bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nKarl Ivanitch was taken aback. He left off tickling my feet, and asked\r\nme kindly what the matter was. Had I had a disagreeable dream? His good\r\nGerman face and the sympathy with which he sought to know the cause\r\nof my tears made them flow the faster. I felt conscience-stricken, and\r\ncould not understand how, only a minute ago, I had been hating Karl,\r\nand thinking his dressing-gown and cap and tassel disgusting. On the\r\ncontrary, they looked eminently lovable now. Even the tassel seemed\r\nanother token of his goodness. I replied that I was crying because I had\r\nhad a bad dream, and had seen Mamma dead and being buried. Of course it\r\nwas a mere invention, since I did not remember having dreamt anything\r\nat all that night, but the truth was that Karl\'s sympathy as he tried to\r\ncomfort and reassure me had gradually made me believe that I HAD dreamt\r\nsuch a horrible dream, and so weep the more--though from a different\r\ncause to the one he imagined.\r\n\r\nWhen Karl Ivanitch had left me, I sat up in bed and proceeded to draw\r\nmy stockings over my little feet. The tears had quite dried now, yet the\r\nmournful thought of the invented dream was still haunting me a little.\r\nPresently Uncle [This term is often applied by children to old servants\r\nin Russia] Nicola came in--a neat little man who was always grave,\r\nmethodical, and respectful, as well as a great friend of Karl\'s. He\r\nbrought with him our clothes and boots--at least, boots for Woloda, and\r\nfor myself the old detestable, be-ribanded shoes. In his presence I\r\nfelt ashamed to cry, and, moreover, the morning sun was shining so gaily\r\nthrough the window, and Woloda, standing at the washstand as he mimicked\r\nMaria Ivanovna (my sister\'s governess), was laughing so loud and so\r\nlong, that even the serious Nicola--a towel over his shoulder, the soap\r\nin one hand, and the basin in the other--could not help smiling as he\r\nsaid, "Will you please let me wash you, Vladimir Petrovitch?" I had\r\ncheered up completely.\r\n\r\n"Are you nearly ready?" came Karl\'s voice from the schoolroom. The tone\r\nof that voice sounded stern now, and had nothing in it of the kindness\r\nwhich had just touched me so much. In fact, in the schoolroom Karl was\r\naltogether a different man from what he was at other times. There he was\r\nthe tutor. I washed and dressed myself hurriedly, and, a brush still\r\nin my hand as I smoothed my wet hair, answered to his call. Karl,\r\nwith spectacles on nose and a book in his hand, was sitting, as usual,\r\nbetween the door and one of the windows. To the left of the door were\r\ntwo shelves--one of them the children\'s (that is to say, ours), and the\r\nother one Karl\'s own. Upon ours were heaped all sorts of books--lesson\r\nbooks and play books--some standing up and some lying down. The only\r\ntwo standing decorously against the wall were two large volumes of a\r\nHistoire des Voyages, in red binding. On that shelf could be seen books\r\nthick and thin and books large and small, as well as covers without\r\nbooks and books without covers, since everything got crammed up together\r\nanyhow when play time arrived and we were told to put the "library" (as\r\nKarl called these shelves) in order. The collection of books on his own\r\nshelf was, if not so numerous as ours, at least more varied. Three of\r\nthem in particular I remember, namely, a German pamphlet (minus a cover)\r\non Manuring Cabbages in Kitchen-Gardens, a History of the Seven Years\'\r\nWar (bound in parchment and burnt at one corner), and a Course of\r\nHydrostatics. Though Karl passed so much of his time in reading that he\r\nhad injured his sight by doing so, he never read anything beyond these\r\nbooks and The Northern Bee.\r\n\r\nAnother article on Karl\'s shelf I remember well. This was a round piece\r\nof cardboard fastened by a screw to a wooden stand, with a sort of comic\r\npicture of a lady and a hairdresser glued to the cardboard. Karl was\r\nvery clever at fixing pieces of cardboard together, and had devised this\r\ncontrivance for shielding his weak eyes from any very strong light.\r\n\r\nI can see him before me now--the tall figure in its wadded dressing-gown\r\nand red cap (a few grey hairs visible beneath the latter) sitting beside\r\nthe table; the screen with the hairdresser shading his face; one hand\r\nholding a book, and the other one resting on the arm of the chair.\r\nBefore him lie his watch, with a huntsman painted on the dial, a\r\ncheck cotton handkerchief, a round black snuff-box, and a green\r\nspectacle-case. The neatness and orderliness of all these articles show\r\nclearly that Karl Ivanitch has a clear conscience and a quiet mind.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when tired of running about the salon downstairs, I would\r\nsteal on tiptoe to the schoolroom and find Karl sitting alone in his\r\narmchair as, with a grave and quiet expression on his face, he perused\r\none of his favourite books. Yet sometimes, also, there were moments when\r\nhe was not reading, and when the spectacles had slipped down his large\r\naquiline nose, and the blue, half-closed eyes and faintly smiling lips\r\nseemed to be gazing before them with a curious expression. All would be\r\nquiet in the room--not a sound being audible save his regular breathing\r\nand the ticking of the watch with the hunter painted on the dial. He\r\nwould not see me, and I would stand at the door and think: "Poor, poor\r\nold man! There are many of us, and we can play together and be happy,\r\nbut he sits there all alone, and has nobody to be fond of him. Surely\r\nhe speaks truth when he says that he is an orphan. And the story of his\r\nlife, too--how terrible it is! I remember him telling it to Nicola. How\r\ndreadful to be in his position!" Then I would feel so sorry for him that\r\nI would go to him, and take his hand, and say, "Dear Karl Ivanitch!"\r\nand he would be visibly delighted whenever I spoke to him like this, and\r\nwould look much brighter.\r\n\r\nOn the second wall of the schoolroom hung some maps--mostly torn, but\r\nglued together again by Karl\'s hand. On the third wall (in the middle of\r\nwhich stood the door) hung, on one side of the door, a couple of rulers\r\n(one of them ours--much bescratched, and the other one his--quite a new\r\none), with, on the further side of the door, a blackboard on which our\r\nmore serious faults were marked by circles and our lesser faults by\r\ncrosses. To the left of the blackboard was the corner in which we had to\r\nkneel when naughty. How well I remember that corner--the shutter on the\r\nstove, the ventilator above it, and the noise which it made when turned!\r\nSometimes I would be made to stay in that corner till my back and knees\r\nwere aching all over, and I would think to myself. "Has Karl Ivanitch\r\nforgotten me? He goes on sitting quietly in his arm-chair and reading\r\nhis Hydrostatics, while I--!" Then, to remind him of my presence, I\r\nwould begin gently turning the ventilator round. Or scratching some\r\nplaster off the wall; but if by chance an extra large piece fell upon\r\nthe floor, the fright of it was worse than any punishment. I would\r\nglance round at Karl, but he would still be sitting there quietly, book\r\nin hand, and pretending that he had noticed nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room stood a table, covered with a torn black\r\noilcloth so much cut about with penknives that the edge of the table\r\nshowed through. Round the table stood unpainted chairs which, through\r\nuse, had attained a high degree of polish. The fourth and last wall\r\ncontained three windows, from the first of which the view was as\r\nfollows. Immediately beneath it there ran a high road on which every\r\nirregularity, every pebble, every rut was known and dear to me. Beside\r\nthe road stretched a row of lime-trees, through which glimpses could be\r\ncaught of a wattled fence, with a meadow with farm buildings on one side\r\nof it and a wood on the other--the whole bounded by the keeper\'s hut at\r\nthe further end of the meadow. The next window to the right overlooked\r\nthe part of the terrace where the "grownups" of the family used to sit\r\nbefore luncheon. Sometimes, when Karl was correcting our exercises, I\r\nwould look out of that window and see Mamma\'s dark hair and the backs\r\nof some persons with her, and hear the murmur of their talking and\r\nlaughter. Then I would feel vexed that I could not be there too, and\r\nthink to myself, "When am I going to be grown up, and to have no more\r\nlessons, but sit with the people whom I love instead of with these\r\nhorrid dialogues in my hand?" Then my anger would change to sadness, and\r\nI would fall into such a reverie that I never heard Karl when he scolded\r\nme for my mistakes.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the morning of which I am speaking, Karl Ivanitch took\r\noff his dressing-gown, put on his blue frockcoat with its creased and\r\ncrumpled shoulders, adjusted his tie before the looking-glass, and took\r\nus down to greet Mamma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII -- MAMMA\r\n\r\nMamma was sitting in the drawing-room and making tea. In one hand she\r\nwas holding the tea-pot, while with the other one she was drawing water\r\nfrom the urn and letting it drip into the tray. Yet though she appeared\r\nto be noticing what she doing, in reality she noted neither this fact\r\nnor our entry.\r\n\r\nHowever vivid be one\'s recollection of the past, any attempt to recall\r\nthe features of a beloved being shows them to one\'s vision as through\r\na mist of tears--dim and blurred. Those tears are the tears of the\r\nimagination. When I try to recall Mamma as she was then, I see, true,\r\nher brown eyes, expressive always of love and kindness, the small mole\r\non her neck below where the small hairs grow, her white embroidered\r\ncollar, and the delicate, fresh hand which so often caressed me,\r\nand which I so often kissed; but her general appearance escapes me\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the sofa stood an English piano, at which my dark-haired\r\nsister Lubotshka was sitting and playing with manifest effort (for\r\nher hands were rosy from a recent washing in cold water) Clementi\'s\r\n"Etudes." Then eleven years old, she was dressed in a short cotton frock\r\nand white lace-frilled trousers, and could take her octaves only in\r\narpeggio. Beside her was sitting Maria Ivanovna, in a cap adorned\r\nwith pink ribbons and a blue shawl. Her face was red and cross, and it\r\nassumed an expression even more severe when Karl Ivanitch entered the\r\nroom. Looking angrily at him without answering his bow, she went on\r\nbeating time with her foot and counting, "One, two, three--one, two,\r\nthree," more loudly and commandingly than ever.\r\n\r\nKarl Ivanitch paid no attention to this rudeness, but went, as usual,\r\nwith German politeness to kiss Mamma\'s hand. She drew herself up, shook\r\nher head as though by the movement to chase away sad thoughts from her,\r\nand gave Karl her hand, kissing him on his wrinkled temple as he bent\r\nhis head in salutation.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, dear Karl Ivanitch," she said in German, and then, still\r\nusing the same language asked him how we (the children) had slept.\r\nKarl Ivanitch was deaf in one ear, and the added noise of the piano now\r\nprevented him from hearing anything at all. He moved nearer to the sofa,\r\nand, leaning one hand upon the table and lifting his cap above his\r\nhead, said with, a smile which in those days always seemed to me the\r\nperfection of politeness: "You, will excuse me, will you not, Natalia\r\nNicolaevna?"\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was that, to avoid catching cold, Karl never took\r\noff his red cap, but invariably asked permission, on entering the\r\ndrawing-room, to retain it on his head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, pray replace it, Karl Ivanitch," said Mamma, bending towards him\r\nand raising her voice, "But I asked you whether the children had slept\r\nwell?"\r\n\r\nStill he did not hear, but, covering his bald head again with the red\r\ncap, went on smiling more than ever.\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, Mimi," said Mamma (now smiling also) to Maria Ivanovna.\r\n"It is impossible to hear anything."\r\n\r\nHow beautiful Mamma\'s face was when she smiled! It made her so\r\ninfinitely more charming, and everything around her seemed to grow\r\nbrighter! If in the more painful moments of my life I could have seen\r\nthat smile before my eyes, I should never have known what grief is. In\r\nmy opinion, it is in the smile of a face that the essence of what we\r\ncall beauty lies. If the smile heightens the charm of the face, then the\r\nface is a beautiful one. If the smile does not alter the face, then the\r\nface is an ordinary one. But if the smile spoils the face, then the face\r\nis an ugly one indeed.\r\n\r\nMamma took my head between her hands, bent it gently backwards, looked\r\nat me gravely, and said: "You have been crying this morning?"\r\n\r\nI did not answer. She kissed my eyes, and said again in German: "Why did\r\nyou cry?"\r\n\r\nWhen talking to us with particular intimacy she always used this\r\nlanguage, which she knew to perfection.\r\n\r\n"I cried about a dream, Mamma" I replied, remembering the invented\r\nvision, and trembling involuntarily at the recollection.\r\n\r\nKarl Ivanitch confirmed my words, but said nothing as to the subject of\r\nthe dream. Then, after a little conversation on the weather, in which\r\nMimi also took part, Mamma laid some lumps of sugar on the tray for\r\none or two of the more privileged servants, and crossed over to her\r\nembroidery frame, which stood near one of the windows.\r\n\r\n"Go to Papa now, children," she said, "and ask him to come to me before\r\nhe goes to the home farm."\r\n\r\nThen the music, the counting, and the wrathful looks from Mimi began\r\nagain, and we went off to see Papa. Passing through the room which had\r\nbeen known ever since Grandpapa\'s time as "the pantry," we entered the\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII -- PAPA\r\n\r\nHe was standing near his writing-table, and pointing angrily to some\r\nenvelopes, papers, and little piles of coin upon it as he addressed some\r\nobservations to the bailiff, Jakoff Michaelovitch, who was standing in\r\nhis usual place (that is to say, between the door and the barometer)\r\nand rapidly closing and unclosing the fingers of the hand which he held\r\nbehind his back. The more angry Papa grew, the more rapidly did those\r\nfingers twirl, and when Papa ceased speaking they came to rest also.\r\nYet, as soon as ever Jakoff himself began to talk, they flew here,\r\nthere, and everywhere with lightning rapidity. These movements always\r\nappeared to me an index of Jakoff\'s secret thoughts, though his face was\r\ninvariably placid, and expressive alike of dignity and submissiveness,\r\nas who should say, "I am right, yet let it be as you wish." On seeing\r\nus, Papa said, "Directly--wait a moment," and looked towards the door as\r\na hint for it to be shut.\r\n\r\n"Gracious heavens! What can be the matter with you to-day, Jakoff?" he\r\nwent on with a hitch of one shoulder (a habit of his). "This envelope\r\nhere with the 800 roubles enclosed,"--Jacob took out a set of tablets,\r\nput down "800" and remained looking at the figures while he waited\r\nfor what was to come next--"is for expenses during my absence. Do you\r\nunderstand? From the mill you ought to receive 1000 roubles. Is not\r\nthat so? And from the Treasury mortgage you ought to receive some 8000\r\nroubles. From the hay--of which, according to your calculations, we\r\nshall be able to sell 7000 poods [The pood = 40 lbs.]at 45 copecks a\r\npiece there should come in 3000. Consequently the sum-total that you\r\nought to have in hand soon is--how much?--12,000 roubles. Is that\r\nright?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely," answered Jakoff. Yet by the extreme rapidity with which\r\nhis fingers were twitching I could see that he had an objection to make.\r\nPapa went on:\r\n\r\n"Well, of this money you will send 10,000 roubles to the Petrovskoe\r\nlocal council. As for the money already at the office, you will remit it\r\nto me, and enter it as spent on this present date." Jakoff turned over\r\nthe tablet marked "12,000," and put down "21,000"--seeming, by his\r\naction, to imply that 12,000 roubles had been turned over in the\r\nsame fashion as he had turned the tablet. "And this envelope with the\r\nenclosed money," concluded Papa, "you will deliver for me to the person\r\nto whom it is addressed."\r\n\r\nI was standing close to the table, and could see the address. It was "To\r\nKarl Ivanitch Mayer." Perhaps Papa had an idea that I had read something\r\nwhich I ought not, for he touched my shoulder with his hand and made me\r\naware, by a slight movement, that I must withdraw from the table. Not\r\nsure whether the movement was meant for a caress or a command, I kissed\r\nthe large, sinewy hand which rested upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Jakoff. "And what are your orders about the accounts\r\nfor the money from Chabarovska?" (Chabarovska was Mamma\'s village.)\r\n\r\n"Only that they are to remain in my office, and not to be taken thence\r\nwithout my express instructions."\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Jakoff was silent. Then his fingers began to twitch\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity, and, changing the expression of deferential\r\nvacancy with which he had listened to his orders for one of shrewd\r\nintelligence, he turned his tablets back and spoke.\r\n\r\n"Will you allow me to inform you, Peter Alexandritch," he said, with\r\nfrequent pauses between his words, "that, however much you wish it, it\r\nis out of the question to repay the local council now. You enumerated\r\nsome items, I think, as to what ought to come in from the mortgage, the\r\nmill, and the hay (he jotted down each of these items on his tablets\r\nagain as he spoke). Yet I fear that we must have made a mistake\r\nsomewhere in the accounts." Here he paused a while, and looked gravely\r\nat Papa.\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"Well, will you be good enough to look for yourself? There is the\r\naccount for the mill. The miller has been to me twice to ask for time,\r\nand I am afraid that he has no money whatever in hand. He is here now.\r\nWould you like to speak to him?"\r\n\r\n"No. Tell me what he says," replied Papa, showing by a movement of his\r\nhead that he had no desire to have speech with the miller.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is easy enough to guess what he says. He declares that there\r\nis no grinding to be got now, and that his last remaining money has gone\r\nto pay for the dam. What good would it do for us to turn him out? As to\r\nwhat you were pleased to say about the mortgage, you yourself are aware\r\nthat your money there is locked up and cannot be recovered at a moment\'s\r\nnotice. I was sending a load of flour to Ivan Afanovitch to-day, and\r\nsent him a letter as well, to which he replies that he would have been\r\nglad to oblige you, Peter Alexandritch, were it not that the matter is\r\nout of his hands now, and that all the circumstances show that it would\r\ntake you at least two months to withdraw the money. From the hay I\r\nunderstood you to estimate a return of 3000 roubles?" (Here Jakoff\r\njotted down "3000" on his tablets, and then looked for a moment from the\r\nfigures to Papa with a peculiar expression on his face.) "Well, surely\r\nyou see for yourself how little that is? And even then we should lose if\r\nwe were to sell the stuff now, for you must know that--"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that he would have had many other arguments to adduce had\r\nnot Papa interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"I cannot make any change in my arrangements," said Papa. "Yet if there\r\nshould REALLY have to be any delay in the recovery of these sums, we\r\ncould borrow what we wanted from the Chabarovska funds."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir." The expression of Jakoff\'s face and the way in which\r\nhe twitched his fingers showed that this order had given him great\r\nsatisfaction. He was a serf, and a most zealous, devoted one, but,\r\nlike all good bailiffs, exacting and parsimonious to a degree in the\r\ninterests of his master. Moreover, he had some queer notions of his own.\r\nHe was forever endeavouring to increase his master\'s property at the\r\nexpense of his mistress\'s, and to prove that it would be impossible to\r\navoid using the rents from her estates for the benefit of Petrovskoe (my\r\nfather\'s village, and the place where we lived). This point he had now\r\ngained and was delighted in consequence.\r\n\r\nPapa then greeted ourselves, and said that if we stayed much longer in\r\nthe country we should become lazy boys; that we were growing quite big\r\nnow, and must set about doing lessons in earnest,\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know that I am starting for Moscow to-night?" he went on,\r\n"and that I am going to take you with me? You will live with Grandmamma,\r\nbut Mamma and the girls will remain here. You know, too, I am sure, that\r\nMamma\'s one consolation will be to hear that you are doing your lessons\r\nwell and pleasing every one around you."\r\n\r\nThe preparations which had been in progress for some days past had\r\nmade us expect some unusual event, but this news left us thunderstruck,\r\nWoloda turned red, and, with a shaking voice, delivered Mamma\'s message\r\nto Papa.\r\n\r\n"So this was what my dream foreboded!" I thought to myself. "God send\r\nthat there come nothing worse!" I felt terribly sorry to have to leave\r\nMamma, but at the same rejoiced to think that I should soon be grown up,\r\n"If we are going to-day, we shall probably have no lessons to do, and\r\nthat will be splendid. However, I am sorry for Karl Ivanitch, for he\r\nwill certainly be dismissed now. That was why that envelope had been\r\nprepared for him. I think I would almost rather stay and do lessons here\r\nthan leave Mamma or hurt poor Karl. He is miserable enough already."\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts crossed my mind I stood looking sadly at the black\r\nribbons on my shoes. After a few words to Karl Ivanitch about the\r\ndepression of the barometer and an injunction to Jakoff not to feed\r\nthe hounds, since a farewell meet was to be held after luncheon, Papa\r\ndisappointed my hopes by sending us off to lessons--though he also\r\nconsoled us by promising to take us out hunting later.\r\n\r\nOn my way upstairs I made a digression to the terrace. Near the door\r\nleading on to it Papa\'s favourite hound, Milka, was lying in the sun and\r\nblinking her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Miloshka," I cried as I caressed her and kissed her nose, "we are going\r\naway today. Good-bye. Perhaps we shall never see each other again." I\r\nwas crying and laughing at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV -- LESSONS\r\n\r\nKarl Ivanitch was in a bad temper. This was clear from his contracted\r\nbrows, and from the way in which he flung his frockcoat into a drawer,\r\nangrily donned his old dressing-gown again, and made deep dints with\r\nhis nails to mark the place in the book of dialogues to which we were\r\nto learn by heart. Woloda began working diligently, but I was too\r\ndistracted to do anything at all. For a long while I stared vacantly\r\nat the book; but tears at the thought of the impending separation kept\r\nrushing to my eyes and preventing me from reading a single word. When at\r\nlength the time came to repeat the dialogues to Karl (who listened to us\r\nwith blinking eyes--a very bad sign), I had no sooner reached the place\r\nwhere some one asks, "Wo kommen Sie her?" ("Where do you come from?")\r\nand some one else answers him, "Ich komme vom Kaffeehaus" ("I come from\r\nthe coffee-house"), than I burst into tears and, for sobbing, could not\r\npronounce, "Haben Sie die Zeitung nicht gelesen?" ("Have you not read the\r\nnewspaper?") at all. Next, when we came to our writing lesson, the tears\r\nkept falling from my eyes and, making a mess on the paper, as though\r\nsome one had written on blotting-paper with water, Karl was very\r\nangry. He ordered me to go down upon my knees, declared that it was all\r\nobstinacy and "puppet-comedy playing" (a favourite expression of his)\r\non my part, threatened me with the ruler, and commanded me to say that\r\nI was sorry. Yet for sobbing and crying I could not get a word out. At\r\nlast--conscious, perhaps, that he was unjust--he departed to Nicola\'s\r\npantry, and slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless their conversation\r\nthere carried to the schoolroom.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard that the children are going to Moscow, Nicola?" said\r\nKarl.\r\n\r\n"Yes. How could I help hearing it?"\r\n\r\nAt this point Nicola seemed to get up for Karl said, "Sit down, Nicola,"\r\nand then locked the door. However, I came out of my corner and crept to\r\nthe door to listen.\r\n\r\n"However much you may do for people, and however fond of them you may\r\nbe, never expect any gratitude, Nicola," said Karl warmly. Nicola, who\r\nwas shoe-cobbling by the window, nodded his head in assent.\r\n\r\n"Twelve years have I lived in this house," went on Karl, lifting his\r\neyes and his snuff-box towards the ceiling, "and before God I can say\r\nthat I have loved them, and worked for them, even more than if they had\r\nbeen my own children. You recollect, Nicola, when Woloda had the fever?\r\nYou recollect how, for nine days and nights, I never closed my eyes as\r\nI sat beside his bed? Yes, at that time I was \'the dear, good Karl\r\nIvanitch\'--I was wanted then; but now"--and he smiled ironically--"the\r\nchildren are growing up, and must go to study in earnest. Perhaps they\r\nnever learnt anything with me, Nicola? Eh?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure they did," replied Nicola, laying his awl down and\r\nstraightening a piece of thread with his hands.\r\n\r\n"No, I am wanted no longer, and am to be turned out. What good are\r\npromises and gratitude? Natalia Nicolaevna"--here he laid his hand upon\r\nhis heart--"I love and revere, but what can SHE I do here? Her will is\r\npowerless in this house."\r\n\r\nHe flung a strip of leather on the floor with an angry gesture. "Yet I\r\nknow who has been playing tricks here, and why I am no longer wanted. It\r\nis because I do not flatter and toady as certain people do. I am in\r\nthe habit of speaking the truth in all places and to all persons," he\r\ncontinued proudly, "God be with these children, for my leaving them will\r\nbenefit them little, whereas I--well, by God\'s help I may be able to\r\nearn a crust of bread somewhere. Nicola, eh?"\r\n\r\nNicola raised his head and looked at Karl as though to consider whether\r\nhe would indeed be able to earn a crust of bread, but he said nothing.\r\nKarl said a great deal more of the same kind--in particular how much\r\nbetter his services had been appreciated at a certain general\'s where\r\nhe had formerly lived (I regretted to hear that). Likewise he spoke of\r\nSaxony, his parents, his friend the tailor, Schonheit (beauty), and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nI sympathised with his distress, and felt dreadfully sorry that he and\r\nPapa (both of whom I loved about equally) had had a difference. Then I\r\nreturned to my corner, crouched down upon my heels, and fell to thinking\r\nhow a reconciliation between them might be effected.\r\n\r\nReturning to the study, Karl ordered me to get up and prepare to write\r\nfrom dictation. When I was ready he sat down with a dignified air in\r\nhis arm-chair, and in a voice which seemed to come from a profound abyss\r\nbegan to dictate: "Von al-len Lei-den-shaf-ten die grau-samste ist. Have\r\nyou written that?" He paused, took a pinch of snuff, and began again:\r\n"Die grausamste ist die Un-dank-bar-keit [The most cruel of all passions\r\nis ingratitude.] a capital U, mind."\r\n\r\nThe last word written, I looked at him, for him to go on.\r\n\r\n"Punctum" (stop), he concluded, with a faintly perceptible smile, as he\r\nsigned to us to hand him our copy-books.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, and in several different tones, and always with an\r\nexpression of the greatest satisfaction, did he read out that sentence,\r\nwhich expressed his predominant thought at the moment. Then he set us\r\nto learn a lesson in history, and sat down near the window. His face did\r\nnot look so depressed now, but, on the contrary, expressed eloquently\r\nthe satisfaction of a man who had avenged himself for an injury dealt\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was a quarter to one o\'clock, but Karl Ivanitch never\r\nthought of releasing us. He merely set us a new lesson to learn. My\r\nfatigue and hunger were increasing in equal proportions, so that I\r\neagerly followed every sign of the approach of luncheon. First came the\r\nhousemaid with a cloth to wipe the plates. Next, the sound of crockery\r\nresounded in the dining-room, as the table was moved and chairs placed\r\nround it. After that, Mimi, Lubotshka, and Katenka. (Katenka was Mimi\'s\r\ndaughter, and twelve years old) came in from the garden, but Foka (the\r\nservant who always used to come and announce luncheon) was not yet to be\r\nseen. Only when he entered was it lawful to throw one\'s books aside and\r\nrun downstairs.\r\n\r\nHark! Steps resounded on the staircase, but they were not Foka\'s. Foka\'s\r\nI had learnt to study, and knew the creaking of his boots well. The door\r\nopened, and a figure unknown to me made its appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV -- THE IDIOT\r\n\r\nThe man who now entered the room was about fifty years old, with a pale,\r\nattenuated face pitted with smallpox, long grey hair, and a scanty beard\r\nof a reddish hue. Likewise he was so tall that, on coming through the\r\ndoorway, he was forced not only to bend his head, but to incline his\r\nwhole body forward. He was dressed in a sort of smock that was much\r\ntorn, and held in his hand a stout staff. As he entered he smote this\r\nstaff upon the floor, and, contracting his brows and opening his mouth\r\nto its fullest extent, laughed in a dreadful, unnatural way. He had lost\r\nthe sight of one eye, and its colourless pupil kept rolling about and\r\nimparting to his hideous face an even more repellent expression than it\r\notherwise bore.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, you are caught!" he exclaimed as he ran to Woloda with little\r\nshort steps and, seizing him round the head, looked at it searchingly.\r\nNext he left him, went to the table, and, with a perfectly serious\r\nexpression on his face, began to blow under the oil-cloth, and to make\r\nthe sign of the cross over it, "O-oh, what a pity! O-oh, how it hurts!\r\nThey are angry! They fly from me!" he exclaimed in a tearful choking\r\nvoice as he glared at Woloda and wiped away the streaming tears with his\r\nsleeve. His voice was harsh and rough, all his movements hysterical and\r\nspasmodic, and his words devoid of sense or connection (for he used no\r\nconjunctions). Yet the tone of that voice was so heartrending, and his\r\nyellow, deformed face at times so sincere and pitiful in its expression,\r\nthat, as one listened to him, it was impossible to repress a mingled\r\nsensation of pity, grief, and fear.\r\n\r\nThis was the idiot Grisha. Whence he had come, or who were his parents,\r\nor what had induced him to choose the strange life which he led, no\r\none ever knew. All that I myself knew was that from his fifteenth year\r\nupwards he had been known as an imbecile who went barefooted both in\r\nwinter and summer, visited convents, gave little images to any one who\r\ncared to take them, and spoke meaningless words which some people took\r\nfor prophecies; that nobody remembered him as being different; that at,\r\nrare intervals he used to call at Grandmamma\'s house; and that by some\r\npeople he was said to be the outcast son of rich parents and a pure,\r\nsaintly soul, while others averred that he was a mere peasant and an\r\nidler.\r\n\r\nAt last the punctual and wished-for Foka arrived, and we went\r\ndownstairs. Grisha followed us sobbing and continuing to talk nonsense,\r\nand knocking his staff on each step of the staircase. When we entered\r\nthe drawing-room we found Papa and Mamma walking up and down there, with\r\ntheir hands clasped in each other\'s, and talking in low tones. Maria\r\nIvanovna was sitting bolt upright in an arm-chair placed at tight angles\r\nto the sofa, and giving some sort of a lesson to the two girls sitting\r\nbeside her. When Karl Ivanitch entered the room she looked at him for a\r\nmoment, and then turned her eyes away with an expression which seemed to\r\nsay, "You are beneath my notice, Karl Ivanitch." It was easy to see from\r\nthe girls\' eyes that they had important news to communicate to us as\r\nsoon as an opportunity occurred (for to leave their seats and approach\r\nus first was contrary to Mimi\'s rules). It was for us to go to her\r\nand say, "Bon jour, Mimi," and then make her a low bow; after which we\r\nshould possibly be permitted to enter into conversation with the girls.\r\n\r\nWhat an intolerable creature that Mimi was! One could hardly say a word\r\nin her presence without being found fault with. Also whenever we wanted\r\nto speak in Russian, she would say, "Parlez, donc, francais," as though\r\non purpose to annoy us, while, if there was any particularly nice\r\ndish at luncheon which we wished to enjoy in peace, she would keep on\r\nejaculating, "Mangez, donc, avec du pain!" or, "Comment est-ce que vous\r\ntenez votre fourchette?" "What has SHE got to do with us?" I used to\r\nthink to myself. "Let her teach the girls. WE have our Karl Ivanitch." I\r\nshared to the full his dislike of "certain people."\r\n\r\n"Ask Mamma to let us go hunting too," Katenka whispered to me, as she\r\ncaught me by the sleeve just when the elders of the family were making a\r\nmove towards the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"Very well. I will try."\r\n\r\nGrisha likewise took a seat in the dining-room, but at a little table\r\napart from the rest. He never lifted his eyes from his plate, but kept\r\non sighing and making horrible grimaces, as he muttered to himself:\r\n"What a pity! It has flown away! The dove is flying to heaven! The stone\r\nlies on the tomb!" and so forth.\r\n\r\nEver since the morning Mamma had been absent-minded, and Grisha\'s\r\npresence, words, and actions seemed to make her more so.\r\n\r\n"By the way, there is something I forgot to ask you," she said, as she\r\nhanded Papa a plate of soup.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"That you will have those dreadful dogs of yours tied up. They nearly\r\nworried poor Grisha to death when he entered the courtyard, and I am\r\nsure they will bite the children some day."\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Grisha hear himself mentioned that he turned towards our\r\ntable and showed us his torn clothes. Then, as he went on with his meal,\r\nhe said: "He would have let them tear me in pieces, but God would not\r\nallow it! What a sin to let the dogs loose--a great sin! But do not beat\r\nhim, master; do not beat him! It is for God to forgive! It is past now!"\r\n\r\n"What does he say?" said Papa, looking at him gravely and sternly. "I\r\ncannot understand him at all."\r\n\r\n"I think he is saying," replied Mamma, "that one of the huntsmen set\r\nthe dogs on him, but that God would not allow him to be torn in pieces.\r\nTherefore he begs you not to punish the man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, is that it?" said Papa, "How does he know that I intended to\r\npunish the huntsman? You know, I am not very fond of fellows like this,"\r\nhe added in French, "and this one offends me particularly. Should it\r\never happen that--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t say so," interrupted Mamma, as if frightened by some thought.\r\n"How can you know what he is?"\r\n\r\n"I think I have plenty of opportunities for doing so, since no lack of\r\nthem come to see you--all of them the same sort, and probably all with\r\nthe same story."\r\n\r\nI could see that Mamma\'s opinion differed from his, but that she did not\r\nmean to quarrel about it.\r\n\r\n"Please hand me the cakes," she said to him, "Are they good to-day or\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I AM angry," he went on as he took the cakes and put them where\r\nMamma could not reach them, "very angry at seeing supposedly reasonable\r\nand educated people let themselves be deceived," and he struck the table\r\nwith his fork.\r\n\r\n"I asked you to hand me the cakes," she repeated with outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n"And it is a good thing," Papa continued as he put the hand aside, "that\r\nthe police run such vagabonds in. All they are good for is to play upon\r\nthe nerves of certain people who are already not over-strong in\r\nthat respect," and he smiled, observing that Mamma did not like the\r\nconversation at all. However, he handed her the cakes.\r\n\r\n"All that I have to say," she replied, "is that one can hardly believe\r\nthat a man who, though sixty years of age, goes barefooted winter and\r\nsummer, and always wears chains of two pounds\' weight, and never\r\naccepts the offers made to him to live a quiet, comfortable life--it is\r\ndifficult to believe that such a man should act thus out of laziness."\r\nPausing a moment, she added with a sigh: "As to predictions, je suis\r\npayee pour y croire, I told you, I think, that Grisha prophesied the\r\nvery day and hour of poor Papa\'s death?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, what HAVE you gone and done?" said Papa, laughing and putting his\r\nhand to his cheek (whenever he did this I used to look for something\r\nparticularly comical from him). "Why did you call my attention to his\r\nfeet? I looked at them, and now can eat nothing more."\r\n\r\nLuncheon was over now, and Lubotshka and Katenka were winking at us,\r\nfidgeting about in their chairs, and showing great restlessness. The\r\nwinking, of course, signified, "Why don\'t you ask whether we too may go\r\nto the hunt?" I nudged Woloda, and Woloda nudged me back, until at last\r\nI took heart of grace, and began (at first shyly, but gradually with\r\nmore assurance) to ask if it would matter much if the girls too were\r\nallowed to enjoy the sport. Thereupon a consultation was held among the\r\nelder folks, and eventually leave was granted--Mamma, to make things\r\nstill more delightful, saying that she would come too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI -- PREPARATIONS FOR THE CHASE\r\n\r\nDuring dessert Jakoff had been sent for, and orders given him to have\r\nready the carriage, the hounds, and the saddle-horses--every detail\r\nbeing minutely specified, and every horse called by its own particular\r\nname. As Woloda\'s usual mount was lame, Papa ordered a "hunter" to be\r\nsaddled for him; which term, "hunter" so horrified Mamma\'s ears, that\r\nshe imagined it to be some kind of an animal which would at once run\r\naway and bring about Woloda\'s death. Consequently, in spite of all\r\nPapa\'s and Woloda\'s assurances (the latter glibly affirming that it was\r\nnothing, and that he liked his horse to go fast), poor Mamma continued\r\nto exclaim that her pleasure would be quite spoilt for her.\r\n\r\nWhen luncheon was over, the grown-ups had coffee in the study, while\r\nwe younger ones ran into the garden and went chattering along the\r\nundulating paths with their carpet of yellow leaves. We talked about\r\nWoloda\'s riding a hunter and said what a shame it was that Lubotshka,\r\ncould not run as fast as Katenka, and what fun it would be if we could\r\nsee Grisha\'s chains, and so forth; but of the impending separation\r\nwe said not a word. Our chatter was interrupted by the sound of the\r\ncarriage driving up, with a village urchin perched on each of its\r\nsprings. Behind the carriage rode the huntsmen with the hounds, and\r\nthey, again, were followed by the groom Ignat on the steed intended\r\nfor Woloda, with my old horse trotting alongside. After running to\r\nthe garden fence to get a sight of all these interesting objects, and\r\nindulging in a chorus of whistling and hallooing, we rushed upstairs to\r\ndress--our one aim being to make ourselves look as like the huntsmen as\r\npossible. The obvious way to do this was to tuck one\'s breeches inside\r\none\'s boots. We lost no time over it all, for we were in a hurry to run\r\nto the entrance steps again there to feast our eyes upon the horses and\r\nhounds, and to have a chat with the huntsmen. The day was exceedingly\r\nwarm while, though clouds of fantastic shape had been gathering on the\r\nhorizon since morning and driving before a light breeze across the sun,\r\nit was clear that, for all their menacing blackness, they did not\r\nreally intend to form a thunderstorm and spoil our last day\'s pleasure.\r\nMoreover, towards afternoon some of them broke, grew pale and elongated,\r\nand sank to the horizon again, while others of them changed to the\r\nlikeness of white transparent fish-scales. In the east, over Maslovska,\r\na single lurid mass was louring, but Karl Ivanitch (who always seemed to\r\nknow the ways of the heavens) said that the weather would still continue\r\nto be fair and dry.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his advanced years, it was in quite a sprightly manner that\r\nFoka came out to the entrance steps, to give the order "Drive up."\r\nIn fact, as he planted his legs firmly apart and took up his station\r\nbetween the lowest step and the spot where the coachman was to halt,\r\nhis mien was that of a man who knew his duties and had no need to be\r\nreminded of them by anybody. Presently the ladies, also came out, and\r\nafter a little discussions as to seats and the safety of the girls (all\r\nof which seemed to me wholly superfluous), they settled themselves in\r\nthe vehicle, opened their parasols, and started. As the carriage was,\r\ndriving away, Mamma pointed to the hunter and asked nervously "Is that\r\nthe horse intended for Vladimir Petrovitch?" On the groom answering\r\nin the affirmative, she raised her hands in horror and turned her head\r\naway. As for myself, I was burning with impatience. Clambering on to\r\nthe back of my steed (I was just tall enough to see between its ears), I\r\nproceeded to perform evolutions in the courtyard.\r\n\r\n"Mind you don\'t ride over the hounds, sir," said one of the huntsmen.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue. It is not the first time I have been one of the\r\nparty." I retorted with dignity.\r\n\r\nAlthough Woloda had plenty of pluck, he was not altogether free from\r\napprehensions as he sat on the hunter. Indeed, he more than once asked\r\nas he patted it, "Is he quiet?" He looked very well on horseback--almost\r\na grown-up young man, and held himself so upright in the saddle that I\r\nenvied him since my shadow seemed to show that I could not compare with\r\nhim in looks.\r\n\r\nPresently Papa\'s footsteps sounded on the flagstones, the whip collected\r\nthe hounds, and the huntsmen mounted their steeds. Papa\'s horse came up\r\nin charge of a groom, the hounds of his particular leash sprang up from\r\ntheir picturesque attitudes to fawn upon him, and Milka, in a collar\r\nstudded with beads, came bounding joyfully from behind his heels to\r\ngreet and sport with the other dogs. Finally, as soon as Papa had\r\nmounted we rode away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII -- THE HUNT\r\n\r\nAT the head of the cavalcade rode Turka, on a hog-backed roan. On his\r\nhead he wore a shaggy cap, while, with a magnificent horn slung across\r\nhis shoulders and a knife at his belt, he looked so cruel and inexorable\r\nthat one would have thought he was going to engage in bloody strife with\r\nhis fellow men rather than to hunt a small animal. Around the hind legs\r\nof his horse the hounds gambolled like a cluster of checkered, restless\r\nballs. If one of them wished to stop, it was only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that it could do so, since not only had its leash-fellow\r\nalso to be induced to halt, but at once one of the huntsmen would wheel\r\nround, crack his whip, and shout to the delinquent,\r\n\r\n"Back to the pack, there!"\r\n\r\nArrived at a gate, Papa told us and the huntsmen to continue our way\r\nalong the road, and then rode off across a cornfield. The harvest was at\r\nits height. On the further side of a large, shining, yellow stretch of\r\ncornland lay a high purple belt of forest which always figured in my\r\neyes as a distant, mysterious region behind which either the world ended\r\nor an uninhabited waste began. This expanse of corn-land was dotted with\r\nswathes and reapers, while along the lanes where the sickle had passed\r\ncould be seen the backs of women as they stooped among the tall, thick\r\ngrain or lifted armfuls of corn and rested them against the shocks. In\r\none corner a woman was bending over a cradle, and the whole stubble was\r\nstudded with sheaves and cornflowers. In another direction shirt-sleeved\r\nmen were standing on waggons, shaking the soil from the stalks of\r\nsheaves, and stacking them for carrying. As soon as the foreman (dressed\r\nin a blouse and high boots, and carrying a tally-stick) caught sight of\r\nPapa, he hastened to take off his lamb\'s-wool cap and, wiping his red\r\nhead, told the women to get up. Papa\'s chestnut horse went trotting\r\nalong with a prancing gait as it tossed its head and swished its tail\r\nto and fro to drive away the gadflies and countless other insects which\r\ntormented its flanks, while his two greyhounds--their tails curved like\r\nsickles--went springing gracefully over the stubble. Milka was always\r\nfirst, but every now and then she would halt with a shake of her head\r\nto await the whipper-in. The chatter of the peasants; the rumbling of\r\nhorses and waggons; the joyous cries of quails; the hum of insects as\r\nthey hung suspended in the motionless air; the smell of the soil and\r\ngrain and steam from our horses; the thousand different lights and\r\nshadows which the burning sun cast upon the yellowish-white cornland;\r\nthe purple forest in the distance; the white gossamer threads which were\r\nfloating in the air or resting on the soil-all these things I observed\r\nand heard and felt to the core.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Kalinovo wood, we found the carriage awaiting us\r\nthere, with, beside it, a one-horse waggonette driven by the butler--a\r\nwaggonette in which were a tea-urn, some apparatus for making ices, and\r\nmany other attractive boxes and bundles, all packed in straw! There was\r\nno mistaking these signs, for they meant that we were going to have tea,\r\nfruit, and ices in the open air. This afforded us intense delight, since\r\nto drink tea in a wood and on the grass and where none else had ever\r\ndrunk tea before seemed to us a treat beyond expressing.\r\n\r\nWhen Turka arrived at the little clearing where the carriage was\r\nhalted he took Papa\'s detailed instructions as to how we were to divide\r\nourselves and where each of us was to go (though, as a matter of fact,\r\nhe never acted according to such instructions, but always followed his\r\nown devices). Then he unleashed the hounds, fastened the leashes to\r\nhis saddle, whistled to the pack, and disappeared among the young birch\r\ntrees the liberated hounds jumping about him in high delight, wagging\r\ntheir tails, and sniffing and gambolling with one another as they\r\ndispersed themselves in different directions.\r\n\r\n"Has anyone a pocket-handkerchief to spare?" asked Papa. I took mine\r\nfrom my pocket and offered it to him.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Fasten it to this greyhound here."\r\n\r\n"Gizana?" I asked, with the air of a connoisseur.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Then run him along the road with you. When you come to a little\r\nclearing in the wood stop and look about you, and don\'t come back to me\r\nwithout a hare."\r\n\r\nAccordingly I tied my handkerchief round Gizana\'s soft neck, and set off\r\nrunning at full speed towards the appointed spot, Papa laughing as he\r\nshouted after me, "Hurry up, hurry up or you\'ll be late!"\r\n\r\nEvery now and then Gizana kept stopping, pricking up his ears, and\r\nlistening to the hallooing of the beaters. Whenever he did this I was\r\nnot strong enough to move him, and could do no more than shout, "Come\r\non, come on!" Presently he set off so fast that I could not restrain\r\nhim, and I encountered more than one fall before we reached our\r\ndestination. Selecting there a level, shady spot near the roots of a\r\ngreat oak-tree, I lay down on the turf, made Gizana crouch beside me,\r\nand waited. As usual, my imagination far outstripped reality. I fancied\r\nthat I was pursuing at least my third hare when, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe first hound was only just giving tongue. Presently, however, Turka\'s\r\nvoice began to sound through the wood in louder and more excited tones,\r\nthe baying of a hound came nearer and nearer, and then another, and then\r\na third, and then a fourth, deep throat joined in the rising and falling\r\ncadences of a chorus, until the whole had united their voices in one\r\ncontinuous, tumultuous burst of melody. As the Russian proverb expresses\r\nit, "The forest had found a tongue, and the hounds were burning as with\r\nfire."\r\n\r\nMy excitement was so great that I nearly swooned where I stood. My lips\r\nparted themselves as though smiling, the perspiration poured from me in\r\nstreams, and, in spite of the tickling sensation caused by the drops as\r\nthey trickled over my chin, I never thought of wiping them away. I felt\r\nthat a crisis was approaching. Yet the tension was too unnatural to\r\nlast. Soon the hounds came tearing along the edge of the wood, and\r\nthen--behold, they were racing away from me again, and of hares there\r\nwas not a sign to be seen! I looked in every direction and Gizana did\r\nthe same--pulling at his leash at first and whining. Then he lay down\r\nagain by my side, rested his muzzle on my knees, and resigned himself to\r\ndisappointment. Among the naked roots of the oak-tree under which I was\r\nsitting. I could see countless ants swarming over the parched grey earth\r\nand winding among the acorns, withered oak-leaves, dry twigs, russet\r\nmoss, and slender, scanty blades of grass. In serried files they kept\r\npressing forward on the level track they had made for themselves--some\r\ncarrying burdens, some not. I took a piece of twig and barred their way.\r\nInstantly it was curious to see how they made light of the obstacle.\r\nSome got past it by creeping underneath, and some by climbing over it. A\r\nfew, however, there were (especially those weighted with loads) who were\r\nnonplussed what to do. They either halted and searched for a way round,\r\nor returned whence they had come, or climbed the adjacent herbage, with\r\nthe evident intention of reaching my hand and going up the sleeve of my\r\njacket. From this interesting spectacle my attention was distracted by\r\nthe yellow wings of a butterfly which was fluttering alluringly before\r\nme. Yet I had scarcely noticed it before it flew away to a little\r\ndistance and, circling over some half-faded blossoms of white clover,\r\nsettled on one of them. Whether it was the sun\'s warmth that delighted\r\nit, or whether it was busy sucking nectar from the flower, at all events\r\nit seemed thoroughly comfortable. It scarcely moved its wings at all,\r\nand pressed itself down into the clover until I could hardly see\r\nits body. I sat with my chin on my hands and watched it with intense\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Gizana sprang up and gave me such a violent jerk that I nearly\r\nrolled over. I looked round. At the edge of the wood a hare had just\r\ncome into view, with one ear bent down and the other one sharply\r\npricked. The blood rushed to my head, and I forgot everything else as\r\nI shouted, slipped the dog, and rushed towards the spot. Yet all was in\r\nvain. The hare stopped, made a rush, and was lost to view.\r\n\r\nHow confused I felt when at that moment Turka stepped from the\r\nundergrowth (he had been following the hounds as they ran along the\r\nedges of the wood)! He had seen my mistake (which had consisted in my\r\nnot biding my time), and now threw me a contemptuous look as he said,\r\n"Ah, master!" And you should have heard the tone in which he said it! It\r\nwould have been a relief to me if he had then and there suspended me to\r\nhis saddle instead of the hare. For a while I could only stand miserably\r\nwhere I was, without attempting to recall the dog, and ejaculate as I\r\nslapped my knees, "Good heavens! What a fool I was!" I could hear the\r\nhounds retreating into the distance, and baying along the further side\r\nof the wood as they pursued the hare, while Turka rallied them with\r\nblasts on his gorgeous horn: yet I did not stir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII -- WE PLAY GAMES\r\n\r\nTHE hunt was over, a cloth had been spread in the shade of some young\r\nbirch-trees, and the whole party was disposed around it. The butler,\r\nGabriel, had stamped down the surrounding grass, wiped the plates in\r\nreadiness, and unpacked from a basket a quantity of plums and peaches\r\nwrapped in leaves.\r\n\r\nThrough the green branches of the young birch-trees the sun glittered\r\nand threw little glancing balls of light upon the pattern of my napkin,\r\nmy legs, and the bald moist head of Gabriel. A soft breeze played in\r\nthe leaves of the trees above us, and, breathing softly upon my hair and\r\nheated face, refreshed me beyond measure. When we had finished the\r\nfruit and ices, nothing remained to be done around the empty cloth, so,\r\ndespite the oblique, scorching rays of the sun, we rose and proceeded to\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n"Well, what shall it be?" said Lubotshka, blinking in the sunlight and\r\nskipping about the grass, "Suppose we play Robinson?"\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s a tiresome game," objected Woloda, stretching himself lazily\r\non the turf and gnawing some leaves, "Always Robinson! If you want to\r\nplay at something, play at building a summerhouse."\r\n\r\nWoloda was giving himself tremendous airs. Probably he was proud of\r\nhaving ridden the hunter, and so pretended to be very tired. Perhaps,\r\nalso, he had too much hard-headedness and too little imagination\r\nfully to enjoy the game of Robinson. It was a game which consisted of\r\nperforming various scenes from The Swiss Family Robinson, a book which\r\nwe had recently been reading.\r\n\r\n"Well, but be a good boy. Why not try and please us this time?" the\r\ngirls answered. "You may be Charles or Ernest or the father, whichever\r\nyou like best," added Katenka as she tried to raise him from the ground\r\nby pulling at his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not going to; it\'s a tiresome game," said Woloda again, though\r\nsmiling as if secretly pleased.\r\n\r\n"It would be better to sit at home than not to play at ANYTHING,"\r\nmurmured Lubotshka, with tears in her eyes. She was a great weeper.\r\n\r\n"Well, go on, then. Only, DON\'T cry; I can\'t stand that sort of thing."\r\n\r\nWoloda\'s condescension did not please us much. On the contrary, his\r\nlazy, tired expression took away all the fun of the game. When we sat\r\non the ground and imagined that we were sitting in a boat and either\r\nfishing or rowing with all our might, Woloda persisted in sitting with\r\nfolded hands or in anything but a fisherman\'s posture. I made a remark\r\nabout it, but he replied that, whether we moved our hands or not, we\r\nshould neither gain nor lose ground--certainly not advance at all, and I\r\nwas forced to agree with him. Again, when I pretended to go out hunting,\r\nand, with a stick over my shoulder, set off into the wood, Woloda only\r\nlay down on his back with his hands under his head, and said that he\r\nsupposed it was all the same whether he went or not. Such behaviour and\r\nspeeches cooled our ardour for the game and were very disagreeable--the\r\nmore so since it was impossible not to confess to oneself that Woloda\r\nwas right, I myself knew that it was not only impossible to kill birds\r\nwith a stick, but to shoot at all with such a weapon. Still, it was\r\nthe game, and if we were once to begin reasoning thus, it would become\r\nequally impossible for us to go for drives on chairs. I think that even\r\nWoloda himself cannot at that moment have forgotten how, in the long\r\nwinter evenings, we had been used to cover an arm-chair with a shawl\r\nand make a carriage of it--one of us being the coachman, another one the\r\nfootman, the two girls the passengers, and three other chairs the trio\r\nof horses abreast. With what ceremony we used to set out, and with what\r\nadventures we used to meet on the way! How gaily and quickly those long\r\nwinter evenings used to pass! If we were always to judge from reality,\r\ngames would be nonsense; but if games were nonsense, what else would\r\nthere be left to do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX -- A FIRST ESSAY IN LOVE\r\n\r\nPRETENDING to gather some "American fruit" from a tree, Lubotshka\r\nsuddenly plucked a leaf upon which was a huge caterpillar, and throwing\r\nthe insect with horror to the ground, lifted her hands and sprang away\r\nas though afraid it would spit at her. The game stopped, and we crowded\r\nour heads together as we stooped to look at the curiosity.\r\n\r\nI peeped over Katenka\'s shoulder as she was trying to lift the\r\ncaterpillar by placing another leaf in its way. I had observed before\r\nthat the girls had a way of shrugging their shoulders whenever they were\r\ntrying to put a loose garment straight on their bare necks, as well as\r\nthat Mimi always grew angry on witnessing this manoeuvre and declared\r\nit to be a chambermaid\'s trick. As Katenka bent over the caterpillar she\r\nmade that very movement, while at the same instant the breeze lifted the\r\nfichu on her white neck. Her shoulder was close to my lips, I looked at\r\nit and kissed it. She did not turn round, but Woloda remarked without\r\nraising his head, "What spooniness!" I felt the tears rising to my eyes,\r\nand could not take my gaze from Katenka. I had long been used to her\r\nfair, fresh face, and had always been fond of her, but now I looked at\r\nher more closely, and felt more fond of her, than I had ever done or\r\nfelt before.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the grown-ups, Papa informed us, to our great joy,\r\nthat, at Mamma\'s entreaties, our departure was to be postponed until\r\nthe following morning. We rode home beside the carriage--Woloda and\r\nI galloping near it, and vieing with one another in our exhibition of\r\nhorsemanship and daring. My shadow looked longer now than it had done\r\nbefore, and from that I judged that I had grown into a fine rider. Yet\r\nmy complacency was soon marred by an unfortunate occurrence. Desiring\r\nto outdo Woloda before the audience in the carriage, I dropped a little\r\nbehind. Then with whip and spur I urged my steed forward, and at the\r\nsame time assumed a natural, graceful attitude, with the intention of\r\nwhooting past the carriage on the side on which Katenka was seated. My\r\nonly doubt was whether to halloo or not as I did so. In the event, my\r\ninfernal horse stopped so abruptly when just level with the carriage\r\nhorses that I was pitched forward on to its neck and cut a very sorry\r\nfigure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX -- THE SORT OF MAN MY FATHER WAS\r\n\r\nPapa was a gentleman of the last century, with all the chivalrous\r\ncharacter, self-reliance, and gallantry of the youth of that time. Upon\r\nthe men of the present day he looked with a contempt arising partly from\r\ninborn pride and partly from a secret feeling of vexation that, in this\r\nage of ours, he could no longer enjoy the influence and success which\r\nhad been his in his youth. His two principal failings were gambling and\r\ngallantry, and he had won or lost, in the course of his career, several\r\nmillions of roubles.\r\n\r\nTall and of imposing figure, he walked with a curiously quick, mincing\r\ngait, as well as had a habit of hitching one of his shoulders. His eyes\r\nwere small and perpetually twinkling, his nose large and aquiline, his\r\nlips irregular and rather oddly (though pleasantly) compressed, his\r\narticulation slightly defective and lisping, and his head quite bald.\r\nSuch was my father\'s exterior from the days of my earliest recollection.\r\nIt was an exterior which not only brought him success and made him a\r\nman a bonnes fortunes but one which pleased people of all ranks and\r\nstations. Especially did it please those whom he desired to please.\r\n\r\nAt all junctures he knew how to take the lead, for, though not deriving\r\nfrom the highest circles of society, he had always mixed with them, and\r\nknew how to win their respect. He possessed in the highest degree that\r\nmeasure of pride and self-confidence which, without giving offence,\r\nmaintains a man in the opinion of the world. He had much originality,\r\nas well as the ability to use it in such a way that it benefited him as\r\nmuch as actual worldly position or fortune could have done. Nothing in\r\nthe universe could surprise him, and though not of eminent attainments\r\nin life, he seemed born to have acquired them. He understood so\r\nperfectly how to make both himself and others forget and keep at\r\na distance the seamy side of life, with all its petty troubles\r\nand vicissitudes, that it was impossible not to envy him. He was a\r\nconnoisseur in everything which could give ease and pleasure, as well\r\nas knew how to make use of such knowledge. Likewise he prided himself on\r\nthe brilliant connections which he had formed through my mother\'s family\r\nor through friends of his youth, and was secretly jealous of any one of\r\na higher rank than himself--any one, that is to say, of a rank higher\r\nthan a retired lieutenant of the Guards. Moreover, like all ex-officers,\r\nhe refused to dress himself in the prevailing fashion, though he attired\r\nhimself both originally and artistically--his invariable wear being\r\nlight, loose-fitting suits, very fine shirts, and large collars and\r\ncuffs. Everything seemed to suit his upright figure and quiet, assured\r\nair. He was sensitive to the pitch of sentimentality, and, when reading\r\na pathetic passage, his voice would begin to tremble and the tears to\r\ncome into his eyes, until he had to lay the book aside. Likewise he was\r\nfond of music, and could accompany himself on the piano as he sang the\r\nlove songs of his friend A-- or gipsy songs or themes from operas;\r\nbut he had no love for serious music, and would frankly flout received\r\nopinion by declaring that, whereas Beethoven\'s sonatas wearied him and\r\nsent him to sleep, his ideal of beauty was "Do not wake me, youth"\r\nas Semenoff sang it, or "Not one" as the gipsy Taninsha rendered that\r\nditty. His nature was essentially one of those which follow public\r\nopinion concerning what is good, and consider only that good which the\r\npublic declares to be so. [It may be noted that the author has said\r\nearlier in the chapter that his father possessed "much originality."]\r\nGod only knows whether he had any moral convictions. His life was so\r\nfull of amusement that probably he never had time to form any, and was\r\ntoo successful ever to feel the lack of them.\r\n\r\nAs he grew to old age he looked at things always from a fixed point\r\nof view, and cultivated fixed rules--but only so long as that point or\r\nthose rules coincided with expediency. The mode of life which offered\r\nsome passing degree of interest--that, in his opinion, was the right\r\none and the only one that men ought to affect. He had great fluency of\r\nargument; and this, I think, increased the adaptability of his morals\r\nand enabled him to speak of one and the same act, now as good, and now,\r\nwith abuse, as abominable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI -- IN THE DRAWING-ROOM AND THE STUDY\r\n\r\nTwilight had set in when we reached home. Mamma sat down to the piano,\r\nand we to a table, there to paint and draw in colours and pencil. Though\r\nI had only one cake of colour, and it was blue, I determined to draw a\r\npicture of the hunt. In exceedingly vivid fashion I painted a blue boy\r\non a blue horse, and--but here I stopped, for I was uncertain whether\r\nit was possible also to paint a blue HARE. I ran to the study to consult\r\nPapa, and as he was busy reading he never lifted his eyes from his book\r\nwhen I asked, "Can there be blue hares?" but at once replied, "There\r\ncan, my boy, there can." Returning to the table I painted in my blue\r\nhare, but subsequently thought it better to change it into a blue bush.\r\nYet the blue bush did not wholly please me, so I changed it into a tree,\r\nand then into a rick, until, the whole paper having now become one blur\r\nof blue, I tore it angrily in pieces, and went off to meditate in the\r\nlarge arm-chair.\r\n\r\nMamma was playing Field\'s second concerto. Field, it may be said, had\r\nbeen her master. As I dozed, the music brought up before my imagination\r\na kind of luminosity, with transparent dream-shapes. Next she played the\r\n"Sonate Pathetique" of Beethoven, and I at once felt heavy, depressed,\r\nand apprehensive. Mamma often played those two pieces, and therefore I\r\nwell recollect the feelings they awakened in me. Those feelings were a\r\nreminiscence--of what? Somehow I seemed to remember something which had\r\nnever been.\r\n\r\nOpposite to me lay the study door, and presently I saw Jakoff enter it,\r\naccompanied by several long-bearded men in kaftans. Then the door shut\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"Now they are going to begin some business or other," I thought. I\r\nbelieved the affairs transacted in that study to be the most important\r\nones on earth. This opinion was confirmed by the fact that people only\r\napproached the door of that room on tiptoe and speaking in whispers.\r\nPresently Papa\'s resonant voice sounded within, and I also scented\r\ncigar smoke--always a very attractive thing to me. Next, as I dozed, I\r\nsuddenly heard a creaking of boots that I knew, and, sure enough,\r\nsaw Karl Ivanitch go on tiptoe, and with a depressed, but resolute,\r\nexpression on his face and a written document in his hand, to the study\r\ndoor and knock softly. It opened, and then shut again behind him.\r\n\r\n"I hope nothing is going to happen," I mused. "Karl Ivanitch is\r\noffended, and might be capable of anything--" and again I dozed off.\r\n\r\nNevertheless something DID happen. An hour later I was disturbed by\r\nthe same creaking of boots, and saw Karl come out, and disappear up\r\nthe stairs, wiping away a few tears from his cheeks with his pocket\r\nhandkerchief as he went and muttering something between his teeth. Papa\r\ncame out behind him and turned aside into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I have just decided to do?" he asked gaily as he laid\r\na hand upon Mamma\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"What, my love?"\r\n\r\n"To take Karl Ivanitch with the children. There will be room enough for\r\nhim in the carriage. They are used to him, and he seems greatly attached\r\nto them. Seven hundred roubles a year cannot make much difference to us,\r\nand the poor devil is not at all a bad sort of a fellow." I could not\r\nunderstand why Papa should speak of him so disrespectfully.\r\n\r\n"I am delighted," said Mamma, "and as much for the children\'s sake as\r\nhis own. He is a worthy old man."\r\n\r\n"I wish you could have seen how moved he was when I told him that he\r\nmight look upon the 500 roubles as a present! But the most amusing thing\r\nof all is this bill which he has just handed me. It is worth\r\nseeing," and with a smile Papa gave Mamma a paper inscribed in Karl\'s\r\nhandwriting. "Is it not capital?" he concluded.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the paper were as follows: [The joke of this bill\r\nconsists chiefly in its being written in very bad Russian, with\r\ncontinual mistakes as to plural and singular, prepositions and so\r\nforth.]\r\n\r\n"Two book for the children--70 copeck. Coloured paper, gold frames, and\r\na pop-guns, blockheads [This word has a double meaning in Russian.] for\r\ncutting out several box for presents--6 roubles, 55 copecks. Several\r\nbook and a bows, presents for the childrens--8 roubles, 16 copecks. A\r\ngold watches promised to me by Peter Alexandrovitch out of Moscow, in\r\nthe years 18-- for 140 roubles. Consequently Karl Mayer have to receive\r\n139 rouble, 79 copecks, beside his wage."\r\n\r\nIf people were to judge only by this bill (in which Karl Ivanitch\r\ndemanded repayment of all the money he had spent on presents, as well as\r\nthe value of a present promised to himself), they would take him to have\r\nbeen a callous, avaricious egotist yet they would be wrong.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he had entered the study with the paper in his hand and\r\na set speech in his head, for the purpose of declaiming eloquently to\r\nPapa on the subject of the wrongs which he believed himself to have\r\nsuffered in our house, but that, as soon as ever he began to speak in\r\nthe vibratory voice and with the expressive intonations which he used in\r\ndictating to us, his eloquence wrought upon himself more than upon Papa;\r\nwith the result that, when he came to the point where he had to say,\r\n"however sad it will be for me to part with the children," he lost his\r\nself-command utterly, his articulation became choked, and he was obliged\r\nto draw his coloured pocket-handkerchief from his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Peter Alexandrovitch," he said, weeping (this formed no part of\r\nthe prepared speech), "I am grown so used to the children that I cannot\r\nthink what I should do without them. I would rather serve you without\r\nsalary than not at all," and with one hand he wiped his eyes, while with\r\nthe other he presented the bill.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am convinced that at that moment Karl Ivanitch was speaking\r\nwith absolute sincerity (for I know how good his heart was), I confess\r\nthat never to this day have I been able quite to reconcile his words\r\nwith the bill.\r\n\r\n"Well, if the idea of leaving us grieves you, you may be sure that the\r\nidea of dismissing you grieves me equally," said Papa, tapping him on\r\nthe shoulder. Then, after a pause, he added, "But I have changed my\r\nmind, and you shall not leave us."\r\n\r\nJust before supper Grisha entered the room. Ever since he had entered\r\nthe house that day he had never ceased to sigh and weep--a portent,\r\naccording to those who believed in his prophetic powers, that misfortune\r\nwas impending for the household. He had now come to take leave of us,\r\nfor to-morrow (so he said) he must be moving on. I nudged Woloda, and we\r\nmoved towards the door.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" he said.\r\n\r\n"This--that if we want to see Grisha\'s chains we must go upstairs at\r\nonce to the men-servants\' rooms. Grisha is to sleep in the second one,\r\nso we can sit in the store-room and see everything."\r\n\r\n"All right. Wait here, and I\'ll tell the girls."\r\n\r\nThe girls came at once, and we ascended the stairs, though the question\r\nas to which of us should first enter the store-room gave us some little\r\ntrouble. Then we cowered down and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII -- GRISHA\r\n\r\nWE all felt a little uneasy in the thick darkness, so we pressed close\r\nto one another and said nothing. Before long Grisha arrived with his\r\nsoft tread, carrying in one hand his staff and in the other a tallow\r\ncandle set in a brass candlestick. We scarcely ventured to breathe.\r\n\r\n"Our Lord Jesus Christ! Holy Mother of God! Father, Son, and Holy\r\nGhost!" he kept repeating, with the different intonations and\r\nabbreviations which gradually become peculiar to persons who are\r\naccustomed to pronounce the words with great frequency.\r\n\r\nStill praying, he placed his staff in a corner and looked at the bed;\r\nafter which he began to undress. Unfastening his old black girdle, he\r\nslowly divested himself of his torn nankeen kaftan, and deposited\r\nit carefully on the back of a chair. His face had now lost its usual\r\ndisquietude and idiocy. On the contrary, it had in it something restful,\r\nthoughtful, and even grand, while all his movements were deliberate and\r\nintelligent.\r\n\r\nNext, he lay down quietly in his shirt on the bed, made the sign of the\r\ncross towards every side of him, and adjusted his chains beneath his\r\nshirt--an operation which, as we could see from his face, occasioned him\r\nconsiderable pain. Then he sat up again, looked gravely at his ragged\r\nshirt, and rising and taking the candle, lifted the latter towards the\r\nshrine where the images of the saints stood. That done, he made the sign\r\nof the cross again, and turned the candle upside down, when it went out\r\nwith a hissing noise.\r\n\r\nThrough the window (which overlooked the wood) the moon (nearly full)\r\nwas shining in such a way that one side of the tall white figure of the\r\nidiot stood out in the pale, silvery moonlight, while the other side was\r\nlost in the dark shadow which covered the floor, walls, and ceiling. In\r\nthe courtyard the watchman was tapping at intervals upon his brass alarm\r\nplate. For a while Grisha stood silently before the images and, with\r\nhis large hands pressed to his breast and his head bent forward, gave\r\noccasional sighs. Then with difficulty he knelt down and began to pray.\r\n\r\nAt first he repeated some well-known prayers, and only accented a word\r\nhere and there. Next, he repeated thee same prayers, but louder and\r\nwith increased accentuation. Lastly he repeated them again and with even\r\ngreater emphasis, as well as with an evident effort to pronounce them in\r\nthe old Slavonic Church dialect. Though disconnected, his prayers were\r\nvery touching. He prayed for all his benefactors (so he called every one\r\nwho had received him hospitably), with, among them, Mamma and ourselves.\r\nNext he prayed for himself, and besought God to forgive him his sins,\r\nat the same time repeating, "God forgive also my enemies!" Then, moaning\r\nwith the effort, he rose from his knees--only to fall to the floor again\r\nand repeat his phrases afresh. At last he regained his feet, despite\r\nthe weight of the chains, which rattled loudly whenever they struck the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nWoloda pinched me rudely in the leg, but I took no notice of that\r\n(except that I involuntarily touched the place with my hand), as I\r\nobserved with a feeling of childish astonishment, pity, and respect\r\nthe words and gestures of Grisha. Instead of the laughter and amusement\r\nwhich I had expected on entering the store-room, I felt my heart beating\r\nand overcome.\r\n\r\nGrisha continued for some time in this state of religious ecstasy as he\r\nimprovised prayers and repeated again and yet again, "Lord, have mercy\r\nupon me!" Each time that he said, "Pardon me, Lord, and teach me to\r\ndo what Thou wouldst have done," he pronounced the words with added\r\nearnestness and emphasis, as though he expected an immediate answer to\r\nhis petition, and then fell to sobbing and moaning once more. Finally,\r\nhe went down on his knees again, folded his arms upon his breast, and\r\nremained silent. I ventured to put my head round the door (holding my\r\nbreath as I did so), but Grisha still made no movement except for the\r\nheavy sighs which heaved his breast. In the moonlight I could see a tear\r\nglistening on the white patch of his blind eye.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Thy will be done!" he exclaimed suddenly, with an expression which\r\nI cannot describe, as, prostrating himself with his forehead on the\r\nfloor, he fell to sobbing like a child.\r\n\r\nMuch sand has run out since then, many recollections of the past have\r\nfaded from my memory or become blurred in indistinct visions, and poor\r\nGrisha himself has long since reached the end of his pilgrimage; but the\r\nimpression which he produced upon me, and the feelings which he aroused\r\nin my breast, will never leave my mind. O truly Christian Grisha, your\r\nfaith was so strong that you could feel the actual presence of God; your\r\nlove so great that the words fell of themselves from your lips. You had\r\nno reason to prove them, for you did so with your earnest praises of His\r\nmajesty as you fell to the ground speechless and in tears!\r\n\r\nNevertheless the sense of awe with which I had listened to Grisha could\r\nnot last for ever. I had now satisfied my curiosity, and, being cramped\r\nwith sitting in one position so long, desired to join in the tittering\r\nand fun which I could hear going on in the dark store-room behind me.\r\nSome one took my hand and whispered, "Whose hand is this?" Despite the\r\ndarkness, I knew by the touch and the low voice in my ear that it was\r\nKatenka. I took her by the arm, but she withdrew it, and, in doing so,\r\npushed a cane chair which was standing near. Grisha lifted his head\r\nlooked quietly about him, and, muttering a prayer, rose and made the\r\nsign of the cross towards each of the four corners of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII -- NATALIA SAVISHNA\r\n\r\nIn days gone by there used to run about the seignorial courtyard of the\r\ncountry-house at Chabarovska a girl called Natashka. She always wore a\r\ncotton dress, went barefooted, and was rosy, plump, and gay. It was at\r\nthe request and entreaties of her father, the clarionet player Savi,\r\nthat my grandfather had "taken her upstairs"--that is to say, made\r\nher one of his wife\'s female servants. As chamber-maid, Natashka so\r\ndistinguished herself by her zeal and amiable temper that when Mamma\r\narrived as a baby and required a nurse Natashka was honoured with the\r\ncharge of her. In this new office the girl earned still further praises\r\nand rewards for her activity, trustworthiness, and devotion to her young\r\nmistress. Soon, however, the powdered head and buckled shoes of the\r\nyoung and active footman Foka (who had frequent opportunities of\r\ncourting her, since they were in the same service) captivated her\r\nunsophisticated, but loving, heart. At last she ventured to go and ask\r\nmy grandfather if she might marry Foka, but her master took the request\r\nin bad part, flew into a passion, and punished poor Natashka by exiling\r\nher to a farm which he owned in a remote quarter of the Steppes. At\r\nlength, when she had been gone six months and nobody could be found to\r\nreplace her, she was recalled to her former duties. Returned, and with\r\nher dress in rags, she fell at Grandpapa\'s feet, and besought him to\r\nrestore her his favour and kindness, and to forget the folly of which\r\nshe had been guilty--folly which, she assured him, should never recur\r\nagain. And she kept her word.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forth she called herself, not Natashka, but Natalia\r\nSavishna, and took to wearing a cap. All the love in her heart was now\r\nbestowed upon her young charge. When Mamma had a governess appointed\r\nfor her education, Natalia was awarded the keys as housekeeper, and\r\nhenceforth had the linen and provisions under her care. These new duties\r\nshe fulfilled with equal fidelity and zeal. She lived only for her\r\nmaster\'s advantage. Everything in which she could detect fraud,\r\nextravagance, or waste she endeavoured to remedy to the best of her\r\npower. When Mamma married and wished in some way to reward Natalia\r\nSavishna for her twenty years of care and labour, she sent for her and,\r\nvoicing in the tenderest terms her attachment and love, presented\r\nher with a stamped charter of her (Natalia\'s) freedom, [It will be\r\nremembered that this was in the days of serfdom] telling her at the same\r\ntime that, whether she continued to serve in the household or not, she\r\nshould always receive an annual pension of 300 roubles. Natalia listened\r\nin silence to this. Then, taking the document in her hands and regarding\r\nit with a frown, she muttered something between her teeth, and darted\r\nfrom the room, slamming the door behind her. Not understanding the\r\nreason for such strange conduct, Mamma followed her presently to her\r\nroom, and found her sitting with streaming eyes on her trunk, crushing\r\nher pocket-handkerchief between her fingers, and looking mournfully\r\nat the remains of the document, which was lying torn to pieces on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, dear Natalia Savishna?" said Mamma, taking her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, ma\'am," she replied; "only--only I must have displeased you\r\nsomehow, since you wish to dismiss me from the house. Well, I will go."\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand and, with difficulty restraining her tears, rose\r\nto leave the room, but Mamma stopped her, and they wept a while in one\r\nanother\'s arms.\r\n\r\nEver since I can remember anything I can remember Natalia Savishna and\r\nher love and tenderness; yet only now have I learnt to appreciate them\r\nat their full value. In early days it never occurred to me to think what\r\na rare and wonderful being this old domestic was. Not only did she never\r\ntalk, but she seemed never even to think, of herself. Her whole life\r\nwas compounded of love and self-sacrifice. Yet so used was I to her\r\naffection and singleness of heart that I could not picture things\r\notherwise. I never thought of thanking her, or of asking myself, "Is she\r\nalso happy? Is she also contented?" Often on some pretext or another I\r\nwould leave my lessons and run to her room, where, sitting down, I\r\nwould begin to muse aloud as though she were not there. She was forever\r\nmending something, or tidying the shelves which lined her room,\r\nor marking linen, so that she took no heed of the nonsense which I\r\ntalked--how that I meant to become a general, to marry a beautiful\r\nwoman, to buy a chestnut horse, to, build myself a house of glass, to\r\ninvite Karl Ivanitch\'s relatives to come and visit me from Saxony, and\r\nso forth; to all of which she would only reply, "Yes, my love, yes."\r\nThen, on my rising, and preparing to go, she would open a blue trunk\r\nwhich had pasted on the inside of its lid a coloured picture of a hussar\r\nwhich had once adorned a pomade bottle and a sketch made by Woloda, and\r\ntake from it a fumigation pastille, which she would light and shake for\r\nmy benefit, saying:\r\n\r\n"These, dear, are the pastilles which your grandfather (now in Heaven)\r\nbrought back from Otchakov after fighting against the Turks." Then she\r\nwould add with a sigh: "But this is nearly the last one."\r\n\r\nThe trunks which filled her room seemed to contain almost everything in\r\nthe world. Whenever anything was wanted, people said, "Oh, go and ask\r\nNatalia Savishna for it," and, sure enough, it was seldom that she did\r\nnot produce the object required and say, "See what comes of taking care\r\nof everything!" Her trunks contained thousands of things which nobody in\r\nthe house but herself would have thought of preserving.\r\n\r\nOnce I lost my temper with her. This was how it happened.\r\n\r\nOne day after luncheon I poured myself out a glass of kvass, and then\r\ndropped the decanter, and so stained the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n"Go and call Natalia, that she may come and see what her darling has\r\ndone," said Mamma.\r\n\r\nNatalia arrived, and shook her head at me when she saw the damage I had\r\ndone; but Mamma whispered something in her car, threw a look at myself,\r\nand then left the room.\r\n\r\nI was just skipping away, in the sprightliest mood possible, when\r\nNatalia darted out upon me from behind the door with the tablecloth in\r\nher hand, and, catching hold of me, rubbed my face hard with the stained\r\npart of it, repeating, "Don\'t thou go and spoil tablecloths any more!"\r\n\r\nI struggled hard, and roared with temper.\r\n\r\n"What?" I said to myself as I fled to the drawing-room in a mist of\r\ntears, "To think that Natalia Savishna-just plain Natalia-should say\r\n\'THOU\' to me and rub my face with a wet tablecloth as though I were a\r\nmere servant-boy! It is abominable!"\r\n\r\nSeeing my fury, Natalia departed, while I continued to strut about and\r\nplan how to punish the bold woman for her offence. Yet not more than a\r\nfew moments had passed when Natalia returned and, stealing to my side,\r\nbegan to comfort me,\r\n\r\n"Hush, then, my love. Do not cry. Forgive me my rudeness. It was wrong\r\nof me. You WILL pardon me, my darling, will you not? There, there,\r\nthat\'s a dear," and she took from her handkerchief a cornet of pink\r\npaper containing two little cakes and a grape, and offered it me with\r\na trembling hand. I could not look the kind old woman in the face, but,\r\nturning aside, took the paper, while my tears flowed the faster--though\r\nfrom love and shame now, not from anger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV -- THE PARTING\r\n\r\nON the day after the events described, the carriage and the luggage-cart\r\ndrew up to the door at noon. Nicola, dressed for the journey, with his\r\nbreeches tucked into his boots and an old overcoat belted tightly about\r\nhim with a girdle, got into the cart and arranged cloaks and cushions on\r\nthe seats. When he thought that they were piled high enough he sat down\r\non them, but finding them still unsatisfactory, jumped up and arranged\r\nthem once more.\r\n\r\n"Nicola Dimitvitch, would you be so good as to take master\'s\r\ndressing-case with you?" said Papa\'s valet, suddenly standing up in the\r\ncarriage, "It won\'t take up much room."\r\n\r\n"You should have told me before, Michael Ivanitch," answered Nicola\r\nsnappishly as he hurled a bundle with all his might to the floor of the\r\ncart. "Good gracious! Why, when my head is going round like a whirlpool,\r\nthere you come along with your dressing-case!" and he lifted his cap to\r\nwipe away the drops of perspiration from his sunburnt brow.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard was full of bareheaded peasants in kaftans or simple\r\nshirts, women clad in the national dress and wearing striped\r\nhandkerchiefs, and barefooted little ones--the latter holding their\r\nmothers\' hands or crowding round the entrance-steps. All were chattering\r\namong themselves as they stared at the carriage. One of the postillions,\r\nan old man dressed in a winter cap and cloak, took hold of the pole of\r\nthe carriage and tried it carefully, while the other postillion (a\r\nyoung man in a white blouse with pink gussets on the sleeves and a black\r\nlamb\'s-wool cap which he kept cocking first on one side and then on the\r\nother as he arranged his flaxen hair) laid his overcoat upon the box,\r\nslung the reins over it, and cracked his thonged whip as he looked now\r\nat his boots and now at the other drivers where they stood greasing the\r\nwheels of the cart--one driver lifting up each wheel in turn and the\r\nother driver applying the grease. Tired post-horses of various hues\r\nstood lashing away flies with their tails near the gate--some stamping\r\ntheir great hairy legs, blinking their eyes, and dozing, some leaning\r\nwearily against their neighbours, and others cropping the leaves and\r\nstalks of dark-green fern which grew near the entrance-steps. Some of\r\nthe dogs were lying panting in the sun, while others were slinking under\r\nthe vehicles to lick the grease from the wheels. The air was filled with\r\na sort of dusty mist, and the horizon was lilac-grey in colour, though\r\nno clouds were to be seen, A strong wind from the south was raising\r\nvolumes of dust from the roads and fields, shaking the poplars and\r\nbirch-trees in the garden, and whirling their yellow leaves away. I\r\nmyself was sitting at a window and waiting impatiently for these various\r\npreparations to come to an end.\r\n\r\nAs we sat together by the drawing-room table, to pass the last few\r\nmoments en famille, it never occurred to me that a sad moment was\r\nimpending. On the contrary, the most trivial thoughts were filling my\r\nbrain. Which driver was going to drive the carriage and which the cart?\r\nWhich of us would sit with Papa, and which with Karl Ivanitch? Why must\r\nI be kept forever muffled up in a scarf and padded boots?\r\n\r\n"Am I so delicate? Am I likely to be frozen?" I thought to myself.\r\n"I wish it would all come to an end, and we could take our seats and\r\nstart."\r\n\r\n"To whom shall I give the list of the children\'s linen?" asked Natalia\r\nSavishna of Mamma as she entered the room with a paper in her hand and\r\nher eyes red with weeping.\r\n\r\n"Give it to Nicola, and then return to say good-bye to them," replied\r\nMamma. The old woman seemed about to say something more, but suddenly\r\nstopped short, covered her face with her handkerchief, and left the\r\nroom. Something seemed to prick at my heart when I saw that gesture of\r\nhers, but impatience to be off soon drowned all other feeling, and\r\nI continued to listen indifferently to Papa and Mamma as they talked\r\ntogether. They were discussing subjects which evidently interested\r\nneither of them. What must be bought for the house? What would Princess\r\nSophia or Madame Julie say? Would the roads be good?--and so forth.\r\n\r\nFoka entered, and in the same tone and with the same air as though he\r\nwere announcing luncheon said, "The carriages are ready." I saw Mamma\r\ntremble and turn pale at the announcement, just as though it were\r\nsomething unexpected.\r\n\r\nNext, Foka was ordered to shut all the doors of the room. This amused\r\nme highly. As though we needed to be concealed from some one! When\r\nevery one else was seated, Foka took the last remaining chair. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, had he done so when the door creaked and every one looked that\r\nway. Natalia Savishna entered hastily, and, without raising her eyes,\r\nsat own on the same chair as Foka. I can see them before me now-Foka\'s\r\nbald head and wrinkled, set face, and, beside him, a bent, kind figure\r\nin a cap from beneath which a few grey hairs were straggling. The pair\r\nsettled themselves together on the chair, but neither of them looked\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI continued preoccupied and impatient. In fact, the ten minutes during\r\nwhich we sat there with closed doors seemed to me an hour. At last every\r\none rose, made the sign of the cross, and began to say good-bye. Papa\r\nembraced Mamma, and kissed her again and again.\r\n\r\n"But enough," he said presently. "We are not parting for ever."\r\n\r\n"No, but it is-so-so sad!" replied Mamma, her voice trembling with\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard that faltering voice, and saw those quivering lips and\r\ntear-filled eyes, I forgot everything else in the world. I felt so ill\r\nand miserable that I would gladly have run away rather than bid\r\nher farewell. I felt, too, that when she was embracing Papa she was\r\nembracing us all. She clasped Woloda to her several times, and made the\r\nsign of the cross over him; after which I approached her, thinking that\r\nit was my turn. Nevertheless she took him again and again to her heart,\r\nand blessed him. Finally I caught hold of her, and, clinging to her,\r\nwept--wept, thinking of nothing in the world but my grief.\r\n\r\nAs we passed out to take our seats, other servants pressed round us in\r\nthe hall to say good-bye. Yet their requests to shake hands with\r\nus, their resounding kisses on our shoulders, [The fashion in which\r\ninferiors salute their superiors in Russia.] and the odour of their\r\ngreasy heads only excited in me a feeling akin to impatience with these\r\ntiresome people. The same feeling made me bestow nothing more than a\r\nvery cross kiss upon Natalia\'s cap when she approached to take leave of\r\nme. It is strange that I should still retain a perfect recollection of\r\nthese servants\' faces, and be able to draw them with the most minute\r\naccuracy in my mind, while Mamma\'s face and attitude escape me entirely.\r\nIt may be that it is because at that moment I had not the heart to look\r\nat her closely. I felt that if I did so our mutual grief would burst\r\nforth too unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\nI was the first to jump into the carriage and to take one of the hinder\r\nseats. The high back of the carriage prevented me from actually seeing\r\nher, yet I knew by instinct that Mamma was still there.\r\n\r\n"Shall I look at her again or not?" I said to myself. "Well, just for\r\nthe last time," and I peeped out towards the entrance-steps. Exactly at\r\nthat moment Mamma moved by the same impulse, came to the opposite side\r\nof the carriage, and called me by name. Hearing her voice behind me. I\r\nturned round, but so hastily that our heads knocked together. She gave a\r\nsad smile, and kissed me convulsively for the last time.\r\n\r\nWhen we had driven away a few paces I determined to look at her once\r\nmore. The wind was lifting the blue handkerchief from her head as, bent\r\nforward and her face buried in her hands, she moved slowly up the steps.\r\nFoka was supporting her. Papa said nothing as he sat beside me. I felt\r\nbreathless with tears--felt a sensation in my throat as though I were\r\ngoing to choke, just as we came out on to the open road I saw a white\r\nhandkerchief waving from the terrace. I waved mine in return, and the\r\naction of so doing calmed me a little. I still went on crying, but the\r\nthought that my tears were a proof of my affection helped to soothe and\r\ncomfort me.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while I began to recover, and to look with interest at\r\nobjects which we passed and at the hind-quarters of the led horse which\r\nwas trotting on my side. I watched how it would swish its tail, how it\r\nwould lift one hoof after the other, how the driver\'s thong would fall\r\nupon its back, and how all its legs would then seem to jump together and\r\nthe back-band, with the rings on it, to jump too--the whole covered with\r\nthe horse\'s foam. Then I would look at the rolling stretches of ripe\r\ncorn, at the dark ploughed fields where ploughs and peasants and horses\r\nwith foals were working, at their footprints, and at the box of the\r\ncarriage to see who was driving us; until, though my face was still wet\r\nwith tears, my thoughts had strayed far from her with whom I had just\r\nparted--parted, perhaps, for ever. Yet ever and again something would\r\nrecall her to my memory. I remembered too how, the evening before, I\r\nhad found a mushroom under the birch-trees, how Lubotshka had quarrelled\r\nwith Katenka as to whose it should be, and how they had both of them\r\nwept when taking leave of us. I felt sorry to be parted from them, and\r\nfrom Natalia Savishna, and from the birch-tree avenue, and from Foka.\r\nYes, even the horrid Mimi I longed for. I longed for everything at home.\r\nAnd poor Mamma!--The tears rushed to my eyes again. Yet even this mood\r\npassed away before long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV -- CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\nHAPPY, happy, never-returning time of childhood! How can we help loving\r\nand dwelling upon its recollections? They cheer and elevate the soul,\r\nand become to one a source of higher joys.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when dreaming of bygone days, I fancy that, tired out with\r\nrunning about, I have sat down, as of old, in my high arm-chair by the\r\ntea-table. It is late, and I have long since drunk my cup of milk. My\r\neyes are heavy with sleep as I sit there and listen. How could I not\r\nlisten, seeing that Mamma is speaking to somebody, and that the sound\r\nof her voice is so melodious and kind? How much its echoes recall to\r\nmy heart! With my eyes veiled with drowsiness I gaze at her wistfully.\r\nSuddenly she seems to grow smaller and smaller, and her face vanishes\r\nto a point; yet I can still see it--can still see her as she looks at me\r\nand smiles. Somehow it pleases me to see her grown so small. I blink and\r\nblink, yet she looks no larger than a boy reflected in the pupil of an\r\neye. Then I rouse myself, and the picture fades. Once more I half-close\r\nmy eyes, and cast about to try and recall the dream, but it has gone.\r\n\r\nI rise to my feet, only to fall back comfortably into the armchair.\r\n\r\n"There! You are failing asleep again, little Nicolas," says Mamma. "You\r\nhad better go to by-by."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t go to sleep, Mamma," I reply, though almost inaudibly, for\r\npleasant dreams are filling all my soul. The sound sleep of childhood is\r\nweighing my eyelids down, and for a few moments I sink into slumber and\r\noblivion until awakened by some one. I feel in my sleep as though a\r\nsoft hand were caressing me. I know it by the touch, and, though still\r\ndreaming, I seize hold of it and press it to my lips. Every one else has\r\ngone to bed, and only one candle remains burning in the drawing-room.\r\nMamma has said that she herself will wake me. She sits down on the arm\r\nof the chair in which I am asleep, with her soft hand stroking my hair,\r\nand I hear her beloved, well-known voice say in my ear:\r\n\r\n"Get up, my darling. It is time to go by-by."\r\n\r\nNo envious gaze sees her now. She is not afraid to shed upon me the\r\nwhole of her tenderness and love. I do not wake up, yet I kiss and kiss\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Get up, then, my angel."\r\n\r\nShe passes her other arm round my neck, and her fingers tickle me as\r\nthey move across it. The room is quiet and in half-darkness, but the\r\ntickling has touched my nerves and I begin to awake. Mamma is sitting\r\nnear me--that I can tell--and touching me; I can hear her voice and\r\nfeel her presence. This at last rouses me to spring up, to throw my arms\r\naround her neck, to hide my head in her bosom, and to say with a sigh:\r\n\r\n"Ah, dear, darling Mamma, how much I love you!"\r\n\r\nShe smiles her sad, enchanting smile, takes my head between her two\r\nhands, kisses me on the forehead, and lifts me on to her lap.\r\n\r\n"Do you love me so much, then?" she says. Then, after a few moments\'\r\nsilence, she continues: "And you must love me always, and never forget\r\nme. If your Mamma should no longer be here, will you promise never to\r\nforget her--never, Nicolinka? and she kisses me more fondly than ever.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you must not speak so, darling Mamma, my own darling Mamma!"\r\nI exclaim as I clasp her knees, and tears of joy and love fall from my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHow, after scenes like this, I would go upstairs, and stand before the\r\nikons, and say with a rapturous feeling, "God bless Papa and Mamma!" and\r\nrepeat a prayer for my beloved mother which my childish lips had learnt\r\nto lisp-the love of God and of her blending strangely in a single\r\nemotion!\r\n\r\nAfter saying my prayers I would wrap myself up in the bedclothes. My\r\nheart would feel light, peaceful, and happy, and one dream would follow\r\nanother. Dreams of what? They were all of them vague, but all of them\r\nfull of pure love and of a sort of expectation of happiness. I remember,\r\ntoo, that I used to think about Karl Ivanitch and his sad lot. He was\r\nthe only unhappy being whom I knew, and so sorry would I feel for him,\r\nand so much did I love him, that tears would fall from my eyes as I\r\nthought, "May God give him happiness, and enable me to help him and to\r\nlessen his sorrow. I could make any sacrifice for him!" Usually, also,\r\nthere would be some favourite toy--a china dog or hare--stuck into the\r\nbed-corner behind the pillow, and it would please me to think how warm\r\nand comfortable and well cared-for it was there. Also, I would pray God\r\nto make every one happy, so that every one might be contented, and also\r\nto send fine weather to-morrow for our walk. Then I would turn myself\r\nover on to the other side, and thoughts and dreams would become jumbled\r\nand entangled together until at last I slept soundly and peacefully,\r\nthough with a face wet with tears.\r\n\r\nDo in after life the freshness and light-heartedness, the craving for\r\nlove and for strength of faith, ever return which we experience in our\r\nchildhood\'s years? What better time is there in our lives than when\r\nthe two best of virtues--innocent gaiety and a boundless yearning for\r\naffection--are our sole objects of pursuit?\r\n\r\nWhere now are our ardent prayers? Where now are our best gifts--the pure\r\ntears of emotion which a guardian angel dries with a smile as he sheds\r\nupon us lovely dreams of ineffable childish joy? Can it be that life has\r\nleft such heavy traces upon one\'s heart that those tears and ecstasies\r\nare for ever vanished? Can it be that there remains to us only the\r\nrecollection of them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI -- VERSE-MAKING\r\n\r\nRATHER less than a month after our arrival in Moscow I was sitting\r\nupstairs in my Grandmamma\'s house and doing some writing at a large\r\ntable. Opposite to me sat the drawing master, who was giving a few\r\nfinishing touches to the head of a turbaned Turk, executed in black\r\npencil. Woloda, with out-stretched neck, was standing behind the drawing\r\nmaster and looking over his shoulder. The head was Woloda\'s first\r\nproduction in pencil and to-day--Grandmamma\'s name-day--the masterpiece\r\nwas to be presented to her.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to put a little more shadow there?" said Woloda to\r\nthe master as he raised himself on tiptoe and pointed to the Turk\'s\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n"No, it is not necessary," the master replied as he put pencil and\r\ndrawing-pen into a japanned folding box. "It is just right now, and\r\nyou need not do anything more to it. As for you, Nicolinka," he added,\r\nrising and glancing askew at the Turk, "won\'t you tell us your great\r\nsecret at last? What are you going to give your Grandmamma? I think\r\nanother head would be your best gift. But good-bye, gentlemen," and\r\ntaking his hat and cardboard he departed.\r\n\r\nI too had thought that another head than the one at which I had been\r\nworking would be a better gift; so, when we were told that Grandmamma\'s\r\nname-day was soon to come round and that we must each of us have a\r\npresent ready for her, I had taken it into my head to write some\r\nverses in honour of the occasion, and had forthwith composed two rhymed\r\ncouplets, hoping that the rest would soon materialise. I really do not\r\nknow how the idea--one so peculiar for a child--came to occur to me, but\r\nI know that I liked it vastly, and answered all questions on the subject\r\nof my gift by declaring that I should soon have something ready for\r\nGrandmamma, but was not going to say what it was.\r\n\r\nContrary to my expectation, I found that, after the first two couplets\r\nexecuted in the initial heat of enthusiasm, even my most strenuous\r\nefforts refused to produce another one. I began to read different poems\r\nin our books, but neither Dimitrieff nor Derzhavin could help me. On\r\nthe contrary, they only confirmed my sense of incompetence. Knowing,\r\nhowever, that Karl Ivanitch was fond of writing verses, I stole softly\r\nupstairs to burrow among his papers, and found, among a number of German\r\nverses, some in the Russian language which seemed to have come from his\r\nown pen.\r\n\r\n     To L\r\n\r\n     Remember near\r\n     Remember far,\r\n     Remember me.\r\n     To-day be faithful, and for ever--\r\n     Aye, still beyond the grave--remember\r\n     That I have well loved thee.\r\n\r\n     "KARL MAYER."\r\n\r\nThese verses (which were written in a fine, round hand on thin\r\nletter-paper) pleased me with the touching sentiment with which they\r\nseemed to be inspired. I learnt them by heart, and decided to take them\r\nas a model. The thing was much easier now. By the time the name-day had\r\narrived I had completed a twelve-couplet congratulatory ode, and sat\r\ndown to the table in our school-room to copy them out on vellum.\r\n\r\nTwo sheets were soon spoiled--not because I found it necessary to alter\r\nanything (the verses seemed to me perfect), but because, after the third\r\nline, the tail-end of each successive one would go curving upward and\r\nmaking it plain to all the world that the whole thing had been written\r\nwith a want of adherence to the horizontal--a thing which I could not\r\nbear to see.\r\n\r\nThe third sheet also came out crooked, but I determined to make it do.\r\nIn my verses I congratulated Grandmamma, wished her many happy returns,\r\nand concluded thus:\r\n\r\n     "Endeavouring you to please and cheer,\r\n      We love you like our Mother dear."\r\n\r\nThis seemed to me not bad, yet it offended my ear somehow.\r\n\r\n"Lo-ve you li-ike our Mo-ther dear," I repeated to myself. "What other\r\nrhyme could I use instead of \'dear\'? Fear? Steer? Well, it must go at\r\nthat. At least the verses are better than Karl Ivanitch\'s."\r\n\r\nAccordingly I added the last verse to the rest. Then I went into\r\nour bedroom and recited the whole poem aloud with much feeling and\r\ngesticulation. The verses were altogether guiltless of metre, but I\r\ndid not stop to consider that. Yet the last one displeased me more than\r\never. As I sat on my bed I thought:\r\n\r\n"Why on earth did I write \'like our Mother dear\'? She is not here, and\r\ntherefore she need never have been mentioned. True, I love and respect\r\nGrandmamma, but she is not quite the same as--Why DID I write that?\r\nWhat did I go and tell a lie for? They may be verses only, yet I needn\'t\r\nquite have done that."\r\n\r\nAt that moment the tailor arrived with some new clothes for us.\r\n\r\n"Well, so be it!" I said in much vexation as I crammed the verses\r\nhastily under my pillow and ran down to adorn myself in the new Moscow\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nThey fitted marvellously-both the brown jacket with yellow buttons (a\r\ngarment made skin-tight and not "to allow room for growth," as in\r\nthe country) and the black trousers (also close-fitting so that they\r\ndisplayed the figure and lay smoothly over the boots).\r\n\r\n"At last I have real trousers on!" I thought as I looked at my legs with\r\nthe utmost satisfaction. I concealed from every one the fact that the\r\nnew clothes were horribly tight and uncomfortable, but, on the contrary,\r\nsaid that, if there were a fault, it was that they were not tight\r\nenough. For a long while I stood before the looking-glass as I combed\r\nmy elaborately pomaded head, but, try as I would, I could not reduce the\r\ntopmost hairs on the crown to order. As soon as ever I left off combing\r\nthem, they sprang up again and radiated in different directions, thus\r\ngiving my face a ridiculous expression.\r\n\r\nKarl Ivanitch was dressing in another room, and I heard some one\r\nbring him his blue frockcoat and under-linen. Then at the door leading\r\ndownstairs I heard a maid-servant\'s voice, and went to see what she\r\nwanted. In her hand she held a well-starched shirt which she said she\r\nhad been sitting up all night to get ready. I took it, and asked if\r\nGrandmamma was up yet.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, she has had her coffee, and the priest has come. My word, but\r\nyou look a fine little fellow!" added the girl with a smile at my new\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nThis observation made me blush, so I whirled round on one leg, snapped\r\nmy fingers, and went skipping away, in the hope that by these manoeuvres\r\nI should make her sensible that even yet she had not realised quite what\r\na fine fellow I was.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I took the shirt to Karl I found that he did not need it,\r\nhaving taken another one. Standing before a small looking-glass, he tied\r\nhis cravat with both hands--trying, by various motions of his head, to\r\nsee whether it fitted him comfortably or not--and then took us down to\r\nsee Grandmamma. To this day I cannot help laughing when I remember what\r\na smell of pomade the three of us left behind us on the staircase as we\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nKarl was carrying a box which he had made himself, Woloda, his drawing,\r\nand I my verses, while each of us also had a form of words ready with\r\nwhich to present his gift. Just as Karl opened the door, the priest put\r\non his vestment and began to say prayers.\r\n\r\nDuring the ceremony Grandmamma stood leaning over the back of a chair,\r\nwith her head bent down. Near her stood Papa. He turned and smiled at us\r\nas we hurriedly thrust our presents behind our backs and tried to remain\r\nunobserved by the door. The whole effect of a surprise, upon which we\r\nhad been counting, was entirely lost. When at last every one had made\r\nthe sign of the cross I became intolerably oppressed with a sudden,\r\ninvincible, and deadly attack of shyness, so that the courage to, offer\r\nmy present completely failed me. I hid myself behind Karl Ivanitch, who\r\nsolemnly congratulated Grandmamma and, transferring his box from his\r\nright hand to his left, presented it to her. Then he withdrew a few\r\nsteps to make way for Woloda. Grandmamma seemed highly pleased with\r\nthe box (which was adorned with a gold border), and smiled in the most\r\nfriendly manner in order to express her gratitude. Yet it was evident\r\nthat, she did not know where to set the box down, and this probably\r\naccounts for the fact that she handed it to Papa, at the same time\r\nbidding him observe how beautifully it was made.\r\n\r\nHis curiosity satisfied, Papa handed the box to the priest, who also\r\nseemed particularly delighted with it, and looked with astonishment,\r\nfirst at the article itself, and then at the artist who could make\r\nsuch wonderful things. Then Woloda presented his Turk, and received a\r\nsimilarly flattering ovation on all sides.\r\n\r\nIt was my turn now, and Grandmamma turned to me with her kindest smile.\r\nThose who have experienced what embarrassment is know that it is a\r\nfeeling which grows in direct proportion to delay, while decision\r\ndecreases in similar measure. In other words the longer the condition\r\nlasts, the more invincible does it become, and the smaller does the\r\npower of decision come to be.\r\n\r\nMy last remnants of nerve and energy had forsaken me while Karl and\r\nWoloda had been offering their presents, and my shyness now reached its\r\nculminating point, I felt the blood rushing from my heart to my head,\r\none blush succeeding another across my face, and drops of perspiration\r\nbeginning to stand out on my brow and nose. My ears were burning, I\r\ntrembled from head to foot, and, though I kept changing from one foot to\r\nthe other, I remained rooted where I stood.\r\n\r\n"Well, Nicolinka, tell us what you have brought?" said Papa. "Is it a\r\nbox or a drawing?"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else to be done. With a trembling hand held out the\r\nfolded, fatal paper, but my voiced failed me completely and I stood\r\nbefore Grandmamma in silence. I could not get rid of the dreadful idea\r\nthat, instead of a display of the expected drawing, some bad verses of\r\nmine were about to be read aloud before every one, and that the words\r\n"our Mother dear" would clearly prove that I had never loved, but had\r\nonly forgotten, her. How shall I express my sufferings when Grandmamma\r\nbegan to read my poetry aloud?--when, unable to decipher it, she stopped\r\nhalf-way and looked at Papa with a smile (which I took to be one of\r\nridicule)?--when she did not pronounce it as I had meant it to be\r\npronounced?--and when her weak sight not allowing her to finish it, she\r\nhanded the paper to Papa and requested him to read it all over again\r\nfrom the beginning? I fancied that she must have done this last because\r\nshe did not like to read such a lot of stupid, crookedly written stuff\r\nherself, yet wanted to point out to Papa my utter lack of feeling. I\r\nexpected him to slap me in the face with the verses and say, "You bad\r\nboy! So you have forgotten your Mamma! Take that for it!" Yet nothing\r\nof the sort happened. On the contrary, when the whole had been read,\r\nGrandmamma said, "Charming!" and kissed me on the forehead. Then our\r\npresents, together with two cambric pocket-handkerchiefs and a snuff-box\r\nengraved with Mamma\'s portrait, were laid on the table attached to the\r\ngreat Voltairian arm-chair in which Grandmamma always sat.\r\n\r\n"The Princess Barbara Ilinitsha!" announced one of the two footmen who\r\nused to stand behind Grandmamma\'s carriage, but Grandmamma was looking\r\nthoughtfully at the portrait on the snuff-box, and returned no answer.\r\n\r\n"Shall I show her in, madam?" repeated the footman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII -- THE PRINCESS KORNAKOFF\r\n\r\n"Yes, show her in," said Grandmamma, settling herself as far back in\r\nher arm-chair as possible. The Princess was a woman of about\r\nforty-five, small and delicate, with a shrivelled skin and disagreeable,\r\ngreyish-green eyes, the expression of which contradicted the unnaturally\r\nsuave look of the rest of her face. Underneath her velvet bonnet,\r\nadorned with an ostrich feather, was visible some reddish hair, while\r\nagainst the unhealthy colour of her skin her eyebrows and eyelashes\r\nlooked even lighter and redder that they would other wise have done.\r\nYet, for all that, her animated movements, small hands, and peculiarly\r\ndry features communicated something aristocratic and energetic to her\r\ngeneral appearance. She talked a great deal, and, to judge from her\r\neloquence, belonged to that class of persons who always speak as though\r\nsome one were contradicting them, even though no one else may be saying\r\na word. First she would raise her voice, then lower it and then take on\r\na fresh access of vivacity as she looked at the persons present, but not\r\nparticipating in the conversation, with an air of endeavouring to draw\r\nthem into it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Princess kissed Grandmamma\'s hand and repeatedly called her\r\n"my good Aunt," I could see that Grandmamma did not care much about her,\r\nfor she kept raising her eyebrows in a peculiar way while listening\r\nto the Princess\'s excuses why Prince Michael had been prevented from\r\ncalling, and congratulating Grandmamma "as he would like so-much to\r\nhave done." At length, however, she answered the Princess\'s French with\r\nRussian, and with a sharp accentuation of certain words.\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to you for your kindness," she said. "As for Prince\r\nMichael\'s absence, pray do not mention it. He has so much else to do.\r\nBesides, what pleasure could he find in coming to see an old woman like\r\nme?" Then, without allowing the Princess time to reply, she went on:\r\n"How are your children my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Well, thank God, Aunt, they grow and do their lessons and\r\nplay--particularly my eldest one, Etienne, who is so wild that it\r\nis almost impossible to keep him in order. Still, he is a clever and\r\npromising boy. Would you believe it, cousin," (this last to Papa, since\r\nGrandmamma altogether uninterested in the Princess\'s children, had\r\nturned to us, taken my verses out from beneath the presentation box, and\r\nunfolded them again), "would you believe it, but one day not long ago--"\r\nand leaning over towards Papa, the Princess related something or other\r\nwith great vivacity. Then, her tale concluded, she laughed, and, with a\r\nquestioning look at Papa, went on:\r\n\r\n"What a boy, cousin! He ought to have been whipped, but the trick was\r\nso spirited and amusing that I let him off." Then the Princess looked at\r\nGrandmamma and laughed again.\r\n\r\n"Ah! So you WHIP your children, do you" said Grandmamma, with a\r\nsignificant lift of her eyebrows, and laying a peculiar stress on the\r\nword "WHIP."\r\n\r\n"Alas, my good Aunt," replied the Princess in a sort of tolerant tone\r\nand with another glance at Papa, "I know your views on the subject, but\r\nmust beg to be allowed to differ with them. However much I have thought\r\nover and read and talked about the matter, I have always been forced to\r\ncome to the conclusion that children must be ruled through FEAR. To make\r\nsomething of a child, you must make it FEAR something. Is it not so,\r\ncousin? And what, pray, do children fear so much as a rod?"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she seemed, to look inquiringly at Woloda and myself, and I\r\nconfess that I did not feel altogether comfortable.\r\n\r\n"Whatever you may say," she went on, "a boy of twelve, or even of\r\nfourteen, is still a child and should be whipped as such; but with\r\ngirls, perhaps, it is another matter."\r\n\r\n"How lucky it is that I am not her son!" I thought to myself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," said Grandmamma, folding up my verses and replacing\r\nthem beneath the box (as though, after that exposition of views, the\r\nPrincess was unworthy of the honour of listening to such a production).\r\n"Very well, my dear," she repeated "But please tell me how, in return,\r\nyou can look for any delicate sensibility from your children?"\r\n\r\nEvidently Grandmamma thought this argument unanswerable, for she cut the\r\nsubject short by adding:\r\n\r\n"However, it is a point on which people must follow their own opinions."\r\n\r\nThe Princess did not choose to reply, but smiled condescendingly, and as\r\nthough out of indulgence to the strange prejudices of a person whom she\r\nonly PRETENDED to revere.\r\n\r\n"Oh, by the way, pray introduce me to your young people," she went on\r\npresently as she threw us another gracious smile.\r\n\r\nThereupon we rose and stood looking at the Princess, without in the\r\nleast knowing what we ought to do to show that we were being introduced.\r\n\r\n"Kiss the Princess\'s hand," said Papa.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope you will love your old aunt," she said to Woloda, kissing\r\nhis hair, "even though we are not near relatives. But I value friendship\r\nfar more than I do degrees of relationship," she added to Grandmamma,\r\nwho nevertheless, remained hostile, and replied:\r\n\r\n"Eh, my dear? Is that what they think of relationships nowadays?"\r\n\r\n"Here is my man of the world," put in Papa, indicating Woloda; "and here\r\nis my poet," he added as I kissed the small, dry hand of the Princess,\r\nwith a vivid picture in my mind of that same hand holding a rod and\r\napplying it vigorously.\r\n\r\n"WHICH one is the poet?" asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n"This little one," replied Papa, smiling; "the one with the tuft of hair\r\non his top-knot."\r\n\r\n"Why need he bother about my tuft?" I thought to myself as I retired\r\ninto a corner. "Is there nothing else for him to talk about?"\r\n\r\nI had strange ideas on manly beauty. I considered Karl Ivanitch one of\r\nthe handsomest men in the world, and myself so ugly that I had no need\r\nto deceive myself on that point. Therefore any remark on the subject of\r\nmy exterior offended me extremely. I well remember how, one day after\r\nluncheon (I was then six years of age), the talk fell upon my personal\r\nappearance, and how Mamma tried to find good features in my face, and\r\nsaid that I had clever eyes and a charming smile; how, nevertheless,\r\nwhen Papa had examined me, and proved the contrary, she was obliged to\r\nconfess that I was ugly; and how, when the meal was over and I went\r\nto pay her my respects, she said as she patted my cheek; "You know,\r\nNicolinka, nobody will ever love you for your face alone, so you must\r\ntry all the more to be a good and clever boy."\r\n\r\nAlthough these words of hers confirmed in me my conviction that I was\r\nnot handsome, they also confirmed in me an ambition to be just such\r\na boy as she had indicated. Yet I had my moments of despair at my\r\nugliness, for I thought that no human being with such a large nose, such\r\nthick lips, and such small grey eyes as mine could ever hope to attain\r\nhappiness on this earth. I used to ask God to perform a miracle by\r\nchanging me into a beauty, and would have given all that I possessed, or\r\never hoped to possess, to have a handsome face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII -- PRINCE IVAN IVANOVITCH\r\n\r\nWhen the Princess had heard my verses and overwhelmed the writer of them\r\nwith praise, Grandmamma softened to her a little. She began to address\r\nher in French and to cease calling her "my dear." Likewise she invited\r\nher to return that evening with her children. This invitation having\r\nbeen accepted, the Princess took her leave. After that, so many other\r\ncallers came to congratulate Grandmamma that the courtyard was crowded\r\nall day long with carriages.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, my dear cousin," was the greeting of one guest in\r\nparticular as he entered the room and kissed Grandmamma\'s hand. He was\r\na man of seventy, with a stately figure clad in a military uniform and\r\nadorned with large epaulettes, an embroidered collar, and a white cross\r\nround the neck. His face, with its quiet and open expression, as well\r\nas the simplicity and ease of his manners, greatly pleased me, for, in\r\nspite of the thin half-circle of hair which was all that was now left\r\nto him, and the want of teeth disclosed by the set of his upper lip, his\r\nface was a remarkably handsome one.\r\n\r\nThanks to his fine character, handsome exterior, remarkable valour,\r\ninfluential relatives, and, above all, good fortune, Prince, Ivan\r\nIvanovitch had early made himself a career. As that career progressed,\r\nhis ambition had met with a success which left nothing more to be sought\r\nfor in that direction. From his earliest youth upward he had prepared\r\nhimself to fill the exalted station in the world to which fate actually\r\ncalled him later; wherefore, although in his prosperous life (as in the\r\nlives of all) there had been failures, misfortunes, and cares, he had\r\nnever lost his quietness of character, his elevated tone of thought, or\r\nhis peculiarly moral, religious bent of mind. Consequently, though he\r\nhad won the universal esteem of his fellows, he had done so less through\r\nhis important position than through his perseverance and integrity.\r\nWhile not of specially distinguished intellect, the eminence of his\r\nstation (whence he could afford to look down upon all petty questions)\r\nhad caused him to adopt high points of view. Though in reality he was\r\nkind and sympathetic, in manner he appeared cold and haughty--probably\r\nfor the reason that he had forever to be on his guard against the\r\nendless claims and petitions of people who wished to profit through\r\nhis influence. Yet even then his coldness was mitigated by the polite\r\ncondescension of a man well accustomed to move in the highest circles\r\nof society. Well-educated, his culture was that of a youth of the end of\r\nthe last century. He had read everything, whether philosophy or belles\r\nlettres, which that age had produced in France, and loved to quote from\r\nRacine, Corneille, Boileau, Moliere, Montaigne, and Fenelon. Likewise he\r\nhad gleaned much history from Segur, and much of the old classics from\r\nFrench translations of them; but for mathematics, natural philosophy, or\r\ncontemporary literature he cared nothing whatever. However, he knew how\r\nto be silent in conversation, as well as when to make general remarks\r\non authors whom he had never read--such as Goethe, Schiller, and Byron.\r\nMoreover, despite his exclusively French education, he was simple in\r\nspeech and hated originality (which he called the mark of an untutored\r\nnature). Wherever he lived, society was a necessity to him, and, both in\r\nMoscow and the country he had his reception days, on which practically\r\n"all the town" called upon him. An introduction from him was a passport\r\nto every drawing-room; few young and pretty ladies in society objected\r\nto offering him their rosy cheeks for a paternal salute; and people even\r\nin the highest positions felt flattered by invitations to his parties.\r\n\r\nThe Prince had few friends left now like Grandmamma--that is to say, few\r\nfriends who were of the same standing as himself, who had had the same\r\nsort of education, and who saw things from the same point of view:\r\nwherefore he greatly valued his intimate, long-standing friendship with\r\nher, and always showed her the highest respect.\r\n\r\nI hardly dared to look at the Prince, since the honour paid him on all\r\nsides, the huge epaulettes, the peculiar pleasure with which Grandmamma\r\nreceived him, and the fact that he alone, seemed in no way afraid of\r\nher, but addressed her with perfect freedom (even being so daring as to\r\ncall her "cousin"), awakened in me a feeling of reverence for his person\r\nalmost equal to that which I felt for Grandmamma herself.\r\n\r\nOn being shown my verses, he called me to his side, and said:\r\n\r\n"Who knows, my cousin, but that he may prove to be a second Derzhavin?"\r\nNevertheless he pinched my cheek so hard that I was only prevented from\r\ncrying by the thought that it must be meant for a caress.\r\n\r\nGradually the other guests dispersed, and with them Papa and Woloda.\r\nThus only Grandmamma, the Prince, and myself were left in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Why has our dear Natalia Nicolaevna not come to-day" asked the Prince\r\nafter a silence.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my friend," replied Grandmamma, lowering her voice and laying a\r\nhand upon the sleeve of his uniform, "she would certainly have come if\r\nshe had been at liberty to do what she likes. She wrote to me that Peter\r\nhad proposed bringing her with him to town, but that she had refused,\r\nsince their income had not been good this year, and she could see\r\nno real reason why the whole family need come to Moscow, seeing that\r\nLubotshka was as yet very young and that the boys were living with me--a\r\nfact, she said, which made her feel as safe about them as though she had\r\nbeen living with them herself."\r\n\r\n"True, it is good for the boys to be here," went on Grandmamma, yet in\r\na tone which showed clearly that she did not think it was so very good,\r\n"since it was more than time that they should be sent to Moscow to\r\nstudy, as well as to learn how to comport themselves in society. What\r\nsort of an education could they have got in the country? The eldest boy\r\nwill soon be thirteen, and the second one eleven. As yet, my cousin,\r\nthey are quite untaught, and do not know even how to enter a room."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless" said the Prince, "I cannot understand these complaints\r\nof ruined fortunes. He has a very handsome income, and Natalia has\r\nChabarovska, where we used to act plays, and which I know as well as\r\nI do my own hand. It is a splendid property, and ought to bring in an\r\nexcellent return."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Grandmamma with a sad expression on her face, "I do not\r\nmind telling you, as my most intimate friend, that all this seems to me\r\na mere pretext on his part for living alone, for strolling about from\r\nclub to club, for attending dinner-parties, and for resorting to--well,\r\nwho knows what? She suspects nothing; you know her angelic sweetness and\r\nher implicit trust of him in everything. He had only to tell her that\r\nthe children must go to Moscow and that she must be left behind in the\r\ncountry with a stupid governess for company, for her to believe him! I\r\nalmost think that if he were to say that the children must be whipped\r\njust as the Princess Barbara whips hers, she would believe even that!"\r\nand Grandmamma leant back in her arm-chair with an expression of\r\ncontempt. Then, after a moment of silence, during which she took her\r\nhandkerchief out of her pocket to wipe away a few tears which had stolen\r\ndown her cheeks, she went, on:\r\n\r\n"Yes, my friend, I often think that he cannot value and understand\r\nher properly, and that, for all her goodness and love of him and her\r\nendeavours to conceal her grief (which, however as I know only too well,\r\nexists). She cannot really be happy with him. Mark my words if he does\r\nnot--" Here Grandmamma buried her face in the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear old friend," said the Prince reproachfully. "I think you\r\nare unreasonable. Why grieve and weep over imagined evils? That is\r\nnot right. I have known him a long time, and feel sure that he is an\r\nattentive, kind, and excellent husband, as well as (which is the chief\r\nthing of all) a perfectly honourable man."\r\n\r\nAt this point, having been an involuntary auditor of a conversation\r\nnot meant for my ears, I stole on tiptoe out of the room, in a state of\r\ngreat distress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX -- THE IWINS\r\n\r\n"Woloda, Woloda! The Iwins are just coming." I shouted on seeing from\r\nthe window three boys in blue overcoats, and followed by a young tutor,\r\nadvancing along the pavement opposite our house.\r\n\r\nThe Iwins were related to us, and of about the same age as ourselves. We\r\nhad made their acquaintance soon after our arrival in Moscow. The second\r\nbrother, Seriosha, had dark curly hair, a turned-up, strongly pronounced\r\nnose, very bright red lips (which, never being quite shut, showed a\r\nrow of white teeth), beautiful dark-blue eyes, and an uncommonly bold\r\nexpression of face. He never smiled but was either wholly serious or\r\nlaughing a clear, merry, agreeable laugh. His striking good looks had\r\ncaptivated me from the first, and I felt an irresistible attraction\r\ntowards him. Only to see him filled me with pleasure, and at one time my\r\nwhole mental faculties used to be concentrated in the wish that I\r\nmight do so. If three or four days passed without my seeing him I felt\r\nlistless and ready to cry. Awake or asleep, I was forever dreaming of\r\nhim. On going to bed I used to see him in my dreams, and when I had\r\nshut my eyes and called up a picture of him I hugged the vision as\r\nmy choicest delight. So much store did I set upon this feeling for my\r\nfriend that I never mentioned it to any one. Nevertheless, it must have\r\nannoyed him to see my admiring eyes constantly fixed upon him, or else\r\nhe must have felt no reciprocal attraction, for he always preferred to\r\nplay and talk with Woloda. Still, even with that I felt satisfied, and\r\nwished and asked for nothing better than to be ready at any time to make\r\nany sacrifice for him. Likewise, over and above the strange fascination\r\nwhich he exercised upon me, I always felt another sensation, namely,\r\na dread of making him angry, of offending him, of displeasing him. Was\r\nthis because his face bore such a haughty expression, or because I,\r\ndespising my own exterior, over-rated the beautiful in others, or,\r\nlastly (and most probably), because it is a common sign of affection?\r\nAt all events, I felt as much fear, of him as I did love. The first time\r\nthat he spoke to me I was so overwhelmed with sudden happiness that I\r\nturned pale, then red, and could not utter a word. He had an ugly habit\r\nof blinking when considering anything seriously, as well as of twitching\r\nhis nose and eyebrows. Consequently every one thought that this habit\r\nmarred his face. Yet I thought it such a nice one that I involuntarily\r\nadopted it for myself, until, a few days after I had made his\r\nacquaintance, Grandmamma suddenly asked me whether my eyes were hurting\r\nme, since I was winking like an owl! Never a word of affection passed\r\nbetween us, yet he felt his power over me, and unconsciously but\r\ntyrannically, exercised it in all our childish intercourse. I used to\r\nlong to tell him all that was in my heart, yet was too much afraid of\r\nhim to be frank in any way, and, while submitting myself to his will,\r\ntried to appear merely careless and indifferent. Although at times his\r\ninfluence seemed irksome and intolerable, to throw it off was beyond my\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nI often think with regret of that fresh, beautiful feeling of boundless,\r\ndisinterested love which came to an end without having ever found\r\nself-expression or return. It is strange how, when a child, I always\r\nlonged to be like grown-up people, and yet how I have often longed,\r\nsince childhood\'s days, for those days to come back to me! Many times,\r\nin my relations with Seriosha, this wish to resemble grown-up people\r\nput a rude check upon the love that was waiting to expand, and made me\r\nrepress it. Not only was I afraid of kissing him, or of taking his hand\r\nand saying how glad I was to see him, but I even dreaded calling him\r\n"Seriosha" and always said "Sergius" as every one else did in our\r\nhouse. Any expression of affection would have seemed like evidence of\r\nchildishness, and any one who indulged in it, a baby. Not having yet\r\npassed through those bitter experiences which enforce upon older years\r\ncircumspection and coldness, I deprived myself of the pure delight of\r\na fresh, childish instinct for the absurd purpose of trying to resemble\r\ngrown-up people.\r\n\r\nI met the Iwins in the ante-room, welcomed them, and then ran to tell\r\nGrandmamma of their arrival with an expression as happy as though she\r\nwere certain to be equally delighted. Then, never taking my eyes off\r\nSeriosha, I conducted the visitors to the drawing-room, and eagerly\r\nfollowed every movement of my favourite. When Grandmamma spoke to\r\nand fixed her penetrating glance upon him, I experienced that mingled\r\nsensation of pride and solicitude which an artist might feel when\r\nwaiting for revered lips to pronounce a judgment upon his work.\r\n\r\nWith Grandmamma\'s permission, the Iwins\' young tutor, Herr Frost,\r\naccompanied us into the little back garden, where he seated himself\r\nupon a bench, arranged his legs in a tasteful attitude, rested his\r\nbrass-knobbed cane between them, lighted a cigar, and assumed the air\r\nof a man well-pleased with himself. He was a German, but of a very\r\ndifferent sort to our good Karl Ivanitch. In the first place, he spoke\r\nboth Russian and French correctly, though with a hard accent Indeed,\r\nhe enjoyed--especially among the ladies--the reputation of being a very\r\naccomplished fellow. In the second place, he wore a reddish moustache,\r\na large gold pin set with a ruby, a black satin tie, and a very\r\nfashionable suit. Lastly, he was young, with a handsome, self-satisfied\r\nface and fine muscular legs. It was clear that he set the greatest store\r\nupon the latter, and thought them beyond compare, especially as regards\r\nthe favour of the ladies. Consequently, whether sitting or standing, he\r\nalways tried to exhibit them in the most favourable light. In short,\r\nhe was a type of the young German-Russian whose main desire is to be\r\nthought perfectly gallant and gentlemanly.\r\n\r\nIn the little garden merriment reigned. In fact, the game of "robbers"\r\nnever went better. Yet an incident occurred which came near to spoiling\r\nit. Seriosha was the robber, and in pouncing upon some travellers he\r\nfell down and knocked his leg so badly against a tree that I thought\r\nthe leg must be broken. Consequently, though I was the gendarme and\r\ntherefore bound to apprehend him, I only asked him anxiously, when I\r\nreached him, if he had hurt himself very much. Nevertheless this threw\r\nhim into a passion, and made him exclaim with fists clenched and in a\r\nvoice which showed by its faltering what pain he was enduring, "Why,\r\nwhatever is the matter? Is this playing the game properly? You ought\r\nto arrest me. Why on earth don\'t you do so?" This he repeated several\r\ntimes, and then, seeing Woloda and the elder Iwin (who were taking the\r\npart of the travellers) jumping and running about the path, he suddenly\r\nthrew himself upon them with a shout and loud laughter to effect\r\ntheir capture. I cannot express my wonder and delight at this valiant\r\nbehaviour of my hero. In spite of the severe pain, he had not only\r\nrefrained from crying, but had repressed the least symptom of suffering\r\nand kept his eye fixed upon the game! Shortly after this occurrence\r\nanother boy, Ilinka Grap, joined our party. We went upstairs, and\r\nSeriosha gave me an opportunity of still further appreciating and taking\r\ndelight in his manly bravery and fortitude. This was how it was.\r\n\r\nIlinka was the son of a poor foreigner who had been under certain\r\nobligations to my Grandpapa, and now thought it incumbent upon him to\r\nsend his son to us as frequently as possible. Yet if he thought that the\r\nacquaintance would procure his son any advancement or pleasure, he was\r\nentirely mistaken, for not only were we anything but friendly to Ilinka,\r\nbut it was seldom that we noticed him at all except to laugh at him. He\r\nwas a boy of thirteen, tall and thin, with a pale, birdlike face, and\r\na quiet, good-tempered expression. Though poorly dressed, he always had\r\nhis head so thickly pomaded that we used to declare that on warm days\r\nit melted and ran down his neck. When I think of him now, it seems to\r\nme that he was a very quiet, obliging, and good-tempered boy, but at\r\nthe time I thought him a creature so contemptible that he was not worth\r\neither attention or pity.\r\n\r\nUpstairs we set ourselves to astonish each other with gymnastic tours de\r\nforce. Ilinka watched us with a faint smile of admiration, but refused\r\nan invitation to attempt a similar feat, saying that he had no strength.\r\n\r\nSeriosha was extremely captivating. His face and eyes glowed with\r\nlaughter as he surprised us with tricks which we had never seen before.\r\nHe jumped over three chairs put together, turned somersaults right\r\nacross the room, and finally stood on his head on a pyramid of\r\nTatistchev\'s dictionaries, moving his legs about with such comical\r\nrapidity that it was impossible not to help bursting with merriment.\r\n\r\nAfter this last trick he pondered for a moment (blinking his eyes as\r\nusual), and then went up to Ilinka with a very serious face.\r\n\r\n"Try and do that," he said. "It is not really difficult."\r\n\r\nIlinka, observing that the general attention was fixed upon him,\r\nblushed, and said in an almost inaudible voice that he could not do the\r\nfeat.\r\n\r\n"Well, what does he mean by doing nothing at all? What a girl the fellow\r\nis! He has just GOT to stand on his head," and Seriosha, took him by the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, on your head at once! This instant, this instant!" every one\r\nshouted as we ran upon Ilinka and dragged him to the dictionaries,\r\ndespite his being visibly pale and frightened.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone! You are tearing my jacket!" cried the unhappy victim,\r\nbut his exclamations of despair only encouraged us the more. We were\r\ndying with laughter, while the green jacket was bursting at every seam.\r\n\r\nWoloda and the eldest Iwin took his head and placed it on the\r\ndictionaries, while Seriosha, and I seized his poor, thin legs (his\r\nstruggles had stripped them upwards to the knees), and with boisterous,\r\nlaughter held them uptight--the youngest Iwin superintending his general\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a moment of silence occurred amid our boisterous laughter--a\r\nmoment during which nothing was to be heard in the room but the panting\r\nof the miserable Ilinka. It occurred to me at that moment that, after\r\nall, there was nothing so very comical and pleasant in all this.\r\n\r\n"Now, THAT\'S a boy!" cried Seriosha, giving Ilinka a smack with his\r\nhand. Ilinka said nothing, but made such desperate movements with his\r\nlegs to free himself that his foot suddenly kicked Seriosha in the\r\neye: with the result that, letting go of Ilinka\'s leg and covering the\r\nwounded member with one hand, Seriosha hit out at him with all his might\r\nwith the other one. Of course Ilinka\'s legs slipped down as, sinking\r\nexhausted to the floor and half-suffocated with tears, he stammered out:\r\n\r\n"Why should you bully me so?"\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow\'s miserable figure, with its streaming tears, ruffled\r\nhair, and crumpled trousers revealing dirty boots, touched us a little,\r\nand we stood silent and trying to smile.\r\n\r\nSeriosha was the first to recover himself.\r\n\r\n"What a girl! What a gaby!" he said, giving Ilinka a slight kick. "He\r\ncan\'t take things in fun a bit. Well, get up, then."\r\n\r\n"You are an utter beast! That\'s what YOU are!" said Ilinka, turning\r\nmiserably away and sobbing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh! Would it still kick and show temper, then?" cried Seriosha,\r\nseizing a dictionary and throwing it at the unfortunate boy\'s head.\r\nApparently it never occurred to Ilinka to take refuge from the missile;\r\nhe merely guarded his head with his hands.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s enough now," added Seriosha, with a forced laugh. "You\r\nDESERVE to be hurt if you can\'t take things in fun. Now let\'s go\r\ndownstairs."\r\n\r\nI could not help looking with some compassion at the miserable creature\r\non the floor as, his face buried in the dictionary, he lay there sobbing\r\nalmost as though he were in a fit.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sergius!" I said. "Why have you done this?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you did it too! Besides, I did not cry this afternoon when I\r\nknocked my leg and nearly broke it."\r\n\r\n"True enough," I thought. "Ilinka is a poor whining sort of a chap,\r\nwhile Seriosha is a boy--a REAL boy."\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to my mind that possibly poor Ilinka was suffering\r\nfar less from bodily pain than from the thought that five companions\r\nfor whom he may have felt a genuine liking had, for no reason at all,\r\ncombined to hurt and humiliate him.\r\n\r\nI cannot explain my cruelty on this occasion. Why did I not step forward\r\nto comfort and protect him? Where was the pitifulness which often made\r\nme burst into tears at the sight of a young bird fallen from its nest,\r\nor of a puppy being thrown over a wall, or of a chicken being killed by\r\nthe cook for soup?\r\n\r\nCan it be that the better instinct in me was overshadowed by my\r\naffection for Seriosha and the desire to shine before so brave a boy? If\r\nso, how contemptible were both the affection and the desire! They alone\r\nform dark spots on the pages of my youthful recollections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX -- PREPARATIONS FOR THE PARTY\r\n\r\nTo judge from the extraordinary activity in the pantry, the shining\r\ncleanliness which imparted such a new and festal guise to certain\r\narticles in the salon and drawing-room which I had long known as\r\nanything but resplendent, and the arrival of some musicians whom Prince\r\nIvan would certainly not have sent for nothing, no small amount of\r\ncompany was to be expected that evening.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of every vehicle which chanced to pass the house I ran\r\nto the window, leaned my head upon my arms, and peered with impatient\r\ncuriosity into the street.\r\n\r\nAt last a carriage stopped at our door, and, in the full belief that\r\nthis must be the Iwins, who had promised to come early, I at once ran\r\ndownstairs to meet them in the hall.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of the Iwins, I beheld from behind the figure of the\r\nfootman who opened the door two female figures-one tall and wrapped in a\r\nblue cloak trimmed with marten, and the other one short and wrapped in\r\na green shawl from beneath which a pair of little feet, stuck into fur\r\nboots, peeped forth.\r\n\r\nWithout paying any attention to my presence in the hall (although I\r\nthought it my duty, on the appearance of these persons to salute them),\r\nthe shorter one moved towards the taller, and stood silently in front of\r\nher. Thereupon the tall lady untied the shawl which enveloped the head\r\nof the little one, and unbuttoned the cloak which hid her form; until,\r\nby the time that the footmen had taken charge of these articles and\r\nremoved the fur boots, there stood forth from the amorphous chrysalis\r\na charming girl of twelve, dressed in a short muslin frock, white\r\npantaloons, and smart black satin shoes. Around her, white neck she wore\r\na narrow black velvet ribbon, while her head was covered with flaxen\r\ncurls which so perfectly suited her beautiful face in front and her bare\r\nneck and shoulders behind that I, would have believed nobody, not even\r\nKarl Ivanitch, if he, or she had told me that they only hung so nicely\r\nbecause, ever since the morning, they had been screwed up in fragments\r\nof a Moscow newspaper and then warmed with a hot iron. To me it seemed\r\nas though she must have been born with those curls.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent feature in her face was a pair of unusually large\r\nhalf-veiled eyes, which formed a strange, but pleasing, contrast to the\r\nsmall mouth. Her lips were closed, while her eyes looked so grave that\r\nthe general expression of her face gave one the impression that a smile\r\nwas never to be looked for from her: wherefore, when a smile did come,\r\nit was all the more pleasing.\r\n\r\nTrying to escape notice, I slipped through the door of the salon,\r\nand then thought it necessary to be seen pacing to and fro, seemingly\r\nengaged in thought, as though unconscious of the arrival of guests.\r\n\r\nBY the time, however, that the ladies had advanced to the middle of\r\nthe salon I seemed suddenly to awake from my reverie and told them that\r\nGrandmamma was in the drawing room, Madame Valakhin, whose face pleased\r\nme extremely (especially since it bore a great resemblance to her\r\ndaughter\'s), stroked my head kindly.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma seemed delighted to see Sonetchka. She invited her to come\r\nto her, put back a curl which had fallen over her brow, and looking\r\nearnestly at her said, "What a charming child!"\r\n\r\nSonetchka blushed, smiled, and, indeed, looked so charming that I myself\r\nblushed as I looked at her.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are going to enjoy yourself here, my love," said\r\nGrandmamma. "Pray be as merry and dance as much as ever you can. See, we\r\nhave two beaux for her already," she added, turning to Madame Valakhin,\r\nand stretching out her hand to me.\r\n\r\nThis coupling of Sonetchka and myself pleased me so much that I blushed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nFeeling, presently, that, my embarrassment was increasing, and hearing\r\nthe sound of carriages approaching, I thought it wise to retire. In the\r\nhall I encountered the Princess Kornakoff, her son, and an incredible\r\nnumber of daughters. They had all of them the same face as their mother,\r\nand were very ugly. None of them arrested my attention. They talked in\r\nshrill tones as they took off their cloaks and boas, and laughed as they\r\nbustled about--probably at the fact that there were so many of them!\r\n\r\nEtienne was a boy of fifteen, tall and plump, with a sharp face,\r\ndeep-set bluish eyes, and very large hands and feet for his age.\r\nLikewise he was awkward, and had a nervous, unpleasing voice.\r\nNevertheless he seemed very pleased with himself, and was, in my\r\nopinion, a boy who could well bear being beaten with rods.\r\n\r\nFor a long time we confronted one another without speaking as we took\r\nstock of each other. When the flood of dresses had swept past I made\r\nshift to begin a conversation by asking him whether it had not been very\r\nclose in the carriage.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he answered indifferently. "I never ride inside it, for\r\nit makes me feel sick directly, and Mamma knows that. Whenever we are\r\ndriving anywhere at night-time I always sit on the box. I like that, for\r\nthen one sees everything. Philip gives me the reins, and sometimes the\r\nwhip too, and then the people inside get a regular--well, you know," he\r\nadded with a significant gesture "It\'s splendid then."\r\n\r\n"Master Etienne," said a footman, entering the hall, "Philip wishes me\r\nto ask you where you put the whip."\r\n\r\n"Where I put it? Why, I gave it back to him."\r\n\r\n"But he says that you did not."\r\n\r\n"Well, I laid it across the carriage-lamps!"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, he says that you did not do that either. You had better\r\nconfess that you took it and lashed it to shreds. I suppose poor Philip\r\nwill have to make good your mischief out of his own pocket." The footman\r\n(who looked a grave and honest man) seemed much put out by the affair,\r\nand determined to sift it to the bottom on Philip\'s behalf.\r\n\r\nOut of delicacy I pretended to notice nothing and turned aside, but the\r\nother footmen present gathered round and looked approvingly at the old\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n"Hm--well, I DID tear it in pieces," at length confessed Etienne,\r\nshrinking from further explanations. "However, I will pay for it. Did\r\nyou ever hear anything so absurd?" he added to me as he drew me towards\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"But excuse me, sir; HOW are you going to pay for it? I know your ways\r\nof paying. You have owed Maria Valericana twenty copecks these eight\r\nmonths now, and you have owed me something for two years, and Peter\r\nfor--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, will you!" shouted the young fellow, pale with rage,\r\n"I shall report you for this."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you may do so," said the footman. "Yet it is not fair, your\r\nhighness," he added, with a peculiar stress on the title, as he departed\r\nwith the ladies\' wraps to the cloak-room. We ourselves entered the\r\nsalon.\r\n\r\n"Quite right, footman," remarked someone approvingly from the ball\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma had a peculiar way of employing, now the second person\r\nsingular, now the second person plural, in order to indicate her opinion\r\nof people. When the young Prince Etienne went up to her she addressed\r\nhim as "YOU," and altogether looked at him with such an expression\r\nof contempt that, had I been in his place, I should have been utterly\r\ncrestfallen. Etienne, however, was evidently not a boy of that sort,\r\nfor he not only took no notice of her reception of him, but none of her\r\nperson either. In fact, he bowed to the company at large in a way which,\r\nthough not graceful, was at least free from embarrassment.\r\n\r\nSonetchka now claimed my whole attention. I remember that, as I stood\r\nin the salon with Etienne and Woloda, at a spot whence we could both\r\nsee and be seen by Sonetchka, I took great pleasure in talking very loud\r\n(and all my utterances seemed to me both bold and comical) and glancing\r\ntowards the door of the drawing-room, but that, as soon as ever we\r\nhappened to move to another spot whence we could neither see nor be seen\r\nby her, I became dumb, and thought the conversation had ceased to be\r\nenjoyable. The rooms were now full of people--among them (as at all\r\nchildren\'s parties) a number of elder children who wished to dance and\r\nenjoy themselves very much, but who pretended to do everything merely in\r\norder to give pleasure to the mistress of the house.\r\n\r\nWhen the Iwins arrived I found that, instead of being as delighted as\r\nusual to meet Seriosha, I felt a kind of vexation that he should see and\r\nbe seen by Sonetchka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI -- BEFORE THE MAZURKA\r\n\r\n"HULLO, Woloda! So we are going to dance to-night," said Seriosha,\r\nissuing from the drawing-room and taking out of his pocket a brand new\r\npair of gloves. "I suppose it IS necessary to put on gloves?"\r\n\r\n"Goodness! What shall I do? We have no gloves," I thought to myself.\r\n"I must go upstairs and search about." Yet though I rummaged in every\r\ndrawer, I only found, in one of them, my green travelling mittens, and,\r\nin another, a single lilac-coloured glove, a thing which could be of no\r\nuse to me, firstly, because it was very old and dirty, secondly, because\r\nit was much too large for me, and thirdly (and principally), because the\r\nmiddle finger was wanting--Karl having long ago cut it off to wear over\r\na sore nail.\r\n\r\nHowever, I put it on--not without some diffident contemplation of the\r\nblank left by the middle finger and of the ink-stained edges round the\r\nvacant space.\r\n\r\n"If only Natalia Savishna had been here," I reflected, "we should\r\ncertainly have found some gloves. I can\'t go downstairs in this\r\ncondition. Yet, if they ask me why I am not dancing, what am I to say?\r\nHowever, I can\'t remain here either, or they will be sending upstairs to\r\nfetch me. What on earth am I to do?" and I wrung my hands.\r\n\r\n"What are you up to here?" asked Woloda as he burst into the room. "Go\r\nand engage a partner. The dancing will be beginning directly."\r\n\r\n"Woloda," I said despairingly, as I showed him my hand with two fingers\r\nthrust into a single finger of the dirty glove, "Woloda, you, never\r\nthought of this."\r\n\r\n"Of what?" he said impatiently. "Oh, of gloves," he added with a\r\ncareless glance at my hand. "That\'s nothing. We can ask Grandmamma what\r\nshe thinks about it," and without further ado he departed downstairs. I\r\nfelt a trifle relieved by the coolness with which he had met a situation\r\nwhich seemed to me so grave, and hastened back to the drawing-room,\r\ncompletely forgetful of the unfortunate glove which still adorned my\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nCautiously approaching Grandmamma\'s arm-chair, I asked her in a whisper:\r\n\r\n"Grandmamma, what are we to do? We have no gloves."\r\n\r\n"What, my love?"\r\n\r\n"We have no gloves," I repeated, at the same time bending over towards\r\nher and laying both hands on the arm of her chair.\r\n\r\n"But what is that?" she cried as she caught hold of my left hand.\r\n"Look, my dear!" she continued, turning to Madame Valakhin. "See how\r\nsmart this young man has made himself to dance with your daughter!"\r\n\r\nAs Grandmamma persisted in retaining hold of my hand and gazing with a\r\nmock air of gravity and interrogation at all around her, curiosity was\r\nsoon aroused, and a general roar of laughter ensued.\r\n\r\nI should have been infuriated at the thought that Seriosha was present\r\nto see this, as I scowled with embarrassment and struggled hard to free\r\nmy hand, had it not been that somehow Sonetchka\'s laughter (and she was\r\nlaughing to such a degree that the tears were standing in her eyes\r\nand the curls dancing about her lovely face) took away my feeling\r\nof humiliation. I felt that her laughter was not satirical, but only\r\nnatural and free; so that, as we laughed together and looked at one\r\nanother, there seemed to begin a kind of sympathy between us. Instead\r\nof turning out badly, therefore, the episode of the glove served only\r\nto set me at my ease among the dreaded circle of guests, and to make\r\nme cease to feel oppressed with shyness. The sufferings of shy people\r\nproceed only from the doubts which they feel concerning the opinions\r\nof their fellows. No sooner are those opinions expressed (whether\r\nflattering or the reverse) than the agony disappears.\r\n\r\nHow lovely Sonetchka looked when she was dancing a quadrille as my\r\nvis-a-vis, with, as her partner, the loutish Prince Etienne! How\r\ncharmingly she smiled when, en chaine, she accorded me her hand! How\r\ngracefully the curls, around her head nodded to the rhythm, and how\r\nnaively she executed the jete assemble with her little feet!\r\n\r\nIn the fifth figure, when my partner had to leave me for the other\r\nside and I, counting the beats, was getting ready to dance my solo, she\r\npursed her lips gravely and looked in another direction; but her fears\r\nfor me were groundless. Boldly I performed the chasse en avant and\r\nchasse en arriere glissade, until, when it came to my turn to move\r\ntowards her and I, with a comic gesture, showed her the poor glove with\r\nits crumpled fingers, she laughed heartily, and seemed to move her tiny\r\nfeet more enchantingly than ever over the parquetted floor.\r\n\r\nHow well I remember how we formed the circle, and how, without\r\nwithdrawing her hand from mine, she scratched her little nose with\r\nher glove! All this I can see before me still. Still can I hear the\r\nquadrille from "The Maids of the Danube" to which we danced that night.\r\n\r\nThe second quadrille, I danced with Sonetchka herself; yet when we went\r\nto sit down together during the interval, I felt overcome with shyness\r\nand as though I had nothing to say. At last, when my silence had lasted\r\nso long that I began to be afraid that she would think me a stupid boy,\r\nI decided at all hazards to counteract such a notion.\r\n\r\n"Vous etes une habitante de Moscou?" I began, and, on receiving an\r\naffirmative answer, continued. "Et moi, je n\'ai encore jamais frequente\r\nla capitale" (with a particular emphasis on the word "frequente"). Yet I\r\nfelt that, brilliant though this introduction might be as evidence of my\r\nprofound knowledge of the French language, I could not long keep up the\r\nconversation in that manner. Our turn for dancing had not yet arrived,\r\nand silence again ensued between us. I kept looking anxiously at her in\r\nthe hope both of discerning what impression I had produced and of her\r\ncoming to my aid.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get that ridiculous glove of yours?" she asked me all of\r\na sudden, and the question afforded me immense satisfaction and relief.\r\nI replied that the glove belonged to Karl Ivanitch, and then went on\r\nto speak ironically of his appearance, and to describe how comical he\r\nlooked in his red cap, and how he and his green coat had once fallen\r\nplump off a horse into a pond.\r\n\r\nThe quadrille was soon over. Yet why had I spoken ironically of poor\r\nKarl Ivanitch? Should I, forsooth, have sunk in Sonetchka\'s esteem if,\r\non the contrary, I had spoken of him with the love and respect which I\r\nundoubtedly bore him?\r\n\r\nThe quadrille ended, Sonetchka said, "Thank you," with as lovely an\r\nexpression on her face as though I had really conferred, upon her a\r\nfavour. I was delighted. In fact I hardly knew myself for joy and could\r\nnot think whence I derived such case and confidence and even daring.\r\n\r\n"Nothing in the world can abash me now," I thought as I wandered\r\ncarelessly about the salon. "I am ready for anything."\r\n\r\nJust then Seriosha came and requested me to be his vis-a-vis.\r\n\r\n"Very well," I said. "I have no partner as yet, but I can soon find\r\none."\r\n\r\nGlancing round the salon with a confident eye, I saw that every lady was\r\nengaged save one--a tall girl standing near the drawing-room door. Yet a\r\ngrown-up young man was approaching her-probably for the same purpose as\r\nmyself! He was but two steps from her, while I was at the further end\r\nof the salon. Doing a glissade over the polished floor, I covered the\r\nintervening space, and in a brave, firm voice asked the favour of her\r\nhand in the quadrille. Smiling with a protecting air, the young lady\r\naccorded me her hand, and the tall young man was left without a partner.\r\nI felt so conscious of my strength that I paid no attention to his\r\nirritation, though I learnt later that he had asked somebody who the\r\nawkward, untidy boy was who, had taken away his lady from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII -- THE MAZURKA\r\n\r\nAFTERWARDS the same young man formed one of the first couple in a\r\nmazurka. He sprang to his feet, took his partner\'s hand, and then,\r\ninstead of executing the pas de Basques which Mimi had taught us, glided\r\nforward till he arrived at a corner of the room, stopped, divided his\r\nfeet, turned on his heels, and, with a spring, glided back again. I, who\r\nhad found no partner for this particular dance and was sitting on the\r\narm of Grandmamma\'s chair, thought to myself:\r\n\r\n"What on earth is he doing? That is not what Mimi taught us. And there\r\nare the Iwins and Etienne all dancing in the same way-without the pas de\r\nBasques! Ah! and there is Woloda too! He too is adopting the new style,\r\nand not so badly either. And there is Sonetchka, the lovely one! Yes,\r\nthere she comes!" I felt immensely happy at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe mazurka came to an end, and already some of the guests were saying\r\ngood-bye to Grandmamma. She was evidently tired, yet she assured them\r\nthat she felt vexed at their early departure. Servants were gliding\r\nabout with plates and trays among the dancers, and the musicians were\r\ncarelessly playing the same tune for about the thirteenth time in\r\nsuccession, when the young lady whom I had danced with before, and who\r\nwas just about to join in another mazurka, caught sight of me, and, with\r\na kindly smile, led me to Sonetchka. And one of the innumerable Kornakoff\r\nprincesses, at the same time asking me, "Rose or Hortie?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, so it\'s YOU!" said Grandmamma as she turned round in her armchair.\r\n"Go and dance, then, my boy."\r\n\r\nAlthough I would fain have taken refuge behind the armchair rather than\r\nleave its shelter, I could not refuse; so I got up, said, "Rose," and\r\nlooked at Sonetchka. Before I had time to realise it, however, a hand in\r\na white glove laid itself on mine, and the Kornakoff girl stepped forth\r\nwith a pleased smile and evidently no suspicion that I was ignorant of\r\nthe steps of the dance. I only knew that the pas de Basques (the only\r\nfigure of it which I had been taught) would be out of place. However,\r\nthe strains of the mazurka falling upon my ears, and imparting their\r\nusual impulse to my acoustic nerves (which, in their turn, imparted\r\ntheir usual impulse to my feet), I involuntarily, and to the amazement\r\nof the spectators, began executing on tiptoe the sole (and fatal) pas\r\nwhich I had been taught.\r\n\r\nSo long as we went straight ahead I kept fairly right, but when it came\r\nto turning I saw that I must make preparations to arrest my course.\r\nAccordingly, to avoid any appearance of awkwardness, I stopped short,\r\nwith the intention of imitating the "wheel about" which I had seen the\r\nyoung man perform so neatly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, just as I divided my feet and prepared to make a spring,\r\nthe Princess Kornakoff looked sharply round at my legs with such an\r\nexpression of stupefied amazement and curiosity that the glance undid\r\nme. Instead of continuing to dance, I remained moving my legs up and\r\ndown on the same spot, in a sort of extraordinary fashion which bore\r\nno relation whatever either to form or rhythm. At last I stopped\r\naltogether. Every-one was looking at me--some with curiosity, some with\r\nastonishment, some with disdain, and some with compassion, Grandmamma\r\nalone seemed unmoved.\r\n\r\n"You should not dance if you don\'t know the step," said Papa\'s angry\r\nvoice in my ear as, pushing me gently aside, he took my partner\'s hand,\r\ncompleted the figures with her to the admiration of every one, and\r\nfinally led her back to, her place. The mazurka was at an end.\r\n\r\nAh me! What had I done to be punished so heavily?\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n"Every one despises me, and will always despise me," I thought to\r\nmyself. "The way is closed for me to friendship, love, and fame! All,\r\nall is lost!"\r\n\r\nWhy had Woloda made signs to me which every one saw, yet which could in\r\nno way help me? Why had that disgusting princess looked at my legs? Why\r\nhad Sonetchka--she was a darling, of course!--yet why, oh why, had she\r\nsmiled at that moment?\r\n\r\nWhy had Papa turned red and taken my hand? Can it be that he was ashamed\r\nof me?\r\n\r\nOh, it was dreadful! Alas, if only Mamma had been there she would never\r\nhave blushed for her Nicolinka!\r\n\r\nHow on the instant that dear image led my imagination captive! I seemed\r\nto see once more the meadow before our house, the tall lime-trees in the\r\ngarden, the clear pond where the ducks swain, the blue sky dappled with\r\nwhite clouds, the sweet-smelling ricks of hay. How those memories--aye,\r\nand many another quiet, beloved recollection--floated through my mind at\r\nthat time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII -- AFTER THE MAZURKA\r\n\r\nAt supper the young man whom I have mentioned seated himself beside\r\nme at the children\'s table, and treated me with an amount of attention\r\nwhich would have flattered my self-esteem had I been able, after the\r\noccurrence just related, to give a thought to anything beyond my failure\r\nin the mazurka. However, the young man seemed determined to cheer me\r\nup. He jested, called me "old boy," and finally (since none of the\r\nelder folks were looking at us) began to help me to wine, first from one\r\nbottle and then from another and to force me to drink it off quickly.\r\n\r\nBy the time (towards the end of supper) that a servant had poured me out\r\na quarter of a glass of champagne, and the young man had straightway bid\r\nhim fill it up and urged me to drink the beverage off at a draught, I\r\nhad begun to feel a grateful warmth diffusing itself through my body.\r\nI also felt well-disposed towards my kind patron, and began to laugh\r\nheartily at everything. Suddenly the music of the Grosvater dance struck\r\nup, and every one rushed from the table. My friendship with the young\r\nman had now outlived its day; so, whereas he joined a group of the older\r\nfolks, I approached Madame Valakhin to hear what she and her daughter had\r\nto say to one another.\r\n\r\n"Just HALF-an-hour more?" Sonetchka was imploring her.\r\n\r\n"Impossible, my dearest."\r\n\r\n"Yet, only to please me--just this ONCE?" Sonetchka went on\r\npersuasively.\r\n\r\n"Well, what if I should be ill to-morrow through all this dissipation?"\r\nrejoined her mother, and was incautious enough to smile.\r\n\r\n"There! You DO consent, and we CAN stay after all!" exclaimed Sonetchka,\r\njumping for joy.\r\n\r\n"What is to be done with such a girl?" said Madame. "Well, run away and\r\ndance. See," she added on perceiving myself, "here is a cavalier ready\r\nwaiting for you."\r\n\r\nSonetchka gave me her hand, and we darted off to the salon. The wine,\r\nadded to Sonetchka\'s presence and gaiety, had at once made me forget\r\nall about the unfortunate end of the mazurka. I kept executing the most\r\nsplendid feats with my legs--now imitating a horse as he throws out his\r\nhoofs in the trot, now stamping like a sheep infuriated at a dog, and\r\nall the while laughing regardless of appearances.\r\n\r\nSonetchka also laughed unceasingly, whether we were whirling round in\r\na circle or whether we stood still to watch an old lady whose painful\r\nmovements with her feet showed the difficulty she had in walking.\r\nFinally Sonetchka nearly died of merriment when I jumped half-way to the\r\nceiling in proof of my skill.\r\n\r\nAs I passed a mirror in Grandmamma\'s boudoir and glanced at myself\r\nI could see that my face was all in a perspiration and my hair\r\ndishevelled--the top-knot, in particular, being more erect than ever.\r\nYet my general appearance looked so happy, healthy, and good-tempered\r\nthat I felt wholly pleased with myself.\r\n\r\n"If I were always as I am now," I thought, "I might yet be able to\r\nplease people with my looks." Yet as soon as I glanced at my partner\'s\r\nface again, and saw there not only the expression of happiness, health,\r\nand good temper which had just pleased me in my own, but also a fresh\r\nand enchanting beauty besides, I felt dissatisfied with myself again.\r\nI understood how silly of me it was to hope to attract the attention\r\nof such a wonderful being as Sonetchka. I could not hope for\r\nreciprocity--could not even think of it, yet my heart was overflowing\r\nwith happiness. I could not imagine that the feeling of love which was\r\nfilling my soul so pleasantly could require any happiness still greater,\r\nor wish for more than that that happiness should never cease. I felt\r\nperfectly contented. My heart beat like that of a dove, with the blood\r\nconstantly flowing back to it, and I almost wept for joy.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through the hall and peered into a little dark store-room\r\nbeneath the staircase I thought: "What bliss it would be if I could pass\r\nthe rest of my life with her in that dark corner, and never let anybody\r\nknow that we were there!"\r\n\r\n"It HAS been a delightful evening, hasn\'t it?" I asked her in a low,\r\ntremulous voice. Then I quickened my steps--as much out of fear of what\r\nI had said as out of fear of what I had meant to imply.\r\n\r\n"Yes, VERY!" she answered, and turned her face to look at me with an\r\nexpression so kind that I ceased to be afraid. I went on:\r\n\r\n"Particularly since supper. Yet if you could only know how I regret" (I\r\nhad nearly said) "how miserable I am at your going, and to think that\r\nwe shall see each other no more!"\r\n\r\n"But why SHOULDN\'T we?" she asked, looking gravely at the corner of\r\nher pocket-handkerchief, and gliding her fingers over a latticed screen\r\nwhich we were passing. "Every Tuesday and Friday I go with Mamma to the\r\nIverskoi Prospect. I suppose you go for walks too sometimes?"\r\n\r\n"Well, certainly I shall ask to go for one next Tuesday, and, if they\r\nwon\'t take me I shall go by myself--even without my hat, if necessary. I\r\nknow the way all right."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I have just thought of?" she went on. "You know, I\r\ncall some of the boys who come to see us THOU. Shall you and I call each\r\nother THOU too? Wilt THOU?" she added, bending her head towards me and\r\nlooking me straight in the eyes.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a more lively section of the Grosvater dance began.\r\n\r\n"Give me your hand," I said, under the impression that the music and din\r\nwould drown my exact words, but she smilingly replied, "THY hand, not\r\nYOUR hand." Yet the dance was over before I had succeeded in saying\r\nTHOU, even though I kept conning over phrases in which the pronoun could\r\nbe employed--and employed more than once. All that I wanted was the\r\ncourage to say it.\r\n\r\n"Wilt THOU?" and "THY hand" sounded continually in my ears, and caused\r\nin me a kind of intoxication I could hear and see nothing but Sonetchka.\r\nI watched her mother take her curls, lay them flat behind her ears (thus\r\ndisclosing portions of her forehead and temples which I had not yet\r\nseen), and wrap her up so completely in the green shawl that nothing was\r\nleft visible but the tip of her nose. Indeed, I could see that, if her\r\nlittle rosy fingers had not made a small, opening near her mouth, she\r\nwould have been unable to breathe. Finally I saw her leave her mother\'s\r\narm for an instant on the staircase, and turn and nod to us quickly\r\nbefore she disappeared through the doorway.\r\n\r\nWoloda, the Iwins, the young Prince Etienne, and myself were all of us\r\nin love with Sonetchka and all of us standing on the staircase to follow\r\nher with our eyes. To whom in particular she had nodded I do not know,\r\nbut at the moment I firmly believed it to be myself. In taking leave\r\nof the Iwins, I spoke quite unconcernedly, and even coldly, to Seriosha\r\nbefore I finally shook hands with him. Though he tried to appear\r\nabsolutely indifferent, I think that he understood that from that day\r\nforth he had lost both my affection and his power over me, as well as\r\nthat he regretted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV -- IN BED\r\n\r\n"How could I have managed to be so long and so passionately devoted to\r\nSeriosha?" I asked myself as I lay in bed that night. "He never either\r\nunderstood, appreciated, or deserved my love. But Sonetchka! What a\r\ndarling SHE is! \'Wilt THOU?\'--\'THY hand\'!"\r\n\r\nI crept closer to the pillows, imagined to myself her lovely face,\r\ncovered my head over with the bedclothes, tucked the counterpane in on\r\nall sides, and, thus snugly covered, lay quiet and enjoying the warmth\r\nuntil I became wholly absorbed in pleasant fancies and reminiscences.\r\n\r\nIf I stared fixedly at the inside of the sheet above me I found that I\r\ncould see her as clearly as I had done an hour ago could talk to her in\r\nmy thoughts, and, though it was a conversation of irrational tenor, I\r\nderived the greatest delight from it, seeing that "THOU" and "THINE" and\r\n"for THEE" and "to THEE" occurred in it incessantly. These fancies were\r\nso vivid that I could not sleep for the sweetness of my emotion, and\r\nfelt as though I must communicate my superabundant happiness to some\r\none.\r\n\r\n"The darling!" I said, half-aloud, as I turned over; then, "Woloda, are\r\nyou asleep?"\r\n\r\n"No," he replied in a sleepy voice. "What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I am in love, Woloda--terribly in love with Sonetchka"\r\n\r\n"Well? Anything else?" he replied, stretching himself.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you cannot imagine what I feel just now, as I lay covered over\r\nwith the counterpane, I could see her and talk to her so clearly that\r\nit was marvellous! And, do you know, while I was lying thinking about\r\nher--I don\'t know why it was, but all at once I felt so sad that I could\r\nhave cried."\r\n\r\nWoloda made a movement of some sort.\r\n\r\n"One thing only I wish for," I continued; "and that is that I could\r\nalways be with her and always be seeing her. Just that. You are in love\r\ntoo, I believe. Confess that you are."\r\n\r\nIt was strange, but somehow I wanted every one to be in love with\r\nSonetchka, and every one to tell me that they were so.\r\n\r\n"So that\'s how it is with you? " said Woloda, turning round to me.\r\n"Well, I can understand it."\r\n\r\n"I can see that you cannot sleep," I remarked, observing by his bright\r\neyes that he was anything but drowsy. "Well, cover yourself over SO"\r\n(and I pulled the bedclothes over him), "and then let us talk about her.\r\nIsn\'t she splendid? If she were to say to me, \'Nicolinka, jump out of\r\nthe window,\' or \'jump into the fire,\' I should say, \'Yes, I will do it\r\nat once and rejoice in doing it.\' Oh, how glorious she is!"\r\n\r\nI went on picturing her again and again to my imagination, and, to enjoy\r\nthe vision the better, turned over on my side and buried my head in the\r\npillows, murmuring, "Oh, I want to cry, Woloda."\r\n\r\n"What a fool you are!" he said with a slight laugh. Then, after a\r\nmoment\'s silence he added: "I am not like you. I think I would rather\r\nsit and talk with her."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Then you ARE in love with her!" I interrupted.\r\n\r\n"And then," went on Woloda, smiling tenderly, "kiss her fingers and eyes\r\nand lips and nose and feet--kiss all of her."\r\n\r\n"How absurd!" I exclaimed from beneath the pillows.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you don\'t understand things," said Woloda with contempt.\r\n\r\n"I DO understand. It\'s you who don\'t understand things, and you talk\r\nrubbish, too," I replied, half-crying.\r\n\r\n"Well, there is nothing to cry about," he concluded. "She is only a\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV -- THE LETTER\r\n\r\nON the 16th of April, nearly six months after the day just described,\r\nPapa entered our schoolroom and told us that that night we must start\r\nwith him for our country house. I felt a pang at my heart when I heard\r\nthe news, and my thoughts at once turned to Mamma. The cause of our\r\nunexpected departure was the following letter:\r\n\r\n"PETROVSKOE, 12th April.\r\n\r\n"Only this moment (i.e. at ten o\'clock in the evening) have I received\r\nyour dear letter of the 3rd of April, but as usual, I answer it at once.\r\nFedor brought it yesterday from town, but, as it was late, he did not\r\ngive it to Mimi till this morning, and Mimi (since I was unwell) kept\r\nit from me all day. I have been a little feverish. In fact, to tell the\r\ntruth, this is the fourth day that I have been in bed.\r\n\r\n"Yet do not be uneasy. I feel almost myself again now, and if Ivan\r\nVassilitch should allow me, I think of getting up to-morrow.\r\n\r\n"On Friday last I took the girls for a drive, and, close to the little\r\nbridge by the turning on to the high road (the place which always makes\r\nme nervous), the horses and carriage stuck fast in the mud. Well, the\r\nday being fine, I thought that we would walk a little up the road until\r\nthe carriage should be extricated, but no sooner had we reached the\r\nchapel than I felt obliged to sit down, I was so tired, and in this way\r\nhalf-an-hour passed while help was being sent for to get the carriage\r\ndug out. I felt cold, for I had only thin boots on, and they had been\r\nwet through. After luncheon too, I had alternate cold and hot fits, yet\r\nstill continued to follow our ordinary routine.\r\n\r\n"When tea was over I sat down to the piano to play a duct with\r\nLubotshka, (you would be astonished to hear what progress she has\r\nmade!), but imagine my surprise when I found that I could not count the\r\nbeats! Several times I began to do so, yet always felt confused in\r\nmy head, and kept hearing strange noises in my ears. I would begin\r\n\'One-two-three--\' and then suddenly go on \'-eight-fifteen,\' and so on,\r\nas though I were talking nonsense and could not help it. At last Mimi\r\ncame to my assistance and forced me to retire to bed. That was how my\r\nillness began, and it was all through my own fault. The next day I had\r\na good deal of fever, and our good Ivan Vassilitch came. He has not left\r\nus since, but promises soon to restore me to the world.\r\n\r\n"What a wonderful old man he is! While I was feverish and delirious he\r\nsat the whole night by my bedside without once closing his eyes; and at\r\nthis moment (since he knows I am busy writing) he is with the girls in\r\nthe divannaia, and I can hear him telling them German stories, and them\r\nlaughing as they listen to him.\r\n\r\n"\'La Belle Flamande,\' as you call her, is now spending her second week\r\nhere as my guest (her mother having gone to pay a visit somewhere), and\r\nshe is most attentive and attached to me. She even tells me her secret\r\naffairs. Under different circumstances her beautiful face, good temper,\r\nand youth might have made a most excellent girl of her, but in the\r\nsociety in which according to her own account, she moves she will be\r\nwasted. The idea has more than once occurred to me that, had I not had\r\nso many children of my own, it would have been a deed of mercy to have\r\nadopted her.\r\n\r\n"Lubotshka had meant to write to you herself, but she has torn up three\r\nsheets of paper, saying: \'I know what a quizzer Papa always is. If he\r\nwere to find a single fault in my letter he would show it to everybody.\'\r\nKatenka is as charming as usual, and Mimi, too, is good, but tiresome.\r\n\r\n"Now let me speak of more serious matters. You write to me that your\r\naffairs are not going well this winter, and that you wish to break into\r\nthe revenues of Chabarovska. It seems to me strange that you should\r\nthink it necessary to ask my consent. Surely what belongs to me belongs\r\nno less to you? You are so kind-hearted, dear, that, for fear of\r\nworrying me, you conceal the real state of things, but I can guess that\r\nyou have lost a great deal at cards, as also that you are afraid of my\r\nbeing angry at that. Yet, so long as you can tide over this crisis, I\r\nshall not think much of it, and you need not be uneasy, I have grown\r\naccustomed to no longer relying, so far as the children are concerned,\r\nupon your gains at play, nor yet--excuse me for saying so--upon your\r\nincome. Therefore your losses cause me as little anxiety as your gains\r\ngive me pleasure. What I really grieve over is your unhappy passion\r\nitself for gambling--a passion which bereaves me of part of your tender\r\naffection and obliges me to tell you such bitter truths as (God knows\r\nwith what pain) I am now telling you. I never cease to beseech Him that\r\nHe may preserve us, not from poverty (for what is poverty?), but from\r\nthe terrible juncture which would arise should the interests of the\r\nchildren, which I am called upon to protect, ever come into collision\r\nwith our own. Hitherto God has listened to my prayers. You have never\r\nyet overstepped the limit beyond which we should be obliged either\r\nto sacrifice property which would no longer belong to us, but to the\r\nchildren, or--It is terrible to think of, but the dreadful misfortune\r\nat which I hint is forever hanging over our heads. Yes, it is the heavy\r\ncross which God has given us both to carry.\r\n\r\n"Also, you write about the children, and come back to our old point\r\nof difference by asking my consent to your placing them at a\r\nboarding-school. You know my objection to that kind of education. I\r\ndo not know, dear, whether you will accede to my request, but I\r\nnevertheless beseech you, by your love for me, to give me your promise\r\nthat never so long as I am alive, nor yet after my death (if God should\r\nsee fit to separate us), shall such a thing be done.\r\n\r\n"Also you write that our affairs render it indispensable for you to\r\nvisit St. Petersburg. The Lord go with you! Go and return as, soon as\r\npossible. Without you we shall all of us be lonely.\r\n\r\n"Spring is coming in beautifully. We keep the door on to the terrace\r\nalways open now, while the path to the orangery is dry and the\r\npeach-trees are in full blossom. Only here and there is there a little\r\nsnow remaining. The swallows are arriving, and to-day Lubotshka brought\r\nme the first flowers. The doctor says that in about three days\' time I\r\nshall be well again and able to take the open air and to enjoy the April\r\nsun. Now, au revoir, my dearest one. Do not be alarmed, I beg of you,\r\neither on account of my illness or on account of your losses at play.\r\nEnd the crisis as soon as possible, and then return here with the\r\nchildren for the summer. I am making wonderful plans for our passing of\r\nit, and I only need your presence to realise them."\r\n\r\nThe rest of the letter was written in French, as well as in a strange,\r\nuncertain hand, on another piece of paper. I transcribe it word for\r\nword:\r\n\r\n"Do not believe what I have just written to you about my illness. It is\r\nmore serious than any one knows. I alone know that I shall never leave\r\nmy bed again. Do not, therefore, delay a minute in coming here with the\r\nchildren. Perhaps it may yet be permitted me to embrace and bless them.\r\nIt is my last wish that it should be so. I know what a terrible blow\r\nthis will be to you, but you would have had to hear it sooner or\r\nlater--if not from me, at least from others. Let us try to, bear the\r\nCalamity with fortitude, and place our trust in the mercy of God. Let\r\nus submit ourselves to His will. Do not think that what I am writing is\r\nsome delusion of my sick imagination. On the contrary, I am perfectly\r\nclear at this moment, and absolutely calm. Nor must you comfort yourself\r\nwith the false hope that these are the unreal, confused feelings of a\r\ndespondent spirit, for I feel indeed, I know, since God has deigned to\r\nreveal it to me--that I have now but a very short time to live. Will my\r\nlove for you and the children cease with my life? I know that that can\r\nnever be. At this moment I am too full of that love to be capable of\r\nbelieving that such a feeling (which constitutes a part of my very\r\nexistence) can ever, perish. My soul can never lack its love for you;\r\nand I know that that love will exist for ever, since such a feeling\r\ncould never have been awakened if it were not to be eternal. I shall no\r\nlonger be with you, yet I firmly believe that my love will cleave to\r\nyou always, and from that thought I glean such comfort that I await the\r\napproach of death calmly and without fear. Yes, I am calm, and God knows\r\nthat I have ever looked, and do look now, upon death as no more than the\r\npassage to a better life. Yet why do tears blind my eyes? Why should the\r\nchildren lose a mother\'s love? Why must you, my husband, experience such\r\na heavy and unlooked-for blow? Why must I die when your love was making\r\nlife so inexpressibly happy for me?\r\n\r\n"But His holy will be done!\r\n\r\n"The tears prevent my writing more. It may be that I shall never see you\r\nagain. I thank you, my darling beyond all price, for all the felicity\r\nwith which you have surrounded me in this life. Soon I shall appear\r\nbefore God Himself to pray that He may reward you. Farewell, my dearest!\r\nRemember that, if I am no longer here, my love will none the less NEVER\r\nAND NOWHERE fail you. Farewell, Woloda--farewell, my pet! Farewell, my\r\nBenjamin, my little Nicolinka! Surely they will never forget me?"\r\n\r\nWith this letter had come also a French note from Mimi, in which the\r\nlatter said:\r\n\r\n"The sad circumstances of which she has written to you are but too\r\nsurely confirmed by the words of the doctor. Yesterday evening she\r\nordered the letter to be posted at once, but, thinking at she did so in\r\ndelirium, I waited until this morning, with the intention of sealing and\r\nsending it then. Hardly had I done so when Natalia Nicolaevna asked\r\nme what I had done with the letter and told me to burn it if not yet\r\ndespatched. She is forever speaking of it, and saying that it will kill\r\nyou. Do not delay your departure for an instant if you wish to see the\r\nangel before she leaves us. Pray excuse this scribble, but I have not\r\nslept now for three nights. You know how much I love her."\r\n\r\nLater I heard from Natalia Savishna (who passed the whole of the night\r\nof the 11th April at Mamma\'s bedside) that, after writing the first part\r\nof the letter, Mamma laid it down upon the table beside her and went to\r\nsleep for a while.\r\n\r\n"I confess," said Natalia Savishna, "that I too fell asleep in the\r\narm-chair, and let my knitting slip from my hands. Suddenly, towards one\r\no\'clock in the morning, I heard her saying something; whereupon I opened\r\nmy eyes and looked at her. My darling was sitting up in bed, with her\r\nhands clasped together and streams of tears gushing from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"\'It is all over now,\' she said, and hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n"I sprang to my feet, and asked what the matter was.\r\n\r\n"\'Ah, Natalia Savishna, if you could only know what I have just\r\nseen!\' she said; yet, for all my asking, she would say no more,\r\nbeyond commanding me to hand her the letter. To that letter she added\r\nsomething, and then said that it must be sent off directly. From that\r\nmoment she grew, rapidly worse."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI -- WHAT AWAITED US AT THE COUNTRY-HOUSE\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April we descended from the carriage at the front door\r\nof the house at Petrovskoe. All the way from Moscow Papa had been\r\npreoccupied, and when Woloda had asked him "whether Mamma was ill" he\r\nhad looked at him sadly and nodded an affirmative. Nevertheless he had\r\ngrown more composed during the journey, and it was only when we were\r\nactually approaching the house that his face again began to grow\r\nanxious, until, as he leaped from the carriage and asked Foka (who\r\nhad run breathlessly to meet us), "How is Natalia Nicolaevna now?" his\r\nvoice, was trembling, and his eyes had filled with tears. The good, old\r\nFoka looked at us, and then lowered his gaze again. Finally he said as\r\nhe opened the hall-door and turned his head aside: "It is the sixth day\r\nsince she has not left her bed."\r\n\r\nMilka (who, as we afterwards learned, had never ceased to whine from the\r\nday when Mamma was taken ill) came leaping, joyfully to meet Papa, and\r\nbarking a welcome as she licked his hands, but Papa put her aside, and\r\nwent first to the drawing-room, and then into the divannaia, from which\r\na door led into the bedroom. The nearer he approached the latter, the\r\nmore, did his movements express the agitation that he felt. Entering the\r\ndivannaia he crossed it on tiptoe, seeming to hold his breath. Even then\r\nhe had to stop and make the sign of the cross before he could summon up\r\ncourage to turn the handle. At the same moment Mimi, with dishevelled\r\nhair and eyes red with weeping came hastily out of the corridor.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Peter Alexandritch!" she said in a whisper and with a marked\r\nexpression of despair. Then, observing that Papa was trying to open the\r\ndoor, she whispered again:\r\n\r\n"Not here. This door is locked. Go round to the door on the other side."\r\n\r\nOh, how terribly all this wrought upon my imagination, racked as it was\r\nby grief and terrible forebodings!\r\n\r\nSo we went round to the other side. In the corridor we met the gardener,\r\nAkim, who had been wont to amuse us with his grimaces, but at this\r\nmoment I could see nothing comical in him. Indeed, the sight of his\r\nthoughtless, indifferent face struck me more painfully than anything\r\nelse. In the maidservants\' hall, through which we had to pass, two maids\r\nwere sitting at their work, but rose to salute us with an expression so\r\nmournful that I felt completely overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nPassing also through Mimi\'s room, Papa opened the door of the bedroom,\r\nand we entered. The two windows on the right were curtained over, and\r\nclose to them was seated, Natalia Savishna, spectacles on nose and\r\nengaged in darning stockings. She did not approach us to kiss me as she\r\nhad been used to do, but just rose and looked at us, her tears beginning\r\nto flow afresh. Somehow it frightened me to see every one, on beholding\r\nus, begin to cry, although they had been calm enough before.\r\n\r\nOn the left stood the bed behind a screen, while in the great arm-chair\r\nthe doctor lay asleep. Beside the bed a young, fair-haired and\r\nremarkably beautiful girl in a white morning wrapper was applying ice to\r\nMamma\'s head, but Mamma herself I could not see. This girl was "La\r\nBelle Flamande" of whom Mamma had written, and who afterwards played so\r\nimportant a part in our family life. As we entered she disengaged one\r\nof her hands, straightened the pleats of her dress on her bosom, and\r\nwhispered, "She is insensible." Though I was in an agony of grief, I\r\nobserved at that moment every little detail.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark in the room, and very hot, while the air was heavy\r\nwith the mingled, scent of mint, eau-de-cologne, camomile, and Hoffman\'s\r\npastilles. The latter ingredient caught my attention so strongly that\r\neven now I can never hear of it, or even think of it, without my memory\r\ncarrying me back to that dark, close room, and all the details of that\r\ndreadful time.\r\n\r\nMamma\'s eyes were wide open, but they could not see us. Never shall I\r\nforget the terrible expression in them--the expression of agonies of\r\nsuffering!\r\n\r\nThen we were taken away.\r\n\r\nWhen, later, I was able to ask Natalia Savishna about Mamma\'s last\r\nmoments she told me the following:\r\n\r\n"After you were taken out of the room, my beloved one struggled for a\r\nlong time, as though some one were trying to strangle her. Then at last\r\nshe laid her head back upon the pillow, and slept softly, peacefully,\r\nlike an angel from Heaven. I went away for a moment to see about her\r\nmedicine, and just as I entered the room again my darling was throwing\r\nthe bedclothes from off her and calling for your Papa. He stooped over\r\nher, but strength failed her to say what she wanted to. All she could\r\ndo was to open her lips and gasp, \'My God, my God! The children, the\r\nchildren!\' I would have run to fetch you, but Ivan Vassilitch stopped\r\nme, saying that it would only excite her--it were best not to do so.\r\nThen suddenly she stretched her arms out and dropped them again. What\r\nshe meant by that gesture the good God alone knows, but I think that in\r\nit she was blessing you--you the children whom she could not see. God\r\ndid not grant her to see her little ones before her death. Then she\r\nraised herself up--did my love, my darling--yes, just so with her hands,\r\nand exclaimed in a voice which I cannot bear to remember, \'Mother of\r\nGod, never forsake them!\'"\r\n\r\n"Then the pain mounted to her heart, and from her eyes it as, plain that\r\nshe suffered terribly, my poor one! She sank back upon the pillows, tore\r\nthe bedclothes with her teeth, and wept--wept--"\r\n\r\n"Yes and what then?" I asked but Natalia Savishna could say no more. She\r\nturned away and cried bitterly.\r\n\r\nMamma had expired in terrible agonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII -- GRIEF\r\n\r\nLATE the following evening I thought I would like to look at her once\r\nmore; so, conquering an involuntary sense of fear, I gently opened the\r\ndoor of the salon and entered on tiptoe.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room, on a table, lay the coffin, with wax candles\r\nburning all round it on tall silver candelabra. In the further corner\r\nsat the chanter, reading the Psalms in a low, monotonous voice. I\r\nstopped at the door and tried to look, but my eyes were so weak with\r\ncrying, and my nerves so terribly on edge, that I could distinguish\r\nnothing. Every object seemed to mingle together in a strange blur--the\r\ncandles, the brocade, the velvet, the great candelabra, the pink satin\r\ncushion trimmed with lace, the chaplet of flowers, the ribboned cap, and\r\nsomething of a transparent, wax-like colour. I mounted a chair to see\r\nher face, yet where it should have been I could see only that wax-like,\r\ntransparent something. I could not believe it to be her face. Yet, as\r\nI stood grazing at it, I at last recognised the well-known, beloved\r\nfeatures. I shuddered with horror to realise that it WAS she. Why were\r\nthose eyes so sunken? What had laid that dreadful paleness upon her\r\ncheeks, and stamped the black spot beneath the transparent skin on one\r\nof them? Why was the expression of the whole face so cold and severe?\r\nWhy were the lips so white, and their outline so beautiful, so majestic,\r\nso expressive of an unnatural calm that, as I looked at them, a chill\r\nshudder ran through my hair and down my back?\r\n\r\nSomehow, as I gazed, an irrepressible, incomprehensible power seemed\r\nto compel me to keep my eyes fixed upon that lifeless face. I could not\r\nturn away, and my imagination began to picture before me scenes of her\r\nactive life and happiness. I forgot that the corpse lying before me\r\nnow--the THING at which I was gazing unconsciously as at an object which\r\nhad nothing in common with my dreams--was SHE. I fancied I could\r\nsee her--now here, now there, alive, happy, and smiling. Then some\r\nwell-known feature in the face at which I was gazing would suddenly\r\narrest my attention, and in a flash I would recall the terrible reality\r\nand shudder-though still unable to turn my eyes away.\r\n\r\nThen again the dreams would replace reality--then again the reality put\r\nto flight the dreams. At last the consciousness of both left me, and for\r\na while I became insensible.\r\n\r\nHow long I remained in that condition I do not know, nor yet how it\r\noccurred. I only know that for a time I lost all sense of existence, and\r\nexperienced a kind of vague blissfulness which though grand and sweet,\r\nwas also sad. It may be that, as it ascended to a better world, her\r\nbeautiful soul had looked down with longing at the world in which she\r\nhad left us--that it had seen my sorrow, and, pitying me, had returned\r\nto earth on the wings of love to console and bless me with a heavenly\r\nsmile of compassion.\r\n\r\nThe door creaked as the chanter entered who was to relieve his\r\npredecessor. The noise awakened me, and my first thought was that,\r\nseeing me standing on the chair in a posture which had nothing touching\r\nin its aspect, he might take me for an unfeeling boy who had climbed\r\non to the chair out of mere curiosity: wherefore I hastened to make the\r\nsign of the cross, to bend down my head, and to burst out crying. As I\r\nrecall now my impressions of that episode I find that it was only during\r\nmy moments of self-forgetfulness that my grief was wholehearted. True,\r\nboth before and after the funeral I never ceased to cry and to look\r\nmiserable, yet I feel conscience-stricken when I recall that grief\r\nof mine, seeing that always present in it there was an element of\r\nconceit--of a desire to show that I was more grieved than any one else,\r\nof an interest which I took in observing the effect, produced upon\r\nothers by my tears, and of an idle curiosity leading me to remark\r\nMimi\'s bonnet and the faces of all present. The mere circumstance that\r\nI despised myself for not feeling grief to the exclusion of everything\r\nelse, and that I endeavoured to conceal the fact, shows that my sadness\r\nwas insincere and unnatural. I took a delight in feeling that I was\r\nunhappy, and in trying to feel more so. Consequently this egotistic\r\nconsciousness completely annulled any element of sincerity in my woe.\r\n\r\nThat night I slept calmly and soundly (as is usual after any great\r\nemotion), and awoke with my tears dried and my nerves restored. At ten\r\no\'clock we were summoned to attend the pre-funeral requiem.\r\n\r\nThe room was full of weeping servants and peasants who had come to bid\r\nfarewell to their late mistress. During the service I myself wept\r\na great deal, made frequent signs of the cross, and performed many\r\ngenuflections, but I did not pray with, my soul, and felt, if anything,\r\nalmost indifferent. My thoughts were chiefly centred upon the new coat\r\nwhich I was wearing (a garment which was tight and uncomfortable) and\r\nupon how to avoid soiling my trousers at the knees. Also I took the most\r\nminute notice of all present.\r\n\r\nPapa stood at the head of the coffin. He was as white as snow, and\r\nonly with difficulty restrained his tears. His tall figure in its black\r\nfrockcoat, his pale, expressive face, the graceful, assured manner in\r\nwhich, as usual, he made the sign of the cross or bowed until he touched\r\nthe floor with his hand [A custom of the Greek funeral rite.] or took\r\nthe candle from the priest or went to the coffin--all were exceedingly\r\neffective; yet for some reason or another I felt a grudge against him\r\nfor that very ability to appear effective at such a moment. Mimi stood\r\nleaning against the wall as though scarcely able to support herself. Her\r\ndress was all awry and covered with feathers, and her cap cocked to one\r\nside, while her eyes were red with weeping, her legs trembling under\r\nher, and she sobbed incessantly in a heartrending manner as ever and\r\nagain she buried her face in her handkerchief or her hands. I imagine\r\nthat she did this to check her continual sobbing without being seen by\r\nthe spectators. I remember, too, her telling Papa, the evening before,\r\nthat Mamma\'s death had come upon her as a blow from which she could\r\nnever hope to recover; that with Mamma she had lost everything; but that\r\n"the angel," as she called my mother, had not forgotten her when at the\r\npoint of death, since she had declared her wish to render her (Mimi\'s)\r\nand Katenka\'s fortunes secure for ever. Mimi had shed bitter tears\r\nwhile relating this, and very likely her sorrow, if not wholly pure and\r\ndisinterested, was in the main sincere. Lubotshka, in black garments\r\nand suffused with tears, stood with her head bowed upon her breast. She\r\nrarely looked at the coffin, yet whenever she did so her face expressed\r\na sort of childish fear. Katenka stood near her mother, and, despite\r\nher lengthened face, looked as lovely as ever. Woloda\'s frank nature\r\nwas frank also in grief. He stood looking grave and as though he were\r\nstaring at some object with fixed eyes. Then suddenly his lips would\r\nbegin to quiver, and he would hastily make the sign of the cross, and\r\nbend his head again.\r\n\r\nSuch of those present as were strangers I found intolerable. In fact,\r\nthe phrases of condolence with which they addressed Papa (such, for\r\ninstance, as that "she is better off now" "she was too good for this\r\nworld," and so on) awakened in me something like fury. What right had\r\nthey to weep over or to talk about her? Some of them, in referring to\r\nourselves, called us "orphans"--just as though it were not a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that children who have lost their mother are known as\r\norphans! Probably (I thought) they liked to be the first to give us that\r\nname, just as some people find pleasure in being the first to address a\r\nnewly-married girl as "Madame."\r\n\r\nIn a far corner of the room, and almost hidden by the open door, of the\r\ndining-room, stood a grey old woman with bent knees. With hands clasped\r\ntogether and eyes lifted to heaven, she prayed only--not wept. Her soul\r\nwas in the presence of God, and she was asking Him soon to reunite her\r\nto her whom she had loved beyond all beings on this earth, and whom she\r\nsteadfastly believed that she would very soon meet again.\r\n\r\n"There stands one who SINCERELY loved her," I thought to myself, and\r\nfelt ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe requiem was over. They uncovered the face of the deceased, and all\r\npresent except ourselves went to the coffin to give her the kiss of\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nOne of the last to take leave of her departed mistress was a peasant\r\nwoman who was holding by the hand a pretty little girl of five whom she\r\nhad brought with her, God knows for what reason. Just at a moment when\r\nI chanced to drop my wet handkerchief and was stooping to pick it up\r\nagain, a loud, piercing scream startled me, and filled me with such\r\nterror that, were I to live a hundred years more, I should never forget\r\nit. Even now the recollection always sends a cold shudder through my\r\nframe. I raised my head. Standing on the chair near the coffin was the\r\npeasant woman, while struggling and fighting in her arms was the\r\nlittle girl, and it was this same poor child who had screamed with such\r\ndreadful, desperate frenzy as, straining her terrified face away, she\r\nstill, continued to gaze with dilated eyes at the face of the corpse.\r\nI too screamed in a voice perhaps more dreadful still, and ran headlong\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\nOnly now did I understand the source of the strong, oppressive smell\r\nwhich, mingling with the scent of the incense, filled the chamber, while\r\nthe thought that the face which, but a few days ago, had been full of\r\nfreshness and beauty--the face which I loved more than anything else in\r\nall the world--was now capable of inspiring horror at length revealed to\r\nme, as though for the first time, the terrible truth, and filled my soul\r\nwith despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII -- SAD RECOLLECTIONS\r\n\r\nMamma was no longer with us, but our life went on as usual. We went\r\nto bed and got up at the same times and in the same rooms; breakfast,\r\nluncheon, and supper continued to be at their usual hours; everything\r\nremained standing in its accustomed place; nothing in the house or in\r\nour mode of life was altered: only, she was not there.\r\n\r\nYet it seemed to me as though such a misfortune ought to have changed\r\neverything. Our old mode of life appeared like an insult to her memory.\r\nIt recalled too vividly her presence.\r\n\r\nThe day before the funeral I felt as though I should like to rest a\r\nlittle after luncheon, and accordingly went to Natalia Savishna\'s room\r\nwith the intention of installing myself comfortably under the warm, soft\r\ndown of the quilt on her bed. When I entered I found Natalia herself\r\nlying on the bed and apparently asleep, but, on hearing my footsteps,\r\nshe raised herself up, removed the handkerchief which had been\r\nprotecting her face from the flies, and, adjusting her cap, sat forward\r\non the edge of the bed. Since it frequently happened that I came to lie\r\ndown in her room, she guessed my errand at once, and said:\r\n\r\n"So you have come to rest here a little, have you? Lie down, then, my\r\ndearest."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but what is the matter with you, Natalia Savishna?" I exclaimed\r\nas I forced her back again. "I did not come for that. No, you are tired\r\nyourself, so you LIE down."\r\n\r\n"I am quite rested now, darling," she said (though I knew that it was\r\nmany a night since she had closed her eyes). "Yes, I am indeed, and have\r\nno wish to sleep again," she added with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nI felt as though I wanted to speak to her of our misfortune, since I\r\nknew her sincerity and love, and thought that it would be a consolation\r\nto me to weep with her.\r\n\r\n"Natalia Savishna," I said after a pause, as I seated myself upon the\r\nbed, "who would ever have thought of this?"\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked at me with astonishment, for she did not quite\r\nunderstand my question.\r\n\r\n"Yes, who would ever have thought of it?" I repeated.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my darling," she said with a glance of tender compassion, "it is\r\nnot only \'Who would ever have thought of it?\' but \'Who, even now, would\r\never believe it?\' I am old, and my bones should long ago have gone to\r\nrest rather than that I should have lived to see the old master, your\r\nGrandpapa, of blessed memory, and Prince Nicola Michaelovitch, and his\r\ntwo brothers, and your sister Amenka all buried before me, though all\r\nyounger than myself--and now my darling, to my never-ending sorrow, gone\r\nhome before me! Yet it has been God\'s will. He took her away because she\r\nwas worthy to be taken, and because He has need of the good ones."\r\n\r\nThis simple thought seemed to me a consolation, and I pressed closer to\r\nNatalia. She laid her hands upon my head as she looked upward with eyes\r\nexpressive of a deep, but resigned, sorrow. In her soul was a sure and\r\ncertain hope that God would not long separate her from the one upon whom\r\nthe whole strength of her love had for many years been concentrated.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," she went on, "it is a long time now since I used to\r\nnurse and fondle her, and she used to call me Natasha. She used to come\r\njumping upon me, and caressing and kissing me, and say, \'MY Nashik, MY\r\ndarling, MY ducky,\' and I used to answer jokingly, \'Well, my love, I\r\ndon\'t believe that you DO love me. You will be a grown-up young\r\nlady soon, and going away to be married, and will leave your Nashik\r\nforgotten.\' Then she would grow thoughtful and say, \'I think I had\r\nbetter not marry if my Nashik cannot go with me, for I mean never to\r\nleave her.\' Yet, alas! She has left me now! Who was there in the world\r\nshe did not love? Yes, my dearest, it must never be POSSIBLE for you to\r\nforget your Mamma. She was not a being of earth--she was an angel from\r\nHeaven. When her soul has entered the heavenly kingdom she will continue\r\nto love you and to be proud of you even there."\r\n\r\n"But why do you say \'when her soul has entered the heavenly kingdom\'?" I\r\nasked. "I believe it is there now."\r\n\r\n"No, my dearest," replied Natalia as she lowered her voice and pressed\r\nherself yet closer to me, "her soul is still here," and she pointed\r\nupwards. She spoke in a whisper, but with such an intensity of\r\nconviction that I too involuntarily raised my eyes and looked at the\r\nceiling, as though expecting to see something there. "Before the souls\r\nof the just enter Paradise they have to undergo forty trials for forty\r\ndays, and during that time they hover around their earthly home." [A\r\nRussian popular legend.]\r\n\r\nShe went on speaking for some time in this strain--speaking with the\r\nsame simplicity and conviction as though she were relating common things\r\nwhich she herself had witnessed, and to doubt which could never enter\r\ninto any one\'s head. I listened almost breathlessly, and though I did\r\nnot understand all she said, I never for a moment doubted her word.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my darling, she is here now, and perhaps looking at us and\r\nlistening to what we are saying," concluded Natalia. Raising her head,\r\nshe remained silent for a while. At length she wiped away the tears\r\nwhich were streaming from her eyes, looked me straight in the face, and\r\nsaid in a voice trembling with emotion:\r\n\r\n"Ah, it is through many trials that God is leading me to Him. Why,\r\nindeed, am I still here? Whom have I to live for? Whom have I to love?"\r\n\r\n"Do you not love US, then?" I asked sadly, and half-choking with my\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Yes, God knows that I love you, my darling; but to love any one as I\r\nloved HER--that I cannot do."\r\n\r\nShe could say no more, but turned her head aside and wept bitterly. As\r\nfor me, I no longer thought of going to sleep, but sat silently with her\r\nand mingled my tears with hers.\r\n\r\nPresently Foka entered the room, but, on seeing our emotion and not\r\nwishing to disturb us, stopped short at the door.\r\n\r\n"Do you want anything, my good Foka?" asked Natalia as she wiped away\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n"If you please, half-a-pound of currants, four pounds of sugar, and\r\nthree pounds of rice for the kutia." [Cakes partaken of by the mourners\r\nat a Russian funeral.]\r\n\r\n"Yes, in one moment," said Natalia as she took a pinch of snuff and\r\nhastened to her drawers. All traces of the grief, aroused by our\r\nconversation disappeared on, the instant that she had duties to fulfil,\r\nfor she looked upon those duties as of paramount importance.\r\n\r\n"But why FOUR pounds?" she objected as she weighed the sugar on a\r\nsteelyard. "Three and a half would be sufficient," and she withdrew a\r\nfew lumps. "How is it, too, that, though I weighed out eight pounds of\r\nrice yesterday, more is wanted now? No offence to you, Foka, but I am\r\nnot going to waste rice like that. I suppose Vanka is glad that there\r\nis confusion in the house just now, for he thinks that nothing will be\r\nlooked after, but I am not going to have any careless extravagance with\r\nmy master\'s goods. Did one ever hear of such a thing? Eight pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I have nothing to do with it. He says it is all gone, that\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Hm, hm! Well, there it is. Let him take it."\r\n\r\nI was struck by the sudden transition from the touching sensibility\r\nwith which she had just been speaking to me to this petty reckoning and\r\ncaptiousness. Yet, thinking it over afterwards, I recognised that it was\r\nmerely because, in spite of what was lying on her heart, she retained\r\nthe habit of duty, and that it was the strength of that habit which\r\nenabled her to pursue her functions as of old. Her grief was too strong\r\nand too true to require any pretence of being unable to fulfil trivial\r\ntasks, nor would she have understood that any one could so pretend.\r\nVanity is a sentiment so entirely at variance with genuine grief, yet\r\na sentiment so inherent in human nature, that even the most poignant\r\nsorrow does not always drive it wholly forth. Vanity mingled with grief\r\nshows itself in a desire to be recognised as unhappy or resigned;\r\nand this ignoble desire--an aspiration which, for all that we may\r\nnot acknowledge it is rarely absent, even in cases of the utmost\r\naffliction--takes off greatly from the force, the dignity, and the\r\nsincerity of grief. Natalia Savishna had been so sorely smitten by her\r\nmisfortune that not a single wish of her own remained in her soul--she\r\nwent on living purely by habit.\r\n\r\nHaving handed over the provisions to Foka, and reminded him of the\r\nrefreshments which must be ready for the priests, she took up her\r\nknitting and seated herself by my side again. The conversation reverted\r\nto the old topic, and we once more mourned and shed tears together.\r\nThese talks with Natalia I repeated every day, for her quiet tears\r\nand words of devotion brought me relief and comfort. Soon, however, a\r\nparting came. Three days after the funeral we returned to Moscow, and I\r\nnever saw her again.\r\n\r\nGrandmamma received the sad tidings only on our return to her house, and\r\nher grief was extraordinary. At first we were not allowed to see her,\r\nsince for a whole week she was out of her mind, and the doctors were\r\nafraid for her life. Not only did she decline all medicine whatsoever,\r\nbut she refused to speak to anybody or to take nourishment, and never\r\nclosed her eyes in sleep. Sometimes, as she sat alone in the arm-chair in\r\nher room, she would begin laughing and crying at the same time, with a\r\nsort of tearless grief, or else relapse into convulsions, and scream out\r\ndreadful, incoherent words in a horrible voice. It was the first dire\r\nsorrow which she had known in her life, and it reduced her almost\r\nto distraction. She would begin accusing first one person, and then\r\nanother, of bringing this misfortune upon her, and rail at and blame\r\nthem with the most extraordinary virulence. Finally she would rise from\r\nher arm-chair, pace the room for a while, and end by falling senseless\r\nto the floor.\r\n\r\nOnce, when I went to her room, she appeared to be sitting quietly in her\r\nchair, yet with an air which struck me as curious. Though her eyes were\r\nwide open, their glance was vacant and meaningless, and she seemed to\r\ngaze in my direction without seeing me. Suddenly her lips parted slowly\r\nin a smile, and she said in a touchingly, tender voice: "Come here,\r\nthen, my dearest one; come here, my angel." Thinking that it was myself\r\nshe was addressing, I moved towards her, but it was not I whom she was\r\nbeholding at that moment. "Oh, my love," she went on, "if only you could\r\nknow how distracted I have been, and how delighted I am to see you once\r\nmore!" I understood then that she believed herself to be looking\r\nupon Mamma, and halted where I was. "They told me you were gone," she\r\nconcluded with a frown; "but what nonsense! As if you could die before\r\nME!" and she laughed a terrible, hysterical laugh.\r\n\r\nOnly those who can love strongly can experience an overwhelming grief.\r\nYet their very need of loving sometimes serves to throw off their grief\r\nfrom them and to save them. The moral nature of man is more tenacious of\r\nlife than the physical, and grief never kills.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Grandmamma\'s power of weeping came back to her, and she\r\nbegan to recover. Her first thought when her reason returned was for us\r\nchildren, and her love for us was greater than ever. We never left her\r\narm-chair, and she would talk of Mamma, and weep softly, and caress us.\r\n\r\nNobody who saw her grief could say that it was consciously exaggerated,\r\nfor its expression was too strong and touching; yet for some reason or\r\nanother my sympathy went out more to Natalia Savishna, and to this day\r\nI am convinced that nobody loved and regretted Mamma so purely and\r\nsincerely as did that simple-hearted, affectionate being.\r\n\r\nWith Mamma\'s death the happy time of my childhood came to an end, and\r\na new epoch--the epoch of my boyhood--began; but since my memories of\r\nNatalia Savishna (who exercised such a strong and beneficial influence\r\nupon the bent of my mind and the development of my sensibility) belong\r\nrather to the first period, I will add a few words about her and her\r\ndeath before closing this portion of my life.\r\n\r\nI heard later from people in the village that, after our return to\r\nMoscow, she found time hang very heavy on her hands. Although the\r\ndrawers and shelves were still under her charge, and she never ceased\r\nto arrange and rearrange them--to take things out and to dispose of them\r\nafresh--she sadly missed the din and bustle of the seignorial mansion to\r\nwhich she had been accustomed from her childhood up. Consequently\r\ngrief, the alteration in her mode of life, and her lack of activity soon\r\ncombined to develop in her a malady to which she had always been more or\r\nless subject.\r\n\r\nScarcely more than a year after Mamma\'s death dropsy showed itself, and\r\nshe took to her bed. I can imagine how sad it must have been for her\r\nto go on living--still more, to die--alone in that great empty house\r\nat Petrovskoe, with no relations or any one near her. Every one there\r\nesteemed and loved her, but she had formed no intimate friendships in\r\nthe place, and was rather proud of the fact. That was because, enjoying\r\nher master\'s confidence as she did, and having so much property\r\nunder her care, she considered that intimacies would lead to culpable\r\nindulgence and condescension. Consequently (and perhaps, also, because\r\nshe had nothing really in common with the other servants) she kept them\r\nall at a distance, and used to say that she "recognised neither kinsman\r\nnor godfather in the house, and would permit of no exceptions with\r\nregard to her master\'s property."\r\n\r\nInstead, she sought and found consolation in fervent prayers to God. Yet\r\nsometimes, in those moments of weakness to which all of us are\r\nsubject, and when man\'s best solace is the tears and compassion of his\r\nfellow-creatures, she would take her old dog Moska on to her bed, and\r\ntalk to it, and weep softly over it as it answered her caresses by\r\nlicking her hands, with its yellow eyes fixed upon her. When Moska\r\nbegan to whine she would say as she quieted it: "Enough, enough! I know\r\nwithout thy telling me that my time is near." A month before her death\r\nshe took out of her chest of drawers some fine white calico, white\r\ncambric, and pink ribbon, and, with the help of the maidservants,\r\nfashioned the garments in which she wished to be buried. Next she put\r\neverything on her shelves in order and handed the bailiff an inventory\r\nwhich she had made out with scrupulous accuracy. All that she kept\r\nback was a couple of silk gowns, an old shawl, and Grandpapa\'s military\r\nuniform--things which had been presented to her absolutely, and which,\r\nthanks to her care and orderliness, were in an excellent state of\r\npreservation--particularly the handsome gold embroidery on the uniform.\r\n\r\nJust before her death, again, she expressed a wish that one of the gowns\r\n(a pink one) should be made into a robe de chambre for Woloda; that the\r\nother one (a many-coloured gown) should be made into a similar garment\r\nfor myself; and that the shawl should go to Lubotshka. As for the\r\nuniform, it was to devolve either to Woloda or to myself, according as\r\nthe one or the other of us should first become an officer. All the rest\r\nof her property (save only forty roubles, which she set aside for her\r\ncommemorative rites and to defray the costs of her burial) was to pass\r\nto her brother, a person with whom, since he lived a dissipated life\r\nin a distant province, she had had no intercourse during her lifetime.\r\nWhen, eventually, he arrived to claim the inheritance, and found that\r\nits sum-total only amounted to twenty-five roubles in notes, he refused\r\nto believe it, and declared that it was impossible that his sister-a\r\nwoman who for sixty years had had sole charge in a wealthy house, as\r\nwell as all her life had been penurious and averse to giving away even\r\nthe smallest thing should have left no more: yet it was a fact.\r\n\r\nThough Natalia\'s last illness lasted for two months, she bore her\r\nsufferings with truly Christian fortitude. Never did she fret or\r\ncomplain, but, as usual, appealed continually to God. An hour before\r\nthe end came she made her final confession, received the Sacrament with\r\nquiet joy, and was accorded extreme unction. Then she begged forgiveness\r\nof every one in the house for any wrong she might have done them, and\r\nrequested the priest to send us word of the number of times she had\r\nblessed us for our love of her, as well as of how in her last moments\r\nshe had implored our forgiveness if, in her ignorance, she had ever at\r\nany time given us offence. "Yet a thief have I never been. Never have I\r\nused so much as a piece of thread that was not my own." Such was the one\r\nquality which she valued in herself.\r\n\r\nDressed in the cap and gown prepared so long beforehand, and with her\r\nhead resting, upon the cushion made for the purpose, she conversed with\r\nthe priest up to the very last moment, until, suddenly, recollecting\r\nthat she had left him nothing for the poor, she took out ten roubles,\r\nand asked him to distribute them in the parish. Lastly she made the sign\r\nof the cross, lay down, and expired--pronouncing with a smile of joy the\r\nname of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nShe quitted life without a pang, and, so far from fearing death,\r\nwelcomed it as a blessing. How often do we hear that said, and how\r\nseldom is it a reality! Natalia Savishna had no reason to fear death\r\nfor the simple reason that she died in a sure and certain faith and in\r\nstrict obedience to the commands of the Gospel. Her whole life had\r\nbeen one of pure, disinterested love, of utter self-negation. Had her\r\nconvictions been of a more enlightened order, her life directed to a\r\nhigher aim, would that pure soul have been the more worthy of love and\r\nreverence? She accomplished the highest and best achievement in this\r\nworld: she died without fear and without repining.\r\n\r\nThey buried her where she had wished to lie--near the little mausoleum\r\nwhich still covers Mamma\'s tomb. The little mound beneath which she\r\nsleeps is overgrown with nettles and burdock, and surrounded by a black\r\nrailing, but I never forget, when leaving the mausoleum, to approach\r\nthat railing, and to salute the plot of earth within by bowing\r\nreverently to the ground.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, I stand thoughtfully between the railing and the\r\nmausoleum, and sad memories pass through my mind. Once the idea came to\r\nme as I stood there: "Did Providence unite me to those two beings solely\r\nin order to make me regret them my life long?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Childhood, by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHILDHOOD ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2142.txt or 2142.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/2142/\r\n\r\nProduced by Martin Adamson and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
