They are newish, three-storied buildings of dingy grey brick\r\nwith slate roofs, and they are perfectly flat, without a bow-window or\r\neven a projecting cornice or window-sill to break the straightness of\r\nthe line from one end of the street to the other.\r\n\r\nThis Saturday afternoon the street was full of life; no traffic came\r\ndown Vere Street, and the cemented space between the pavements was\r\ngiven up to children. Several games of cricket were being played by\r\nwildly excited boys, using coats for wickets, an old tennis-ball or a\r\nbundle of rags tied together for a ball, and, generally, an old\r\nbroomstick for bat. The wicket was so large and the bat so small that\r\nthe man in was always getting bowled, when heated quarrels would\r\narise, the batter absolutely refusing to go out and the bowler\r\nabsolutely insisting on going in. The girls were more peaceable; they\r\nwere chiefly employed in skipping, and only abused one another mildly\r\nwhen the rope was not properly turned or the skipper did not jump\r\nsufficiently high. Worst off of all were the very young children, for\r\nthere had been no rain for weeks, and the street was as dry and clean\r\nas a covered court, and, in the lack of mud to wallow in, they sat\r\nabout the road, disconsolate as poets. The number of babies was\r\nprodigious; they sprawled about everywhere, on the pavement, round the\r\ndoors, and about their mothers\' skirts. The grown-ups were gathered\r\nround the open doors; there were usually two women squatting on the\r\ndoorstep, and two or three more seated on either side on chairs; they\r\nwere invariably nursing babies, and most of them showed clear signs\r\nthat the present object of the maternal care would be soon ousted by a\r\nnew arrival. Men were less numerous but such as there were leant\r\nagainst the walls, smoking, or sat on the sills of the ground-floor\r\nwindows. It was the dead season in Vere Street as much as in\r\nBelgravia, and really if it had not been for babies just come or just\r\nabout to come, and an opportune murder in a neighbouring doss-house,\r\nthere would have been nothing whatever to talk about. As it was, the\r\nlittle groups talked quietly, discussing the atrocity or the merits of\r\nthe local midwives, comparing the circumstances of their various\r\nconfinements.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll be \'avin\' your little trouble soon, eh, Polly?\' asked one good\r\nlady of another.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I reckon I\'ve got another two months ter go yet,\' answered Polly.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said a third. \'I wouldn\'t \'ave thought you\'d go so long by the\r\nlook of yer!\'\r\n\r\n\'I \'ope you\'ll have it easier this time, my dear,\' said a very stout\r\nold person, a woman of great importance.\r\n\r\n\'She said she wasn\'t goin\' to \'ave no more, when the last one come.\'\r\nThis remark came from Polly\'s husband.\r\n\r\n\'Ah,\' said the stout old lady, who was in the business, and boasted\r\nvast experience. \'That\'s wot they all says; but, Lor\' bless yer, they\r\ndon\'t mean it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ve got three, and I\'m not goin\' to \'ave no more bli\'me if I\r\nwill; \'tain\'t good enough--that\'s wot I says.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re abaht right there, ole gal,\' said Polly, \'My word, \'Arry, if\r\nyou \'ave any more I\'ll git a divorce, that I will.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment an organ-grinder turned the corner and came down the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\'Good biz; \'ere\'s an organ!\' cried half a dozen people at once.\r\n\r\nThe organ-man was an Italian, with a shock of black hair and a\r\nferocious moustache. Drawing his organ to a favourable spot, he\r\nstopped, released his shoulder from the leather straps by which he\r\ndragged it, and cocking his large soft hat on the side of his head,\r\nbegan turning the handle. It was a lively tune, and in less than no\r\ntime a little crowd had gathered round to listen, chiefly the young\r\nmen and the maidens, for the married ladies were never in a fit state\r\nto dance, and therefore disinclined to trouble themselves to stand\r\nround the organ. There was a moment\'s hesitation at opening the ball;\r\nthen one girl said to another:\r\n\r\n\'Come on, Florrie, you and me ain\'t shy; we\'ll begin, and bust it!\'\r\n\r\nThe two girls took hold of one another, one acting gentleman, the\r\nother lady; three or four more pairs of girls immediately joined them,\r\nand they began a waltz. They held themselves very upright; and with an\r\nair of grave dignity which was quite impressive, glided slowly about,\r\nmaking their steps with the utmost precision, bearing themselves with\r\nsufficient decorum for a court ball. After a while the men began to\r\nitch for a turn, and two of them, taking hold of one another in the\r\nmost approved fashion, waltzed round the circle with the gravity of\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a cry: \'There\'s Liza!\' And several members of\r\nthe group turned and called out: \'Oo, look at Liza!\'\r\n\r\nThe dancers stopped to see the sight, and the organ-grinder, having\r\ncome to the end of his tune, ceased turning the handle and looked to\r\nsee what was the excitement.\r\n\r\n\'Oo, Liza!\' they called out. \'Look at Liza; oo, I sy!\'\r\n\r\nIt was a young girl of about eighteen, with dark eyes, and an enormous\r\nfringe, puffed-out and curled and frizzed, covering her whole forehead\r\nfrom side to side, and coming down to meet her eyebrows. She was\r\ndressed in brilliant violet, with great lappets of velvet, and she had\r\non her head an enormous black hat covered with feathers.\r\n\r\n\'I sy, ain\'t she got up dossy?\' called out the groups at the doors, as\r\nshe passed.\r\n\r\n\'Dressed ter death, and kill the fashion; that\'s wot I calls it.\'\r\n\r\nLiza saw what a sensation she was creating; she arched her back and\r\nlifted her head, and walked down the street, swaying her body from\r\nside to side, and swaggering along as though the whole place belonged\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ave yer bought the street, Bill?\' shouted one youth; and then half a\r\ndozen burst forth at once, as if by inspiration:\r\n\r\n\'Knocked \'em in the Old Kent Road!\'\r\n\r\nIt was immediately taken up by a dozen more, and they all yelled it\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\'Knocked \'em in the Old Kent Road. Yah, ah, knocked \'em in the Old\r\nKent Road!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oo, Liza!\' they shouted; the whole street joined in, and they gave\r\nlong, shrill, ear-piercing shrieks and strange calls, that rung down\r\nthe street and echoed back again.\r\n\r\n\'Hextra special!\' called out a wag.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Liza! Oo! Ooo!\' yells and whistles, and then it thundered forth\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\'Knocked \'em in the Old Kent Road!\'\r\n\r\nLiza put on the air of a conquering hero, and sauntered on, enchanted\r\nat the uproar. She stuck out her elbows and jerked her head on one\r\nside, and said to herself as she passed through the bellowing crowd:\r\n\r\n\'This is jam!\'\r\n\r\n\'Knocked \'em in the Old Kent Road!\'\r\n\r\nWhen she came to the group round the barrel-organ, one of the girls\r\ncried out to her:\r\n\r\n\'Is that yer new dress, Liza?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it don\'t look like my old one, do it?\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Where did yer git it?\' asked another friend, rather enviously.\r\n\r\n\'Picked it up in the street, of course,\' scornfully answered Liza.\r\n\r\n\'I believe it\'s the same one as I saw in the pawnbroker\'s dahn the\r\nroad,\' said one of the men, to tease her.\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s it; but wot was you doin\' in there? Pledgin\' yer shirt, or was\r\nit yer trousers?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yah, I wouldn\'t git a second-\'and dress at a pawnbroker\'s!\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' said Liza indignantly. \'I\'ll swipe yer over the snitch if yer\r\ntalk ter me. I got the mayterials in the West Hend, didn\'t I? And I\r\n\'ad it mide up by my Court Dressmiker, so you jolly well dry up, old\r\njellybelly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' was the reply.\r\n\r\nLiza had been so intent on her new dress and the comment it was\r\nexciting that she had not noticed the organ.\r\n\r\n\'Oo, I say, let\'s \'ave some dancin\',\' she said as soon as she saw it.\r\n\'Come on, Sally,\' she added, to one of the girls, \'you an\' me\'ll dance\r\ntogither. Grind away, old cock!\'\r\n\r\nThe man turned on a new tune, and the organ began to play the\r\nIntermezzo from the \'Cavalleria\'; other couples quickly followed\r\nLiza\'s example, and they began to waltz round with the same solemnity\r\nas before; but Liza outdid them all; if the others were as stately as\r\nqueens, she was as stately as an empress; the gravity and dignity with\r\nwhich she waltzed were something appalling, you felt that the minuet\r\nwas a frolic in comparison; it would have been a fitting measure to\r\ntread round the grave of a _premi\xe8re danseuse_, or at the funeral of a\r\nprofessional humorist. And the graces she put on, the languor of the\r\neyes, the contemptuous curl of the lips, the exquisite turn of the\r\nhand, the dainty arching of the foot! You felt there could be no\r\nquestioning her right to the tyranny of Vere Street.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stopped short, and disengaged herself from her companion.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I sy,\' she said, \'this is too bloomin\' slow; it gives me the\r\nsick.\'\r\n\r\nThat is not precisely what she said, but it is impossible always to\r\ngive the exact unexpurgated words of Liza and the other personages of\r\nthe story, the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to\r\npiece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s too bloomin\' slow,\' she said again; \'it gives me the sick. Let\'s\r\n\'ave somethin\' a bit more lively than this \'ere waltz. You stand over\r\nthere, Sally, an\' we\'ll show \'em \'ow ter skirt dance.\'\r\n\r\nThey all stopped waltzing.\r\n\r\n\'Talk of the ballet at the Canterbury and South London. You just wite\r\ntill you see the ballet at Vere Street, Lambeth--we\'ll knock \'em!\'\r\n\r\nShe went up to the organ-grinder.\r\n\r\n\'Na then, Italiano,\' she said to him, \'you buck up; give us a tune\r\nthat\'s got some guts in it! See?\'\r\n\r\nShe caught hold of his big hat and squashed it down over his eyes. The\r\nman grinned from ear to ear, and, touching the little catch at the\r\nside, began to play a lively tune such as Liza had asked for.\r\n\r\nThe men had fallen out, but several girls had put themselves in\r\nposition, in couples, standing face to face; and immediately the music\r\nstruck up, they began. They held up their skirts on each side, so as\r\nto show their feet, and proceeded to go through the difficult steps\r\nand motions of the dance. Liza was right; they could not have done it\r\nbetter in a trained ballet. But the best dancer of them all was Liza;\r\nshe threw her whole soul into it; forgetting the stiff bearing which\r\nshe had thought proper to the waltz, and casting off its elaborate\r\ngraces, she gave herself up entirely to the present pleasure.\r\nGradually the other couples stood aside, so that Liza and Sally were\r\nleft alone. They paced it carefully, watching each other\'s steps, and\r\nas if by instinct performing corresponding movements, so as to make\r\nthe whole a thing of symmetry.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m abaht done,\' said Sally, blowing and puffing. \'I\'ve \'ad enough of\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go on, Liza!\' cried out a dozen voices when Sally stopped.\r\n\r\nShe gave no sign of having heard them other than calmly to continue\r\nher dance. She glided through the steps, and swayed about, and\r\nmanipulated her skirt, all with the most charming grace imaginable,\r\nthen, the music altering, she changed the style of her dancing, her\r\nfeet moved more quickly, and did not keep so strictly to the ground.\r\nShe was getting excited at the admiration of the onlookers, and her\r\ndance grew wilder and more daring. She lifted her skirts higher,\r\nbrought in new and more difficult movements into her improvisation,\r\nkicking up her legs she did the wonderful twist, backwards and\r\nforwards, of which the dancer is proud.\r\n\r\n\'Look at \'er legs!\' cried one of the men.\r\n\r\n\'Look at \'er stockin\'s!\' shouted another; and indeed they were\r\nremarkable, for Liza had chosen them of the same brilliant hue as her\r\ndress, and was herself most proud of the harmony.\r\n\r\nHer dance became gayer: her feet scarcely touched the ground, she\r\nwhirled round madly.\r\n\r\n\'Take care yer don\'t split!\' cried out one of the wags, at a very\r\naudacious kick.\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth when Liza, with a gigantic\r\neffort, raised her foot and kicked off his hat. The feat was greeted\r\nwith applause, and she went on, making turns and twists, flourishing\r\nher skirts, kicking higher and higher, and finally, among a volley of\r\nshouts, fell on her hands and turned head over heels in a magnificent\r\ncatharine-wheel; then scrambling to her feet again, she tumbled into\r\nthe arms of a young man standing in the front of the ring.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right, Liza,\' he said. \'Give us a kiss, now,\' and promptly\r\ntried to take one.\r\n\r\n\'Git aht!\' said Liza, pushing him away, not too gently.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, give us a kiss,\' cried another, running up to her.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll smack yer in the fice!\' said Liza, elegantly, as she dodged him.\r\n\r\n\'Ketch \'old on \'er, Bill,\' cried out a third, \'an\' we\'ll all kiss\r\nher.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, you won\'t!\' shrieked Liza, beginning to run.\r\n\r\n\'Come on,\' they cried, \'we\'ll ketch \'er.\'\r\n\r\nShe dodged in and out, between their legs, under their arms, and then,\r\ngetting clear of the little crowd, caught up her skirts so that they\r\nmight not hinder her, and took to her heels along the street. A score\r\nof men set in chase, whistling, shouting, yelling; the people at the\r\ndoors looked up to see the fun, and cried out to her as she dashed\r\npast; she ran like the wind. Suddenly a man from the side darted into\r\nthe middle of the road, stood straight in her way, and before she knew\r\nwhere she was, she had jumped shrieking into his arms, and he, lifting\r\nher up to him, had imprinted two sounding kisses on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you ----!\' she said. Her expression was quite unprintable; nor can\r\nit be euphemized.\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of laughter from the bystanders, and the young men\r\nin chase of her, and Liza, looking up, saw a big, bearded man whom she\r\nhad never seen before. She blushed to the very roots of her hair,\r\nquickly extricated herself from his arms, and, amid the jeers and\r\nlaughter of everyone, slid into the door of the nearest house and was\r\nlost to view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nLiza and her mother were having supper. Mrs. Kemp was an elderly woman,\r\nshort, and rather stout, with a red face, and grey hair brushed tight\r\nback over her forehead. She had been a widow for many years, and since\r\nher husband\'s death had lived with Liza in the ground-floor front room\r\nin which they were now sitting. Her husband had been a soldier, and\r\nfrom a grateful country she received a pension large enough to keep\r\nher from starvation, and by charring and doing such odd jobs as she\r\ncould get she earned a little extra to supply herself with liquor.\r\nLiza was able to make her own living by working at a factory.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp was rather sulky this evening.\r\n\r\n\'Wot was yer doin\' this afternoon, Liza?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'I was in the street.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re always in the street when I want yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know as \'ow yer wanted me, mother,\' answered Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Well, yer might \'ave come ter see! I might \'ave been dead, for all\r\nyou knew.\'\r\n\r\nLiza said nothing.\r\n\r\n\'My rheumatics was thet bad to-dy, thet I didn\'t know wot ter do with\r\nmyself. The doctor said I was to be rubbed with that stuff \'e give me,\r\nbut yer won\'t never do nothin\' for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, mother,\' said Liza, \'your rheumatics was all right yesterday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know wot you was doin\'; you was showin\' off thet new dress of\r\nyours. Pretty waste of money thet is, instead of givin\' it me ter sive\r\nup. An\' for the matter of thet, I wanted a new dress far worse than\r\nyou did. But, of course, I don\'t matter.\'\r\n\r\nLiza did not answer, and Mrs. Kemp, having nothing more to say,\r\ncontinued her supper in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was Liza who spoke next.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s some new people moved in the street. \'Ave you seen \'em?\' she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\'No, wot are they?\'\r\n\r\n\'I dunno; I\'ve seen a chap, a big chap with a beard. I think \'e lives\r\nup at the other end.\'\r\n\r\nShe felt herself blushing a little.\r\n\r\n\'No one any good you be sure,\' said Mrs. Kemp. \'I can\'t swaller these\r\nnew people as are comin\' in; the street ain\'t wot it was when I fust\r\ncome.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they had done, Mrs. Kemp got up, and having finished her half-pint\r\nof beer, said to her daughter:\r\n\r\n\'Put the things awy, Liza. I\'m just goin\' round to see Mrs. Clayton;\r\nshe\'s just \'ad twins, and she \'ad nine before these come. It\'s a pity\r\nthe Lord don\'t see fit ter tike some on \'em--thet\'s wot I say.\'\r\n\r\nAfter which pious remark Mrs. Kemp went out of the house and turned\r\ninto another a few doors up.\r\n\r\nLiza did not clear the supper things away as she was told, but opened\r\nthe window and drew her chair to it. She leant on the sill, looking\r\nout into the street. The sun had set, and it was twilight, the sky was\r\ngrowing dark, bringing to view the twinkling stars; there was no\r\nbreeze, but it was pleasantly and restfully cool. The good folk still\r\nsat at their doorsteps, talking as before on the same inexhaustible\r\nsubjects, but a little subdued with the approach of night. The boys\r\nwere still playing cricket, but they were mostly at the other end of\r\nthe street, and their shouts were muffled before they reached Liza\'s\r\nears.\r\n\r\nShe sat, leaning her head on her hands, breathing in the fresh air and\r\nfeeling a certain exquisite sense of peacefulness which she was not\r\nused to. It was Saturday evening, and she thankfully remembered that\r\nthere would be no factory on the morrow; she was glad to rest.\r\nSomehow she felt a little tired, perhaps it was through the excitement\r\nof the afternoon, and she enjoyed the quietness of the evening. It\r\nseemed so tranquil and still; the silence filled her with a strange\r\ndelight, she felt as if she could sit there all through the night\r\nlooking out into the cool, dark street, and up heavenwards at the\r\nstars. She was very happy, but yet at the same time experienced a\r\nstrange new sensation of melancholy, and she almost wished to cry.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dark form stepped in front of the open window. She gave a\r\nlittle shriek.\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo\'s thet?\' she asked, for it was quite dark, and she did not\r\nrecognize the man standing in front of her.\r\n\r\n\'Me, Liza,\' was the answer.\r\n\r\n\'Tom?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\'\r\n\r\nIt was a young man with light yellow hair and a little fair moustache,\r\nwhich made him appear almost boyish; he was light-complexioned and\r\nblue-eyed, and had a frank and pleasant look mingled with a curious\r\nbashfulness that made him blush when people spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s up?\' asked Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Come aht for a walk, Liza, will yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'No!\' she answered decisively.\r\n\r\n\'You promised ter yesterday, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yesterday an\' ter-day\'s two different things,\' was her wise reply.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, come on, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I tell yer, I won\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want ter talk ter yer, Liza.\' Her hand was resting on the\r\nwindow-sill, and he put his upon it. She quickly drew it back.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t want yer ter talk ter me.\'\r\n\r\nBut she did, for it was she who broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\'Say, Tom, \'oo are them new folk as \'as come into the street? It\'s a\r\nbig chap with a brown beard.\'\r\n\r\n\'D\'you mean the bloke as kissed yer this afternoon?\'\r\n\r\nLiza blushed again.\r\n\r\n\'Well, why shouldn\'t \'e kiss me?\' she said, with some inconsequence.\r\n\r\n\'I never said as \'ow \'e shouldn\'t; I only arst yer if it was the\r\nsime.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yea, thet\'s \'oo I mean.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Is nime is Blakeston--Jim Blakeston. I\'ve only spoke to \'im once;\r\nhe\'s took the two top rooms at No. 19 \'ouse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s \'e want two top rooms for?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Im? Oh, \'e\'s got a big family--five kids. Ain\'t yer seen \'is wife\r\nabaht the street? She\'s a big, fat woman, as does \'er \'air funny.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know \'e \'ad a wife.\'\r\n\r\nThere was another silence; Liza sat thinking, and Tom stood at the\r\nwindow, looking at her.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t yer come aht with me, Liza?\' he asked, at last.\r\n\r\n\'Na, Tom,\' she said, a little more gently, \'it\'s too lite.\'\r\n\r\n\'Liza,\' he said, blushing to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n\'Well?\'\r\n\r\n\'Liza\'--he couldn\'t go on, and stuttered in his shyness--\'Liza,\r\nI--I--I loves yer, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn awy!\'\r\n\r\nHe was quite brave now, and took hold of her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Liza, I\'m earnin\' twenty-three shillin\'s at the works now,\r\nan\' I\'ve got some furniture as mother left me when she was took.\'\r\n\r\nThe girl said nothing.\r\n\r\n\'Liza, will you \'ave me? I\'ll make yer a good \'usband, Liza, swop me\r\nbob, I will; an\' yer know I\'m not a drinkin\' sort. Liza, will yer\r\nmarry me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Tom,\' she answered quietly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Liza, won\'t you \'ave me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Tom, I can\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not? You\'ve come aht walkin\' with me ever since Whitsun.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, things is different now.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re not walkin\' aht with anybody else, are you, Liza?\' he asked\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\'Na, not that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, why won\'t yer, Liza? Oh Liza, I do love yer, I\'ve never loved\r\nanybody as I love you!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I can\'t, Tom!\'\r\n\r\n\'There ain\'t no one else?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very sorry, Tom, but I don\'t love yer so as ter marry yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Liza!\'\r\n\r\nShe could not see the look upon his face, but she heard the agony in\r\nhis voice; and, moved with sudden pity, she bent out, threw her arms\r\nround his neck, and kissed him on both cheeks.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind old chap!\' she said. \'I\'m not worth troublin\' abaht.\'\r\n\r\nAnd quickly drawing back, she slammed the window to, and moved into\r\nthe further part of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day was Sunday. Liza when she was dressing herself in\r\nthe morning, felt the hardness of fate in the impossibility of eating\r\none\'s cake and having it; she wished she had reserved her new dress,\r\nand had still before her the sensation of a first appearance in it.\r\nWith a sigh she put on her ordinary everyday working dress, and\r\nproceeded to get the breakfast ready, for her mother had been out late\r\nthe previous night, celebrating the new arrivals in the street, and\r\nhad the \'rheumatics\' this morning.\r\n\r\n\'Oo, my \'ead!\' she was saying, as she pressed her hands on each side\r\nof her forehead. \'I\'ve got the neuralgy again, wot shall I do? I dunno\r\n\'ow it is, but it always comes on Sunday mornings. Oo, an\' my\r\nrheumatics, they give me sich a doin\' in the night!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better go to the \'orspital mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not I!\' answered the worthy lady, with great decision. \'You \'as a\r\ndozen young chaps messin\' you abaht, and lookin\' at yer, and then they\r\ntells yer ter leave off beer and spirrits. Well, wot I says, I says I\r\ncan\'t do withaht my glass of beer.\' She thumped her pillow to\r\nemphasize the statement.\r\n\r\n\'Wot with the work I \'ave ter do, lookin\' after you and the cookin\'\r\nand gettin\' everythin\' ready and doin\' all the \'ouse-work, and goin\'\r\naht charring besides--well, I says, if I don\'t \'ave a drop of beer, I\r\nsays, ter pull me together, I should be under the turf in no time.\'\r\n\r\nShe munched her bread-and-butter and drank her tea.\r\n\r\n\'When you\'ve done breakfast, Liza,\' she said, \'you can give the grate\r\na cleanin\', an\' my boots\'d do with a bit of polishin\'. Mrs. Tike, in\r\nthe next \'ouse, \'ll give yer some blackin\'.\'\r\n\r\nShe remained silent for a bit, then said:\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think I shall get up ter-day. Liza. My rheumatics is bad. You\r\ncan put the room straight and cook the dinner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, mother, you stay where you are, an\' I\'ll do everythin\' for\r\nyer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s only wot yer ought to do, considerin\' all the trouble\r\nyou\'ve been ter me when you was young, and considerin\' thet when you\r\nwas born the doctor thought I never should get through it. Wot \'ave\r\nyou done with your week\'s money, Liza?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'ve put it awy,\' answered Liza quietly.\r\n\r\n\'Where?\' asked her mother.\r\n\r\n\'Where it\'ll be safe.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s that?\'\r\n\r\nLiza was driven into a corner.\r\n\r\n\'Why d\'you want ter know?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Why shouldn\'t I know; d\'you think I want ter steal it from yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, not thet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, why won\'t you tell me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, a thing\'s sifer when only one person knows where it is.\'\r\n\r\nThis was a very discreet remark, but it set Mrs. Kemp in a whirlwind of\r\npassion. She raised herself and sat up in the bed, flourishing her\r\nclenched fist at her daughter.\r\n\r\n\'I know wot yer mean, you ---- you!\' Her language was emphatic, her\r\nepithets picturesque, but too forcible for reproduction. \'You think\r\nI\'d steal it,\' she went on. \'I know yer! D\'yer think I\'d go an\' tike\r\nyer dirty money?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, mother,\' said Liza, \'when I\'ve told yer before, the money\'s\r\nperspired like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot d\'yer mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'It got less.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I can\'t \'elp thet, can I? Anyone can come in \'ere and tike the\r\nmoney.\'\r\n\r\n\'If it\'s \'idden awy, they can\'t, can they, mother?\' said Liza.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp shook her fist.\r\n\r\n\'You dirty slut, you,\' she said, \'yer think I tike yer money! Why, you\r\nought ter give it me every week instead of savin\' it up and spendin\'\r\nit on all sorts of muck, while I \'ave ter grind my very bones down to\r\nkeep yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, mother, if I didn\'t \'ave a little bit saved up, we should\r\nbe rather short when you\'re dahn in yer luck.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp\'s money always ran out on Tuesday, and Liza had to keep\r\nthings going till the following Saturday.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t talk ter me!\' proceeded Mrs. Kemp. \'When I was a girl I give\r\nall my money ter my mother. She never \'ad ter ask me for nothin\'. On\r\nSaturday when I come \'ome with my wiges, I give it \'er every farthin\'.\r\nThat\'s wot a daughter ought ter do. I can say this for myself, I\r\nbe\'aved by my mother like a gal should. None of your prodigal sons for\r\nme! She didn\'t \'ave ter ask me for three \'apence ter get a drop of\r\nbeer.\'\r\n\r\nLiza was wise in her generation; she held her tongue, and put on her\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\'Now, you\'re goin\' aht, and leavin\' me; I dunno wot you get up to in\r\nthe street with all those men. No good, I\'ll be bound. An\' \'ere am I\r\nleft alone, an\' I might die for all you care.\'\r\n\r\nIn her sorrow at herself the old lady began to cry, and Liza slipped\r\nout of the room and into the street.\r\n\r\nLeaning against the wall of the opposite house was Tom; he came\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa!\' she said, as she saw him. \'Wot are you doin\' \'ere?\'\r\n\r\n\'I was waitin\' for you ter come aht, Liza,\' he answered.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly.\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t comin\' aht with yer ter-day, if thet\'s wot yer mean,\' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\'I never thought of arskin\' yer, Liza--after wot you said ter me last\r\nnight.\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was a little sad, and she felt so sorry for him.\r\n\r\n\'But yer did want ter speak ter me, didn\'t yer, Tom?\' she said, more\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve got a day off ter-morrow, ain\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Bank \'Oliday. Yus! Why?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, \'cause they\'ve got a drag startin\' from the "Red Lion" that\'s\r\ngoin\' down ter Chingford for the day--an\' I\'m goin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\' she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\'Will yer come too, Liza? It\'ll be a regular beeno; there\'s only goin\'\r\nter be people in the street. Eh, Liza?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I can\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t got--I ain\'t got the ooftish.\'\r\n\r\n\'I mean, won\'t yer come with me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Tom, thank yer; I can\'t do thet neither.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer might as well, Liza; it wouldn\'t \'urt yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, it wouldn\'t be right like; I can\'t come aht with yer, and then\r\nmean nothin\'! It would be doin\' yer aht of an outing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see why,\' he said, very crestfallen.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t go on keepin\' company with you--after what I said last night.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t enjoy it a bit without you, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'You git somebody else, Tom. You\'ll do withaht me all right.\'\r\n\r\nShe nodded to him, and walked up the street to the house of her friend\r\nSally. Having arrived in front of it, she put her hands to her mouth\r\nin trumpet form, and shouted:\r\n\r\n\'\'I! \'I! \'I! Sally!\'\r\n\r\nA couple of fellows standing by copied her.\r\n\r\n\'\'I! \'I! \'I! Sally!\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' said Liza, looking round at them.\r\n\r\nSally did not appear and she repeated her call. The men imitated her,\r\nand half a dozen took it up, so that there was enough noise to wake\r\nthe seven sleepers.\r\n\r\n\'\'I! \'I! \'I! Sally!\'\r\n\r\nA head was put out of a top window, and Liza, taking off her hat,\r\nwaved it, crying:\r\n\r\n\'Come on dahn, Sally!\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, old gal!\' shouted the other. \'I\'m comin\'!\'\r\n\r\n\'So\'s Christmas!\' was Liza\'s repartee.\r\n\r\nThere was a clatter down the stairs, and Sally, rushing through the\r\npassage, threw herself on to her friend. They began fooling, in\r\nreminiscence of a melodrama they had lately seen together.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, my darlin\' duck!\' said Liza, kissing her and pressing her, with\r\naffected rapture, to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\'My sweetest sweet!\' replied Sally, copying her.\r\n\r\n\'An\' \'ow does your lidyship ter-day?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\'--with immense languor--\'fust class; and is your royal \'ighness\r\nquite well?\'\r\n\r\n\'I deeply regret,\' answered Liza, \'but my royal \'ighness \'as got the\r\ncollywobbles.\'\r\n\r\nSally was a small, thin girl, with sandy hair and blue eyes, and a\r\nvery freckled complexion. She had an enormous mouth, with terrible,\r\nsquare teeth set wide apart, which looked as if they could masticate\r\nan iron bar. She was dressed like Liza, in a shortish black skirt and\r\nan old-fashioned bodice, green and grey and yellow with age; her\r\nsleeves were tucked up to the elbow, and she wore a singularly dirty\r\napron, that had once been white.\r\n\r\n\'Wot \'ave you got yer \'air in them things for?\' asked Liza, pointing\r\nto the curl-papers. \'Goin\' aht with yer young man ter-day?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'m going ter stay \'ere all day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot for, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, \'Arry\'s going ter tike me ter Chingford ter-morrer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh? In the "Red Lion" brake?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus. Are you goin\'?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not! Well, why don\'t you get round Tom? \'E\'ll tike yer, and jolly\r\nglad \'e\'ll be, too.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E arst me ter go with \'im, but I wouldn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Swop me bob--why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t keeping company with \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer might \'ave gone with \'im all the sime.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na. You\'re goin\' with \'Arry, ain\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' you\'re goin\' to \'ave \'im?\'\r\n\r\n\'Right again!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I couldn\'t go with Tom, and then throw him over.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you are a mug!\'\r\n\r\nThe two girls had strolled down towards the Westminster Bridge Road,\r\nand Sally, meeting her young man, had gone to him. Liza walked back,\r\nwishing to get home in time to cook the dinner. But she went slowly,\r\nfor she knew every dweller in the street, and as she passed the groups\r\nsitting at their doors, as on the previous evening, but this time\r\nmostly engaged in peeling potatoes or shelling peas, she stopped and\r\nhad a little chat. Everyone liked her, and was glad to have her\r\ncompany. \'Good old Liza,\' they would say, as she left them, \'she\'s a\r\nrare good sort, ain\'t she?\'\r\n\r\nShe asked after the aches and pains of all the old people, and\r\ndelicately inquired after the babies, past and future; the children\r\nhung on to her skirts and asked her to play with them, and she would\r\nhold one end of the rope while tiny little ragged girls skipped,\r\ninvariably entangling themselves after two jumps.\r\n\r\nShe had nearly reached home, when she heard a voice cry:\r\n\r\n\'Mornin\'!\'\r\n\r\nShe looked round and recognized the man whom Tom had told her was\r\ncalled Jim Blakeston. He was sitting on a stool at the door of one of\r\nthe houses, playing with two young children, to whom he was giving\r\nrides on his knee. She remembered his heavy brown beard from the day\r\nbefore, and she had also an impression of great size; she noticed this\r\nmorning that he was, in fact, a big man, tall and broad, and she saw\r\nbesides that he had large, masculine features and pleasant brown eyes.\r\nShe supposed him to be about forty.\r\n\r\n\'Mornin\'!\' he said again, as she stopped and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\'Well, yer needn\'t look as if I was goin\' ter eat yer up, \'cause I\r\nain\'t,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo are you? I\'m not afeard of yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot are yer so bloomin\' red abaht?\' he asked pointedly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m \'ot.\'\r\n\r\n\'You ain\'t shirty \'cause I kissed yer last night?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not shirty; but it was pretty cool, considerin\' like as I didn\'t\r\nknow yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you run into my arms.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet I didn\'t; you run aht and caught me.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' kissed yer before you could say "Jack Robinson".\' He laughed at\r\nthe thought. \'Well, Liza,\' he went on, \'seein\' as \'ow I kissed yer\r\nagainst yer will, the best thing you can do ter make it up is to kiss\r\nme not against yer will.\'\r\n\r\n\'Me?\' said Liza, looking at him, open-mouthed. \'Well you are a pill!\'\r\n\r\nThe children began to clamour for the riding, which had been\r\ndiscontinued on Liza\'s approach.\r\n\r\n\'Are them your kids?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Yus; them\'s two on \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow many \'ave yer got?\'\r\n\r\n\'Five; the eldest gal\'s fifteen, and the next one \'oo\'s a boy\'s\r\ntwelve, and then there are these two and baby.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you\'ve got enough for your money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Too many for me--and more comin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah well,\' said Liza, laughing, \'thet\'s your fault, ain\'t it?\'\r\n\r\nThen she bade him good morning, and strolled off.\r\n\r\nHe watched her as she went, and saw half a dozen little boys surround\r\nher and beg her to join them in their game of cricket. They caught\r\nhold of her arms and skirts, and pulled her to their pitch.\r\n\r\n\'No, I can\'t,\' she said trying to disengage herself. \'I\'ve got the\r\ndinner ter cook.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dinner ter cook?\' shouted one small boy. \'Why, they always cooks the\r\ncats\' meat at the shop.\'\r\n\r\n\'You little so-and-so!\' said Liza, somewhat inelegantly, making a dash\r\nat him.\r\n\r\nHe dodged her and gave a whoop; then turning he caught her round the\r\nlegs, and another boy catching hold of her round the neck they dragged\r\nher down, and all three struggled on the ground, rolling over and\r\nover; the other boys threw themselves on the top, so that there was a\r\ngreat heap of legs and arms and heads waving and bobbing up and down.\r\n\r\nLiza extricated herself with some difficulty, and taking off her hat\r\nshe began cuffing the boys with it, using all the time the most lively\r\nexpressions. Then, having cleared the field, she retired victorious\r\ninto her own house and began cooking the dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nBank Holiday was a beautiful day: the cloudless sky threatened a\r\nstifling heat for noontide, but early in the morning, when Liza got\r\nout of bed and threw open the window, it was fresh and cool. She\r\ndressed herself, wondering how she should spend her day; she thought\r\nof Sally going off to Chingford with her lover, and of herself\r\nremaining alone in the dull street with half the people away. She\r\nalmost wished it were an ordinary work-day, and that there were no\r\nsuch things as bank holidays. And it seemed to be a little like two\r\nSundays running, but with the second rather worse than the first. Her\r\nmother was still sleeping, and she was in no great hurry about getting\r\nthe breakfast, but stood quietly looking out of the window at the\r\nhouse opposite.\r\n\r\nIn a little while she saw Sally coming along. She was arrayed in\r\npurple and fine linen--a very smart red dress, trimmed with velveteen,\r\nand a tremendous hat covered with feathers. She had reaped the benefit\r\nof keeping her hair in curl-papers since Saturday, and her sandy\r\nfringe stretched from ear to ear. She was in enormous spirits.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa, Liza!\' she called as soon as she saw her at the window.\r\n\r\nLiza looked at her a little enviously.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa!\' she answered quietly.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m just goin\' to the "Red Lion" to meet \'Arry.\'\r\n\r\n\'At what time d\'yer start?\'\r\n\r\n\'The brake leaves at \'alf-past eight sharp.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, it\'s only eight; it\'s only just struck at the church. \'Arry\r\nwon\'t be there yet, will he?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, \'e\'s sure ter be early. I couldn\'t wite. I\'ve been witin\' abaht\r\nsince \'alf-past six. I\'ve been up since five this morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Since five! What \'ave you been doin\'?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dressin\' myself and doin\' my \'air. I woke up so early. I\'ve been\r\ndreamin\' all the night abaht it. I simply couldn\'t sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you are a caution!\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Bust it, I don\'t go on the spree every day! Oh, I do \'ope I shall\r\nenjoy myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, you simply dunno where you are!\' said Liza, a little crossly.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you wish you was comin\', Liza?\' asked Sally.\r\n\r\n\'Na! I could if I liked, but I don\'t want ter.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are a coughdrop--thet\'s all I can say. Ketch me refusin\' when I\r\n\'ave the chanst.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s done now. I ain\'t got the chanst any more.\' Liza said this\r\nwith just a little regret in her voice.\r\n\r\n\'Come on dahn to the "Red Lion", Liza, and see us off,\' said Sally.\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'m damned if I do!\' answered Liza, with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\'You might as well. P\'raps \'Arry won\'t be there, an\' you can keep me\r\ncompany till \'e comes. An\' you can see the \'orses.\'\r\n\r\nLiza was really very anxious to see the brake and the horses and the\r\npeople going; but she hesitated a little longer. Sally asked her once\r\nagain. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\'Arright; I\'ll come with yer, and wite till the bloomin\' old thing\r\nstarts.\'\r\n\r\nShe did not trouble to put on a hat, but just walked out as she was,\r\nand accompanied Sally to the public-house which was getting up the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was still nearly half an hour to wait, the brake was\r\ndrawn up before the main entrance; it was large and long, with seats\r\narranged crosswise, so that four people could sit on each; and it was\r\ndrawn by two powerful horses, whose harness the coachman was now\r\nexamining. Sally was not the first on the scene, for already half a\r\ndozen people had taken their places, but Harry had not yet arrived.\r\nThe two girls stood by the public-door, looking at the preparations.\r\nHuge baskets full of food were brought out and stowed away; cases of\r\nbeer were hoisted up and put in every possible place--under the seats,\r\nunder the driver\'s legs, and even beneath the brake. As more people\r\ncame up, Sally began to get excited about Harry\'s non-appearance.\r\n\r\n\'I say, I wish \'e\'d come!\' she said. \'\'E is lite.\'\r\n\r\nThen she looked up and down the Westminster Bridge Road to see if he\r\nwas in view.\r\n\r\n\'Suppose \'e don\'t turn up! I will give it \'im when \'e comes for\r\nkeepin\' me witin\' like this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, there\'s a quarter of an hour yet,\' said Liza, who saw nothing at\r\nall to get excited about.\r\n\r\nAt last Sally saw her lover, and rushed off to meet him. Liza was left\r\nalone, rather disconsolate at all this bustle and preparation. She was\r\nnot sorry that she had refused Tom\'s invitation, but she did wish that\r\nshe had conscientiously been able to accept it. Sally and her friend\r\ncame up; attired in his Sunday best, he was a fit match for his\r\nlady-love--he wore a shirt and collar, unusual luxuries--and be\r\ncarried under his arm a concertina to make things merry on the way.\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t you goin\', Liza?\' he asked in surprise at seeing her without a\r\nhat and with her apron on.\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' said Sally, \'ain\'t she a soft? Tom said \'e\'d tike \'er, an\' she\r\nwouldn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m dashed!\'\r\n\r\nThen they climbed the ladder and took their seats, so that Liza was\r\nleft alone again. More people had come along, and the brake was nearly\r\nfull. Liza knew them all, but they were too busy taking their places\r\nto talk to her. At last Tom came. He saw her standing there and went\r\nup to her.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t yer change yer mind, Liza, an\' come along with us?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Tom, I told yer I wouldn\'t--it\'s not right like.\' She felt she\r\nmust repeat that to herself often.\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t enjoy it a bit without you,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I can\'t \'elp it!\' she answered, somewhat sullenly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a man came out of the public-house with a horn in his\r\nhand; her heart gave a great jump, for if there was anything she\r\nadored it was to drive along to the tootling of a horn. She really\r\nfelt it was very hard lines that she must stay at home when all these\r\npeople were going to have such a fine time; and they were all so\r\nmerry, and she could picture to herself so well the delights of the\r\ndrive and the picnic. She felt very much inclined to cry. But she\r\nmustn\'t go, and she wouldn\'t go: she repeated that to herself twice as\r\nthe trumpeter gave a preliminary tootle.\r\n\r\nTwo more people hurried along, and when they came near Liza saw that\r\nthey were Jim Blakeston and a woman whom she supposed to be his wife.\r\n\r\n\'Are you comin\', Liza?\' Jim said to her.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' she answered. \'I didn\'t know you was goin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you was comin\',\' he replied, \'we shall \'ave a game.\'\r\n\r\nShe could only just keep back the sobs; she so wished she were going.\r\nIt did seem hard that she must remain behind; and all because she\r\nwasn\'t going to marry Tom. After all, she didn\'t see why that should\r\nprevent her; there really was no need to refuse for that. She began to\r\nthink she had acted foolishly: it didn\'t do anyone any good that she\r\nrefused to go out with Tom, and no one thought it anything specially\r\nfine that she should renounce her pleasure. Sally merely thought her a\r\nfool.\r\n\r\nTom was standing by her side, silent, and looking disappointed and\r\nrather unhappy. Jim said to her, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry you\'re not comin\'!\'\r\n\r\nIt was too much. She did want to go so badly, and she really couldn\'t\r\nresist any longer. If Tom would only ask her once more, and if she\r\ncould only change her mind reasonably and decently, she would accept;\r\nbut he stood silent, and she had to speak herself. It was very\r\nundignified.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Tom.\' she said, \'I don\'t want ter spoil your day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t think I shall go alone; it \'ud be so precious slow.\'\r\n\r\nSupposing he didn\'t ask her again! What should she do? She looked up\r\nat the clock on the front of the pub, and noticed that it only wanted\r\nfive minutes to the half-hour. How terrible it would be if the brake\r\nstarted and he didn\'t ask her! Her heart beat violently against her\r\nchest, and in her agitation she fumbled with the corner of her apron.\r\n\r\n\'Well, what can I do, Tom dear?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, come with me, of course. Oh. Liza, do say yes.\'\r\n\r\nShe had got the offer again, and it only wanted a little seemly\r\nhesitation, and the thing was done.\r\n\r\n\'I should like ter, Tom,\' she said. \'But d\'you think it \'ud be\r\narright?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, of course it would. Come on, Liza!\' In his eagerness he clasped\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' she remarked, looking down, \'if it\'d spoil your \'oliday--.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t go if you don\'t--swop me bob, I won\'t!\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'Well, if I come, it won\'t mean that I\'m keepin\' company with you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, it won\'t mean anythin\' you don\'t like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright!\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll come?\' he could hardly believe her.\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\' she answered, smiling all over her face.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a good sort, Liza! I say, \'Arry, Liza\'s comin\'!\' he shouted.\r\n\r\n\'Liza? \'Oorray!\' shouted Harry.\r\n\r\n\'\'S\'at right, Liza?\' called Sally.\r\n\r\nAnd Liza feeling quite joyful and light of heart called back:\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Oorray!\' shouted Sally in answer.\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s right, Liza,\' called Jim; and he smiled pleasantly as she\r\nlooked at him.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s just room for you two \'ere,\' said Harry, pointing to the\r\nvacant places by his side.\r\n\r\n\'Arright!\' said Tom.\r\n\r\n\'I must jest go an\' get a \'at an\' tell mother,\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s just three minutes. Be quick!\' answered Tom, and as she\r\nscampered off as hard as she could go, he shouted to the coachman:\r\n\'\'Old \'ard; there\' another passenger comin\' in a minute.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, old cock,\' answered the coachman: \'no \'urry!\'\r\n\r\nLiza rushed into the room, and called to her mother, who was still\r\nasleep:\r\n\r\n\'Mother! mother! I\'m going to Chingford!\'\r\n\r\nThen tearing off her old dress she slipped into her gorgeous violet\r\none; she kicked off her old ragged shoes and put on her new boots. She\r\nbrushed her hair down and rapidly gave her fringe a twirl and a\r\ntwist--it was luckily still moderately in curl from the previous\r\nSaturday--and putting on her black hat with all the feathers, she\r\nrushed along the street, and scrambling up the brake steps fell\r\npanting on Tom\'s lap.\r\n\r\nThe coachman cracked his whip, the trumpeter tootled his horn, and\r\nwith a cry and a cheer from the occupants, the brake clattered down\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Liza had recovered herself she started examining the people\r\non the brake; and first of all she took stock of the woman whom Jim\r\nBlakeston had with him.\r\n\r\n\'This is my missus!\' said Jim, pointing to her with his thumb.\r\n\r\n\'You ain\'t been dahn in the street much, \'ave yer?\' said Liza, by way\r\nof making the acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' answered Mrs. Blakeston, \'my youngster\'s been dahn with the\r\nmeasles, an\' I\'ve \'ad my work cut out lookin\' after \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, an\' is \'e all right now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, \'e\'s gettin\' on fine, an\' Jim wanted ter go ter Chingford\r\nter-day, an\' \'e says ter me, well, \'e says, "You come along ter\r\nChingford, too; it\'ll do you good." An\' \'e says, "You can leave\r\nPolly"--she\'s my eldest, yer know--"you can leave Polly," says \'e,\r\n"ter look after the kids." So I says, "Well, I don\'t mind if I do,"\r\nsays I.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Liza was looking at her. First she noticed her dress: she\r\nwore a black cloak and a funny, old-fashioned black bonnet; then\r\nexamining the woman herself, she saw a middle-sized, stout person\r\nanywhere between thirty and forty years old. She had a large, fat face\r\nwith a big mouth, and her hair was curiously done, parted in the\r\nmiddle and plastered down on each side of the head in little plaits.\r\nOne could see that she was a woman of great strength, notwithstanding\r\nevident traces of hard work and much child-bearing.\r\n\r\nLiza knew all the other passengers, and now that everyone was settled\r\ndown and had got over the excitement of departure, they had time to\r\ngreet one another. They were delighted to have Liza among them, for\r\nwhere she was there was no dullness. Her attention was first of all\r\ntaken up by a young coster who had arrayed himself in the traditional\r\ncostume--grey suit, tight trousers, and shiny buttons in profusion.\r\n\r\n\'Wot cheer, Bill!\' she cried to him.\r\n\r\n\'Wot cheer, Liza!\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'You are got up dossy, you\'ll knock \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na then, Liza Kemp,\' said his companion, turning round with mock\r\nindignation, \'you let my Johnny alone. If you come gettin\' round \'im\r\nI\'ll give you wot for.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, Clary Sharp, I don\'t want \'im,\' answered Liza. \'I\'ve got one\r\nof my own, an\' thet\'s a good \'andful--ain\'t it, Tom?\'\r\n\r\nTom was delighted, and, unable to find a repartee, in his pleasure\r\ngave Liza a great nudge with his elbow.\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo, I say,\' said Liza, putting her hand to her side. \'Tike care of\r\nmy ribs; you\'ll brike \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Them\'s not yer ribs,\' shouted a candid friend--\'them\'s yer\r\nwhale-bones yer afraid of breakin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ave yer got whale-bones?\' said Tom, with affected simplicity,\r\nputting his arm round her waist to feel.\r\n\r\n\'Na, then,\' she said, \'keep off the grass!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I only wanted ter know if you\'d got any.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn; yer don\'t git round me like thet.\'\r\n\r\nHe still kept as he was.\r\n\r\n\'Na then,\' she repeated, \'tike yer \'and away. If yer touch me there\r\nyou\'ll \'ave ter marry me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s just wot I wants ter do, Liza!\'\r\n\r\n\'Shut it!\' she answered cruelly, and drew his arm away from her waist.\r\n\r\nThe horses scampered on, and the man behind blew his horn with vigour.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t bust yerself, guv\'nor!\' said one of the passengers to him when\r\nhe made a particularly discordant sound. They drove along eastwards,\r\nand as the hour grew later the streets became more filled and the\r\ntraffic greater. At last they got on the road to Chingford, and caught\r\nup numbers of other vehicles going in the same direction--donkey-shays,\r\npony-carts, tradesmen\'s carts, dog-carts, drags, brakes, every\r\nconceivable kind of wheel thing, all filled with people, the\r\nwretched donkey dragging along four solid rate-payers to the pair\r\nof stout horses easily managing a couple of score. They exchanged\r\ncheers and greetings as they passed, the \'Red Lion\' brake being\r\nnoticeable above all for its uproariousness. As the day wore on\r\nthe sun became hotter, and the road seemed more dusty and threw up a\r\ngreater heat.\r\n\r\n\'I am getting \'ot!\' was the common cry, and everyone began to puff and\r\nsweat.\r\n\r\nThe ladies removed their cloaks and capes, and the men, following\r\ntheir example, took off their coats and sat in their shirt-sleeves.\r\nWhereupon ensued much banter of a not particularly edifying kind\r\nrespecting the garments which each person would like to remove--which\r\nshowed that the innuendo of French farce is not so unknown to the\r\nupright, honest Englishman as might be supposed.\r\n\r\nAt last came in sight the half-way house, where the horses were to\r\nhave a rest and a sponge down. They had been talking of it for the\r\nlast quarter of a mile, and when at length it was observed on the top\r\nof a hill a cheer broke out, and some thirsty wag began to sing \'Rule\r\nBritannia\', whilst others burst forth with a different national ditty,\r\n\'Beer, Glorious Beer!\' They drew up before the pub entrance, and all\r\nclimbed down as quickly as they could. The bar was besieged, and\r\npotmen and barmaids were quickly busy drawing beer and handing it over\r\nto the eager folk outside.\r\n\r\nTHE IDYLL OF CORYDON AND PHYLLIS.\r\n\r\nGallantry ordered that the faithful swain and the amorous shepherdess\r\nshould drink out of one and the same pot.\r\n\r\n\'\'Urry up an\' \'ave your whack,\' said Corydon, politely handing the\r\nfoaming bowl for his fair one to drink from.\r\n\r\nPhyllis, without replying, raised it to her lips and drank deep. The\r\nswain watched anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere, give us a chanst!\' he said, as the pot was raised higher and\r\nhigher and its contents appeared to be getting less and less.\r\n\r\nAt this the amorous shepherdess stopped and handed the pot to her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m dashed!\' said Corydon, looking into it; and added: \'I guess\r\nyou know a thing or two.\' Then with courtly grace putting his own lips\r\nto the place where had been those of his beloved, finished the pint.\r\n\r\n\'Go\' lumme!\' remarked the shepherdess, smacking her lips, \'that was\r\nsomethin\' like!\' And she put out her tongue and licked her lips, and\r\nthen breathed deeply.\r\n\r\nThe faithful swain having finished, gave a long sigh, and said:\r\n\r\n\'Well, I could do with some more!\'\r\n\r\n\'For the matter of thet, I could do with a gargle!\'\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, the gallant returned to the bar, and soon brought out\r\na second pint.\r\n\r\n\'You \'ave fust pop,\' amorously remarked Phyllis, and he took a long\r\ndrink and handed the pot to her.\r\n\r\nShe, with maiden modesty, turned it so as to have a different part to\r\ndrink from; but he remarked as he saw her:\r\n\r\n\'You are bloomin\' particular.\'\r\n\r\nThen, unwilling to grieve him, she turned it back again and applied\r\nher ruby lips to the place where his had been.\r\n\r\n\'Now we shan\'t be long!\' she remarked, as she handed him back the pot.\r\n\r\nThe faithful swain took out of his pocket a short clay pipe, blew\r\nthrough it, filled it, and began to smoke, while Phyllis sighed at the\r\nthought of the cool liquid gliding down her throat, and with the\r\npleasing recollection gently stroked her stomach. Then Corydon spat,\r\nand immediately his love said:\r\n\r\n\'I can spit farther than thet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I bet yer yer can\'t.\'\r\n\r\nShe tried, and did. He collected himself and spat again, further than\r\nbefore, she followed him, and in this idyllic contest they remained\r\ntill the tootling horn warned them to take their places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt last they reached Chingford, and here the horses were taken out and\r\nthe drag, on which they were to lunch, drawn up in a sheltered spot.\r\nThey were all rather hungry, but as it was not yet feeding-time, they\r\nscattered to have drinks meanwhile. Liza and Tom, with Sally and her\r\nyoung man, went off together to the nearest public-house, and as they\r\ndrank beer, Harry, who was a great sportsman, gave them a graphic\r\naccount of a prize-fight he had seen on the previous Saturday evening,\r\nwhich had been rendered specially memorable by one man being so hurt\r\nthat he had died from the effects. It had evidently been a very fine\r\naffair, and Harry said that several swells from the West End had been\r\npresent, and he related their ludicrous efforts to get in without\r\nbeing seen by anyone, and their terror when someone to frighten them\r\ncalled out \'Copper!\' Then Tom and he entered into a discussion on the\r\nsubject of boxing, in which Tom, being a shy and undogmatic sort of\r\nperson, was entirely worsted. After this they strolled back to the\r\nbrake, and found things being prepared for luncheon; the hampers were\r\nbrought out and emptied, and the bottles of beer in great profusion\r\nmade many a thirsty mouth thirstier.\r\n\r\n\'Come along, lidies an\' gentlemen--if you are gentlemen,\' shouted the\r\ncoachman; \'the animals is now goin\' ter be fed!\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn awy,\' answered somebody, \'we\'re not hanimals; we don\'t drink\r\nwater.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re too clever,\' remarked the coachman; \'I can see you\'ve just\r\ncome from the board school.\'\r\n\r\nAs the former speaker was a lady of quite mature appearance, the\r\nremark was not without its little irony. The other man blew his horn\r\nby way of grace, at which Liza called out to him:\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t do thet, you\'ll bust, I know you will, an\' if you bust you\'ll\r\nquite spoil my dinner!\'\r\n\r\nThen they all set to. Pork-pies, saveloys, sausages, cold potatoes,\r\nhard-boiled eggs, cold bacon, veal, ham, crabs and shrimps, cheese,\r\nbutter, cold suet-puddings and treacle, gooseberry-tarts,\r\ncherry-tarts, butter, bread, more sausages, and yet again pork-pies!\r\nThey devoured the provisions like ravening beasts, stolidly, silently,\r\nearnestly, in large mouthfuls which they shoved down their throats\r\nunmasticated. The intelligent foreigner seeing them thus dispose of\r\ntheir food would have understood why England is a great nation. He\r\nwould have understood why Britons never, never will be slaves. They\r\nnever stopped except to drink, and then at each gulp they emptied\r\ntheir glass; no heel-taps! And still they ate, and still they\r\ndrank--but as all things must cease, they stopped at last, and a long\r\nsigh of content broke from their two-and-thirty throats.\r\n\r\nThen the gathering broke up, and the good folk paired themselves and\r\nseparated. Harry and his lady strolled off to secluded byways in the\r\nforest, so that they might discourse of their loves and digest their\r\ndinner. Tom had all the morning been waiting for this happy moment; he\r\nhad counted on the expansive effect of a full stomach to thaw his\r\nLiza\'s coldness, and he had pictured himself sitting on the grass with\r\nhis back against the trunk of a spreading chestnut-tree, with his arm\r\nround his Liza\'s waist, and her head resting affectionately on his\r\nmanly bosom. Liza, too, had foreseen the separation into couples after\r\ndinner, and had been racking her brains to find a means of getting out\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want \'im slobberin\' abaht me,\' she said; \'it gives me the\r\nsick, all this kissin\' an\' cuddlin\'!\'\r\n\r\nShe scarcely knew why she objected to his caresses; but they bored her\r\nand made her cross. But luckily the blessed institution of marriage\r\ncame to her rescue, for Jim and his wife naturally had no particular\r\ndesire to spend the afternoon together, and Liza, seeing a little\r\nembarrassment on their part, proposed that they should go for a walk\r\ntogether in the forest.\r\n\r\nJim agreed at once, and with pleasure, but Tom was dreadfully\r\ndisappointed. He hadn\'t the courage to say anything, but he glared at\r\nBlakeston. Jim smiled benignly at him, and Tom began to sulk. Then\r\nthey began a funny walk through the woods. Jim tried to go on with\r\nLiza, and Liza was not at all disinclined to this, for she had come to\r\nthe conclusion that Jim, notwithstanding his \'cheek\', was not \'\'alf a\r\nbad sort\'. But Tom kept walking alongside of them, and as Jim slightly\r\nquickened his pace so as to get Liza on in front, Tom quickened his,\r\nand Mrs. Blakeston, who didn\'t want to be left behind, had to break\r\ninto a little trot to keep up with them. Jim tried also to get Liza\r\nall to himself in the conversation, and let Tom see that he was out in\r\nthe cold, but Tom would break in with cross, sulky remarks, just to\r\nmake the others uncomfortable. Liza at last got rather vexed with him.\r\n\r\n\'Strikes me you got aht of bed the wrong way this mornin\',\' she said\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\'Yer didn\'t think thet when yer said you\'d come aht with me.\' He\r\nemphasized the \'me\'.\r\n\r\nLiza shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'You give me the \'ump,\' she said. \'If yer wants ter mike a fool of\r\nyerself, you can go elsewhere an\' do it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I suppose yer want me ter go awy now,\' he said angrily.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t say I did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, Liza, I won\'t stay where I\'m not wanted.\' And turning on\r\nhis heel he marched off, striking through the underwood into the midst\r\nof the forest.\r\n\r\nHe felt extremely unhappy as he wandered on, and there was a choky\r\nfeeling in his throat as he thought of Liza: she was very unkind and\r\nungrateful, and he wished he had never come to Chingford. She might so\r\neasily have come for a walk with him instead of going with that beast\r\nof a Blakeston; she wouldn\'t ever do anything for him, and he hated\r\nher--but all the same, he was a poor foolish thing in love, and he\r\nbegan to feel that perhaps he had been a little exacting and a little\r\nforward to take offence. And then he wished he had never said\r\nanything, and he wanted so much to see her and make it up. He made his\r\nway back to Chingford, hoping she would not make him wait too long.\r\n\r\nLiza was a little surprised when Tom turned and left them.\r\n\r\n\'Wot \'as \'e got the needle abaht?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Why, \'e\'s jealous,\' answered Jim, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\'Tom jealous?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus; \'e\'s jealous of me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, \'e ain\'t got no cause ter be jealous of anyone--that \'e ain\'t!\'\r\nsaid Liza, and continued by telling him all about Tom: how he had\r\nwanted to marry her and she wouldn\'t have him, and how she had only\r\nagreed to come to Chingford with him on the understanding that she\r\nshould preserve her entire freedom. Jim listened sympathetically, but\r\nhis wife paid no attention; she was doubtless engaged in thought\r\nrespecting her household or her family.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to Chingford they saw Tom standing in solitude\r\nlooking at them. Liza was struck by the woebegone expression on his\r\nface; she felt she had been cruel to him, and leaving the Blakestons\r\nwent up to him.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Tom,\' she said, \'don\'t tike on so; I didn\'t mean it.\'\r\n\r\nHe was bursting to apologize for his behaviour.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Tom,\' she went on, \'I\'m rather \'asty, an\' I\'m sorry I said\r\nwot I did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Liza, you are good! You ain\'t cross with me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me? Na; it\'s you thet oughter be cross.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are a good sort, Liza!\'\r\n\r\n\'You ain\'t vexed with me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Give me Liza every time; that\'s wot I say,\' he answered, as his face\r\nlit up. \'Come along an\' \'ave tea, an\' then we\'ll go for a\r\ndonkey-ride.\'\r\n\r\nThe donkey-ride was a great success. Liza was a little afraid at\r\nfirst, so Tom walked by her side to take care of her, she screamed the\r\nmoment the beast began to trot, and clutched hold of Tom to save\r\nherself from falling, and as he felt her hand on his shoulder, and\r\nheard her appealing cry: \'Oh, do \'old me! I\'m fallin\'!\' he felt that\r\nhe had never in his life been so deliciously happy. The whole party\r\njoined in, and it was proposed that they should have races; but in the\r\nfirst heat, when the donkeys broke into a canter, Liza fell off into\r\nTom\'s arms and the donkeys scampered on without her.\r\n\r\n\'I know wot I\'ll do,\' she said, when the runaway had been recovered.\r\n\'I\'ll ride \'im straddlewyse.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' said Sally, \'yer can\'t with petticoats.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I can, an\' I will too!\'\r\n\r\nSo another donkey was procured, this time with a man\'s saddle, and\r\nputting her foot in the stirrup, she cocked her leg over and took her\r\nseat triumphantly. Neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be reckoned\r\namong Liza\'s faults, and in this position she felt quite at ease.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll git along arright now, Tom,\' she said; \'you garn and\r\ngit yerself a moke, and come an\' jine in.\'\r\n\r\nThe next race was perfectly uproarious. Liza kicked and beat her\r\ndonkey with all her might, shrieking and laughing the white, and\r\nfinally came in winner by a length. After that they felt rather warm\r\nand dry, and repaired to the public-house to restore themselves and\r\ntalk over the excitements of the racecourse.\r\n\r\nWhen they had drunk several pints of beer Liza and Sally, with their\r\nrespective adorers and the Blakestons, walked round to find other\r\nmeans of amusing themselves; they were arrested by a coconut-shy.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, let\'s \'ave a shy!\' said Liza, excitedly, at which the unlucky men\r\nhad to pull out their coppers, while Sally and Liza made ludicrously\r\nbad shots at the coconuts.\r\n\r\n\'It looks so bloomin\' easy,\' said Liza, brushing up her hair, \'but I\r\ncan\'t \'it the blasted thing. You \'ave a shot, Tom.\'\r\n\r\nHe and Harry were equally unskilful, but Jim got three coconuts\r\nrunning, and the proprietors of the show began to look on him with\r\nsome concern.\r\n\r\n\'You are a dab at it,\' said Liza, in admiration.\r\n\r\nThey tried to induce Mrs. Blakeston to try her luck, but she stoutly\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t old with such foolishness. It\'s wiste of money ter me,\' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\'Na then, don\'t crack on, old tart,\' remarked her husband, \'let\'s go\r\nan\' eat the coconuts.\'\r\n\r\nThere was one for each couple, and after the ladies had sucked the\r\njuice they divided them and added their respective shares to their\r\ndinners and teas. Supper came next. Again they fell to sausage-rolls,\r\nboiled eggs, and saveloys, and countless bottles of beer were added to\r\nthose already drunk.\r\n\r\n\'I dunno \'ow many bottles of beer I\'ve drunk--I\'ve lost count,\' said\r\nLiza; whereat there was a general laugh.\r\n\r\nThey still had an hour before the brake was to start back, and it was\r\nthen the concertinas came in useful. They sat down on the grass, and\r\nthe concert was begun by Harry, who played a solo; then there was a\r\ncall for a song, and Jim stood up and sang that ancient ditty, \'O dem\r\nGolden Kippers, O\'. There was no shyness in the company, and Liza,\r\nalmost without being asked, gave another popular comic song. Then\r\nthere was more concertina playing, and another demand for a song. Liza\r\nturned to Tom, who was sitting quietly by her side.\r\n\r\n\'Give us a song, old cock,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t,\' he answered. \'I\'m not a singin\' sort.\' At which Blakeston\r\ngot up and offered to sing again.\r\n\r\n\'Tom is rather a soft,\' said Liza to herself, \'not like that cove\r\nBlakeston.\'\r\n\r\nThey repaired to the public-house to have a few last drinks before the\r\nbrake started, and when the horn blew to warn them, rather unsteadily,\r\nthey proceeded to take their places.\r\n\r\nLiza, as she scrambled up the steps, said: \'Well, I believe I\'m\r\nboozed.\'\r\n\r\nThe coachman had arrived at the melancholy stage of intoxication, and\r\nwas sitting on his box holding his reins, with his head bent on his\r\nchest. He was thinking sadly of the long-lost days of his youth, and\r\nwishing he had been a better man.\r\n\r\nLiza had no respect for such holy emotions, and she brought down her\r\nfist on the crown of his hat, and bashed it over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Na then, old jellybelly,\' she said, \'wot\'s the good of \'avin\' a fice\r\nas long as a kite?\'\r\n\r\nHe turned round and smote her.\r\n\r\n\'Jellybelly yerself!\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'Puddin\' fice!\' she cried.\r\n\r\n\'Kite fice!\'\r\n\r\n\'Boss eye!\'\r\n\r\nShe was tremendously excited, laughing and singing, keeping the whole\r\ncompany in an uproar. In her jollity she had changed hats with Tom,\r\nand he in her big feathers made her shriek with laughter. When they\r\nstarted they began to sing \'For \'e\'s a jolly good feller\', making the\r\nnight resound with their noisy voices.\r\n\r\nLiza and Tom and the Blakestons had got a seat together, Liza being\r\nbetween the two men. Tom was perfectly happy, and only wished that\r\nthey might go on so for ever. Gradually as they drove along they\r\nbecame quieter, their singing ceased, and they talked in undertones.\r\nSome of them slept; Sally and her young man were leaning up against\r\none another, slumbering quite peacefully. The night was beautiful, the\r\nsky still blue, very dark, scattered over with countless brilliant\r\nstars, and Liza, as she looked up at the heavens, felt a certain\r\nemotion, as if she wished to be taken in someone\'s arms, or feel some\r\nstrong man\'s caress; and there was in her heart a strange sensation as\r\nthough it were growing big. She stopped speaking, and all four were\r\nsilent. Then slowly she felt Tom\'s arm steal round her waist,\r\ncautiously, as though it were afraid of being there; this time both\r\nshe and Tom were happy. But suddenly there was a movement on the other\r\nside of her, a hand was advanced along her leg, and her hand was\r\ngrasped and gently pressed. It was Jim Blakeston. She started a little\r\nand began trembling so that Tom noticed it, and whispered:\r\n\r\n\'You\'re cold, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I\'m not, Tom; it\'s only a sort of shiver thet went through me.\'\r\n\r\nHis arm gave her waist a squeeze, and at the same time the big rough\r\nhand pressed her little one. And so she sat between them till they\r\nreached the \'Red Lion\' in the Westminster Bridge Road, and Tom said to\r\nhimself: \'I believe she does care for me after all.\'\r\n\r\nWhen they got down they all said good night, and Sally and Liza, with\r\ntheir respective slaves and the Blakestons, marched off homewards. At\r\nthe corner of Vere Street Harry said to Tom and Blakeston:\r\n\r\n\'I say, you blokes, let\'s go an\' \'ave another drink before closin\'\r\ntime.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind,\' said Tom, \'after we\'ve took the gals \'ome.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then we shan\'t \'ave time, it\'s just on closin\' time now.\' answered\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we can\'t leave \'em \'ere.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, you can,\' said Sally. \'No one\'ll run awy with us.\'\r\n\r\nTom did not want to part from Liza, but she broke in with:\r\n\r\n\'Yus, go on, Tom. Sally an\' me\'ll git along arright, an\' you ain\'t got\r\ntoo much time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, good night, \'Arry,\' said Sally to settle the matter.\r\n\r\n\'Good night, old gal,\' he answered, \'give us another slobber.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she, not at all unwilling, surrendered herself to him, while he\r\nimprinted two sounding kisses on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\'Good night, Tom,\' said Liza, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Good night, Liza,\' he answered, taking it, but looking very wistfully\r\nat her.\r\n\r\nShe understood, and with a kindly smile lifted up her face to him. He\r\nbent down and, taking her in his arms, kissed her passionately.\r\n\r\n\'You do kiss nice, Liza,\' he said, making the others laugh.\r\n\r\n\'Thanks for tikin\' me aht, old man,\' she said as they parted.\r\n\r\n\'Arright, Liza,\' he answered, and added, almost to himself: \'God bless\r\nyer!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa, Blakeston, ain\'t you comin\'?\' said Harry, seeing that Jim was\r\nwalking off with his wife instead of joining him and Tom.\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' he answered, \'I\'m goin\' \'ome. I\'ve got ter be up at five\r\nter-morrer.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are a chap!\' said Harry, disgustedly, strolling off with Tom to\r\nthe pub, while the others made their way down the sleeping street.\r\n\r\nThe house where Sally lived came first, and she left them; then,\r\nwalking a few yards more, they came to the Blakestons\', and after a\r\nlittle talk at the door Liza bade the couple good night, and was left\r\nto walk the rest of the way home. The street was perfectly silent, and\r\nthe lamp-posts, far apart, threw a dim light which only served to make\r\nLisa realize her solitude. There was such a difference between the\r\nstreet at midday, with its swarms of people, and now, when there was\r\nneither sound nor soul besides herself, that even she was struck by\r\nit. The regular line of houses on either side, with the even pavements\r\nand straight, cemented road, seemed to her like some desert place, as\r\nif everyone were dead, or a fire had raged and left it all desolate.\r\nSuddenly she heard a footstep, she started and looked back. It was a\r\nman hurrying behind her, and in a moment she had recognized Jim. He\r\nbeckoned to her, and in a low voice called:\r\n\r\n\'Liza!\'\r\n\r\nShe stopped till he had come up to her.\r\n\r\n\'Wot \'ave yer come aht again for?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve come aht ter say good night to you, Liza,\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'But yer said good night a moment ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wanted to say it again--properly.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where\'s yer missus?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, she\'s gone in. I said I was dry and was goin\' ter \'ave a drink\r\nafter all.\'\r\n\r\n\'But she\'ll know yer didn\'t go ter the pub.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, she won\'t, she\'s gone straight upstairs to see after the kid. I\r\nwanted ter see yer alone, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\'\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t answer, but tried to take hold of her hand. She drew it away\r\nquickly. They walked in silence till they came to Liza\'s house.\r\n\r\n\'Good night,\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Won\'t you come for a little walk, Liza?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tike care no one \'ears you,\' she added, in a whisper, though why she\r\nwhispered she did not know.\r\n\r\n\'Will yer?\' he asked again.\r\n\r\n\'Na--you\'ve got to get up at five.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I only said thet not ter go inter the pub with them.\'\r\n\r\n\'So as yer might come \'ere with me?\' asked Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'m not comin\'. Good night.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, say good night nicely.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot d\'yer mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom said you did kiss nice.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked at him without speaking, and in a moment he had clasped his\r\narms round her, almost lifting her off her feet, and kissed her. She\r\nturned her face away.\r\n\r\n\'Give us yer lips, Liza,\' he whispered--\'give us yer lips.\'\r\n\r\nHe turned her face without resistance and kissed her on the mouth.\r\n\r\nAt last she tore herself from him, and opening the door slid away into\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning on her way to the factory Liza came up with Sally. They\r\nwere both of them rather stale and bedraggled after the day\'s outing;\r\ntheir fringes were ragged and untidily straying over their foreheads,\r\ntheir back hair, carelessly tied in a loose knot, fell over their\r\nnecks and threatened completely to come down. Liza had not had time to\r\nput her hat on, and was holding it in her hand. Sally\'s was pinned on\r\nsideways, and she had to bash it down on her head every now and then\r\nto prevent its coming off. Cinderella herself was not more transformed\r\nthan they were; but Cinderella even in her rags was virtuously tidy\r\nand patched up, while Sally had a great tear in her shabby dress, and\r\nLiza\'s stockings were falling over her boots.\r\n\r\n\'Wot cheer, Sal!\' said Liza, when she caught her up.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I \'ave got sich a \'ead on me this mornin\'!\' she remarked, turning\r\nround a pale face: heavily lined under the eyes.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t feel too chirpy neither,\' said Liza, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I \'adn\'t drunk so much beer,\' added Sally, as a pang shot\r\nthrough her head.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you\'ll be arright in a bit,\' said Liza. Just then they heard the\r\nclock strike eight, and they began to run so that they might not miss\r\ngetting their tokens and thereby their day\'s pay; they turned into the\r\nstreet at the end of which was the factory, and saw half a hundred\r\nwomen running like themselves to get in before it was too late.\r\n\r\nAll the morning Liza worked in a dead-and-alive sort of fashion, her\r\nhead like a piece of lead with electric shocks going through it when\r\nshe moved, and her tongue and mouth hot and dry. At last lunch-time\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\'Come on, Sal,\' said Liza, \'I\'m goin\' to \'ave a glass o\' bitter. I\r\ncan\'t stand this no longer.\'\r\n\r\nSo they entered the public-house opposite, and in one draught finished\r\ntheir pots. Liza gave a long sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\'That bucks you up, don\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I was dry! I ain\'t told yer yet, Liza, \'ave I? \'E got it aht last\r\nnight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who d\'yer mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, \'Arry. \'E spit it aht at last.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arst yer ter nime the day?\' said Liza, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And did yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t I jest!\' answered Sally, with some emphasis. \'I always told\r\nyer I\'d git off before you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus!\' said Liza, thinking.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Liza, you\'d better tike Tom; \'e ain\'t a bad sort.\' She was\r\nquite patronizing.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m goin\' ter tike \'oo I like; an\' it ain\'t nobody\'s business but\r\nmine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, Liza, don\'t get shirty over it; I don\'t mean no offence.\'\r\n\r\n\'What d\'yer say it for then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I thought as seeing as yer\'d gone aht with \'im yesterday thet\r\nyer meant ter after all.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E wanted ter tike me; I didn\'t arsk \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I didn\'t arsk my \'Arry, either.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never said yer did,\' replied Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you\'ve got the \'ump, you \'ave!\' finished Sally, rather angrily.\r\n\r\nThe beer had restored Liza: she went back to work without a headache,\r\nand, except for a slight languor, feeling no worse for the previous\r\nday\'s debauch. As she worked on she began going over in her mind the\r\nevents of the preceding day, and she found entwined in all her\r\nthoughts the burly person of Jim Blakeston. She saw him walking by her\r\nside in the Forest, presiding over the meals, playing the concertina,\r\nsinging, joking, and finally, on the drive back, she felt the heavy\r\nform by her side, and the big, rough hand holding hers, while Tom\'s\r\narm was round her waist. Tom! That was the first time he had entered\r\nher mind, and he sank into a shadow beside the other. Last of all she\r\nremembered the walk home from the pub, the good nights, and the rapid\r\nfootsteps as Jim caught her up, and the kiss. She blushed and looked\r\nup quickly to see whether any of the girls were looking at her; she\r\ncould not help thinking of that moment when he took her in his arms;\r\nshe still felt the roughness of his beard pressing on her mouth. Her\r\nheart seemed to grow larger in her breast, and she caught for breath\r\nas she threw back her head as if to receive his lips again. A shudder\r\nran through her from the vividness of the thought.\r\n\r\n\'Wot are you shiverin\' for, Liza?\' asked one of the girls. \'You ain\'t\r\ncold.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not much,\' answered Liza, blushing awkwardly on her meditations being\r\nbroken into. \'Why, I\'m sweatin\' so--I\'m drippin\' wet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I expect yer caught cold in the Faurest yesterday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see your mash as I was comin\' along this mornin\'.\'\r\n\r\nLiza stared a little.\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t got one, \'oo d\'yer mean, ay?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer only Tom, of course. \'E did look washed aht. Wot was yer doin\'\r\nwith \'im yesterday?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E ain\'t got nothin\' ter do with me, \'e ain\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn, don\'t you tell me!\'\r\n\r\nThe bell rang, and, throwing over their work, the girls trooped off,\r\nand after chattering in groups outside the factory gates for a while,\r\nmade their way in different directions to their respective homes. Liza\r\nand Sally went along together.\r\n\r\n\'I sy, we are comin\' aht!\' cried Sally, seeing the advertisement of a\r\nplay being acted at the neighbouring theatre.\r\n\r\n\'I should like ter see thet!\' said Liza, as they stood arm-in-arm in\r\nfront of the flaring poster. It represented two rooms and a passage in\r\nbetween; in one room a dead man was lying on the floor, while two\r\nothers were standing horror-stricken, listening to a youth who was in\r\nthe passage, knocking at the door.\r\n\r\n\'You see, they\'ve \'killed im,\' said Sally, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, any fool can see thet! an\' the one ahtside, wot\'s \'e doin\' of?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t \'e beautiful? I\'ll git my \'Arry ter tike me, I will. I should\r\nlike ter see it. \'E said \'e\'d tike me to the ply.\'\r\n\r\nThey strolled on again, and Liza, leaving Sally, made her way to her\r\nmother\'s. She knew she must pass Jim\'s house, and wondered whether she\r\nwould see him. But as she walked along the street she saw Tom coming\r\nthe opposite way; with a sudden impulse she turned back so as not to\r\nmeet him, and began walking the way she had come. Then thinking\r\nherself a fool for what she had done, she turned again and walked\r\ntowards him. She wondered if she had seen her or noticed her movement,\r\nbut when she looked down the street he was nowhere to be seen; he had\r\nnot caught sight of her, and had evidently gone in to see a mate in\r\none or other of the houses. She quickened her step, and passing the\r\nhouse where lived Jim, could not help looking up; he was standing at\r\nthe door watching her, with a smile on his lips.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t see yer, Mr. Blakeston,\' she said, as he came up to her.\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t yer? Well, I knew yer would; an\' I was witin\' for yer ter look\r\nup. I see yer before ter-day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, when?\'\r\n\r\n\'I passed be\'ind yer as you an\' thet other girl was lookin\' at the\r\nadvertisement of thet ply.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never see yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I know yer didn\'t. I \'ear yer say, you says: "I should like to\r\nsee thet."\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, an\' I should too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll tike yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'You?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus; why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'I like thet; wot would yer missus sy?\'\r\n\r\n\'She wouldn\'t know.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the neighbours would!\'\r\n\r\n\'No they wouldn\'t, no one \'d see us.\'\r\n\r\nHe was speaking in a low voice so that people could not hear.\r\n\r\n\'You could meet me ahtside the theatre,\' he went on.\r\n\r\n\'Na, I couldn\'t go with you; you\'re a married man.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! wot\'s the matter--jest ter go ter the ply? An\' besides, my\r\nmissus can\'t come if she wanted, she\'s got the kids ter look after.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like ter see it,\' said Liza meditatively.\r\n\r\nThey had reached her house, and Jim said:\r\n\r\n\'Well, come aht this evenin\' and tell me if yer will--eh, Liza?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I\'m not comin\' aht this evening.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet won\'t \'urt yer. I shall wite for yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Tain\'t a bit of good your witing\', \'cause I shan\'t come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, look \'ere, Liza; next Saturday night\'s the last night,\r\nan\' I shall go to the theatre, any\'ow. An\' if you\'ll come, you just\r\ncome to the door at \'alf-past six, an\' you\'ll find me there. See?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I don\'t,\' said Liza, firmly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I shall expect yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t come, so you needn\'t expect.\' And with that she walked into\r\nthe house and slammed the door behind her.\r\n\r\nHer mother had not come in from her day\'s charing, and Liza set about\r\ngetting her tea. She thought it would be rather lonely eating it\r\nalone, so pouring out a cup of tea and putting a little condensed milk\r\ninto it, she cut a huge piece of bread-and-butter, and sat herself\r\ndown outside on the doorstep. Another woman came downstairs, and\r\nseeing Liza, sat down by her side and began to talk.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Mrs. Stanley, wot \'ave yer done to your \'ead?\' asked Liza,\r\nnoticing a bandage round her forehead.\r\n\r\n\'I \'ad an accident last night,\' answered the woman, blushing uneasily.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am sorry! Wot did yer do to yerself?\'\r\n\r\n\'I fell against the coal-scuttle and cut my \'ead open.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I never!\'\r\n\r\n\'To tell yer the truth, I \'ad a few words with my old man. But one\r\ndoesn\'t like them things to get abaht; yer won\'t tell anyone, will\r\nyer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not me!\' answered Liza. \'I didn\'t know yer husband was like thet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, \'e\'s as gentle as a lamb when \'e\'s sober,\' said Mrs. Stanley,\r\napologetically. \'But, Lor\' bless yer, when \'e\'s \'ad a drop too much\r\n\'e\'s a demond, an\' there\'s no two ways abaht it.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' you ain\'t been married long neither?\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Na, not above eighteen months; ain\'t it disgriceful? Thet\'s wot the\r\ndoctor at the \'orspital says ter me. I \'ad ter go ter the \'orspital.\r\nYou should have seen \'ow it bled!--it bled all dahn\' my fice, and went\r\nstreamin\' like a bust waterpipe. Well, it fair frightened my old man,\r\nan\' I says ter \'im, "I\'ll charge yer," an\' although I was bleedin\'\r\nlike a bloomin\' pig I shook my fist at \'im, an\' I says, "I\'ll charge\r\nye--see if I don\'t!" An\' \'e says, "Na," says \'e, "don\'t do thet, for\r\nGod\'s sike, Kitie, I\'ll git three months." "An\' serve yer damn well\r\nright!" says I, an\' I went aht an\' left \'im. But, Lor\' bless yer, I\r\nwouldn\'t charge \'im! I know \'e don\'t mean it; \'e\'s as gentle as a lamb\r\nwhen \'e\'s sober.\' She smiled quite affectionately as she said this.\r\n\r\n\'Wot did yer do, then?\' asked Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Well, as I wos tellin\' yer, I went to the \'orspital, an\' the doctor\r\n\'e says to me, "My good woman," says \'e, "you might have been very\r\nseriously injured." An\' me not been married eighteen months! An\' as I\r\nwas tellin\' the doctor all about it, "Missus," \'e says ter me, lookin\'\r\nat me straight in the eyeball. "Missus," says \'e, "\'ave you been\r\ndrinkin\'?" "Drinkin\'?" says I; "no! I\'ve \'ad a little drop, but as for\r\ndrinkin\'! Mind," says I, "I don\'t say I\'m a teetotaller--I\'m not, I\r\n\'ave my glass of beer, and I like it. I couldn\'t do withaht it, wot\r\nwith the work I \'ave, I must \'ave somethin\' ter keep me tergether. But\r\nas for drinkin\' \'eavily! Well! I can say this, there ain\'t a soberer\r\nwoman than myself in all London. Why, my first \'usband never touched a\r\ndrop. Ah, my first \'usband, \'e was a beauty, \'e was."\'\r\n\r\nShe stopped the repetition of her conversation and addressed herself\r\nto Liza.\r\n\r\n\'\'E was thet different ter this one. \'E was a man as \'ad seen better\r\ndays. \'E was a gentleman!\' She mouthed the word and emphasized it with\r\nan expressive nod.\r\n\r\n\'\'E was a gentleman and a Christian. \'E\'d been in good circumstances\r\nin \'is time; an\' \'e was a man of education and a teetotaller, for\r\ntwenty-two years.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment Liza\'s mother appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\n\'Good evenin\', Mrs. Stanley,\' she said, politely.\r\n\r\n\'The sime ter you, Mrs. Kemp.\' replied that lady, with equal courtesy.\r\n\r\n\'An\' \'ow is your poor \'ead?\' asked Liza\'s mother, with sympathy.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s been achin\' cruel. I\'ve hardly known wot ter do with\r\nmyself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure \'e ought ter be ashimed of \'imself for treatin\' yer like\r\nthet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it wasn\'t \'is blows I minded so much, Mrs. Kemp,\' replied Mrs.\r\nStanley, \'an\' don\'t you think it. It was wot \'e said ter me. I can\r\nstand a blow as well as any woman. I don\'t mind thet, an\' when \'e\r\ndon\'t tike a mean advantage of me I can stand up for myself an\' give\r\nas good as I tike; an\' many\'s the time I give my fust husband a black\r\neye. But the language \'e used, an\' the things \'e called me! It made me\r\nblush to the roots of my \'air; I\'m not used ter bein\' spoken ter like\r\nthet. I was in good circumstances when my fust \'usband was alive, \'e\r\nearned between two an\' three pound a week, \'e did. As I said to \'im\r\nthis mornin\', "\'Ow a gentleman can use sich language, I dunno."\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Usbands is cautions, \'owever good they are,\' said Mrs. Kemp,\r\naphoristically. \'But I mustn\'t stay aht \'ere in the night air.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'As yer rheumatism been troublin\' yer litely?\' asked Mrs. Stanley.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, cruel. Liza rubs me with embrocation every night, but it torments\r\nme cruel.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp then went into the house, and Liza remained talking to Mrs.\r\nStanley, she, too, had to go in, and Liza was left alone. Some while\r\nshe spent thinking of nothing, staring vacantly in front of her,\r\nenjoying the cool and quiet of the evening. But Liza could not be left\r\nalone long, several boys came along with a bat and a ball, and fixed\r\nupon the road just in front of her for their pitch. Taking off their\r\ncoats they piled them up at the two ends, and were ready to begin.\r\n\r\n\'I say, old gal,\' said one of them to Liza, \'come an\' have a gime of\r\ncricket, will yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Bob, I\'m tired.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come on!\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I tell you I won\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'She was on the booze yesterday, an\' she ain\'t got over it,\' cried\r\nanother boy.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll swipe yer over the snitch!\' replied Liza to him, and then on\r\nbeing asked again, said:\r\n\r\n\'Leave me alone, won\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Liza\'s got the needle ter-night, thet\'s flat,\' commented a third\r\nmember of the team.\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t drink if I was you, Liza,\' added another, with mock\r\ngravity. \'It\'s a bad \'abit ter git into,\' and he began rolling and\r\nswaying about like a drunken man.\r\n\r\nIf Liza had been \'in form\' she would have gone straight away and given\r\nthe whole lot of them a sample of her strength; but she was only\r\nrather bored and vexed that they should disturb her quietness, so she\r\nlet them talk. They saw she was not to be drawn, and leaving her, set\r\nto their game. She watched them for some time, but her thoughts\r\ngradually lost themselves, and insensibly her mind was filled with a\r\nburly form, and she was again thinking of Jim.\r\n\r\n\'\'E is a good sort ter want ter tike me ter the ply,\' she said to\r\nherself. \'Tom never arst me!\'\r\n\r\nJim had said he would come out in the evening; he ought to be here\r\nsoon, she thought. Of course she wasn\'t going to the theatre with him,\r\nbut she didn\'t mind talking to him; she rather enjoyed being asked to\r\ndo a thing and refusing, and she would have liked another opportunity\r\nof doing so. But he didn\'t come and he had said he would!\r\n\r\n\'I say, Bill,\' she said at last to one of the boys who was fielding\r\nclose beside her, \'that there Blakeston--d\'you know \'im?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, rather; why, he works at the sime plice as me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s \'e do with \'isself in the evening; I never see \'im abaht?\'\r\n\r\n\'I dunno. I see \'im this evenin\' go into the "Red Lion". I suppose\r\n\'e\'s there, but I dunno.\'\r\n\r\nThen he wasn\'t coming. Of course she had told him she was going to\r\nstay indoors, but he might have come all the same--just to see.\r\n\r\n\'I know Tom \'ud \'ave come,\' she said to herself, rather sulkily.\r\n\r\n\'Liza! Liza!\' she heard her mother\'s voice calling her.\r\n\r\n\'Arright, I\'m comin\',\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been witin\' for you this last \'alf-hour ter rub me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why didn\'t yer call?\' asked Liza.\r\n\r\n\'I did call. I\'ve been callin\' this last I dunno \'ow long; it\'s give\r\nme quite a sore throat.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never \'eard yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, yer didn\'t want ter \'ear me, did yer? Yer don\'t mind if I dies\r\nwith rheumatics, do yer? I know.\'\r\n\r\nLiza did not answer, but took the bottle, and, pouring some of the\r\nliniment on her hand, began to rub it into Mrs. Kemp\'s rheumatic\r\njoints, while the invalid kept complaining and grumbling at everything\r\nLiza did.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t rub so \'ard, Liza, you\'ll rub all the skin off.\'\r\n\r\nThen when Liza did it as gently as she could, she grumbled again.\r\n\r\n\'If yer do it like thet, it won\'t do no good at all. You want ter sive\r\nyerself trouble--I know yer. When I was young girls didn\'t mind a\r\nlittle bit of \'ard work--but, law bless yer, you don\'t care abaht my\r\nrheumatics, do yer?\'\r\n\r\nAt last she finished, and Liza went to bed by her mother\'s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days passed, and it was Friday morning. Liza had got up early and\r\nstrolled off to her work in good time, but she did not meet her\r\nfaithful Sally on the way, nor find her at the factory when she\r\nherself arrived. The bell rang and all the girls trooped in, but still\r\nSally did not come. Liza could not make it out, and was thinking she\r\nwould be shut out, when just as the man who gave out the tokens for\r\nthe day\'s work was pulling down the shutter in front of his window,\r\nSally arrived, breathless and perspiring.\r\n\r\n\'Whew! Go\' lumme, I am \'ot!\' she said, wiping her face with her apron.\r\n\r\n\'I thought you wasn\'t comin\',\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I only just did it; I overslep\' myself. I was aht lite last\r\nnight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Were yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me an\' \'Arry went ter see the ply. Oh, Liza, it\'s simply spiffin\'!\r\nI\'ve never see sich a good ply in my life. Lor\'! Why, it mikes yer\r\nblood run cold: they \'ang a man on the stige; oh, it mide me creep all\r\nover!\'\r\n\r\nAnd then she began telling Liza all about it--the blood and thunder,\r\nthe shooting, the railway train, the murder, the bomb, the hero, the\r\nfunny man--jumbling everything up in her excitement, repeating little\r\nscraps of dialogue--all wrong--gesticulating, getting excited and red\r\nin the face at the recollection. Liza listened rather crossly, feeling\r\nbored at the detail into which Sally was going: the piece really\r\ndidn\'t much interest her.\r\n\r\n\'One \'ud think yer\'d never been to a theatre in your life before,\' she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\'I never seen anything so good, I can tell yer. You tike my tip, and\r\ngit Tom ter tike yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want ter go; an\' if I did I\'d py for myself an\' go alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cheese it! That ain\'t \'alf so good. Me an\' \'Arry, we set together,\r\n\'im with \'is arm round my wiste and me oldin\' \'is \'and. It was jam, I\r\ncan tell yer!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t want anyone sprawlin\' me abaht, thet ain\'t my mark!\'\r\n\r\n\'But I do like \'Arry; you dunno the little ways \'e \'as; an\' we\'re\r\ngoin\' ter be married in three weeks now. \'Arry said, well, \'e says,\r\n"I\'ll git a licence." "Na," says I, "\'ave the banns read aht in\r\nchurch: it seems more reg\'lar like to \'ave banns; so they\'re goin\' ter\r\nbe read aht next Sunday. You\'ll come with me \'an \'ear them, won\'t yer,\r\nLiza?"\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I don\'t mind.\'\r\n\r\nOn the way home Sally insisted on stopping in front of the poster and\r\nexplaining to Liza all about the scene represented.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you give me the sick with your "Fital Card", you do! I\'m goin\'\r\n\'ome.\' And she left Sally in the midst of her explanation.\r\n\r\n\'I dunno wot\'s up with Liza,\' remarked Sally to a mutual friend.\r\n\'She\'s always got the needle, some\'ow.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, she\'s barmy,\' answered the friend.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I do think she\'s a bit dotty sometimes--I do really,\' rejoined\r\nSally.\r\n\r\nLiza walked homewards, thinking of the play; at length she tossed her\r\nhead impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want ter see the blasted thing; an\' if I see that there Jim\r\nI\'ll tell \'im so; swop me bob, I will.\'\r\n\r\nShe did see him; he was leaning with his back against the wall of his\r\nhouse, smoking. Liza knew he had seen her, and as she walked by\r\npretended not to have noticed him. To her disgust, he let her pass,\r\nand she was thinking he hadn\'t seen her after all, when she heard him\r\ncall her name.\r\n\r\n\'Liza!\'\r\n\r\nShe turned round and started with surprise very well imitated. \'I\r\ndidn\'t see you was there!\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Why did yer pretend not ter notice me, as yer went past--eh, Liza?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I didn\'t see yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! But you ain\'t shirty with me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot \'ave I got to be shirty abaht?\'\r\n\r\nHe tried to take her hand, but she drew it away quickly. She was\r\ngetting used to the movement. They went on talking, but Jim did not\r\nmention the theatre; Liza was surprised, and wondered whether he had\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n\'Er--Sally went to the ply last night,\' she said, at last.\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' he said, and that was all.\r\n\r\nShe got impatient.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m off!\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Na, don\'t go yet; I want ter talk ter yer,\' he replied.\r\n\r\n\'Wot abaht? anythin\' in partickler?\' She would drag it out of him if\r\nshe possibly could.\r\n\r\n\'Not thet I knows on,\' he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\'Good night!\' she said, abruptly, turning away from him.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m damned if \'e ain\'t forgotten!\' she said to herself,\r\nsulkily, as she marched home.\r\n\r\nThe following evening about six o\'clock, it suddenly struck her that\r\nit was the last night of the \'New and Sensational Drama\'.\r\n\r\n\'I do like thet Jim Blakeston,\' she said to herself; \'fancy treatin\'\r\nme like thet! You wouldn\'t catch Tom doin\' sich a thing. Bli\'me if I\r\nspeak to \'im again, the ----. Now I shan\'t see it at all. I\'ve a good\r\nmind ter go on my own \'ook. Fancy \'is forgettin\' all abaht it, like\r\nthet!\'\r\n\r\nShe was really quite indignant; though, as she had distinctly refused\r\nJim\'s offer, it was rather hard to see why.\r\n\r\n\'\'E said \'e\'d wite for me ahtside the doors; I wonder if \'e\'s there.\r\nI\'ll go an\' see if \'e is, see if I don\'t--an\' then if \'e\'s there, I\'ll\r\ngo in on my own \'ook, jist ter spite \'im!\'\r\n\r\nShe dressed herself in her best, and, so that the neighbours shouldn\'t\r\nsee her, went up a passage between some model lodging-house buildings,\r\nand in this roundabout way got into the Westminster Bridge Road, and\r\nsoon found herself in front of the theatre.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been witin\' for yer this \'alf-hour.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned round and saw Jim standing just behind her.\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo are you talkin\' to? I\'m not goin\' to the ply with you. Wot d\'yer\r\ntike me for, eh?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo are yer goin\' with, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m goin\' alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! don\'t be a bloomin\' jackass!\'\r\n\r\nLiza was feeling very injured.\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s \'ow you treat me! I shall go \'ome. Why didn\'t you come aht the\r\nother night?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer told me not ter.\'\r\n\r\nShe snorted at the ridiculous ineptitude of the reply.\r\n\r\n\'Why didn\'t you say nothin\' abaht it yesterday?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I thought you\'d come if I didn\'t talk on it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I think you\'re a ---- brute!\' She felt very much inclined to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\'Come on, Liza, don\'t tike on; I didn\'t mean no offence.\' And he put\r\nhis arm round her waist and led her to take their places at the\r\ngallery door. Two tears escaped from the corners of her eyes and ran\r\ndown her nose, but she felt very relieved and happy, and let him lead\r\nher where he would.\r\n\r\nThere was a long string of people waiting at the door, and Liza was\r\ndelighted to see a couple of niggers who were helping them to while\r\naway the time of waiting. The niggers sang and danced, and made faces,\r\nwhile the people looked on with appreciative gravity, like royalty\r\nlistening to de Resk\xe9, and they were very generous of applause and\r\nhalfpence at the end of the performance. Then, when the niggers moved\r\nto the pit doors, paper boys came along offering _Tit-Bits_ and \'extra\r\nspecials\'; after that three little girls came round and sang\r\nsentimental songs and collected more halfpence. At last a movement ran\r\nthrough the serpent-like string of people, sounds were heard behind\r\nthe door, everyone closed up, the men told the women to keep close and\r\nhold tight; there was a great unbarring and unbolting, the doors were\r\nthrown open, and, like a bursting river, the people surged in.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour more and the curtain went up. The play was indeed\r\nthrilling. Liza quite forgot her companion, and was intent on the\r\nscene; she watched the incidents breathlessly, trembling with\r\nexcitement, almost beside herself at the celebrated hanging incident.\r\nWhen the curtain fell on the first act she sighed and mopped her face.\r\n\r\n\'See \'ow \'ot I am.\' she said to Jim, giving him her hand.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, you are!\' he remarked, taking it.\r\n\r\n\'Leave go!\' she said, trying to withdraw it from him.\r\n\r\n\'Not much,\' he answered, quite boldly.\r\n\r\n\'Garn! Leave go!\' But he didn\'t, and she really did not struggle very\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nThe second act came, and she shrieked over the comic man; and her\r\nlaughter rang higher than anyone else\'s, so that people turned to look\r\nat her, and said:\r\n\r\n\'She is enjoyin\' \'erself.\'\r\n\r\nThen when the murder came she bit her nails and the sweat stood on her\r\nforehead in great drops; in her excitement she even called out as loud\r\nas she could to the victim, \'Look aht!\' It caused a laugh and\r\nslackened the tension, for the whole house was holding its breath as\r\nit looked at the villains listening at the door, creeping silently\r\nforward, crawling like tigers to their prey.\r\n\r\nLiza trembling all over, and in her terror threw herself against Jim,\r\nwho put both his arms round her, and said:\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be afride, Liza; it\'s all right.\'\r\n\r\nAt last the men sprang, there was a scuffle, and the wretch was\r\nkilled, then came the scene depicted on the posters--the victim\'s son\r\nknocking at the door, on the inside of which were the murderers and\r\nthe murdered man. At last the curtain came down, and the house in\r\nrelief burst forth into cheers and cheers; the handsome hero in his\r\ntop hat was greeted thunderously; the murdered man, with his clothes\r\nstill all disarranged, was hailed with sympathy; and the villains--the\r\nhouse yelled and hissed and booed, while the poor brutes bowed and\r\ntried to look as if they liked it.\r\n\r\n\'I am enjoyin\' myself,\' said Liza, pressing herself quite close to\r\nJim; \'you are a good sort ter tike me--Jim.\'\r\n\r\nHe gave her a little hug, and it struck her that she was sitting just\r\nas Sally had done, and, like Sally, she found it \'jam\'.\r\n\r\nThe _entr\'actes_ were short and the curtain was soon up again, and the\r\ncomic man raised customary laughter by undressing and exposing his\r\nnether garments to the public view; then more tragedy, and the final\r\nact with its darkened room, its casting lots, and its explosion.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over and they had got outside Jim smacked his lips and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\'I could do with a gargle; let\'s go onto thet pub there.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m as dry as bone,\' said Liza; and so they went.\r\n\r\nWhen they got in they discovered they were hungry, and seeing some\r\nappetising sausage-rolls, ate of them, and washed them down with a\r\ncouple of pots of beer; then Jim lit his pipe and they strolled off.\r\nThey had got quite near the Westminster Bridge Road when Jim suggested\r\nthat they should go and have one more drink before closing time.\r\n\r\n\'I shall be tight,\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Thet don\'t matter,\' answered Jim, laughing. \'You ain\'t got ter go ter\r\nwork in the mornin\' an\' you can sleep it aht.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, I don\'t mind if I do then, in for a penny, in for a pound.\'\r\n\r\nAt the pub door she drew back.\r\n\r\n\'I say, guv\'ner,\' she said, \'there\'ll be some of the coves from dahn\r\nour street, and they\'ll see us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, there won\'t be nobody there, don\'t yer \'ave no fear.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like ter go in for fear of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we ain\'t doin\' no \'arm if they does see us, an\' we can go into\r\nthe private bar, an\' you bet your boots there won\'t be no one there.\'\r\n\r\nShe yielded, and they went in.\r\n\r\n\'Two pints of bitter, please, miss,\' ordered Jim.\r\n\r\n\'I say, \'old \'ard. I can\'t drink more than \'alf a pint,\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Cheese it,\' answered Jim. \'You can do with all you can get, I know.\'\r\n\r\nAt closing time they left and walked down the broad road which led\r\nhomewards.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s \'ave a little sit dahn,\' said Jim, pointing to an empty bench\r\nbetween two trees.\r\n\r\n\'Na, it\'s gettin\' lite; I want ter be \'ome.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s such a fine night, it\'s a pity ter go in already;\' and he drew\r\nher unresisting towards the seat. He put his arm round her waist.\r\n\r\n\'Un\'and me, villin!\' she said, in apt misquotation of the melodrama,\r\nbut Jim only laughed, and she made no effort to disengage herself.\r\n\r\nThey sat there for a long while in silence; the beer had got to Liza\'s\r\nhead, and the warm night air filled her with a double intoxication.\r\nShe felt the arm round her waist, and the big, heavy form pressing\r\nagainst her side; she experienced again the curious sensation as if\r\nher heart were about to burst, and it choked her--a feeling so\r\noppressive and painful it almost made her feel sick. Her hands began\r\nto tremble, and her breathing grew rapid, as though she were\r\nsuffocating. Almost fainting, she swayed over towards the man, and a\r\ncold shiver ran through her from top to toe. Jim bent over her, and,\r\ntaking her in both arms, he pressed his lips to hers in a long,\r\npassionate kiss. At last, panting for breath, she turned her head away\r\nand groaned.\r\n\r\nThen they again sat for a long while in silence, Liza full of a\r\nstrange happiness, feeling as if she could laugh aloud hysterically,\r\nbut restrained by the calm and silence of the night. Close behind\r\nstruck a church clock--one.\r\n\r\n\'Bless my soul!\' said Liza, starting, \'there\'s one o\'clock. I must get\r\n\'ome.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s so nice out \'ere; do sty, Liza.\' He pressed her closer to him.\r\n\'Yer know, Liza, I love yer--fit ter kill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I can\'t stay; come on.\' She got up from the seat, and pulled him\r\nup too. \'Come on,\' she said.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking they went along, and there was no one to be seen\r\neither in front or behind them. He had not got his arm round her now,\r\nand they were walking side by side, slightly separated. It was Liza\r\nwho spoke first.\r\n\r\n\'You\'d better go dahn the Road and by the church an\' git into Vere\r\nStreet the other end, an\' I\'ll go through the passage, so thet no one\r\nshouldn\'t see us comin\' together,\' she spoke almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\'Arright, Liza,\' he answered, \'I\'ll do just as you tell me.\'\r\n\r\nThey came to the passage of which Liza spoke; it was a narrow way\r\nbetween blank walls, the backs of factories, and it led into the upper\r\nend of Vere Street. The entrance to it was guarded by two iron posts\r\nin the middle so that horses or barrows should not be taken through.\r\n\r\nThey had just got to it when a man came out into the open road. Liza\r\nquickly turned her head away.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if \'e see us,\' she said, when he had passed out of earshot.\r\n\'\'E\'s lookin\' back,\' she added.\r\n\r\n\'Why, \'oo is it?\' asked Jim.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a man aht of our street,\' she answered. \'I dunno \'im, but I know\r\nwhere \'e lodges. D\'yer think \'e sees us?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, \'e wouldn\'t know \'oo it was in the dark.\'\r\n\r\n\'But he looked round; all the street\'ll know it if he see us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, we ain\'t doin\' no \'arm.\'\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand to say good night.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll come a wy with yer along the passage,\' said Jim.\r\n\r\n\'Na, you mustn\'t; you go straight round.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s so dark; p\'raps summat\'ll \'appen to yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not it! You go on \'ome an\' leave me,\' she replied, and entering the\r\npassage, stood facing him with one of the iron pillars between them.\r\n\r\n\'Good night, old cock,\' she said, stretching out her hand. He took it,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\'I wish yer wasn\'t goin\' ter leave me, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! I must!\' She tried to get her hand away from his, but he held\r\nit firm, resting it on the top of the pillar.\r\n\r\n\'Leave go my \'and,\' she said. He made no movement, but looked into her\r\neyes steadily, so that it made her uneasy. She repented having come\r\nout with him. \'Leave go my \'and.\' And she beat down on his with her\r\nclosed fist.\r\n\r\n\'Liza!\' he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\'Well, wot is it?\' she answered, still thumping down on his hand with\r\nher fist.\r\n\r\n\'Liza,\' he said a whisper, \'will yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Will I wot?\' she said, looking down.\r\n\r\n\'You know, Liza. Sy, will yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' she said.\r\n\r\nHe bent over her and repeated--\r\n\r\n\'Will yer?\'\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, but kept beating down on his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Liza,\' he said again, his voice growing hoarse and thick--\'Liza, will\r\nyer?\'\r\n\r\nShe still kept silence, looking away and continually bringing down her\r\nfist. He looked at her a moment, and she, ceasing to thump his hand,\r\nlooked up at him with half-opened mouth. Suddenly he shook himself,\r\nand closing his fist gave her a violent, swinging blow in the belly.\r\n\r\n\'Come on.\' he said.\r\n\r\nAnd together they slid down into the darkness of the passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp was in the habit of slumbering somewhat heavily on Sunday\r\nmornings, or Liza would not have been allowed to go on sleeping as she\r\ndid. When she woke, she rubbed her eyes to gather her senses together\r\nand gradually she remembered having gone to the theatre on the\r\nprevious evening; then suddenly everything came back to her. She\r\nstretched out her legs and gave a long sigh of delight. Her heart was\r\nfull; she thought of Jim, and the delicious sensation of love came\r\nover her. Closing her eyes, she imagined his warm kisses, and she\r\nlifted up her arms as if to put them round his neck and draw him down\r\nto her; she almost felt the rough beard on her face, and the strong\r\nheavy arms round her body. She smiled to herself and took a long\r\nbreath; then, slipping back the sleeves of her nightdress, she looked\r\nat her own thin arms, just two pieces of bone with not a muscle on\r\nthem, but very white and showing distinctly the interlacement of blue\r\nveins: she did not notice that her hands were rough, and red and dirty\r\nwith the nails broken, and bitten to the quick. She got out of bed and\r\nlooked at herself in the glass over the mantelpiece: with one hand she\r\nbrushed back her hair and smiled at herself; her face was very small\r\nand thin, but the complexion was nice, clear and white, with a\r\ndelicate tint of red on the cheeks, and her eyes were big and dark\r\nlike her hair. She felt very happy.\r\n\r\nShe did not want to dress yet, but rather to sit down and think, so\r\nshe twisted up her hair into a little knot, slipped a skirt over her\r\nnightdress, and sat on a chair near the window and began looking\r\naround. The decorations of the room had been centred on the\r\nmantelpiece; the chief ornament consisted of a pear and an apple, a\r\npineapple, a bunch of grapes, and several fat plums, all very\r\nbeautifully done in wax, as was the fashion about the middle of this\r\nmost glorious reign. They were appropriately coloured--the apple\r\nblushing red, the grapes an inky black, emerald green leaves were\r\nscattered here and there to lend finish, and the whole was mounted on\r\nan ebonised stand covered with black velvet, and protected from dust\r\nand dirt by a beautiful glass cover bordered with red plush. Liza\'s\r\neyes rested on this with approbation, and the pineapple quite made her\r\nmouth water. At either end of the mantelpiece were pink jars with blue\r\nflowers on the front; round the top in Gothic letters of gold was\r\ninscribed: \'A Present from a Friend\'--these were products of a later,\r\nbut not less artistic age. The intervening spaces were taken up with\r\nlittle jars and cups and saucers--gold inside, with a view of a town\r\noutside, and surrounding them, \'A Present from Clacton-on-Sea,\' or,\r\nalliteratively, \'A Memento of Margate.\' Of these many were broken, but\r\nthey had been mended with glue, and it is well known that pottery in\r\nthe eyes of the connoisseur loses none of its value by a crack or two.\r\nThen there were portraits innumerable--little yellow cartes-de-visite\r\nin velvet frames, some of which were decorated with shells; they\r\nshowed strange people with old-fashioned clothes, the women with\r\nbodices and sleeves fitting close to the figure, stern-featured\r\nfemales with hair carefully parted in the middle and plastered down on\r\neach side, firm chins and mouths, with small, pig-like eyes and\r\nwrinkled faces, and the men were uncomfortably clad in Sunday\r\ngarments, very stiff and uneasy in their awkward postures, with large\r\nwhiskers and shaved chins and upper lips and a general air of\r\nhorny-handed toil. Then there were one or two daguerreotypes, little\r\nfull-length figures framed in gold paper. There was one of Mrs. Kemp\'s\r\nfather and one of her mother, and there were several photographs of\r\nbetrothed or newly-married couples, the lady sitting down and the man\r\nstanding behind her with his hand on the chair, or the man sitting and\r\nthe woman with her hand on his shoulder. And from all sides of the\r\nroom, standing on the mantelpiece, hanging above it, on the wall and\r\nover the bed, they stared full-face into the room, self-consciously\r\nfixed for ever in their stiff discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe walls were covered with dingy, antiquated paper, and ornamented\r\nwith coloured supplements from Christmas Numbers--there was a very\r\npatriotic picture of a soldier shaking the hand of a fallen comrade\r\nand waving his arm in defiance of a band of advancing Arabs; there was\r\na \'Cherry Ripe,\' almost black with age and dirt; there were two\r\nalmanacks several years old, one with a coloured portrait of the\r\nMarquess of Lorne, very handsome and elegantly dressed, the object of\r\nMrs. Kemp\'s adoration since her husband\'s demise; the other a Jubilee\r\nportrait of the Queen, somewhat losing in dignity by a moustache which\r\nLiza in an irreverent moment had smeared on with charcoal.\r\n\r\nThe furniture consisted of a wash-hand stand and a little deal chest\r\nof drawers, which acted as sideboard to such pots and pans and\r\ncrockery as could not find room in the grate; and besides the bed\r\nthere was nothing but two kitchen chairs and a lamp. Liza looked at it\r\nall and felt perfectly satisfied; she put a pin into one corner of the\r\nnoble Marquess to prevent him from falling, fiddled about with the\r\nornaments a little, and then started washing herself. After putting on\r\nher clothes she ate some bread-and-butter, swallowed a dishful of cold\r\ntea, and went out into the street.\r\n\r\nShe saw some boys playing cricket and went up to them.\r\n\r\n\'Let me ply,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Arright, Liza,\' cried half a dozen of them in delight; and the\r\ncaptain added: \'You go an\' scout over by the lamp-post.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go an\' scout my eye!\' said Liza, indignantly. \'When I ply cricket I\r\ndoes the battin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, you\'re not goin\' ter bat all the time. \'Oo are you gettin\' at?\'\r\nreplied the captain, who had taken advantage of his position to put\r\nhimself in first, and was still at the wicket.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then I shan\'t ply,\' answered Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Garn, Ernie, let \'er go in!\' shouted two or three members of the\r\nteam.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m busted!\' remarked the captain, as she took his bat. \'You\r\nwon\'t sty in long, I lay,\' he said, as he sent the old bowler fielding\r\nand took the ball himself. He was a young gentleman who did not suffer\r\nfrom excessive backwardness.\r\n\r\n\'Aht!\' shouted a dozen voices as the ball went past Liza\'s bat and\r\nlanded in the pile of coats which formed the wicket. The captain came\r\nforward to resume his innings, but Liza held the bat away from him.\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' she said; \'thet was only a trial.\'\r\n\r\n\'You never said trial,\' answered the captain indignantly.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I did,\' said Liza; \'I said it just as the ball was comin\'--under\r\nmy breath.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am busted!\' repeated the captain.\r\n\r\nJust then Liza saw Tom among the lookers-on, and as she felt very\r\nkindly disposed to the world in general that morning, she called out\r\nto him:\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa, Tom!\' she said. \'Come an\' give us a ball; this chap can\'t\r\nbowl.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I got yer aht, any\'ow,\' said that person.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, yer wouldn\'t \'ave got me aht plyin\' square. But a trial\r\nball--well, one don\'t ever know wot a trial ball\'s goin\' ter do.\'\r\n\r\nTom began bowling very slowly and easily, so that Liza could swing her\r\nbat round and hit mightily; she ran well, too, and pantingly brought\r\nup her score to twenty. Then the fielders interposed.\r\n\r\n\'I sy, look \'ere, \'e\'s only givin\' \'er lobs; \'e\'s not tryin\' ter git\r\n\'er aht.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re spoilin\' our gime.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t care; I\'ve got twenty runs--thet\'s more than you could do.\r\nI\'ll go aht now of my own accord, so there! Come on, Tom.\'\r\n\r\nTom joined her, and as the captain at last resumed his bat and the\r\ngame went on, they commenced talking, Liza leaning against the wall of\r\na house, while Tom stood in front of her, smiling with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\'Where \'ave you been idin\' yerself, Tom? I ain\'t seen yer for I dunno\r\n\'ow long.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been abaht as usual; an\' I\'ve seen you when you didn\'t see me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, yer might \'ave come up and said good mornin\' when you see me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t want ter force myself on, yer, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! You are a bloomin\' cuckoo. I\'m blowed!\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought yer didn\'t like me \'angin\' round yer; so I kep\' awy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, yer talks as if I didn\'t like yer. Yer don\'t think I\'d \'ave come\r\naht beanfeastin\' with yer if I \'adn\'t liked yer?\'\r\n\r\nLiza was really very dishonest, but she felt so happy this morning\r\nthat she loved the whole world, and of course Tom came in with the\r\nothers. She looked very kindly at him, and he was so affected that a\r\ngreat lump came in his throat and he could not speak.\r\n\r\nLiza\'s eyes turned to Jim\'s house, and she saw coming out of the door\r\na girl of about her own age; she fancied she saw in her some likeness\r\nto Jim.\r\n\r\n\'Say, Tom,\' she asked, \'thet ain\'t Blakeston\'s daughter, is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus thet\'s it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll go an\' speak to \'er,\' said Liza, leaving Tom and going over the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re Polly Blakeston, ain\'t yer?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s me!\' said the girl.\r\n\r\n\'I thought you was. Your dad, \'e says ter me, "You dunno my daughter,\r\nPolly, do yer?" says \'e. "Na," says I, "I don\'t." "Well," says \'e,\r\n"You can\'t miss \'er when you see \'er." An\' right enough I didn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother says I\'m all father, an\' there ain\'t nothin\' of \'er in me. Dad\r\nsays it\'s lucky it ain\'t the other wy abaht, or e\'d \'ave got a\r\ndivorce.\'\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Where are you goin\' now?\' asked Liza, looking at the slop-basin she\r\nwas carrying.\r\n\r\n\'I was just goin\' dahn into the road ter get some ice-cream for\r\ndinner. Father \'ad a bit of luck last night, \'e says, and \'e\'d stand\r\nthe lot of us ice-cream for dinner ter-day.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll come with yer if yer like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come on!\' And, already friends, they walked arm-in-arm to the\r\nWestminster Bridge Road. Then they went along till they came to a\r\nstall where an Italian was selling the required commodity, and having\r\nhad a taste apiece to see if they liked it, Polly planked down\r\nsixpence and had her basin filled with a poisonous-looking mixture of\r\nred and white ice-cream.\r\n\r\nOn the way back, looking up the street, Polly cried:\r\n\r\n\'There\'s father!\'\r\n\r\nLiza\'s heart beat rapidly and she turned red; but suddenly a sense of\r\nshame came over her, and casting down her head so that she might not\r\nsee him, she said:\r\n\r\n\'I think I\'ll be off \'ome an\' see \'ow mother\'s gettin\' on.\' And before\r\nPolly could say anything she had slipped away and entered her own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMother was not getting on at all well.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve come in at last, you ----, you!\' snarled Mrs. Kemp, as Liza\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the matter, mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Matter! I like thet--matter indeed! Go an\' matter yerself an\' be\r\nmattered! Nice way ter treat an old woman like me--an\' yer own mother,\r\ntoo!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s up now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t talk ter me; I don\'t want ter listen ter you. Leavin\' me all\r\nalone, me with my rheumatics, an\' the neuralgy! I\'ve \'ad the neuralgy\r\nall the mornin\', and my \'ead\'s been simply splittin\', so thet I\r\nthought the bones \'ud come apart and all my brains go streamin\' on the\r\nfloor. An\' when I wake up there\'s no one ter git my tea for me, an\' I\r\nlay there witin\' an\' witin\', an\' at last I \'ad ter git up and mike it\r\nmyself. And, my \'ead simply cruel! Why, I might \'ave been burnt ter\r\ndeath with the fire alight an\' me asleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am sorry, mother; but I went aht just for a bit, an\' didn\'t\r\nthink you\'d wike. An\' besides, the fire wasn\'t alight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn with yer! I didn\'t treat my mother like thet. Oh, you\'ve been a\r\nbad daughter ter me--an\' I \'ad more illness carryin\' you than with all\r\nthe other children put togither. You was a cross at yer birth, an\'\r\nyou\'ve been a cross ever since. An\' now in my old age, when I\'ve\r\nworked myself ter the bone, yer leaves me to starve and burn to\r\ndeath.\' Here she began to cry, and the rest of her utterances was lost\r\nin sobs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dusk had darkened into night, and Mrs. Kemp had retired to rest\r\nwith the dicky-birds. Liza was thinking of many things; she wondered\r\nwhy she had been unwilling to meet Jim in the morning.\r\n\r\n\'I was a bally fool,\' she said to herself.\r\n\r\nIt really seemed an age since the previous night, and all that had\r\nhappened seemed very long ago. She had not spoken to Jim all day, and\r\nshe had so much to say to him. Then, wondering whether he was about,\r\nshe went to the window and looked out; but there was nobody there. She\r\nclosed the window again and sat just beside it; the time went on, and\r\nshe wondered whether he would come, asking herself whether he had been\r\nthinking of her as she of him; gradually her thoughts grew vague, and\r\na kind of mist came over them. She nodded. Suddenly she roused\r\nherself with a start, fancying she had heard something; she listened\r\nagain, and in a moment the sound was repeated, three or four gentle\r\ntaps on the window. She opened it quickly and whispered:\r\n\r\n\'Jim.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s me,\' he answered, \'come aht.\'\r\n\r\nClosing the window, she went into the passage and opened the street\r\ndoor; it was hardly unlocked before Jim had pushed his way in; partly\r\nshutting it behind him, he took her in his arms and hugged her to his\r\nbreast. She kissed him passionately.\r\n\r\n\'I thought yer\'d come ter-night, Jim; summat in my \'eart told me so.\r\nBut you \'ave been long.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t come before, \'cause I thought there\'d be people abaht.\r\nKiss us!\' And again he pressed his lips to hers, and Liza nearly\r\nfainted with the delight of it.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go for a walk, shall we?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Arright!\' They were speaking in whispers. \'You go into the road\r\nthrough the passage, an\' I\'ll go by the street.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, thet\'s right,\' and kissing her once more, he slid out, and she\r\nclosed the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThen going back to get her hat, she came again into the passage,\r\nwaiting behind the door till it might be safe for her to venture. She\r\nhad not made up her mind to risk it, when she heard a key put in the\r\nlock, and she hardly had time to spring back to prevent herself from\r\nbeing hit by the opening door. It was a man, one of the upstairs\r\nlodgers.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa!\' he said, \'\'oo\'s there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. \'Odges! Strikes me, you did give me a turn; I was just goin\' aht.\'\r\nShe blushed to her hair, but in the darkness he could see nothing.\r\n\r\n\'Good night,\' she said, and went out.\r\n\r\nShe walked close along the sides of the houses like a thief, and the\r\npoliceman as she passed him turned round and looked at her, wondering\r\nwhether she was meditating some illegal deed. She breathed freely on\r\ncoming into the open road, and seeing Jim skulking behind a tree, ran\r\nup to him, and in the shadows they kissed again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\nThus began a time of love and joy. As soon as her work was over and\r\nshe had finished tea, Liza would slip out and at some appointed spot\r\nmeet Jim. Usually it would be at the church, where the Westminster\r\nBridge Road bends down to get to the river, and they would go off,\r\narm-in-arm, till they came to some place where they could sit down and\r\nrest. Sometimes they would walk along the Albert Embankment to\r\nBattersea Park, and here sit on the benches, watching the children\r\nplay. The female cyclist had almost abandoned Battersea for the parks\r\non the other side of the river, but often enough one went by, and\r\nLiza, with the old-fashioned prejudice of her class, would look after\r\nthe rider and make some remark about her, not seldom more forcible\r\nthan ladylike. Both Jim and she liked children, and, tiny, ragged\r\nurchins would gather round to have rides on the man\'s knees or mock\r\nfights with Liza.\r\n\r\nThey thought themselves far away from anyone in Vere Street, but\r\ntwice, as they were walking along, they were met by people they knew.\r\nOnce it was two workmen coming home from a job at Vauxhall: Liza did\r\nnot see them till they were quite near; she immediately dropped Jim\'s\r\narm, and they both cast their eyes to the ground as the men passed,\r\nlike ostriches, expecting that if they did not look they would not be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\'D\'you see \'em, Jim?\' asked Liza, in a whisper, when they had gone by.\r\n\'I wonder if they see us.\' Almost instinctively she turned round, and\r\nat the same moment one of the men turned too; then there was no doubt\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\'Thet did give me a turn,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'So it did me,\' answered Jim; \'I simply went \'ot all over.\'\r\n\r\n\'We was bally fools,\' said Liza; \'we oughter \'ave spoken to \'em! D\'you\r\nthink they\'ll let aht?\'\r\n\r\nThey heard nothing of it, when Jim afterwards met one of the men in a\r\npublic-house he did not mention a meeting, and they thought that\r\nperhaps they had not been recognized. But the second time was worse.\r\n\r\nIt was on the Albert Embankment again. They were met by a party of\r\nfour, all of whom lived in the street. Liza\'s heart sank within her,\r\nfor there was no chance of escape; she thought of turning quickly and\r\nwalking in the opposite direction, but there was not time, for the men\r\nhad already seen them. She whispered to Jim:\r\n\r\n\'Back us up,\' and as they met she said to one of the men:\r\n\r\n\'\'Ulloa there! Where are you off to?\'\r\n\r\nThe men stopped, and one of them asked the question back.\r\n\r\n\'Where are you off to?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me? Oh, I\'ve just been to the \'orspital. One of the gals at our place\r\nis queer, an\' so I says ter myself, "I\'ll go an\' see \'er."\' She\r\nfaltered a little as she began, but quickly gathered herself together,\r\nlying fluently and without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\'An\' when I come aht,\' she went on, \'\'oo should I see just passin\' the\r\n\'orspital but this \'ere cove, an\' \'e says to me, "Wot cheer," says \'e,\r\n"I\'m goin\' ter Vaux\'all, come an\' walk a bit of the wy with us."\r\n"Arright," says I, "I don\'t mind if I do."\'\r\n\r\nOne man winked, and another said: \'Go it, Liza!\'\r\n\r\nShe fired up with the dignity of outraged innocence.\r\n\r\n\'Wot d\'yer mean by thet?\' she said; \'d\'yer think I\'m kiddin\'?\'\r\n\r\n\'Kiddin\'? No! You\'ve only just come up from the country, ain\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Think I\'m kidding? What d\'yer think I want ter kid for? Liars never\r\nbelieve anyone, thet\'s fact.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na then, Liza, don\'t be saucy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Saucy! I\'ll smack yer in the eye if yer sy much ter me. Come on,\' she\r\nsaid to Jim, who had been standing sheepishly by; and they walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe men shouted: \'Now we shan\'t be long!\' and went off laughing.\r\n\r\nAfter that they decided to go where there was no chance at all of\r\ntheir being seen. They did not meet till they got over Westminster\r\nBridge, and thence they made their way into the park; they would lie\r\ndown on the grass in one another\'s arms, and thus spend the long\r\nsummer evenings. After the heat of the day there would be a gentle\r\nbreeze in the park, and they would take in long breaths of the air; it\r\nseemed far away from London, it was so quiet and cool; and Liza, as\r\nshe lay by Jim\'s side, felt her love for him overflowing to the rest\r\nof the world and enveloping mankind itself in a kind of grateful\r\nhappiness. If it could only have lasted! They would stay and see the\r\nstars shine out dimly, one by one, from the blue sky, till it grew\r\nlate and the blue darkened into black, and the stars glittered in\r\nthousands all above them. But as the nights grew cooler, they found it\r\ncold on the grass, and the time they had there seemed too short for\r\nthe long journey they had to make; so, crossing the bridge as before,\r\nthey strolled along the Embankment till they came to a vacant bench,\r\nand there they would sit, with Liza nestling close up to her lover and\r\nhis great arms around her. The rain of September made no difference to\r\nthem; they went as usual to their seat beneath the trees, and Jim\r\nwould take Liza on his knee, and, opening his coat, shelter her with\r\nit, while she, with her arms round his neck, pressed very close to\r\nhim, and occasionally gave a little laugh of pleasure and delight.\r\nThey hardly spoke at all through these evenings, for what had they to\r\nsay to one another? Often without exchanging a word they would sit for\r\nan hour with their faces touching, the one feeling on his cheek the\r\nhot breath from the other\'s mouth; while at the end of the time the\r\nonly motion was an upraising of Liza\'s lips, a bending down of Jim\'s,\r\nso that they might meet and kiss. Sometimes Liza fell into a light\r\ndoze, and Jim would sit very still for fear of waking her, and when\r\nshe roused herself she would smile, while he bent down again and\r\nkissed her. They were very happy. But the hours passed by so quickly,\r\nthat Big Ben striking twelve came upon them as a surprise, and\r\nunwillingly they got up and made their way homewards; their partings\r\nwere never ending--each evening Jim refused to let her go from his\r\narms, and tears stood in his eyes at the thought of the separation.\r\n\r\n\'I\'d give somethin\',\' he would say, \'if we could be togither always.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, old chap!\' Liza would answer, herself half crying, \'it\r\ncan\'t be \'elped, so we must jolly well lump it.\'\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all their precautions people in Vere Street\r\nappeared to know. First of all Liza noticed that the women did not\r\nseem quite so cordial as before, and she often fancied they were\r\ntalking of her; when she passed by they appeared to look at her, then\r\nsay something or other, and perhaps burst out laughing; but when she\r\napproached they would immediately stop speaking, and keep silence in a\r\nrather awkward, constrained manner. For a long time she was unwilling\r\nto believe that there was any change in them, and Jim who had observed\r\nnothing, persuaded her that it was all fancy. But gradually it became\r\nclearer, and Jim had to agree with her that somehow or other people\r\nhad found out. Once when Liza had been talking to Polly, Jim\'s\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Blakeston had called her, and when the girl had come to\r\nher mother Liza saw that she spoke angrily, and they both looked\r\nacross at her. When Liza caught Mrs. Blakeston\'s eye she saw in her\r\nface a surly scowl, which almost frightened her; she wanted to brave\r\nit out, and stepped forward a little to go and speak with the woman,\r\nbut Mrs. Blakeston, standing still, looked so angrily at her that she\r\nwas afraid to. When she told Jim his face grew dark, and he said:\r\n\'Blast the woman! I\'ll give \'er wot for if she says anythin\' ter you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t strike \'er, wotever \'appens, will yer, Jim?\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'She\'d better tike care then!\' he answered, and he told her that\r\nlately his wife had been sulking, and not speaking to him. The\r\nprevious night, on coming home after the day\'s work and bidding her\r\n\'Good evenin\',\' she had turned her back on him without answering.\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t you answer when you\'re spoke to?\' he had said.\r\n\r\n\'Good evenin\',\' she had replied sulkily, with her back still turned.\r\n\r\nAfter that Liza noticed that Polly avoided her.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s up, Polly?\' she said to her one day. \'You never speaks now;\r\n\'ave you \'ad yer tongue cut aht?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me? I ain\'t got nothin\' ter speak abaht, thet I knows of,\' answered\r\nPolly, abruptly walking off. Liza grew very red and quickly looked to\r\nsee if anyone had noticed the incident. A couple of youths, sitting on\r\nthe pavement, had seen it, and she saw them nudge one another and\r\nwink.\r\n\r\nThen the fellows about the street began to chaff her.\r\n\r\n\'You look pale,\' said one of a group to her one day.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re overworkin\' yerself, you are,\' said another.\r\n\r\n\'Married life don\'t agree with Liza, thet\'s wot it is,\' added a third.\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo d\'yer think yer gettin\' at? I ain\'t married, an\' never like ter\r\nbe,\' she answered.\r\n\r\n\'Liza \'as all the pleasures of a \'usband an\' none of the trouble.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bli\'me if I know wot yer mean!\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Na, of course not; you don\'t know nothin\', do yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'Innocent as a bibe. Our Father which art in \'eaven!\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Aven\'t been in London long, \'ave yer?\'\r\n\r\nThey spoke in chorus, and Liza stood in front of them, bewildered, not\r\nknowing what to answer.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you mike no mistake abaht it, Liza knows a thing or two.\'\r\n\r\n\'O me darlin\', I love yer fit to kill, but tike care your missus ain\'t\r\nround the corner.\' This was particularly bold, and they all laughed.\r\n\r\nLiza felt very uncomfortable, and fiddled about with her apron,\r\nwondering how she should get away.\r\n\r\n\'Tike care yer don\'t git into trouble, thet\'s all,\' said one of the\r\nmen, with burlesque gravity.\r\n\r\n\'Yer might give us a chanst, Liza, you come aht with me one evenin\'.\r\nYou oughter give us all a turn, just ter show there\'s no ill-feelin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bli\'me if I know wot yer all talkin\' abaht. You\'re all barmy on the\r\ncrumpet,\' said Liza indignantly, and, turning her back on them, made\r\nfor home.\r\n\r\nAmong other things that had happened was Sally\'s marriage. One\r\nSaturday a little procession had started from Vere Street, consisting\r\nof Sally, in a state of giggling excitement, her fringe magnificent\r\nafter a whole week of curling-papers, clad in a perfectly new\r\nvelveteen dress of the colour known as electric blue; and Harry,\r\nrather nervous and ill at ease in the unaccustomed restraint of a\r\ncollar; these two walked arm-in-arm, and were followed by Sally\'s\r\nmother and uncle, also arm-in-arm, and the procession was brought up\r\nby Harry\'s brother and a friend. They started with a flourish of\r\ntrumpets and an old boot, and walked down the middle of Vere Street,\r\naccompanied by the neighbours\' good wishes; but as they got into the\r\nWestminster Bridge Road and nearer to the church, the happy couple\r\ngrew silent, and Harry began to perspire freely, so that his collar\r\ngave him perfect torture. There was a public-house just opposite the\r\nchurch, and it was suggested that they should have a drink before\r\ngoing in. As it was a solemn occasion they went into the private bar,\r\nand there Sally\'s uncle, who was a man of means, ordered six pots of\r\nbeer.\r\n\r\n\'Feel a bit nervous, \'Arry?\' asked his friend.\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' said Harry, as if he had been used to getting married every day\r\nof his life; \'bit warm, thet\'s all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your very good \'ealth, Sally,\' said her mother, lifting her mug;\r\n\'this is the last time as I shall ever address you as miss.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' may she be as good a wife as you was,\' added Sally\'s uncle.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t think my old man ever \'ad no complaint ter mike abaht\r\nme. I did my duty by \'im, although it\'s me as says it,\' answered the\r\ngood lady.\r\n\r\n\'Well, mates,\' said Harry\'s brother, \'I reckon it\'s abaht time to go\r\nin. So \'ere\'s to the \'ealth of Mr. \'Enry Atkins an\' \'is future missus.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' God bless \'em!\' said Sally\'s mother.\r\n\r\nThen they went into the church, and as they solemnly walked up the\r\naisle a pale-faced young curate came out of the vestry and down to the\r\nbottom of the chancel. The beer had had a calming effect on their\r\ntroubled minds, and both Harry and Sally began to think it rather a\r\ngood joke. They smiled on each other, and at those parts of the\r\nservice which they thought suggestive violently nudged one another in\r\nthe ribs. When the ring had to be produced, Harry fumbled about in\r\ndifferent pockets, and his brother whispered:\r\n\r\n\'Swop me bob, \'e\'s gone and lorst it!\'\r\n\r\nHowever, all went right, and Sally having carefully pocketed the\r\ncertificate, they went out and had another drink to celebrate the\r\nhappy event.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Liza and several friends came into the couple\'s room,\r\nwhich they had taken in the same house as Sally had lived in before,\r\nand drank the health of the bride and bridegroom till they thought fit\r\nto retire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was November. The fine weather had quite gone now, and with it much\r\nof the sweet pleasure of Jim and Liza\'s love. When they came out at\r\nnight on the Embankment they found it cold and dreary; sometimes a\r\nlight fog covered the river-banks, and made the lamps glow out dim and\r\nlarge; a light rain would be falling, which sent a chill into their\r\nvery souls; foot passengers came along at rare intervals, holding up\r\numbrellas, and staring straight in front of them as they hurried along\r\nin the damp and cold; a cab would pass rapidly by, splashing up the\r\nmud on each side. The benches were deserted, except, perhaps, for some\r\npoor homeless wretch who could afford no shelter, and, huddled up in a\r\ncorner, with his head buried in his breast, was sleeping heavily, like\r\na dead man. The wet mud made Liza\'s skirts cling about her feet, and\r\nthe damp would come in and chill her legs and creep up her body, till\r\nshe shivered, and for warmth pressed herself close against Jim.\r\nSometimes they would go into the third-class waiting-rooms at Waterloo\r\nor Charing Cross and sit there, but it was not like the park or the\r\nEmbankment on summer nights; they had warmth, but the heat made their\r\nwet clothes steam and smell, and the gas flared in their eyes, and\r\nthey hated the people perpetually coming in and out, opening the doors\r\nand letting in a blast of cold air; they hated the noise of the guards\r\nand porters shouting out the departure of the trains, the shrill\r\nwhistling of the steam-engine, the hurry and bustle and confusion.\r\nAbout eleven o\'clock, when the trains grew less frequent, they got\r\nsome quietness; but then their minds were troubled, and they felt\r\nheavy, sad and miserable.\r\n\r\nOne evening they had been sitting at Waterloo Station; it was foggy\r\noutside--a thick, yellow November fog, which filled the waiting-room,\r\nentering the lungs, and making the mouth taste nasty and the eyes\r\nsmart. It was about half-past eleven, and the station was unusually\r\nquiet; a few passengers, in wraps and overcoats, were walking to and\r\nfro, waiting for the last train, and one or two porters were standing\r\nabout yawning. Liza and Jim had remained for an hour in perfect\r\nsilence, filled with a gloomy unhappiness, as of a great weight on\r\ntheir brains. Liza was sitting forward, with her elbows on her knees,\r\nresting her face on her hands.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I was straight,\' she said at last, not looking up.\r\n\r\n\'Well, why won\'t yer come along of me altogether, an\' you\'ll be\r\narright then?\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'Na, that\'s no go; I can\'t do thet.\' He had often asked her to live\r\nwith him entirely, but she had always refused.\r\n\r\n\'You can come along of me, an\' I\'ll tike a room in a lodgin\' \'ouse in\r\n\'Olloway, an\' we can live there as if we was married.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot abaht yer work?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can get work over the other side as well as I can \'ere. I\'m abaht\r\nsick of the wy things is goin\' on.\'\r\n\r\n\'So am I; but I can\'t leave mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'She can come, too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not when I\'m not married. I shouldn\'t like \'er ter know as I\'d--as\r\nI\'d gone wrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll marry yer. Swop me bob, I wants ter badly enough.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer can\'t; yer married already.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet don\'t matter! If I give the missus so much a week aht of my\r\nscrew, she\'ll sign a piper ter give up all clime ter me, an\' then we\r\ncan get spliced. One of the men as I works with done thet, an\' it was\r\narright.\'\r\n\r\nLiza shook her head.\r\n\r\n\'Na, yer can\'t do thet now; it\'s bigamy, an\' the cop tikes yer, an\'\r\nyer gits twelve months\' \'ard for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But swop me bob, Liza, I can\'t go on like this. Yer knows the\r\nmissus--well, there ain\'t no bloomin\' doubt abaht it, she knows as you\r\nan\' me are carryin\' on, an\' she mikes no bones abaht lettin\' me see\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'She don\'t do thet?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, she don\'t exactly sy it, but she sulks an\' won\'t speak, an\'\r\nthen when I says anythin\' she rounds on me an\' calls me all the nimes\r\nshe can think of. I\'d give \'er a good \'idin\', but some\'ow I don\'t like\r\nter! She mikes the plice a \'ell ter me, an\' I\'m not goin\' ter stand it\r\nno longer!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll ave ter sit it, then; yer can\'t chuck it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus I can, an\' I would if you\'d come along of me. I don\'t believe you\r\nlike me at all, Liza, or you\'d come.\'\r\n\r\nShe turned towards him and put her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know I do, old cock,\' she said. \'I like yer better than anyone\r\nelse in the world; but I can\'t go awy an\' leave mother.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bli\'me me if I see why; she\'s never been much ter you. She mikes yer\r\nslave awy ter pay the rent, an\' all the money she earns she boozes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s true, she ain\'t been wot yer might call a good mother ter\r\nme--but some\'ow she\'s my mother, an\' I don\'t like ter leave \'er on \'er\r\nown, now she\'s so old--an\' she can\'t do much with the rheumatics. An\'\r\nbesides, Jim dear, it ain\'t only mother, but there\'s yer own kids, yer\r\ncan\'t leave them.\'\r\n\r\nHe thought for a while, and then said:\r\n\r\n\'You\'re abaht right there, Liza; I dunno if I could get on without the\r\nkids. If I could only tike them an\' you too, swop me bob, I should be\r\n\'appy.\'\r\n\r\nLiza smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\'So yer see, Jim, we\'re in a bloomin\' \'ole, an\' there ain\'t no way aht\r\nof it thet I can see.\'\r\n\r\nHe took her on his knees, and pressing her to him, kissed her very\r\nlong and very lovingly.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we must trust ter luck,\' she said again, \'p\'raps somethin\' \'ll\r\n\'appen soon, an\' everythin\' \'ll come right in the end--when we gets\r\nfour balls of worsted for a penny.\'\r\n\r\nIt was past twelve, and separating, they went by different ways along\r\nthe dreary, wet, deserted roads till they came to Vere Street.\r\n\r\nThe street seemed quite different to Liza from what it had been three\r\nmonths before. Tom, the humble adorer, had quite disappeared from her\r\nlife. One day, three or four weeks after the August Bank Holiday, she\r\nsaw him dawdling along the pavement, and it suddenly struck her that\r\nshe had not seen him for a long time; but she had been so full of her\r\nhappiness that she had been unable to think of anyone but Jim. She\r\nwondered at his absence, since before wherever she had been there was\r\nhe certain to be also. She passed him, but to her astonishment he did\r\nnot speak to her. She thought by some wonder he had not seen her, but\r\nshe felt his gaze resting upon her. She turned back, and suddenly he\r\ndropped his eyes and looked down, walking on as if he had not seen\r\nher, but blushing furiously.\r\n\r\n\'Tom,\' she said, \'why don\'t yer speak ter me.\'\r\n\r\nHe started and blushed more than ever.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know yer was there,\' he stuttered.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t tell me,\' she said, \'wot\'s up?\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothin\' as I knows of,\' he answered uneasily.\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t offended yer, \'ave I, Tom?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, not as I knows of,\' he replied, looking very unhappy.\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t ever come my way now,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know as yer wanted ter see me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! Yer knows I likes you as well as anybody.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer likes so many people, Liza,\' he said, flushing.\r\n\r\n\'What d\'yer mean?\' said Liza indignantly, but very red; she was afraid\r\nhe knew now, and it was from him especially she would have been so\r\nglad to hide it.\r\n\r\n\'Nothin\',\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'One doesn\'t say things like thet without any meanin\', unless one\'s a\r\nblimed fool.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re right there, Liza,\' he answered. \'I am a blimed fool.\' He\r\nlooked at her a little reproachfully, she thought, and then he said\r\n\'Good-bye,\' and turned away.\r\n\r\nAt first she was horrified that he should know of her love for Jim,\r\nbut then she did not care. After all, it was nobody\'s business, and\r\nwhat did anything matter as long as she loved Jim and Jim loved her?\r\nThen she grew angry that Tom should suspect her; he could know nothing\r\nbut that some of the men had seen her with Jim near Vauxhall, and it\r\nseemed mean that he should condemn her for that. Thenceforward, when\r\nshe ran against Tom, she cut him; he never tried to speak to her, but\r\nas she passed him, pretending to look in front of her, she could see\r\nthat he always blushed, and she fancied his eyes were very sorrowful.\r\nThen several weeks went by, and as she began to feel more and more\r\nlonely in the street she regretted the quarrel; she cried a little as\r\nshe thought that she had lost his faithful gentle love and she would\r\nhave much liked to be friends with him again. If he had only made some\r\nadvance she would have welcomed him so cordially, but she was too\r\nproud to go to him herself and beg him to forgive her--and then how\r\ncould he forgive her?\r\n\r\nShe had lost Sally too, for on her marriage Harry had made her give up\r\nthe factory; he was a young man with principles worthy of a Member of\r\nParliament, and he had said:\r\n\r\n\'A woman\'s plice is \'er \'ome, an\' if \'er old man can\'t afford ter keep\r\n\'er without \'er workin\' in a factory--well, all I can say is thet \'e\'d\r\nbetter go an\' git single.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite right, too,\' agreed his mother-in-law; \'an\' wot\'s more, she\'ll\r\n\'ave a baby ter look after soon, an\' thet\'ll tike \'er all \'er time,\r\nan\' there\'s no one as knows thet better than me, for I\'ve \'ad twelve,\r\nter sy nothin\' of two stills an\' one miss.\'\r\n\r\nLiza quite envied Sally her happiness, for the bride was brimming\r\nover with song and laughter; her happiness overwhelmed her.\r\n\r\n\'I am \'appy,\' she said to Liza one day a few weeks after her marriage.\r\n\'You dunno wot a good sort \'Arry is. \'E\'s just a darlin\', an\' there\'s\r\nno mistikin\' it. I don\'t care wot other people sy, but wot I says is,\r\nthere\'s nothin\' like marriage. Never a cross word passes his lips, an\'\r\nmother \'as all \'er meals with us an\' \'e says all the better. Well I\'m\r\nthet \'appy I simply dunno if I\'m standin\' on my \'ead or on my \'eels.\'\r\n\r\nBut alas! it did not last too long. Sally was not so full of joy when\r\nnext Liza met her, and one day her eyes looked very much as if she had\r\nbeen crying.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the matter?\' asked Liza, looking at her. \'Wot \'ave yer been\r\nblubberin\' abaht?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me?\' said Sally, getting very red. \'Oh, I\'ve got a bit of a\r\ntoothache, an\'--well, I\'m rather a fool like, an\' it \'urt so much that\r\nI couldn\'t \'elp cryin\'.\'\r\n\r\nLiza was not satisfied, but could get nothing further out of her. Then\r\none day it came out. It was a Saturday night, the time when women in\r\nVere Street weep. Liza went up into Sally\'s room for a few minutes on\r\nher way to the Westminster Bridge Road, where she was to meet Jim.\r\nHarry had taken the top back room, and Liza, climbing up the second\r\nflight of stairs, called out as usual.\r\n\r\n\'Wot ho, Sally!\'\r\n\r\nThe door remained shut, although Liza could see that there was a light\r\nin the room; but on getting to the door she stood still, for she heard\r\nthe sound of sobbing. She listened for a minute and then knocked:\r\nthere was a little flurry inside, and someone called out:\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo\'s there?\'\r\n\r\n\'Only me,\' said Liza, opening the door. As she did so she saw Sally\r\nrapidly wipe her eyes and put her handkerchief away. Her mother was\r\nsitting by her side, evidently comforting her.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s up, Sal?\' asked Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Nothin\',\' answered Sally, with a brave little gasp to stop the\r\ncrying, turning her face downwards so that Liza should not see the\r\ntears in her eyes; but they were too strong for her, and, quickly\r\ntaking out her handkerchief, she hid her face in it and began to sob\r\nbroken-heartedly. Liza looked at the mother in interrogation.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s thet man again!\' said the lady, snorting and tossing her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\'Not \'Arry?\' asked Liza, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Not \'Arry--\'oo is it if it ain\'t \'Arry? The villin!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s \'e been doin\', then?\' asked Liza again.\r\n\r\n\'Beatin\' \'er, that\'s wot \'e\'s been doin\'! Oh, the villin, \'e oughter\r\nbe ashimed of \'isself \'e ought!\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know \'e was like that!\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t yer? I thought the \'ole street knew it by now,\' said Mrs.\r\nCooper indignantly. \'Oh, \'e\'s a wrong \'un, \'e is.\'\r\n\r\n\'It wasn\'t \'is fault,\' put in Sally, amidst her sobs; \'it\'s only\r\nbecause \'e\'s \'ad a little drop too much. \'E\'s arright when \'e\'s\r\nsober.\'\r\n\r\n\'A little drop too much! I should just think \'e\'d \'ad, the beast! I\'d\r\ngive it \'im if I was a man. They\'re all like thet--\'usbinds is all\r\nalike; they\'re arright when they\'re sober--sometimes--but when they\'ve\r\ngot the liquor in \'em, they\'re beasts, an\' no mistike. I \'ad a \'usbind\r\nmyself for five-an\'-twenty years, an\' I know \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, mother,\' sobbed Sally, \'it was all my fault. I should \'ave come\r\n\'ome earlier.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, it wasn\'t your fault at all. Just you look \'ere, Liza: this is\r\nwot \'e done an\' call \'isself a man. Just because Sally\'d gone aht to\r\n\'ave a chat with Mrs. McLeod in the next \'ouse, when she come in \'e\r\nstart bangin\' \'er abaht. An\' me, too, wot d\'yer think of that!\' Mrs.\r\nCooper was quite purple with indignation.\r\n\r\n\'Yus,\' she went on, \'thet\'s a man for yer. Of course, I wasn\'t goin\'\r\nter stand there an\' see my daughter bein\' knocked abaht; it wasn\'t\r\nlikely--was it? An\' \'e rounds on me, an\' \'e \'its me with \'is fist.\r\nLook \'ere.\' She pulled up her sleeves and showed two red and brawny\r\narms. \'\'E\'s bruised my arms; I thought \'e\'d broken it at fust. If I\r\n\'adn\'t put my arm up, \'e\'d \'ave got me on the \'ead, an\' \'e might \'ave\r\nkilled me. An\' I says to \'im, "If you touch me again, I\'ll go ter the\r\npolice-station, thet I will!" Well, that frightened \'im a bit, an\'\r\nthen didn\'t I let \'im \'ave it! "You call yerself a man," says I, "an\'\r\nyou ain\'t fit ter clean the drains aht." You should \'ave \'eard the\r\nlanguage \'e used. "You dirty old woman," says \'e, "you go away; you\'re\r\nalways interferin\' with me." Well, I don\'t like ter repeat wot \'e\r\nsaid, and thet\'s the truth. An\' I says ter \'im, "I wish yer\'d never\r\nmarried my daughter, an\' if I\'d known you was like this I\'d \'ave died\r\nsooner than let yer."\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I didn\'t know \'e was like thet!\' said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'\'E was arright at fust,\' said Sally.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, they\'re always arright at fust! But ter think it should \'ave\r\ncome to this now, when they ain\'t been married three months, an\' the\r\nfirst child not born yet! I think it\'s disgraceful.\'\r\n\r\nLiza stayed a little while longer, helping to comfort Sally, who kept\r\npathetically taking to herself all the blame of the dispute; and then,\r\nbidding her good night and better luck, she slid off to meet Jim.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the appointed spot he was not to be found. She waited\r\nfor some time, and at last saw him come out of the neighbouring pub.\r\n\r\n\'Good night, Jim,\' she said as she came up to him.\r\n\r\n\'So you\'ve turned up, \'ave yer?\' he answered roughly, turning round.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the matter, Jim?\' she asked in a frightened way, for he had\r\nnever spoken to her in that manner.\r\n\r\n\'Nice thing ter keep me witin\' all night for yer to come aht.\'\r\n\r\nShe saw that he had been drinking, and answered humbly.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very sorry, Jim, but I went in to Sally, an\' \'er bloke \'ad been\r\nknockin\' \'er abaht, an\' so I sat with \'er a bit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Knockin\' \'er abaht, \'ad \'e? and serve \'er damn well right too; an\'\r\nthere\'s many more as could do with a good \'idin\'!\'\r\n\r\nLiza did not answer. He looked at her, and then suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\'Come in an\' \'ave a drink.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I\'m not thirsty; I don\'t want a drink,\' she answered.\r\n\r\n\'Come on,\' he said angrily.\r\n\r\n\'Na, Jim, you\'ve had quite enough already.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo are you talkin\' ter?\' he said. \'Don\'t come if yer don\'t want ter;\r\nI\'ll go an\' \'ave one by myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Jim, don\'t.\' She caught hold of his arm.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I shall,\' he said, going towards the pub, while she held him\r\nback. \'Let me go, can\'t yer! Let me go!\' He roughly pulled his arm\r\naway from her. As she tried to catch hold of it again, he pushed her\r\nback, and in the little scuffle caught her a blow over the face.\r\n\r\n\'Oh!\' she cried, \'you did \'urt!\'\r\n\r\nHe was sobered at once.\r\n\r\n\'Liza,\' he said. \'I ain\'t \'urt yer?\' She didn\'t answer, and he took\r\nher in his arms. \'Liza, I ain\'t \'urt you, \'ave I? Say I ain\'t \'urt\r\nyer. I\'m so sorry, I beg your pardon, Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Arright, old chap,\' she said, smiling charmingly on him. \'It wasn\'t\r\nthe blow that \'urt me much; it was the wy you was talkin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t mean it, Liza.\' He was so contrite, he could not humble\r\nhimself enough. \'I \'ad another bloomin\' row with the missus ter-night,\r\nan\' then when I didn\'t find you \'ere, an\' I kept witin\' an\'\r\nwitin\'--well, I fair downright lost my \'air. An\' I \'ad two or three\r\npints of four \'alf, an\'--well, I dunno--\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, old cock. I can stand more than thet as long as yer loves\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and they were quite friends again. But the little\r\nquarrel had another effect which was worse for Liza. When she woke up\r\nnext morning she noticed a slight soreness over the ridge of bone\r\nunder the left eye, and on looking in the glass saw that it was black\r\nand blue and green. She bathed it, but it remained, and seemed to get\r\nmore marked. She was terrified lest people should see it, and kept\r\nindoors all day; but next morning it was blacker than ever. She went\r\nto the factory with her hat over her eyes and her head bent down; she\r\nescaped observation, but on the way home she was not so lucky. The\r\nsharp eyes of some girls noticed it first.\r\n\r\n\'Wot\'s the matter with yer eye?\' asked one of them.\r\n\r\n\'Me?\' answered Liza, putting her hand up as if in ignorance. \'Nothin\'\r\nthet I knows of.\'\r\n\r\nTwo or three young men were standing by, and hearing the girl, looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\'Why, yer\'ve got a black eye, Liza!\'\r\n\r\n\'Me? I ain\'t got no black eye!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus you \'ave; \'ow d\'yer get it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I dunno,\' said Liza. \'I didn\'t know I \'ad one.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! tell us another!\' was the answer. \'One doesn\'t git a black eye\r\nwithout knowin\' \'ow they got it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I did fall against the chest of drawers yesterday; I suppose I\r\nmust \'ave got it then.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, we believe thet, don\'t we?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t know \'e was so \'andy with \'is dukes, did you, Ted?\' asked\r\none man of another.\r\n\r\nLiza felt herself grow red to the tips of her toes.\r\n\r\n\'Who?\' she asked.\r\n\r\n\'Never you mind; nobody you know.\'\r\n\r\nAt that moment Jim\'s wife passed and looked at her with a scowl. Liza\r\nwished herself a hundred miles away, and blushed more violently than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\'Wot are yer blushin\' abaht?\' ingenuously asked one of the girls.\r\n\r\nAnd they all looked from her to Mrs. Blakeston and back again. Someone\r\nsaid: \'\'Ow abaht our Sunday boots on now?\' And a titter went through\r\nthem. Liza\'s nerve deserted her; she could think of nothing to say,\r\nand a sob burst from her. To hide the tears which were coming from her\r\neyes she turned away and walked homewards. Immediately a great shout\r\nof laughter broke from the group, and she heard them positively\r\nscreaming till she got into her own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Liza was talking with Sally, who did not seem\r\nvery much happier than when Liza had last seen her.\r\n\r\n\'\'E ain\'t wot I thought \'e wos,\' she said. \'I don\'t mind sayin\' thet;\r\nbut \'e \'as a lot ter put up with; I expect I\'m rather tryin\'\r\nsometimes, an\' \'e means well. P\'raps \'e\'ll be kinder like when the\r\nbiby\'s born.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cheer up, old gal,\' answered Liza, who had seen something of the\r\nlives of many married couples; \'it won\'t seem so bad after yer gets\r\nused to it; it\'s a bit disappointin\' at fust, but yer gits not ter\r\nmind it.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a little Sally said she must go and see about her husband\'s tea.\r\nShe said good-bye, and then rather awkwardly:\r\n\r\n\'Say, Liza, tike care of yerself!\'\r\n\r\n\'Tike care of meself--why?\' asked Liza, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know wot I mean.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I\'m darned if I do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet there Mrs. Blakeston, she\'s lookin\' aht for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. Blakeston!\' Liza was startled.\r\n\r\n\'Yus; she says she\'s goin\' ter give you somethin\' if she can git \'old\r\non yer. I should advise yer ter tike care.\'\r\n\r\n\'Me?\' said Liza.\r\n\r\nSally looked away, so as not to see the other\'s face.\r\n\r\n\'She says as \'ow yer\'ve been messin\' abaht with \'er old man.\'\r\n\r\nLiza didn\'t say anything, and Sally, repeating her good-bye, slid off.\r\n\r\nLiza felt a chill run through her. She had several times noticed a\r\nscowl and a look of anger on Mrs. Blakeston\'s face, and she had avoided\r\nher as much as possible; but she had no idea that the woman meant to\r\ndo anything to her. She was very frightened, a cold sweat broke out\r\nover her face. If Mrs. Blakeston got hold of her she would be helpless,\r\nshe was so small and weak, while the other was strong and muscular.\r\nLiza wondered what she would do if she did catch her.\r\n\r\nThat night she told Jim, and tried to make a joke of it.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Jim, your missus--she says she\'s goin\' ter give me socks if\r\nshe catches me.\'\r\n\r\n\'My missus! \'Ow d\'yer know?\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s been tellin\' people in the street.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go\' lumme,\' said Jim, furious, \'if she dares ter touch a \'air of your\r\n\'ead, swop me dicky I\'ll give \'er sich a \'idin\' as she never \'ad\r\nbefore! By God, give me the chanst, an\' I would let \'er \'ave it; I\'m\r\nbloomin\' well sick of \'er sulks!\' He clenched his fist as he spoke.\r\n\r\nLiza was a coward. She could not help thinking of her enemy\'s threat;\r\nit got on her nerves, and she hardly dared go out for fear of meeting\r\nher; she would look nervously in front of her, quickly turning round\r\nif she saw in the distance anyone resembling Mrs. Blakeston. She\r\ndreamed of her at night; she saw the big, powerful form, the heavy,\r\nfrowning face, and the curiously braided brown hair; and she would\r\nwake up with a cry and find herself bathed in sweat.\r\n\r\nIt was the Saturday afternoon following this, a chill November day,\r\nwith the roads sloshy, and a grey, comfortless sky that made one\'s\r\nspirits sink. It was about three o\'clock, and Liza was coming home\r\nfrom work; she got into Vere Street, and was walking quickly towards\r\nher house when she saw Mrs. Blakeston coming towards her. Her heart\r\ngave a great jump. Turning, she walked rapidly in the direction she\r\nhad come; with a screw round of her eyes she saw that she was being\r\nfollowed, and therefore went straight out of Vere Street. She went\r\nright round, meaning to get into the street from the other end and,\r\nunobserved, slip into her house, which was then quite close; but she\r\ndared not risk it immediately for fear Mrs. Blakeston should still be\r\nthere; so she waited about for half an hour. It seemed an age.\r\nFinally, taking her courage in both hands, she turned the corner and\r\nentered Vere Street. She nearly ran into the arms of Mrs. Blakeston,\r\nwho was standing close to the public-house door.\r\n\r\nLiza gave a little cry, and the woman said, with a sneer:\r\n\r\n\'Yer didn\'t expect ter see me, did yer?\'\r\n\r\nLiza did not answer, but tried to walk past her. Mrs. Blakeston stepped\r\nforward and blocked her way.\r\n\r\n\'Yer seem ter be in a mighty fine \'urry,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I\'ve got ter git \'ome,\' said Liza, again trying to pass.\r\n\r\n\'But supposin\' I don\'t let yer?\' remarked Mrs. Blakeston, preventing\r\nher from moving.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t yer leave me alone?\' Liza said. \'I ain\'t interferin\' with\r\nyou!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not interferin\' with me, aren\'t yer? I like thet!\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me go by,\' said Liza. \'I don\'t want ter talk ter you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I know thet,\' said the other; \'but I want ter talk ter you, an\' I\r\nshan\'t let yer go until I\'ve said wot I wants ter sy.\'\r\n\r\nLiza looked round for help. At the beginning of the altercation the\r\nloafers about the public-house had looked up with interest, and\r\ngradually gathered round in a little circle. Passers-by had joined in,\r\nand a number of other people in the street, seeing the crowd, added\r\nthemselves to it to see what was going on. Liza saw that all eyes were\r\nfixed on her, the men amused and excited, the women unsympathetic,\r\nrather virtuously indignant. Liza wanted to ask for help, but there\r\nwere so many people, and they all seemed so much against her, that she\r\nhad not the courage to. So, having surveyed the crowd, she turned her\r\neyes to Mrs. Blakeston, and stood in front of her, trembling a little,\r\nand very white.\r\n\r\n\'Na, \'e ain\'t there,\' said Mrs. Blakeston, sneeringly, \'so yer needn\'t\r\nlook for \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'I dunno wot yer mean,\' answered Liza, \'an\' I want ter go awy. I ain\'t\r\ndone nothin\' ter you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not done nothin\' ter me?\' furiously repeated the woman. \'I\'ll tell\r\nyer wot yer\'ve done ter me--you\'ve robbed me of my \'usbind, you \'ave.\r\nI never \'ad a word with my \'usbind until you took \'im from me. An\' now\r\nit\'s all you with \'im. \'E\'s got no time for \'is wife an\' family--it\'s\r\nall you. An\' \'is money, too. I never git a penny of it; if it weren\'t\r\nfor the little bit I \'ad saved up in the siving-bank, me an\' my\r\nchildren \'ud be starvin\' now! An\' all through you!\' She shook her fist\r\nat her.\r\n\r\n\'I never \'ad any money from anyone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\' talk ter me; I know yer did. Yer dirty bitch! You oughter be\r\nishimed of yourself tikin\' a married man from \'is family, an\' \'im old\r\nenough ter be yer father.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s right there!\' said one or two of the onlooking women. \'There\r\ncan\'t be no good in \'er if she tikes somebody else\'s \'usbind.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll give it yer!\' proceeded Mrs. Blakeston, getting more hot and\r\nexcited, brandishing her fist, and speaking in a loud voice, hoarse\r\nwith rage. \'Oh, I\'ve been tryin\' ter git \'old on yer this four weeks.\r\nWhy, you\'re a prostitute--that\'s wot you are!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not!\' answered Liza indignantly.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, you are,\' repeated Mrs. Blakeston, advancing menacingly, so that\r\nLiza shrank back. \'An\' wot\'s more, \'e treats yer like one. I know \'oo\r\ngive yer thet black eye; thet shows what \'e thinks of yer! An\' serve\r\nyer bloomin\' well right if \'e\'d give yer one in both eyes!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Blakeston stood close in front of her, her heavy jaw protruded and\r\nthe frown of her eyebrows dark and stern. For a moment she stood\r\nsilent, contemplating Liza, while the surrounders looked on in\r\nbreathless interest.\r\n\r\n\'Yer dirty little bitch, you!\' she said at last. \'Tike that!\' and with\r\nher open hand she gave her a sharp smack on the cheek.\r\n\r\nLiza started back with a cry and put her hand up to her face.\r\n\r\n\'An\' tike thet!\' added Mrs. Blakeston, repeating the blow. Then,\r\ngathering up the spittle in her mouth, she spat in Liza\'s face.\r\n\r\nLiza sprang on her, and with her hands spread out like claws buried\r\nher nails in the woman\'s face and drew them down her cheeks. Mrs.\r\nBlakeston caught hold of her hair with both hands and tugged at it as\r\nhard as she could. But they were immediately separated.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere, \'old \'ard!\' said some of the men. \'Fight it aht fair and\r\nsquare. Don\'t go scratchin\' and maulin\' like thet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll fight \'er, I don\'t mind!\' shouted Mrs. Blakeston, tucking up her\r\nsleeves and savagely glaring at her opponent.\r\n\r\nLiza stood in front of her, pale and trembling; as she looked at her\r\nenemy, and saw the long red marks of her nails, with blood coming from\r\none or two of them, she shrank back.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want ter fight,\' she said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\'Na, I don\'t suppose yer do,\' hissed the other, \'but yer\'ll damn well\r\n\'ave ter!\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s ever so much bigger than me; I\'ve got no chanst,\' added Liza\r\ntearfully.\r\n\r\n\'You should \'ave thought of thet before. Come on!\' and with these\r\nwords Mrs. Blakeston rushed upon her. She hit her with both fists one\r\nafter the other. Liza did not try to guard herself, but imitating the\r\nwoman\'s motion, hit out with her own fists; and for a minute or two\r\nthey continued thus, raining blows on one another with the same\r\nwindmill motion of the arms. But Liza could not stand against the\r\nother woman\'s weight; the blows came down heavy and rapid all over her\r\nface and head. She put up her hands to cover her face and turned her\r\nhead away, while Mrs. Blakeston kept on hitting mercilessly.\r\n\r\n\'Time!\' shouted some of the men--\'Time!\' and Mrs. Blakeston stopped to\r\nrest herself.\r\n\r\n\'It don\'t seem \'ardly fair to set them two on tergether. Liza\'s got no\r\nchanst against a big woman like thet,\' said a man among the crowd.\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s er\' own fault,\' answered a woman; \'she didn\'t oughter mess\r\nabout with \'er \'usbind.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t think it\'s right,\' added another man. \'She\'s gettin\' it\r\ntoo much.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' serve \'er right too!\' said one of the women. \'She deserves all\r\nshe gets an\' a damn sight more inter the bargain.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite right,\' put in a third; \'a woman\'s got no right ter tike\r\nsomeone\'s \'usbind from \'er. An\' if she does she\'s bloomin\' lucky if\r\nshe gits off with a \'idin\'--thet\'s wot I think.\'\r\n\r\n\'So do I. But I wouldn\'t \'ave thought it of Liza. I never thought she\r\nwas a wrong \'un.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pretty specimen she is!\' said a little dark woman, who looked like a\r\nJewess. \'If she messed abaht with my old man, I\'d stick \'er--I swear I\r\nwould!\'\r\n\r\n\'Now she\'s been carryin\' on with one, she\'ll try an\' git others--you\r\nsee if she don\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'d better not come round my \'ouse; I\'ll soon give \'er wot for.\'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Liza was standing at one corner of the ring, trembling all\r\nover and crying bitterly. One of her eyes was bunged up, and her hair,\r\nall dishevelled, was hanging down over her face. Two young fellows,\r\nwho had constituted themselves her seconds, were standing in front of\r\nher, offering rather ironical comfort. One of them had taken the\r\nbottom corners of her apron and was fanning her with it, while the\r\nother was showing her how to stand and hold her arms.\r\n\r\n\'You stand up to \'er, Liza,\' he was saying; \'there ain\'t no good\r\nfunkin\' it, you\'ll simply get it all the worse. You \'it \'er back. Give\r\n\'er one on the boko, like this--see; yer must show a bit of pluck, yer\r\nknow.\'\r\n\r\nLiza tried to check her sobs.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, \'it \'er \'ard, that\'s wot yer\'ve got ter do,\' said the other.\r\n\'An\' if yer find she\'s gettin\' the better on yer, you close on \'er and\r\ncatch \'old of \'er \'air and scratch \'er.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve marked \'er with yer nails, Liza. By gosh, you did fly on her\r\nwhen she spat at yer! thet\'s the way ter do the job!\'\r\n\r\nThen turning to his fellow, he said:\r\n\r\n\'D\'yer remember thet fight as old Mother Cregg \'ad with another woman\r\nin the street last year?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' he answered, \'I never saw thet.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was a cawker; an\' the cops come in and took \'em both off ter\r\nquod.\'\r\n\r\nLiza wished the policemen would come and take her off; she would\r\nwillingly have gone to prison to escape the fiend in front of her; but\r\nno help came.\r\n\r\n\'Time\'s up!\' shouted the referee. \'Fire away!\'\r\n\r\n\'Tike care of the cops!\' shouted a man.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s no fear abaht them,\' answered somebody else. \'They always\r\nkeeps out of the way when there\'s anythin\' goin\' on.\'\r\n\r\n\'Fire away!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Blakeston attacked Liza madly; but the girl stood up bravely, and\r\nas well as she could gave back the blows she received. The spectators\r\ngrew tremendously excited.\r\n\r\n\'Got \'im again!\' they shouted. \'Give it \'er, Liza, thet\'s a good\r\n\'un!--\'it \'er \'ard!\'\r\n\r\n\'Two ter one on the old \'un!\' shouted a sporting gentleman; but Liza\r\nfound no backers.\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t she standin\' up well now she\'s roused?\' cried someone.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, she\'s got some pluck in \'er, she \'as!\'\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s a knock-aht!\' they shouted as Mrs. Blakeston brought her fist\r\ndown on to Liza\'s nose; the girl staggered back, and blood began to\r\nflow. Then, losing all fear, mad with rage, she made a rush on her\r\nenemy, and rained down blows all over her nose and eyes and mouth. The\r\nwoman recoiled at the sudden violence of the onslaught, and the men\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\'By God, the little \'un\'s gettin\' the best of it!\'\r\n\r\nBut quickly recovering herself the woman closed with Liza, and dug her\r\nnails into her flesh. Liza caught hold of her hair and pulled with all\r\nher might, and turning her teeth on Mrs. Blakeston tried to bite her.\r\nAnd thus for a minute they swayed about, scratching, tearing, biting,\r\nsweat and blood pouring down their faces, and their eyes fixed on one\r\nanother, bloodshot and full of rage. The audience shouted and cheered\r\nand clapped their hands.\r\n\r\n\'Wot the \'ell\'s up \'ere?\'\r\n\r\n\'I sy, look there,\' said some of the women in a whisper. \'It\'s the\r\n\'usbind!\'\r\n\r\nHe stood on tiptoe and looked over the crowd.\r\n\r\n\'My Gawd,\' he said, \'it\'s Liza!\'\r\n\r\nThen roughly pushing the people aside, he made his way through the\r\ncrowd into the centre, and thrusting himself between the two women,\r\ntore them apart. He turned furiously on his wife.\r\n\r\n\'By Gawd, I\'ll give yer somethin\' for this!\'\r\n\r\nAnd for a moment they all three stood silently looking at one another.\r\n\r\nAnother man had been attracted by the crowd, and he, too, pushed his\r\nway through.\r\n\r\n\'Come \'ome, Liza,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Tom!\'\r\n\r\nHe took hold of her arm, and led her through the people, who gave way\r\nto let her pass. They walked silently through the street, Tom very\r\ngrave, Liza weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Tom,\' she sobbed after a while, \'I couldn\'t \'elp it!\' Then, when\r\nher tears permitted, \'I did love \'im so!\'\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the door she plaintively said: \'Come in,\' and he\r\nfollowed her to her room. Here she sank on to a chair, and gave\r\nherself up to her tears.\r\n\r\nTom wetted the end of a towel and began wiping her face, grimy with\r\nblood and tears. She let him do it, just moaning amid her sobs:\r\n\r\n\'You are good ter me, Tom.\'\r\n\r\n\'Cheer up, old gal,\' he said kindly, \'it\'s all over now.\'\r\n\r\nAfter a while the excess of crying brought its cessation. She drank\r\nsome water, and then taking up a broken handglass she looked at\r\nherself, saying:\r\n\r\n\'I am a sight!\' and proceeded to wind up her hair. \'You \'ave been good\r\nter me, Tom,\' she repeated, her voice still broken with sobs; and as\r\nhe sat down beside her she took his hand.\r\n\r\n\'Na, I ain\'t,\' he answered; \'it\'s only wot anybody \'ud \'ave done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Tom,\' she said, after a little silence, \'I\'m so sorry I\r\nspoke cross like when I met yer in the street; you ain\'t spoke ter me\r\nsince.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, thet\'s all over now, old lidy, we needn\'t think of thet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but I \'ave treated yer bad. I\'m a regular wrong \'un, I am.\'\r\n\r\nHe pressed her hand without speaking.\r\n\r\n\'I say, Tom,\' she began, after another pause. \'Did yer know\r\nthet--well, you know--before ter-day?\'\r\n\r\nHe blushed as he answered:\r\n\r\n\'Yus.\'\r\n\r\nShe spoke very sadly and slowly.\r\n\r\n\'I thought yer did; yer seemed so cut up like when I used to meet yer.\r\nYer did love me then, Tom, didn\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'I do now, dearie,\' he answered.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, it\'s too lite now,\' she sighed.\r\n\r\n\'D\'yer know, Liza,\' he said, \'I just abaht kicked the life aht of a\r\nfeller \'cause \'e said you was messin\' abaht with--with \'im.\'\r\n\r\n\'An\' yer knew I was?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus--but I wasn\'t goin\' ter \'ave anyone say it before me.\'\r\n\r\n\'They\'ve all rounded on me except you, Tom. I\'d \'ave done better if\r\nI\'d tiken you when you arst me; I shouldn\'t be where I am now, if I\r\n\'ad.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, won\'t yer now? Won\'t yer \'ave me now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Me? After wot\'s \'appened?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I don\'t mind abaht thet. Thet don\'t matter ter me if you\'ll marry\r\nme. I fair can\'t live without yer, Liza--won\'t yer?\'\r\n\r\nShe groaned.\r\n\r\n\'Na, I can\'t, Tom, it wouldn\'t be right.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, not, if I don\'t mind?\'\r\n\r\n\'Tom,\' she said, looking down, almost whispering, \'I\'m like that--you\r\nknow!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot d\'yer mean?\'\r\n\r\nShe could scarcely utter the words--\r\n\r\n\'I think I\'m in the family wy.\'\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment; then spoke again.\r\n\r\n\'Well--I don\'t mind, if yer\'ll only marry me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I can\'t, Tom,\' she said, bursting into tears; \'I can\'t, but you\r\nare so good ter me; I\'d do anythin\' ter mike it up ter you.\'\r\n\r\nShe put her arms round his neck and slid on to his knees.\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Tom, I couldn\'t marry yer now; but anythin\' else--if yer\r\nwants me ter do anythin\' else, I\'ll do it if it\'ll mike you \'appy.\'\r\n\r\nHe did not understand, but only said:\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a good gal, Liza,\' and bending down he kissed her gravely on\r\nthe forehead.\r\n\r\nThen with a sigh he lifted her down, and getting up left her alone.\r\nFor a while she sat where he left her, but as she thought of all she\r\nhad gone through her loneliness and misery overcame her, the tears\r\nwelled forth, and throwing herself on the bed she buried her face in\r\nthe pillows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJim stood looking at Liza as she went off with Tom, and his wife\r\nwatched him jealously.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s \'er you\'re thinkin\' abaht. Of course you\'d \'ave liked ter tike\r\n\'er \'ome yerself, I know, an\' leave me to shift for myself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shut up!\' said Jim, angrily turning upon her.\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t shut up,\' she answered, raising her voice. \'Nice \'usbind you\r\nare. Go\' lumme, as good as they mike \'em! Nice thing ter go an\' leave\r\nyer wife and children for a thing like thet! At your age, too! You\r\noughter be ashimed of yerself. Why, it\'s like messin\' abaht with your\r\nown daughter!\'\r\n\r\n\'By God!\'--he ground his teeth with rage--\'if yer don\'t leave me\r\nalone, I\'ll kick the life aht of yer!\'\r\n\r\n\'There!\' she said, turning to the crowd--\'there, see \'ow \'e treats me!\r\nListen ter that! I\'ve been \'is wife for twenty years, an\' yer couldn\'t\r\n\'ave \'ad a better wife, an\' I\'ve bore \'im nine children, yet say\r\nnothin\' of a miscarriage, an\' I\'ve got another comin\', an\' thet\'s \'ow\r\n\'e treats me! Nice \'usbind, ain\'t it?\' She looked at him scornfully,\r\nthen again at the surrounders as if for their opinion.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I ain\'t goin\' ter stay \'ere all night; get aht of the light!\'\r\nHe pushed aside the people who barred his way, and the one or two who\r\ngrowled a little at his roughness, looking at his angry face, were\r\nafraid to complain.\r\n\r\n\'Look at \'im!\' said his wife. \'\'E\'s afraid, \'e is. See \'im slinkin\'\r\nawy like a bloomin\' mongrel with \'is tail between \'is legs. Ugh!\' She\r\nwalked just behind him, shouting and brandishing her arms.\r\n\r\n\'Yer dirty beast, you,\' she yelled, \'ter go foolin\' abaht with a\r\nlittle girl! Ugh! I wish yer wasn\'t my \'usbind; I wouldn\'t be seen\r\ndrowned with yer, if I could \'elp it. Yer mike me sick ter look at\r\nyer.\'\r\n\r\nThe crowd followed them on both sides of the road, keeping at a\r\ndiscreet distance, but still eagerly listening.\r\n\r\nJim turned on her once or twice and said:\r\n\r\n\'Shut up!\'\r\n\r\nBut it only made her more angry. \'I tell yer I shan\'t shut up. I don\'t\r\ncare \'oo knows it, you\'re a ----, you are! I\'m ashimed the children\r\nshould \'ave such a father as you. D\'yer think I didn\'t know wot you\r\nwas up ter them nights you was awy--courtin\', yus, courtin\'? You\'re a\r\nnice man, you are!\'\r\n\r\nJim did not answer her, but walked on. At last he turned round to the\r\npeople who were following and said:\r\n\r\n\'Na then, wot d\'you want \'ere? You jolly well clear, or I\'ll give some\r\nof you somethin\'!\'\r\n\r\nThey were mostly boys and women, and at his words they shrank back.\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s afraid ter sy anythin\' ter me,\' jeered Mrs. Blakeston. \'\'E\'s a\r\nbeauty!\'\r\n\r\nJim entered his house, and she followed him till they came up into\r\ntheir room. Polly was giving the children their tea. They all started\r\nup as they saw their mother with her hair and clothes in disorder,\r\nblotches of dried blood on her face, and the long scratch-marks.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, mother,\' said Polly, \'wot is the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'\'E\'s the matter.\' she answered, pointing to her husband. \'It\'s\r\nthrough \'im I\'ve got all this. Look at yer father, children; e\'s a\r\nfather to be proud of, leavin\' yer ter starve an\' spendin\' \'is week\'s\r\nmoney on a dirty little strumper.\'\r\n\r\nJim felt easier now he had not got so many strange eyes on him.\r\n\r\n\'Now, look \'ere,\' he said, \'I\'m not goin\' ter stand this much longer,\r\nso just you tike care.\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t frightened of yer. I know yer\'d like ter kill me, but yer\'ll\r\nget strung up if you do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I won\'t kill yer, but if I \'ave any more of your sauce I\'ll do\r\nthe next thing to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Touch me if yer dare,\' she said, \'I\'ll \'ave the law on you. An\' I\r\nshouldn\'t mind \'ow many month\'s \'ard you got.\'\r\n\r\n\'Be quiet!\' he said, and, closing his hand, gave her a heavy blow in\r\nthe chest that made her stagger.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you ----!\' she screamed.\r\n\r\nShe seized the poker, and in a fury of rage rushed at him.\r\n\r\n\'Would yer?\' he said, catching hold of it and wrenching it from her\r\ngrasp. He threw it to the end of the room and grappled with her. For a\r\nmoment they swayed about from side to side, then with an effort he\r\nlifted her off her feet and threw her to the ground; but she caught\r\nhold of him and he came down on the top of her. She screamed as her\r\nhead thumped down on the floor, and the children, who were standing\r\nhuddled up in a corner, terrified, screamed too.\r\n\r\nJim caught hold of his wife\'s head and began beating it against the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nShe cried out: \'You\'re killing me! Help! help!\'\r\n\r\nPolly in terror ran up to her father and tried to pull him off.\r\n\r\n\'Father, don\'t \'it \'er! Anythin\' but thet--for God\'s sike!\'\r\n\r\n\'Leave me alone,\' he said, \'or I\'ll give you somethin\' too.\'\r\n\r\nShe caught hold of his arm, but Jim, still kneeling on his wife, gave\r\nPolly a backhanded blow which sent her staggering back.\r\n\r\n\'Tike that!\'\r\n\r\nPolly ran out of the room, downstairs to the first-floor front, where\r\ntwo men and two women were sitting at tea.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, come an\' stop father!\' she cried. \'\'E\'s killin\' mother!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, wot\'s \'e doin\'?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, \'e\'s got \'er on the floor, an\' \'e\'s bangin\' \'er \'ead. \'E\'s payin\'\r\n\'er aht for givin\' Liza Kemp a \'idin\'.\'\r\n\r\nOne of the women started up and said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\'Come on, John, you go an\' stop it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you, John,\' said the other man. \'When a man\'s givin\' \'is wife\r\nsocks it\'s best not ter interfere.\'\r\n\r\n\'But \'e\'s killin\' \'er,\' repeated Polly, trembling with fright.\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' rejoined the man, \'she\'ll git over it; an\' p\'raps she deserves\r\nit, for all you know.\'\r\n\r\nJohn sat undecided, looking now at Polly, now at his wife, and now at\r\nthe other man.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, do be quick--for God\'s sike!\' said Polly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a sound as of something smashing was heard upstairs,\r\nand a woman\'s shriek. Mrs. Blakeston, in an effort to tear herself away\r\nfrom her husband, had knocked up against the wash-hand stand, and the\r\nwhole thing had crashed down.\r\n\r\n\'Go on, John,\' said the wife.\r\n\r\n\'No, I ain\'t goin\'; I shan\'t do no good, an\' \'e\'ll only round on me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you are a bloomin\' lot of cowards, thet\'s all I can say,\'\r\nindignantly answered the wife. \'But I ain\'t goin\' ter see a woman\r\nmurdered; I\'ll go an\' stop \'im.\'\r\n\r\nWith that she ran upstairs and threw open the door. Jim was still\r\nkneeling on his wife, hitting her furiously, while she was trying to\r\nprotect her head and face with her hands.\r\n\r\n\'Leave off!\' shouted the woman.\r\n\r\nJim looked up. \'\'Oo the devil are you?\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'Leave off, I tell yer. Aren\'t yer ashimed of yerself, knockin\' a\r\nwoman abaht like that?\' And she sprang at him, seizing his fist.\r\n\r\n\'Let go,\' he said, \'or I\'ll give you a bit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer\'d better not touch me,\' she said. \'Yer dirty coward! Why, look at\r\n\'er, she\'s almost senseless.\'\r\n\r\nJim stopped and gazed at his wife. He got up and gave her a kick.\r\n\r\n\'Git up!\' he said; but she remained huddled up on the floor, moaning\r\nfeebly. The woman from downstairs went on her knees and took her head\r\nin her arms.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Mrs. Blakeston. \'E\'s not goin\' ter touch yer. \'Ere, drink\r\nthis little drop of water.\' Then turning to Jim, with infinite\r\ndisdain: \'Yer dirty blackguard, you! If I was a man I\'d give you\r\nsomething for this.\'\r\n\r\nJim put on his hat and went out, slamming the door, while the woman\r\nshouted after him: \'Good riddance!\'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\'Lord love yer,\' said Mrs. Kemp, \'wot is the matter?\'\r\n\r\nShe had just come in, and opening the door had started back in\r\nsurprise at seeing Liza on the bed, all tears. Liza made no answer,\r\nbut cried as if her heart were breaking. Mrs. Kemp went up to her and\r\ntried to look at her face.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t cry, dearie; tell us wot it is.\'\r\n\r\nLiza sat up and dried her eyes.\r\n\r\n\'I am so un\'appy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wot \'ave yer been doin\' ter yer fice? My!\'\r\n\r\n\'Nothin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn! Yer can\'t \'ave got a fice like thet all by itself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I \'ad a bit of a scrimmage with a woman dahn the street,\' sobbed out\r\nLiza.\r\n\r\n\'She \'as give yer a doin\'; an\' yer all upset--an\' look at yer eye! I\r\nbrought in a little bit of stike for ter-morrer\'s dinner; you just cut\r\na bit off an\' put it over yer optic, that\'ll soon put it right. I\r\nalways used ter do thet myself when me an\' your poor father \'ad\r\nwords.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m all over in a tremble, an\' my \'ead, oo, my \'ead does feel\r\nbad!\'\r\n\r\n\'I know wot yer want,\' remarked Mrs. Kemp, nodding her head, \'an\' it so\r\n\'appens as I\'ve got the very thing with me.\' She pulled a medicine\r\nbottle out of her pocket, and taking out the cork smelt it. \'Thet\'s\r\ngood stuff, none of your firewater or your methylated spirit. I don\'t\r\noften indulge in sich things, but when I do I likes to \'ave the best.\'\r\n\r\nShe handed the bottle to Liza, who took a mouthful and gave it her\r\nback; she had a drink herself, and smacked her lips.\r\n\r\nThet\'s good stuff. \'Ave a drop more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na,\' said Liza, \'I ain\'t used ter drinkin\' spirits.\'\r\n\r\nShe felt dull and miserable, and a heavy pain throbbed through her\r\nhead. If she could only forget!\r\n\r\n\'Na, I know you\'re not, but, bless your soul, thet won\' \'urt yer.\r\nIt\'ll do you no end of good. Why, often when I\'ve been feelin\' thet\r\ndone up thet I didn\'t know wot ter do with myself, I\'ve just \'ad a\r\nlittle drop of whisky or gin--I\'m not partic\'ler wot spirit it is--an\'\r\nit\'s pulled me up wonderful.\'\r\n\r\nLiza took another sip, a slightly longer one; it burnt as it went down\r\nher throat, and sent through her a feeling of comfortable warmth.\r\n\r\n\'I really do think it\'s doin\' me good,\' she said, wiping her eyes and\r\ngiving a sigh of relief as the crying ceased.\r\n\r\n\'I knew it would. Tike my word for it, if people took a little drop of\r\nspirits in time, there\'d be much less sickness abaht.\'\r\n\r\nThey sat for a while in silence, then Mrs. Kemp remarked:\r\n\r\n\'Yer know, Liza, it strikes me as \'ow we could do with a drop more.\r\nYou not bein\' in the \'abit of tikin\' anythin\' I only brought just this\r\nlittle drop for me; an\' it ain\'t took us long ter finish thet up. But\r\nas you\'re an invalid like we\'ll git a little more this time; it\'s sure\r\nter turn aht useful.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you ain\'t got nothin\' ter put it in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I \'ave,\' answered Mrs. Kemp; \'there\'s thet bottle as they gives\r\nme at the \'orspital. Just empty the medicine aht into the pile, an\'\r\nwash it aht, an\' I\'ll tike it round to the pub myself.\'\r\n\r\nLiza, when she was left alone, began to turn things over in her mind.\r\nShe did not feel so utterly unhappy as before, for the things she had\r\ngone through seemed further away.\r\n\r\n\'After all,\' she said, \'it don\'t so much matter.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp came in.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ave a little drop more, Liza.\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t mind if I do. I\'ll get some tumblers, shall I? There\'s\r\nno mistike abaht it,\' she added, when she had taken a little, \'it do\r\nbuck yer up.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re right, Liza--you\'re right. An\' you wanted it badly. Fancy you\r\n\'avin\' a fight with a woman! Oh, I\'ve \'ad some in my day, but then I\r\nwasn\'t a little bit of a thing like you is. I wish I\'d been there, I\r\nwouldn\'t \'ave stood by an\' looked on while my daughter was gettin\' the\r\nworst of it; although I\'m turned sixty-five, an\' gettin\' on for\r\nsixty-six, I\'d \'ave said to \'er: "If you touch my daughter you\'ll \'ave\r\nme ter deal with, so just look aht!"\'\r\n\r\nShe brandished her glass, and that reminding her, she refilled it and\r\nLiza\'s.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, Liza,\' she remarked, \'you\'re a chip of the old block. Ter see you\r\nsettin\' there an\' \'avin\' your little drop, it mikes me feel as if I\r\nwas livin\' a better life. Yer used ter be rather \'ard on me, Liza,\r\n\'cause I took a little drop on Saturday nights. An\', mind, I don\'t sy\r\nI didn\'t tike a little drop too much sometimes--accidents will occur\r\neven in the best regulated of families, but wot I say is this--it\'s\r\ngood stuff, I say, an\' it don\'t \'urt yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Buck up, old gal!\' said Liza, filling the glasses, \'no \'eel-taps. I\r\nfeel like a new woman now. I was thet dahn in the dumps--well, I\r\nshouldn\'t \'ave cared if I\'d been at the bottom of the river, an\'\r\nthet\'s the truth.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t sy so,\' replied her affectionate mother.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, I do, an\' I mean it too, but I don\'t feel like thet now. You\'re\r\nright, mother, when you\'re in trouble there\'s nothin\' like a bit of\r\nspirits.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, if I don\'t know, I dunno \'oo does, for the trouble I\'ve \'ad, it\r\n\'ud be enough to kill many women. Well, I\'ve \'ad thirteen children,\r\nan\' you can think wot thet was; everyone I \'ad I used ter sy I\r\nwouldn\'t \'ave no more--but one does, yer know. You\'ll \'ave a family\r\nsome day, Liza, an\' I shouldn\'t wonder if you didn\'t \'ave as many as\r\nme. We come from a very prodigal family, we do, we\'ve all gone in ter\r\ndouble figures, except your Aunt Mary, who only \'ad three--but then\r\nshe wasn\'t married, so it didn\'t count, like.\'\r\n\r\nThey drank each other\'s health. Everything was getting blurred to\r\nLiza, she was losing her head.\r\n\r\n\'Yus,\' went on Mrs. Kemp, \'I\'ve \'ad thirteen children an\' I\'m proud of\r\nit. As your poor dear father used ter sy, it shows as \'ow one\'s got\r\nthe blood of a Briton in one. Your poor dear father, \'e was a great\r\n\'and at speakin\' \'e was: \'e used ter speak at parliamentary\r\nmeetin\'s--I really believe \'e\'d \'ave been a Member of Parliament if\r\n\'e\'d been alive now. Well, as I was sayin\', your father \'e used ter\r\nsy, "None of your small families for me, I don\'t approve of them,"\r\nsays \'e. \'E was a man of very \'igh principles, an\' by politics \'e was\r\na Radical. "No," says \'e, when \'e got talkin\', "when a man can \'ave a\r\nfamily risin\' into double figures, it shows \'e\'s got the backbone of a\r\nBriton in \'im. That\'s the stuff as \'as built up England\'s nime and\r\nglory! When one thinks of the mighty British Hempire," says \'e, "on\r\nwhich the sun never sets from mornin\' till night, one \'as ter be proud\r\nof \'isself, an\' one \'as ter do one\'s duty in thet walk of life in\r\nwhich it \'as pleased Providence ter set one--an\' every man\'s fust duty\r\nis ter get as many children as \'e bloomin\' well can." Lord love\r\nyer--\'e could talk, I can tell yer.\'\r\n\r\n\'Drink up, mother,\' said Liza. \'You\'re not \'alf drinkin\'.\' She\r\nflourished the bottle. \'I don\'t care a twopanny \'ang for all them\r\nblokes; I\'m quite \'appy, an\' I don\'t want anythin\' else.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can see you\'re my daughter now,\' said Mrs. Kemp. \'When yer used ter\r\nround on me I used ter think as \'ow if I \'adn\'t carried yer for nine\r\nmonths, it must \'ave been some mistike, an\' yer wasn\'t my daughter at\r\nall. When you come ter think of it, a man \'e don\'t know if it\'s \'is\r\nchild or somebody else\'s, but yer can\'t deceive a woman like thet. Yer\r\ncouldn\'t palm off somebody else\'s kid on \'er.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am beginnin\' ter feel quite lively,\' said Liza. \'I dunno wot it is,\r\nbut I feel as if I wanted to laugh till I fairly split my sides.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she began to sing: \'For \'e\'s a jolly good feller--for \'e\'s a jolly\r\ngood feller!\'\r\n\r\nHer dress was all disarranged; her face covered with the scars of\r\nscratches, and clots of blood had fixed under her nose; her eye had\r\nswollen up so that it was nearly closed, and red; her hair was hanging\r\nover her face and shoulders, and she laughed stupidly and leered with\r\nheavy, sodden ugliness.\r\n\r\n    \'Disy, Disy! I can\'t afford a kerridge.\r\n     But you\'ll look neat, on the seat\r\n       Of a bicycle mide for two.\'\r\n\r\nShe shouted out the tunes, beating time on the table, and her mother,\r\ngrinning, with her thin, grey hair hanging dishevelled over her head,\r\njoined in with her weak, cracked voice--\r\n\r\n    \'Oh, dem golden kippers, oh!\'\r\n\r\nThen Liza grew more melancholy and broke into \'Auld Lang Syne\'.\r\n\r\n    \'Should old acquaintance be forgot\r\n       And never brought to mind?\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       For old lang syne\'.\r\n\r\nFinally they both grew silent, and in a little while there came a\r\nsnore from Mrs. Kemp; her head fell forward to her chest; Liza tumbled\r\nfrom her chair on to the bed, and sprawling across it fell asleep.\r\n\r\n    \'_Although I am drunk and bad, be you kind,\r\n    Cast a glance at this heart which is bewildered and distressed.\r\n    O God, take away from my mind my cry and my complaint.\r\n    Offer wine, and take sorrow from my remembrance.\r\n    Offer wine._\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the night Liza woke; her mouth was hot and dry,\r\nand a sharp, cutting pain passed through her head as she moved. Her\r\nmother had evidently roused herself, for she was lying in bed by her\r\nside, partially undressed, with all the bedclothes rolled round her.\r\nLiza shivered in the cold night, and taking off some of her\r\nthings--her boots, her skirt, and jacket--got right into bed; she\r\ntried to get some of the blanket from her mother, but as she pulled\r\nMrs. Kemp gave a growl in her sleep and drew the clothes more tightly\r\nround her. So Liza put over herself her skirt and a shawl, which was\r\nlying over the end of the bed, and tried to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut she could not; her head and hands were broiling hot, and she was\r\nterribly thirsty; when she lifted herself up to get a drink of water\r\nsuch a pang went through her head that she fell back on the bed\r\ngroaning, and lay there with beating heart. And strange pains that she\r\ndid not know went through her. Then a cold shiver seemed to rise in\r\nthe very marrow of her bones and run down every artery and vein,\r\nfreezing the blood; her skin puckered up, and drawing up her legs she\r\nlay huddled together in a heap, the shawl wrapped tightly round her,\r\nand her teeth chattering. Shivering, she whispered:\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m so cold, so cold. Mother, give me some clothes; I shall die\r\nof the cold. Oh, I\'m freezing!\'\r\n\r\nBut after awhile the cold seemed to give way, and a sudden heat seized\r\nher, flushing her face, making her break out into perspiration, so\r\nthat she threw everything off and loosened the things about her neck.\r\n\r\n\'Give us a drink,\' she said. \'Oh, I\'d give anythin\' for a little drop\r\nof water!\'\r\n\r\nThere was no one to hear; Mrs. Kemp continued to sleep heavily,\r\noccasionally breaking out into a little snore.\r\n\r\nLiza remained there, now shivering with cold, now panting for breath,\r\nlistening to the regular, heavy breathing by her side, and in her pain\r\nshe sobbed. She pulled at her pillow and said:\r\n\r\n\'Why can\'t I go to sleep? Why can\'t I sleep like \'er?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the darkness was awful; it was a heavy, ghastly blackness, that\r\nseemed palpable, so that it frightened her and she looked for relief\r\nat the faint light glimmering through the window from a distant\r\nstreet-lamp. She thought the night would never end--the minutes seemed\r\nlike hours, and she wondered how she should live through till morning.\r\nAnd strange pains that she did not know went through her.\r\n\r\nStill the night went on, the darkness continued, cold and horrible,\r\nand her mother breathed loudly and steadily by her side.\r\n\r\nAt last with the morning sleep came; but the sleep was almost worse\r\nthan the wakefulness, for it was accompanied by ugly, disturbing\r\ndreams. Liza thought she was going through the fight with her enemy,\r\nand Mrs. Blakeston grew enormous in size, and multiplied, so that every\r\nway she turned the figure confronted her. And she began running away,\r\nand she ran and ran till she found herself reckoning up an account she\r\nhad puzzled over in the morning, and she did it backwards and\r\nforwards, upwards and downwards, starting here, starting there, and\r\nthe figures got mixed up with other things, and she had to begin over\r\nagain, and everything jumbled up, and her head whirled, till finally,\r\nwith a start, she woke.\r\n\r\nThe darkness had given way to a cold, grey dawn, her uncovered legs\r\nwere chilled to the bone, and by her side she heard again the regular,\r\nnasal breathing of the drunkard.\r\n\r\nFor a long while she lay where she was, feeling very sick and ill, but\r\nbetter than in the night. At last her mother woke.\r\n\r\n\'Liza!\' she called.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, mother,\' she answered feebly.\r\n\r\n\'Git us a cup of tea, will yer?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t, mother, I\'m ill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Garn!\' said Mrs. Kemp, in surprise. Then looking at her: \'Swop me bob,\r\nwot\'s up with yer? Why, yer cheeks is flushed, an\' yer forehead--it is\r\n\'ot! Wot\'s the matter with yer, gal?\'\r\n\r\n\'I dunno,\' said Liza. \'I\'ve been thet bad all night, I thought I was\r\ngoin\' ter die.\'\r\n\r\n\'I know wot it is,\' said Mrs. Kemp, shaking her head; \'the fact is, you\r\nain\'t used ter drinkin\', an\' of course it\'s upset yer. Now me, why I\'m\r\nas fresh as a disy. Tike my word, there ain\'t no good in teetotalism;\r\nit finds yer aht in the end, an\' it\'s found you aht.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp considered it a judgment of Providence. She got up and mixed\r\nsome whisky and water.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ere, drink this,\' she said. \'When one\'s \'ad a drop too much at\r\nnight, there\'s nothin\' like havin\' a drop more in the mornin\' ter put\r\none right. It just acts like magic.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tike it awy,\' said Liza, turning from it in disgust; \'the smell of it\r\ngives me the sick. I\'ll never touch spirits again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, thet\'s wot we all says sometime in our lives, but we does, an\'\r\nwot\'s more we can\'t do withaht it. Why, me, the \'ard life I\'ve \'ad--.\'\r\nIt is unnecessary to repeat Mrs. Kemp\'s repetitions.\r\n\r\nLiza did not get up all day. Tom came to inquire after her, and was\r\ntold she was very ill. Liza plaintively asked whether anyone else had\r\nbeen, and sighed a little when her mother answered no. But she felt\r\ntoo ill to think much or trouble much about anything. The fever came\r\nagain as the day wore on, and the pains in her head grew worse. Her\r\nmother came to bed, and quickly went off to sleep, leaving Liza to\r\nbear her agony alone. She began to have frightful pains all over her,\r\nand she held her breath to prevent herself from crying out and waking\r\nher mother. She clutched the sheets in her agony, and at last, about\r\nsix o\'clock in the morning, she could bear it no longer, and in the\r\nanguish of labour screamed out, and woke her mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp was frightened out of her wits. Going upstairs she woke the\r\nwoman who lived on the floor above her. Without hesitating, the good\r\nlady put on a skirt and came down.\r\n\r\n\'She\'s \'ad a miss,\' she said, after looking at Liza. \'Is there anyone\r\nyou could send to the \'orspital?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, I dunno \'oo I could get at this hour?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll git my old man ter go.\'\r\n\r\nShe called her husband, and sent him off. She was a stout, middle-aged\r\nwoman, rough-visaged and strong-armed. Her name was Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s lucky you came ter me,\' she said, when she had settled down. \'I\r\ngo aht nursin\', yer know, so I know all abaht it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you surprise me,\' said Mrs. Kemp. \'I didn\'t know as Liza was\r\nthet way. She never told me nothin\' abaht it.\'\r\n\r\n\'D\'yer know \'oo it is \'as done it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Now you ask me somethin\' I don\'t know,\' replied Mrs. Kemp. \'But now I\r\ncome ter think of it, it must be thet there Tom. \'E\'s been keepin\'\r\ncompany with Liza. \'E\'s a single man, so they\'ll be able ter get\r\nmarried--thet\'s somethin\'.\'\r\n\r\n\'It ain\'t Tom,\' feebly said Liza.\r\n\r\n\'Not \'im; \'oo is it, then?\'\r\n\r\nLiza did not answer.\r\n\r\n\'Eh?\' repeated the mother, \'\'oo is it?\'\r\n\r\nLiza lay still without speaking.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Mrs. Kemp,\' said Mrs. Hodges, \'don\'t worry \'er now; you\'ll\r\nbe able ter find aht all abaht it when she gits better.\'\r\n\r\nFor a while the two women sat still, waiting the doctor\'s coming, and\r\nLiza lay gazing vacantly at the wall, panting for breath. Sometimes\r\nJim crossed her mind, and she opened her mouth to call for him, but in\r\nher despair she restrained herself.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came.\r\n\r\n\'D\'you think she\'s bad, doctor?\' asked Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid she is rather,\' he answered. \'I\'ll come in again this\r\nevening.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, doctor,\' said Mrs. Kemp, as he was going, \'could yer give me\r\nsomethin\' for my rheumatics? I\'m a martyr to rheumatism, an\' these\r\ncold days I \'ardly knows wot ter do with myself. An\', doctor, could\r\nyou let me \'ave some beef-tea? My \'usbind\'s dead, an\' of course I\r\ncan\'t do no work with my daughter ill like this, an\' we\'re very\r\nshort--.\'\r\n\r\nThe day passed, and in the evening Mrs. Hodges, who had been attending\r\nto her own domestic duties, came downstairs again. Mrs. Kemp was on the\r\nbed sleeping.\r\n\r\n\'I was just \'avin\' a little nap,\' she said to Mrs. Hodges, on waking.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow is the girl?\' asked that lady.\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' answered Mrs. Kemp, \'my rheumatics \'as been thet bad I really\r\n\'aven\'t known wot ter do with myself, an\' now Liza can\'t rub me I\'m\r\nworse than ever. It is unfortunate thet she should get ill just now\r\nwhen I want so much attendin\' ter myself, but there, it\'s just my\r\nluck!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hodges went over and looked at Liza; she was lying just as when\r\nshe left in the morning, her cheeks flushed, her mouth open for\r\nbreath, and tiny beads of sweat stood on her forehead.\r\n\r\n\'\'Ow are yer, ducky?\' asked Mrs. Hodges; but Liza did not answer.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s my belief she\'s unconscious,\' said Mrs. Kemp. \'I\'ve been askin\'\r\n\'er \'oo it was as done it, but she don\'t seem to \'ear wot I say. It\'s\r\nbeen a great shock ter me, Mrs. \'Odges.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe you,\' replied that lady, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\'Well, when you come in and said wot it was, yer might \'ave knocked\r\nme dahn with a feather. I knew no more than the dead wot \'ad\r\n\'appened.\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw at once wot it was,\' said Mrs. Hodges, nodding her head.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, of course, you knew. I expect you\'ve \'ad a great deal of\r\npractice one way an\' another.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re right, Mrs. Kemp, you\'re right. I\'ve been on the job now for\r\nnearly twenty years, an\' if I don\'t know somethin\' abaht it I ought.\'\r\n\r\n\'D\'yer finds it pays well?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mrs. Kemp, tike it all in all, I ain\'t got no grounds for\r\ncomplaint. I\'m in the \'abit of askin\' five shillings, an\' I will say\r\nthis, I don\'t think it\'s too much for wot I do.\'\r\n\r\nThe news of Liza\'s illness had quickly spread, and more than once in\r\nthe course of the day a neighbour had come to ask after her. There was\r\na knock at the door now, and Mrs. Hodges opened it. Tom stood on the\r\nthreshold asking to come in.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, you can come,\' said Mrs. Kemp.\r\n\r\nHe advanced on tiptoe, so as to make no noise, and for a while stood\r\nsilently looking at Liza. Mrs. Hodges was by his side.\r\n\r\n\'Can I speak to \'er?\' he whispered.\r\n\r\n\'She can\'t \'ear you.\'\r\n\r\nHe groaned.\r\n\r\n\'D\'yer think she\'ll get arright?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hodges shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\'I shouldn\'t like ter give an opinion,\' she said, cautiously.\r\n\r\nTom bent over Liza, and, blushing, kissed her; then, without speaking\r\nfurther, went out of the room.\r\n\r\n\'Thet\'s the young man as was courtin\' \'er,\' said Mrs. Kemp, pointing\r\nover her shoulder with her thumb.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Doctor came.\r\n\r\n\'Wot do yer think of \'er, doctor?\' said Mrs. Hodges, bustling forwards\r\nauthoritatively in her position of midwife and sick-nurse.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid she\'s very bad.\'\r\n\r\n\'D\'yer think she\'s goin\' ter die?\' she asked, dropping her voice to a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m afraid so!\'\r\n\r\nAs the doctor sat down by Liza\'s side Mrs. Hodges turned round and\r\nsignificantly nodded to Mrs. Kemp, who put her handkerchief to her\r\neyes. Then she went outside to the little group waiting at the door.\r\n\r\n\'Wot does the doctor sy?\' they asked, among them Tom.\r\n\r\n\'\'E says just wot I\'ve been sayin\' all along; I knew she wouldn\'t\r\nlive.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Tom burst out: \'Oh, Liza!\'\r\n\r\nAs she retired a woman remarked:\r\n\r\n\'Mrs. \'Odges is very clever, I think.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yus,\' remarked another, \'she got me through my last confinement\r\nsimply wonderful. If it come to choosin\' between \'em I\'d back Mrs.\r\n\'Odges against forty doctors.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ter tell yer the truth, so would I. I\'ve never known \'er wrong yet.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hodges sat down beside Mrs. Kemp and proceeded to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\'Why don\'t yer tike a little drop of brandy ter calm yer nerves, Mrs.\r\nKemp?\' she said, \'you want it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was just feelin\' rather faint, an\' I couldn\'t \'elp thinkin\' as \'ow\r\ntwopenneth of whisky \'ud do me good.\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, Mrs. Kemp,\' said Mrs. Hodges, earnestly, putting her hand on the\r\nother\'s arm. \'You tike my tip--when you\'re queer there\'s nothin\' like\r\nbrandy for pullin\' yer togither. I don\'t object to whisky myself, but\r\nas a medicine yer can\'t beat brandy.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I won\'t set up myself as knowin\' better than you Mrs. \'Odges;\r\nI\'ll do wot you think right.\'\r\n\r\nQuite accidentally there was some in the room, and Mrs. Kemp poured it\r\nout for herself and her friend.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not in the \'abit of tikin\' anythin\' when I\'m aht on business,\'\r\nshe apologized, \'but just ter keep you company I don\'t mind if I do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your \'ealth. Mrs. \'Odges.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sime ter you, an\' thank yer, Mrs. Kemp.\'\r\n\r\nLiza lay still, breathing very quietly, her eyes closed. The doctor\r\nkept his fingers on her pulse.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been very unfortunate of lite,\' remarked Mrs. Hodges, as she\r\nlicked her lips, \'this mikes the second death I\'ve \'ad in the last ten\r\ndays--women, I mean, of course I don\'t count bibies.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yer don\'t sy so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course the other one--well, she was only a prostitute, so it\r\ndidn\'t so much matter. It ain\'t like another woman is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Na, you\'re right.\'\r\n\r\n\'Still, one don\'t like \'em ter die, even if they are thet. One mustn\'t\r\nbe too \'ard on \'em.\'\r\n\r\n\'Strikes me you\'ve got a very kind \'eart, Mrs. \'Odges,\' said Mrs. Kemp.\r\n\r\n\'I \'ave thet; an\' I often says it \'ud be better for my peace of mind\r\nan\' my business if I \'adn\'t. I \'ave ter go through a lot, I do; but I\r\ncan say this for myself, I always gives satisfaction, an\' thet\'s\r\nsomethin\' as all lidies in my line can\'t say.\'\r\n\r\nThey sipped their brandy for a while.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a great trial ter me that this should \'ave \'appened,\' said Mrs.\r\nKemp, coming to the subject that had been disturbing her for some\r\ntime. \'Mine\'s always been a very respectable family, an\' such a thing\r\nas this \'as never \'appened before. No, Mrs. \'Odges, I was lawfully\r\nmarried in church, an\' I\'ve got my marriage lines now ter show I was,\r\nan\' thet one of my daughters should \'ave gone wrong in this way--well,\r\nI can\'t understand it. I give \'er a good education, an\' she \'ad all\r\nthe comforts of a \'ome. She never wanted for nothin\'; I worked myself\r\nto the bone ter keep \'er in luxury, an\' then thet she should go an\'\r\ndisgrace me like this!\'\r\n\r\n\'I understand wot yer mean. Mrs. Kemp.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can tell you my family was very respectable; an\' my \'usband, \'e\r\nearned twenty-five shillings a week, an\' was in the sime plice\r\nseventeen years; an\' \'is employers sent a beautiful wreath ter put on\r\n\'is coffin; an\' they tell me they never \'ad such a good workman an\'\r\nsich an \'onest man before. An\' me! Well, I can sy this--I\'ve done my\r\nduty by the girl, an\' she\'s never learnt anythin\' but good from me. Of\r\ncourse I ain\'t always been in wot yer might call flourishing\r\ncircumstances, but I\'ve always set her a good example, as she could\r\ntell yer so \'erself if she wasn\'t speechless.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Kemp paused for a moment\'s reflection.\r\n\r\n\'As they sy in the Bible,\' she finished, \'it\'s enough ter mike one\'s\r\ngrey \'airs go dahn into the ground in sorrer. I can show yer my\r\nmarriage certificate. Of course one doesn\'t like ter say much, because\r\nof course she\'s very bad; but if she got well I should \'ave given \'er\r\na talkin\' ter.\'\r\n\r\nThere was another knock.\r\n\r\n\'Do go an\' see \'oo thet is; I can\'t, on account of my rheumatics.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hodges opened the door. It was Jim.\r\n\r\nHe was very white, and the blackness of his hair and beard,\r\ncontrasting with the deathly pallor of his face, made him look\r\nghastly. Mrs. Hodges stepped back.\r\n\r\n\'\'Oo\'s \'e?\' she said, turning to Mrs. Kemp.\r\n\r\nJim pushed her aside and went up to the bed.\r\n\r\n\'Doctor, is she very bad?\' he asked.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at him questioningly.\r\n\r\nJim whispered: \'It was me as done it. She ain\'t goin\' ter die, is\r\nshe?\'\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded.\r\n\r\n\'O God! wot shall I do? It was my fault! I wish I was dead!\'\r\n\r\nJim took the girl\'s head in his hands, and the tears burst from his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\'She ain\'t dead yet, is she?\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s just living,\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\nJim bent down.\r\n\r\n\'Liza, Liza, speak ter me! Liza, say you forgive me! Oh, speak ter\r\nme!\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was full of agony. The doctor spoke.\r\n\r\n\'She can\'t hear you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, she must hear me! Liza! Liza!\'\r\n\r\nHe sank on his knees by the bedside.\r\n\r\nThey all remained silent: Liza lying stiller than ever, her breast\r\nunmoved by the feeble respiration, Jim looking at her very mournfully;\r\nthe doctor grave, with his fingers on the pulse. The two women looked\r\nat Jim.\r\n\r\n\'Fancy it bein\' \'im!\' said Mrs. Kemp. \'Strike me lucky, ain\'t \'e a\r\nsight!\'\r\n\r\n\'You \'ave got \'er insured, Mrs. Kemp?\' asked the midwife. She could\r\nbear the silence no longer.\r\n\r\n\'Trust me fur thet!\' replied the good lady. \'I\'ve \'ad \'er insured ever\r\nsince she was born. Why, only the other dy I was sayin\' ter myself\r\nthet all thet money \'ad been wisted, but you see it wasn\'t; yer never\r\nknow yer luck, you see!\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite right, Mrs. Kemp; I\'m a rare one for insurin\'. It\'s a great\r\nthing. I\'ve always insured all my children.\'\r\n\r\n\'The way I look on it is this,\' said Mrs. Kemp--\'wotever yer do when\r\nthey\'re alive, an\' we all know as children is very tryin\' sometimes,\r\nyou should give them a good funeral when they dies. Thet\'s my motto,\r\nan\' I\'ve always acted up to it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you deal with Mr. Stearman?\' asked Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\'No, Mrs. \'Odges, for undertikin\' give me Mr. Footley every time. In the\r\nblack line \'e\'s fust an\' the rest nowhere!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, thet\'s very strange now--thet\'s just wot I think. Mr. Footley\r\ndoes \'is work well, an\' \'e\'s very reasonable. I\'m a very old customer\r\nof \'is, an\' \'e lets me \'ave things as cheap as anybody.\'\r\n\r\n\'Does \'e indeed! Well Mrs. \'Odges if it ain\'t askin\' too much of yer, I\r\nshould look upon it as very kind if you\'d go an\' mike the arrangements\r\nfor Liza.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, certainly, Mrs. Kemp. I\'m always willin\' ter do a good turn to\r\nanybody, if I can.\'\r\n\r\n\'I want it done very respectable,\' said Mrs. Kemp; \'I\'m not goin\' ter\r\nstint for nothin\' for my daughter\'s funeral. I like plumes, you know,\r\nalthough they is a bit extra.\'\r\n\r\n\'Never you fear, Mrs. Kemp, it shall be done as well as if it was for\r\nmy own \'usbind, an\' I can\'t say more than thet. Mr. Footley thinks a\r\ndeal of me, \'e does! Why, only the other dy as I was goin\' inter \'is\r\nshop \'e says "Good mornin\', Mrs. \'Odges." "Good mornin\', Mr. Footley,"\r\nsays I. "You\'ve jest come in the nick of time," says \'e. "This\r\ngentleman an\' myself," pointin\' to another gentleman as was standin\'\r\nthere, "we was \'avin\' a bit of an argument. Now you\'re a very\r\nintelligent woman, Mrs. \'Odges, and a good customer too." "I can say\r\nthet for myself," say I, "I gives yer all the work I can." "I believe\r\nyou," says \'e. "Well," \'e says, "now which do you think? Does hoak\r\nlook better than helm, or does helm look better than hoak? Hoak\r\n_versus_ helm, thet\'s the question." "Well, Mr. Footley," says I, "for\r\nmy own private opinion, when you\'ve got a nice brass plite in the\r\nmiddle, an\' nice brass \'andles each end, there\'s nothin\' like hoak."\r\n"Quite right," says \'e, "thet\'s wot I think; for coffins give me hoak\r\nany day, an\' I \'ope," says \'e, "when the Lord sees fit ter call me to\r\n\'Imself, I shall be put in a hoak coffin myself." "Amen," says I.\'\r\n\r\n\'I like hoak,\' said Mrs. Kemp. \'My poor \'usband \'e \'ad a hoak coffin.\r\nWe did \'ave a job with \'im, I can tell yer. You know \'e \'ad dropsy,\r\nan\' \'e swell up--oh, \'e did swell; \'is own mother wouldn\'t \'ave known\r\n\'im. Why, \'is leg swell up till it was as big round as \'is body, swop\r\nme bob, it did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did it indeed!\' ejaculated Mrs. Hodges.\r\n\r\n\'Yus, an\' when \'e died they sent the coffin up. I didn\'t \'ave Mr.\r\nFootley at thet time; we didn\'t live \'ere then, we lived in Battersea,\r\nan\' all our undertikin\' was done by Mr. Brownin\'; well, \'e sent the\r\ncoffin up, an\' we got my old man in, but we couldn\'t get the lid down,\r\nhe was so swell up. Well, Mr. Brownin\', \'e was a great big man,\r\nthirteen stone if \'e was a ounce. Well, \'e stood on the coffin, an\' a\r\nyoung man \'e \'ad with \'im stood on it too, an\' the lid simply wouldn\'t\r\ngo dahn; so Mr. Browning\', \'e said, "Jump on, missus," so I was in my\r\nwidow\'s weeds, yer know, but we \'ad ter git it dahn, so I stood on it,\r\nan\' we all jumped, an\' at last we got it to, an\' screwed it; but,\r\nlor\', we did \'ave a job; I shall never forget it.\'\r\n\r\nThen all was silence. And a heaviness seemed to fill the air like a\r\ngrey blight, cold and suffocating; and the heaviness was Death. They\r\nfelt the presence in the room, and they dared not move, they dared not\r\ndraw their breath. The silence was terrifying.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a sound was heard--a loud rattle. It was from the bed and\r\nrang through the room, piercing the stillness.\r\n\r\nThe doctor opened one of Liza\'s eyes and touched it, then he laid on\r\nher breast the hand he had been holding, and drew the sheet over her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nJim turned away with a look of intense weariness on his face, and the\r\ntwo women began weeping silently. The darkness was sinking before the\r\nday, and a dim, grey light came through the window. The lamp\r\nspluttered out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Liza of Lambeth, by W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n\r\n'
