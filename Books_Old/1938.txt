A writer of world-wide reputation should be\r\nat least allowed to know how to spell his own name. Why should any one\r\ninsist on spelling it "Tolstoi" (with one, two or three dots over the\r\n"i"), when he himself writes it "Tolstoy"? The only reason I have ever\r\nheard suggested is, that in England and America such outlandish views\r\nare attributed to him, that an outlandish spelling is desirable to match\r\nthose views.\r\n\r\nThis novel, written in the rough by Tolstoy some years ago and founded\r\nupon an actual occurrence, was completely rewritten by him during the\r\nlast year and a half, and all the proceeds have been devoted by him\r\nto aiding the Doukhobors, a sect who were persecuted in the Caucasus\r\n(especially from 1895 to 1898) for refusing to learn war. About seven\r\nthousand three hundred of them are settled in Canada, and about a\r\nhundred of the leaders are exiled to the remote parts of Siberia.\r\n\r\nAnything I may receive for my work in translating the book will go to\r\nthe same cause. "Prevention is better than cure," and I would rather\r\nhelp people to abstain from killing and wounding each other than devote\r\nthe money to patch up their wounds after the battle.\r\n\r\nLOUISE MAUDE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESURRECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA IN PRISON.\r\n\r\nThough hundreds of thousands had done their very best to disfigure the\r\nsmall piece of land on which they were crowded together, by paving the\r\nground with stones, scraping away every vestige of vegetation, cutting\r\ndown the trees, turning away birds and beasts, and filling the air with\r\nthe smoke of naphtha and coal, still spring was spring, even in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone warm, the air was balmy; everywhere, where it did not get\r\nscraped away, the grass revived and sprang up between the paving-stones\r\nas well as on the narrow strips of lawn on the boulevards. The birches,\r\nthe poplars, and the wild cherry unfolded their gummy and fragrant\r\nleaves, the limes were expanding their opening buds; crows, sparrows,\r\nand pigeons, filled with the joy of spring, were getting their nests\r\nready; the flies were buzzing along the walls, warmed by the sunshine.\r\nAll were glad, the plants, the birds, the insects, and the children. But\r\nmen, grown-up men and women, did not leave off cheating and tormenting\r\nthemselves and each other. It was not this spring morning men thought\r\nsacred and worthy of consideration not the beauty of God\'s world, given\r\nfor a joy to all creatures, this beauty which inclines the heart to\r\npeace, to harmony, and to love, but only their own devices for enslaving\r\none another.\r\n\r\nThus, in the prison office of the Government town, it was not the fact\r\nthat men and animals had received the grace and gladness of spring that\r\nwas considered sacred and important, but that a notice, numbered and\r\nwith a superscription, had come the day before, ordering that on this\r\n28th day of April, at 9 a.m., three prisoners at present detained in the\r\nprison, a man and two women (one of these women, as the chief criminal,\r\nto be conducted separately), had to appear at Court. So now, on the 28th\r\nof April, at 8 o\'clock, a jailer and soon after him a woman warder with\r\ncurly grey hair, dressed in a jacket with sleeves trimmed with gold,\r\nwith a blue-edged belt round her waist, and having a look of suffering\r\non her face, came into the corridor.\r\n\r\n"You want Maslova?" she asked, coming up to the cell with the jailer who\r\nwas on duty.\r\n\r\nThe jailer, rattling the iron padlock, opened the door of the cell, from\r\nwhich there came a whiff of air fouler even than that in the corridor,\r\nand called out, "Maslova! to the Court," and closed the door again.\r\n\r\nEven into the prison yard the breeze had brought the fresh vivifying air\r\nfrom the fields. But in the corridor the air was laden with the germs of\r\ntyphoid, the smell of sewage, putrefaction, and tar; every newcomer felt\r\nsad and dejected in it. The woman warder felt this, though she was\r\nused to bad air. She had just come in from outside, and entering the\r\ncorridor, she at once became sleepy.\r\n\r\nFrom inside the cell came the sound of bustle and women\'s voices, and\r\nthe patter of bare feet on the floor.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, hurry up, Maslova, I say!" called out the jailer, and in a\r\nminute or two a small young woman with a very full bust came briskly out\r\nof the door and went up to the jailer. She had on a grey cloak over a\r\nwhite jacket and petticoat. On her feet she wore linen stockings and\r\nprison shoes, and round her head was tied a white kerchief, from under\r\nwhich a few locks of black hair were brushed over the forehead with\r\nevident intent. The face of the woman was of that whiteness peculiar to\r\npeople who have lived long in confinement, and which puts one in mind of\r\nshoots of potatoes that spring up in a cellar. Her small broad hands and\r\nfull neck, which showed from under the broad collar of her cloak, were\r\nof the same hue. Her black, sparkling eyes, one with a slight squint,\r\nappeared in striking contrast to the dull pallor of her face.\r\n\r\nShe carried herself very straight, expanding her full bosom.\r\n\r\nWith her head slightly thrown back, she stood in the corridor, looking\r\nstraight into the eyes of the jailer, ready to comply with any order.\r\n\r\nThe jailer was about to lock the door when a wrinkled and severe-looking\r\nold woman put out her grey head and began speaking to Maslova. But the\r\njailer closed the door, pushing the old woman\'s head with it. A woman\'s\r\nlaughter was heard from the cell, and Maslova smiled, turning to the\r\nlittle grated opening in the cell door. The old woman pressed her face\r\nto the grating from the other side, and said, in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n"Now mind, and when they begin questioning you, just repeat over the\r\nsame thing, and stick to it; tell nothing that is not wanted."\r\n\r\n"Well, it could not be worse than it is now, anyhow; I only wish it was\r\nsettled one way or another."\r\n\r\n"Of course, it will be settled one way or another," said the jailer,\r\nwith a superior\'s self-assured witticism. "Now, then, get along! Take\r\nyour places!"\r\n\r\nThe old woman\'s eyes vanished from the grating, and Maslova stepped out\r\ninto the middle of the corridor. The warder in front, they descended\r\nthe stone stairs, past the still fouler, noisy cells of the men\'s\r\nward, where they were followed by eyes looking out of every one of the\r\ngratings in the doors, and entered the office, where two soldiers were\r\nwaiting to escort her. A clerk who was sitting there gave one of the\r\nsoldiers a paper reeking of tobacco, and pointing to the prisoner,\r\nremarked, "Take her."\r\n\r\nThe soldier, a peasant from Nijni Novgorod, with a red, pock-marked\r\nface, put the paper into the sleeve of his coat, winked to his\r\ncompanion, a broad-shouldered Tchouvash, and then the prisoner and the\r\nsoldiers went to the front entrance, out of the prison yard, and through\r\nthe town up the middle of the roughly-paved street.\r\n\r\nIsvostchiks [cabmen], tradespeople, cooks, workmen, and government\r\nclerks, stopped and looked curiously at the prisoner; some shook their\r\nheads and thought, "This is what evil conduct, conduct unlike ours,\r\nleads to." The children stopped and gazed at the robber with frightened\r\nlooks; but the thought that the soldiers were preventing her from doing\r\nmore harm quieted their fears. A peasant, who had sold his charcoal, and\r\nhad had some tea in the town, came up, and, after crossing himself, gave\r\nher a copeck. The prisoner blushed and muttered something; she noticed\r\nthat she was attracting everybody\'s attention, and that pleased her. The\r\ncomparatively fresh air also gladdened her, but it was painful to step\r\non the rough stones with the ill-made prison shoes on her feet, which\r\nhad become unused to walking. Passing by a corn-dealer\'s shop, in front\r\nof which a few pigeons were strutting about, unmolested by any one, the\r\nprisoner almost touched a grey-blue bird with her foot; it fluttered up\r\nand flew close to her ear, fanning her with its wings. She smiled, then\r\nsighed deeply as she remembered her present position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA\'S EARLY LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe story of the prisoner Maslova\'s life was a very common one.\r\n\r\nMaslova\'s mother was the unmarried daughter of a village woman,\r\nemployed on a dairy farm, which belonged to two maiden ladies who were\r\nlandowners. This unmarried woman had a baby every year, and, as often\r\nhappens among the village people, each one of these undesired babies,\r\nafter it had been carefully baptised, was neglected by its mother, whom\r\nit hindered at her work, and left to starve. Five children had died in\r\nthis way. They had all been baptised and then not sufficiently fed, and\r\njust left to die. The sixth baby, whose father was a gipsy tramp, would\r\nhave shared the same fate, had it not so happened that one of the maiden\r\nladies came into the farmyard to scold the dairymaids for sending up\r\ncream that smelt of the cow. The young woman was lying in the cowshed\r\nwith a fine, healthy, new-born baby. The old maiden lady scolded the\r\nmaids again for allowing the woman (who had just been confined) to lie\r\nin the cowshed, and was about to go away, but seeing the baby her heart\r\nwas touched, and she offered to stand godmother to the little girl, and\r\npity for her little god-daughter induced her to give milk and a little\r\nmoney to the mother, so that she should feed the baby; and the little\r\ngirl lived. The old ladies spoke of her as "the saved one." When the\r\nchild was three years old, her mother fell ill and died, and the maiden\r\nladies took the child from her old grandmother, to whom she was nothing\r\nbut a burden.\r\n\r\nThe little black-eyed maiden grew to be extremely pretty, and so full of\r\nspirits that the ladies found her very entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe younger of the ladies, Sophia Ivanovna, who had stood godmother to\r\nthe girl, had the kinder heart of the two sisters; Maria Ivanovna, the\r\nelder, was rather hard. Sophia Ivanovna dressed the little girl in nice\r\nclothes, and taught her to read and write, meaning to educate her like a\r\nlady. Maria Ivanovna thought the child should be brought up to work, and\r\ntrained her to be a good servant. She was exacting; she punished, and,\r\nwhen in a bad temper, even struck the little girl. Growing up under\r\nthese two different influences, the girl turned out half servant, half\r\nyoung lady. They called her Katusha, which sounds less refined than\r\nKatinka, but is not quite so common as Katka. She used to sew, tidy up\r\nthe rooms, polish the metal cases of the icons and do other light work,\r\nand sometimes she sat and read to the ladies.\r\n\r\nThough she had more than one offer, she would not marry. She felt that\r\nlife as the wife of any of the working men who were courting her would\r\nbe too hard; spoilt as she was by a life of case.\r\n\r\nShe lived in this manner till she was sixteen, when the nephew of the\r\nold ladies, a rich young prince, and a university student, came to\r\nstay with his aunts, and Katusha, not daring to acknowledge it even to\r\nherself, fell in love with him.\r\n\r\nThen two years later this same nephew stayed four days with his aunts\r\nbefore proceeding to join his regiment, and the night before he left he\r\nbetrayed Katusha, and, after giving her a 100-rouble note, went away.\r\nFive months later she knew for certain that she was to be a mother.\r\nAfter that everything seemed repugnant to her, her only thought being\r\nhow to escape from the shame that awaited her. She began not only to\r\nserve the ladies in a half-hearted and negligent way, but once, without\r\nknowing how it happened, was very rude to them, and gave them notice,\r\na thing she repented of later, and the ladies let her go, noticing\r\nsomething wrong and very dissatisfied with her. Then she got a\r\nhousemaid\'s place in a police-officer\'s house, but stayed there only\r\nthree months, for the police officer, a man of fifty, began to torment\r\nher, and once, when he was in a specially enterprising mood, she fired\r\nup, called him "a fool and old devil," and gave him such a knock in the\r\nchest that he fell. She was turned out for her rudeness. It was useless\r\nto look for another situation, for the time of her confinement was\r\ndrawing near, so she went to the house of a village midwife, who also\r\nsold wine. The confinement was easy; but the midwife, who had a case of\r\nfever in the village, infected Katusha, and her baby boy had to be sent\r\nto the foundlings\' hospital, where, according to the words of the old\r\nwoman who took him there, he at once died. When Katusha went to the\r\nmidwife she had 127 roubles in all, 27 which she had earned and 100\r\ngiven her by her betrayer. When she left she had but six roubles; she\r\ndid not know how to keep money, but spent it on herself, and gave to\r\nall who asked. The midwife took 40 roubles for two months\' board and\r\nattendance, 25 went to get the baby into the foundlings\' hospital, and\r\n40 the midwife borrowed to buy a cow with. Twenty roubles went just for\r\nclothes and dainties. Having nothing left to live on, Katusha had to\r\nlook out for a place again, and found one in the house of a forester.\r\nThe forester was a married man, but he, too, began to annoy her from the\r\nfirst day. He disgusted her, and she tried to avoid him. But he, more\r\nexperienced and cunning, besides being her master, who could send her\r\nwherever he liked, managed to accomplish his object. His wife found it\r\nout, and, catching Katusha and her husband in a room all by themselves,\r\nbegan beating her. Katusha defended herself, and they had a fight, and\r\nKatusha got turned out of the house without being paid her wages.\r\n\r\nThen Katusha went to live with her aunt in town. The aunt\'s husband,\r\na bookbinder, had once been comfortably off, but had lost all his\r\ncustomers, and had taken to drink, and spent all he could lay hands\r\non at the public-house. The aunt kept a little laundry, and managed to\r\nsupport herself, her children, and her wretched husband. She offered\r\nKatusha the place of an assistant laundress; but seeing what a life of\r\nmisery and hardship her aunt\'s assistants led, Katusha hesitated, and\r\napplied to a registry office for a place. One was found for her with a\r\nlady who lived with her two sons, pupils at a public day school. A\r\nweek after Katusha had entered the house the elder, a big fellow with\r\nmoustaches, threw up his studies and made love to her, continually\r\nfollowing her about. His mother laid all the blame on Katusha, and gave\r\nher notice.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that, after many fruitless attempts to find a situation,\r\nKatusha again went to the registry office, and there met a woman with\r\nbracelets on her bare, plump arms and rings on most of her fingers.\r\nHearing that Katusha was badly in want of a place, the woman gave her\r\nher address, and invited her to come to her house. Katusha went. The\r\nwoman received her very kindly, set cake and sweet wine before her,\r\nthen wrote a note and gave it to a servant to take to somebody. In the\r\nevening a tall man, with long, grey hair and a white beard, entered the\r\nroom, and sat down at once near Katusha, smiling and gazing at her with\r\nglistening eyes. He began joking with her. The hostess called him away\r\ninto the next room, and Katusha heard her say, "A fresh one from the\r\ncountry," Then the hostess called Katusha aside and told her that the\r\nman was an author, and that he had a great deal of money, and that if\r\nhe liked her he would not grudge her anything. He did like her, and gave\r\nher 25 roubles, promising to see her often. The 25 roubles soon went;\r\nsome she paid to her aunt for board and lodging; the rest was spent on\r\na hat, ribbons, and such like. A few days later the author sent for her,\r\nand she went. He gave her another 25 roubles, and offered her a separate\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\nNext door to the lodging rented for her by the author there lived a\r\njolly young shopman, with whom Katusha soon fell in love. She told\r\nthe author, and moved to a little lodging of her own. The shopman, who\r\npromised to marry her, went to Nijni on business without mentioning it\r\nto her, having evidently thrown her up, and Katusha remained alone. She\r\nmeant to continue living in the lodging by herself, but was informed\r\nby the police that in this case she would have to get a license. She\r\nreturned to her aunt. Seeing her fine dress, her hat, and mantle, her\r\naunt no longer offered her laundry work. As she understood things, her\r\nniece had risen above that sort of thing. The question as to whether she\r\nwas to become a laundress or not did not occur to Katusha, either. She\r\nlooked with pity at the thin, hard-worked laundresses, some already in\r\nconsumption, who stood washing or ironing with their thin arms in the\r\nfearfully hot front room, which was always full of soapy steam and\r\ndraughts from the windows, and thought with horror that she might have\r\nshared the same fate.\r\n\r\nKatusha had begun to smoke some time before, and since the young shopman\r\nhad thrown her up she was getting more and more into the habit of\r\ndrinking. It was not so much the flavour of wine that tempted her as the\r\nfact that it gave her a chance of forgetting the misery she suffered,\r\nmaking her feel more unrestrained and more confident of her own worth,\r\nwhich she was not when quite sober; without wine she felt sad and\r\nashamed. Just at this time a woman came along who offered to place her\r\nin one of the largest establishments in the city, explaining all the\r\nadvantages and benefits of the situation. Katusha had the choice before\r\nher of either going into service or accepting this offer--and she chose\r\nthe latter. Besides, it seemed to her as though, in this way, she could\r\nrevenge herself on her betrayer and the shopman and all those who had\r\ninjured her. One of the things that tempted her, and was the cause\r\nof her decision, was the woman telling her she might order her own\r\ndresses--velvet, silk, satin, low-necked ball dresses, anything she\r\nliked. A mental picture of herself in a bright yellow silk trimmed with\r\nblack velvet with low neck and short sleeves conquered her, and she gave\r\nup her passport. On the same evening the procuress took an isvostchik\r\nand drove her to the notorious house kept by Carolina Albertovna\r\nKitaeva.\r\n\r\nFrom that day a life of chronic sin against human and divine laws\r\ncommenced for Katusha Maslova, a life which is led by hundreds of\r\nthousands of women, and which is not merely tolerated but sanctioned by\r\nthe Government, anxious for the welfare of its subjects; a life\r\nwhich for nine women out of ten ends in painful disease, premature\r\ndecrepitude, and death.\r\n\r\nKatusha Maslova lived this life for seven years. During these years she\r\ntwice changed houses, and had once been to the hospital. In the seventh\r\nyear of this life, when she was twenty-six years old, happened that for\r\nwhich she was put in prison and for which she was now being taken to\r\nbe tried, after more than three months of confinement with thieves and\r\nmurderers in the stifling air of a prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF.\r\n\r\nWhen Maslova, wearied out by the long walk, reached the building,\r\naccompanied by two soldiers, Prince Dmitri Ivanovitch Nekhludoff, who\r\nhad seduced her, was still lying on his high bedstead, with a feather\r\nbed on the top of the spring mattress, in a fine, clean, well-ironed\r\nlinen night shirt, smoking a cigarette, and considering what he had to\r\ndo to-day, and what had happened yesterday.\r\n\r\nRecalling the evening he had spent with the Korchagins, a wealthy and\r\naristocratic family, whose daughter every one expected he would marry,\r\nhe sighed, and, throwing away the end of his cigarette, was going\r\nto take another out of the silver case; but, changing his mind, he\r\nresolutely raised his solid frame, and, putting down his smooth, white\r\nlegs, stepped into his slippers, threw his silk dressing gown over his\r\nbroad shoulders, and passed into his dressing-room, walking heavily\r\nand quickly. There he carefully cleaned his teeth, many of which were\r\nfilled, with tooth powder, and rinsed his mouth with scented elixir.\r\nAfter that he washed his hands with perfumed soap, cleaned his long\r\nnails with particular care, then, from a tap fixed to his marble\r\nwashstand, he let a spray of cold water run over his face and stout\r\nneck. Having finished this part of the business, he went into a third\r\nroom, where a shower bath stood ready for him. Having refreshed his\r\nfull, white, muscular body, and dried it with a rough bath sheet, he put\r\non his fine undergarments and his boots, and sat down before the glass\r\nto brush his black beard and his curly hair, that had begun to get thin\r\nabove the forehead. Everything he used, everything belonging to his\r\ntoilet, his linen, his clothes, boots, necktie, pin, studs, was of the\r\nbest quality, very quiet, simple, durable and costly.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff dressed leisurely, and went into the dining-room. A table,\r\nwhich looked very imposing with its four legs carved in the shape of\r\nlions\' paws, and a huge side-board to match, stood in the oblong room,\r\nthe floor of which had been polished by three men the day before. On\r\nthe table, which was covered with a fine, starched cloth, stood a silver\r\ncoffeepot full of aromatic coffee, a sugar basin, a jug of fresh cream,\r\nand a bread basket filled with fresh rolls, rusks, and biscuits; and\r\nbeside the plate lay the last number of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, a\r\nnewspaper, and several letters.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was just going to open his letters, when a stout, middle-aged\r\nwoman in mourning, a lace cap covering the widening parting of her hair,\r\nglided into the room. This was Agraphena Petrovna, formerly lady\'s maid\r\nto Nekhludoff\'s mother. Her mistress had died quite recently in this\r\nvery house, and she remained with the son as his housekeeper. Agraphena\r\nPetrovna had spent nearly ten years, at different times, abroad with\r\nNekhludoff\'s mother, and had the appearance and manners of a lady. She\r\nhad lived with the Nekhludoffs from the time she was a child, and had\r\nknown Dmitri Ivanovitch at the time when he was still little Mitinka.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Dmitri Ivanovitch."\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Agraphena Petrovna. What is it you want?" Nekhludoff\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"A letter from the princess; either from the mother or the daughter.\r\nThe maid brought it some time ago, and is waiting in my room," answered\r\nAgraphena Petrovna, handing him the letter with a significant smile.\r\n\r\n"All right! Directly!" said Nekhludoff, taking the letter and frowning\r\nas he noticed Agraphena Petrovna\'s smile.\r\n\r\nThat smile meant that the letter was from the younger Princess\r\nKorchagin, whom Agraphena Petrovna expected him to marry. This\r\nsupposition of hers annoyed Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll tell her to wait?" and Agraphena Petrovna took a crumb brush\r\nwhich was not in its place, put it away, and sailed out of the room.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff opened the perfumed note, and began reading it.\r\n\r\nThe note was written on a sheet of thick grey paper, with rough edges;\r\nthe writing looked English. It said:\r\n\r\nHaving assumed the task of acting as your memory, I take the liberty of\r\nreminding you that on this the 28th day of April you have to appear\r\nat the Law Courts, as juryman, and, in consequence, can on no account\r\naccompany us and Kolosoff to the picture gallery, as, with your habitual\r\nflightiness, you promised yesterday; _a moins que vous ne soyez dispose\r\na payer la cour d\'assise les 300 roubles d\'amende que vous vous refusez\r\npour votre cheval,_ for not appearing in time. I remembered it last\r\nnight after you were gone, so do not forget.\r\n\r\n                      Princess M. Korchagin.\r\n\r\nOn the other side was a postscript.\r\n\r\n_Maman vous fait dire que votre convert vous attendra jusqu\'a la nuit.\r\nVenez absolument a quelle heure que cela soit._\r\n\r\n                                    M. K.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff made a grimace. This note was a continuation of that skilful\r\nmanoeuvring which the Princess Korchagin had already practised for two\r\nmonths in order to bind him closer and closer with invisible threads.\r\nAnd yet, beside the usual hesitation of men past their youth to marry\r\nunless they are very much in love, Nekhludoff had very good reasons why,\r\neven if he did make up his mind to it, he could not propose at once. It\r\nwas not that ten years previously he had betrayed and forsaken Maslova;\r\nhe had quite forgotten that, and he would not have considered it a\r\nreason for not marrying. No! The reason was that he had a liaison with a\r\nmarried woman, and, though he considered it broken off, she did not.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was rather shy with women, and his very shyness awakened in\r\nthis married woman, the unprincipled wife of the marechal de noblesse\r\nof a district where Nekhludoff was present at an election, the desire\r\nof vanquishing him. This woman drew him into an intimacy which entangled\r\nhim more and more, while it daily became more distasteful to him. Having\r\nsuccumbed to the temptation, Nekhludoff felt guilty, and had not the\r\ncourage to break the tie without her consent. And this was the reason he\r\ndid not feel at liberty to propose to Korchagin even if he had wished to\r\ndo so. Among the letters on the table was one from this woman\'s husband.\r\nSeeing his writing and the postmark, Nekhludoff flushed, and felt his\r\nenergies awakening, as they always did when he was facing any kind of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nBut his excitement passed at once. The marechal do noblesse, of the\r\ndistrict in which his largest estate lay, wrote only to let Nekhludoff\r\nknow that there was to be a special meeting towards the end of May, and\r\nthat Nekhludoff was to be sure and come to "_donner un coup d\'epaule_,"\r\nat the important debates concerning the schools and the roads, as a\r\nstrong opposition by the reactionary party was expected.\r\n\r\nThe marechal was a liberal, and was quite engrossed in this fight, not\r\neven noticing the misfortune that had befallen him.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff remembered the dreadful moments he had lived through; once\r\nwhen he thought that the husband had found him out and was going to\r\nchallenge him, and he was making up his mind to fire into the air; also\r\nthe terrible scene he had with her when she ran out into the park, and\r\nin her excitement tried to drown herself in the pond.\r\n\r\n"Well, I cannot go now, and can do nothing until I get a reply from\r\nher," thought Nekhludoff. A week ago he had written her a decisive\r\nletter, in which he acknowledged his guilt, and his readiness to atone\r\nfor it; but at the same time he pronounced their relations to be at an\r\nend, for her own good, as he expressed it. To this letter he had as yet\r\nreceived no answer. This might prove a good sign, for if she did not\r\nagree to break off their relations, she would have written at once, or\r\neven come herself, as she had done before. Nekhludoff had heard that\r\nthere was some officer who was paying her marked attention, and this\r\ntormented him by awakening jealousy, and at the same time encouraged him\r\nwith the hope of escape from the deception that was oppressing him.\r\n\r\nThe other letter was from his steward. The steward wrote to tell\r\nhim that a visit to his estates was necessary in order to enter into\r\npossession, and also to decide about the further management of his\r\nlands; whether it was to continue in the same way as when his mother was\r\nalive, or whether, as he had represented to the late lamented princess,\r\nand now advised the young prince, they had not better increase their\r\nstock and farm all the land now rented by the peasants themselves. The\r\nsteward wrote that this would be a far more profitable way of managing\r\nthe property; at the same time, he apologised for not having forwarded\r\nthe 3,000 roubles income due on the 1st. This money would be sent on by\r\nthe next mail. The reason for the delay was that he could not get the\r\nmoney out of the peasants, who had grown so untrustworthy that he had\r\nto appeal to the authorities. This letter was partly disagreeable, and\r\npartly pleasant. It was pleasant to feel that he had power over so\r\nlarge a property, and yet disagreeable, because Nekhludoff had been an\r\nenthusiastic admirer of Henry George and Herbert Spencer. Being himself\r\nheir to a large property, he was especially struck by the position\r\ntaken up by Spencer in Social Statics, that justice forbids private\r\nlandholding, and with the straightforward resoluteness of his age, had\r\nnot merely spoken to prove that land could not be looked upon as private\r\nproperty, and written essays on that subject at the university, but had\r\nacted up to his convictions, and, considering it wrong to hold landed\r\nproperty, had given the small piece of land he had inherited from his\r\nfather to the peasants. Inheriting his mother\'s large estates, and thus\r\nbecoming a landed proprietor, he had to choose one of two things: either\r\nto give up his property, as he had given up his father\'s land ten years\r\nbefore, or silently to confess that all his former ideas were mistaken\r\nand false.\r\n\r\nHe could not choose the former because he had no means but the landed\r\nestates (he did not care to serve); moreover, he had formed luxurious\r\nhabits which he could not easily give up. Besides, he had no longer the\r\nsame inducements; his strong convictions, the resoluteness of youth, and\r\nthe ambitious desire to do something unusual were gone. As to the second\r\ncourse, that of denying those clear and unanswerable proofs of the\r\ninjustice of landholding, which he had drawn from Spencer\'s Social\r\nStatics, and the brilliant corroboration of which he had at a later\r\nperiod found in the works of Henry George, such a course was impossible\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMISSY.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff had finished his coffee, he went to his study to look\r\nat the summons, and find out what time he was to appear at the court,\r\nbefore writing his answer to the princess. Passing through his studio,\r\nwhere a few studies hung on the walls and, facing the easel, stood an\r\nunfinished picture, a feeling of inability to advance in art, a sense of\r\nhis incapacity, came over him. He had often had this feeling, of late,\r\nand explained it by his too finely-developed aesthetic taste; still, the\r\nfeeling was a very unpleasant one. Seven years before this he had given\r\nup military service, feeling sure that he had a talent for art, and had\r\nlooked down with some disdain at all other activity from the height of\r\nhis artistic standpoint. And now it turned out that he had no right\r\nto do so, and therefore everything that reminded him of all this was\r\nunpleasant. He looked at the luxurious fittings of the studio with a\r\nheavy heart, and it was in no cheerful mood that he entered his study,\r\na large, lofty room fitted up with a view to comfort, convenience,\r\nand elegant appearance. He found the summons at once in a pigeon hole,\r\nlabelled "immediate," of his large writing table. He had to appear at\r\nthe court at 11 o\'clock.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat down to write a note in reply to the princess, thanking\r\nher for the invitation, and promising to try and come to dinner. Having\r\nwritten one note, he tore it up, as it seemed too intimate. He wrote\r\nanother, but it was too cold; he feared it might give offence, so he\r\ntore it up, too. He pressed the button of an electric bell, and his\r\nservant, an elderly, morose-looking man, with whiskers and shaved chin\r\nand lip, wearing a grey cotton apron, entered at the door.\r\n\r\n"Send to fetch an isvostchik, please."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And tell the person who is waiting that I send thanks for the\r\ninvitation, and shall try to come."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"It is not very polite, but I can\'t write; no matter, I shall see her\r\ntoday," thought Nekhludoff, and went to get his overcoat.\r\n\r\nWhen he came out of the house, an isvostchik he knew, with india-rubber\r\ntires to his trap, was at the door waiting for him. "You had hardly gone\r\naway from Prince Korchagin\'s yesterday," he said, turning half round,\r\n"when I drove up, and the Swiss at the door says, \'just gone.\'" The\r\nisvostchik knew that Nekhludoff visited at the Korchagins, and called\r\nthere on the chance of being engaged by him.\r\n\r\n"Even the isvostchiks know of my relations with the Korchagins," thought\r\nNekhludoff, and again the question whether he should not marry Princess\r\nKorchagin presented itself to him, and he could not decide it either\r\nway, any more than most of the questions that arose in his mind at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt was in favour of marriage in general, that besides the comforts\r\nof hearth and home, it made a moral life possible, and chiefly that a\r\nfamily would, so Nekhludoff thought, give an aim to his now empty life.\r\n\r\nAgainst marriage in general was the fear, common to bachelors past\r\ntheir first youth, of losing freedom, and an unconscious awe before this\r\nmysterious creature, a woman.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, in favour of marrying Missy (her name was Mary,\r\nbut, as is usual among a certain set, a nickname had been given her)\r\nwas that she came of good family, and differed in everything, manner\r\nof speaking, walking, laughing, from the common people, not by anything\r\nexceptional, but by her "good breeding"--he could find no other term\r\nfor this quality, though he prized it very highly---and, besides, she\r\nthought more of him than of anybody else, therefore evidently understood\r\nhim. This understanding of him, i.e., the recognition of his superior\r\nmerits, was to Nekhludoff a proof of her good sense and correct\r\njudgment. Against marrying Missy in particular, was, that in all\r\nlikelihood, a girl with even higher qualities could be found, that she\r\nwas already 27, and that he was hardly her first love. This last idea\r\nwas painful to him. His pride would not reconcile itself with the\r\nthought that she had loved some one else, even in the past. Of course,\r\nshe could not have known that she should meet him, but the thought that\r\nshe was capable of loving another offended him. So that he had as many\r\nreasons for marrying as against it; at any rate, they weighed equally\r\nwith Nekhludoff, who laughed at himself, and called himself the ass of\r\nthe fable, remaining like that animal undecided which haycock to turn\r\nto.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, before I get an answer from Mary Vasilievna (the\r\nmarechal\'s wife), and finish completely with her, I can do nothing," he\r\nsaid to himself. And the conviction that he might, and was even obliged,\r\nto delay his decision, was comforting. "Well, I shall consider all that\r\nlater on," he said to himself, as the trap drove silently along the\r\nasphalt pavement up to the doors of the Court.\r\n\r\n"Now I must fulfil my public duties conscientiously, as I am in the\r\nhabit of always doing, and as I consider it right to do. Besides, they\r\nare often interesting." And he entered the hall of the Law Courts, past\r\nthe doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE JURYMEN.\r\n\r\nThe corridors of the Court were already full of activity. The attendants\r\nhurried, out of breath, dragging their feet along the ground without\r\nlifting them, backwards and forwards, with all sorts of messages and\r\npapers. Ushers, advocates, and law officers passed hither and thither.\r\nPlaintiffs, and those of the accused who were not guarded, wandered\r\nsadly along the walls or sat waiting.\r\n\r\n"Where is the Law Court?" Nekhludoff asked of an attendant.\r\n\r\n"Which? There is the Civil Court and the Criminal Court."\r\n\r\n"I am on the jury."\r\n\r\n"The Criminal Court you should have said. Here to the right, then to the\r\nleft--the second door."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff followed the direction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile some of the Criminal Court jurymen who were late had hurriedly\r\npassed into a separate room. At the door mentioned two men stood\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nOne, a tall, fat merchant, a kind-hearted fellow, had evidently partaken\r\nof some refreshments and a glass of something, and was in most pleasant\r\nspirits. The other was a shopman of Jewish extraction. They were talking\r\nabout the price of wool when Nekhludoff came up and asked them if this\r\nwas the jurymen\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear sir, this is it. One of us? On the jury, are you?" asked\r\nthe merchant, with a merry wink.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, we shall have a go at the work together," he continued, after\r\nNekhludoff had answered in the affirmative. "My name is Baklasheff,\r\nmerchant of the Second Guild," he said, putting out his broad, soft,\r\nflexible hand.\r\n\r\n"With whom have I the honour?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff gave his name and passed into the jurymen\'s room.\r\n\r\nInside the room were about ten persons of all sorts. They had come but\r\na short while ago, and some were sitting, others walking up and down,\r\nlooking at each other, and making each other\'s acquaintance. There was a\r\nretired colonel in uniform; some were in frock coats, others in morning\r\ncoats, and only one wore a peasant\'s dress.\r\n\r\nTheir faces all had a certain look of satisfaction at the prospect of\r\nfulfilling a public duty, although many of them had had to leave their\r\nbusinesses, and most were complaining of it.\r\n\r\nThe jurymen talked among themselves about the weather, the early spring,\r\nand the business before them, some having been introduced, others just\r\nguessing who was who. Those who were not acquainted with Nekhludoff made\r\nhaste to get introduced, evidently looking upon this as an honour, and\r\nhe taking it as his due, as he always did when among strangers. Had he\r\nbeen asked why he considered himself above the majority of people, he\r\ncould not have given an answer; the life he had been living of late was\r\nnot particularly meritorious. The fact of his speaking English, French,\r\nand German with a good accent, and of his wearing the best linen,\r\nclothes, ties, and studs, bought from the most expensive dealers in\r\nthese goods, he quite knew would not serve as a reason for claiming\r\nsuperiority. At the same time he did claim superiority, and accepted the\r\nrespect paid him as his due, and was hurt if he did not get it. In the\r\njurymen\'s room his feelings were hurt by disrespectful treatment. Among\r\nthe jury there happened to be a man whom he knew, a former teacher of\r\nhis sister\'s children, Peter Gerasimovitch. Nekhludoff never knew his\r\nsurname, and even bragged a bit about this. This man was now a master\r\nat a public school. Nekhludoff could not stand his familiarity, his\r\nself-satisfied laughter, his vulgarity, in short.\r\n\r\n"Ah ha! You\'re also trapped." These were the words, accompanied with\r\nboisterous laughter, with which Peter Gerasimovitch greeted Nekhludoff.\r\n"Have you not managed to get out of it?"\r\n\r\n"I never meant to get out of it," replied Nekhludoff, gloomily, and in a\r\ntone of severity.\r\n\r\n"Well, I call this being public spirited. But just wait until you get\r\nhungry or sleepy; you\'ll sing to another tune then."\r\n\r\n"This son of a priest will be saying \'thou\' [in Russian, as in many\r\nother languages, \'thou\' is used generally among people very familiar\r\nwith each other, or by superiors to inferiors] to me next," thought\r\nNekhludoff, and walked away, with such a look of sadness on his face,\r\nas might have been natural if he had just heard of the death of all\r\nhis relations. He came up to a group that had formed itself round a\r\nclean-shaven, tall, dignified man, who was recounting something with\r\ngreat animation. This man was talking about the trial going on in the\r\nCivil Court as of a case well known to himself, mentioning the judges\r\nand a celebrated advocate by name. He was saying that it seemed\r\nwonderful how the celebrated advocate had managed to give such a clever\r\nturn to the affair that an old lady, though she had the right on her\r\nside, would have to pay a large sum to her opponent. "The advocate is a\r\ngenius," he said.\r\n\r\nThe listeners heard it all with respectful attention, and several of\r\nthem tried to put in a word, but the man interrupted them, as if he\r\nalone knew all about it.\r\n\r\nThough Nekhludoff had arrived late, he had to wait a long time. One\r\nof the members of the Court had not yet come, and everybody was kept\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGES.\r\n\r\nThe president, who had to take the chair, had arrived early. The\r\npresident was a tall, stout man, with long grey whiskers. Though\r\nmarried, he led a very loose life, and his wife did the same, so they\r\ndid not stand in each other\'s way. This morning he had received a note\r\nfrom a Swiss girl, who had formerly been a governess in his house, and\r\nwho was now on her way from South Russia to St. Petersburg. She wrote\r\nthat she would wait for him between five and six p.m. in the Hotel\r\nItalia. This made him wish to begin and get through the sitting as soon\r\nas possible, so as to have time to call before six p.m. on the little\r\nred-haired Clara Vasilievna, with whom he had begun a romance in the\r\ncountry last summer. He went into a private room, latched the door, took\r\na pair of dumb-bells out of a cupboard, moved his arms 20 times upwards,\r\ndownwards, forwards, and sideways, then holding the dumb-bells above his\r\nhead, lightly bent his knees three times.\r\n\r\n"Nothing keeps one going like a cold bath and exercise," he said,\r\nfeeling the biceps of his right arm with his left hand, on the third\r\nfinger of which he wore a gold ring. He had still to do the moulinee\r\nmovement (for he always went through those two exercises before a long\r\nsitting), when there was a pull at the door. The president quickly put\r\naway the dumb-bells and opened the door, saying, "I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\nOne of the members, a high-shouldered, discontented-looking man, with\r\ngold spectacles, came into the room. "Matthew Nikitich has again not\r\ncome," he said, in a dissatisfied tone.\r\n\r\n"Not yet?" said the president, putting on his uniform. "He is always\r\nlate."\r\n\r\n"It is extraordinary. He ought to be ashamed of himself," said the\r\nmember, angrily, and taking out a cigarette.\r\n\r\nThis member, a very precise man, had had an unpleasant encounter with\r\nhis wife in the morning, because she had spent her allowance before the\r\nend of the month, and had asked him to give her some money in advance,\r\nbut he would not give way to her, and they had a quarrel. The wife told\r\nhim that if he were going to behave so, he need not expect any dinner;\r\nthere would be no dinner for him at home. At this point he left, fearing\r\nthat she might carry out her threat, for anything might be expected from\r\nher. "This comes of living a good, moral life," he thought, looking at\r\nthe beaming, healthy, cheerful, and kindly president, who, with elbows\r\nfar apart, was smoothing his thick grey whiskers with his fine white\r\nhands over the embroidered collar of his uniform. "He is always\r\ncontented and merry while I am suffering."\r\n\r\nThe secretary came in and brought some document.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, very much," said the president, lighting a cigarette. "Which\r\ncase shall we take first, then?"\r\n\r\n"The poisoning case, I should say," answered the secretary, with\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n"All right; the poisoning case let it be," said the president, thinking\r\nthat he could get this case over by four o\'clock, and then go away. "And\r\nMatthew Nikitich; has he come?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"And Breve?"\r\n\r\n"He is here," replied the secretary.\r\n\r\n"Then if you see him, please tell him that we begin with the poisoning\r\ncase." Breve was the public prosecutor, who was to read the indictment\r\nin this case.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor the secretary met Breve, who, with up lifted shoulders,\r\na portfolio under one arm, the other swinging with the palm turned to\r\nthe front, was hurrying along the corridor, clattering with his heels.\r\n\r\n"Michael Petrovitch wants to know if you are ready?" the secretary\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Of course; I am always ready," said the public prosecutor. "What are we\r\ntaking first?"\r\n\r\n"The poisoning case."\r\n\r\n"That\'s quite right," said the public prosecutor, but did not think it\r\nat all right. He had spent the night in a hotel playing cards with a\r\nfriend who was giving a farewell party. Up to five in the morning they\r\nplayed and drank, so he had no time to look at this poisoning case,\r\nand meant to run it through now. The secretary, happening to know this,\r\nadvised the president to begin with the poisoning case. The secretary\r\nwas a Liberal, even a Radical, in opinion.\r\n\r\nBreve was a Conservative; the secretary disliked him, and envied him his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n"Well, and how about the Skoptzy?" [a religious sect] asked the\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n"I have already said that I cannot do it without witnesses, and so I\r\nshall say to the Court."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, what does it matter?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot do it," said Breve; and, waving his arm, he ran into his\r\nprivate room.\r\n\r\nHe was putting off the case of the Skoptzy on account of the absence\r\nof a very unimportant witness, his real reason being that if they were\r\ntried by an educated jury they might possibly be acquitted.\r\n\r\nBy an agreement with the president this case was to be tried in the\r\ncoming session at a provincial town, where there would be more peasants,\r\nand, therefore, more chances of conviction.\r\n\r\nThe movement in the corridor increased. The people crowded most at\r\nthe doors of the Civil Court, in which the case that the dignified man\r\ntalked about was being heard.\r\n\r\nAn interval in the proceeding occurred, and the old woman came out of\r\nthe court, whose property that genius of an advocate had found means of\r\ngetting for his client, a person versed in law who had no right to it\r\nwhatever. The judges knew all about the case, and the advocate and his\r\nclient knew it better still, but the move they had invented was such\r\nthat it was impossible not to take the old woman\'s property and not to\r\nhand it over to the person versed in law.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was stout, well dressed, and had enormous flowers on her\r\nbonnet; she stopped as she came out of the door, and spreading out her\r\nshort fat arms and turning to her advocate, she kept repeating. "What\r\ndoes it all mean? just fancy!"\r\n\r\nThe advocate was looking at the flowers in her bonnet, and evidently not\r\nlistening to her, but considering some question or other.\r\n\r\nNext to the old woman, out of the door of the Civil Court, his broad,\r\nstarched shirt front glistening from under his low-cut waistcoat, with\r\na self-satisfied look on his face, came the celebrated advocate who had\r\nmanaged to arrange matters so that the old woman lost all she had, and\r\nthe person versed in the law received more than 100,000 roubles. The\r\nadvocate passed close to the old woman, and, feeling all eyes directed\r\ntowards him, his whole bearing seemed to say: "No expressions of\r\ndeference are required."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICIALS OF THE COURT.\r\n\r\nAt last Matthew Nikitich also arrived, and the usher, a thin man, with a\r\nlong neck and a kind of sideways walk, his nether lip protruding to one\r\nside, which made him resemble a turkey, came into the jurymen\'s room.\r\n\r\nThis usher was an honest man, and had a university education, but could\r\nnot keep a place for any length of time, as he was subject to fits of\r\ndrunkenness. Three months before a certain countess, who patronised his\r\nwife, had found him this place, and he was very pleased to have kept it\r\nso long.\r\n\r\n"Well, sirs, is everybody here?" he asked, putting his pince-nez on his\r\nnose, and looking round.\r\n\r\n"Everybody, I think," said the jolly merchant.\r\n\r\n"All right; we\'ll soon see." And, taking a list from his pocket, he\r\nbegan calling out the names, looking at the men, sometimes through and\r\nsometimes over his pince-nez.\r\n\r\n"Councillor of State, [grades such as this are common in Russia, and\r\nmean very little] J. M. Nikiforoff!"\r\n\r\n"I am he," said the dignified-looking man, well versed in the habits of\r\nthe law court.\r\n\r\n"Ivan Semionovitch Ivanoff, retired colonel!"\r\n\r\n"Here!" replied a thin man, in the uniform of a retired officer.\r\n\r\n"Merchant of the Second Guild, Peter Baklasheff!"\r\n\r\n"Here we are, ready!" said the good-humoured merchant, with a broad\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Lieutenant of the Guards, Prince Dmitri Nekhludoff!"\r\n\r\n"I am he," answered Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nThe usher bowed to him, looking over his pince-nez, politely and\r\npleasantly, as if wishing to distinguish him from the others.\r\n\r\n"Captain Youri Demitrievitch-Dantchenko, merchant; Grigori Euphimitch\r\nKouleshoff," etc. All but two were present.\r\n\r\n"Now please to come to the court, gentlemen," said the usher, pointing\r\nto the door, with an amiable wave of his hand.\r\n\r\nAll moved towards the door, pausing to let each other pass. Then they\r\nwent through the corridor into the court.\r\n\r\nThe court was a large, long room. At one end there was a raised\r\nplatform, with three steps leading up to it, on which stood a table,\r\ncovered with a green cloth trimmed with a fringe of a darker shade. At\r\nthe table were placed three arm-chairs, with high-carved oak backs; on\r\nthe wall behind them hung a full-length, brightly-coloured portrait of\r\nthe Emperor in uniform and ribbon, with one foot in advance, and holding\r\na sword. In the right corner hung a case, with an image of Christ\r\ncrowned with thorns, and beneath it stood a lectern, and on the same\r\nside the prosecuting attorney\'s desk. On the left, opposite the desk,\r\nwas the secretary\'s table, and in front of it, nearer the public, an\r\noak grating, with the prisoners\' bench, as yet unoccupied, behind\r\nit. Besides all this, there were on the right side of the platform\r\nhigh-backed ashwood chairs for the jury, and on the floor below tables\r\nfor the advocates. All this was in the front part of the court, divided\r\nfrom the back by a grating.\r\n\r\nThe back was all taken up by seats in tiers. Sitting on the front seats\r\nwere four women, either servant or factory girls, and two working men,\r\nevidently overawed by the grandeur of the room, and not venturing to\r\nspeak above a whisper.\r\n\r\nSoon after the jury had come in the usher entered, with his sideward\r\ngait, and stepping to the front, called out in a loud voice, as if he\r\nmeant to frighten those present, "The Court is coming!" Every one got\r\nup as the members stepped on to the platform. Among them the president,\r\nwith his muscles and fine whiskers. Next came the gloomy member of the\r\nCourt, who was now more gloomy than ever, having met his brother-in-law,\r\nwho informed him that he had just called in to see his sister (the\r\nmember\'s wife), and that she had told him that there would be no dinner\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"So that, evidently, we shall have to call in at a cook shop," the\r\nbrother-in-law added, laughing.\r\n\r\n"It is not at all funny," said the gloomy member, and became gloomier\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThen at last came the third member of the Court, the same Matthew\r\nNikitich, who was always late. He was a bearded man, with large, round,\r\nkindly eyes. He was suffering from a catarrh of the stomach, and,\r\naccording to his doctor\'s advice, he had begun trying a new treatment,\r\nand this had kept him at home longer than usual. Now, as he was\r\nascending the platform, he had a pensive air. He was in the habit of\r\nmaking guesses in answer to all sorts of self-put questions by different\r\ncurious means. Just now he had asked whether the new treatment would be\r\nbeneficial, and had decided that it would cure his catarrh if the number\r\nof steps from the door to his chair would divide by three. He made 26\r\nsteps, but managed to get in a 27th just by his chair.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the president and the members in their uniforms, with\r\ngold-embroidered collars, looked very imposing. They seemed to feel this\r\nthemselves, and, as if overpowered by their own grandeur, hurriedly sat\r\ndown on the high backed chairs behind the table with the green cloth,\r\non which were a triangular article with an eagle at the top, two glass\r\nvases--something like those in which sweetmeats are kept in refreshment\r\nrooms--an inkstand, pens, clean paper, and good, newly-cut pencils of\r\ndifferent kinds.\r\n\r\nThe public prosecutor came in with the judges. With his portfolio under\r\none arm, and swinging the other, he hurriedly walked to his seat near\r\nthe window, and was instantly absorbed in reading and looking through\r\nthe papers, not wasting a single moment, in hope of being ready when the\r\nbusiness commenced. He had been public prosecutor but a short time, and\r\nhad only prosecuted four times before this. He was very ambitious,\r\nand had firmly made up his mind to get on, and therefore thought it\r\nnecessary to get a conviction whenever he prosecuted. He knew the chief\r\nfacts of the poisoning case, and had already formed a plan of action. He\r\nonly wanted to copy out a few points which he required.\r\n\r\nThe secretary sat on the opposite side of the platform, and, having\r\ngot ready all the papers he might want, was looking through an article,\r\nprohibited by the censor, which he had procured and read the day before.\r\nHe was anxious to have a talk about this article with the bearded\r\nmember, who shared his views, but wanted to look through it once more\r\nbefore doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSWEARING IN THE JURY.\r\n\r\nThe president, having looked through some papers and put a few questions\r\nto the usher and the secretary, gave the order for the prisoners to be\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\nThe door behind the grating was instantly opened, and two gendarmes,\r\nwith caps on their heads, and holding naked swords in their hands,\r\ncame in, followed by the prisoners, a red-haired, freckled man, and two\r\nwomen. The man wore a prison cloak, which was too long and too wide for\r\nhim. He stuck out his thumbs, and held his arms close to his sides, thus\r\nkeeping the sleeves, which were also too long, from slipping over his\r\nhands. Without looking at the judges he gazed steadfastly at the form,\r\nand passing to the other side of it, he sat down carefully at the very\r\nedge, leaving plenty of room for the others. He fixed his eyes on the\r\npresident, and began moving the muscles of his cheeks, as if whispering\r\nsomething. The woman who came next was also dressed in a prison cloak,\r\nand had a prison kerchief round her head. She had a sallow complexion,\r\nno eyebrows or lashes, and very red eyes. This woman appeared perfectly\r\ncalm. Having caught her cloak against something, she detached it\r\ncarefully, without any haste, and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe third prisoner was Maslova.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she appeared, the eyes of all the men in the court turned\r\nher way, and remained fixed on her white face, her sparklingly-brilliant\r\nblack eyes and the swelling bosom under the prison cloak. Even the\r\ngendarme whom she passed on her way to her seat looked at her fixedly\r\ntill she sat down, and then, as if feeling guilty, hurriedly turned\r\naway, shook himself, and began staring at the window in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe president paused until the prisoners had taken their seats, and when\r\nMaslova was seated, turned to the secretary.\r\n\r\nThen the usual procedure commenced; the counting of the jury, remarks\r\nabout those who had not come, the fixing of the fines to be exacted\r\nfrom them, the decisions concerning those who claimed exemption, the\r\nappointing of reserve jurymen.\r\n\r\nHaving folded up some bits of paper and put them in one of the glass\r\nvases, the president turned up the gold-embroidered cuffs of his uniform\r\na little way, and began drawing the lots, one by one, and opening them.\r\nNekhludoff was among the jurymen thus drawn. Then, having let down his\r\nsleeves, the president requested the priest to swear in the jury.\r\n\r\nThe old priest, with his puffy, red face, his brown gown, and his gold\r\ncross and little order, laboriously moving his stiff legs, came up to\r\nthe lectern beneath the icon.\r\n\r\nThe jurymen got up, and crowded towards the lectern.\r\n\r\n"Come up, please," said the priest, pulling at the cross on his breast\r\nwith his plump hand, and waiting till all the jury had drawn near. When\r\nthey had all come up the steps of the platform, the priest passed his\r\nbald, grey head sideways through the greasy opening of the stole, and,\r\nhaving rearranged his thin hair, he again turned to the jury. "Now,\r\nraise your right arms in this way, and put your fingers together, thus,"\r\nhe said, with his tremulous old voice, lifting his fat, dimpled hand,\r\nand putting the thumb and two first fingers together, as if taking a\r\npinch of something. "Now, repeat after me, \'I promise and swear, by the\r\nAlmighty God, by His holy gospels, and by the life-giving cross of\r\nour Lord, that in this work which,\'" he said, pausing between each\r\nsentence--"don\'t let your arm down; hold it like this," he remarked to a\r\nyoung man who had lowered his arm--"\'that in this work which . . . \'"\r\n\r\nThe dignified man with the whiskers, the colonel, the merchant, and\r\nseveral more held their arms and fingers as the priest required of\r\nthem, very high, very exactly, as if they liked doing it; others did it\r\nunwillingly and carelessly. Some repeated the words too loudly, and with\r\na defiant tone, as if they meant to say, "In spite of all, I will and\r\nshall speak." Others whispered very low, and not fast enough, and\r\nthen, as if frightened, hurried to catch up the priest. Some kept their\r\nfingers tightly together, as if fearing to drop the pinch of invisible\r\nsomething they held; others kept separating and folding theirs. Every\r\none save the old priest felt awkward, but he was sure he was fulfilling\r\na very useful and important duty.\r\n\r\nAfter the swearing in, the president requested the jury to choose\r\na foreman, and the jury, thronging to the door, passed out into\r\nthe debating-room, where almost all of them at once began to smoke\r\ncigarettes. Some one proposed the dignified man as foreman, and he was\r\nunanimously accepted. Then the jurymen put out their cigarettes and\r\nthrew them away and returned to the court. The dignified man informed\r\nthe president that he was chosen foreman, and all sat down again on the\r\nhigh-backed chairs.\r\n\r\nEverything went smoothly, quickly, and not without a certain solemnity.\r\nAnd this exactitude, order, and solemnity evidently pleased those\r\nwho took part in it: it strengthened the impression that they were\r\nfulfilling a serious and valuable public duty. Nekhludoff, too, felt\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the jurymen were seated, the president made a speech on\r\ntheir rights, obligations, and responsibilities. While speaking he kept\r\nchanging his position; now leaning on his right, now on his left hand,\r\nnow against the back, then on the arms of his chair, now putting the\r\npapers straight, now handling his pencil and paper-knife.\r\n\r\nAccording to his words, they had the right of interrogating the\r\nprisoners through the president, to use paper and pencils, and to\r\nexamine the articles put in as evidence. Their duty was to judge not\r\nfalsely, but justly. Their responsibility meant that if the secrecy of\r\ntheir discussion were violated, or communications were established with\r\noutsiders, they would be liable to punishment. Every one listened with\r\nan expression of respectful attention. The merchant, diffusing a smell\r\nof brandy around him, and restraining loud hiccups, approvingly nodded\r\nhis head at every sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE PRISONERS QUESTIONED.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his speech, the president turned to the male\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n"Simeon Kartinkin, rise."\r\n\r\nSimeon jumped up, his lips continuing to move nervously and inaudibly.\r\n\r\n"Your name?"\r\n\r\n"Simon Petrov Kartinkin," he said, rapidly, with a cracked voice, having\r\nevidently prepared the answer.\r\n\r\n"What class do you belong to?"\r\n\r\n"Peasant."\r\n\r\n"What government, district, and parish?"\r\n\r\n"Toula Government, Krapivinskia district, Koupianovski parish, the\r\nvillage Borki."\r\n\r\n"Your age?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty-three; born in the year one thousand eight--"\r\n\r\n"What religion?"\r\n\r\n"Of the Russian religion, orthodox."\r\n\r\n"Married?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir."\r\n\r\n"Your occupation?"\r\n\r\n"I had a place in the Hotel Mauritania."\r\n\r\n"Have you ever been tried before?"\r\n\r\n"I never got tried before, because, as we used to live formerly--"\r\n\r\n"So you never were tried before?"\r\n\r\n"God forbid, never."\r\n\r\n"Have you received a copy of the indictment?"\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"Sit down."\r\n\r\n"Euphemia Ivanovna Botchkova," said the president, turning to the next\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nBut Simon continued standing in front of Botchkova.\r\n\r\n"Kartinkin, sit down!" Kartinkin continued standing.\r\n\r\n"Kartinkin, sit down!" But Kartinkin sat down only when the usher, with\r\nhis head on one side, and with preternaturally wide-open eyes, ran up,\r\nand said, in a tragic whisper, "Sit down, sit down!"\r\n\r\nKartinkin sat down as hurriedly as he had risen, wrapping his cloak\r\nround him, and again began moving his lips silently.\r\n\r\n"Your name?" asked the president, with a weary sigh at being obliged to\r\nrepeat the same questions, without looking at the prisoner, but glancing\r\nover a paper that lay before him. The president was so used to his task\r\nthat, in order to get quicker through it all, he did two things at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBotchkova was forty-three years old, and came from the town of Kalomna.\r\nShe, too, had been in service at the Hotel Mauritania.\r\n\r\n"I have never been tried before, and have received a copy of the\r\nindictment." She gave her answers boldly, in a tone of voice as if she\r\nmeant to add to each answer, "And I don\'t care who knows it, and I won\'t\r\nstand any nonsense."\r\n\r\nShe did not wait to be told, but sat down as soon as she had replied to\r\nthe last question.\r\n\r\n"Your name?" turning abruptly to the third prisoner. "You will have to\r\nrise," he added, softly and gently, seeing that Maslova kept her seat.\r\n\r\nMaslova got up and stood, with her chest expanded, looking at the\r\npresident with that peculiar expression of readiness in her smiling\r\nblack eyes.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?"\r\n\r\n"Lubov," she said.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had put on his pince-nez, looking at the prisoners while they\r\nwere being questioned.\r\n\r\n"No, it is impossible," he thought, not taking his eyes off the\r\nprisoner. "Lubov! How can it be?" he thought to himself, after hearing\r\nher answer. The president was going to continue his questions, but\r\nthe member with the spectacles interrupted him, angrily whispering\r\nsomething. The president nodded, and turned again to the prisoner.\r\n\r\n"How is this," he said, "you are not put down here as Lubov?"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner remained silent.\r\n\r\n"I want your real name."\r\n\r\n"What is your baptismal name?" asked the angry member.\r\n\r\n"Formerly I used to be called Katerina."\r\n\r\n"No, it cannot be," said Nekhludoff to himself; and yet he was now\r\ncertain that this was she, that same girl, half ward, half servant to\r\nhis aunts; that Katusha, with whom he had once been in love, really\r\nin love, but whom he had betrayed and then abandoned, and never again\r\nbrought to mind, for the memory would have been too painful, would\r\nhave convicted him too clearly, proving that he who was so proud of his\r\nintegrity had treated this woman in a revolting, scandalous way.\r\n\r\nYes, this was she. He now clearly saw in her face that strange,\r\nindescribable individuality which distinguishes every face from all\r\nothers; something peculiar, all its own, not to be found anywhere else.\r\nIn spite of the unhealthy pallor and the fulness of the face, it was\r\nthere, this sweet, peculiar individuality; on those lips, in the slight\r\nsquint of her eyes, in the voice, particularly in the naive smile, and\r\nin the expression of readiness on the face and figure.\r\n\r\n"You should have said so," remarked the president, again in a gentle\r\ntone. "Your patronymic?"\r\n\r\n"I am illegitimate."\r\n\r\n"Well, were you not called by your godfather\'s name?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mikhaelovna."\r\n\r\n"And what is it she can be guilty of?" continued Nekhludoff, in his\r\nmind, unable to breathe freely.\r\n\r\n"Your family name--your surname, I mean?" the president went on.\r\n\r\n"They used to call me by my mother\'s surname, Maslova."\r\n\r\n"What class?"\r\n\r\n"Meschanka." [the lowest town class or grade]\r\n\r\n"Religion--orthodox?"\r\n\r\n"Orthodox."\r\n\r\n"Occupation. What was your occupation?"\r\n\r\nMaslova remained silent.\r\n\r\n"What was your employment?"\r\n\r\n"You know yourself," she said, and smiled. Then, casting a hurried look\r\nround the room, again turned her eyes on the president.\r\n\r\nThere was something so unusual in the expression of her face, so\r\nterrible and piteous in the meaning of the words she had uttered, in\r\nthis smile, and in the furtive glance she had cast round the room, that\r\nthe president was abashed, and for a few minutes silence reigned in the\r\ncourt. The silence was broken by some one among the public laughing,\r\nthen somebody said "Ssh," and the president looked up and continued:\r\n\r\n"Have you ever been tried before?"\r\n\r\n"Never," answered Maslova, softly, and sighed.\r\n\r\n"Have you received a copy of the indictment?"\r\n\r\n"I have," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Sit down."\r\n\r\nThe prisoner leant back to pick up her skirt in the way a fine lady\r\npicks up her train, and sat down, folding her small white hands in the\r\nsleeves of her cloak, her eyes fixed on the president. Her face was calm\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses were called, and some sent away; the doctor who was to act\r\nas expert was chosen and called into the court.\r\n\r\nThen the secretary got up and began reading the indictment. He read\r\ndistinctly, though he pronounced the "I" and "r" alike, with a loud\r\nvoice, but so quickly that the words ran into one another and formed one\r\nuninterrupted, dreary drone.\r\n\r\nThe judges bent now on one, now on the other arm of their chairs, then\r\non the table, then back again, shut and opened their eyes, and whispered\r\nto each other. One of the gendarmes several times repressed a yawn.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner Kartinkin never stopped moving his cheeks. Botchkova sat\r\nquite still and straight, only now and then scratching her head under\r\nthe kerchief.\r\n\r\nMaslova sat immovable, gazing at the reader; only now and then she gave\r\na slight start, as if wishing to reply, blushed, sighed heavily, and\r\nchanged the position of her hands, looked round, and again fixed her\r\neyes on the reader.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat in the front row on his high-backed chair, without\r\nremoving his pince-nez, and looked at Maslova, while a complicated and\r\nfierce struggle was going on in his soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE INDICTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe indictment ran as follows: On the 17th of January, 18--, in the\r\nlodging-house Mauritania, occurred the sudden death of the Second Guild\r\nmerchant, Therapont Emilianovich Smelkoff, of Kourgan.\r\n\r\nThe local police doctor of the fourth district certified that death was\r\ndue to rupture of the heart, owing to the excessive use of alcoholic\r\nliquids. The body of the said Smelkoff was interred. After several days\r\nhad elapsed, the merchant Timokhin, a fellow-townsman and companion\r\nof the said Smelkoff, returned from St. Petersburg, and hearing the\r\ncircumstances that accompanied the death of the latter, notified his\r\nsuspicions that the death was caused by poison, given with intent to\r\nrob the said Smelkoff of his money. This suspicion was corroborated on\r\ninquiry, which proved:\r\n\r\n1. That shortly before his death the said Smelkoff had received the sum\r\nof 3,800 roubles from the bank. When an inventory of the property of the\r\ndeceased was made, only 312 roubles and 16 copecks were found.\r\n\r\n2. The whole day and night preceding his death the said Smelkoff spent\r\nwith Lubka (alias Katerina Maslova) at her home and in the lodging-house\r\nMauritania, which she also visited at the said Smelkoff\'s request during\r\nhis absence, to get some money, which she took out of his portmanteau in\r\nthe presence of the servants of the lodging-house Mauritania, Euphemia\r\nBotchkova and Simeon Kartinkin, with a key given her by the said\r\nSmelkoff. In the portmanteau opened by the said Maslova, the said\r\nBotchkova and Kartinkin saw packets of 100-rouble bank-notes.\r\n\r\n3. On the said Smelkoff\'s return to the lodging-house Mauritania,\r\ntogether with Lubka, the latter, in accordance with the attendant\r\nKartinkin\'s advice, gave the said Smelkoff some white powder given to\r\nher by the said Kartinkin, dissolved in brandy.\r\n\r\n4. The next morning the said Lubka (alias Katerina Maslova) sold to her\r\nmistress, the witness Kitaeva, a brothel-keeper, a diamond ring given to\r\nher, as she alleged, by the said Smelkoff.\r\n\r\n5. The housemaid of the lodging-house Mauritania, Euphemia Botchkova,\r\nplaced to her account in the local Commercial Bank 1,800 roubles. The\r\npostmortem examination of the body of the said Smelkoff and the chemical\r\nanalysis of his intestines proved beyond doubt the presence of poison\r\nin the organism, so that there is reason to believe that the said\r\nSmelkoff\'s death was caused by poisoning.\r\n\r\nWhen cross-examined, the accused, Maslova, Botchkova, and Kartinkin,\r\npleaded not guilty, deposing--Maslova, that she had really been sent by\r\nSmelkoff from the brothel, where she "works," as she expresses it, to\r\nthe lodging-house Mauritania to get the merchant some money, and that,\r\nhaving unlocked the portmanteau with a key given her by the merchant,\r\nshe took out 40 roubles, as she was told to do, and that she had taken\r\nnothing more; that Botchkova and Kartinkin, in whose presence she\r\nunlocked and locked the portmanteau, could testify to the truth of the\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nShe gave this further evidence--that when she came to the lodging-house\r\nfor the second time she did, at the instigation of Simeon Kartinkin,\r\ngive Smelkoff some kind of powder, which she thought was a narcotic,\r\nin a glass of brandy, hoping he would fall asleep and that she would be\r\nable to get away from him; and that Smelkoff, having beaten her, himself\r\ngave her the ring when she cried and threatened to go away.\r\n\r\nThe accused, Euphemia Botchkova, stated that she knew nothing about the\r\nmissing money, that she had not even gone into Smelkoff\'s room, but\r\nthat Lubka had been busy there all by herself; that if anything had\r\nbeen stolen, it must have been done by Lubka when she came with the\r\nmerchant\'s key to get his money.\r\n\r\nAt this point Maslova gave a start, opened her mouth, and looked at\r\nBotchkova. "When," continued the secretary, "the receipt for 1,800\r\nroubles from the bank was shown to Botchkova, and she was asked where\r\nshe had obtained the money, she said that it was her own earnings for\r\n12 years, and those of Simeon, whom she was going to marry. The accused\r\nSimeon Kartinkin, when first examined, confessed that he and Botchkova,\r\nat the instigation of Maslova, who had come with the key from the\r\nbrothel, had stolen the money and divided it equally among themselves\r\nand Maslova." Here Maslova again started, half-rose from her seat, and,\r\nblushing scarlet, began to say something, but was stopped by the usher.\r\n"At last," the secretary continued, reading, "Kartinkin confessed also\r\nthat he had supplied the powders in order to get Smelkoff to sleep. When\r\nexamined the second time he denied having had anything to do with the\r\nstealing of the money or giving Maslova the powders, accusing her of\r\nhaving done it alone."\r\n\r\nConcerning the money placed in the bank by Botchkova, he said the same\r\nas she, that is, that the money was given to them both by the lodgers in\r\ntips during 12 years\' service.\r\n\r\nThe indictment concluded as follows:\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the foregoing, the peasant of the village Borki,\r\nSimeon Kartinkin, 33 years of age, the meschanka Euphemia Botchkova, 43\r\nyears of age, and the meschanka Katerina Maslova, 27 years of age, are\r\naccused of having on the 17th day of January, 188--, jointly stolen from\r\nthe said merchant, Smelkoff, a ring and money, to the value of 2,500\r\nroubles, and of having given the said merchant, Smelkoff, poison to\r\ndrink, with intent of depriving him of life, and thereby causing his\r\ndeath. This crime is provided for in clause 1,455 of the Penal Code,\r\nparagraphs 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--MASLOVA CROSS-EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading of the indictment was over, the president, after having\r\nconsulted the members, turned to Kartinkin, with an expression that\r\nplainly said: Now we shall find out the whole truth down to the minutest\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n"Peasant Simeon Kartinkin," he said, stooping to the left.\r\n\r\nSimeon Kartinkin got up, stretched his arms down his sides, and leaning\r\nforward with his whole body, continued moving his cheeks inaudibly.\r\n\r\n"You are accused of having on the 17th January, 188--, together with\r\nEuphemia Botchkova and Katerina Maslova, stolen money from a portmanteau\r\nbelonging to the merchant Smelkoff, and then, having procured some\r\narsenic, persuaded Katerina Maslova to give it to the merchant Smelkoff\r\nin a glass of brandy, which was the cause of Smelkoff\'s death. Do you\r\nplead guilty?" said the president, stooping to the right.\r\n\r\n"Not nohow, because our business is to attend on the lodgers, and--"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll tell us that afterwards. Do you plead guilty?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir. I only,--"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll tell us that afterwards. Do you plead guilty?" quietly and\r\nfirmly asked the president.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t do such a thing, because that--"\r\n\r\nThe usher again rushed up to Simeon Kartinkin, and stopped him in a\r\ntragic whisper.\r\n\r\nThe president moved the hand with which he held the paper and placed the\r\nelbow in a different position with an air that said: "This is finished,"\r\nand turned to Euphemia Botchkova.\r\n\r\n"Euphemia Botchkova, you are accused of having, on the 17th of January,\r\n188-, in the lodging-house Mauritania, together with Simeon Kartinkin\r\nand Katerina Maslova, stolen some money and a ring out of the merchant\r\nSmelkoff\'s portmanteau, and having shared the money among yourselves,\r\ngiven poison to the merchant Smelkoff, thereby causing his death. Do you\r\nplead guilty?"\r\n\r\n"I am not guilty of anything," boldly and firmly replied the prisoner.\r\n"I never went near the room, but when this baggage went in she did the\r\nwhole business."\r\n\r\n"You will say all this afterwards," the president again said, quietly\r\nand firmly. "So you do not plead guilty?"\r\n\r\n"I did not take the money nor give the drink, nor go into the room. Had\r\nI gone in I should have kicked her out."\r\n\r\n"So you do not plead guilty?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Very well."\r\n\r\n"Katerina Maslova," the president began, turning to the third prisoner,\r\n"you are accused of having come from the brothel with the key of the\r\nmerchant Smelkoff\'s portmanteau, money, and a ring." He said all this\r\nlike a lesson learned by heart, leaning towards the member on his left,\r\nwho was whispering into his ear that a bottle mentioned in the list\r\nof the material evidence was missing. "Of having stolen out of the\r\nportmanteau money and a ring," he repeated, "and shared it. Then,\r\nreturning to the lodging house Mauritania with Smelkoff, of giving\r\nhim poison in his drink, and thereby causing his death. Do you plead\r\nguilty?"\r\n\r\n"I am not guilty of anything," she began rapidly. "As I said before\r\nI say again, I did not take it--I did not take it; I did not take\r\nanything, and the ring he gave me himself."\r\n\r\n"You do not plead guilty of having stolen 2,500 roubles?" asked the\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve said I took nothing but the 40 roubles."\r\n\r\n"Well, and do you plead guilty of having given the merchant Smelkoff a\r\npowder in his drink?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that I did. Only I believed what they told me, that they were\r\nsleeping powders, and that no harm could come of them. I never thought,\r\nand never wished. . . God is my witness; I say, I never meant this," she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"So you do not plead guilty of having stolen the money and the ring from\r\nthe merchant Smelkoff, but confess that you gave him the powder?" said\r\nthe president.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, I do confess this, but I thought they were sleeping powders.\r\nI only gave them to make him sleep; I never meant and never thought of\r\nworse."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the president, evidently satisfied with the results\r\ngained. "Now tell us how it all happened," and he leaned back in his\r\nchair and put his folded hands on the table. "Tell us all about it. A\r\nfree and full confession will be to your advantage."\r\n\r\nMaslova continued to look at the president in silence, and blushing.\r\n\r\n"Tell us how it happened."\r\n\r\n"How it happened?" Maslova suddenly began, speaking quickly. "I came to\r\nthe lodging-house, and was shown into the room. He was there, already\r\nvery drunk." She pronounced the word _he_ with a look of horror in her\r\nwide-open eyes. "I wished to go away, but he would not let me." She\r\nstopped, as if having lost the thread, or remembered some thing else.\r\n\r\n"Well, and then?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what then? I remained a bit, and went home again."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the public prosecutor raised himself a little, leaning on\r\none elbow in an awkward manner.\r\n\r\n"You would like to put a question?" said the president, and having\r\nreceived an answer in the affirmative, he made a gesture inviting the\r\npublic prosecutor to speak.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask, was the prisoner previously acquainted with Simeon\r\nKartinkin?" said the public prosecutor, without looking at Maslova, and,\r\nhaving put the question, he compressed his lips and frowned.\r\n\r\nThe president repeated the question. Maslova stared at the public\r\nprosecutor, with a frightened look.\r\n\r\n"With Simeon? Yes," she said.\r\n\r\n"I should like to know what the prisoner\'s acquaintance with Kartinkin\r\nconsisted in. Did they meet often?"\r\n\r\n"Consisted in? . . . He invited me for the lodgers; it was not an\r\nacquaintance at all," answered Maslova, anxiously moving her eyes from\r\nthe president to the public prosecutor and back to the president.\r\n\r\n"I should like to know why Kartinkin invited only Maslova, and none\r\nof the other girls, for the lodgers?" said the public prosecutor, with\r\nhalf-closed eyes and a cunning, Mephistophelian smile.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. How should I know?" said Maslova, casting a frightened\r\nlook round, and fixing her eyes for a moment on Nekhludoff. "He asked\r\nwhom he liked."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that she has recognised me?" thought Nekhludoff, and the\r\nblood rushed to his face. But Maslova turned away without distinguishing\r\nhim from the others, and again fixed her eyes anxiously on the public\r\nprosecutor.\r\n\r\n"So the prisoner denies having had any intimate relations with\r\nKartinkin? Very well, I have no more questions to ask."\r\n\r\nAnd the public prosecutor took his elbow off the desk, and began writing\r\nsomething. He was not really noting anything down, but only going over\r\nthe letters of his notes with a pen, having seen the procureur and\r\nleading advocates, after putting a clever question, make a note, with\r\nwhich, later on, to annihilate their adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe president did not continue at once, because he was consulting the\r\nmember with the spectacles, whether he was agreed that the questions\r\n(which had all been prepared be forehand and written out) should be put.\r\n\r\n"Well! What happened next?" he then went on.\r\n\r\n"I came home," looking a little more boldly only at the president, "and\r\nwent to bed. Hardly had I fallen asleep when one of our girls, Bertha,\r\nwoke me. \'Go, your merchant has come again!\' He"--she again uttered the\r\nword _he_ with evident horror--"he kept treating our girls, and then\r\nwanted to send for more wine, but his money was all gone, and he sent me\r\nto his lodgings and told me where the money was, and how much to take.\r\nSo I went."\r\n\r\nThe president was whispering to the member on his left, but, in order to\r\nappear as if he had heard, he repeated her last words.\r\n\r\n"So you went. Well, what next?"\r\n\r\n"I went, and did all he told me; went into his room. I did not go alone,\r\nbut called Simeon Kartinkin and her," she said, pointing to Botchkova.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie; I never went in," Botchkova began, but was stopped.\r\n\r\n"In their presence I took out four notes," continued Maslova, frowning,\r\nwithout looking at Botchkova.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but did the prisoner notice," again asked the prosecutor, "how\r\nmuch money there was when she was getting out the 40 roubles?"\r\n\r\nMaslova shuddered when the prosecutor addressed her; she did not know\r\nwhy it was, but she felt that he wished her evil.\r\n\r\n"I did not count it, but only saw some 100-rouble notes."\r\n\r\n"Ah! The prisoner saw 100-rouble notes. That\'s all?"\r\n\r\n"Well, so you brought back the money," continued the president, looking\r\nat the clock.\r\n\r\n"I did."\r\n\r\n"Well, and then?"\r\n\r\n"Then he took me back with him," said Maslova.\r\n\r\n"Well, and how did you give him the powder? In his drink?"\r\n\r\n"How did I give it? I put them in and gave it him."\r\n\r\n"Why did you give it him?"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, but sighed deeply and heavily.\r\n\r\n"He would not let me go," she said, after a moment\'s silence, "and I was\r\nquite tired out, and so I went out into the passage and said to Simeon,\r\n\'If he would only let me go, I am so tired.\' And he said, \'We are also\r\nsick of him; we were thinking of giving him a sleeping draught; he will\r\nfall asleep, and then you can go.\' So I said all right. I thought they\r\nwere harmless, and he gave me the packet. I went in. He was lying behind\r\nthe partition, and at once called for brandy. I took a bottle of \'fine\r\nchampagne\' from the table, poured out two glasses, one for him and one\r\nfor myself, and put the powders into his glass, and gave it him. Had I\r\nknown how could I have given them to him?"\r\n\r\n"Well, and how did the ring come into your possession?" asked the\r\npresident. "When did he give it you?"\r\n\r\n"That was when we came back to his lodgings. I wanted to go away, and he\r\ngave me a knock on the head and broke my comb. I got angry and said I\'d\r\ngo away, and he took the ring off his finger and gave it to me so that I\r\nshould not go," she said.\r\n\r\nThen the public prosecutor again slightly raised himself, and, putting\r\non an air of simplicity, asked permission to put a few more questions,\r\nand, having received it, bending his head over his embroidered collar,\r\nhe said: "I should like to know how long the prisoner remained in the\r\nmerchant Smelkoff\'s room."\r\n\r\nMaslova again seemed frightened, and she again looked anxiously from the\r\npublic prosecutor to the president, and said hurriedly:\r\n\r\n"I do not remember how long."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but does the prisoner remember if she went anywhere else in the\r\nlodging-house after she left Smelkoff?"\r\n\r\nMaslova considered for a moment. "Yes, I did go into an empty room next\r\nto his."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and why did you go in?" asked the public prosecutor, forgetting\r\nhimself, and addressing her directly.\r\n\r\n"I went in to rest a bit, and to wait for an isvostchik."\r\n\r\n"And was Kartinkin in the room with the prisoner, or not?"\r\n\r\n"He came in."\r\n\r\n"Why did he come in?"\r\n\r\n"There was some of the merchant\'s brandy left, and we finished it\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"Oh, finished it together. Very well! And did the prisoner talk to\r\nKartinkin, and, if so, what about?"\r\n\r\nMaslova suddenly frowned, blushed very red, and said, hurriedly, "What\r\nabout? I did not talk about anything, and that\'s all I know. Do what you\r\nlike with me; I am not guilty, and that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing more to ask," said the prosecutor, and, drawing up his\r\nshoulders in an unnatural manner, began writing down, as the prisoner\'s\r\nown evidence, in the notes for his speech, that she had been in the\r\nempty room with Kartinkin.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence.\r\n\r\n"You have nothing more to say?"\r\n\r\n"I have told everything," she said, with a sigh, and sat down.\r\n\r\nThen the president noted something down, and, having listened to\r\nsomething that the member on his left whispered to him, he announced\r\na ten-minutes\' interval, rose hurriedly, and left the court. The\r\ncommunication he had received from the tall, bearded member with\r\nthe kindly eyes was that the member, having felt a slight stomach\r\nderangement, wished to do a little massage and to take some drops. And\r\nthis was why an interval was made.\r\n\r\nWhen the judges had risen, the advocates, the jury, and the witnesses\r\nalso rose, with the pleasant feeling that part of the business was\r\nfinished, and began moving in different directions.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went into the jury\'s room, and sat down by the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTWELVE YEARS BEFORE.\r\n\r\n"Yes, this was Katusha."\r\n\r\nThe relations between Nekhludoff and Katusha had been the following:\r\n\r\nNekhludoff first saw Katusha when he was a student in his third year\r\nat the University, and was preparing an essay on land tenure during\r\nthe summer vacation, which he passed with his aunts. Until then he had\r\nalways lived, in summer, with his mother and sister on his mother\'s\r\nlarge estate near Moscow. But that year his sister had married, and his\r\nmother had gone abroad to a watering-place, and he, having his essay to\r\nwrite, resolved to spend the summer with his aunts. It was very quiet\r\nin their secluded estate and there was nothing to distract his mind; his\r\naunts loved their nephew and heir very tenderly, and he, too, was fond\r\nof them and of their simple, old-fashioned life.\r\n\r\nDuring that summer on his aunts\' estate, Nekhludoff passed through that\r\nblissful state of existence when a young man for the first time, without\r\nguidance from any one outside, realises all the beauty and significance\r\nof life, and the importance of the task allotted in it to man; when he\r\ngrasps the possibility of unlimited advance towards perfection for one\'s\r\nself and for all the world, and gives himself to this task, not only\r\nhopefully, but with full conviction of attaining to the perfection\r\nhe imagines. In that year, while still at the University, he had read\r\nSpencer\'s Social Statics, and Spencer\'s views on landholding especially\r\nimpressed him, as he himself was heir to large estates. His father had\r\nnot been rich, but his mother had received 10,000 acres of land for her\r\ndowry. At that time he fully realised all the cruelty and injustice of\r\nprivate property in land, and being one of those to whom a sacrifice\r\nto the demands of conscience gives the highest spiritual enjoyment, he\r\ndecided not to retain property rights, but to give up to the peasant\r\nlabourers the land he had inherited from his father. It was on this land\r\nquestion he wrote his essay.\r\n\r\nHe arranged his life on his aunts\' estate in the following manner. He\r\ngot up very early, sometimes at three o\'clock, and before sunrise went\r\nthrough the morning mists to bathe in the river, under the hill.\r\nHe returned while the dew still lay on the grass and the flowers.\r\nSometimes, having finished his coffee, he sat down with his books of\r\nreference and his papers to write his essay, but very often, instead of\r\nreading or writing, he left home again, and wandered through the fields\r\nand the woods. Before dinner he lay down and slept somewhere in the\r\ngarden. At dinner he amused and entertained his aunts with his bright\r\nspirits, then he rode on horseback or went for a row on the river, and\r\nin the evening he again worked at his essay, or sat reading or playing\r\npatience with his aunts.\r\n\r\nHis joy in life was so great that it agitated him, and kept him awake\r\nmany a night, especially when it was moonlight, so that instead of\r\nsleeping he wandered about in the garden till dawn, alone with his\r\ndreams and fancies.\r\n\r\nAnd so, peacefully and happily, he lived through the first month of his\r\nstay with his aunts, taking no particular notice of their half-ward,\r\nhalf-servant, the black-eyed, quick-footed Katusha. Then, at the age\r\nof nineteen, Nekhludoff, brought up under his mother\'s wing, was still\r\nquite pure. If a woman figured in his dreams at all it was only as a\r\nwife. All the other women, who, according to his ideas he could not\r\nmarry, were not women for him, but human beings.\r\n\r\nBut on Ascension Day that summer, a neighbour of his aunts\', and her\r\nfamily, consisting of two young daughters, a schoolboy, and a young\r\nartist of peasant origin who was staying with them, came to spend the\r\nday. After tea they all went to play in the meadow in front of the\r\nhouse, where the grass had already been mown. They played at the game\r\nof gorelki, and Katusha joined them. Running about and changing partners\r\nseveral times, Nekhludoff caught Katusha, and she became his partner.\r\nUp to this time he had liked Katusha\'s looks, but the possibility of any\r\nnearer relations with her had never entered his mind.\r\n\r\n"Impossible to catch those two," said the merry young artist, whose turn\r\nit was to catch, and who could run very fast with his short, muscular\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n"You! And not catch us?" said Katusha.\r\n\r\n"One, two, three," and the artist clapped his hands. Katusha, hardly\r\nrestraining her laughter, changed places with Nekhludoff, behind the\r\nartist\'s back, and pressing his large hand with her little rough one,\r\nand rustling with her starched petticoat, ran to the left. Nekhludoff\r\nran fast to the right, trying to escape from the artist, but when he\r\nlooked round he saw the artist running after Katusha, who kept well\r\nahead, her firm young legs moving rapidly. There was a lilac bush in\r\nfront of them, and Katusha made a sign with her head to Nekhludoff to\r\njoin her behind it, for if they once clasped hands again they were safe\r\nfrom their pursuer, that being a rule of the game. He understood the\r\nsign, and ran behind the bush, but he did not know that there was a\r\nsmall ditch overgrown with nettles there. He stumbled and fell into the\r\nnettles, already wet with dew, stinging his bands, but rose immediately,\r\nlaughing at his mishap.\r\n\r\nKatusha, with her eyes black as sloes, her face radiant with joy, was\r\nflying towards him, and they caught hold of each other\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"Got stung, I daresay?" she said, arranging her hair with her free hand,\r\nbreathing fast and looking straight up at him with a glad, pleasant\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"I did not know there was a ditch here," he answered, smiling also, and\r\nkeeping her hand in his. She drew nearer to him, and he himself, not\r\nknowing how it happened, stooped towards her. She did not move away, and\r\nhe pressed her hand tight and kissed her on the lips.\r\n\r\n"There! You\'ve done it!" she said; and, freeing her hand with a swift\r\nmovement, ran away from him. Then, breaking two branches of white lilac\r\nfrom which the blossoms were already falling, she began fanning her hot\r\nface with them; then, with her head turned back to him, she walked away,\r\nswaying her arms briskly in front of her, and joined the other players.\r\n\r\nAfter this there grew up between Nekhludoff and Katusha those peculiar\r\nrelations which often exist between a pure young man and girl who are\r\nattracted to each other.\r\n\r\nWhen Katusha came into the room, or even when he saw her white apron\r\nfrom afar, everything brightened up in Nekhludoff\'s eyes, as when the\r\nsun appears everything becomes more interesting, more joyful, more\r\nimportant. The whole of life seemed full of gladness. And she felt the\r\nsame. But it was not only Katusha\'s presence that had this effect on\r\nNekhludoff. The mere thought that Katusha existed (and for her that\r\nNekhludoff existed) had this effect.\r\n\r\nWhen he received an unpleasant letter from his mother, or could not get\r\non with his essay, or felt the unreasoning sadness that young people are\r\noften subject to, he had only to remember Katusha and that he should see\r\nher, and it all vanished. Katusha had much work to do in the house, but\r\nshe managed to get a little leisure for reading, and Nekhludoff gave her\r\nDostoievsky and Tourgeneff (whom he had just read himself) to read. She\r\nliked Tourgeneff\'s Lull best. They had talks at moments snatched when\r\nmeeting in the passage, on the veranda, or the yard, and sometimes\r\nin the room of his aunts\' old servant, Matrona Pavlovna, with whom he\r\nsometimes used to drink tea, and where Katusha used to work.\r\n\r\nThese talks in Matrona Pavlovna\'s presence were the pleasantest. When\r\nthey were alone it was worse. Their eyes at once began to say something\r\nvery different and far more important than what their mouths uttered.\r\nTheir lips puckered, and they felt a kind of dread of something that\r\nmade them part quickly. These relations continued between Nekhludoff\r\nand Katusha during the whole time of his first visit to his aunts\'.\r\nThey noticed it, and became frightened, and even wrote to Princess\r\nElena Ivanovna, Nekhludoff\'s mother. His aunt, Mary Ivanovna, was\r\nafraid Dmitri would form an intimacy with Katusha; but her fears were\r\ngroundless, for Nekhludoff, himself hardly conscious of it, loved\r\nKatusha, loved her as the pure love, and therein lay his safety--his and\r\nhers. He not only did not feel any desire to possess her, but the very\r\nthought of it filled him with horror. The fears of the more poetical\r\nSophia Ivanovna, that Dmitri, with his thoroughgoing, resolute\r\ncharacter, having fallen in love with a girl, might make up his mind to\r\nmarry her, without considering either her birth or her station, had more\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHad Nekhludoff at that time been conscious of his love for Katusha, and\r\nespecially if he had been told that he could on no account join his life\r\nwith that of a girl in her position, it might have easily happened\r\nthat, with his usual straight-forwardness, he would have come to the\r\nconclusion that there could be no possible reason for him not to marry\r\nany girl whatever, as long as he loved her. But his aunts did not\r\nmention their fears to him; and, when he left, he was still unconscious\r\nof his love for Katusha. He was sure that what he felt for Katusha was\r\nonly one of the manifestations of the joy of life that filled his whole\r\nbeing, and that this sweet, merry little girl shared this joy with him.\r\nYet, when he was going away, and Katusha stood with his aunts in the\r\nporch, and looked after him, her dark, slightly-squinting eyes filled\r\nwith tears, he felt, after all, that he was leaving something beautiful,\r\nprecious, something which would never reoccur. And he grew very sad.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Katusha," he said, looking across Sophia Ivanovna\'s cap as he\r\nwas getting into the trap. "Thank you for everything."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Dmitri Ivanovitch," she said, with her pleasant, tender\r\nvoice, keeping back the tears that filled her eyes--and ran away into\r\nthe hall, where she could cry in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nAfter that Nekhludoff did not see Katusha for more than three years.\r\nWhen he saw her again he had just been promoted to the rank of officer\r\nand was going to join his regiment. On the way he came to spend a few\r\ndays with his aunts, being now a very different young man from the one\r\nwho had spent the summer with them three years before. He then had been\r\nan honest, unselfish lad, ready to sacrifice himself for any good cause;\r\nnow he was depraved and selfish, and thought only of his own enjoyment.\r\nThen God\'s world seemed a mystery which he tried enthusiastically and\r\njoyfully to solve; now everything in life seemed clear and simple,\r\ndefined by the conditions of the life he was leading. Then he had felt\r\nthe importance of, and had need of intercourse with, nature, and with\r\nthose who had lived and thought and felt before him--philosophers\r\nand poets. What he now considered necessary and important were human\r\ninstitutions and intercourse with his comrades. Then women seemed\r\nmysterious and charming--charming by the very mystery that enveloped\r\nthem; now the purpose of women, all women except those of his own family\r\nand the wives of his friends, was a very definite one: women were the\r\nbest means towards an already experienced enjoyment. Then money was not\r\nneeded, and he did not require even one-third of what his mother allowed\r\nhim; but now this allowance of 1,500 roubles a month did not suffice,\r\nand he had already had some unpleasant talks about it with his mother.\r\n\r\nThen he had looked on his spirit as the I; now it was his healthy strong\r\nanimal I that he looked upon as himself.\r\n\r\nAnd all this terrible change had come about because he had ceased to\r\nbelieve himself and had taken to believing others. This he had done\r\nbecause it was too difficult to live believing one\'s self; believing\r\none\'s self, one had to decide every question not in favour of one\'s own\r\nanimal life, which is always seeking for easy gratifications, but almost\r\nin every case against it. Believing others there was nothing to decide;\r\neverything had been decided already, and decided always in favour of the\r\nanimal I and against the spiritual. Nor was this all. Believing in his\r\nown self he was always exposing himself to the censure of those around\r\nhim; believing others he had their approval. So, when Nekhludoff had\r\ntalked of the serious matters of life, of God, truth, riches, and\r\npoverty, all round him thought it out of place and even rather funny,\r\nand his mother and aunts called him, with kindly irony, notre cher\r\nphilosophe. But when he read novels, told improper anecdotes, went\r\nto see funny vaudevilles in the French theatre and gaily repeated the\r\njokes, everybody admired and encouraged him. When he considered it\r\nright to limit his needs, wore an old overcoat, took no wine, everybody\r\nthought it strange and looked upon it as a kind of showing off; but\r\nwhen he spent large sums on hunting, or on furnishing a peculiar and\r\nluxurious study for himself, everybody admired his taste and gave him\r\nexpensive presents to encourage his hobby. While he kept pure and meant\r\nto remain so till he married his friends prayed for his health, and even\r\nhis mother was not grieved but rather pleased when she found out that\r\nhe had become a real man and had gained over some French woman from his\r\nfriend. (As to the episode with Katusha, the princess could not without\r\nhorror think that he might possibly have married her.) In the same way,\r\nwhen Nekhludoff came of age, and gave the small estate he had inherited\r\nfrom his father to the peasants because he considered the holding\r\nof private property in land wrong, this step filled his mother and\r\nrelations with dismay and served as an excuse for making fun of him to\r\nall his relatives. He was continually told that these peasants, after\r\nthey had received the land, got no richer, but, on the contrary, poorer,\r\nhaving opened three public-houses and left off doing any work. But when\r\nNekhludoff entered the Guards and spent and gambled away so much with\r\nhis aristocratic companions that Elena Ivanovna, his mother, had to draw\r\non her capital, she was hardly pained, considering it quite natural\r\nand even good that wild oats should be sown at an early age and in good\r\ncompany, as her son was doing. At first Nekhludoff struggled, but all\r\nthat he had considered good while he had faith in himself was considered\r\nbad by others, and what he had considered evil was looked upon as good\r\nby those among whom he lived, and the struggle grew too hard. And at\r\nlast Nekhludoff gave in, i.e., left off believing himself and began\r\nbelieving others. At first this giving up of faith in himself was\r\nunpleasant, but it did not long continue to be so. At that time he\r\nacquired the habit of smoking, and drinking wine, and soon got over this\r\nunpleasant feeling and even felt great relief.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff, with his passionate nature, gave himself thoroughly to the\r\nnew way of life so approved of by all those around, and he entirely\r\nstifled the inner voice which demanded something different. This began\r\nafter he moved to St. Petersburg, and reached its highest point when he\r\nentered the army.\r\n\r\nMilitary life in general depraves men. It places them in conditions of\r\ncomplete idleness, i.e., absence of all useful work; frees them of their\r\ncommon human duties, which it replaces by merely conventional ones to\r\nthe honour of the regiment, the uniform, the flag; and, while giving\r\nthem on the one hand absolute power over other men, also puts them into\r\nconditions of servile obedience to those of higher rank than themselves.\r\n\r\nBut when, to the usual depraving influence of military service with its\r\nhonours, uniforms, flags, its permitted violence and murder, there is\r\nadded the depraving influence of riches and nearness to and intercourse\r\nwith members of the Imperial family, as is the case in the chosen\r\nregiment of the Guards in which all the officers are rich and of good\r\nfamily, then this depraving influence creates in the men who succumb\r\nto it a perfect mania of selfishness. And this mania of selfishness\r\nattacked Nekhludoff from the moment he entered the army and began living\r\nin the way his companions lived. He had no occupation whatever except\r\nto dress in a uniform, splendidly made and well brushed by other people,\r\nand, with arms also made and cleaned and handed to him by others, ride\r\nto reviews on a fine horse which had been bred, broken in and fed by\r\nothers. There, with other men like himself, he had to wave a sword,\r\nshoot off guns, and teach others to do the same. He had no other work,\r\nand the highly-placed persons, young and old, the Tsar and those near\r\nhim, not only sanctioned his occupation but praised and thanked him for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter this was done, it was thought important to eat, and particularly\r\nto drink, in officers\' clubs or the salons of the best restaurants,\r\nsquandering large sums of money, which came from some invisible source;\r\nthen theatres, ballets, women, then again riding on horseback, waving\r\nof swords and shooting, and again the squandering of money, the wine,\r\ncards, and women. This kind of life acts on military men even more\r\ndepravingly than on others, because if any other than a military man\r\nlead such a life he cannot help being ashamed of it in the depth of his\r\nheart. A military man is, on the contrary, proud of a life of this kind\r\nespecially at war time, and Nekhludoff had entered the army just after\r\nwar with the Turks had been declared. "We are prepared to sacrifice\r\nour lives at the wars, and therefore a gay, reckless life is not only\r\npardonable, but absolutely necessary for us, and so we lead it."\r\n\r\nSuch were Nekhludoff\'s confused thoughts at this period of his\r\nexistence, and he felt all the time the delight of being free of the\r\nmoral barriers he had formerly set himself. And the state he lived in\r\nwas that of a chronic mania of selfishness. He was in this state when,\r\nafter three years\' absence, he came again to visit his aunts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND MEETING WITH MASLOVA.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went to visit his aunts because their estate lay near the\r\nroad he had to travel in order to join his regiment, which had gone\r\nforward, because they had very warmly asked him to come, and especially\r\nbecause he wanted to see Katusha. Perhaps in his heart he had already\r\nformed those evil designs against Katusha which his now uncontrolled\r\nanimal self suggested to him, but he did not acknowledge this as his\r\nintention, but only wished to go back to the spot where he had been so\r\nhappy, to see his rather funny, but dear, kind-hearted old aunts, who\r\nalways, without his noticing it, surrounded him with an atmosphere of\r\nlove and admiration, and to see sweet Katusha, of whom he had retained\r\nso pleasant a memory.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the end of March, on Good Friday, after the thaw had set\r\nin. It was pouring with rain so that he had not a dry thread on him and\r\nwas feeling very cold, but yet vigorous and full of spirits, as always\r\nat that time. "Is she still with them?" he thought, as he drove into the\r\nfamiliar, old-fashioned courtyard, surrounded by a low brick wall, and\r\nnow filled with snow off the roofs.\r\n\r\nHe expected she would come out when she heard the sledge bells but she\r\ndid not. Two bare-footed women with pails and tucked-up skirts, who had\r\nevidently been scrubbing the floors, came out of the side door. She was\r\nnot at the front door either, and only Tikhon, the man-servant, with his\r\napron on, evidently also busy cleaning, came out into the front porch.\r\nHis aunt Sophia Ivanovna alone met him in the ante-room; she had a silk\r\ndress on and a cap on her head. Both aunts had been to church and had\r\nreceived communion.\r\n\r\n"Well, this is nice of you to come," said Sophia Ivanovna, kissing him.\r\n"Mary is not well, got tired in church; we have been to communion."\r\n\r\n"I congratulate you, Aunt Sophia," [it is usual in Russia to\r\ncongratulate those who have received communion] said Nekhludoff, kissing\r\nSophia Ivanovna\'s hand. "Oh, I beg your pardon, I have made you wet."\r\n\r\n"Go to your room--why you are soaking wet. Dear me, you have got\r\nmoustaches! . . . Katusha! Katusha! Get him some coffee; be quick."\r\n\r\n"Directly," came the sound of a well-known, pleasant voice from the\r\npassage, and Nekhludoff\'s heart cried out "She\'s here!" and it was as if\r\nthe sun had come out from behind the clouds.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff, followed by Tikhon, went gaily to his old room to change his\r\nthings. He felt inclined to ask Tikhon about Katusha; how she was,\r\nwhat she was doing, was she not going to be married? But Tikhon was so\r\nrespectful and at the same time so severe, insisted so firmly on pouring\r\nthe water out of the jug for him, that Nekhludoff could not make up\r\nhis mind to ask him about Katusha, but only inquired about Tikhon\'s\r\ngrandsons, about the old so-called "brother\'s" horse, and about the\r\ndog Polkan. All were alive except Polkan, who had gone mad the summer\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhen he had taken off all his wet things and just begun to dress again,\r\nNekhludoff heard quick, familiar footsteps and a knock at the door.\r\nNekhludoff knew the steps and also the knock. No one but she walked and\r\nknocked like that.\r\n\r\nHaving thrown his wet greatcoat over his shoulders, he opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Come in." It was she, Katusha, the same, only sweeter than before. The\r\nslightly squinting naive black eyes looked up in the same old way. Now\r\nas then, she had on a white apron. She brought him from his aunts\r\na piece of scented soap, with the wrapper just taken off, and two\r\ntowels--one a long Russian embroidered one, the other a bath towel. The\r\nunused soap with the stamped inscription, the towels, and her own self,\r\nall were equally clean, fresh, undefiled and pleasant. The irrepressible\r\nsmile of joy at the sight of him made the sweet, firm lips pucker up as\r\nof old.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Dmitri Ivanovitch?" she uttered with difficulty, her\r\nface suffused with a rosy blush.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning! How do you do?" he said, also blushing. "Alive and well?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the Lord be thanked. And here is your favorite pink soap and\r\ntowels from your aunts," she said, putting the soap on the table and\r\nhanging the towels over the back of a chair.\r\n\r\n"There is everything here," said Tikhon, defending the visitor\'s\r\nindependence, and pointing to Nekhludoff\'s open dressing case filled\r\nwith brushes, perfume, fixatoire, a great many bottles with silver lids\r\nand all sorts of toilet appliances.\r\n\r\n"Thank my aunts, please. Oh, how glad I am to be here," said Nekhludoff,\r\nhis heart filling with light and tenderness as of old.\r\n\r\nShe only smiled in answer to these words, and went out. The aunts, who\r\nhad always loved Nekhludoff, welcomed him this time more warmly than\r\never. Dmitri was going to the war, where he might be wounded or killed,\r\nand this touched the old aunts. Nekhludoff had arranged to stay only a\r\nday and night with his aunts, but when he had seen Katusha he agreed to\r\nstay over Easter with them and telegraphed to his friend Schonbock, whom\r\nhe was to have joined in Odessa, that he should come and meet him at his\r\naunts\' instead.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had seen Katusha Nekhludoff\'s old feelings toward her\r\nawoke again. Now, just as then, he could not see her white apron without\r\ngetting excited; he could not listen to her steps, her voice, her laugh,\r\nwithout a feeling of joy; he could not look at her eyes, black as sloes,\r\nwithout a feeling of tenderness, especially when she smiled; and, above\r\nall, he could not notice without agitation how she blushed when they\r\nmet. He felt he was in love, but not as before, when this love was a\r\nkind of mystery to him and he would not own, even to himself, that he\r\nloved, and when he was persuaded that one could love only once; now he\r\nknew he was in love and was glad of it, and knew dimly what this love\r\nconsisted of and what it might lead to, though he sought to conceal\r\nit even from himself. In Nekhludoff, as in every man, there were two\r\nbeings: one the spiritual, seeking only that kind of happiness for him\r\nself which should tend towards the happiness of all; the other, the\r\nanimal man, seeking only his own happiness, and ready to sacrifice to it\r\nthe happiness of the rest of the world. At this period of his mania of\r\nself-love brought on by life in Petersburg and in the army, this animal\r\nman ruled supreme and completely crushed the spiritual man in him.\r\n\r\nBut when he saw Katusha and experienced the same feelings as he had had\r\nthree years before, the spiritual man in him raised its head once more\r\nand began to assert its rights. And up to Easter, during two whole days,\r\nan unconscious, ceaseless inner struggle went on in him.\r\n\r\nHe knew in the depths of his soul that he ought to go away, that there\r\nwas no real reason for staying on with his aunts, knew that no good\r\ncould come of it; and yet it was so pleasant, so delightful, that he did\r\nnot honestly acknowledge the facts to himself and stayed on. On Easter\r\neve, the priest and the deacon who came to the house to say mass had had\r\n(so they said) the greatest difficulty in getting over the three miles\r\nthat lay between the church and the old ladies\' house, coming across the\r\npuddles and the bare earth in a sledge.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff attended the mass with his aunts and the servants, and kept\r\nlooking at Katusha, who was near the door and brought in the censers\r\nfor the priests. Then having given the priests and his aunts the Easter\r\nkiss, though it was not midnight and therefore not Easter yet, he was\r\nalready going to bed when he heard the old servant Matrona Pavlovna\r\npreparing to go to the church to get the koulitch and paski [Easter\r\ncakes] blest after the midnight service. "I shall go too," he thought.\r\n\r\nThe road to the church was impassable either in a sledge or on wheels,\r\nso Nekhludoff, who behaved in his aunts\' house just as he did at home,\r\nordered the old horse, "the brother\'s horse," to be saddled, and instead\r\nof going to bed he put on his gay uniform, a pair of tight-fitting\r\nriding breeches and his overcoat, and got on the old over-fed and heavy\r\nhorse, which neighed continually all the way as he rode in the dark\r\nthrough the puddles and snow to the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY MASS.\r\n\r\nFor Nekhludoff this early mass remained for ever after one of the\r\nbrightest and most vivid memories of his life. When he rode out of the\r\ndarkness, broken only here and there by patches of white snow, into the\r\nchurchyard illuminated by a row of lamps around the church, the service\r\nhad already begun.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, recognising Mary Ivanovna\'s nephew, led his horse, which\r\nwas pricking up its ears at the sight of the lights, to a dry place\r\nwhere he could get off, put it up for him, and showed him into the\r\nchurch, which was full of people. On the right stood the peasants; the\r\nold men in home-spun coats, and clean white linen bands [long strips of\r\nlinen are worn by the peasants instead of stockings] wrapped round their\r\nlegs, the young men in new cloth coats, bright-coloured belts round\r\ntheir waists, and top-boots.\r\n\r\nOn the left stood the women, with red silk kerchiefs on their\r\nheads, black velveteen sleeveless jackets, bright red shirt-sleeves,\r\ngay-coloured green, blue, and red skirts, and thick leather boots.\r\nThe old women, dressed more quietly, stood behind them, with white\r\nkerchiefs, homespun coats, old-fashioned skirts of dark home-spun\r\nmaterial, and shoes on their feet. Gaily-dressed children, their hair\r\nwell oiled, went in and out among them.\r\n\r\nThe men, making the sign of the cross, bowed down and raised their heads\r\nagain, shaking back their hair.\r\n\r\nThe women, especially the old ones, fixed their eyes on an icon\r\nsurrounded with candies and made the sign of the cross, firmly pressing\r\ntheir folded fingers to the kerchief on their foreheads, to their\r\nshoulders, and their stomachs, and, whispering something, stooped\r\nor knelt down. The children, imitating the grown-up people, prayed\r\nearnestly when they knew that they were being observed. The gilt case\r\ncontaining the icon glittered, illuminated on all sides by tall candles\r\nornamented with golden spirals. The candelabra was filled with tapers,\r\nand from the choir sounded most merry tunes sung by amateur choristers,\r\nwith bellowing bass and shrill boys\' voices among them.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff passed up to the front. In the middle of the church stood\r\nthe aristocracy of the place: a landed proprietor, with his wife and\r\nson (the latter dressed in a sailor\'s suit), the police officer, the\r\ntelegraph clerk, a tradesman in top-boots, and the village elder, with\r\na medal on his breast; and to the right of the ambo, just behind the\r\nlanded proprietor\'s wife, stood Matrona Pavlovna in a lilac dress and\r\nfringed shawl and Katusha in a white dress with a tucked bodice, blue\r\nsash, and red bow in her black hair.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed festive, solemn, bright, and beautiful: the priest in\r\nhis silver cloth vestments with gold crosses; the deacon, the clerk and\r\nchanter in their silver and gold surplices; the amateur choristers in\r\ntheir best clothes, with their well-oiled hair; the merry tunes of the\r\nholiday hymns that sounded like dance music; and the continual blessing\r\nof the people by the priests, who held candles decorated with flowers,\r\nand repeated the cry of "Christ is risen!" "Christ is risen!" All was\r\nbeautiful; but, above all, Katusha, in her white dress, blue sash, and\r\nthe red bow on her black head, her eyes beaming with rapture.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff knew that she felt his presence without looking at him. He\r\nnoticed this as he passed her, walking up to the altar. He had nothing\r\nto tell her, but he invented something to say and whispered as he passed\r\nher: "Aunt told me that she would break her fast after the late mass."\r\nThe young blood rushed up to Katusha\'s sweet face, as it always did\r\nwhen she looked at him. The black eyes, laughing and full of joy, gazed\r\nnaively up and remained fixed on Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"I know," she said, with a smile.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the clerk was going out with a copper coffee-pot\r\n[coffee-pots are often used for holding holy water in Russia] of holy\r\nwater in his hand, and, not noticing Katusha, brushed her with his\r\nsurplice. Evidently he brushed against Katusha through wishing to pass\r\nNekhludoff at a respectful distance, and Nekhludoff was surprised that\r\nhe, the clerk, did not understand that everything here, yes, and in\r\nall the world, only existed for Katusha, and that everything else might\r\nremain unheeded, only not she, because she was the centre of all. For\r\nher the gold glittered round the icons; for her all these candles in\r\ncandelabra and candlesticks were alight; for her were sung these\r\njoyful hymns, "Behold the Passover of the Lord" "Rejoice, O ye people!"\r\nAll--all that was good in the world was for her. And it seemed to him\r\nthat Katusha was aware that it was all for her when he looked at her\r\nwell-shaped figure, the tucked white dress, the wrapt, joyous expression\r\nof her face, by which he knew that just exactly the same that was\r\nsinging in his own soul was also singing in hers.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the early and the late mass Nekhludoff left the\r\nchurch. The people stood aside to let him pass, and bowed. Some knew\r\nhim; others asked who he was.\r\n\r\nHe stopped on the steps. The beggars standing there came clamouring\r\nround him, and he gave them all the change he had in his purse and went\r\ndown. It was dawning, but the sun had not yet risen. The people grouped\r\nround the graves in the churchyard. Katusha had remained inside.\r\nNekhludoff stood waiting for her.\r\n\r\nThe people continued coming out, clattering with their nailed boots on\r\nthe stone steps and dispersing over the churchyard. A very old man with\r\nshaking head, his aunts\' cook, stopped Nekhludoff in order to give\r\nhim the Easter kiss, his old wife took an egg, dyed yellow, out of her\r\nhandkerchief and gave it to Nekhludoff, and a smiling young peasant in a\r\nnew coat and green belt also came up.\r\n\r\n"Christ is risen," he said, with laughing eyes, and coming close to\r\nNekhludoff he enveloped him in his peculiar but pleasant peasant smell,\r\nand, tickling him with his curly beard, kissed him three times straight\r\non the mouth with his firm, fresh lips.\r\n\r\nWhile the peasant was kissing Nekhludoff and giving him a dark brown\r\negg, the lilac dress of Matrona Pavlovna and the dear black head with\r\nthe red bow appeared.\r\n\r\nKatusha caught sight of him over the heads of those in front of her, and\r\nhe saw how her face brightened up.\r\n\r\nShe had come out with Matrona Pavlovna on to the porch, and stopped\r\nthere distributing alms to the beggars. A beggar with a red scab in\r\nplace of a nose came up to Katusha. She gave him something, drew nearer\r\nhim, and, evincing no sign of disgust, but her eyes still shining with\r\njoy, kissed him three times. And while she was doing this her eyes met\r\nNekhludoff\'s with a look as if she were asking, "Is this that I am doing\r\nright?" "Yes, dear, yes, it is right; everything is right, everything is\r\nbeautiful. I love!"\r\n\r\nThey came down the steps of the porch, and he came up to them.\r\n\r\nHe did not mean to give them the Easter kiss, but only to be nearer to\r\nher. Matrona Pavlovna bowed her head, and said with a smile, "Christ is\r\nrisen!" and her tone implied, "To-day we are all equal." She wiped her\r\nmouth with her handkerchief rolled into a ball and stretched her lips\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n"He is, indeed," answered Nekhludoff, kissing her. Then he looked\r\nat Katusha; she blushed, and drew nearer. "Christ is risen, Dmitri\r\nIvanovitch."\r\n\r\n"He is risen, indeed," answered Nekhludoff, and they kissed twice, then\r\npaused as if considering whether a third kiss were necessary, and,\r\nhaving decided that it was, kissed a third time and smiled.\r\n\r\n"You are going to the priests?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No, we shall sit out here a bit, Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Katusha with\r\neffort, as if she had accomplished some joyous task, and, her whole\r\nchest heaving with a deep sigh, she looked straight in his face with\r\na look of devotion, virgin purity, and love, in her very slightly\r\nsquinting eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the love between a man and a woman there always comes a moment when\r\nthis love has reached its zenith--a moment when it is unconscious,\r\nunreasoning, and with nothing sensual about it. Such a moment had come\r\nfor Nekhludoff on that Easter eve. When he brought Katusha back to his\r\nmind, now, this moment veiled all else; the smooth glossy black head,\r\nthe white tucked dress closely fitting her graceful maidenly form, her,\r\nas yet, un-developed bosom, the blushing cheeks, the tender shining\r\nblack eyes with their slight squint heightened by the sleepless night,\r\nand her whole being stamped with those two marked features, purity and\r\nchaste love, love not only for him (he knew that), but for everybody and\r\neverything, not for the good alone, but for all that is in the world,\r\neven for that beggar whom she had kissed.\r\n\r\nHe knew she had that love in her because on that night and morning\r\nhe was conscious of it in himself, and conscious that in this love he\r\nbecame one with her. Ah! if it had all stopped there, at the point it\r\nhad reached that night. "Yes, all that horrible business had not yet\r\nhappened on that Easter eve!" he thought, as he sat by the window of the\r\njurymen\'s room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STEP.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned from church Nekhludoff broke the fast with his aunts\r\nand took a glass of spirits and some wine, having got into that habit\r\nwhile with his regiment, and when he reached his room fell asleep at\r\nonce, dressed as he was. He was awakened by a knock at the door. He knew\r\nit was her knock, and got up, rubbing his eyes and stretching himself.\r\n\r\n"Katusha, is it you? Come in," said he.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Dinner is ready," she said. She still had on the same white dress, but\r\nnot the bow in her hair. She looked at him with a smile, as if she had\r\ncommunicated some very good news to him.\r\n\r\n"I am coming," he answered, as he rose, taking his comb to arrange his\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nShe stood still for a minute, and he, noticing it, threw down his comb\r\nand made a step towards her, but at that very moment she turned suddenly\r\nand went with quick light steps along the strip of carpet in the middle\r\nof the passage.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, what a fool I am," thought Nekhludoff. "Why did I not stop\r\nher?" What he wanted her for he did not know himself, but he felt that\r\nwhen she came into his room something should have been done, something\r\nthat is generally done on such occasions, and that he had left it\r\nundone.\r\n\r\n"Katusha, wait," he said.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" she said, stopping.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, only--" and, with an effort, remembering how men in his\r\nposition generally behave, he put his arm round her waist.\r\n\r\nShe stood still and looked into his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Dmitri Ivanovitch, you must not," she said, blushing to tears\r\nand pushing away his arm with her strong hard hand. Nekhludoff let her\r\ngo, and for a moment he felt not only confused and ashamed but disgusted\r\nwith himself. He should now have believed himself, and then he would\r\nhave known that this confusion and shame were caused by the best\r\nfeelings of his soul demanding to be set free; but he thought it was\r\nonly his stupidity and that he ought to behave as every one else did. He\r\ncaught her up and kissed her on the neck.\r\n\r\nThis kiss was very different from that first thoughtless kiss behind\r\nthe lilac bush, and very different to the kiss this morning in the\r\nchurchyard. This was a dreadful kiss, and she felt it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what are you doing?" she cried, in a tone as if he had irreparably\r\nbroken something of priceless value, and ran quickly away.\r\n\r\nHe came into the dining-room. His aunts, elegantly dressed, their family\r\ndoctor, and a neighbour were already there. Everything seemed so very\r\nordinary, but in Nekhludoff a storm was raging. He understood nothing\r\nof what was being said and gave wrong answers, thinking only of Katusha.\r\nThe sound of her steps in the passage brought back the thrill of that\r\nlast kiss and he could think of nothing else. When she came into the\r\nroom he, without looking round, felt her presence with his whole being\r\nand had to force himself not to look at her.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he at once went into his bedroom and for a long time walked\r\nup and down in great excitement, listening to every sound in the house\r\nand expecting to hear her steps. The animal man inside him had now not\r\nonly lifted its head, but had succeeded in trampling under foot the\r\nspiritual man of the days of his first visit, and even of that every\r\nmorning. That dreadful animal man alone now ruled over him.\r\n\r\nThough he was watching for her all day he could not manage to meet her\r\nalone. She was probably trying to evade him. In the evening, however,\r\nshe was obliged to go into the room next to his. The doctor had been\r\nasked to stay the night, and she had to make his bed. When he heard her\r\ngo in Nekhludoff followed her, treading softly and holding his breath as\r\nif he were going to commit a crime.\r\n\r\nShe was putting a clean pillow-case on the pillow, holding it by two of\r\nits corners with her arms inside the pillow-case. She turned round\r\nand smiled, not a happy, joyful smile as before, but in a frightened,\r\npiteous way. The smile seemed to tell him that what he was doing was\r\nwrong. He stopped for a moment. There was still the possibility of a\r\nstruggle. The voice of his real love for her, though feebly, was still\r\nspeaking of her, her feelings, her life. Another voice was saying,\r\n"Take care I don\'t let the opportunity for your own happiness, your own\r\nenjoyment, slip by!" And this second voice completely stifled the first.\r\nHe went up to her with determination and a terrible, ungovernable animal\r\npassion took possession of him.\r\n\r\nWith his arm round he made her sit down on the bed; and feeling that\r\nthere was something more to be done he sat down beside her.\r\n\r\n"Dmitri Ivanovitch, dear! please let me go," she said, with a piteous\r\nvoice. "Matrona Pavlovna is coming," she cried, tearing herself away.\r\nSome one was really coming to the door.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I\'ll come to you in the night," he whispered. "You\'ll be\r\nalone?"\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of? On no account. No, no!" she said, but only\r\nwith her lips; the tremulous confusion of her whole being said something\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\nIt was Matrona Pavlovna who had come to the door. She came in with a\r\nblanket over her arm, looked reproachfully at Nekhludoff, and began\r\nscolding Katusha for having taken the wrong blanket.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went out in silence, but he did not even feel ashamed. He\r\ncould see by Matrona Pavlovna\'s face that she was blaming him, he knew\r\nthat she was blaming him with reason and felt that he was doing wrong,\r\nbut this novel, low animal excitement, having freed itself of all the\r\nold feelings of real love for Katusha, ruled supreme, leaving room for\r\nnothing else. He went about as if demented all the evening, now into his\r\naunts\', then back into his own room, then out into the porch, thinking\r\nall the time how he could meet her alone; but she avoided him, and\r\nMatrona Pavlovna watched her closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF AND KATUSHA.\r\n\r\nAnd so the evening passed and night came. The doctor went to bed.\r\nNekhludoff\'s aunts had also retired, and he knew that Matrona Pavlovna\r\nwas now with them in their bedroom so that Katusha was sure to be alone\r\nin the maids\' sitting-room. He again went out into the porch. It was\r\ndark, damp and warm out of doors, and that white spring mist which\r\ndrives away the last snow, or is diffused by the thawing of the last\r\nsnow, filled the air. From the river under the hill, about a hundred\r\nsteps from the front door, came a strange sound. It was the ice\r\nbreaking. Nekhludoff came down the steps and went up to the window of\r\nthe maids\' room, stepping over the puddles on the bits of glazed snow.\r\nHis heart was beating so fiercely in his breast that he seemed to hear\r\nit, his laboured breath came and went in a burst of long-drawn sighs. In\r\nthe maids\' room a small lamp was burning, and Katusha sat alone by the\r\ntable, looking thoughtfully in front of her. Nekhludoff stood a long\r\ntime without moving and waited to see what she, not knowing that she\r\nwas observed, would do. For a minute or two she did not move; then she\r\nlifted her eyes, smiled and shook her head as if chiding herself, then\r\nchanged her pose and dropped both her arms on the table and again began\r\ngazing down in front of her. He stood and looked at her, involuntarily\r\nlistening to the beating of his own heart and the strange sounds from\r\nthe river. There on the river, beneath the white mist, the unceasing\r\nlabour went on, and sounds as of something sobbing, cracking, dropping,\r\nbeing shattered to pieces mixed with the tinkling of the thin bits of\r\nice as they broke against each other like glass.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, looking at Katusha\'s serious, suffering face, which\r\nbetrayed the inner struggle of her soul, and he felt pity for her; but,\r\nstrange though it may seem, this pity only confirmed him in his evil\r\nintention.\r\n\r\nHe knocked at the window. She started as if she had received an electric\r\nshock, her whole body trembled, and a look of horror came into her face.\r\nThen she jumped up, approached the window and brought her face up to the\r\npane. The look of terror did not leave her face even when, holding her\r\nhands up to her eyes like blinkers and peering through the glass, she\r\nrecognised him. Her face was unusually grave; he had never seen it so\r\nbefore. She returned his smile, but only in submission to him; there was\r\nno smile in her soul, only fear. He beckoned her with his hand to come\r\nout into the yard to him. But she shook her head and remained by the\r\nwindow. He brought his face close to the pane and was going to call out\r\nto her, but at that moment she turned to the door; evidently some one\r\ninside had called her. Nekhludoff moved away from the window. The fog\r\nwas so dense that five steps from the house the windows could not be\r\nseen, but the light from the lamp shone red and huge out of a shapeless\r\nblack mass. And on the river the same strange sounds went on, sobbing\r\nand rustling and cracking and tinkling. Somewhere in the fog, not\r\nfar off, a cock crowed; another answered, and then others, far in the\r\nvillage took up the cry till the sound of the crowing blended into one,\r\nwhile all around was silent excepting the river. It was the second time\r\nthe cocks crowed that night.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff walked up and down behind the corner of the house, and once\r\nor twice got into a puddle. Then again came up to the window. The lamp\r\nwas still burning, and she was again sitting alone by the table as\r\nif uncertain what to do. He had hardly approached the window when she\r\nlooked up. He knocked. Without looking who it was she at once ran out of\r\nthe room, and he heard the outside door open with a snap. He waited\r\nfor her near the side porch and put his arms round her without saying a\r\nword. She clung to him, put up her face, and met his kiss with her lips.\r\nThen the door again gave the same sort of snap and opened, and the voice\r\nof Matrona Pavlovna called out angrily, "Katusha!"\r\n\r\nShe tore herself away from him and returned into the maids\' room. He\r\nheard the latch click, and then all was quiet. The red light disappeared\r\nand only the mist remained, and the bustle on the river went on.\r\nNekhludoff went up to the window, nobody was to be seen; he knocked, but\r\ngot no answer. He went back into the house by the front door, but could\r\nnot sleep. He got up and went with bare feet along the passage to her\r\ndoor, next to Matrona Pavlovna\'s room. He heard Matrona Pavlovna snoring\r\nquietly, and was about to go on when she coughed and turned on her\r\ncreaking bed, and his heart fell, and he stood immovable for about five\r\nminutes. When all was quiet and she began to snore peacefully again, he\r\nwent on, trying to step on the boards that did not creak, and came to\r\nKatusha\'s door. There was no sound to be heard. She was probably\r\nawake, or else he would have heard her breathing. But as soon as he\r\nhad whispered "Katusha" she jumped up and began to persuade him, as if\r\nangrily, to go away.\r\n\r\n"Open! Let me in just for a moment! I implore you!" He hardly knew what\r\nhe was saying.\r\n\r\n                   * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen she left him, trembling and silent, giving no answer to his words,\r\nhe again went out into the porch and stood trying to understand the\r\nmeaning of what had happened.\r\n\r\nIt was getting lighter. From the river below the creaking and tinkling\r\nand sobbing of the breaking ice came still louder and a gurgling sound\r\ncould now also be heard. The mist had begun to sink, and from above it\r\nthe waning moon dimly lighted up something black and weird.\r\n\r\n"What was the meaning of it all? Was it a great joy or a great\r\nmisfortune that had befallen him?" he asked himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAFTERWARDS.\r\n\r\nThe next day the gay, handsome, and brilliant Schonbock joined\r\nNekhludoff at his aunts\' house, and quite won their hearts by his\r\nrefined and amiable manner, his high spirits, his generosity, and his\r\naffection for Dmitri.\r\n\r\nBut though the old ladies admired his generosity it rather perplexed\r\nthem, for it seemed exaggerated. He gave a rouble to some blind beggars\r\nwho came to the gate, gave 15 roubles in tips to the servants, and\r\nwhen Sophia Ivanovna\'s pet dog hurt his paw and it bled, he tore his\r\nhemstitched cambric handkerchief into strips (Sophia Ivanovna knew that\r\nsuch handkerchiefs cost at least 15 roubles a dozen) and bandaged the\r\ndog\'s foot. The old ladies had never met people of this kind, and did\r\nnot know that Schonbock owed 200,000 roubles which he was never going to\r\npay, and that therefore 25 roubles more or less did not matter a bit to\r\nhim. Schonbock stayed only one day, and he and Nekhludoff both, left\r\nat night. They could not stay away from their regiment any longer, for\r\ntheir leave was fully up.\r\n\r\nAt the stage which Nekhludoff\'s selfish mania had now reached he could\r\nthink of nothing but himself. He was wondering whether his conduct, if\r\nfound out, would be blamed much or at all, but he did not consider what\r\nKatusha was now going through, and what was going to happen to her.\r\n\r\nHe saw that Schonbock guessed his relations to her and this flattered\r\nhis vanity.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see how it is you have taken such a sudden fancy to your aunts\r\nthat you have been living nearly a week with them," Schonbock remarked\r\nwhen he had seen Katusha. "Well, I don\'t wonder--should have done the\r\nsame. She\'s charming." Nekhludoff was also thinking that though it was\r\na pity to go away before having fully gratified the cravings of his\r\nlove for her, yet the absolute necessity of parting had its advantages\r\nbecause it put a sudden stop to relations it would have been very\r\ndifficult for him to continue. Then he thought that he ought to give her\r\nsome money, not for her, not because she might need it, but because it\r\nwas the thing to do.\r\n\r\nSo he gave her what seemed to him a liberal amount, considering his and\r\nher station. On the day of his departure, after dinner, he went out and\r\nwaited for her at the side entrance. She flushed up when she saw him\r\nand wished to pass by, directing his attention to the open door of the\r\nmaids\' room by a look, but he stopped her.\r\n\r\n"I have come to say good-bye," he said, crumbling in his hand an\r\nenvelope with a 100-rouble note inside. "There, I . . . "\r\n\r\nShe guessed what he meant, knit her brows, and shaking her head pushed\r\nhis hand away.\r\n\r\n"Take it; oh, you must!" he stammered, and thrust the envelope into the\r\nbib of her apron and ran back to his room, groaning and frowning as if\r\nhe had hurt himself. And for a long time he went up and down writhing as\r\nin pain, and even stamping and groaning aloud as he thought of this last\r\nscene. "But what else could I have done? Is it not what happens to every\r\none? And if every one does the same . . . well I suppose it can\'t be\r\nhelped." In this way he tried to get peace of mind, but in vain. The\r\nrecollection of what had passed burned his conscience. In his soul--in\r\nthe very depths of his soul--he knew that he had acted in a base, cruel,\r\ncowardly manner, and that the knowledge of this act of his must prevent\r\nhim, not only from finding fault with any one else, but even from\r\nlooking straight into other people\'s eyes; not to mention the\r\nimpossibility of considering himself a splendid, noble, high-minded\r\nfellow, as he did and had to do to go on living his life boldly and\r\nmerrily. There was only one solution of the problem--i.e., not to think\r\nabout it. He succeeded in doing so. The life he was now entering upon,\r\nthe new surroundings, new friends, the war, all helped him to forget.\r\nAnd the longer he lived, the less he thought about it, until at last he\r\nforgot it completely.\r\n\r\nOnce only, when, after the war, he went to see his aunts in hopes of\r\nmeeting Katusha, and heard that soon after his last visit she had left,\r\nand that his aunts had heard she had been confined somewhere or other\r\nand had gone quite to the bad, his heart ached. According to the time of\r\nher confinement, the child might or might not have been his. His aunts\r\nsaid she had gone wrong, that she had inherited her mother\'s depraved\r\nnature, and he was pleased to hear this opinion of his aunts\'. It seemed\r\nto acquit him. At first he thought of trying to find her and her child,\r\nbut then, just because in the depths of his soul he felt so ashamed and\r\npained when thinking about her, he did not make the necessary effort to\r\nfind her, but tried to forget his sin again and ceased to think about\r\nit. And now this strange coincidence brought it all back to his memory,\r\nand demanded from him the acknowledgment of the heartless, cruel\r\ncowardice which had made it possible for him to live these nine years\r\nwith such a sin on his conscience. But he was still far from such an\r\nacknowledgment, and his only fear was that everything might now be found\r\nout, and that she or her advocate might recount it all and put him to\r\nshame before every one present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--RESUMPTION.\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind Nekhludoff left the Court and went into the\r\njurymen\'s room. He sat by the window smoking all the while, and hearing\r\nwhat was being said around him.\r\n\r\nThe merry merchant seemed with all his heart to sympathise with\r\nSmelkoff\'s way of spending his time. "There, old fellow, that was\r\nsomething like! Real Siberian fashion! He knew what he was about, no\r\nfear! That\'s the sort of wench for me."\r\n\r\nThe foreman was stating his conviction, that in some way or other the\r\nexpert\'s conclusions were the important thing. Peter Gerasimovitch\r\nwas joking about something with the Jewish clerk, and they burst out\r\nlaughing. Nekhludoff answered all the questions addressed to him in\r\nmonosyllables and longed only to be left in peace.\r\n\r\nWhen the usher, with his sideways gait, called the jury back to the\r\nCourt, Nekhludoff was seized with fear, as if he were not going to\r\njudge, but to be judged. In the depth of his soul he felt that he was a\r\nscoundrel, who ought to be ashamed to look people in the face, yet,\r\nby sheer force of habit, he stepped on to the platform in his usual\r\nself-possessed manner, and sat down, crossing his legs and playing with\r\nhis pince-nez.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners had also been led out, and were now brought in again.\r\nThere were some new faces in the Court witnesses, and Nekhludoff noticed\r\nthat Maslova could not take her eyes off a very fat woman who sat in the\r\nrow in front of the grating, very showily dressed in silk and velvet, a\r\nhigh hat with a large bow on her head, and an elegant little reticule on\r\nher arm, which was bare to the elbow. This was, as he subsequently found\r\nout, one of the witnesses, the mistress of the establishment to which\r\nMaslova had belonged.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the witnesses commenced: they were asked their names,\r\nreligion, etc. Then, after some consultation as to whether the witnesses\r\nwere to be sworn in or not, the old priest came in again, dragging\r\nhis legs with difficulty, and, again arranging the golden cross on his\r\nbreast, swore the witnesses and the expert in the same quiet manner,\r\nand with the same assurance that he was doing something useful and\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses having been sworn, all but Kitaeva, the keeper of the\r\nhouse, were led out again. She was asked what she knew about this\r\naffair. Kitaeva nodded her head and the big hat at every sentence\r\nand smiled affectedly. She gave a very full and intelligent account,\r\nspeaking with a strong German accent. First of all, the hotel servant\r\nSimeon, whom she knew, came to her establishment on behalf of a rich\r\nSiberian merchant, and she sent Lubov back with him. After a time\r\nLubov returned with the merchant. The merchant was already somewhat\r\nintoxicated--she smiled as she said this--and went on drinking and\r\ntreating the girls. He was short of money. He sent this same Lubov to\r\nhis lodgings. He had taken a "predilection" to her. She looked at the\r\nprisoner as she said this.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thought he saw Maslova smile here, and this seemed disgusting\r\nto him. A strange, indefinite feeling of loathing, mingled with\r\nsuffering, arose in him.\r\n\r\n"And what was your opinion of Maslova?" asked the blushing and confused\r\napplicant for a judicial post, appointed to act as Maslova\'s advocate.\r\n\r\n"Zee ferry pesht," answered Kitaeva. "Zee yoong voman is etucated and\r\nelecant. She was prought up in a coot family and can reat French. She\r\ntid have a trop too moch sometimes, put nefer forcot herself. A ferry\r\ncoot girl."\r\n\r\nKatusha looked at the woman, then suddenly turned her eyes on the jury\r\nand fixed them on Nekhludoff, and her face grew serious and even severe.\r\nOne of her serious eyes squinted, and those two strange eyes for some\r\ntime gazed at Nekhludoff, who, in spite of the terrors that seized him,\r\ncould not take his look off these squinting eyes, with their bright,\r\nclear whites.\r\n\r\nHe thought of that dreadful night, with its mist, the ice breaking on\r\nthe river below, and when the waning moon, with horns turned upwards,\r\nthat had risen towards morning, lit up something black and weird. These\r\ntwo black eyes now looking at him reminded him of this weird, black\r\nsomething. "She has recognised me," he thought, and Nekhludoff shrank as\r\nif expecting a blow. But she had not recognised him. She sighed quietly\r\nand again looked at the president. Nekhludoff also sighed. "Oh, if it\r\nwould only get on quicker," he thought.\r\n\r\nHe now felt the same loathing and pity and vexation as when, out\r\nshooting, he was obliged to kill a wounded bird. The wounded bird\r\nstruggles in the game bag. One is disgusted and yet feels pity, and one\r\nis in a hurry to kill the bird and forget it.\r\n\r\nSuch mixed feelings filled Nekhludoff\'s breast as he sat listening to\r\nthe examination of the witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE MEDICAL REPORT.\r\n\r\nBut, as if to spite him, the case dragged out to a great length. After\r\neach witness had been examined separately and the expert last of all,\r\nand a great number of useless questions had been put, with the usual\r\nair of importance, by the public prosecutor and by both advocates, the\r\npresident invited the jury to examine the objects offered as material\r\nevidence. They consisted of an enormous diamond ring, which had\r\nevidently been worn on the first finger, and a test tube in which the\r\npoison had been analysed. These things had seals and labels attached to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJust as the witnesses were about to look at these things, the public\r\nprosecutor rose and demanded that before they did this the results of\r\nthe doctor\'s examination of the body should be read. The president, who\r\nwas hurrying the business through as fast as he could in order to visit\r\nhis Swiss friend, though he knew that the reading of this paper could\r\nhave no other effect than that of producing weariness and putting off\r\nthe dinner hour, and that the public prosecutor wanted it read simply\r\nbecause he knew he had a right to demand it, had no option but to\r\nexpress his consent.\r\n\r\nThe secretary got out the doctor\'s report and again began to read in his\r\nweary lisping voice, making no distinction between the "r\'s" and "l\'s."\r\n\r\nThe external examination proved that:\r\n\r\n"1. Theropont Smelkoff\'s height was six feet five inches.\r\n\r\n"Not so bad, that. A very good size," whispered the merchant, with\r\ninterest, into Nekhludoff\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"2. He looked about 40 years of age.\r\n\r\n"3. The body was of a swollen appearance.\r\n\r\n"4. The flesh was of a greenish colour, with dark spots in several\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n"5. The skin was raised in blisters of different sizes and in places had\r\ncome off in large pieces.\r\n\r\n"6. The hair was chestnut; it was thick, and separated easily from the\r\nskin when touched.\r\n\r\n"7. The eye-balls protruded from their sockets and the cornea had grown\r\ndim.\r\n\r\n"8. Out of the nostrils, both ears, and the mouth oozed serous liquid;\r\nthe mouth was half open.\r\n\r\n"9. The neck had almost disappeared, owing to the swelling of the face\r\nand chest."\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so on.\r\n\r\nFour pages were covered with the 27 paragraphs describing all the\r\ndetails of the external examination of the enormous, fat, swollen, and\r\ndecomposing body of the merchant who had been making merry in the\r\ntown. The indefinite loathing that Nekhludoff felt was increased by the\r\ndescription of the corpse. Katusha\'s life, and the scrum oozing from\r\nthe nostrils of the corpse, and the eyes that protruded out of their\r\nsockets, and his own treatment of her--all seemed to belong to the same\r\norder of things, and he felt surrounded and wholly absorbed by things of\r\nthe same nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the reading of the report of the external examination was ended,\r\nthe president heaved a sigh and raised his hand, hoping it was finished;\r\nbut the secretary at once went on to the description of the internal\r\nexamination. The president\'s head again dropped into his hand and he\r\nshut his eyes. The merchant next to Nekhludoff could hardly keep awake,\r\nand now and then his body swayed to and fro. The prisoners and the\r\ngendarmes sat perfectly quiet.\r\n\r\nThe internal examination showed that:\r\n\r\n"1. The skin was easily detachable from the bones of the skull, and\r\nthere was no coagulated blood.\r\n\r\n"2. The bones of the skull were of average thickness and in sound\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n"3. On the membrane of the brain there were two discoloured spots about\r\nfour inches long, the membrane itself being of a dull white." And so on\r\nfor 13 paragraphs more. Then followed the names and signatures of\r\nthe assistants, and the doctor\'s conclusion showing that the changes\r\nobserved in the stomach, and to a lesser degree in the bowels and\r\nkidneys, at the postmortem examination, and described in the official\r\nreport, gave great probability to the conclusion that Smelkoff\'s death\r\nwas caused by poison which had entered his stomach mixed with alcohol.\r\nTo decide from the state of the stomach what poison had been introduced\r\nwas difficult; but it was necessary to suppose that the poison entered\r\nthe stomach mixed with alcohol, since a great quantity of the latter was\r\nfound in Smelkoff\'s stomach.\r\n\r\n"He could drink, and no mistake," again whispered the merchant, who had\r\njust waked up.\r\n\r\nThe reading of this report had taken a full hour, but it had not\r\nsatisfied the public prosecutor, for, when it had been read through and\r\nthe president turned to him, saying, "I suppose it is superfluous to\r\nread the report of the examination of the internal organs?" he answered\r\nin a severe tone, without looking at the president, "I shall ask to have\r\nit read."\r\n\r\nHe raised himself a little, and showed by his manner that he had a right\r\nto have this report read, and would claim this right, and that if that\r\nwere not granted it would serve as a cause of appeal.\r\n\r\nThe member of the Court with the big beard, who suffered from catarrh of\r\nthe stomach, feeling quite done up, turned to the president:\r\n\r\n"What is the use of reading all this? It is only dragging it out. These\r\nnew brooms do not sweep clean; they only take a long while doing it."\r\n\r\nThe member with the gold spectacles said nothing, but only looked\r\ngloomily in front of him, expecting nothing good, either from his wife\r\nor life in general. The reading of the report commenced.\r\n\r\n"In the year 188-, on February 15th, I, the undersigned, commissioned\r\nby the medical department, made an examination, No. 638," the secretary\r\nbegan again with firmness and raising the pitch of his voice as if to\r\ndispel the sleepiness that had overtaken all present, "in the presence\r\nof the assistant medical inspector, of the internal organs:\r\n\r\n"1. The right lung and the heart (contained in a 6-lb. glass jar).\r\n\r\n"2. The contents of the stomach (in a 6-lb. glass jar).\r\n\r\n"3. The stomach itself (in a 6-lb. glass jar).\r\n\r\n"4. The liver, the spleen and the kidneys (in a 9-lb. glass jar).\r\n\r\n"5. The intestines (in a 9-lb. earthenware jar)."\r\n\r\nThe president here whispered to one of the members, then stooped to the\r\nother, and having received their consent, he said: "The Court considers\r\nthe reading of this report superfluous." The secretary stopped reading\r\nand folded the paper, and the public prosecutor angrily began to write\r\ndown something. "The gentlemen of the jury may now examine the articles\r\nof material evidence," said the president. The foreman and several of\r\nthe others rose and went to the table, not quite knowing what to do with\r\ntheir hands. They looked in turn at the glass, the test tube, and the\r\nring. The merchant even tried on the ring.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that was a finger," he said, returning to his place; "like a\r\ncucumber," he added. Evidently the image he had formed in his mind of\r\nthe gigantic merchant amused him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE PROSECUTOR AND THE ADVOCATES.\r\n\r\nWhen the examination of the articles of material evidence was finished,\r\nthe president announced that the investigation was now concluded and\r\nimmediately called on the prosecutor to proceed, hoping that as the\r\nlatter was also a man, he, too, might feel inclined to smoke or dine,\r\nand show some mercy on the rest. But the public prosecutor showed mercy\r\nneither to himself nor to any one else. He was very stupid by nature,\r\nbut, besides this, he had had the misfortune of finishing school with a\r\ngold medal and of receiving a reward for his essay on "Servitude" when\r\nstudying Roman Law at the University, and was therefore self-confident\r\nand self-satisfied in the highest degree (his success with the ladies\r\nalso conducing to this) and his stupidity had become extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWhen the word was given to him, he got up slowly, showing the whole of\r\nhis graceful figure in his embroidered uniform. Putting his hand on the\r\ndesk he looked round the room, slightly bowing his head, and, avoiding\r\nthe eyes of the prisoners, began to read the speech he had prepared\r\nwhile the reports were being read.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen of the jury! The business that now lies before you is, if I\r\nmay so express myself, very characteristic."\r\n\r\nThe speech of a public prosecutor, according to his views, should always\r\nhave a social importance, like the celebrated speeches made by the\r\nadvocates who have become distinguished. True, the audience consisted of\r\nthree women--a semptress, a cook, and Simeon\'s sister--and a coachman;\r\nbut this did not matter. The celebrities had begun in the same way. To\r\nbe always at the height of his position, i.e., to penetrate into the\r\ndepths of the psychological significance of crime and to discover the\r\nwounds of society, was one of the prosecutor\'s principles.\r\n\r\n"You see before you, gentlemen of the jury, a crime characteristic, if\r\nI may so express myself, of the end of our century; bearing, so to say,\r\nthe specific features of that very painful phenomenon, the corruption to\r\nwhich those elements of our present-day society, which are, so to say,\r\nparticularly exposed to the burning rays of this process, are subject."\r\n\r\nThe public prosecutor spoke at great length, trying not to forget any of\r\nthe notions he had formed in his mind, and, on the other hand, never to\r\nhesitate, and let his speech flow on for an hour and a quarter without a\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nOnly once he stopped and for some time stood swallowing his saliva, but\r\nhe soon mastered himself and made up for the interruption by heightened\r\neloquence. He spoke, now with a tender, insinuating accent, stepping\r\nfrom foot to foot and looking at the jury, now in quiet, business-like\r\ntones, glancing into his notebook, then with a loud, accusing voice,\r\nlooking from the audience to the advocates. But he avoided looking at\r\nthe prisoners, who were all three fixedly gazing at him. Every new craze\r\nthen in vogue among his set was alluded to in his speech; everything\r\nthat then was, and some things that still are, considered to be the last\r\nwords of scientific wisdom: the laws of heredity and inborn criminality,\r\nevolution and the struggle for existence, hypnotism and hypnotic\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nAccording to his definition, the merchant Smelkoff was of the genuine\r\nRussian type, and had perished in consequence of his generous, trusting\r\nnature, having fallen into the hands of deeply degraded individuals.\r\n\r\nSimeon Kartinkin was the atavistic production of serfdom, a stupefied,\r\nignorant, unprincipled man, who had not even any religion. Euphemia was\r\nhis mistress, and a victim of heredity; all the signs of degeneration\r\nwere noticeable in her. The chief wire-puller in this affair was\r\nMaslova, presenting the phenomenon of decadence in its lowest form.\r\n"This woman," he said, looking at her, "has, as we have to-day heard\r\nfrom her mistress in this court, received an education; she cannot only\r\nread and write, but she knows French; she is illegitimate, and probably\r\ncarries in her the germs of criminality. She was educated in an\r\nenlightened, noble family and might have lived by honest work, but she\r\ndeserts her benefactress, gives herself up to a life of shame in which\r\nshe is distinguished from her companions by her education, and chiefly,\r\ngentlemen of the jury, as you have heard from her mistress, by her power\r\nof acting on the visitors by means of that mysterious capacity lately\r\ninvestigated by science, especially by the school of Charcot, known by\r\nthe name of hypnotic influence. By these means she gets hold of this\r\nRussian, this kind-hearted Sadko, [Sadko, the hero of a legend] the rich\r\nguest, and uses his trust in order first to rob and then pitilessly to\r\nmurder him."\r\n\r\n"Well, he is piling it on now, isn\'t he?" said the president with a\r\nsmile, bending towards the serious member.\r\n\r\n"A fearful blockhead!" said the serious member.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the public prosecutor went on with his speech. "Gentlemen of\r\nthe jury," gracefully swaying his body, "the fate of society is to a\r\ncertain extent in your power. Your verdict will influence it. Grasp the\r\nfull meaning of this crime, the danger that awaits society from those\r\nwhom I may perhaps be permitted to call pathological individuals, such\r\nas Maslova. Guard it from infection; guard the innocent and strong\r\nelements of society from contagion or even destruction."\r\n\r\nAnd as if himself overcome by the significance of the expected verdict,\r\nthe public prosecutor sank into his chair, highly delighted with his\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe sense of the speech, when divested of all its flowers of rhetoric,\r\nwas that Maslova, having gained the merchant\'s confidence, hypnotised\r\nhim and went to his lodgings with his key meaning to take all the money\r\nherself, but having been caught in the act by Simeon and Euphemia had to\r\nshare it with them. Then, in order to hide the traces of the crime, she\r\nhad returned to the lodgings with the merchant and there poisoned him.\r\n\r\nAfter the prosecutor had spoken, a middle-aged man in swallow-tail coat\r\nand low-cut waistcoat showing a large half-circle of starched white\r\nshirt, rose from the advocates\' bench and made a speech in defence of\r\nKartinkin and Botchkova; this was an advocate engaged by them for 300\r\nroubles. He acquitted them both and put all the blame on Maslova. He\r\ndenied the truth of Maslova\'s statements that Botchkova and Kartinkin\r\nwere with her when she took the money, laying great stress on the\r\npoint that her evidence could not be accepted, she being charged with\r\npoisoning. "The 2,500 roubles," the advocate said, "could have been\r\neasily earned by two honest people getting from three to five roubles\r\nper day in tips from the lodgers. The merchant\'s money was stolen by\r\nMaslova and given away, or even lost, as she was not in a normal state."\r\n\r\nThe poisoning was committed by Maslova alone; therefore he begged the\r\njury to acquit Kartinkin and Botchkova of stealing the money; or if they\r\ncould not acquit them of the theft, at least to admit that it was done\r\nwithout any participation in the poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the advocate remarked, with a thrust at the public\r\nprosecutor, that "the brilliant observations of that gentleman on\r\nheredity, while explaining scientific facts concerning heredity, were\r\ninapplicable in this case, as Botchkova was of unknown parentage." The\r\npublic prosecutor put something down on paper with an angry look, and\r\nshrugged his shoulders in contemptuous surprise.\r\n\r\nThen Maslova\'s advocate rose, and timidly and hesitatingly began his\r\nspeech in her defence.\r\n\r\nWithout denying that she had taken part in the stealing of the money,\r\nhe insisted on the fact that she had no intention of poisoning Smelkoff,\r\nbut had given him the powder only to make him fall asleep. He tried to\r\ngo in for a little eloquence in giving a description of how Maslova was\r\nled into a life of debauchery by a man who had remained unpunished while\r\nshe had to bear all the weight of her fall; but this excursion into the\r\ndomain of psychology was so unsuccessful that it made everybody feel\r\nuncomfortable. When he muttered something about men\'s cruelty and\r\nwomen\'s helplessness, the president tried to help him by asking him to\r\nkeep closer to the facts of the case. When he had finished the public\r\nprosecutor got up to reply. He defended his position against the first\r\nadvocate, saying that even if Botchkova was of unknown parentage the\r\ntruth of the doctrine of heredity was thereby in no way invalidated,\r\nsince the laws of heredity were so far proved by science that we can not\r\nonly deduce the crime from heredity, but heredity from the crime. As to\r\nthe statement made in defence of Maslova, that she was the victim of an\r\nimaginary (he laid a particularly venomous stress on the word imaginary)\r\nbetrayer, he could only say that from the evidence before them it was\r\nmuch more likely that she had played the part of temptress to many and\r\nmany a victim who had fallen into her hands. Having said this he sat\r\ndown in triumph. Then the prisoners were offered permission to speak in\r\ntheir own defence.\r\n\r\nEuphemia Botchkova repeated once more that she knew nothing about it and\r\nhad taken part in nothing, and firmly laid the whole blame on Maslova.\r\nSimeon Kartinkin only repeated several times: "It is your business, but\r\nI am innocent; it\'s unjust." Maslova said nothing in her defence. Told\r\nshe might do so by the president, she only lifted her eyes to him, cast\r\na look round the room like a hunted animal, and, dropping her head,\r\nbegan to cry, sobbing aloud.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" the merchant asked Nekhludoff, hearing him utter\r\na strange sound. This was the sound of weeping fiercely kept back.\r\nNekhludoff had not yet understood the significance of his present\r\nposition, and attributed the sobs he could hardly keep back and the\r\ntears that filled his eyes to the weakness of his nerves. He put on his\r\npince-nez in order to hide the tears, then got out his handkerchief and\r\nbegan blowing his nose.\r\n\r\nFear of the disgrace that would befall him if every one in the court\r\nknew of his conduct stifled the inner working of his soul. This fear\r\nwas, during this first period, stronger than all else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE SUMMING UP.\r\n\r\nAfter the last words of the prisoners had been heard, the form in which\r\nthe questions were to be put to the jury was settled, which also took\r\nsome time. At last the questions were formulated, and the president\r\nbegan the summing up.\r\n\r\nBefore putting the case to the jury, he spoke to them for some time in a\r\npleasant, homely manner, explaining that burglary was burglary and theft\r\nwas theft, and that stealing from a place which was under lock and key\r\nwas stealing from a place under lock and key. While he was explaining\r\nthis, he looked several times at Nekhludoff as if wishing to impress\r\nupon him these important facts, in hopes that, having understood it,\r\nNekhludoff would make his fellow-jurymen also understand it. When he\r\nconsidered that the jury were sufficiently imbued with these facts, he\r\nproceeded to enunciate another truth--namely, that a murder is an\r\naction which has the death of a human being as its consequence, and that\r\npoisoning could therefore also be termed murder. When, according to his\r\nopinion, this truth had also been received by the jury, he went on to\r\nexplain that if theft and murder had been committed at the same time,\r\nthe combination of the crimes was theft with murder.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was himself anxious to finish as soon as possible, although\r\nhe knew that his Swiss friend would be waiting for him, he had grown so\r\nused to his occupation that, having begun to speak, he could not stop\r\nhimself, and therefore he went on to impress on the jury with much\r\ndetail that if they found the prisoners guilty, they would have the\r\nright to give a verdict of guilty; and if they found them not guilty,\r\nto give a verdict of not guilty; and if they found them guilty of one of\r\nthe crimes and not of the other, they might give a verdict of guilty\r\non the one count and of not guilty on the other. Then he explained that\r\nthough this right was given them they should use it with reason.\r\n\r\nHe was going to add that if they gave an affirmative answer to any\r\nquestion that was put to them they would thereby affirm everything\r\nincluded in the question, so that if they did not wish to affirm the\r\nwhole of the question they should mention the part of the question they\r\nwished to be excepted. But, glancing at the clock, and seeing it was\r\nalready five minutes to three, he resolved to trust to their being\r\nintelligent enough to understand this without further comment.\r\n\r\n"The facts of this case are the following," began the president, and\r\nrepeated all that had already been said several times by the advocates,\r\nthe public prosecutor and the witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe president spoke, and the members on each side of him listened with\r\ndeeply-attentive expressions, but looked from time to time at the clock,\r\nfor they considered the speech too long though very good--i.e., such\r\nas it ought to be. The public prosecutor, the lawyers, and, in fact,\r\neveryone in the court, shared the same impression. The president\r\nfinished the summing up. Then he found it necessary to tell the jury\r\nwhat they all knew, or might have found out by reading it up--i.e., how\r\nthey were to consider the case, count the votes, in case of a tie to\r\nacquit the prisoners, and so on.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to have been told; but no, the president could not\r\nforego his right of speaking as yet. It was so pleasant to hear the\r\nimpressive tones of his own voice, and therefore he found it necessary\r\nto say a few words more about the importance of the rights given to the\r\njury, how carefully they should use the rights and how they ought not\r\nto abuse them, about their being on their oath, that they were the\r\nconscience of society, that the secrecy of the debating-room should be\r\nconsidered sacred, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the president commenced his speech, Maslova watched him\r\nwithout moving her eyes as if afraid of losing a single word; so that\r\nNekhludoff was not afraid of meeting her eyes and kept looking at her\r\nall the time. And his mind passed through those phases in which a face\r\nwhich we have not seen for many years first strikes us with the outward\r\nchanges brought about during the time of separation, and then gradually\r\nbecomes more and more like its old self, when the changes made by\r\ntime seem to disappear, and before our spiritual eyes rises only the\r\nprincipal expression of one exceptional, unique individuality. Yes,\r\nthough dressed in a prison cloak, and in spite of the developed figure,\r\nthe fulness of the bosom and lower part of the face, in spite of a few\r\nwrinkles on the forehead and temples and the swollen eyes, this was\r\ncertainly the same Katusha who, on that Easter eve, had so innocently\r\nlooked up to him whom she loved, with her fond, laughing eyes full of\r\njoy and life.\r\n\r\n"What a strange coincidence that after ten years, during which I never\r\nsaw her, this case should have come up today when I am on the jury, and\r\nthat it is in the prisoners\' dock that I see her again! And how will it\r\nend? Oh, dear, if they would only get on quicker."\r\n\r\nStill he would not give in to the feelings of repentance which began to\r\narise within him. He tried to consider it all as a coincidence, which\r\nwould pass without infringing his manner of life. He felt himself in\r\nthe position of a puppy, when its master, taking it by the scruff of\r\nits neck, rubs its nose in the mess it has made. The puppy whines, draws\r\nback and wants to get away as far as possible from the effects of its\r\nmisdeed, but the pitiless master does not let go.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Nekhludoff, feeling all the repulsiveness of what he had done,\r\nfelt also the powerful hand of the Master, but he did not feel the whole\r\nsignificance of his action yet and would not recognise the Master\'s\r\nhand. He did not wish to believe that it was the effect of his deed that\r\nlay before him, but the pitiless hand of the Master held him and he felt\r\nhe could not get away. He was still keeping up his courage and sat on\r\nhis chair in the first row in his usual self-possessed pose, one leg\r\ncarelessly thrown over the other, and playing with his pince-nez. Yet\r\nall the while, in the depths of his soul, he felt the cruelty, cowardice\r\nand baseness, not only of this particular action of his but of his whole\r\nself-willed, depraved, cruel, idle life; and that dreadful veil which\r\nhad in some unaccountable manner hidden from him this sin of his and\r\nthe whole of his subsequent life was beginning to shake, and he caught\r\nglimpses of what was covered by that veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE VERDICT.\r\n\r\nAt last the president finished his speech, and lifting the list of\r\nquestions with a graceful movement of his arm he handed it to the\r\nforeman, who came up to take it. The jury, glad to be able to get\r\ninto the debating-court, got up one after the other and left the room,\r\nlooking as if a bit ashamed of themselves and again not knowing what\r\nto do with their hands. As soon as the door was closed behind them\r\na gendarme came up to it, pulled his sword out of the scabbard, and,\r\nholding it up against his shoulder, stood at the door. The judges got up\r\nand went away. The prisoners were also led out. When the jury came\r\ninto the debating-room the first thing they did was to take out their\r\ncigarettes, as before, and begin smoking. The sense of the unnaturalness\r\nand falseness of their position, which all of them had experienced\r\nwhile sitting in their places in the court, passed when they entered the\r\ndebating-room and started smoking, and they settled down with a feeling\r\nof relief and at once began an animated conversation.\r\n\r\n"\'Tisn\'t the girl\'s fault. She\'s got mixed up in it," said the kindly\r\nmerchant. "We must recommend her to mercy."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what we are going to consider," said the foreman. "We must\r\nnot give way to our personal impressions."\r\n\r\n"The president\'s summing up was good," remarked the colonel.\r\n\r\n"Good? Why, it nearly sent me to sleep!"\r\n\r\n"The chief point is that the servants could have known nothing about the\r\nmoney if Maslova had not been in accord with them," said the clerk of\r\nJewish extraction.\r\n\r\n"Well, do you think that it was she who stole the money?" asked one of\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\n"I will never believe it," cried the kindly merchant; "it was all that\r\nred-eyed hag\'s doing."\r\n\r\n"They are a nice lot, all of them," said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"But she says she never went into the room."\r\n\r\n"Oh, believe her by all means."\r\n\r\n"I should not believe that jade, not for the world."\r\n\r\n"Whether you believe her or not does not settle the question," said the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n"The girl had the key," said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"What if she had?" retorted the merchant.\r\n\r\n"And the ring?"\r\n\r\n"But didn\'t she say all about it?" again cried the merchant. "The fellow\r\nhad a temper of his own, and had had a drop too much besides, and gave\r\nthe girl a licking; what could be simpler? Well, then he\'s sorry--quite\r\nnaturally. \'There, never mind,\' says he; \'take this.\' Why, I heard them\r\nsay he was six foot five high; I should think he must have weighed about\r\n20 stones."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the point," said Peter Gerasimovitch. "The question is,\r\nwhether she was the instigator and inciter in this affair, or the\r\nservants?"\r\n\r\n"It was not possible for the servants to do it alone; she had the key."\r\n\r\nThis kind of random talk went on for a considerable time. At last the\r\nforeman said: "I beg your pardon, gentlemen, but had we not better take\r\nour places at the table and discuss the matter? Come, please." And he\r\ntook the chair.\r\n\r\nThe questions were expressed in the following manner.\r\n\r\n1. Is the peasant of the village Borki, Krapivinskia district, Simeon\r\nPetrov Kartinkin, 33 years of age, guilty of having, in agreement with\r\nother persons, given the merchant Smelkoff, on the 17th January, 188-,\r\nin the town of N-----, with intent to deprive him of life, for the\r\npurpose of robbing him, poisoned brandy, which caused Smelkoff\'s death,\r\nand of having stolen from him about 2,500 roubles in money and a diamond\r\nring?\r\n\r\n2. Is the meschanka Euphemia Ivanovna Botchkova, 43 years of age, guilty\r\nof the crimes described above?\r\n\r\n3. Is the meschanka Katerina Michaelovna Maslova, 27 years of age,\r\nguilty of the crimes described in the first question?\r\n\r\n4. If the prisoner Euphemia Botchkova is not guilty according to the\r\nfirst question, is she not guilty of having, on the 17th January, in the\r\ntown of N----, while in service at the hotel Mauritania, stolen from a\r\nlocked portmanteau, belonging to the merchant Smelkoff, a lodger in that\r\nhotel, and which was in the room occupied by him, 2,500 roubles, for\r\nwhich object she unlocked the portmanteau with a key she brought and\r\nfitted to the lock?\r\n\r\nThe foreman read the first question.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, what do you think?" This question was quickly\r\nanswered. All agreed to say "Guilty," as if convinced that Kartinkin\r\nhad taken part both in the poisoning and the robbery. An old artelshik,\r\n[member of an artel, an association of workmen, in which the members\r\nshare profits and liabilities] whose answers were all in favour of\r\nacquittal, was the only exception.\r\n\r\nThe foreman thought he did not understand, and began to point out to him\r\nthat everything tended to prove Kartinkin\'s guilt. The old man answered\r\nthat he did understand, but still thought it better to have pity on him.\r\n"We are not saints ourselves," and he kept to his opinion.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the second question concerning Botchkova was, after much\r\ndispute and many exclamations, answered by the words, "Not guilty,"\r\nthere being no clear proofs of her having taken part in the poisoning--a\r\nfact her advocate had strongly insisted on. The merchant, anxious to\r\nacquit Maslova, insisted that Botchkova was the chief instigator of it\r\nall. Many of the jury shared this view, but the foreman, wishing to be\r\nin strict accord with the law, declared they had no grounds to consider\r\nher as an accomplice in the poisoning. After much disputing the\r\nforeman\'s opinion triumphed.\r\n\r\nTo the fourth question concerning Botchkova the answer was "Guilty." But\r\non the artelshik\'s insistence she was recommended to mercy.\r\n\r\nThe third question, concerning Maslova, raised a fierce dispute. The\r\nforeman maintained she was guilty both of the poisoning and the theft,\r\nto which the merchant would not agree. The colonel, the clerk and the\r\nold artelshik sided with the merchant, the rest seemed shaky, and the\r\nopinion of the foreman began to gain ground, chiefly because all the\r\njurymen were getting tired, and preferred to take up the view that would\r\nbring them sooner to a decision and thus liberate them.\r\n\r\nFrom all that had passed, and from his former knowledge of Maslova,\r\nNekhludoff was certain that she was innocent of both the theft and the\r\npoisoning. And he felt sure that all the others would come to the same\r\nconclusion. When he saw that the merchant\'s awkward defence (evidently\r\nbased on his physical admiration for her, which he did not even try\r\nto hide) and the foreman\'s insistence, and especially everybody\'s\r\nweariness, were all tending to her condemnation, he longed to state his\r\nobjections, yet dared not, lest his relations with Maslova should be\r\ndiscovered. He felt he could not allow things to go on without stating\r\nhis objection; and, blushing and growing pale again, was about to speak\r\nwhen Peter Gerasimovitch, irritated by the authoritative manner of\r\nthe foreman, began to raise his objections and said the very things\r\nNekhludoff was about to say.\r\n\r\n"Allow me one moment," he said. "You seem to think that her having the\r\nkey proves she is guilty of the theft; but what could be easier than\r\nfor the servants to open the portmanteau with a false key after she was\r\ngone?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," said the merchant.\r\n\r\n"She could not have taken the money, because in her position she would\r\nhardly know what to do with it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I say," remarked the merchant.\r\n\r\n"But it is very likely that her coming put the idea into the servants\'\r\nheads and that they grasped the opportunity and shoved all the blame\r\non her." Peter Gerasimovitch spoke so irritably that the foreman became\r\nirritated too, and went on obstinately defending the opposite views; but\r\nPeter Gerasimovitch spoke so convincingly that the majority agreed with\r\nhim, and decided that Maslova was not guilty of stealing the money and\r\nthat the ring was given her.\r\n\r\nBut when the question of her having taken part in the poisoning was\r\nraised, her zealous defender, the merchant, declared that she must\r\nbe acquitted, because she could have no reason for the poisoning. The\r\nforeman, however, said that it was impossible to acquit her, because she\r\nherself had pleaded guilty to having given the powder.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but thinking it was opium," said the merchant.\r\n\r\n"Opium can also deprive one of life," said the colonel, who was fond\r\nof wandering from the subject, and he began telling how his\r\nbrother-in-law\'s wife would have died of an overdose of opium if there\r\nhad not been a doctor near at hand to take the necessary measures. The\r\ncolonel told his story so impressively, with such self-possession and\r\ndignity, that no one had the courage to interrupt him. Only the clerk,\r\ninfected by his example, decided to break in with a story of his own:\r\n"There are some who get so used to it that they can take 40 drops. I\r\nhave a relative--," but the colonel would not stand the interruption,\r\nand went on to relate what effects the opium had on his brother-in-law\'s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"But, gentlemen, do you know it is getting on towards five o\'clock?"\r\nsaid one of the jury.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, what are we to say, then?" inquired the foreman.\r\n"Shall we say she is guilty, but without intent to rob? And without\r\nstealing any property? Will that do?" Peter Gerasimovitch, pleased with\r\nhis victory, agreed.\r\n\r\n"But she must be recommended to mercy," said the merchant.\r\n\r\nAll agreed; only the old artelshik insisted that they should say "Not\r\nguilty."\r\n\r\n"It comes to the same thing," explained the foreman; "without intent to\r\nrob, and without stealing any property. Therefore, \'Not guilty,\' that\'s\r\nevident."\r\n\r\n"All right; that\'ll do. And we recommend her to mercy," said the\r\nmerchant, gaily.\r\n\r\nThey were all so tired, so confused by the discussions, that nobody\r\nthought of saying that she was guilty of giving the powder but without\r\nthe intent of taking life. Nekhludoff was so excited that he did not\r\nnotice this omission, and so the answers were written down in the form\r\nagreed upon and taken to the court.\r\n\r\nRabelais says that a lawyer who was trying a case quoted all sorts of\r\nlaws, read 20 pages of judicial senseless Latin, and then proposed to\r\nthe judges to throw dice, and if the numbers proved odd the defendant\r\nwould be right, if not, the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nIt was much the same in this case. The resolution was taken, not because\r\neverybody agreed upon it, but because the president, who had been\r\nsumming up at such length, omitted to say what he always said on such\r\noccasions, that the answer might be, "Yes, guilty, but without the\r\nintent of taking life;" because the colonel had related the story of his\r\nbrother-in-law\'s wife at such great length; because Nekhludoff was too\r\nexcited to notice that the proviso "without intent to take life" had\r\nbeen omitted, and thought that the words "without intent" nullified the\r\nconviction; because Peter Gerasimovitch had retired from the room while\r\nthe questions and answers were being read, and chiefly because, being\r\ntired, and wishing to get away as soon as possible, all were ready to\r\nagree with the decision which would bring matters to an end soonest.\r\n\r\nThe jurymen rang the bell. The gendarme who had stood outside the door\r\nwith his sword drawn put the sword back into the scabbard and stepped\r\naside. The judges took their seats and the jury came out one by one.\r\n\r\nThe foreman brought in the paper with an air of solemnity and handed\r\nit to the president, who looked at it, and, spreading out his hands\r\nin astonishment, turned to consult his companions. The president was\r\nsurprised that the jury, having put in a proviso--without intent to\r\nrob--did not put in a second proviso--without intent to take life. From\r\nthe decision of the jury it followed that Maslova had not stolen, nor\r\nrobbed, and yet poisoned a man without any apparent reason.\r\n\r\n"Just see what an absurd decision they have come to," he whispered to\r\nthe member on his left. "This means penal servitude in Siberia, and she\r\nis innocent."\r\n\r\n"Surely you do not mean to say she is innocent?" answered the serious\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is positively innocent. I think this is a case for putting\r\nArticle 817 into practice (Article 817 states that if the Court\r\nconsiders the decision of the jury unjust it may set it aside)."\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" said the president, turning to the other member.\r\nThe kindly member did not answer at once. He looked at the number on a\r\npaper before him and added up the figures; the sum would not divide\r\nby three. He had settled in his mind that if it did divide by three he\r\nwould agree to the president\'s proposal, but though the sum would not so\r\ndivide his kindness made him agree all the same.\r\n\r\n"I, too, think it should be done," he said.\r\n\r\n"And you?" asked the president, turning to the serious member.\r\n\r\n"On no account," he answered, firmly. "As it is, the papers accuse the\r\njury of acquitting prisoners. What will they say if the Court does it?\r\nI, shall not agree to that on any account."\r\n\r\nThe president looked at his watch. "It is a pity, but what\'s to be\r\ndone?" and handed the questions to the foreman to read out. All got\r\nup, and the foreman, stepping from foot to foot, coughed, and read the\r\nquestions and the answers. All the Court, secretary, advocates, and even\r\nthe public prosecutor, expressed surprise. The prisoners sat impassive,\r\nevidently not understanding the meaning of the answers. Everybody sat\r\ndown again, and the president asked the prosecutor what punishments the\r\nprisoners were to be subjected to.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor, glad of his unexpected success in getting Maslova\r\nconvicted, and attributing the success entirely to his own eloquence,\r\nlooked up the necessary information, rose and said: "With Simeon\r\nKartinkin I should deal according to Statute 1,452 paragraph 93.\r\nEuphemia Botchkova according to Statute . . ., etc. Katerina Maslova\r\naccording to Statute . . ., etc."\r\n\r\nAll three punishments were the heaviest that could be inflicted.\r\n\r\n"The Court will adjourn to consider the sentence," said the president,\r\nrising. Everybody rose after him, and with the pleasant feeling of a\r\ntask well done began to leave the room or move about in it.\r\n\r\n"D\'you know, sirs, we have made a shameful hash of it?" said Peter\r\nGerasimovitch, approaching Nekhludoff, to whom the foreman was relating\r\nsomething. "Why, we\'ve got her to Siberia."\r\n\r\n"What are you saying?" exclaimed Nekhludoff. This time he did not notice\r\nthe teacher\'s familiarity.\r\n\r\n"Why, we did not put in our answer \'Guilty, but without intent of\r\ncausing death.\' The secretary just told me the public prosecutor is for\r\ncondemning her to 15 years\' penal servitude."\r\n\r\n"Well, but it was decided so," said the foreman.\r\n\r\nPeter Gerasimovitch began to dispute this, saying that since she did\r\nnot take the money it followed naturally that she could not have had any\r\nintention of committing murder.\r\n\r\n"But I read the answer before going out," said the foreman, defending\r\nhimself, "and nobody objected."\r\n\r\n"I had just then gone out of the room," said Peter Gerasimovitch,\r\nturning to Nekhludoff, "and your thoughts must have been wool-gathering\r\nto let the thing pass."\r\n\r\n"I never imagined this," Nekhludoff replied.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, we can get it put right," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear no; it\'s finished."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked at the prisoners. They whose fate was being decided\r\nstill sat motionless behind the grating in front of the soldiers.\r\nMaslova was smiling. Another feeling stirred in Nekhludoff\'s soul. Up to\r\nnow, expecting her acquittal and thinking she would remain in the town,\r\nhe was uncertain how to act towards her. Any kind of relations with her\r\nwould be so very difficult. But Siberia and penal servitude at once cut\r\noff every possibility of any kind of relations with her. The wounded\r\nbird would stop struggling in the game-bag, and no longer remind him of\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL--THE SENTENCE.\r\n\r\nPeter Gerasimovitch\'s assumption was correct. The president came back\r\nfrom the debating room with a paper, and read as follows:--"April 28th,\r\n188-. By His Imperial Majesty\'s ukase No. ----- The Criminal Court, on\r\nthe strength of the decision of the jury, in accordance with Section\r\n3 of Statute 771, Section 3 of Statutes 770 and 777, decrees that the\r\npeasant, Simeon Kartinkin, 33 years of age, and the meschanka Katerina\r\nMaslova, 27 years of age, are to be deprived of all property rights and\r\nto be sent to penal servitude in Siberia, Kartinkin for eight, Maslova\r\nfor four years, with the consequences stated in Statute 25 of the code.\r\nThe meschanka Botchkova, 43 years of age, to be deprived of all special\r\npersonal and acquired rights, and to be imprisoned for three years with\r\nconsequences in accord with Statute 48 of the code. The costs of the\r\ncase to be borne equally by the prisoners; and, in the case of their\r\nbeing without sufficient property, the costs to be transferred to the\r\nTreasury. Articles of material evidence to be sold, the ring to be\r\nreturned, the phials destroyed." Botchkova was condemned to prison,\r\nSimeon Kartinken and Katerina Maslova to the loss of all special rights\r\nand privileges and to penal servitude in Siberia, he for eight and she\r\nfor four years.\r\n\r\nKartinkin stood holding his arms close to his sides and moving his lips.\r\nBotchkova seemed perfectly calm. Maslova, when she heard the sentence,\r\nblushed scarlet. "I\'m not guilty, not guilty!" she suddenly cried, so\r\nthat it resounded through the room. "It is a sin! I am not guilty! I\r\nnever wished--I never thought! It is the truth I am saying--the truth!"\r\nand sinking on the bench she burst into tears and sobbed aloud. When\r\nKartinkin and Botchkova went out she still sat crying, so that a\r\ngendarme had to touch the sleeve of her cloak.\r\n\r\n"No; it is impossible to leave it as it is," said Nekhludoff to himself,\r\nutterly forgetting his bad thoughts. He did not know why he wished to\r\nlook at her once more, but hurried out into the corridor. There was\r\nquite a crowd at the door. The advocates and jury were going out,\r\npleased to have finished the business, and he was obliged to wait a few\r\nseconds, and when he at last got out into the corridor she was far\r\nin front. He hurried along the corridor after her, regardless of the\r\nattention he was arousing, caught her up, passed her, and stopped. She\r\nhad ceased crying and only sobbed, wiping her red, discoloured face with\r\nthe end of the kerchief on her head. She passed without noticing him.\r\nThen he hurried back to see the president. The latter had already left\r\nthe court, and Nekhludoff followed him into the lobby and went up to\r\nhim just as he had put on his light grey overcoat and was taking the\r\nsilver-mounted walking-stick which an attendant was handing him.\r\n\r\n"Sir, may I have a few words with you concerning some business I have\r\njust decided upon?" said Nekhludoff. "I am one of the jury."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly, Prince Nekhludoff. I shall be delighted. I think we\r\nhave met before," said the president, pressing Nekhludoff\'s hand and\r\nrecalling with pleasure the evening when he first met Nekhludoff, and\r\nwhen he had danced so gaily, better than all the young people. "What can\r\nI do for you?"\r\n\r\n"There is a mistake in the answer concerning Maslova. She is not guilty\r\nof the poisoning and yet she is condemned to penal servitude," said\r\nNekhludoff, with a preoccupied and gloomy air.\r\n\r\n"The Court passed the sentence in accordance with the answers you\r\nyourselves gave," said the president, moving towards the front door;\r\n"though they did not seem to be quite in accord." And he remembered\r\nthat he had been going to explain to the jury that a verdict of "guilty"\r\nmeant guilty of intentional murder unless the words "without intent to\r\ntake life" were added, but had, in his hurry to get the business over,\r\nomitted to do so.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but could not the mistake be rectified?"\r\n\r\n"A reason for an appeal can always be found. You will have to speak to\r\nan advocate," said the president, putting on his hat a little to one\r\nside and continuing to move towards the door.\r\n\r\n"But this is terrible."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, there were two possibilities before Maslova," said the\r\npresident, evidently wishing to be as polite and pleasant to Nekhludoff\r\nas he could. Then, having arranged his whiskers over his coat collar, he\r\nput his hand lightly under Nekhludoff\'s elbow, and, still directing his\r\nsteps towards the front door, he said, "You are going, too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Nekhludoff, quickly getting his coat, and following him.\r\n\r\nThey went out into the bright, merry sunlight, and had to raise their\r\nvoices because of the rattling of the wheels on the pavement.\r\n\r\n"The situation is a curious one, you see," said the president; "what lay\r\nbefore this Maslova was one of two things: either to be almost acquitted\r\nand only imprisoned for a short time, or, taking the preliminary\r\nconfinement into consideration, perhaps not at all--or Siberia. There is\r\nnothing between. Had you but added the words, \'without intent to cause\r\ndeath,\' she would have been acquitted."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was inexcusable of me to omit that," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"That\'s where the whole matter lies," said the president, with a smile,\r\nand looked at his watch. He had only three-quarters of an hour left\r\nbefore the time appointed by his Clara would elapse.\r\n\r\n"Now, if you like to speak to the advocates you\'ll have to find a reason\r\nfor an appeal; that can be easily done." Then, turning to an isvostchik,\r\nhe called out, "To the Dvoryanskaya 30 copecks; I never give more."\r\n\r\n"All right, your honour; here you are."\r\n\r\n"Good-afternoon. If I can be of any use, my address is House Dvornikoff,\r\non the Dvoryanskaya; it\'s easy to remember." And he bowed in a friendly\r\nmanner as he got into the trap and drove off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF CONSULTS AN ADVOCATE.\r\n\r\nHis conversation with the president and the fresh air quieted Nekhludoff\r\na little. He now thought that the feelings experienced by him had been\r\nexaggerated by the unusual surroundings in which he had spent the whole\r\nof the morning, and by that wonderful and startling coincidence. Still,\r\nit was absolutely necessary to take some steps to lighten Maslova\'s\r\nfate, and to take them quickly. "Yes, at once! It will be best to find\r\nout here in the court where the advocate Fanarin or Mikishin lives."\r\nThese were two well-known advocates whom Nekhludoff called to mind. He\r\nreturned to the court, took off his overcoat, and went upstairs. In the\r\nfirst corridor he met Fanarin himself. He stopped him, and told him that\r\nhe was just going to look him up on a matter of business.\r\n\r\nFanarin knew Nekhludoff by sight and name, and said he would be very\r\nglad to be of service to him.\r\n\r\n"Though I am rather tired, still, if your business will not take very\r\nlong, perhaps you might tell me what it is now. Will you step in here?"\r\nAnd he led Nekhludoff into a room, probably some judge\'s cabinet. They\r\nsat down by the table.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what is your business?"\r\n\r\n"First of all, I must ask you to keep the business private. I do not\r\nwant it known that I take an interest in the affair."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that of course. Well?"\r\n\r\n"I was on the jury to-day, and we have condemned a woman to Siberia,\r\nan innocent woman. This bothers me very much." Nekhludoff, to his own\r\nsurprise, blushed and became confused. Fanarin glanced at him rapidly,\r\nand looked down again, listening.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"We have condemned a woman, and I should like to appeal to a higher\r\ncourt."\r\n\r\n"To the Senate, you mean," said Fanarin, correcting him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I should like to ask you to take the case in hand." Nekhludoff\r\nwanted to get the most difficult part over, and added, "I shall take the\r\ncosts of the case on myself, whatever they may be."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we shall settle all that," said the advocate, smiling with\r\ncondescension at Nekhludoff\'s inexperience in these matters. "What is\r\nthe case?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stated what had happened.\r\n\r\n"All right. I shall look the case through to-morrow or the day\r\nafter--no--better on Thursday. If you will come to me at six o\'clock I\r\nwill give you an answer. Well, and now let us go; I have to make a few\r\ninquiries here."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff took leave of him and went out. This talk with the advocate,\r\nand the fact that he had taken measures for Maslova\'s defence, quieted\r\nhim still further. He went out into the street. The weather was\r\nbeautiful, and he joyfully drew in a long breath of spring air. He was\r\nat once surrounded by isvostchiks offering their services, but he went\r\non foot. A whole swarm of pictures and memories of Katusha and his\r\nconduct to her began whirling in his brain, and he felt depressed and\r\neverything appeared gloomy. "No, I shall consider all this later on; I\r\nmust now get rid of all these disagreeable impressions," he thought to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the Korchagin\'s dinner and looked at his watch. It was\r\nnot yet too late to get there in time. He heard the ring of a passing\r\ntramcar, ran to catch it, and jumped on. He jumped off again when they\r\ngot to the market-place, took a good isvostchik, and ten minutes later\r\nwas at the entrance of the Korchagins\' big house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF KORCHAGIN.\r\n\r\n"Please to walk in, your excellency," said the friendly, fat doorkeeper\r\nof the Korchagins\' big house, opening the door, which moved noiselessly\r\non its patent English hinges; "you are expected. They are at dinner.\r\nMy orders were to admit only you." The doorkeeper went as far as the\r\nstaircase and rang.\r\n\r\n"Are there any strangers?" asked Nekhludoff, taking off his overcoat.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Kolosoff and Michael Sergeivitch only, besides the family."\r\n\r\nA very handsome footman with whiskers, in a swallow-tail coat and white\r\ngloves, looked down from the landing.\r\n\r\n"Please to walk up, your excellency," he said. "You are expected."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went up and passed through the splendid large dancing-room,\r\nwhich he knew so well, into the dining-room. There the whole Korchagin\r\nfamily--except the mother, Sophia Vasilievna, who never left her\r\ncabinet--were sitting round the table. At the head of the table sat old\r\nKorchagin; on his left the doctor, and on his right, a visitor, Ivan\r\nIvanovitch Kolosoff, a former Marechal de Noblesse, now a bank director,\r\nKorchagin\'s friend and a Liberal. Next on the left side sat Miss Rayner,\r\nthe governess of Missy\'s little sister, and the four-year-old girl\r\nherself. Opposite them, Missy\'s brother, Petia, the only son of the\r\nKorchagins, a public-school boy of the Sixth Class. It was because of\r\nhis examinations that the whole family were still in town. Next to\r\nhim sat a University student who was coaching him, and Missy\'s cousin,\r\nMichael Sergeivitch Telegin, generally called Misha; opposite him,\r\nKaterina Alexeevna, a 40-year-old maiden lady, a Slavophil; and at the\r\nfoot of the table sat Missy herself, with an empty place by her side.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s right! Sit down. We are still at the fish," said old\r\nKorchagin with difficulty, chewing carefully with his false teeth,\r\nand lifting his bloodshot eyes (which had no visible lids to them) to\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Stephen!" he said, with his mouth full, addressing the stout, dignified\r\nbutler, and pointing with his eyes to the empty place. Though Nekhludoff\r\nknew Korchagin very well, and had often seen him at dinner, to-day this\r\nred face with the sensual smacking lips, the fat neck above the napkin\r\nstuck into his waistcoat, and the whole over-fed military figure, struck\r\nhim very disagreeably. Then Nekhludoff remembered, without wishing to,\r\nwhat he knew of the cruelty of this man, who, when in command, used\r\nto have men flogged, and even hanged, without rhyme or reason, simply\r\nbecause he was rich and had no need to curry favour.\r\n\r\n"Immediately, your excellency," said Stephen, getting a large soup ladle\r\nout of the sideboard, which was decorated with a number of silver vases.\r\nHe made a sign with his head to the handsome footman, who began at once\r\nto arrange the untouched knives and forks and the napkin, elaborately\r\nfolded with the embroidered family crest uppermost, in front of the\r\nempty place next to Missy. Nekhludoff went round shaking hands with\r\nevery one, and all, except old Korchagin and the ladies, rose when he\r\napproached. And this walk round the table, this shaking the hands of\r\npeople, with many of whom he never talked, seemed unpleasant and odd. He\r\nexcused himself for being late, and was about to sit down between Missy\r\nand Katerina Alexeevna, but old Korchagin insisted that if he would not\r\ntake a glass of vodka he should at least take a bit of something to whet\r\nhis appetite, at the side table, on which stood small dishes of lobster,\r\ncaviare, cheese, and salt herrings. Nekhludoff did not know how hungry\r\nhe was until he began to eat, and then, having taken some bread and\r\ncheese, he went on eating eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you succeeded in undermining the basis of society?"\r\nasked Kolosoff, ironically quoting an expression used by a retrograde\r\nnewspaper in attacking trial by jury. "Acquitted the culprits and\r\ncondemned the innocent, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Undermining the basis--undermining the basis," repeated Prince\r\nKorchagin, laughing. He had a firm faith in the wisdom and learning of\r\nhis chosen friend and companion.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of seeming rude, Nekhludoff left Kolosoff\'s question\r\nunanswered, and sitting down to his steaming soup, went on eating.\r\n\r\n"Do let him eat," said Missy, with a smile. The pronoun him she used as\r\na reminder of her intimacy with Nekhludoff. Kolosoff went on in a loud\r\nvoice and lively manner to give the contents of the article against\r\ntrial by jury which had aroused his indignation. Missy\'s cousin, Michael\r\nSergeivitch, endorsed all his statements, and related the contents of\r\nanother article in the same paper. Missy was, as usual, very distinguee,\r\nand well, unobtrusively well, dressed.\r\n\r\n"You must be terribly tired," she said, after waiting until Nekhludoff\r\nhad swallowed what was in his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Not particularly. And you? Have you been to look at the pictures?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"No, we put that off. We have been playing tennis at the Salamatoffs\'.\r\nIt is quite true, Mr. Crooks plays remarkably well."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had come here in order to distract his thoughts, for he\r\nused to like being in this house, both because its refined luxury had a\r\npleasant effect on him and because of the atmosphere of tender flattery\r\nthat unobtrusively surrounded him. But to-day everything in the house\r\nwas repulsive to him--everything: beginning with the doorkeeper, the\r\nbroad staircase, the flowers, the footman, the table decorations, up to\r\nMissy herself, who to-day seemed unattractive and affected. Kolosoff\'s\r\nself-assured, trivial tone of liberalism was unpleasant, as was also the\r\nsensual, self-satisfied, bull-like appearance of old Korchagin, and the\r\nFrench phrases of Katerina Alexeevna, the Slavophil. The constrained\r\nlooks of the governess and the student were unpleasant, too, but most\r\nunpleasant of all was the pronoun _him_ that Missy had used. Nekhludoff\r\nhad long been wavering between two ways of regarding Missy; sometimes he\r\nlooked at her as if by moonlight, and could see in her nothing but what\r\nwas beautiful, fresh, pretty, clever and natural; then suddenly, as\r\nif the bright sun shone on her, he saw her defects and could not help\r\nseeing them. This was such a day for him. To-day he saw all the wrinkles\r\nof her face, knew which of her teeth were false, saw the way her hair\r\nwas crimped, the sharpness of her elbows, and, above all, how large her\r\nthumb-nail was and how like her father\'s.\r\n\r\n"Tennis is a dull game," said Kolosoff; "we used to play lapta when we\r\nwere children. That was much more amusing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, you never tried it; it\'s awfully interesting," said Missy,\r\nlaying, it seemed to Nekhludoff, a very affected stress on the word\r\n"awfully." Then a dispute arose in which Michael Sergeivitch, Katerina\r\nAlexeevna and all the others took part, except the governess, the\r\nstudent and the children, who sat silent and wearied.\r\n\r\n"Oh, these everlasting disputes!" said old Korchagin, laughing, and he\r\npulled the napkin out of his waistcoat, noisily pushed back his chair,\r\nwhich the footman instantly caught hold of, and left the table.\r\n\r\nEverybody rose after him, and went up to another table on which stood\r\nglasses of scented water. They rinsed their mouths, then resumed the\r\nconversation, interesting to no one.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think so?" said Missy to Nekhludoff, calling for a\r\nconfirmation of the statement that nothing shows up a man\'s character\r\nlike a game. She noticed that preoccupied and, as it seemed to her,\r\ndissatisfied look which she feared, and she wanted to find out what had\r\ncaused it.\r\n\r\n"Really, I can\'t tell; I have never thought about it," Nekhludoff\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n"Will you come to mamma?" asked Missy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he said, in a tone which plainly proved that he did not want\r\nto go, and took out a cigarette.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in silence, with a questioning look, and he felt\r\nashamed. "To come into a house and give the people the dumps," he\r\nthought about himself; then, trying to be amiable, said that he would go\r\nwith pleasure if the princess would admit him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! Mamma will be pleased. You may smoke there; and Ivan\r\nIvanovitch is also there."\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the house, Princess Sophia Vasilievna, was a recumbent\r\nlady. It was the eighth year that, when visitors were present, she lay\r\nin lace and ribbons, surrounded with velvet, gilding, ivory, bronze,\r\nlacquer and flowers, never going out, and only, as she put it, receiving\r\nintimate friends, i.e., those who according to her idea stood out from\r\nthe common herd.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was admitted into the number of these friends because he was\r\nconsidered clever, because his mother had been an intimate friend of the\r\nfamily, and because it was desirable that Missy should marry him.\r\n\r\nSophia Vasilievna\'s room lay beyond the large and the small\r\ndrawing-rooms. In the large drawing-room, Missy, who was in front of\r\nNekhludoff, stopped resolutely, and taking hold of the back of a small\r\ngreen chair, faced him.\r\n\r\nMissy was very anxious to get married, and as he was a suitable match\r\nand she also liked him, she had accustomed herself to the thought that\r\nhe should be hers (not she his). To lose him would be very mortifying.\r\nShe now began talking to him in order to get him to explain his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n"I see something has happened," she said. "Tell me, what is the matter\r\nwith you?"\r\n\r\nHe remembered the meeting in the law court, and frowned and blushed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, something has happened," he said, wishing to be truthful; "a very\r\nunusual and serious event."\r\n\r\n"What is it, then? Can you not tell me what it is?" She was pursuing her\r\naim with that unconscious yet obstinate cunning often observable in the\r\nmentally diseased.\r\n\r\n"Not now. Please do not ask me to tell you. I have not yet had time\r\nfully to consider it," and he blushed still more.\r\n\r\n"And so you will not tell me?" A muscle twitched in her face and she\r\npushed back the chair she was holding. "Well then, come!" She shook her\r\nhead as if to expel useless thoughts, and, faster than usual, went on in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nHe fancied that her mouth was unnaturally compressed in order to keep\r\nback the tears. He was ashamed of having hurt her, and yet he knew that\r\nthe least weakness on his part would mean disaster, i.e., would bind\r\nhim to her. And to-day he feared this more than anything, and silently\r\nfollowed her to the princess\'s cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMISSY\'S MOTHER.\r\n\r\nPrincess Sophia Vasilievna, Missy\'s mother, had finished her very\r\nelaborate and nourishing dinner. (She had it always alone, that no one\r\nshould see her performing this unpoetical function.) By her couch stood\r\na small table with her coffee, and she was smoking a pachitos. Princess\r\nSophia Vasilievna was a long, thin woman, with dark hair, large black\r\neyes and long teeth, and still pretended to be young.\r\n\r\nHer intimacy with the doctor was being talked about. Nekhludoff had\r\nknown that for some time; but when he saw the doctor sitting by her\r\ncouch, his oily, glistening beard parted in the middle, he not only\r\nremembered the rumours about them, but felt greatly disgusted. By\r\nthe table, on a low, soft, easy chair, next to Sophia Vasilievna, sat\r\nKolosoff, stirring his coffee. A glass of liqueur stood on the table.\r\nMissy came in with Nekhludoff, but did not remain in the room.\r\n\r\n"When mamma gets tired of you and drives you away, then come to me,"\r\nshe said, turning to Kolosoff and Nekhludoff, speaking as if nothing had\r\noccurred; then she went away, smiling merrily and stepping noiselessly\r\non the thick carpet.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, dear friend? Sit down and talk," said Princess Sophia\r\nVasilievna, with her affected but very naturally-acted smile, showing\r\nher fine, long teeth--a splendid imitation of what her own had\r\nonce been. "I hear that you have come from the Law Courts very much\r\ndepressed. I think it must be very trying to a person with a heart," she\r\nadded in French.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is so," said Nekhludoff. "One often feels one\'s own de--one\r\nfeels one has no right to judge."\r\n\r\n"Comme, c\'est vrai," she cried, as if struck by the truth of this\r\nremark. She was in the habit of artfully flattering all those with whom\r\nshe conversed. "Well, and what of your picture? It does interest me so.\r\nIf I were not such a sad invalid I should have been to see it long ago,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"I have quite given it up," Nekhludoff replied drily. The falseness of\r\nher flattery seemed as evident to him to-day as her age, which she was\r\ntrying to conceal, and he could not put himself into the right state to\r\nbehave politely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that _is_ a pity! Why, he has a real talent for art; I have it from\r\nRepin\'s own lips," she added, turning to Kolosoff.\r\n\r\n"Why is it she is not ashamed of lying so?" Nekhludoff thought, and\r\nfrowned.\r\n\r\nWhen she had convinced herself that Nekhludoff was in a bad temper and\r\nthat one could not get him into an agreeable and clever conversation,\r\nSophia Vasilievna turned to Kolosoff, asking his opinion of a new play.\r\nShe asked it in a tone as if Kolosoff\'s opinion would decide all doubts,\r\nand each word of this opinion be worthy of being immortalised. Kolosoff\r\nfound fault both with the play and its author, and that led him to\r\nexpress his views on art. Princess Sophia Vasilievna, while trying at\r\nthe same time to defend the play, seemed impressed by the truth of his\r\narguments, either giving in at once, or at least modifying her opinion.\r\nNekhludoff looked and listened, but neither saw nor heard what was going\r\non before him.\r\n\r\nListening now to Sophia Vasilievna, now to Kolosoff, Nekhludoff noticed\r\nthat neither he nor she cared anything about the play or each other, and\r\nthat if they talked it was only to gratify the physical desire to\r\nmove the muscles of the throat and tongue after having eaten; and that\r\nKolosoff, having drunk vodka, wine and liqueur, was a little tipsy.\r\nNot tipsy like the peasants who drink seldom, but like people to\r\nwhom drinking wine has become a habit. He did not reel about or talk\r\nnonsense, but he was in a state that was not normal; excited and\r\nself-satisfied. Nekhludoff also noticed that during the conversation\r\nPrincess Sophia Vasilievna kept glancing uneasily at the window, through\r\nwhich a slanting ray of sunshine, which might vividly light up her aged\r\nface, was beginning to creep up.\r\n\r\n"How true," she said in reference to some remark of Kolosoff\'s, touching\r\nthe button of an electric bell by the side of her couch. The doctor\r\nrose, and, like one who is at home, left the room without saying\r\nanything. Sophia Vasilievna followed him with her eyes and continued the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"Please, Philip, draw these curtains," she said, pointing to the window,\r\nwhen the handsome footman came in answer to the bell. "No; whatever you\r\nmay say, there is some mysticism in him; without mysticism there can be\r\nno poetry," she said, with one of her black eyes angrily following the\r\nfootman\'s movements as he was drawing the curtains. "Without poetry,\r\nmysticism is superstition; without mysticism, poetry is--prose," she\r\ncontinued, with a sorrowful smile, still not losing sight of the footman\r\nand the curtains. "Philip, not that curtain; the one on the large\r\nwindow," she exclaimed, in a suffering tone. Sophia Vasilievna was\r\nevidently pitying herself for having to make the effort of saying these\r\nwords; and, to soothe her feelings, she raised to her lips a scented,\r\nsmoking cigarette with her jewel-bedecked fingers.\r\n\r\nThe broad-chested, muscular, handsome Philip bowed slightly, as\r\nif begging pardon; and stepping lightly across the carpet with his\r\nbroad-calved, strong, legs, obediently and silently went to the other\r\nwindow, and, looking at the princess, carefully began to arrange the\r\ncurtain so that not a single ray dared fall on her. But again he did\r\nnot satisfy her, and again she had to interrupt the conversation about\r\nmysticism, and correct in a martyred tone the unintelligent Philip,\r\nwho was tormenting her so pitilessly. For a moment a light flashed in\r\nPhilip\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"\'The devil take you! What do you want?\' was probably what he said to\r\nhimself," thought Nekhludoff, who had been observing all this scene. But\r\nthe strong, handsome Philip at once managed to conceal the signs of his\r\nimpatience, and went on quietly carrying out the orders of the worn,\r\nweak, false Sophia Vasilievna.\r\n\r\n"Of course, there is a good deal of truth in Lombroso\'s teaching," said\r\nKolosoff, lolling back in the low chair and looking at Sophia Vasilievna\r\nwith sleepy eyes; "but he over-stepped the mark. Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"And you? Do you believe in heredity?" asked Sophia Vasilievna, turning\r\nto Nekhludoff, whose silence annoyed her. "In heredity?" he asked. "No,\r\nI don\'t." At this moment his whole mind was taken up by strange images\r\nthat in some unaccountable way rose up in his imagination. By the side\r\nof this strong and handsome Philip he seemed at this minute to see the\r\nnude figure of Kolosoff as an artist\'s model; with his stomach like a\r\nmelon, his bald head, and his arms without muscle, like pestles. In the\r\nsame dim way the limbs of Sophia Vasilievna, now covered with silks and\r\nvelvets, rose up in his mind as they must be in reality; but this mental\r\npicture was too horrid and he tried to drive it away.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know Missy is waiting for you," she said. "Go and find her.\r\nShe wants to play a new piece by Grieg to you; it is most interesting."\r\n\r\n"She did not mean to play anything; the woman is simply lying, for\r\nsome reason or other," thought Nekhludoff, rising and pressing Sophia\r\nVasilievna\'s transparent and bony, ringed hand.\r\n\r\nKaterina Alexeevna met him in the drawing-room, and at once began, in\r\nFrench, as usual:\r\n\r\n"I see the duties of a juryman act depressingly upon you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; pardon me, I am in low spirits to-day, and have no right to weary\r\nothers by my presence," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Why are you in low spirits?"\r\n\r\n"Allow me not to speak about that," he said, looking round for his hat.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember how you used to say that we must always tell the\r\ntruth? And what cruel truths you used to tell us all! Why do you not\r\nwish to speak out now? Don\'t you remember, Missy?" she said, turning to\r\nMissy, who had just come in.\r\n\r\n"We were playing a game then," said Nekhludoff, seriously; "one may\r\ntell the truth in a game, but in reality we are so bad--I mean I am so\r\nbad--that I, at least, cannot tell the truth."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do not correct yourself, but rather tell us why _we_ are so bad,"\r\nsaid Katerina Alexeevna, playing with her words and pretending not to\r\nnotice how serious Nekhludoff was.\r\n\r\n"Nothing is worse than to confess to being in low spirits," said Missy.\r\n"I never do it, and therefore am always in good spirits."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt as a horse must feel when it is being caressed to make\r\nit submit to having the bit put in its mouth and be harnessed, and\r\nto-day he felt less than ever inclined to draw.\r\n\r\n"Well, are you coming into my room? We will try to cheer you up."\r\n\r\nHe excused himself, saying he had to be at home, and began taking leave.\r\nMissy kept his hand longer than usual.\r\n\r\n"Remember that what is important to you is important to your friends,"\r\nshe said. "Are you coming tomorrow?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly expect to," said Nekhludoff; and feeling ashamed, without\r\nknowing whether for her or for himself, he blushed and went away.\r\n\r\n"What is it? _Comme cela m\'intrigue_," said Katerina Alexeevna. "I must\r\nfind it out. I suppose it is some _affaire d\'amour propre; il est tres\r\nsusceptible, notre cher Mitia_."\r\n\r\n"_Plutot une affaire d\'amour sale_," Missy was going to say, but stopped\r\nand looked down with a face from which all the light had gone--a very\r\ndifferent face from the one with which she had looked at him. She would\r\nnot mention to Katerina Alexeevna even, so vulgar a pun, but only said,\r\n"We all have our good and our bad days."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that he, too, will deceive?" she thought; "after all\r\nthat has happened it would be very bad of him."\r\n\r\nIf Missy had had to explain what she meant by "after all that has\r\nhappened," she could have said nothing definite, and yet she knew that\r\nhe had not only excited her hopes but had almost given her a promise. No\r\ndefinite words had passed between them--only looks and smiles and hints;\r\nand yet she considered him as her own, and to lose him would be very\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING.\r\n\r\n"Shameful and stupid, horrid and shameful!" Nekhludoff kept saying to\r\nhimself, as he walked home along the familiar streets. The depression\r\nhe had felt whilst speaking to Missy would not leave him. He felt that,\r\nlooking at it externally, as it were, he was in the right, for he had\r\nnever said anything to her that could be considered binding, never made\r\nher an offer; but he knew that in reality he had bound himself to her,\r\nhad promised to be hers. And yet to-day he felt with his whole being\r\nthat he could not marry her.\r\n\r\n"Shameful and horrid, horrid and shameful!" he repeated to himself, with\r\nreference not only to his relations with Missy but also to the rest.\r\n"Everything is horrid and shameful," he muttered, as he stepped into the\r\nporch of his house. "I am not going to have any supper," he said to\r\nhis manservant Corney, who followed him into the dining-room, where the\r\ncloth was laid for supper and tea. "You may go."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Corney, yet he did not go, but began clearing the\r\nsupper off the table. Nekhludoff looked at Corney with a feeling\r\nof ill-will. He wished to be left alone, and it seemed to him that\r\neverybody was bothering him in order to spite him. When Corney had gone\r\naway with the supper things, Nekhludoff moved to the tea urn and\r\nwas about to make himself some tea, but hearing Agraphena Petrovna\'s\r\nfootsteps, he went hurriedly into the drawing-room, to avoid being seen\r\nby her, and shut the door after him. In this drawing-room his mother had\r\ndied three months before. On entering the room, in which two lamps with\r\nreflectors were burning, one lighting up his father\'s and the other his\r\nmother\'s portrait, he remembered what his last relations with his mother\r\nhad been. And they also seemed shameful and horrid. He remembered how,\r\nduring the latter period of her illness, he had simply wished her to\r\ndie. He had said to himself that he wished it for her sake, that she\r\nmight be released from her suffering, but in reality he wished to be\r\nreleased from the sight of her sufferings for his own sake.\r\n\r\nTrying to recall a pleasant image of her, he went up to look at her\r\nportrait, painted by a celebrated artist for 800 roubles. She was\r\ndepicted in a very low-necked black velvet dress. There was something\r\nvery revolting and blasphemous in this representation of his mother as\r\na half-nude beauty. It was all the more disgusting because three months\r\nago, in this very room, lay this same woman, dried up to a mummy. And he\r\nremembered how a few days before her death she clasped his hand with her\r\nbony, discoloured fingers, looked into his eyes, and said: "Do not judge\r\nme, Mitia, if I have not done what I should," and how the tears came\r\ninto her eyes, grown pale with suffering.\r\n\r\n"Ah, how horrid!" he said to himself, looking up once more at the\r\nhalf-naked woman, with the splendid marble shoulders and arms, and the\r\ntriumphant smile on her lips. "Oh, how horrid!" The bared shoulders of\r\nthe portrait reminded him of another, a young woman, whom he had seen\r\nexposed in the same way a few days before. It was Missy, who had devised\r\nan excuse for calling him into her room just as she was ready to go to\r\na ball, so that he should see her in her ball dress. It was with disgust\r\nthat he remembered her fine shoulders and arms. "And that father of\r\nhers, with his doubtful past and his cruelties, and the bel-esprit her\r\nmother, with her doubtful reputation." All this disgusted him, and also\r\nmade him feel ashamed. "Shameful and horrid; horrid and shameful!"\r\n\r\n"No, no," he thought; "freedom from all these false relations with the\r\nKorchagins and Mary Vasilievna and the inheritance and from all the rest\r\nmust be got. Oh, to breathe freely, to go abroad, to Rome and work at\r\nmy picture!" He remembered the doubts he had about his talent for art.\r\n"Well, never mind; only just to breathe freely. First Constantinople,\r\nthen Rome. Only just to get through with this jury business, and arrange\r\nwith the advocate first."\r\n\r\nThen suddenly there arose in his mind an extremely vivid picture of a\r\nprisoner with black, slightly-squinting eyes, and how she began to cry\r\nwhen the last words of the prisoners had been heard; and he hurriedly\r\nput out his cigarette, pressing it into the ash-pan, lit another, and\r\nbegan pacing up and down the room. One after another the scenes he had\r\nlived through with her rose in his mind. He recalled that last interview\r\nwith her. He remembered the white dress and blue sash, the early mass.\r\n"Why, I loved her, really loved her with a good, pure love, that night;\r\nI loved her even before: yes, I loved her when I lived with my aunts the\r\nfirst time and was writing my composition." And he remembered himself as\r\nhe had been then. A breath of that freshness, youth and fulness of life\r\nseemed to touch him, and he grew painfully sad. The difference between\r\nwhat he had been then and what he was now, was enormous--just as great,\r\nif not greater than the difference between Katusha in church that night,\r\nand the prostitute who had been carousing with the merchant and whom\r\nthey judged this morning. Then he was free and fearless, and innumerable\r\npossibilities lay ready to open before him; now he felt himself caught\r\nin the meshes of a stupid, empty, valueless, frivolous life, out of\r\nwhich he saw no means of extricating himself even if he wished to,\r\nwhich he hardly did. He remembered how proud he was at one time of\r\nhis straightforwardness, how he had made a rule of always speaking the\r\ntruth, and really had been truthful; and how he was now sunk deep in\r\nlies: in the most dreadful of lies--lies considered as the truth by all\r\nwho surrounded him. And, as far as he could see, there was no way out of\r\nthese lies. He had sunk in the mire, got used to it, indulged himself in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHow was he to break off his relations with Mary Vasilievna and her\r\nhusband in such a way as to be able to look him and his children in the\r\neyes? How disentangle himself from Missy? How choose between the two\r\nopposites--the recognition that holding land was unjust and the heritage\r\nfrom his mother? How atone for his sin against Katusha? This last, at\r\nany rate, could not be left as it was. He could not abandon a woman he\r\nhad loved, and satisfy himself by paying money to an advocate to save\r\nher from hard labour in Siberia. She had not even deserved hard labour.\r\nAtone for a fault by paying money? Had he not then, when he gave her the\r\nmoney, thought he was atoning for his fault?\r\n\r\nAnd he clearly recalled to mind that moment when, having caught her up\r\nin the passage, he thrust the money into her bib and ran away. "Oh, that\r\nmoney!" he thought with the same horror and disgust he had then felt.\r\n"Oh, dear! oh, dear! how disgusting," he cried aloud as he had done\r\nthen. "Only a scoundrel, a knave, could do such a thing. And I am that\r\nknave, that scoundrel!" He went on aloud: "But is it possible?"--he\r\nstopped and stood still--"is it possible that I am really a scoundrel?\r\n. . . Well, who but I?" he answered himself. "And then, is this the only\r\nthing?" he went on, convicting himself. "Was not my conduct towards Mary\r\nVasilievna and her husband base and disgusting? And my position with\r\nregard to money? To use riches considered by me unlawful on the plea\r\nthat they are inherited from my mother? And the whole of my idle,\r\ndetestable life? And my conduct towards Katusha to crown all? Knave and\r\nscoundrel! Let men judge me as they like, I can deceive them; but myself\r\nI cannot deceive."\r\n\r\nAnd, suddenly, he understood that the aversion he had lately, and\r\nparticularly to-day, felt for everybody--the Prince and Sophia\r\nVasilievna and Corney and Missy--was an aversion for himself. And,\r\nstrange to say, in this acknowledgement of his baseness there was\r\nsomething painful yet joyful and quieting.\r\n\r\nMore than once in Nekhludoff\'s life there had been what he called a\r\n"cleansing of the soul." By "cleansing of the soul" he meant a state\r\nof mind in which, after a long period of sluggish inner life, a total\r\ncessation of its activity, he began to clear out all the rubbish that\r\nhad accumulated in his soul, and was the cause of the cessation of the\r\ntrue life. His soul needed cleansing as a watch does. After such an\r\nawakening Nekhludoff always made some rules for himself which he meant\r\nto follow forever after, wrote his diary, and began afresh a life which\r\nhe hoped never to change again. "Turning over a new leaf," he called\r\nit to himself in English. But each time the temptations of the world\r\nentrapped him, and without noticing it he fell again, often lower than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThus he had several times in his life raised and cleansed himself. The\r\nfirst time this happened was during the summer he spent with his aunts;\r\nthat was his most vital and rapturous awakening, and its effects had\r\nlasted some time. Another awakening was when he gave up civil service\r\nand joined the army at war time, ready to sacrifice his life. But here\r\nthe choking-up process was soon accomplished. Then an awakening came\r\nwhen he left the army and went abroad, devoting himself to art.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until this day a long period had elapsed without\r\nany cleansing, and therefore the discord between the demands of his\r\nconscience and the life he was leading was greater than it had ever been\r\nbefore. He was horror-struck when he saw how great the divergence was.\r\nIt was so great and the defilement so complete that he despaired of the\r\npossibility of getting cleansed. "Have you not tried before to perfect\r\nyourself and become better, and nothing has come of it?" whispered the\r\nvoice of the tempter within. "What is the use of trying any more? Are\r\nyou the only one?--All are alike, such is life," whispered the voice.\r\nBut the free spiritual being, which alone is true, alone powerful,\r\nalone eternal, had already awakened in Nekhludoff, and he could not but\r\nbelieve it. Enormous though the distance was between what he wished\r\nto be and what he was, nothing appeared insurmountable to the\r\nnewly-awakened spiritual being.\r\n\r\n"At any cost I will break this lie which binds me and confess\r\neverything, and will tell everybody the truth, and act the truth," he\r\nsaid resolutely, aloud. "I shall tell Missy the truth, tell her I am a\r\nprofligate and cannot marry her, and have only uselessly upset her.\r\nI shall tell Mary Vasilievna. . . Oh, there is nothing to tell her. I\r\nshall tell her husband that I, scoundrel that I am, have been deceiving\r\nhim. I shall dispose of the inheritance in such a way as to acknowledge\r\nthe truth. I shall tell her, Katusha, that I am a scoundrel and have\r\nsinned towards her, and will do all I can to ease her lot. Yes, I will\r\nsee her, and will ask her to forgive me.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will beg her pardon, as children do." . . . He stopped---"will\r\nmarry her if necessary." He stopped again, folded his hands in front of\r\nhis breast as he used to do when a little child, lifted his eyes, and\r\nsaid, addressing some one: "Lord, help me, teach me, come enter within\r\nme and purify me of all this abomination."\r\n\r\nHe prayed, asking God to help him, to enter into him and cleanse him;\r\nand what he was praying for had happened already: the God within him had\r\nawakened his consciousness. He felt himself one with Him, and therefore\r\nfelt not only the freedom, fulness and joy of life, but all the power of\r\nrighteousness. All, all the best that a man could do he felt capable of\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nHis eyes filled with tears as he was saying all this to himself, good\r\nand bad tears: good because they were tears of joy at the awakening\r\nof the spiritual being within him, the being which had been asleep all\r\nthese years; and bad tears because they were tears of tenderness to\r\nhimself at his own goodness.\r\n\r\nHe felt hot, and went to the window and opened it. The window opened\r\ninto a garden. It was a moonlit, quiet, fresh night; a vehicle rattled\r\npast, and then all was still. The shadow of a tall poplar fell on the\r\nground just opposite the window, and all the intricate pattern of its\r\nbare branches was clearly defined on the clean swept gravel. To the left\r\nthe roof of a coach-house shone white in the moonlight, in front the\r\nblack shadow of the garden wall was visible through the tangled branches\r\nof the trees.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff gazed at the roof, the moonlit garden, and the shadows of the\r\npoplar, and drank in the fresh, invigorating air.\r\n\r\n"How delightful, how delightful; oh, God, how delightful," he said,\r\nmeaning that which was going on in his soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA IN PRISON.\r\n\r\nMaslova reached her cell only at six in the evening, tired and footsore,\r\nhaving, unaccustomed as she was to walking, gone 10 miles on the stony\r\nroad that day. She was crushed by the unexpectedly severe sentence and\r\ntormented by hunger. During the first interval of her trial, when the\r\nsoldiers were eating bread and hard-boiled eggs in her presence, her\r\nmouth watered and she realised she was hungry, but considered it beneath\r\nher dignity to beg of them. Three hours later the desire to eat had\r\npassed, and she felt only weak. It was then she received the unexpected\r\nsentence. At first she thought she had made a mistake; she could not\r\nimagine herself as a convict in Siberia, and could not believe what she\r\nheard. But seeing the quiet, business-like faces of judges and jury, who\r\nheard this news as if it were perfectly natural and expected, she grew\r\nindignant, and proclaimed loudly to the whole Court that she was not\r\nguilty. Finding that her cry was also taken as something natural\r\nand expected, and feeling incapable of altering matters, she was\r\nhorror-struck and began to weep in despair, knowing that she must submit\r\nto the cruel and surprising injustice that had been done her. What\r\nastonished her most was that young men--or, at any rate, not old\r\nmen--the same men who always looked so approvingly at her (one of them,\r\nthe public prosecutor, she had seen in quite a different humour) had\r\ncondemned her. While she was sitting in the prisoners\' room before the\r\ntrial and during the intervals, she saw these men looking in at the open\r\ndoor pretending they had to pass there on some business, or enter the\r\nroom and gaze on her with approval. And then, for some unknown reason,\r\nthese same men had condemned her to hard labour, though she was innocent\r\nof the charge laid against her. At first she cried, but then quieted\r\ndown and sat perfectly stunned in the prisoners\' room, waiting to be led\r\nback. She wanted only two things now--tobacco and strong drink. In this\r\nstate Botchkova and Kartinkin found her when they were led into the same\r\nroom after being sentenced. Botchkova began at once to scold her, and\r\ncall her a "convict."\r\n\r\n"Well! What have you gained? justified yourself, have you? What you have\r\ndeserved, that you\'ve got. Out in Siberia you\'ll give up your finery, no\r\nfear!"\r\n\r\nMaslova sat with her hands inside her sleeves, hanging her head and\r\nlooking in front of her at the dirty floor without moving, only saying:\r\n"I don\'t bother you, so don\'t you bother me. I don\'t bother you, do I?"\r\nshe repeated this several times, and was silent again. She did brighten\r\nup a little when Botchkova and Kartinkin were led away and an attendant\r\nbrought her three roubles.\r\n\r\n"Are you Maslova?" he asked. "Here you are; a lady sent it you," he\r\nsaid, giving her the money.\r\n\r\n"A lady--what lady?"\r\n\r\n"You just take it. I\'m not going to talk to you."\r\n\r\nThis money was sent by Kitaeva, the keeper of the house in which she\r\nused to live. As she was leaving the court she turned to the usher with\r\nthe question whether she might give Maslova a little money. The usher\r\nsaid she might. Having got permission, she removed the three-buttoned\r\nSwedish kid glove from her plump, white hand, and from an elegant purse\r\nbrought from the back folds of her silk skirt took a pile of coupons,\r\n[in Russia coupons cut off interest-bearing papers are often used as\r\nmoney] just cut off from the interest-bearing papers which she had\r\nearned in her establishment, chose one worth 2 roubles and 50 copecks,\r\nadded two 20 and one 10-copeck coins, and gave all this to the usher.\r\nThe usher called an attendant, and in his presence gave the money.\r\n\r\n"Belease to giff it accurately," said Carolina Albertovna Kitaeva.\r\n\r\nThe attendant was hurt by her want of confidence, and that was why he\r\ntreated Maslova so brusquely. Maslova was glad of the money, because\r\nit could give her the only thing she now desired. "If I could but get\r\ncigarettes and take a whiff!" she said to herself, and all her thoughts\r\ncentred on the one desire to smoke and drink. She longed for spirits so\r\nthat she tasted them and felt the strength they would give her; and she\r\ngreedily breathed in the air when the fumes of tobacco reached her from\r\nthe door of a room that opened into the corridor. But she had to wait\r\nlong, for the secretary, who should have given the order for her to go,\r\nforgot about the prisoners while talking and even disputing with one of\r\nthe advocates about the article forbidden by the censor.\r\n\r\nAt last, about five o\'clock, she was allowed to go, and was led away\r\nthrough the back door by her escort, the Nijni man and the Tchoovash.\r\nThen, still within the entrance to the Law Courts, she gave them 50\r\ncopecks, asking them to get her two rolls and some cigarettes. The\r\nTchoovash laughed, took the money, and said, "All right; I\'ll get \'em,"\r\nand really got her the rolls and the cigarettes and honestly returned\r\nthe change. She was not allowed to smoke on the way, and, with her\r\ncraving unsatisfied, she continued her way to the prison. When she was\r\nbrought to the gate of the prison, a hundred convicts who had arrived by\r\nrail were being led in. The convicts, bearded, clean-shaven, old, young,\r\nRussians, foreigners, some with their heads shaved and rattling with the\r\nchains on their feet, filled the anteroom with dust, noise and an acid\r\nsmell of perspiration. Passing Maslova, all the convicts looked at her,\r\nand some came up to her and brushed her as they passed.\r\n\r\n"Ay, here\'s a wench--a fine one," said one.\r\n\r\n"My respects to you, miss," said another, winking at her. One dark man\r\nwith a moustache, the rest of his face and the back of his head clean\r\nshaved, rattling with his chains and catching her feet in them, sprang\r\nnear and embraced her.\r\n\r\n"What! don\'t you know your chum? Come, come; don\'t give yourself airs,"\r\nshowing his teeth and his eyes glittering when she pushed him away.\r\n\r\n"You rascal! what are you up to?" shouted the inspector\'s assistant,\r\ncoming in from behind. The convict shrank back and jumped away. The\r\nassistant assailed Maslova.\r\n\r\n"What are you here for?"\r\n\r\nMaslova was going to say she had been brought back from the Law Courts,\r\nbut she was so tired that she did not care to speak.\r\n\r\n"She has returned from the Law Courts, sir," said one of the soldiers,\r\ncoming forward with his fingers lifted to his cap.\r\n\r\n"Well, hand her over to the chief warder. I won\'t have this sort of\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Sokoloff, take her in!" shouted the assistant inspector.\r\n\r\nThe chief warder came up, gave Maslova a slap on the shoulder, and\r\nmaking a sign with his head for her to follow led her into the corridor\r\nof the women\'s ward. There she was searched, and as nothing prohibited\r\nwas found on her (she had hidden her box of cigarettes inside a roll)\r\nshe was led to the cell she had left in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE CELL.\r\n\r\nThe cell in which Maslova was imprisoned was a large room 21 feet long\r\nand 10 feet broad; it had two windows and a large stove. Two-thirds of\r\nthe space were taken up by shelves used as beds. The planks they were\r\nmade of had warped and shrunk. Opposite the door hung a dark-coloured\r\nicon with a wax candle sticking to it and a bunch of everlastings\r\nhanging down from it. By the door to the right there was a dark spot on\r\nthe floor on which stood a stinking tub. The inspection had taken place\r\nand the women were locked up for the night.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of this room were 15 persons, including three children.\r\nIt was still quite light. Only two of the women were lying down: a\r\nconsumptive woman imprisoned for theft, and an idiot who spent most of\r\nher time in sleep and who was arrested because she had no passport. The\r\nconsumptive woman was not asleep, but lay with wide open eyes, her cloak\r\nfolded under her head, trying to keep back the phlegm that irritated her\r\nthroat, and not to cough.\r\n\r\nSome of the other women, most of whom had nothing on but coarse brown\r\nholland chemises, stood looking out of the window at the convicts down\r\nin the yard, and some sat sewing. Among the latter was the old woman,\r\nKorableva, who had seen Maslova off in the morning. She was a tall,\r\nstrong, gloomy-looking woman; her fair hair, which had begun to turn\r\ngrey on the temples, hung down in a short plait. She was sentenced to\r\nhard labour in Siberia because she had killed her husband with an axe\r\nfor making up to their daughter. She was at the head of the women in\r\nthe cell, and found means of carrying on a trade in spirits with them.\r\nBeside her sat another woman sewing a coarse canvas sack. This was the\r\nwife of a railway watchman, [There are small watchmen\'s cottages at\r\ndistances of about one mile from each other along the Russian railways,\r\nand the watchmen or their wives have to meet every train.] imprisoned\r\nfor three months because she did not come out with the flags to meet a\r\ntrain that was passing, and an accident had occurred. She was a short,\r\nsnub-nosed woman, with small, black eyes; kind and talkative. The third\r\nof the women who were sewing was Theodosia, a quiet young girl, white\r\nand rosy, very pretty, with bright child\'s eyes, and long fair plaits\r\nwhich she wore twisted round her head. She was in prison for attempting\r\nto poison her husband. She had done this immediately after her wedding\r\n(she had been given in marriage without her consent at the age of 16)\r\nbecause her husband would give her no peace. But in the eight months\r\nduring which she had been let out on bail, she had not only made it up\r\nwith her husband, but come to love him, so that when her trial came\r\nthey were heart and soul to one another. Although her husband, her\r\nfather-in-law, but especially her mother-in-law, who had grown very fond\r\nof her, did all they could to get her acquitted, she was sentenced to\r\nhard labour in Siberia. The kind, merry, ever-smiling Theodosia had a\r\nplace next Maslova\'s on the shelf bed, and had grown so fond of her that\r\nshe took it upon herself as a duty to attend and wait on her. Two\r\nother women were sitting without any work at the other end of the shelf\r\nbedstead. One was a woman of about 40, with a pale, thin face, who once\r\nprobably had been very handsome. She sat with her baby at her thin,\r\nwhite breast. The crime she had committed was that when a recruit was,\r\naccording to the peasants\' view, unlawfully taken from their village,\r\nand the people stopped the police officer and took the recruit away from\r\nhim, she (an aunt of the lad unlawfully taken) was the first to catch\r\nhold of the bridle of the horse on which he was being carried off.\r\nThe other, who sat doing nothing, was a kindly, grey-haired old woman,\r\nhunchbacked and with a flat bosom. She sat behind the stove on the\r\nbedshelf, and pretended to catch a fat four-year-old boy, who ran\r\nbackwards and forwards in front of her, laughing gaily. This boy had\r\nonly a little shirt on and his hair was cut short. As he ran past the\r\nold woman he kept repeating, "There, haven\'t caught me!" This old woman\r\nand her son were accused of incendiarism. She bore her imprisonment with\r\nperfect cheerfulness, but was concerned about her son, and chiefly about\r\nher "old man," who she feared would get into a terrible state with no\r\none to wash for him. Besides these seven women, there were four standing\r\nat one of the open windows, holding on to the iron bars. They were\r\nmaking signs and shouting to the convicts whom Maslova had met when\r\nreturning to prison, and who were now passing through the yard. One\r\nof these women was big and heavy, with a flabby body, red hair, and\r\nfreckled on her pale yellow face, her hands, and her fat neck. She\r\nshouted something in a loud, raucous voice, and laughed hoarsely. This\r\nwoman was serving her term for theft. Beside her stood an awkward, dark\r\nlittle woman, no bigger than a child of ten, with a long waist and very\r\nshort legs, a red, blotchy face, thick lips which did not hide her\r\nlong teeth, and eyes too far apart. She broke by fits and starts into\r\nscreeching laughter at what was going on in the yard. She was to be\r\ntried for stealing and incendiarism. They called her Khoroshavka. Behind\r\nher, in a very dirty grey chemise, stood a thin, miserable-looking\r\npregnant woman, who was to be tried for concealment of theft. This woman\r\nstood silent, but kept smiling with pleasure and approval at what was\r\ngoing on below. With these stood a peasant woman of medium height,\r\nthe mother of the boy who was playing with the old woman and of a\r\nseven-year-old girl. These were in prison with her because she had no\r\none to leave them with. She was serving her term of imprisonment for\r\nillicit sale of spirits. She stood a little further from the window\r\nknitting a stocking, and though she listened to the other prisoners\'\r\nwords she shook her head disapprovingly, frowned, and closed her eyes.\r\nBut her seven-year-old daughter stood in her little chemise, her flaxen\r\nhair done up in a little pigtail, her blue eyes fixed, and, holding\r\nthe red-haired woman by the skirt, attentively listened to the words of\r\nabuse that the women and the convicts flung at each other, and repeated\r\nthem softly, as if learning them by heart. The twelfth prisoner, who\r\npaid no attention to what was going on, was a very tall, stately girl,\r\nthe daughter of a deacon, who had drowned her baby in a well. She went\r\nabout with bare feet, wearing only a dirty chemise. The thick, short\r\nplait of her fair hair had come undone and hung down dishevelled, and\r\nshe paced up and down the free space of the cell, not looking at any\r\none, turning abruptly every time she came up to the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nWhen the padlock rattled and the door opened to let Maslova into the\r\ncell, all turned towards her. Even the deacon\'s daughter stopped for a\r\nmoment and looked at her with lifted brows before resuming her steady\r\nstriding up and down.\r\n\r\nKorableva stuck her needle into the brown sacking and looked\r\nquestioningly at Maslova through her spectacles. "Eh, eh, deary me, so\r\nyou have come back. And I felt sure they\'d acquit you. So you\'ve got\r\nit?" She took off her spectacles and put her work down beside her on the\r\nshelf bed.\r\n\r\n"And here have I and the old lady been saying, \'Why, it may well be\r\nthey\'ll let her go free at once.\' Why, it happens, ducky, they\'ll even\r\ngive you a heap of money sometimes, that\'s sure," the watchman\'s wife\r\nbegan, in her singing voice: "Yes, we were wondering, \'Why\'s she so\r\nlong?\' And now just see what it is. Well, our guessing was no use. The\r\nLord willed otherwise," she went on in musical tones.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible? Have they sentenced you?" asked Theodosia, with\r\nconcern, looking at Maslova with her bright blue, child-like eyes; and\r\nher merry young face changed as if she were going to cry.\r\n\r\nMaslova did not answer, but went on to her place, the second from the\r\nend, and sat down beside Korableva.\r\n\r\n"Have you eaten anything?" said Theodosia, rising and coming up to\r\nMaslova.\r\n\r\nMaslova gave no reply, but putting the rolls on the bedstead, took\r\noff her dusty cloak, the kerchief off her curly black head, and began\r\npulling off her shoes. The old woman who had been playing with the boy\r\ncame up and stood in front of Maslova. "Tz, tz, tz," she clicked with\r\nher tongue, shaking her head pityingly. The boy also came up with her,\r\nand, putting out his upper lip, stared with wide open eyes at the roll\r\nMaslova had brought. When Maslova saw the sympathetic faces of her\r\nfellow-prisoners, her lips trembled and she felt inclined to cry, but\r\nshe succeeded in restraining herself until the old woman and the boy\r\ncame up. When she heard the kind, pitying clicking of the old woman\'s\r\ntongue, and met the boy\'s serious eyes turned from the roll to her face,\r\nshe could bear it no longer; her face quivered and she burst into sobs.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you to insist on having a proper advocate?" said\r\nNorableva. "Well, what is it? Exile?"\r\n\r\nMaslova could not answer, but took from inside the roll a box of\r\ncigarettes, on which was a picture of a lady with hair done up very high\r\nand dress cut low in front, and passed the box to Korableva. Korableva\r\nlooked at it and shook her head, chiefly because see did not approve of\r\nMaslova\'s putting her money to such bad use; but still she took out a\r\ncigarette, lit it at the lamp, took a puff, and almost forced it into\r\nMaslova\'s hand. Maslova, still crying, began greedily to inhale the\r\ntobacco smoke. "Penal servitude," she muttered, blowing out the smoke\r\nand sobbing.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they fear the Lord, the cursed soul-slayers?" muttered Korableva,\r\n"sentencing the lass for nothing." At this moment the sound of loud,\r\ncoarse laughter came from the women who were still at the window. The\r\nlittle girl also laughed, and her childish treble mixed with the hoarse\r\nand screeching laughter of the others. One of the convicts outside had\r\ndone something that produced this effect on the onlookers.\r\n\r\n"Lawks! see the shaved hound, what he\'s doing," said the red-haired\r\nwoman, her whole fat body shaking with laughter; and leaning against the\r\ngrating she shouted meaning less obscene words.\r\n\r\n"Ugh, the fat fright\'s cackling," said Korableva, who disliked the\r\nred-haired woman. Then, turning to Maslova again, she asked: "How many\r\nyears?"\r\n\r\n"Four," said Maslova, and the tears ran down her cheeks in such\r\nprofusion that one fell on the cigarette. Maslova crumpled it up angrily\r\nand took another.\r\n\r\nThough the watchman\'s wife did not smoke she picked up the cigarette\r\nMaslova had thrown away and began straightening it out, talking\r\nunceasingly.\r\n\r\n"There, now, ducky, so it\'s true," she said. "Truth\'s gone to the dogs\r\nand they do what they please, and here we were guessing that you\'d go\r\nfree. Norableva says, \'She\'ll go free.\' I say, \'No,\' say I. \'No, dear,\r\nmy heart tells me they\'ll give it her.\' And so it\'s turned out," she\r\nwent on, evidently listening with pleasure to her own voice.\r\n\r\nThe women who had been standing by the window now also came up to\r\nMaslova, the convicts who had amused them having gone away. The first to\r\ncome up were the woman imprisoned for illicit trade in spirits, and her\r\nlittle girl. "Why such a hard sentence?" asked the woman, sitting down\r\nby Maslova and knitting fast.\r\n\r\n"Why so hard? Because there\'s no money. That\'s why! Had there been\r\nmoney, and had a good lawyer that\'s up to their tricks been hired,\r\nthey\'d have acquitted her, no fear," said Korableva. "There\'s\r\nwhat\'s-his-name--that hairy one with the long nose. He\'d bring you out\r\nclean from pitch, mum, he would. Ah, if we\'d only had him!"\r\n\r\n"Him, indeed," said Khoroshavka. "Why, he won\'t spit at you for less\r\nthan a thousand roubles."\r\n\r\n"Seems you\'ve been born under an unlucky star," interrupted the old\r\nwoman who was imprisoned for incendiarism. "Only think, to entice the\r\nlad\'s wife and lock him himself up to feed vermin, and me, too, in my\r\nold days--" she began to retell her story for the hundredth time. "If\r\nit isn\'t the beggar\'s staff it\'s the prison. Yes, the beggar\'s staff and\r\nthe prison don\'t wait for an invitation."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it seems that\'s the way with all of them," said the spirit trader;\r\nand after looking at her little girl she put down her knitting, and,\r\ndrawing the child between her knees, began to search her head with deft\r\nfingers. "Why do you sell spirits?" she went on. "Why? but what\'s one to\r\nfeed the children on?"\r\n\r\nThese words brought back to Maslova\'s mind her craving for drink.\r\n\r\n"A little vodka," she said to Korableva, wiping the tears with her\r\nsleeve and sobbing less frequently.\r\n\r\n"All right, fork out," said Korableva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nA PRISON QUARREL.\r\n\r\nMaslova got the money, which she had also hidden in a roll, and passed\r\nthe coupon to Korableva. Korableva accepted it, though she could not\r\nread, trusting to Khoroshavka, who knew everything, and who said that\r\nthe slip of paper was worth 2 roubles 50 copecks, then climbed up to the\r\nventilator, where she had hidden a small flask of vodka. Seeing this,\r\nthe women whose places were further off went away. Meanwhile Maslova\r\nshook the dust out of her cloak and kerchief, got up on the bedstead,\r\nand began eating a roll.\r\n\r\n"I kept your tea for you," said Theodosia, getting down from the shelf\r\na mug and a tin teapot wrapped in a rag, "but I\'m afraid it is quite\r\ncold." The liquid was quite cold and tasted more of tin than of tea, yet\r\nMaslova filled the mug and began drinking it with her roll. "Finashka,\r\nhere you are," she said, breaking off a bit of the roll and giving it to\r\nthe boy, who stood looking at her mouth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Korableva handed the flask of vodka and a mug to Maslova, who\r\noffered some to her and to Khoroshavka. These prisoners were considered\r\nthe aristocracy of the cell because they had some money, and shared what\r\nthey possessed with the others.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Maslova brightened up and related merrily what had\r\nhappened at the court, and what had struck her most, i.e., how all the\r\nmen had followed her wherever she went. In the court they all looked at\r\nher, she said, and kept coming into the prisoners\' room while she was\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"One of the soldiers even says, \'It\'s all to look at you that they\r\ncome.\' One would come in, \'Where is such a paper?\' or something, but I\r\nsee it is not the paper he wants; he just devours me with his eyes," she\r\nsaid, shaking her head. "Regular artists."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s so," said the watchman\'s wife, and ran on in her musical\r\nstrain, "they\'re like flies after sugar."\r\n\r\n"And here, too," Maslova interrupted her, "the same thing. They can\r\ndo without anything else. But the likes of them will go without bread\r\nsooner than miss that! Hardly had they brought me back when in comes a\r\ngang from the railway. They pestered me so, I did not know how to\r\nrid myself of them. Thanks to the assistant, he turned them off. One\r\nbothered so, I hardly got away."\r\n\r\n"What\'s he like?" asked Khoroshevka.\r\n\r\n"Dark, with moustaches."\r\n\r\n"It must be him."\r\n\r\n"Him--who?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Schegloff; him as has just gone by."\r\n\r\n"What\'s he, this Schegloff?"\r\n\r\n"What, she don\'t know Schegloff? Why, he ran twice from Siberia. Now\r\nthey\'ve got him, but he\'ll run away. The warders themselves are afraid\r\nof him," said Khoroshavka, who managed to exchange notes with the male\r\nprisoners and knew all that went on in the prison. "He\'ll run away,\r\nthat\'s flat."\r\n\r\n"If he does go away you and I\'ll have to stay," said Korableva, turning\r\nto Maslova, "but you\'d better tell us now what the advocate says about\r\npetitioning. Now\'s the time to hand it in."\r\n\r\nMaslova answered that she knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the red-haired woman came up to the "aristocracy" with\r\nboth freckled hands in her thick hair, scratching her head with her\r\nnails.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you all about it, Katerina," she began. "First and foremost,\r\nyou\'ll have to write down you\'re dissatisfied with the sentence, then\r\ngive notice to the Procureur."\r\n\r\n"What do you want here?" said Korableva angrily; "smell the vodka, do\r\nyou? Your chatter\'s not wanted. We know what to do without your advice."\r\n\r\n"No one\'s speaking to you; what do you stick your nose in for?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s vodka you want; that\'s why you come wriggling yourself in here."\r\n\r\n"Well, offer her some," said Maslova, always ready to share anything she\r\npossessed with anybody.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll offer her something."\r\n\r\n"Come on then," said the red-haired one, advancing towards Korableva.\r\n"Ah! think I\'m afraid of such as you?"\r\n\r\n"Convict fright!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s her as says it."\r\n\r\n"Slut!"\r\n\r\n"I? A slut? Convict! Murderess!" screamed the red-haired one.\r\n\r\n"Go away, I tell you," said Korableva gloomily, but the red-haired one\r\ncame nearer and Korableva struck her in the chest. The red-haired woman\r\nseemed only to have waited for this, and with a sudden movement caught\r\nhold of Korableva\'s hair with one hand and with the other struck her in\r\nthe face. Korableva seized this hand, and Maslova and Khoroshavka caught\r\nthe red-haired woman by her arms, trying to pull her away, but she let\r\ngo the old woman\'s hair with her hand only to twist it round her fist.\r\nKorableva, with her head bent to one side, was dealing out blows with\r\none arm and trying to catch the red-haired woman\'s hand with her teeth,\r\nwhile the rest of the women crowded round, screaming and trying to\r\nseparate the fighters; even the consumptive one came up and stood\r\ncoughing and watching the fight. The children cried and huddled\r\ntogether. The noise brought the woman warder and a jailer. The fighting\r\nwomen were separated; and Korableva, taking out the bits of torn hair\r\nfrom her head, and the red-haired one, holding her torn chemise together\r\nover her yellow breast, began loudly to complain.\r\n\r\n"I know, it\'s all the vodka. Wait a bit; I\'ll tell the inspector\r\ntomorrow. He\'ll give it you. Can\'t I smell it? Mind, get it all out of\r\nthe way, or it will be the worse for you," said the warder. "We\'ve no\r\ntime to settle your disputes. Get to your places and be quiet."\r\n\r\nBut quiet was not soon re-established. For a long time the women went on\r\ndisputing and explaining to one another whose fault it all was. At last\r\nthe warder and the jailer left the cell, the women grew quieter and\r\nbegan going to bed, and the old woman went to the icon and commenced\r\npraying.\r\n\r\n"The two jailbirds have met," the red-haired woman suddenly called out\r\nin a hoarse voice from the other end of the shelf beds, accompanying\r\nevery word with frightfully vile abuse.\r\n\r\n"Mind you don\'t get it again," Korableva replied, also adding words of\r\nabuse, and both were quiet again.\r\n\r\n"Had I not been stopped I\'d have pulled your damned eyes out," again\r\nbegan the red-haired one, and an answer of the same kind followed from\r\nKorableva. Then again a short interval and more abuse. But the intervals\r\nbecame longer and longer, as when a thunder-cloud is passing, and at\r\nlast all was quiet.\r\n\r\nAll were in bed, some began to snore; and only the old woman, who always\r\nprayed a long time, went on bowing before the icon and the deacon\'s\r\ndaughter, who had got up after the warder left, was pacing up and\r\ndown the room again. Maslova kept thinking that she was now a convict\r\ncondemned to hard labour, and had twice been reminded of this--once by\r\nBotchkova and once by the red-haired woman--and she could not reconcile\r\nherself to the thought. Korableva, who lay next to her, turned over in\r\nher bed.\r\n\r\n"There now," said Maslova in a low voice; "who would have thought it?\r\nSee what others do and get nothing for it."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, girl. People manage to live in Siberia. As for you, you\'ll\r\nnot be lost there either," Korableva said, trying to comfort her.\r\n\r\n"I know I\'ll not be lost; still it is hard. It\'s not such a fate I\r\nwant--I, who am used to a comfortable life."\r\n\r\n"Ah, one can\'t go against God," said Korableva, with a sigh. "One can\'t,\r\nmy dear."\r\n\r\n"I know, granny. Still, it\'s hard."\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a while.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear that baggage?" whispered Korableva, drawing Maslova\'s\r\nattention to a strange sound proceeding from the other end of the room.\r\n\r\nThis sound was the smothered sobbing of the red-haired woman. The\r\nred-haired woman was crying because she had been abused and had not got\r\nany of the vodka she wanted so badly; also because she remembered\r\nhow all her life she had been abused, mocked at, offended, beaten.\r\nRemembering this, she pitied herself, and, thinking no one heard her,\r\nbegan crying as children cry, sniffing with her nose and swallowing the\r\nsalt tears.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry for her," said Maslova.\r\n\r\n"Of course one is sorry," said Korableva, "but she shouldn\'t come\r\nbothering."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LEAVEN AT WORK--NEKHLUDOFF\'S DOMESTIC CHANGES.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Nekhludoff awoke, conscious that something had happened\r\nto him, and even before he had remembered what it was he knew it to be\r\nsomething important and good.\r\n\r\n"Katusha--the trial!" Yes, he must stop lying and tell the whole truth.\r\n\r\nBy a strange coincidence on that very morning he received the\r\nlong-expected letter from Mary Vasilievna, the wife of the Marechal\r\nde Noblesse, the very letter he particularly needed. She gave him full\r\nfreedom, and wished him happiness in his intended marriage.\r\n\r\n"Marriage!" he repeated with irony. "How far I am from all that at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\nAnd he remembered the plans he had formed the day before, to tell\r\nthe husband everything, to make a clean breast of it, and express his\r\nreadiness to give him any kind of satisfaction. But this morning this\r\ndid not seem so easy as the day before. And, then, also, why make a man\r\nunhappy by telling him what he does not know? Yes, if he came and\r\nasked, he would tell him all, but to go purposely and tell--no! that was\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nAnd telling the whole truth to Missy seemed just as difficult this\r\nmorning. Again, he could not begin to speak without offence. As in many\r\nworldly affairs, something had to remain unexpressed. Only one thing he\r\ndecided on, i.e., not to visit there, and to tell the truth if asked.\r\n\r\nBut in connection with Katusha, nothing was to remain unspoken. "I shall\r\ngo to the prison and shall tell her every thing, and ask her to forgive\r\nme. And if need be--yes, if need be, I shall marry her," he thought.\r\n\r\nThis idea, that he was ready to sacrifice all on moral grounds, and\r\nmarry her, again made him feel very tender towards himself. Concerning\r\nmoney matters he resolved this morning to arrange them in accord with\r\nhis conviction, that the holding of landed property was unlawful. Even\r\nif he should not be strong enough to give up everything, he would still\r\ndo what he could, not deceiving himself or others.\r\n\r\nIt was long since he had met the coming day with so much energy. When\r\nAgraphena Petrovna came in, he told her, with more firmness than he\r\nthought himself capable of, that he no longer needed this lodging nor\r\nher services. There had been a tacit understanding that he was keeping\r\nup so large and expensive an establishment because he was thinking of\r\ngetting married. The giving up of the house had, therefore, a special\r\nmeaning. Agraphena Petrovna looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n"I thank you very much, Agraphena Petrovna, for all your care for me,\r\nbut I no longer require so large a house nor so many servants. If you\r\nwish to help me, be so good as to settle about the things, put them away\r\nas it used to be done during mamma\'s life, and when Natasha comes she\r\nwill see to everything." Natasha was Nekhludoff\'s sister.\r\n\r\nAgraphena Petrovna shook her head. "See about the things? Why, they\'ll\r\nbe required again," she said.\r\n\r\n"No, they won\'t, Agraphena Petrovna; I assure you they won\'t be\r\nrequired," said Nekhludoff, in answer to what the shaking of her head\r\nhad expressed. "Please tell Corney also that I shall pay him two months\'\r\nwages, but shall have no further need of him."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity, Dmitri Ivanovitch, that you should think of doing this,"\r\nshe said. "Well, supposing you go abroad, still you\'ll require a place\r\nof residence again."\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken in your thoughts, Agraphena Petrovna; I am not going\r\nabroad. If I go on a journey, it will be to quite a different place."\r\nHe suddenly blushed very red. "Yes, I must tell her," he thought; "no\r\nhiding; everybody must be told."\r\n\r\n"A very strange and important thing happened to me yesterday. Do you\r\nremember my Aunt Mary Ivanovna\'s Katusha?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Why, I taught her how to sew."\r\n\r\n"Well, this Katusha was tried in the Court and I was on the jury."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord! What a pity!" cried Agraphena Petrovna. "What was she being\r\ntried for?"\r\n\r\n"Murder; and it is I have done it all."\r\n\r\n"Well, now this is very strange; how could you do it all?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am the cause of it all; and it is this that has altered all my\r\nplans."\r\n\r\n"What difference can it make to you?"\r\n\r\n"This difference: that I, being the cause of her getting on to that\r\npath, must do all I can to help her."\r\n\r\n"That is just according to your own good pleasure; you are not\r\nparticularly in fault there. It happens to every one, and if one\'s\r\nreasonable, it all gets smoothed over and forgotten," she said,\r\nseriously and severely. "Why should you place it to your account?\r\nThere\'s no need. I had already heard before that she had strayed from\r\nthe right path. Well, whose fault is it?"\r\n\r\n"Mine! that\'s why I want to put it right."\r\n\r\n"It is hard to put right."\r\n\r\n"That is my business. But if you are thinking about yourself, then I\r\nwill tell you that, as mamma expressed the wish--"\r\n\r\n"I am not thinking about myself. I have been so bountifully treated by\r\nthe dear defunct, that I desire nothing. Lisenka" (her married niece)\r\n"has been inviting me, and I shall go to her when I am not wanted any\r\nlonger. Only it is a pity you should take this so to heart; it happens\r\nto everybody."\r\n\r\n"Well, I do not think so. And I still beg that you will help me let this\r\nlodging and put away the things. And please do not be angry with me. I\r\nam very, very grateful to you for all you have done."\r\n\r\nAnd, strangely, from the moment Nekhludoff realised that it was he who\r\nwas so bad and disgusting to himself, others were no longer disgusting\r\nto him; on the contrary, he felt a kindly respect for Agraphena\r\nPetrovna, and for Corney.\r\n\r\nHe would have liked to go and confess to Corney also, but Corney\'s\r\nmanner was so insinuatingly deferential that he had not the resolution\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the Law Courts, passing along the same streets with the\r\nsame isvostchik as the day before, he was surprised what a different\r\nbeing he felt himself to be. The marriage with Missy, which only\r\nyesterday seemed so probable, appeared quite impossible now. The day\r\nbefore he felt it was for him to choose, and had no doubts that she\r\nwould be happy to marry him; to-day he felt himself unworthy not only of\r\nmarrying, but even of being intimate with her. "If she only knew what\r\nI am, nothing would induce her to receive me. And only yesterday I was\r\nfinding fault with her because she flirted with N---. Anyhow, even if\r\nshe consented to marry me, could I be, I won\'t say happy, but at peace,\r\nknowing that the other was here in prison, and would to-day or to-morrow\r\nhe taken to Siberia with a gang of other prisoners, while I accepted\r\ncongratulations and made calls with my young wife; or while I count the\r\nvotes at the meetings, for and against the motion brought forward by the\r\nrural inspection, etc., together with the Marechal de Noblesse, whom I\r\nabominably deceive, and afterwards make appointments with his wife\r\n(how abominable!) or while I continue to work at my picture, which will\r\ncertainly never get finished? Besides, I have no business to waste\r\ntime on such things. I can do nothing of the kind now," he continued\r\nto himself, rejoicing at the change he felt within himself. "The first\r\nthing now is to see the advocate and find out his decision, and then\r\n. . . then go and see her and tell her everything."\r\n\r\nAnd when he pictured to himself how he would see her, and tell her all,\r\nconfess his sin to her, and tell her that he would do all in his power\r\nto atone for his sin, he was touched at his own goodness, and the tears\r\ncame to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ABSURDITY OF LAW--REFLECTIONS OF A JURYMAN.\r\n\r\nOn coming into the Law Courts Nekhludoff met the usher of yesterday, who\r\nto-day seemed to him much to be pitied, in the corridor, and asked him\r\nwhere those prisoners who had been sentenced were kept, and to whom one\r\nhad to apply for permission to visit them. The usher told him that the\r\ncondemned prisoners were kept in different places, and that, until they\r\nreceived their sentence in its final form, the permission to visit them\r\ndepended on the president. "I\'ll come and call you myself, and take you\r\nto the president after the session. The president is not even here at\r\npresent. After the session! And now please come in; we are going to\r\ncommence."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thanked the usher for his kindness, and went into the\r\njurymen\'s room. As he was approaching the room, the other jurymen were\r\njust leaving it to go into the court. The merchant had again partaken\r\nof a little refreshment, and was as merry as the day before, and greeted\r\nNekhludoff like an old friend. And to-day Peter Gerasimovitch did not\r\narouse any unpleasant feelings in Nekhludoff by his familiarity and his\r\nloud laughter. Nekhludoff would have liked to tell all the jurymen about\r\nhis relations to yesterday\'s prisoner. "By rights," he thought, "I ought\r\nto have got up yesterday during the trial and disclosed my guilt."\r\n\r\nHe entered the court with the other jurymen, and witnessed the same\r\nprocedure as the day before.\r\n\r\n"The judges are coming," was again proclaimed, and again three men,\r\nwith embroidered collars, ascended the platform, and there was the same\r\nsettling of the jury on the high-backed chairs, the same gendarmes, the\r\nsame portraits, the same priest, and Nekhludoff felt that, though he\r\nknew what he ought to do, he could not interrupt all this solemnity.\r\nThe preparations for the trials were just the same as the day before,\r\nexcepting that the swearing in of the jury and the president\'s address\r\nto them were omitted.\r\n\r\nThe case before the Court this day was one of burglary. The prisoner,\r\nguarded by two gendarmes with naked swords, was a thin, narrow-chested\r\nlad of 20, with a bloodless, sallow face, dressed in a grey cloak.\r\nHe sat alone in the prisoner\'s dock. This boy was accused of having,\r\ntogether with a companion, broken the lock of a shed and stolen several\r\nold mats valued at 3 roubles [the rouble is worth a little over two\r\nshillings, and contains 100 copecks] and 67 copecks. According to the\r\nindictment, a policeman had stopped this boy as he was passing with his\r\ncompanion, who was carrying the mats on his shoulder. The boy and\r\nhis companion confessed at once, and were both imprisoned. The boy\'s\r\ncompanion, a locksmith, died in prison, and so the boy was being tried\r\nalone. The old mats were lying on the table as the objects of material\r\nevidence. The business was conducted just in the same manner as the day\r\nbefore, with the whole armoury of evidence, proofs, witnesses, swearing\r\nin, questions, experts, and cross-examinations. In answer to every\r\nquestion put to him by the president, the prosecutor, or the advocate,\r\nthe policeman (one of the witnesses) in variably ejected the words:\r\n"just so," or "Can\'t tell." Yet, in spite of his being stupefied, and\r\nrendered a mere machine by military discipline, his reluctance to speak\r\nabout the arrest of this prisoner was evident. Another witness, an old\r\nhouse proprietor, and owner of the mats, evidently a rich old man, when\r\nasked whether the mats were his, reluctantly identified them as such.\r\nWhen the public prosecutor asked him what he meant to do with these\r\nmats, what use they were to him, he got angry, and answered: "The devil\r\ntake those mats; I don\'t want them at all. Had I known there would be\r\nall this bother about them I should not have gone looking for them, but\r\nwould rather have added a ten-rouble note or two to them, only not to\r\nbe dragged here and pestered with questions. I have spent a lot\r\non isvostchiks. Besides, I am not well. I have been suffering from\r\nrheumatism for the last seven years." It was thus the witness spoke.\r\n\r\nThe accused himself confessed everything, and looking round stupidly,\r\nlike an animal that is caught, related how it had all happened. Still\r\nthe public prosecutor, drawing up his shoulders as he had done the day\r\nbefore, asked subtle questions calculated to catch a cunning criminal.\r\n\r\nIn his speech he proved that the theft had been committed from a\r\ndwelling-place, and a lock had been broken; and that the boy, therefore,\r\ndeserved a heavy punishment. The advocate appointed by the Court proved\r\nthat the theft was not committed from a dwelling-place, and that, though\r\nthe crime was a serious one, the prisoner was not so very dangerous\r\nto society as the prosecutor stated. The president assumed the role of\r\nabsolute neutrality in the same way as he had done on the previous day,\r\nand impressed on the jury facts which they all knew and could not help\r\nknowing. Then came an interval, just as the day before, and they smoked;\r\nand again the usher called out "The judges are coming," and in the\r\nsame way the two gendarmes sat trying to keep awake and threatening the\r\nprisoner with their naked weapons.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings showed that this boy was apprenticed by his father at\r\na tobacco factory, where he remained five years. This year he had been\r\ndischarged by the owner after a strike, and, having lost his place, he\r\nwandered about the town without any work, drinking all he possessed. In\r\na traktir [cheap restaurant] he met another like himself, who had lost\r\nhis place before the prisoner had, a locksmith by trade and a drunkard.\r\nOne night, those two, both drunk, broke the lock of a shed and took the\r\nfirst thing they happened to lay hands on. They confessed all and were\r\nput in prison, where the locksmith died while awaiting the trial. The\r\nboy was now being tried as a dangerous creature, from whom society must\r\nbe protected.\r\n\r\n"Just as dangerous a creature as yesterday\'s culprit," thought\r\nNekhludoff, listening to all that was going on before him. "They are\r\ndangerous, and we who judge them? I, a rake, an adulterer, a deceiver.\r\nWe are not dangerous. But, even supposing that this boy is the most\r\ndangerous of all that are here in the court, what should be done from a\r\ncommon-sense point of view when he has been caught? It is clear that he\r\nis not an exceptional evil-doer, but a most ordinary boy; every one\r\nsees it--and that he has become what he is simply because he got into\r\ncircumstances that create such characters, and, therefore, to prevent\r\nsuch a boy from going wrong the circumstances that create these\r\nunfortunate beings must be done away with.\r\n\r\n"But what do we do? We seize one such lad who happens to get caught,\r\nknowing well that there are thousands like him whom we have not caught,\r\nand send him to prison, where idleness, or most unwholesome, useless\r\nlabour is forced on him, in company of others weakened and ensnared by\r\nthe lives they have led. And then we send him, at the public expense,\r\nfrom the Moscow to the Irkoutsk Government, in company with the most\r\ndepraved of men.\r\n\r\n"But we do nothing to destroy the conditions in which people like these\r\nare produced; on the contrary, we support the establishments where\r\nthey are formed. These establishments are well known: factories, mills,\r\nworkshops, public-houses, gin-shops, brothels. And we do not destroy\r\nthese places, but, looking at them as necessary, we support and regulate\r\nthem. We educate in this way not one, but millions of people, and then\r\ncatch one of them and imagine that we have done something, that we have\r\nguarded ourselves, and nothing more can be expected of us. Have we\r\nnot sent him from the Moscow to the Irkoutsk Government?" Thus thought\r\nNekhludoff with unusual clearness and vividness, sitting in his\r\nhigh-backed chair next to the colonel, and listening to the different\r\nintonations of the advocates\', prosecutor\'s, and president\'s voices, and\r\nlooking at their self-confident gestures. "And how much and what hard\r\neffort this pretence requires," continued Nekhludoff in his mind,\r\nglancing round the enormous room, the portraits, lamps, armchairs,\r\nuniforms, the thick walls and large windows; and picturing to himself\r\nthe tremendous size of the building, and the still more ponderous\r\ndimensions of the whole of this organisation, with its army of\r\nofficials, scribes, watchmen, messengers, not only in this place, but\r\nall over Russia, who receive wages for carrying on this comedy which no\r\none needs. "Supposing we spent one-hundredth of these efforts helping\r\nthese castaways, whom we now only regard as hands and bodies, required\r\nby us for our own peace and comfort. Had some one chanced to take pity\r\non him and given some help at the time when poverty made them send him\r\nto town, it might have been sufficient," Nekhludoff thought, looking at\r\nthe boy\'s piteous face. "Or even later, when, after 12 hours\' work\r\nat the factory, he was going to the public-house, led away by his\r\ncompanions, had some one then come and said, \'Don\'t go, Vania; it is\r\nnot right,\' he would not have gone, nor got into bad ways, and would not\r\nhave done any wrong.\r\n\r\n"But no; no one who would have taken pity on him came across this\r\napprentice in the years he lived like a poor little animal in the town,\r\nand with his hair cut close so as not to breed vermin, and ran errands\r\nfor the workmen. No, all he heard and saw, from the older workmen and\r\nhis companions, since he came to live in town, was that he who cheats,\r\ndrinks, swears, who gives another a thrashing, who goes on the loose,\r\nis a fine fellow. Ill, his constitution undermined by unhealthy labour,\r\ndrink, and debauchery--bewildered as in a dream, knocking aimlessly\r\nabout town, he gets into some sort of a shed, and takes from there some\r\nold mats, which nobody needs--and here we, all of us educated people,\r\nrich or comfortably off, meet together, dressed in good clothes and fine\r\nuniforms, in a splendid apartment, to mock this unfortunate brother of\r\nours whom we ourselves have ruined.\r\n\r\n"Terrible! It is difficult to say whether the cruelty or the absurdity\r\nis greater, but the one and the other seem to reach their climax."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thought all this, no longer listening to what was going on,\r\nand he was horror-struck by that which was being revealed to him. He\r\ncould not understand why he had not been able to see all this before,\r\nand why others were unable to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE PROCUREUR--NEKHLUDOFF REFUSES TO SERVE.\r\n\r\nDuring an interval Nekhludoff got up and went out into the corridor,\r\nwith the intention of not returning to the court. Let them do what they\r\nliked with him, he could take no more part in this awful and horrid\r\ntomfoolery.\r\n\r\nHaving inquired where the Procureur\'s cabinet was he went straight to\r\nhim. The attendant did not wish to let him in, saying that the Procureur\r\nwas busy, but Nekhludoff paid no heed and went to the door, where he was\r\nmet by an official. He asked to be announced to the Procureur, saying he\r\nwas on the jury and had a very important communication to make.\r\n\r\nHis title and good clothes were of assistance to him. The official\r\nannounced him to the Procureur, and Nekhludoff was let in. The Procureur\r\nmet him standing, evidently annoyed at the persistence with which\r\nNekhludoff demanded admittance.\r\n\r\n"What is it you want?" the Procureur asked, severely.\r\n\r\n"I am on the jury; my name is Nekhludoff, and it is absolutely necessary\r\nfor me to see the prisoner Maslova," Nekhludoff said, quickly and\r\nresolutely, blushing, and feeling that he was taking a step which would\r\nhave a decisive influence on his life.\r\n\r\nThe Procureur was a short, dark man, with short, grizzly hair, quick,\r\nsparkling eyes, and a thick beard cut close on his projecting lower jaw.\r\n\r\n"Maslova? Yes, of course, I know. She was accused of poisoning," the\r\nProcureur said, quietly. "But why do you want to see her?" And then, as\r\nif wishing to tone down his question, he added, "I cannot give you the\r\npermission without knowing why you require it."\r\n\r\n"I require it for a particularly important reason."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said the Procureur, and, lifting his eyes, looked attentively at\r\nNekhludoff. "Has her case been heard or not?"\r\n\r\n"She was tried yesterday, and unjustly sentenced; she is innocent."\r\n\r\n"Yes? If she was sentenced only yesterday," went on the Procureur,\r\npaying no attention to Nekhludoff\'s statement concerning Maslova\'s\r\ninnocence, "she must still be in the preliminary detention prison until\r\nthe sentence is delivered in its final form. Visiting is allowed there\r\nonly on certain days; I should advise you to inquire there."\r\n\r\n"But I must see her as soon as possible," Nekhludoff said, his jaw\r\ntrembling as he felt the decisive moment approaching.\r\n\r\n"Why must you?" said the Procureur, lifting his brows with some\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n"Because I betrayed her and brought her to the condition which exposed\r\nher to this accusation."\r\n\r\n"All the same, I cannot see what it has to do with visiting her."\r\n\r\n"This: that whether I succeed or not in getting the sentence changed I\r\nwant to follow her, and--marry her," said Nekhludoff, touched to tears\r\nby his own conduct, and at the same time pleased to see the effect he\r\nproduced on the Procureur.\r\n\r\n"Really! Dear me!" said the Procureur. "This is certainly a very\r\nexceptional case. I believe you are a member of the Krasnoporsk rural\r\nadministration?" he asked, as if he remembered having heard before of\r\nthis Nekhludoff, who was now making so strange a declaration.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, but I do not think that has anything to do with my\r\nrequest," answered Nekhludoff, flushing angrily.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said the Procureur, with a scarcely perceptible smile\r\nand not in the least abashed; "only your wish is so extraordinary and so\r\nout of the common."\r\n\r\n"Well; but can I get the permission?"\r\n\r\n"The permission? Yes, I will give you an order of admittance directly.\r\nTake a seat."\r\n\r\nHe went up to the table, sat down, and began to write. "Please sit\r\ndown."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff continued to stand.\r\n\r\nHaving written an order of admittance, and handed it to Nekhludoff, the\r\nProcureur looked curiously at him.\r\n\r\n"I must also state that I can no longer take part in the sessions."\r\n\r\n"Then you will have to lay valid reasons before the Court, as you, of\r\ncourse, know."\r\n\r\n"My reasons are that I consider all judging not only useless, but\r\nimmoral."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the Procureur, with the same scarcely perceptible smile,\r\nas if to show that this kind of declaration was well known to him and\r\nbelonged to the amusing sort. "Yes, but you will certainly understand\r\nthat I as Procureur, can not agree with you on this point. Therefore,\r\nI should advise you to apply to the Court, which will consider your\r\ndeclaration, and find it valid or not valid, and in the latter case will\r\nimpose a fine. Apply, then, to the Court."\r\n\r\n"I have made my declaration, and shall apply nowhere else," Nekhludoff\r\nsaid, angrily.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, good-afternoon," said the Procureur, bowing his head,\r\nevidently anxious to be rid of this strange visitor.\r\n\r\n"Who was that you had here?" asked one of the members of the Court, as\r\nhe entered, just after Nekhludoff left the room.\r\n\r\n"Nekhludoff, you know; the same that used to make all sorts of strange\r\nstatements at the Krasnoporsk rural meetings. Just fancy! He is on the\r\njury, and among the prisoners there is a woman or girl sentenced to\r\npenal servitude, whom he says he betrayed, and now he wants to marry\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say so."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he told me. And in such a strange state of excitement!"\r\n\r\n"There is something abnormal in the young men of to-day."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but he is not so very young."\r\n\r\n"Yes. But how tiresome your famous Ivoshenka was. He carries the day by\r\nwearying one out. He talked and talked without end."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that kind of people should be simply stopped, or they will become\r\nreal obstructionists."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF ENDEAVOURS TO VISIT MASLOVA.\r\n\r\nFrom the Procureur Nekhludoff went straight to the preliminary detention\r\nprison. However, no Maslova was to be found there, and the inspector\r\nexplained to Nekhludoff that she would probably be in the old temporary\r\nprison. Nekhludoff went there.\r\n\r\nYes, Katerina Maslova was there.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the two prisons was enormous, and Nekhludoff only\r\nreached the old prison towards evening. He was going up to the door of\r\nthe large, gloomy building, but the sentinel stopped him and rang. A\r\nwarder came in answer to the bell. Nekhludoff showed him his order of\r\nadmittance, but the warder said he could not let him in without the\r\ninspector\'s permission. Nekhludoff went to see the inspector. As he was\r\ngoing up the stairs he heard distant sounds of some complicated bravura,\r\nplayed on the piano. When a cross servant girl, with a bandaged eye,\r\nopened the door to him, those sounds seemed to escape from the room\r\nand to strike his car. It was a rhapsody of Liszt\'s, that everybody was\r\ntired of, splendidly played but only to one point. When that point was\r\nreached the same thing was repeated. Nekhludoff asked the bandaged maid\r\nwhether the inspector was in. She answered that he was not in.\r\n\r\n"Will he return soon?"\r\n\r\nThe rhapsody again stopped and recommenced loudly and brilliantly again\r\nup to the same charmed point.\r\n\r\n"I will go and ask," and the servant went away.\r\n\r\n"Tell him he is not in and won\'t be to-day; he is out visiting. What do\r\nthey come bothering for?" came the sound of a woman\'s voice from behind\r\nthe door, and again the rhapsody rattled on and stopped, and the sound\r\nof a chair pushed back was heard. It was plain the irritated pianist\r\nmeant to rebuke the tiresome visitor, who had come at an untimely hour.\r\n"Papa is not in," a pale girl with crimped hair said, crossly, coming\r\nout into the ante-room, but, seeing a young man in a good coat, she\r\nsoftened.\r\n\r\n"Come in, please. . . . What is it you want?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see a prisoner in this prison."\r\n\r\n"A political one, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No, not a political one. I have a permission from the Procureur."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know, and papa is out; but come in, please," she said,\r\nagain, "or else speak to the assistant. He is in the office at present;\r\napply there. What is your name?"\r\n\r\n"I thank you," said Nekhludoff, without answering her question, and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe door was not yet closed after him when the same lively tones\r\nrecommenced. In the courtyard Nekhludoff met an officer with bristly\r\nmoustaches, and asked for the assistant-inspector. It was the assistant\r\nhimself. He looked at the order of admittance, but said that he could\r\nnot decide to let him in with a pass for the preliminary prison.\r\nBesides, it was too late. "Please to come again to-morrow. To morrow, at\r\n10, everybody is allowed to go in. Come then, and the inspector himself\r\nwill be at home. Then you can have the interview either in the common\r\nroom or, if the inspector allows it, in the office."\r\n\r\nAnd so Nekhludoff did not succeed in getting an interview that day,\r\nand returned home. As he went along the streets, excited at the idea of\r\nmeeting her, he no longer thought about the Law Courts, but recalled his\r\nconversations with the Procureur and the inspector\'s assistant. The\r\nfact that he had been seeking an interview with her, and had told the\r\nProcureur, and had been in two prisons, so excited him that it was long\r\nbefore he could calm down. When he got home he at once fetched out his\r\ndiary, that had long remained untouched, read a few sentences out of it,\r\nand then wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n"For two years I have not written anything in my diary, and thought I\r\nnever should return to this childishness. Yet it is not childishness,\r\nbut converse with my own self, with this real divine self which lives\r\nin every man. All this time that I slept there was no one for me to\r\nconverse with. I was awakened by an extraordinary event on the 28th\r\nof April, in the Law Court, when I was on the jury. I saw her in the\r\nprisoners\' dock, the Katusha betrayed by me, in a prisoner\'s cloak,\r\ncondemned to penal servitude through a strange mistake, and my own\r\nfault. I have just been to the Procureur\'s and to the prison, but I was\r\nnot admitted. I have resolved to do all I can to see her, to confess to\r\nher, and to atone for my sin, even by a marriage. God help me. My soul\r\nis at peace and I am full of joy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA RECALLS THE PAST.\r\n\r\nThat night Maslova lay awake a long time with her eyes open looking at\r\nthe door, in front of which the deacon\'s daughter kept passing. She was\r\nthinking that nothing would induce her to go to the island of Sakhalin\r\nand marry a convict, but would arrange matters somehow with one of the\r\nprison officials, the secretary, a warder, or even a warder\'s assistant.\r\n"Aren\'t they all given that way? Only I must not get thin, or else I am\r\nlost."\r\n\r\nShe thought of how the advocate had looked at her, and also the\r\npresident, and of the men she met, and those who came in on purpose at\r\nthe court. She recollected how her companion, Bertha, who came to see\r\nher in prison, had told her about the student whom she had "loved" while\r\nshe was with Kitaeva, and who had inquired about her, and pitied her\r\nvery much. She recalled many to mind, only not Nekhludoff. She never\r\nbrought back to mind the days of her childhood and youth, and her love\r\nto Nekhludoff. That would have been too painful. These memories lay\r\nuntouched somewhere deep in her soul; she had forgotten him, and never\r\nrecalled and never even dreamt of him. To-day, in the court, she did not\r\nrecognise him, not only because when she last saw him he was in uniform,\r\nwithout a beard, and had only a small moustache and thick, curly, though\r\nshort hair, and now was bald and bearded, but because she never thought\r\nabout him. She had buried his memory on that terrible dark night when\r\nhe, returning from the army, had passed by on the railway without\r\nstopping to call on his aunts. Katusha then knew her condition. Up to\r\nthat night she did not consider the child that lay beneath her heart\r\na burden. But on that night everything changed, and the child became\r\nnothing but a weight.\r\n\r\nHis aunts had expected Nekhludoff, had asked him to come and see them in\r\npassing, but he had telegraphed that he could not come, as he had to be\r\nin Petersburg at an appointed time. When Katusha heard this she made up\r\nher mind to go to the station and see him. The train was to pass by at\r\ntwo o\'clock in the night. Katusha having helped the old ladies to bed,\r\nand persuaded a little girl, the cook\'s daughter, Mashka, to come with\r\nher, put on a pair of old boots, threw a shawl over her head, gathered\r\nup her dress, and ran to the station.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm, rainy, and windy autumn night. The rain now pelted down\r\nin warm, heavy drops, now stopped again. It was too dark to see the path\r\nacross the field, and in the wood it was pitch black, so that although\r\nKatusha knew the way well, she got off the path, and got to the little\r\nstation where the train stopped for three minutes, not before, as she\r\nhad hoped, but after the second bell had been rung. Hurrying up the\r\nplatform, Katusha saw him at once at the windows of a first-class\r\ncarriage. Two officers sat opposite each other on the velvet-covered\r\nseats, playing cards. This carriage was very brightly lit up; on the\r\nlittle table between the seats stood two thick, dripping candles. He sat\r\nin his closefitting breeches on the arm of the seat, leaning against\r\nthe back, and laughed. As soon as she recognised him she knocked at the\r\ncarriage window with her benumbed hand, but at that moment the last bell\r\nrang, and the train first gave a backward jerk, and then gradually the\r\ncarriages began to move forward. One of the players rose with the cards\r\nin his hand, and looked out. She knocked again, and pressed her face to\r\nthe window, but the carriage moved on, and she went alongside looking\r\nin. The officer tried to lower the window, but could not. Nekhludoff\r\npushed him aside and began lowering it himself. The train went faster,\r\nso that she had to walk quickly. The train went on still faster and the\r\nwindow opened. The guard pushed her aside, and jumped in. Katusha ran\r\non, along the wet boards of the platform, and when she came to the end\r\nshe could hardly stop herself from falling as she ran down the steps\r\nof the platform. She was running by the side of the railway, though the\r\nfirst-class carriage had long passed her, and the second-class carriages\r\nwere gliding by faster, and at last the third-class carriages still\r\nfaster. But she ran on, and when the last carriage with the lamps at\r\nthe back had gone by, she had already reached the tank which fed the\r\nengines, and was unsheltered from the wind, which was blowing her shawl\r\nabout and making her skirt cling round her legs. The shawl flew off her\r\nhead, but still she ran on.\r\n\r\n"Katerina Michaelovna, you\'ve lost your shawl!" screamed the little\r\ngirl, who was trying to keep up with her.\r\n\r\nKatusha stopped, threw back her head, and catching hold of it with both\r\nhands sobbed aloud. "Gone!" she screamed.\r\n\r\n"He is sitting in a velvet arm-chair and joking and drinking, in a\r\nbrightly lit carriage, and I, out here in the mud, in the darkness, in\r\nthe wind and the rain, am standing and weeping," she thought to herself;\r\nand sat down on the ground, sobbing so loud that the little girl got\r\nfrightened, and put her arms round her, wet as she was.\r\n\r\n"Come home, dear," she said.\r\n\r\n"When a train passes--then under a carriage, and there will be an end,"\r\nKatusha was thinking, without heeding the girl.\r\n\r\nAnd she made up her mind to do it, when, as it always happens, when a\r\nmoment of quiet follows great excitement, he, the child--his child--made\r\nhimself known within her. Suddenly all that a moment before had been\r\ntormenting her, so that it had seemed impossible to live, all her\r\nbitterness towards him, and the wish to revenge herself, even by dying,\r\npassed away; she grew quieter, got up, put the shawl on her head, and\r\nwent home.\r\n\r\nWet, muddy, and quite exhausted, she returned, and from that day the\r\nchange which brought her where she now was began to operate in her soul.\r\nBeginning from that dreadful night, she ceased believing in God and\r\nin goodness. She had herself believed in God, and believed that other\r\npeople also believed in Him; but after that night she became convinced\r\nthat no one believed, and that all that was said about God and His\r\nlaws was deception and untruth. He whom she loved, and who had loved\r\nher--yes, she knew that--had thrown her away; had abused her love. Yet\r\nhe was the best of all the people she knew. All the rest were still\r\nworse. All that afterwards happened to her strengthened her in this\r\nbelief at every step. His aunts, the pious old ladies, turned her out\r\nwhen she could no longer serve them as she used to. And of all those she\r\nmet, the women used her as a means of getting money, the men, from the\r\nold police officer down to the warders of the prison, looked at her as\r\non an object for pleasure. And no one in the world cared for aught but\r\npleasure. In this belief the old author with whom she had come together\r\nin the second year of her life of independence had strengthened her. He\r\nhad told her outright that it was this that constituted the happiness of\r\nlife, and he called it poetical and aesthetic.\r\n\r\nEverybody lived for himself only, for his pleasure, and all the talk\r\nconcerning God and righteousness was deception. And if sometimes doubts\r\narose in her mind and she wondered why everything was so ill-arranged\r\nin the world that all hurt each other, and made each other suffer, she\r\nthought it best not to dwell on it, and if she felt melancholy she could\r\nsmoke, or, better still, drink, and it would pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY IN PRISON--PREPARING FOR MASS.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning at five o\'clock, when a whistle sounded in the\r\ncorridor of the women\'s ward of the prison, Korableva, who was already\r\nawake, called Maslova.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! life again," thought Maslova, with horror, involuntarily\r\nbreathing in the air that had become terribly noisome towards the\r\nmorning. She wished to fall asleep again, to enter into the region of\r\noblivion, but the habit of fear overcame sleepiness, and she sat up and\r\nlooked round, drawing her feet under her. The women had all got up; only\r\nthe elder children were still asleep. The spirit-trader was carefully\r\ndrawing a cloak from under the children, so as not to wake them. The\r\nwatchman\'s wife was hanging up the rags to dry that served the baby\r\nas swaddling clothes, while the baby was screaming desperately in\r\nTheodosia\'s arms, who was trying to quiet it. The consumptive woman was\r\ncoughing with her hands pressed to her chest, while the blood rushed to\r\nher face, and she sighed loudly, almost screaming, in the intervals of\r\ncoughing. The fat, red-haired woman was lying on her back, with\r\nknees drawn up, and loudly relating a dream. The old woman accused of\r\nincendiarism was standing in front of the image, crossing herself and\r\nbowing, and repeating the same words over and over again. The deacon\'s\r\ndaughter sat on the bedstead, looking before her, with a dull, sleepy\r\nface. Khoroshavka was twisting her black, oily, coarse hair round her\r\nfingers. The sound of slipshod feet was heard in the passage, and the\r\ndoor opened to let in two convicts, dressed in jackets and grey trousers\r\nthat did not reach to their ankles. With serious, cross faces they\r\nlifted the stinking tub and carried it out of the cell. The women went\r\nout to the taps in the corridor to wash. There the red-haired woman\r\nagain began a quarrel with a woman from another cell.\r\n\r\n"Is it the solitary cell you want?" shouted an old jailer, slapping the\r\nred-haired woman on her bare, fat back, so that it sounded through the\r\ncorridor. "You be quiet."\r\n\r\n"Lawks! the old one\'s playful," said the woman, taking his action for a\r\ncaress.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, be quick; get ready for the mass." Maslova had hardly time\r\nto do her hair and dress when the inspector came with his assistants.\r\n\r\n"Come out for inspection," cried a jailer.\r\n\r\nSome more prisoners came out of other cells and stood in two rows along\r\nthe corridor; each woman had to place her hand on the shoulder of the\r\nwoman in front of her. They were all counted.\r\n\r\nAfter the inspection the woman warder led the prisoners to church.\r\nMaslova and Theodosia were in the middle of a column of over a hundred\r\nwomen, who had come out of different cells. All were dressed in white\r\nskirts, white jackets, and wore white kerchiefs on their heads, except\r\na few who had their own coloured clothes on. These were wives who, with\r\ntheir children, were following their convict husbands to Siberia. The\r\nwhole flight of stairs was filled by the procession. The patter of\r\nsoftly-shod feet mingled with the voices and now and then a laugh. When\r\nturning, on the landing, Maslova saw her enemy, Botchkova, in front, and\r\npointed out her angry face to Theodosia. At the bottom of the stairs the\r\nwomen stopped talking. Bowing and crossing themselves, they entered the\r\nempty church, which glistened with gilding. Crowding and pushing one\r\nanother, they took their places on the right.\r\n\r\nAfter the women came the men condemned to banishment, those serving\r\ntheir term in the prison, and those exiled by their Communes; and,\r\ncoughing loudly, they took their stand, crowding the left side and the\r\nmiddle of the church.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the gallery above stood the men sentenced to penal\r\nservitude in Siberia, who had been let into the church before the\r\nothers. Each of them had half his head shaved, and their presence was\r\nindicated by the clanking of the chains on their feet. On the other side\r\nof the gallery stood those in preliminary confinement, without chains,\r\ntheir heads not shaved.\r\n\r\nThe prison church had been rebuilt and ornamented by a rich merchant,\r\nwho spent several tens of thousands of roubles on it, and it glittered\r\nwith gay colours and gold. For a time there was silence in the church,\r\nand only coughing, blowing of noses, the crying of babies, and now and\r\nthen the rattling of chains, was heard. But at last the convicts that\r\nstood in the middle moved, pressed against each other, leaving a passage\r\nin the centre of the church, down which the prison inspector passed to\r\ntake his place in front of every one in the nave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISON CHURCH--BLIND LEADERS OF THE BLIND.\r\n\r\nThe service began.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of the following. The priest, having dressed in a strange\r\nand very inconvenient garb, made of gold cloth, cut and arranged little\r\nbits of bread on a saucer, and then put them into a cup with wine,\r\nrepeating at the same time different names and prayers. Meanwhile\r\nthe deacon first read Slavonic prayers, difficult to understand in\r\nthemselves, and rendered still more incomprehensible by being read very\r\nfast, and then sang them turn and turn about with the convicts. The\r\ncontents of the prayers were chiefly the desire for the welfare of\r\nthe Emperor and his family. These petitions were repeated many times,\r\nseparately and together with other prayers, the people kneeling. Besides\r\nthis, several verses from the Acts of the Apostles were read by the\r\ndeacon in a peculiarly strained voice, which made it impossible to\r\nunderstand what he read, and then the priest read very distinctly a\r\npart of the Gospel according to St. Mark, in which it said that Christ,\r\nhaving risen from the dead before flying up to heaven to sit down at His\r\nFather\'s right hand, first showed Himself to Mary Magdalene, out of whom\r\nHe had driven seven devils, and then to eleven of His disciples, and\r\nordered them to preach the Gospel to the whole creation, and the priest\r\nadded that if any one did not believe this he would perish, but he that\r\nbelieved it and was baptised should be saved, and should besides drive\r\nout devils and cure people by laying his hands on them, should talk in\r\nstrange tongues, should take up serpents, and if he drank poison should\r\nnot die, but remain well.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the service consisted in the supposition that the bits\r\ncut up by the priest and put by him into the wine, when manipulated and\r\nprayed over in a certain way, turned into the flesh and blood of God.\r\n\r\nThese manipulations consisted in the priest\'s regularly lifting and\r\nholding up his arms, though hampered by the gold cloth sack he had on,\r\nthen, sinking on to his knees and kissing the table and all that was on\r\nit, but chiefly in his taking a cloth by two of its corners and waving\r\nit regularly and softly over the silver saucer and golden cup. It was\r\nsupposed that, at this point, the bread and the wine turned into flesh\r\nand blood; therefore, this part of the service was performed with the\r\ngreatest solemnity.\r\n\r\n"Now, to the blessed, most pure, and most holy Mother of God," the\r\npriest cried from the golden partition which divided part of the church\r\nfrom the rest, and the choir began solemnly to sing that it was very\r\nright to glorify the Virgin Mary, who had borne Christ without losing\r\nher virginity, and was therefore worthy of greater honour than some kind\r\nof cherubim, and greater glory than some kind of seraphim. After this\r\nthe transformation was considered accomplished, and the priest having\r\ntaken the napkin off the saucer, cut the middle bit of bread in four,\r\nand put it into the wine, and then into his mouth. He was supposed to\r\nhave eaten a bit of God\'s flesh and swallowed a little of His blood.\r\nThen the priest drew a curtain, opened the middle door in the partition,\r\nand, taking the gold cup in his hands, came out of the door, inviting\r\nthose who wished to do so also to come and eat some of God\'s flesh and\r\nblood that was contained in the cup. A few children appeared to wish to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nAfter having asked the children their names, the priest carefully took\r\nout of the cup, with a spoon, and shoved a bit of bread soaked in wine\r\ndeep into the mouth of each child in turn, and the deacon, while wiping\r\nthe children\'s mouths, sang, in a merry voice, that the children were\r\neating the flesh and drinking the blood of God. After this the priest\r\ncarried the cup back behind the partition, and there drank all the\r\nremaining blood and ate up all the bits of flesh, and after having\r\ncarefully sucked his moustaches and wiped his mouth, he stepped briskly\r\nfrom behind the partition, the soles of his calfskin boots creaking.\r\nThe principal part of this Christian service was now finished, but\r\nthe priest, wishing to comfort the unfortunate prisoners, added to the\r\nordinary service another. This consisted of his going up to the gilt\r\nhammered-out image (with black face and hands) supposed to represent\r\nthe very God he had been eating, illuminated by a dozen wax candles, and\r\nproceeding, in a strange, discordant voice, to hum or sing the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n"Jesu sweetest, glorified of the Apostles, Jesu lauded by the martyrs,\r\nalmighty Monarch, save me, Jesu my Saviour. Jesu, most beautiful, have\r\nmercy on him who cries to Thee, Saviour Jesu. Born of prayer Jesu, all\r\nthy saints, all thy prophets, save and find them worthy of the joys of\r\nheaven. Jesu, lover of men."\r\n\r\nThen he stopped, drew breath, crossed himself, bowed to the ground, and\r\nevery one did the same--the inspector, the warders, the prisoners; and\r\nfrom above the clinking of the chains sounded more unintermittently.\r\nThen he continued: "Of angels the Creator and Lord of powers, Jesu most\r\nwonderful, the angels\' amazement, Jesu most powerful, of our forefathers\r\nthe Redeemer. Jesu sweetest, of patriarchs the praise. Jesu most\r\nglorious, of kings the strength. Jesu most good, of prophets the\r\nfulfilment. Jesu most amazing, of martyrs the strength. Jesu most\r\nhumble, of monks the joy. Jesu most merciful, of priests the sweetness.\r\nJesu most charitable, of the fasting the continence. Jesu most sweet,\r\nof the just the joy. Jesu most pure, of the celibates the chastity. Jesu\r\nbefore all ages of sinners the salvation. Jesu, son of God, have mercy\r\non me."\r\n\r\nEvery time he repeated the word "Jesu" his voice became more and\r\nmore wheezy. At last he came to a stop, and holding up his silk-lined\r\ncassock, and kneeling down on one knee, he stooped down to the ground\r\nand the choir began to sing, repeating the words, "Jesu, Son of God,\r\nhave mercy on me," and the convicts fell down and rose again, shaking\r\nback the hair that was left on their heads, and rattling with the chains\r\nthat were bruising their thin ankles.\r\n\r\nThis continued for a long time. First came the glorification, which\r\nended with the words, "Have mercy on me." Then more glorifications,\r\nending with "Alleluia!" And the convicts made the sign of the cross,\r\nand bowed, first at each sentence, then after every two and then after\r\nthree, and all were very glad when the glorification ended, and the\r\npriest shut the book with a sigh of relief and retired behind the\r\npartition. One last act remained. The priest took a large, gilt cross,\r\nwith enamel medallions at the ends, from a table, and came out into the\r\ncentre of the church with it. First the inspector came up and kissed\r\nthe cross, then the jailers, then the convicts, pushing and abusing\r\neach other in whispers. The priest, talking to the inspector, pushed the\r\ncross and his hand now against the mouths and now against the noses of\r\nthe convicts, who were trying to kiss both the cross and the hand of the\r\npriest. And thus ended the Christian service, intended for the comfort\r\nand the teaching of these strayed brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE HUSKS OF RELIGION.\r\n\r\nAnd none of those present, from the inspector down to Maslova, seemed\r\nconscious of the fact that this Jesus, whose name the priest repeated\r\nsuch a great number of times, and whom he praised with all these curious\r\nexpressions, had forbidden the very things that were being done there;\r\nthat He had prohibited not only this meaningless much-speaking and the\r\nblasphemous incantation over the bread and wine, but had also, in the\r\nclearest words, forbidden men to call other men their master, and to\r\npray in temples; and had ordered that every one should pray in solitude,\r\nhad forbidden to erect temples, saying that He had come to destroy\r\nthem, and that one should worship, not in a temple, but in spirit and\r\nin truth; and, above all, that He had forbidden not only to judge, to\r\nimprison, to torment, to execute men, as was being done here, but had\r\nprohibited any kind of violence, saying that He had come to give freedom\r\nto the captives.\r\n\r\nNo one present seemed conscious that all that was going on here was the\r\ngreatest blasphemy and a supreme mockery of that same Christ in whose\r\nname it was being done. No one seemed to realise that the gilt cross\r\nwith the enamel medallions at the ends, which the priest held out to the\r\npeople to be kissed, was nothing but the emblem of that gallows on which\r\nChrist had been executed for denouncing just what was going on here.\r\nThat these priests, who imagined they were eating and drinking the body\r\nand blood of Christ in the form of bread and wine, did in reality eat\r\nand drink His flesh and His blood, but not as wine and bits of bread,\r\nbut by ensnaring "these little ones" with whom He identified Himself,\r\nby depriving them of the greatest blessings and submitting them to most\r\ncruel torments, and by hiding from men the tidings of great joy which\r\nHe had brought. That thought did not enter into the mind of any one\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe priest did his part with a quiet conscience, because he was brought\r\nup from childhood to consider that the only true faith was the faith\r\nwhich had been held by all the holy men of olden times and was still\r\nheld by the Church, and demanded by the State authorities. He did not\r\nbelieve that the bread turned into flesh, that it was useful for the\r\nsoul to repeat so many words, or that he had actually swallowed a bit of\r\nGod. No one could believe this, but he believed that one ought to hold\r\nthis faith. What strengthened him most in this faith was the fact that,\r\nfor fulfilling the demands of this faith, he had for the last 15 years\r\nbeen able to draw an income, which enabled him to keep his family, send\r\nhis son to a gymnasium and his daughter to a school for the daughters of\r\nthe clergy. The deacon believed in the same manner, and even more firmly\r\nthan the priest, for he had forgotten the substance of the dogmas of\r\nthis faith, and knew only that the prayers for the dead, the masses,\r\nwith and without the acathistus, all had a definite price, which real\r\nChristians readily paid, and, therefore, he called out his "have mercy,\r\nhave mercy," very willingly, and read and said what was appointed, with\r\nthe same quiet certainty of its being necessary to do so with which\r\nother men sell faggots, flour, or potatoes. The prison inspector and the\r\nwarders, though they had never understood or gone into the meaning of\r\nthese dogmas and of all that went on in church, believed that they must\r\nbelieve, because the higher authorities and the Tsar himself believed in\r\nit. Besides, though faintly (and themselves unable to explain why), they\r\nfelt that this faith defended their cruel occupations. If this faith\r\ndid not exist it would have been more difficult, perhaps impossible, for\r\nthem to use all their powers to torment people, as they were now doing,\r\nwith a quiet conscience. The inspector was such a kind-hearted man that\r\nhe could not have lived as he was now living unsupported by his faith.\r\nTherefore, he stood motionless, bowed and crossed himself zealously,\r\ntried to feel touched when the song about the cherubims was being sung,\r\nand when the children received communion he lifted one of them, and held\r\nhim up to the priest with his own hands.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the prisoners believed that there lay a mystic\r\npower in these gilt images, these vestments, candles, cups, crosses,\r\nand this repetition of incomprehensible words, "Jesu sweetest" and "have\r\nmercy"--a power through which might be obtained much convenience in this\r\nand in the future life. Only a few clearly saw the deception that was\r\npractised on the people who adhered to this faith, and laughed at it in\r\ntheir hearts; but the majority, having made several attempts to get the\r\nconveniences they desired, by means of prayers, masses, and candles, and\r\nnot having got them (their prayers remaining unanswered), were each of\r\nthem convinced that their want of success was accidental, and that\r\nthis organisation, approved by the educated and by archbishops, is very\r\nimportant and necessary, if not for this, at any rate for the next life.\r\n\r\nMaslova also believed in this way. She felt, like the rest, a mixed\r\nsensation of piety and dulness. She stood at first in a crowd behind a\r\nrailing, so that she could see no one but her companions; but when those\r\nto receive communion moved on, she and Theodosia stepped to the front,\r\nand they saw the inspector, and, behind him, standing among the warders,\r\na little peasant, with a very light beard and fair hair. This was\r\nTheodosia\'s husband, and he was gazing with fixed eyes at his wife.\r\nDuring the acathistus Maslova occupied herself in scrutinising him and\r\ntalking to Theodosia in whispers, and bowed and made the sign of the\r\ncross only when every one else did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nVISITING DAY--THE MEN\'S WARD.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff left home early. A peasant from the country was still driving\r\nalong the side street and calling out in a voice peculiar to his trade,\r\n"Milk! milk! milk!"\r\n\r\nThe first warm spring rain had fallen the day before, and now wherever\r\nthe ground was not paved the grass shone green. The birch trees in the\r\ngardens looked as if they were strewn with green fluff, the wild cherry\r\nand the poplars unrolled their long, balmy buds, and in shops and\r\ndwelling-houses the double window-frames were being removed and the\r\nwindows cleaned.\r\n\r\nIn the Tolkoochi [literally, jostling market, where second-hand clothes\r\nand all sorts of cheap goods are sold] market, which Nekhludoff had to\r\npass on his way, a dense crowd was surging along the row of booths, and\r\ntattered men walked about selling top-boots, which they carried under\r\ntheir arms, and renovated trousers and waistcoats, which hung over their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nMen in clean coats and shining boots, liberated from the factories, it\r\nbeing Sunday, and women with bright silk kerchiefs on their heads and\r\ncloth jackets trimmed with jet, were already thronging at the door of\r\nthe traktir. Policemen, with yellow cords to their uniforms and carrying\r\npistols, were on duty, looking out for some disorder which might\r\ndistract the ennui that oppressed them. On the paths of the boulevards\r\nand on the newly-revived grass, children and dogs ran about, playing,\r\nand the nurses sat merrily chattering on the benches. Along the streets,\r\nstill fresh and damp on the shady side, but dry in the middle, heavy\r\ncarts rumbled unceasingly, cabs rattled and tramcars passed ringing by.\r\nThe air vibrated with the pealing and clanging of church bells, that\r\nwere calling the people to attend to a service like that which was now\r\nbeing conducted in the prison. And the people, dressed in their Sunday\r\nbest, were passing on their way to their different parish churches.\r\n\r\nThe isvostchik did not drive Nekhludoff up to the prison itself, but to\r\nthe last turning that led to the prison.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons--men and women--most of them carrying small bundles,\r\nstood at this turning, about 100 steps from the prison. To the right\r\nthere were several low wooden buildings; to the left, a two-storeyed\r\nhouse with a signboard. The huge brick building, the prison proper, was\r\njust in front, and the visitors were not allowed to come up to it. A\r\nsentinel was pacing up and down in front of it, and shouted at any one\r\nwho tried to pass him.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the wooden buildings, to the right, opposite the\r\nsentinel, sat a warder on a bench, dressed in uniform, with gold cords,\r\na notebook in his hands. The visitors came up to him, and named the\r\npersons they wanted to see, and he put the names down. Nekhludoff also\r\nwent up, and named Katerina Maslova. The warder wrote down the name.\r\n\r\n"Why--don\'t they admit us yet?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"The service is going on. When the mass is over, you\'ll be admitted."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stepped aside from the waiting crowd. A man in tattered\r\nclothes, crumpled hat, with bare feet and red stripes all over his face,\r\ndetached himself from the crowd, and turned towards the prison.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, where are you going?" shouted the sentinel with the gun.\r\n\r\n"And you hold your row," answered the tramp, not in the least abashed by\r\nthe sentinel\'s words, and turned back. "Well, if you\'ll not let me in,\r\nI\'ll wait. But, no! Must needs shout, as if he were a general."\r\n\r\nThe crowd laughed approvingly. The visitors were, for the greater\r\npart, badly-dressed people; some were ragged, but there were also\r\nsome respectable-looking men and women. Next to Nekhludoff stood a\r\nclean-shaven, stout, and red-cheeked man, holding a bundle, apparently\r\ncontaining under-garments. This was the doorkeeper of a bank; he had\r\ncome to see his brother, who was arrested for forgery. The good-natured\r\nfellow told Nekhludoff the whole story of his life, and was going to\r\nquestion him in turn, when their attention was aroused by a student and\r\na veiled lady, who drove up in a trap, with rubber tyres, drawn by a\r\nlarge thoroughbred horse. The student was holding a large bundle. He\r\ncame up to Nekhludoff, and asked if and how he could give the rolls he\r\nhad brought in alms to the prisoners. His fiancee wished it (this lady\r\nwas his fiancee), and her parents had advised them to take some rolls to\r\nthe prisoners.\r\n\r\n"I myself am here for the first time," said Nekhludoff, "and don\'t know;\r\nbut I think you had better ask this man," and he pointed to the warder\r\nwith the gold cords and the book, sitting on the right.\r\n\r\nAs they were speaking, the large iron door with a window in it opened,\r\nand an officer in uniform, followed by another warder, stepped out.\r\nThe warder with the notebook proclaimed that the admittance of visitors\r\nwould now commence. The sentinel stepped aside, and all the visitors\r\nrushed to the door as if afraid of being too late; some even ran. At\r\nthe door there stood a warder who counted the visitors as they came\r\nin, saying aloud, 16, 17, and so on. Another warder stood inside the\r\nbuilding and also counted the visitors as they entered a second door,\r\ntouching each one with his hand, so that when they went away again\r\nnot one visitor should be able to remain inside the prison and not\r\none prisoner might get out. The warder, without looking at whom he was\r\ntouching, slapped Nekhludoff on the back, and Nekhludoff felt hurt by\r\nthe touch of the warder\'s hand; but, remembering what he had come about,\r\nhe felt ashamed of feeling dissatisfied and taking offence.\r\n\r\nThe first apartment behind the entrance doors was a large vaulted room\r\nwith iron bars to the small windows. In this room, which was called the\r\nmeeting-room, Nekhludoff was startled by the sight of a large picture of\r\nthe Crucifixion.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that for?" he thought, his mind involuntarily connecting the\r\nsubject of the picture with liberation and not with imprisonment.\r\n\r\nHe went on, slowly letting the hurrying visitors pass before, and\r\nexperiencing a mingled feeling of horror at the evil-doers locked up in\r\nthis building, compassion for those who, like Katusha and the boy they\r\ntried the day before, must be here though guiltless, and shyness and\r\ntender emotion at the thought of the interview before him. The warder\r\nat the other end of the meeting-room said something as they passed, but\r\nNekhludoff, absorbed by his own thoughts, paid no attention to him, and\r\ncontinued to follow the majority of the visitors, and so got into the\r\nmen\'s part of the prison instead of the women\'s.\r\n\r\nLetting the hurrying visitors pass before him, he was the last to get\r\ninto the interviewing-room. As soon as Nekhludoff opened the door of\r\nthis room, he was struck by the deafening roar of a hundred voices\r\nshouting at once, the reason of which he did not at once understand. But\r\nwhen he came nearer to the people, he saw that they were all pressing\r\nagainst a net that divided the room in two, like flies settling on\r\nsugar, and he understood what it meant. The two halves of the room,\r\nthe windows of which were opposite the door he had come in by, were\r\nseparated, not by one, but by two nets reaching from the floor to the\r\nceiling. The wire nets were stretched 7 feet apart, and soldiers were\r\nwalking up and down the space between them. On the further side of the\r\nnets were the prisoners, on the nearer, the visitors. Between them was\r\na double row of nets and a space of 7 feet wide, so that they could not\r\nhand anything to one another, and any one whose sight was not very\r\ngood could not even distinguish the face on the other side. It was also\r\ndifficult to talk; one had to scream in order to be heard.\r\n\r\nOn both sides were faces pressed close to the nets, faces of wives,\r\nhusbands, fathers, mothers, children, trying to see each other\'s\r\nfeatures and to say what was necessary in such a way as to be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nBut as each one tried to be heard by the one he was talking to, and\r\nhis neighbour tried to do the same, they did their best to drown each\r\nother\'s voices\' and that was the cause of the din and shouting which\r\nstruck Nekhludoff when he first came in. It was impossible to understand\r\nwhat was being said and what were the relations between the different\r\npeople. Next Nekhludoff an old woman with a kerchief on her head stood\r\ntrembling, her chin pressed close to the net, and shouting something to\r\na young fellow, half of whose head was shaved, who listened attentively\r\nwith raised brows. By the side of the old woman was a young man in\r\na peasant\'s coat, who listened, shaking his head, to a boy very like\r\nhimself. Next stood a man in rags, who shouted, waving his arm and\r\nlaughing. Next to him a woman, with a good woollen shawl on her\r\nshoulders, sat on the floor holding a baby in her lap and crying\r\nbitterly. This was apparently the first time she saw the greyheaded man\r\non the other side in prison clothes, and with his head shaved. Beyond\r\nher was the doorkeeper, who had spoken to Nekhludoff outside; he was\r\nshouting with all his might to a greyhaired convict on the other side.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff found that he would have to speak in similar conditions,\r\na feeling of indignation against those who were able to make and enforce\r\nthese conditions arose in him; he was surprised that, placed in such\r\na dreadful position, no one seemed offended at this outrage on human\r\nfeelings. The soldiers, the inspector, the prisoners themselves, acted\r\nas if acknowledging all this to be necessary.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff remained in this room for about five minutes, feeling\r\nstrangely depressed, conscious of how powerless he was, and at variance\r\nwith all the world. He was seized with a curious moral sensation like\r\nseasickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nVISITING DAY--THE WOMEN\'S WARD.\r\n\r\n"Well, but I must do what I came here for," he said, trying to pick up\r\ncourage. "What is to be done now?" He looked round for an official, and\r\nseeing a thin little man in the uniform of an officer going up and down\r\nbehind the people, he approached him.\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me, sir," he said, with exceedingly strained politeness of\r\nmanner, "where the women are kept, and where one is allowed to interview\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"Is it the women\'s ward you want to go to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I should like to see one of the women prisoners," Nekhludoff said,\r\nwith the same strained politeness.\r\n\r\n"You should have said so when you were in the hall. Who is it, then,\r\nthat you want to see?"\r\n\r\n"I want to see a prisoner called Katerina Maslova."\r\n\r\n"Is she a political one?"\r\n\r\n"No, she is simply . . ."\r\n\r\n"What! Is she sentenced?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the day before yesterday she was sentenced," meekly answered\r\nNekhludoff, fearing to spoil the inspector\'s good humour, which seemed\r\nto incline in his favour.\r\n\r\n"If you want to go to the women\'s ward please to step this way," said\r\nthe officer, having decided from Nekhludoff\'s appearance that he was\r\nworthy of attention. "Sideroff, conduct the gentleman to the women\'s\r\nward," he said, turning to a moustached corporal with medals on his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nAt this moment heart-rending sobs were heard coming from some one near\r\nthe net.\r\n\r\nEverything here seemed strange to Nekhludoff; but strangest of all was\r\nthat he should have to thank and feel obligation towards the inspector\r\nand the chief warders, the very men who were performing the cruel deeds\r\nthat were done in this house.\r\n\r\nThe corporal showed Nekhludoff through the corridor, out of the men\'s\r\ninto the women\'s interviewing-room.\r\n\r\nThis room, like that of the men, was divided by two wire nets; but it\r\nwas much smaller, and there were fewer visitors and fewer prisoners, so\r\nthat there was less shouting than in the men\'s room. Yet the same thing\r\nwas going on here, only, between the nets instead of soldiers there was\r\na woman warder, dressed in a blue-edged uniform jacket, with gold cords\r\non the sleeves, and a blue belt. Here also, as in the men\'s room, the\r\npeople were pressing close to the wire netting on both sides; on the\r\nnearer side, the townspeople in varied attire; on the further side, the\r\nprisoners, some in white prison clothes, others in their own coloured\r\ndresses. The whole length of the net was taken up by the people standing\r\nclose to it. Some rose on tiptoe to be heard across the heads of others;\r\nsome sat talking on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the prisoners, both by her piercing screams and\r\nher appearance, was a thin, dishevelled gipsy. Her kerchief had slipped\r\noff her curly hair, and she stood near a post in the middle of the\r\nprisoner\'s division, shouting something, accompanied by quick gestures,\r\nto a gipsy man in a blue coat, girdled tightly below the waist. Next\r\nthe gipsy man, a soldier sat on the ground talking to prisoner; next the\r\nsoldier, leaning close to the net, stood a young peasant, with a fair\r\nbeard and a flushed face, keeping back his tears with difficulty. A\r\npretty, fair-haired prisoner, with bright blue eyes, was speaking to\r\nhim. These two were Theodosia and her husband. Next to them was a tramp,\r\ntalking to a broad-faced woman; then two women, then a man, then again a\r\nwoman, and in front of each a prisoner. Maslova was not among them. But\r\nsome one stood by the window behind the prisoners, and Nekhludoff knew\r\nit was she. His heart began to beat faster, and his breath stopped. The\r\ndecisive moment was approaching. He went up to the part of the net where\r\nhe could see the prisoner, and recognised her at once. She stood behind\r\nthe blue-eyed Theodosia, and smiled, listening to what Theodosia was\r\nsaying. She did not wear the prison cloak now, but a white dress,\r\ntightly drawn in at the waist by a belt, and very full in the bosom.\r\nFrom under her kerchief appeared the black ringlets of her fringe, just\r\nthe same as in the court.\r\n\r\n"Now, in a moment it will be decided," he thought.\r\n\r\n"How shall I call her? Or will she come herself?"\r\n\r\nShe was expecting Bertha; that this man had come to see her never\r\nentered her head.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you want?" said the warder who was walking between the nets,\r\ncoming up to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Katerina Maslova," Nekhludoff uttered, with difficulty.\r\n\r\n"Katerina Maslova, some one to see you," cried the warder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF VISITS MASLOVA.\r\n\r\nMaslova looked round, and with head thrown back and expanded chest,\r\ncame up to the net with that expression of readiness which he well\r\nknew, pushed in between two prisoners, and gazed at Nekhludoff with a\r\nsurprised and questioning look. But, concluding from his clothing he was\r\na rich man, she smiled.\r\n\r\n"Is it me you want?" she asked, bringing her smiling face, with the\r\nslightly squinting eyes, nearer the net.\r\n\r\n"I, I--I wished to see--" Nekhludoff did not know how to address her. "I\r\nwished to see you--I--" He was not speaking louder than usual.\r\n\r\n"No; nonsense, I tell you!" shouted the tramp who stood next to him.\r\n"Have you taken it or not?"\r\n\r\n"Dying, I tell you; what more do you want?" some one else was screaming\r\nat his other side. Maslova could not hear what Nekhludoff was saying,\r\nbut the expression of his face as he was speaking reminded her of him.\r\nShe did not believe her own eyes; still the smile vanished from her face\r\nand a deep line of suffering appeared on her brow.\r\n\r\n"I cannot hear what you are saying," she called out, wrinkling her brow\r\nand frowning more and more.\r\n\r\n"I have come," said Nekhludoff. "Yes, I am doing my duty--I am\r\nconfessing," thought Nekhludoff; and at this thought the tears came in\r\nhis eyes, and he felt a choking sensation in his throat, and holding on\r\nwith both hands to the net, he made efforts to keep from bursting into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"I say, why do you shove yourself in where you\'re not wanted?" some one\r\nshouted at one side of him.\r\n\r\n"God is my witness; I know nothing," screamed a prisoner from the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\nNoticing his excitement, Maslova recognised him.\r\n\r\n"You\'re like . . . but no; I don\'t know you," she shouted, without\r\nlooking at him, and blushing, while her face grew still more stern.\r\n\r\n"I have come to ask you to forgive me," he said, in a loud but\r\nmonotonous voice, like a lesson learnt by heart. Having said these words\r\nhe became confused; but immediately came the thought that, if he felt\r\nashamed, it was all the better; he had to bear this shame, and he\r\ncontinued in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n"Forgive me; I have wronged you terribly."\r\n\r\nShe stood motionless and without taking her squinting eyes off him.\r\n\r\nHe could not continue to speak, and stepping away from the net he tried\r\nto suppress the sobs that were choking him.\r\n\r\nThe inspector, the same officer who had directed Nekhludoff to the\r\nwomen\'s ward, and whose interest he seemed to have aroused, came into\r\nthe room, and, seeing Nekhludoff not at the net, asked him why he was\r\nnot talking to her whom he wanted to see. Nekhludoff blew his nose, gave\r\nhimself a shake, and, trying to appear calm, said:\r\n\r\n"It\'s so inconvenient through these nets; nothing can be heard."\r\n\r\nAgain the inspector considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, she can be brought out here for awhile. Mary Karlovna,"\r\nturning to the warder, "lead Maslova out."\r\n\r\nA minute later Maslova came out of the side door. Stepping softly, she\r\ncame up close to Nekhludoff, stopped, and looked up at him from under\r\nher brows. Her black hair was arranged in ringlets over her forehead in\r\nthe same way as it had been two days ago; her face, though unhealthy and\r\npuffy, was attractive, and looked perfectly calm, only the glittering\r\nblack eyes glanced strangely from under the swollen lids.\r\n\r\n"You may talk here," said the inspector, and shrugging his shoulders he\r\nstepped aside with a look of surprise. Nekhludoff moved towards a seat\r\nby the wall.\r\n\r\nMaslova cast a questioning look at the inspector, and then, shrugging\r\nher shoulders in surprise, followed Nekhludoff to the bench, and having\r\narranged her skirt, sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n"I know it is hard for you to forgive me," he began, but stopped. His\r\ntears were choking him. "But though I can\'t undo the past, I shall now\r\ndo what is in my power. Tell me--"\r\n\r\n"How have you managed to find me?" she said, without answering his\r\nquestion, neither looking away from him nor quite at him, with her\r\nsquinting eyes.\r\n\r\n"O God, help me! Teach me what to do," Nekhludoff thought, looking at\r\nher changed face. "I was on the jury the day before yesterday," he said.\r\n"You did not recognise me?"\r\n\r\n"No, I did not; there was not time for recognitions. I did not even\r\nlook," she said.\r\n\r\n"There was a child, was there not?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Thank God! he died at once," she answered, abruptly and viciously.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? Why?"\r\n\r\n"I was so ill myself, I nearly died," she said, in the same quiet voice,\r\nwhich Nekhludoff had not expected and could not understand.\r\n\r\n"How could my aunts have let you go?"\r\n\r\n"Who keeps a servant that has a baby? They sent me off as soon as\r\nthey noticed. But why speak of this? I remember nothing. That\'s all\r\nfinished."\r\n\r\n"No, it is not finished; I wish to redeem my sin."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to redeem. What\'s been has been and is passed," she\r\nsaid; and, what he never expected, she looked at him and smiled in an\r\nunpleasantly luring, yet piteous, manner.\r\n\r\nMaslova never expected to see him again, and certainly not here and not\r\nnow; therefore, when she first recognised him, she could not keep back\r\nthe memories which she never wished to revive. In the first moment she\r\nremembered dimly that new, wonderful world of feeling and of thought\r\nwhich had been opened to her by the charming young man who loved her\r\nand whom she loved, and then his incomprehensible cruelty and the whole\r\nstring of humiliations and suffering which flowed from and followed that\r\nmagic joy. This gave her pain, and, unable to understand it, she did\r\nwhat she was always in the habit of doing, she got rid of these memories\r\nby enveloping them in the mist of a depraved life. In the first moment,\r\nshe associated the man now sitting beside her with the lad she had\r\nloved; but feeling that this gave her pain, she dissociated them again.\r\nNow, this well-dressed, carefully-got-up gentleman with perfumed beard\r\nwas no longer the Nekhludoff whom she had loved but only one of the\r\npeople who made use of creatures like herself when they needed them,\r\nand whom creatures like herself had to make use of in their turn as\r\nprofitably as they could; and that is why she looked at him with a\r\nluring smile and considered silently how she could best make use of him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all at an end," she said. "Now I\'m condemned to Siberia," and\r\nher lip trembled as she was saying this dreadful word.\r\n\r\n"I knew; I was certain you were not guilty," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Guilty! of course not; as if I could be a thief or a robber." She\r\nstopped, considering in what way she could best get something out of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"They say here that all depends on the advocate," she began. "A petition\r\nshould be handed in, only they say it\'s expensive."\r\n\r\n"Yes, most certainly," said Nekhludoff. "I have already spoken to an\r\nadvocate."\r\n\r\n"No money ought to be spared; it should be a good one," she said.\r\n\r\n"I shall do all that is possible."\r\n\r\nThey were silent, and then she smiled again in the same way.\r\n\r\n"And I should like to ask you . . . a little money if you can . . . not\r\nmuch; ten roubles, I do not want more," she said, suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," Nekhludoff said, with a sense of confusion, and felt for his\r\npurse.\r\n\r\nShe looked rapidly at the inspector, who was walking up and down the\r\nroom. "Don\'t give it in front of him; he\'d take it away."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff took out his purse as soon as the inspector had turned his\r\nback; but had no time to hand her the note before the inspector faced\r\nthem again, so he crushed it up in his hand.\r\n\r\n"This woman is dead," Nekhludoff thought, looking at this once sweet,\r\nand now defiled, puffy face, lit up by an evil glitter in the black,\r\nsquinting eyes which were now glancing at the hand in which he held\r\nthe note, then following the inspector\'s movements, and for a moment he\r\nhesitated. The tempter that had been speaking to him in the night again\r\nraised its voice, trying to lead him out of the realm of his inner into\r\nthe realm of his outer life, away from the question of what he should\r\ndo to the question of what the consequences would be, and what would be\r\npractical.\r\n\r\n"You can do nothing with this woman," said the voice; "you will only\r\ntie a stone round your neck, which will help to drown you and hinder you\r\nfrom being useful to others.\r\n\r\n"Is it not better to give her all the money that is here, say good-bye,\r\nand finish with her forever?" whispered the voice.\r\n\r\nBut here he felt that now, at this very moment, something most important\r\nwas taking place in his soul--that his inner life was, as it were,\r\nwavering in the balance, so that the slightest effort would make it sink\r\nto this side or the other. And he made this effort by calling to his\r\nassistance that God whom he had felt in his soul the day before, and\r\nthat God instantly responded. He resolved to tell her everything now--at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"Katusha, I have come to ask you to forgive me, and you have given me no\r\nanswer. Have you forgiven me? Will you ever forgive me?" he asked.\r\n\r\nShe did not listen to him, but looked at his hand and at the inspector,\r\nand when the latter turned she hastily stretched out her hand, grasped\r\nthe note, and hid it under her belt.\r\n\r\n"That\'s odd, what you are saying there," she said, with a smile of\r\ncontempt, as it seemed to him.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt that there was in her soul one who was his enemy and who\r\nwas protecting her, such as she was now, and preventing him from getting\r\nat her heart. But, strange to say, this did not repel him, but drew him\r\nnearer to her by some fresh, peculiar power. He knew that he must waken\r\nher soul, that this was terribly difficult, but the very difficulty\r\nattracted him. He now felt towards her as he had never felt towards her\r\nor any one else before. There was nothing personal in this feeling: he\r\nwanted nothing from her for himself, but only wished that she might not\r\nremain as she now was, that she might awaken and become again what she\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n"Katusha, why do you speak like that? I know you; I remember you--and\r\nthe old days in Papovo."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of recalling what\'s past?" she remarked, drily.\r\n\r\n"I am recalling it in order to put it right, to atone for my sin,\r\nKatusha," and he was going to say that he would marry her, but,\r\nmeeting her eyes, he read in them something so dreadful, so coarse, so\r\nrepellent, that he could not go on.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the visitors began to go. The inspector came up to\r\nNekhludoff and said that the time was up.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye; I have still much to say to you, but you see it is impossible\r\nto do so now," said Nekhludoff, and held out his hand. "I shall come\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"I think you have said all."\r\n\r\nShe took his hand but did not press it.\r\n\r\n"No; I shall try to see you again, somewhere where we can talk, and then\r\nI shall tell you what I have to say-something very important."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, come; why not?" she answered, and smiled with that\r\nhabitual, inviting, and promising smile which she gave to the men whom\r\nshe wished to please.\r\n\r\n"You are more than a sister to me," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"That\'s odd," she said again, and went behind the grating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA\'S VIEW OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nBefore the first interview, Nekhludoff thought that when she saw him\r\nand knew of his intention to serve her, Katusha would be pleased and\r\ntouched, and would be Katusha again; but, to his horror, he found\r\nthat Katusha existed no more, and there was Maslova in her place. This\r\nastonished and horrified him.\r\n\r\nWhat astonished him most was that Katusha was not ashamed of her\r\nposition--not the position of a prisoner (she was ashamed of that), but\r\nher position as a prostitute. She seemed satisfied, even proud of it.\r\nAnd, yet, how could it be otherwise? Everybody, in order to be able to\r\nact, has to consider his occupation important and good. Therefore, in\r\nwhatever position a person is, he is certain to form such a view of the\r\nlife of men in general which will make his occupation seem important and\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIt is usually imagined that a thief, a murderer, a spy, a prostitute,\r\nacknowledging his or her profession as evil, is ashamed of it. But the\r\ncontrary is true. People whom fate and their sin-mistakes have placed in\r\na certain position, however false that position may be, form a view of\r\nlife in general which makes their position seem good and admissible. In\r\norder to keep up their view of life, these people instinctively keep to\r\nthe circle of those people who share their views of life and their own\r\nplace in it. This surprises us, where the persons concerned are thieves,\r\nbragging about their dexterity, prostitutes vaunting their depravity, or\r\nmurderers boasting of their cruelty. This surprises us only because the\r\ncircle, the atmosphere in which these people live, is limited, and we\r\nare outside it. But can we not observe the same phenomenon when the rich\r\nboast of their wealth, i.e., robbery; the commanders in the army pride\r\nthemselves on victories, i.e., murder; and those in high places vaunt\r\ntheir power, i.e., violence? We do not see the perversion in the views\r\nof life held by these people, only because the circle formed by them is\r\nmore extensive, and we ourselves are moving inside of it.\r\n\r\nAnd in this manner Maslova had formed her views of life and of her own\r\nposition. She was a prostitute condemned to Siberia, and yet she had a\r\nconception of life which made it possible for her to be satisfied with\r\nherself, and even to pride herself on her position before others.\r\n\r\nAccording to this conception, the highest good for all men without\r\nexception--old, young, schoolboys, generals, educated and uneducated,\r\nwas connected with the relation of the sexes; therefore, all men, even\r\nwhen they pretended to be occupied with other things, in reality\r\ntook this view. She was an attractive woman, and therefore she was an\r\nimportant and necessary person. The whole of her former and present life\r\nwas a confirmation of the correctness of this conception.\r\n\r\nWith such a view of life, she was by no means the lowest, but a very\r\nimportant person. And Maslova prized this view of life more than\r\nanything; she could not but prize it, for, if she lost the importance\r\nthat such a view of life gave her among men, she would lose the meaning\r\nof her life. And, in order not to lose the meaning of her life, she\r\ninstinctively clung to the set that looked at life in the same way as\r\nshe did. Feeling that Nekhludoff wanted to lead her out into another\r\nworld, she resisted him, foreseeing that she would have to lose her\r\nplace in life, with the self-possession and self-respect it gave her.\r\nFor this reason she drove from her the recollections of her early youth\r\nand her first relations with Nekhludoff. These recollections did not\r\ncorrespond with her present conception of the world, and were therefore\r\nquite rubbed out of her mind, or, rather, lay somewhere buried and\r\nuntouched, closed up and plastered over so that they should not escape,\r\nas when bees, in order to protect the result of their labour, will\r\nsometimes plaster a nest of worms. Therefore, the present Nekhludoff\r\nwas not the man she had once loved with a pure love, but only a rich\r\ngentleman whom she could, and must, make use of, and with whom she could\r\nonly have the same relations as with men in general.\r\n\r\n"No, I could not tell her the chief thing," thought Nekhludoff, moving\r\ntowards the front doors with the rest of the people. "I did not tell her\r\nthat I would marry her; I did not tell her so, but I will," he thought.\r\n\r\nThe two warders at the door let out the visitors, counting them again,\r\nand touching each one with their hands, so that no extra person should\r\ngo out, and none remain within. The slap on his shoulder did not offend\r\nNekhludoff this time; he did not even notice it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nFANARIN, THE ADVOCATE--THE PETITION.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff meant to rearrange the whole of his external life, to let\r\nhis large house and move to an hotel, but Agraphena Petrovna pointed out\r\nthat it was useless to change anything before the winter. No one would\r\nrent a town house for the summer; anyhow, he would have to live and keep\r\nhis things somewhere. And so all his efforts to change his manner\r\nof life (he meant to live more simply: as the students live) led to\r\nnothing. Not only did everything remain as it was, but the house was\r\nsuddenly filled with new activity. All that was made of wool or fur was\r\ntaken out to be aired and beaten. The gate-keeper, the boy, the cook,\r\nand Corney himself took part in this activity. All sorts of strange\r\nfurs, which no one ever used, and various uniforms were taken out and\r\nhung on a line, then the carpets and furniture were brought out, and the\r\ngate-keeper and the boy rolled their sleeves up their muscular arms and\r\nstood beating these things, keeping strict time, while the rooms were\r\nfilled with the smell of naphthaline.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff crossed the yard or looked out of the window and saw\r\nall this going on, he was surprised at the great number of things there\r\nwere, all quite useless. Their only use, Nekhludoff thought, was the\r\nproviding of exercise for Agraphena Petrovna, Corney, the gate-keeper,\r\nthe boy, and the cook.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s not worth while altering my manner of life now," he thought,\r\n"while Maslova\'s case is not decided. Besides, it is too difficult. It\r\nwill alter of itself when she will be set free or exiled, and I follow\r\nher."\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day Nekhludoff drove up to the advocate Fanarin\'s own\r\nsplendid house, which was decorated with huge palms and other plants,\r\nand wonderful curtains, in fact, with all the expensive luxury\r\nwitnessing to the possession of much idle money, i.e., money acquired\r\nwithout labour, which only those possess who grow rich suddenly. In\r\nthe waiting-room, just as in a doctor\'s waiting-room, he found many\r\ndejected-looking people sitting round several tables, on which lay\r\nillustrated papers meant to amuse them, awaiting their turns to be\r\nadmitted to the advocate. The advocate\'s assistant sat in the room at a\r\nhigh desk, and having recognised Nekhludoff, he came up to him and said\r\nhe would go and announce him at once. But the assistant had not reached\r\nthe door before it opened and the sounds of loud, animated voices were\r\nheard; the voice of a middle-aged, sturdy merchant, with a red face and\r\nthick moustaches, and the voice of Fanarin himself. Fanarin was also\r\na middle-aged man of medium height, with a worn look on his face. Both\r\nfaces bore the expression which you see on the faces of those who have\r\njust concluded a profitable but not quite honest transaction.\r\n\r\n"Your own fault, you know, my dear sir," Fanarin said, smiling.\r\n\r\n"We\'d all be in \'eaven were it not for hour sins."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes; we all know that," and both laughed un-naturally.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Prince Nekhludoff! Please to step in," said Fanarin, seeing him,\r\nand, nodding once more to the merchant, he led Nekhludoff into his\r\nbusiness cabinet, furnished in a severely correct style.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you smoke?" said the advocate, sitting down opposite Nekhludoff\r\nand trying to conceal a smile, apparently still excited by the success\r\nof the accomplished transaction.\r\n\r\n"Thanks; I have come about Maslova\'s case."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; directly! But oh, what rogues these fat money bags are!"\r\nhe said. "You saw this here fellow. Why, he has about twelve million\r\nroubles, and he cannot speak correctly; and if he can get a twenty-five\r\nrouble note out of you he\'ll have it, if he\'s to wrench it out with his\r\nteeth."\r\n\r\n"He says \'\'eaven\' and \'hour,\' and you say \'this here fellow,\'"\r\nNekhludoff thought, with an insurmountable feeling of aversion towards\r\nthis man who wished to show by his free and easy manner that he and\r\nNekhludoff belonged to one and the same camp, while his other clients\r\nbelonged to another.\r\n\r\n"He has worried me to death--a fearful scoundrel. I felt I must relieve\r\nmy feelings," said the advocate, as if to excuse his speaking about\r\nthings that had no reference to business. "Well, how about your case?\r\nI have read it attentively, but do not approve of it. I mean that\r\ngreenhorn of an advocate has left no valid reason for an appeal."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what have you decided?"\r\n\r\n"One moment. Tell him," he said to his assistant, who had just come in,\r\n"that I keep to what I have said. If he can, it\'s all right; if not, no\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"But he won\'t agree."\r\n\r\n"Well, no matter," and the advocate frowned.\r\n\r\n"There now, and it is said that we advocates get our money for nothing,"\r\nhe remarked, after a pause. "I have freed one insolvent debtor from a\r\ntotally false charge, and now they all flock to me. Yet every such case\r\ncosts enormous labour. Why, don\'t we, too, \'lose bits of flesh in the\r\ninkstand?\' as some writer or other has said. Well, as to your case, or,\r\nrather, the case you are taking an interest in. It has been conducted\r\nabominably. There is no good reason for appealing. Still," he continued,\r\n"we can but try to get the sentence revoked. This is what I have noted\r\ndown." He took up several sheets of paper covered with writing, and\r\nbegan to read rapidly, slurring over the uninteresting legal terms and\r\nlaying particular stress on some sentences. "To the Court of Appeal,\r\ncriminal department, etc., etc. According to the decisions, etc., the\r\nverdict, etc., So-and-so Maslova pronounced guilty of having caused the\r\ndeath through poison of the merchant Smelkoff, and has, according to\r\nStatute 1454 of the penal code, been sentenced to Siberia," etc., etc.\r\nHe stopped. Evidently, in spite of his being so used to it, he still\r\nfelt pleasure in listening to his own productions. "This sentence is\r\nthe direct result of the most glaring judicial perversion and error,"\r\nhe continued, impressively, "and there are grounds for its revocation.\r\nFirstly, the reading of the medical report of the examination of\r\nSmelkoff\'s intestines was interrupted by the president at the very\r\nbeginning. This is point one."\r\n\r\n"But it was the prosecuting side that demanded this reading," Nekhludoff\r\nsaid, with surprise.\r\n\r\n"That does not matter. There might have been reasons for the defence to\r\ndemand this reading, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but there could have been no reason whatever for that."\r\n\r\n"It is a ground for appeal, though. To continue: \'Secondly,\' he went\r\non reading, \'when Maslova\'s advocate, in his speech for the defence,\r\nwishing to characterise Maslova\'s personality, referred to the causes of\r\nher fall, he was interrupted by the president calling him to order\r\nfor the alleged deviation from the direct subject. Yet, as has been\r\nrepeatedly pointed out by the Senate, the elucidation of the criminal\'s\r\ncharacteristics and his or her moral standpoint in general has a\r\nsignificance of the first importance in criminal cases, even if only\r\nas a guide in the settling of the question of imputation.\' That\'s point\r\ntwo," he said, with a look at Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"But he spoke so badly that no one could make anything of it,"\r\nNekhludoff said, still more astonished.\r\n\r\n"The fellow\'s quite a fool, and of course could not be expected to say\r\nanything sensible," Fanarin said, laughing; "but, all the same, it will\r\ndo as a reason for appeal. Thirdly: \'The president, in his summing up,\r\ncontrary to the direct decree of section 1, statute 801, of the criminal\r\ncode, omitted to inform the jury what the judicial points are that\r\nconstitute guilt; and did not mention that having admitted the fact of\r\nMaslova having administered the poison to Smelkoff, the jury had a right\r\nnot to impute the guilt of murder to her, since the proofs of wilful\r\nintent to deprive Smelkoff of life were absent, and only to pronounce\r\nher guilty of carelessness resulting in the death of the merchant, which\r\nshe did not desire.\' This is the chief point."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but we ought to have known that ourselves. It was our mistake."\r\n\r\n"And now the fourth point," the advocate continued. "The form of the\r\nanswer given by the jury contained an evident contradiction. Maslova\r\nis accused of wilfully poisoning Smelkoff, her one object being that of\r\ncupidity, the only motive to commit murder she could have had. The jury\r\nin their verdict acquit her of the intent to rob, or participation in\r\nthe stealing of valuables, from which it follows that they intended\r\nalso to acquit her of the intent to murder, and only through a\r\nmisunderstanding, which arose from the incompleteness of the president\'s\r\nsumming up, omitted to express it in due form in their answer. Therefore\r\nan answer of this kind by the jury absolutely demanded the application\r\nof statutes 816 and 808 of the criminal code of procedure, i.e., an\r\nexplanation by the president to the jury of the mistake made by them,\r\nand another debate on the question of the prisoner\'s guilt."\r\n\r\n"Then why did the president not do it?"\r\n\r\n"I, too, should like to know why," Fanarin said, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Then the Senate will, of course, correct this error?"\r\n\r\n"That will all depend on who will preside there at the time. Well, now,\r\nthere it is. I have further said," he continued, rapidly, "a verdict of\r\nthis kind gave the Court no right to condemn Maslova to be punished as\r\na criminal, and to apply section 3, statute 771 of the penal code to her\r\ncase. This is a decided and gross violation of the basic principles of\r\nour criminal law. In view of the reasons stated, I have the honour of\r\nappealing to you, etc., etc., the refutation, according to 909, 910, and\r\nsection 2, 912 and 928 statute of the criminal code, etc., etc. . . .\r\nto carry this case before another department of the same Court for a\r\nfurther examination. There; all that can be done is done, but, to be\r\nfrank, I have little hope of success, though, of course, it all depends\r\non what members will be present at the Senate. If you have any influence\r\nthere you can but try."\r\n\r\n"I do know some."\r\n\r\n"All right; only be quick about it. Else they\'ll all go off for a change\r\nof air; then you may have to wait three months before they return. Then,\r\nin case of failure, we have still the possibility of appealing to His\r\nMajesty. This, too, depends on the private influence you can bring to\r\nwork. In this case, too, I am at your service; I mean as to the working\r\nof the petition, not the influence."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Now as to your fees?"\r\n\r\n"My assistant will hand you the petition and tell you."\r\n\r\n"One thing more. The Procureur gave me a pass for visiting this person\r\nin prison, but they tell me I must also get a permission from the\r\ngovernor in order to get an interview at another time and in another\r\nplace than those appointed. Is this necessary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so. But the governor is away at present; a vice-governor\r\nis in his place. And he is such an impenetrable fool that you\'ll\r\nscarcely be able to do anything with him."\r\n\r\n"Is it Meslennikoff?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I know him," said Nekhludoff, and got up to go. At this moment a\r\nhorribly ugly, little, bony, snub-nosed, yellow-faced woman flew into\r\nthe room. It was the advocate\'s wife, who did not seem to be in the\r\nleast bit troubled by her ugliness. She was attired in the most original\r\nmanner; she seemed enveloped in something made of velvet and silk,\r\nsomething yellow and green, and her thin hair was crimped.\r\n\r\nShe stepped out triumphantly into the ante-room, followed by a tall,\r\nsmiling man, with a greenish complexion, dressed in a coat with silk\r\nfacings, and a white tie. This was an author. Nekhludoff knew him by\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nShe opened the cabinet door and said, "Anatole, you must come to\r\nme. Here is Simeon Ivanovitch, who will read his poems, and you must\r\nabsolutely come and read about Garshin."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff noticed that she whispered something to her husband, and,\r\nthinking it was something concerning him, wished to go away, but she\r\ncaught him up and said: "I beg your pardon, Prince, I know you, and,\r\nthinking an introduction superfluous, I beg you to stay and take part\r\nin our literary matinee. It will be most interesting. M. Fanarin will\r\nread."\r\n\r\n"You see what a lot I have to do," said Fanarin, spreading out his hands\r\nand smilingly pointing to his wife, as if to show how impossible it was\r\nto resist so charming a creature.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thanked the advocate\'s wife with extreme politeness for the\r\nhonour she did him in inviting him, but refused the invitation with a\r\nsad and solemn look, and left the room.\r\n\r\n"What an affected fellow!" said the advocate\'s wife, when he had gone\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn the ante-room the assistant handed him a ready-written petition,\r\nand said that the fees, including the business with the Senate and the\r\ncommission, would come to 1,000 roubles, and explained that M. Fanarin\r\ndid not usually undertake this kind of business, but did it only to\r\noblige Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"And about this petition. Who is to sign it?"\r\n\r\n"The prisoner may do it herself, or if this is inconvenient, M. Fanarin\r\ncan, if he gets a power of attorney from her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. I shall take the petition to her and get her to sign it," said\r\nNekhludoff, glad of the opportunity of seeing her before the appointed\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nA PRISON FLOGGING.\r\n\r\nAt the usual time the jailer\'s whistle sounded in the corridors of the\r\nprison, the iron doors of the cells rattled, bare feet pattered, heels\r\nclattered, and the prisoners who acted as scavengers passed along the\r\ncorridors, filling the air with disgusting smells. The prisoners washed,\r\ndressed, and came out for revision, then went to get boiling water for\r\ntheir tea.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at breakfast in all the cells was very lively. It was\r\nall about two prisoners who were to be flogged that day. One, Vasiliev,\r\nwas a young man of some education, a clerk, who had killed his mistress\r\nin a fit of jealousy. His fellow-prisoners liked him because he\r\nwas merry and generous and firm in his behaviour with the prison\r\nauthorities. He knew the laws and insisted on their being carried out.\r\nTherefore he was disliked by the authorities. Three weeks before a\r\njailer struck one of the scavengers who had spilt some soup over his new\r\nuniform. Vasiliev took the part of the scavenger, saying that it was not\r\nlawful to strike a prisoner.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll teach you the law," said the jailer, and gave Vasiliev a scolding.\r\nVasiliev replied in like manner, and the jailer was going to hit him,\r\nbut Vasiliev seized the jailer\'s hands, held them fast for about three\r\nminutes, and, after giving the hands a twist, pushed the jailer out of\r\nthe door. The jailer complained to the inspector, who ordered Vasiliev\r\nto be put into a solitary cell.\r\n\r\nThe solitary cells were a row of dark closets, locked from outside, and\r\nthere were neither beds, nor chairs, nor tables in them, so that the\r\ninmates had to sit or lie on the dirty floor, while the rats, of which\r\nthere were a great many in those cells, ran across them. The rats were\r\nso bold that they stole the bread from the prisoners, and even attacked\r\nthem if they stopped moving. Vasiliev said he would not go into the\r\nsolitary cell, because he had not done anything wrong; but they used\r\nforce. Then he began struggling, and two other prisoners helped him to\r\nfree himself from the jailers. All the jailers assembled, and among them\r\nwas Petrov, who was distinguished for his strength. The prisoners got\r\nthrown down and pushed into the solitary cells.\r\n\r\nThe governor was immediately informed that something very like a\r\nrebellion had taken place. And he sent back an order to flog the two\r\nchief offenders, Vasiliev and the tramp, Nepomnishy, giving each thirty\r\nstrokes with a birch rod. The flogging was appointed to take place in\r\nthe women\'s interviewing-room.\r\n\r\nAll this was known in the prison since the evening, and it was being\r\ntalked about with animation in all the cells.\r\n\r\nKorableva, Khoroshevka, Theodosia, and Maslova sat together in their\r\ncorner, drinking tea, all of them flushed and animated by the vodka they\r\nhad drunk, for Maslova, who now had a constant supply of vodka, freely\r\ntreated her companions to it.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not been a-rioting, or anything," Korableva said, referring to\r\nVasiliev, as she bit tiny pieces off a lump of sugar with her strong\r\nteeth. "He only stuck up for a chum, because it\'s not lawful to strike\r\nprisoners nowadays."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s a fine fellow, I\'ve heard say," said Theodosia, who sat\r\nbareheaded, with her long plaits round her head, on a log of wood\r\nopposite the shelf bedstead on which the teapot stood.\r\n\r\n"There, now, if you were to ask _him_," the watchman\'s wife said to\r\nMaslova (by him she meant Nekhludoff).\r\n\r\n"I shall tell him. He\'ll do anything for me," Maslova said, tossing her\r\nhead, and smiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but when is he coming? and they\'ve already gone to fetch them,"\r\nsaid Theodosia. "It is terrible," she added, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n"I once did see how they flogged a peasant in the village.\r\nFather-in-law, he sent me once to the village elder. Well, I went,\r\nand there . . . " The watchman\'s wife began her long story, which was\r\ninterrupted by the sound of voices and steps in the corridor above them.\r\n\r\nThe women were silent, and sat listening.\r\n\r\n"There they are, hauling him along, the devils!" Khoroshavka said.\r\n"They\'ll do him to death, they will. The jailers are so enraged with him\r\nbecause he never would give in to them."\r\n\r\nAll was quiet again upstairs, and the watchman\'s wife finished her story\r\nof how she was that frightened when she went into the barn and saw\r\nthem flogging a peasant, her inside turned at the sight, and so on.\r\nKhoroshevka related how Schegloff had been flogged, and never uttered\r\na sound. Then Theodosia put away the tea things, and Korableva and the\r\nwatchman\'s wife took up their sewing. Maslova sat down on the bedstead,\r\nwith her arms round her knees, dull and depressed. She was about to lie\r\ndown and try to sleep, when the woman warder called her into the office\r\nto see a visitor.\r\n\r\n"Now, mind, and don\'t forget to tell him about us," the old woman\r\n(Menshova) said, while Maslova was arranging the kerchief on her head\r\nbefore the dim looking-glass. "We did not set fire to the house, but he\r\nhimself, the fiend, did it; his workman saw him do it, and will not damn\r\nhis soul by denying it. You just tell to ask to see my Mitri. Mitri\r\nwill tell him all about it, as plain as can be. Just think of our being\r\nlocked up in prison when we never dreamt of any ill, while he, the\r\nfiend, is enjoying himself at the pub, with another man\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the law," remarked Korableva.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him--I\'ll tell him," answered Maslova. "Suppose I have\r\nanother drop, just to keep up courage," she added, with a wink; and\r\nKorableva poured out half a cup of vodka, which Maslova drank. Then,\r\nhaving wiped her mouth and repeating the words "just to keep up\r\ncourage," tossing her head and smiling gaily, she followed the warder\r\nalong the corridor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF AGAIN VISITS MASLOVA.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had to wait in the hall for a long time. When he had arrived\r\nat the prison and rung at the entrance door, he handed the permission of\r\nthe Procureur to the jailer on duty who met him.\r\n\r\n"No, no," the jailer on duty said hurriedly, "the inspector is engaged."\r\n\r\n"In the office?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No, here in the interviewing-room.".\r\n\r\n"Why, is it a visiting day to-day?"\r\n\r\n"No; it\'s special business."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see him. What am I to do?" said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"When the inspector comes out you\'ll tell him--wait a bit," said the\r\njailer.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a sergeant-major, with a smooth, shiny face and\r\nmoustaches impregnated with tobacco smoke, came out of a side door, with\r\nthe gold cords of his uniform glistening, and addressed the jailer in a\r\nsevere tone.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by letting any one in here? The office. . . ."\r\n\r\n"I was told the inspector was here," said Nekhludoff, surprised at the\r\nagitation he noticed in the sergeant-major\'s manner.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the inner door opened, and Petrov came out, heated and\r\nperspiring.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll remember it," he muttered, turning to the sergeant major. The\r\nlatter pointed at Nekhludoff by a look, and Petrov knitted his brows and\r\nwent out through a door at the back.\r\n\r\n"Who will remember it? Why do they all seem so confused? Why did the\r\nsergeant-major make a sign to him?" Nekhludoff thought.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-major, again addressing Nekhludoff, said: "You cannot meet\r\nhere; please step across to the office." And Nekhludoff was about to\r\ncomply when the inspector came out of the door at the back, looking even\r\nmore confused than his subordinates, and sighing continually. When he\r\nsaw Nekhludoff he turned to the jailer.\r\n\r\n"Fedotoff, have Maslova, cell 5, women\'s ward, taken to the office."\r\n\r\n"Will you come this way, please," he said, turning to Nekhludoff. They\r\nascended a steep staircase and entered a little room with one window, a\r\nwriting-table, and a few chairs in it. The inspector sat down.\r\n\r\n"Mine are heavy, heavy duties," he remarked, again addressing\r\nNekhludoff, and took out a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"You are tired, evidently," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Tired of the whole of the service--the duties are very trying. One\r\ntries to lighten their lot and only makes it worse; my only thought is\r\nhow to get away. Heavy, heavy duties!"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff did not know what the inspector\'s particular difficulties\r\nwere, but he saw that to-day he was in a peculiarly dejected and\r\nhopeless condition, calling for pity.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I should think the duties were heavy for a kind-hearted man," he\r\nsaid. "Why do you serve in this capacity?"\r\n\r\n"I have a family."\r\n\r\n"But, if it is so hard--"\r\n\r\n"Well, still you know it is possible to be of use in some measure; I\r\nsoften down all I can. Another in my place would conduct the affairs\r\nquite differently. Why, we have more than 2,000 persons here. And what\r\npersons! One must know how to manage them. It is easier said than done,\r\nyou know. After all, they are also men; one cannot help pitying them."\r\nThe inspector began telling Nekhludoff of a fight that had lately taken\r\nplace among the convicts, which had ended by one man being killed.\r\n\r\nThe story was interrupted by the entrance of Maslova, who was\r\naccompanied by a jailer.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff saw her through the doorway before she had noticed the\r\ninspector. She was following the warder briskly, smiling and tossing her\r\nhead. When she saw the inspector she suddenly changed, and gazed at\r\nhim with a frightened look; but, quickly recovering, she addressed\r\nNekhludoff boldly and gaily.\r\n\r\n"How d\'you do?" she said, drawling out her words, and smilingly took his\r\nhand and shook it vigorously, not like the first time.\r\n\r\n"Here, I\'ve brought you a petition to sign," said Nekhludoff, rather\r\nsurprised by the boldness with which she greeted him to-day.\r\n\r\n"The advocate has written out a petition which you will have to sign,\r\nand then we shall send it to Petersburg."\r\n\r\n"All right! That can be done. Anything you like," she said, with a wink\r\nand a smile.\r\n\r\nAnd Nekhludoff drew a folded paper from his pocket and went up to the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"May she sign it here?" asked Nekhludoff, turning to the inspector.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, it\'s all right! Sit down. Here\'s a pen; you can write?"\r\nsaid the inspector.\r\n\r\n"I could at one time," she said; and, after arranging her skirt and the\r\nsleeves of her jacket, she sat down at the table, smiled awkwardly, took\r\nthe pen with her small, energetic hand, and glanced at Nekhludoff with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff told her what to write and pointed out the place where to\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nSighing deeply as she dipped her pen into the ink, and carefully shaking\r\nsome drops off the pen, she wrote her name.\r\n\r\n"Is it all?" she asked, looking from Nekhludoff to the inspector, and\r\nputting the pen now on the inkstand, now on the papers.\r\n\r\n"I have a few words to tell you," Nekhludoff said, taking the pen from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"All right; tell me," she said. And suddenly, as if remembering\r\nsomething, or feeling sleepy, she grew serious.\r\n\r\nThe inspector rose and left the room, and Nekhludoff remained with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA REFUSES TO MARRY.\r\n\r\nThe jailer who had brought Maslova in sat on a windowsill at some\r\ndistance from them.\r\n\r\nThe decisive moment had come for Nekhludoff. He had been incessantly\r\nblaming himself for not having told her the principal thing at the first\r\ninterview, and was now determined to tell her that he would marry her.\r\nShe was sitting at the further side of the table. Nekhludoff sat down\r\nopposite her. It was light in the room, and Nekhludoff for the first\r\ntime saw her face quite near. He distinctly saw the crowsfeet round her\r\neyes, the wrinkles round her mouth, and the swollen eyelids. He felt\r\nmore sorry than before. Leaning over the table so as not to be heard by\r\nthe jailer--a man of Jewish type with grizzly whiskers, who sat by the\r\nwindow--Nekhludoff said:\r\n\r\n"Should this petition come to nothing we shall appeal to the Emperor.\r\nAll that is possible shall be done."\r\n\r\n"There, now, if we had had a proper advocate from the first," she\r\ninterrupted. "My defendant was quite a silly. He did nothing but pay me\r\ncompliments," she said, and laughed. "If it had then been known that I\r\nwas acquainted with you, it would have been another matter. They think\r\nevery one\'s a thief."\r\n\r\n"How strange she is to-day," Nekhludoff thought, and was just going to\r\nsay what he had on his mind when she began again:\r\n\r\n"There\'s something I want to say. We have here an old woman; such a fine\r\none, d\'you know, she just surprises every one; she is imprisoned for\r\nnothing, and her son, too, and everybody knows they are innocent, though\r\nthey are accused of having set fire to a house. D\'you know, hearing I\r\nwas acquainted with you, she says: \'Tell him to ask to see my son; he\'ll\r\ntell him all about it."\' Thus spoke Maslova, turning her head from side\r\nto side, and glancing at Nekhludoff. "Their name\'s Menshoff. Well, will\r\nyou do it? Such a fine old thing, you know; you can see at once she\'s\r\ninnocent. You\'ll do it, there\'s a dear," and she smiled, glanced up at\r\nhim, and then cast down her eyes.\r\n\r\n"All right. I\'ll find out about them," Nekhludoff said, more and more\r\nastonished by her free-and-easy manner. "But I was going to speak to you\r\nabout myself. Do you remember what I told you last time?"\r\n\r\n"You said a lot last time. What was it you told me?" she said,\r\ncontinuing to smile and to turn her head from side to side.\r\n\r\n"I said I had come to ask you to forgive me," he began.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of that? Forgive, forgive, where\'s the good of--"\r\n\r\n"To atone for my sin, not by mere words, but in deed. I have made up my\r\nmind to marry you."\r\n\r\nAn expression of fear suddenly came over her face. Her squinting eyes\r\nremained fixed on him, and yet seemed not to be looking at him.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that for?" she said, with an angry frown.\r\n\r\n"I feel that it is my duty before God to do it."\r\n\r\n"What God have you found now? You are not saying what you ought to. God,\r\nindeed! What God? You ought to have remembered God then," she said, and\r\nstopped with her mouth open. It was only now that Nekhludoff noticed\r\nthat her breath smelled of spirits, and that he understood the cause of\r\nher excitement.\r\n\r\n"Try and be calm," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why should I be calm?" she began, quickly, flushing scarlet. "I am a\r\nconvict, and you are a gentleman and a prince. There\'s no need for you\r\nto soil yourself by touching me. You go to your princesses; my price is\r\na ten-rouble note."\r\n\r\n"However cruelly you may speak, you cannot express what I myself am\r\nfeeling," he said, trembling all over; "you cannot imagine to what\r\nextent I feel myself guilty towards you."\r\n\r\n"Feel yourself guilty?" she said, angrily mimicking him. "You did not\r\nfeel so then, but threw me 100 roubles. That\'s your price."\r\n\r\n"I know, I know; but what is to be done now?" said Nekhludoff. "I have\r\ndecided not to leave you, and what I have said I shall do."\r\n\r\n"And I say you sha\'n\'t," she said, and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n"Katusha," he said, touching her hand.\r\n\r\n"You go away. I am a convict and you a prince, and you\'ve no business\r\nhere," she cried, pulling away her hand, her whole appearance\r\ntransformed by her wrath. "You\'ve got pleasure out of me in this life,\r\nand want to save yourself through me in the life to come. You are\r\ndisgusting to me--your spectacles and the whole of your dirty fat mug.\r\nGo, go!" she screamed, starting to her feet.\r\n\r\nThe jailer came up to them.\r\n\r\n"What are you kicking up this row for?\' That won\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Let her alone, please," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"She must not forget herself," said the jailer. "Please wait a little,"\r\nsaid Nekhludoff, and the jailer returned to the window.\r\n\r\nMaslova sat down again, dropping her eyes and firmly clasping her small\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stooped over her, not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\n"You do not believe me?" he said.\r\n\r\n"That you mean to marry me? It will never be. I\'ll rather hang myself.\r\nSo there!"\r\n\r\n"Well, still I shall go on serving you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s your affair, only I don\'t want anything from you. I am telling\r\nyou the plain truth," she said. "Oh, why did I not die then?" she added,\r\nand began to cry piteously.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff could not speak; her tears infected him.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes, looked at him in surprise, and began to wipe her\r\ntears with her kerchief.\r\n\r\nThe jailer came up again and reminded them that it was time to part.\r\n\r\nMaslova rose.\r\n\r\n"You are excited. If it is possible, I shall come again tomorrow; you\r\nthink it over," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nShe gave him no answer and, without looking up, followed the jailer out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n"Well, lass, you\'ll have rare times now," Korableva said, when Maslova\r\nreturned to the cell. "Seems he\'s mighty sweet on you; make the most\r\nof it while he\'s after you. He\'ll help you out. Rich people can do\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s so," remarked the watchman\'s wife, with her musical voice.\r\n"When a poor man thinks of getting married, there\'s many a slip \'twixt\r\nthe cup and the lip; but a rich man need only make up his mind and it\'s\r\ndone. We knew a toff like that duckie. What d\'you think he did?"\r\n\r\n"Well, have you spoken about my affairs?" the old woman asked.\r\n\r\nBut Maslova gave her fellow-prisoners no answer; she lay down on the\r\nshelf bedstead, her squinting eyes fixed on a corner of the room, and\r\nlay there until the evening.\r\n\r\nA painful struggle went on in her soul. What Nekhludoff had told her\r\ncalled up the memory of that world in which she had suffered and which\r\nshe had left without having understood, hating it. She now feared to\r\nwake from the trance in which she was living. Not having arrived at any\r\nconclusion when evening came, she again bought some vodka and drank with\r\nher companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nVERA DOUKHOVA.\r\n\r\n"So this is what it means, this," thought Nekhludoff as he left the\r\nprison, only now fully understanding his crime. If he had not tried to\r\nexpiate his guilt he would never have found out how great his crime was.\r\nNor was this all; she, too, would never have felt the whole horror of\r\nwhat had been done to her. He only now saw what he had done to the soul\r\nof this woman; only now she saw and understood what had been done to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Nekhludoff had played with a sensation of\r\nself-admiration, had admired his own remorse; now he was simply filled\r\nwith horror. He knew he could not throw her up now, and yet he could not\r\nimagine what would come of their relations to one another.\r\n\r\nJust as he was going out, a jailer, with a disagreeable, insinuating\r\ncountenance, and a cross and medals on his breast, came up and handed\r\nhim a note with an air of mystery.\r\n\r\n"Here is a note from a certain person, your honour," he said to\r\nNekhludoff as he gave him the envelope.\r\n\r\n"What person?"\r\n\r\n"You will know when you read it. A political prisoner. I am in that\r\nward, so she asked me; and though it is against the rules, still\r\nfeelings of humanity--" The jailer spoke in an unnatural manner.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was surprised that a jailer of the ward where political\r\nprisoners were kept should pass notes inside the very prison walls, and\r\nalmost within sight of every one; he did not then know that this was\r\nboth a jailer and a spy. However, he took the note and read it on coming\r\nout of the prison.\r\n\r\nThe note was written in a bold hand, and ran as follows: "Having heard\r\nthat you visit the prison, and are interested in the case of a criminal\r\nprisoner, the desire of seeing you arose in me. Ask for a permission\r\nto see me. I can give you a good deal of information concerning your\r\nprotegee, and also our group.--Yours gratefully, VERA DOUKHOVA."\r\n\r\nVera Doukhova had been a school-teacher in an out-of-the-way village of\r\nthe Novgorod Government, where Nekhludoff and some friends of his had\r\nonce put up while bear hunting. Nekhludoff gladly and vividly recalled\r\nthose old days, and his acquaintance with Doukhova. It was just before\r\nLent, in an isolated spot, 40 miles from the railway. The hunt had\r\nbeen successful; two bears had been killed; and the company were having\r\ndinner before starting on their return journey, when the master of the\r\nhut where they were putting up came in to say that the deacon\'s daughter\r\nwanted to speak to Prince Nekhludoff. "Is she pretty?" some one asked.\r\n"None of that, please," Nekhludoff said, and rose with a serious look\r\non his face. Wiping his mouth, and wondering what the deacon\'s daughter\r\nmight want of him, he went into the host\'s private hut.\r\n\r\nThere he found a girl with a felt hat and a warm cloak on--a sinewy,\r\nugly girl; only her eyes with their arched brows were beautiful.\r\n\r\n"Here, miss, speak to him," said the old housewife; "this is the prince\r\nhimself. I shall go out meanwhile."\r\n\r\n"In what way can I be of service to you?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"I--I--I see you are throwing away your money on such nonsense--on\r\nhunting," began the girl, in great confusion. "I know--I only want one\r\nthing--to be of use to the people, and I can do nothing because I know\r\nnothing--" Her eyes were so truthful, so kind, and her expression of\r\nresoluteness and yet bashfulness was so touching, that Nekhludoff, as\r\nit often happened to him, suddenly felt as if he were in her position,\r\nunderstood, and sympathised.\r\n\r\n"What can I do, then?"\r\n\r\n"I am a teacher, but should like to follow a course of study; and I\r\nam not allowed to do so. That is, not that I am not allowed to; they\'d\r\nallow me to, but I have not got the means. Give them to me, and when I\r\nhave finished the course I shall repay you. I am thinking the rich kill\r\nbears and give the peasants drink; all this is bad. Why should they not\r\ndo good? I only want 80 roubles. But if you don\'t wish to, never mind,"\r\nshe added, gravely.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I am very grateful to you for this opportunity. . . .\r\nI will bring it at once," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nHe went out into the passage, and there met one of his comrades, who\r\nhad been overhearing his conversation. Paying no heed to his chaffing,\r\nNekhludoff got the money out of his bag and took it to her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, do not thank me; it is I who should thank you," he said.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to remember all this now; pleasant to remember that\r\nhe had nearly had a quarrel with an officer who tried to make an\r\nobjectionable joke of it, and how another of his comrades had taken his\r\npart, which led to a closer friendship between them. How successful the\r\nwhole of that hunting expedition had been, and how happy he had felt\r\nwhen returning to the railway station that night. The line of sledges,\r\nthe horses in tandem, glide quickly along the narrow road that lies\r\nthrough the forest, now between high trees, now between low firs weighed\r\ndown by the snow, caked in heavy lumps on their branches. A red light\r\nflashes in the dark, some one lights an aromatic cigarette. Joseph, a\r\nbear driver, keeps running from sledge to sledge, up to his knees in\r\nsnow, and while putting things to rights he speaks about the elk which\r\nare now going about on the deep snow and gnawing the bark off the aspen\r\ntrees, of the bears that are lying asleep in their deep hidden dens, and\r\nhis breath comes warm through the opening in the sledge cover. All this\r\ncame back to Nekhludoff\'s mind; but, above all, the joyous sense of\r\nhealth, strength, and freedom from care: the lungs breathing in the\r\nfrosty air so deeply that the fur cloak is drawn tightly on his chest,\r\nthe fine snow drops off the low branches on to his face, his body\r\nis warm, his face feels fresh, and his soul is free from care,\r\nself-reproach, fear, or desire. How beautiful it was. And now, O God!\r\nwhat torment, what trouble!\r\n\r\nEvidently Vera Doukhova was a revolutionist and imprisoned as such. He\r\nmust see her, especially as she promised to advise him how to lighten\r\nMaslova\'s lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE VICE-GOVERNOR OF THE PRISON.\r\n\r\nAwaking early the next morning, Nekhludoff remembered what he had done\r\nthe day before, and was seized with fear.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this fear, he was more determined than ever to continue\r\nwhat he had begun.\r\n\r\nConscious of a sense of duty, he left the house and went to see\r\nMaslennikoff in order to obtain from him a permission to visit Maslova\r\nin prison, and also the Menshoffs--mother and son--about whom Maslova\r\nhad spoken to him. Nekhludoff had known this Maslennikoff a long time;\r\nthey had been in the regiment together. At that time Maslennikoff was\r\ntreasurer to the regiment.\r\n\r\nHe was a kind-hearted and zealous officer, knowing and wishing to know\r\nnothing beyond the regiment and the Imperial family. Now Nekhludoff\r\nsaw him as an administrator, who had exchanged the regiment for an\r\nadministrative office in the government where he lived. He was married\r\nto a rich and energetic woman, who had forced him to exchange military\r\nfor civil service. She laughed at him, and caressed him, as if he were\r\nher own pet animal. Nekhludoff had been to see them once during the\r\nwinter, but the couple were so uninteresting to him that he had not gone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of Nekhludoff Maslennikoff\'s face beamed all over. He had\r\nthe same fat red face, and was as corpulent and as well dressed as in\r\nhis military days. Then, he used to be always dressed in a well-brushed\r\nuniform, made according to the latest fashion, tightly fitting his chest\r\nand shoulders; now, it was a civil service uniform he wore, and that,\r\ntoo, tightly fitted his well-fed body and showed off his broad chest,\r\nand was cut according to the latest fashion. In spite of the difference\r\nin age (Maslennikoff was 40), the two men were very familiar with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n"Halloo, old fellow! How good of you to come! Let us go and see my wife.\r\nI have just ten minutes to spare before the meeting. My chief is away,\r\nyou know. I am at the head of the Government administration," he said,\r\nunable to disguise his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"I have come on business."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said Maslennikoff, in an anxious and severe tone, putting\r\nhimself at once on his guard.\r\n\r\n"There is a person, whom I am very much interested in, in prison" (at\r\nthe word "prison" Maslennikoff\'s face grew stern); "and I should like to\r\nhave an interview in the office, and not in the common visiting-room. I\r\nhave been told it depended on you."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, mon cher," said Maslennikoff, putting both hands on\r\nNekhludoff\'s knees, as if to tone down his grandeur; "but remember, I am\r\nmonarch only for an hour."\r\n\r\n"Then will you give me an order that will enable me to see her?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a woman?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What is she there for?"\r\n\r\n"Poisoning, but she has been unjustly condemned."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there you have it, your justice administered by jury, ils n\'en\r\nfont point d\'autres," he said, for some unknown reason, in French. "I\r\nknow you do not agree with me, but it can\'t be helped, c\'est mon opinion\r\nbien arretee," he added, giving utterance to an opinion he had for the\r\nlast twelve months been reading in the retrograde Conservative paper. "I\r\nknow you are a Liberal."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether I am a Liberal or something else," Nekhludoff\r\nsaid, smiling; it always surprised him to find himself ranked with a\r\npolitical party and called a Liberal, when he maintained that a man\r\nshould be heard before he was judged, that before being tried all men\r\nwere equal, that nobody at all ought to be ill-treated and beaten, but\r\nespecially those who had not yet been condemned by law. "I don\'t know\r\nwhether I am a Liberal or not; but I do know that however had the\r\npresent way of conducting a trial is, it is better than the old."\r\n\r\n"And whom have you for an advocate?"\r\n\r\n"I have spoken to Fanarin."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Fanarin!" said Meslennikoff, with a grimace, recollecting how\r\nthis Fanarin had examined him as a witness at a trial the year before\r\nand had, in the politest manner, held him up to ridicule for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n"I should not advise you to have anything to do with him. _Fanarin est\r\nun homme tare_."\r\n\r\n"I have one more request to make," said Nekhludoff, without answering\r\nhim. "There\'s a girl whom I knew long ago, a teacher; she is a very\r\npitiable little thing, and is now also imprisoned, and would like to see\r\nme. Could you give me a permission to visit her?"\r\n\r\nMeslennikoff bent his head on one side and considered.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a political one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have been told so."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, only relatives get permission to visit political\r\nprisoners. Still, I\'ll give you an open order. _Je sais que vous\r\nn\'abuserez pas_. What\'s the name of your protegee? Doukhova? _Elle est\r\njolie?_"\r\n\r\n"Hideuse."\r\n\r\nMaslennikoff shook his head disapprovingly, went up to the table, and\r\nwrote on a sheet of paper, with a printed heading: "The bearer, Prince\r\nDmitri Ivanovitch Nekhludoff, is to be allowed to interview in the\r\nprison office the meschanka Maslova, and also the medical assistant,\r\nDoukhova," and he finished with an elaborate flourish.\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ll be able to see what order we have got there. And it is\r\nvery difficult to keep order, it is so crowded, especially with people\r\ncondemned to exile; but I watch strictly, and love the work. You will\r\nsee they are very comfortable and contented. But one must know\r\nhow to deal with them. Only a few days ago we had a little\r\ntrouble--insubordination; another would have called it mutiny, and would\r\nhave made many miserable, but with us it all passed quietly. We must\r\nhave solicitude on one hand, firmness and power on the other," and he\r\nclenched the fat, white, turquoise-ringed fist, which issued out of\r\nthe starched cuff of his shirt sleeve, fastened with a gold stud.\r\n"Solicitude and firm power."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know about that," said Nekhludoff. "I went there twice,\r\nand felt very much depressed."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, you ought to get acquainted with the Countess Passek,"\r\ncontinued Maslennikoff, growing talkative. "She has given herself up\r\nentirely to this sort of work. Elle fait beaucoup de bien. Thanks to\r\nher--and, perhaps I may add without false modesty, to me--everything has\r\nbeen changed, changed in such a way that the former horrors no longer\r\nexist, and they are really quite comfortable there. Well, you\'ll see.\r\nThere\'s Fanarin. I do not know him personally; besides, my social\r\nposition keeps our ways apart; but he is positively a bad man, and\r\nbesides, he takes the liberty of saying such things in the court--such\r\nthings!"\r\n\r\n"Well, thank you," Nekhludoff said, taking the paper, and without\r\nlistening further he bade good-day to his former comrade.\r\n\r\n"And won\'t you go in to see my wife?"\r\n\r\n"No, pray excuse me; I have no time now."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, why she will never forgive me," said Maslennikoff,\r\naccompanying his old acquaintance down to the first landing, as he was\r\nin the habit of doing to persons of not the greatest, but the second\r\ngreatest importance, with whom he classed Nekhludoff; "now do go in, if\r\nonly for a moment."\r\n\r\nBut Nekhludoff remained firm; and while the footman and the door-keeper\r\nrushed to give him his stick and overcoat, and opened the door, outside\r\nof which there stood a policeman, Nekhludoff repeated that he really\r\ncould not come in.\r\n\r\n"Well, then; on Thursday, please. It is her \'at-home.\' I will tell her\r\nyou will come," shouted Maslennikoff from the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE CELLS.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff drove that day straight from Maslennikoff\'s to the prison,\r\nand went to the inspector\'s lodging, which he now knew. He was again\r\nstruck by the sounds of the same piano of inferior quality; but this\r\ntime it was not a rhapsody that was being played, but exercises by\r\nClementi, again with the same vigour, distinctness, and quickness. The\r\nservant with the bandaged eye said the inspector was in, and showed\r\nNekhludoff to a small drawing-room, in which there stood a sofa and,\r\nin front of it, a table, with a large lamp, which stood on a piece of\r\ncrochet work, and the paper shade of which was burnt on one side. The\r\nchief inspector entered, with his usual sad and weary look.\r\n\r\n"Take a seat, please. What is it you want?" he said, buttoning up the\r\nmiddle button of his uniform.\r\n\r\n"I have just been to the vice-governor\'s, and got this order from him. I\r\nshould like to see the prisoner Maslova."\r\n\r\n"Markova?" asked the inspector, unable to bear distinctly because of the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n"Maslova!"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes." The inspector got up and went to the door whence proceeded\r\nClementi\'s roulades.\r\n\r\n"Mary, can\'t you stop just a minute?" he said, in a voice that showed\r\nthat this music was the bane of his life. "One can\'t hear a word."\r\n\r\nThe piano was silent, but one could hear the sound of reluctant steps,\r\nand some one looked in at the door.\r\n\r\nThe inspector seemed to feel eased by the interval of silence, lit a\r\nthick cigarette of weak tobacco, and offered one to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff refused.\r\n\r\n"What I want is to see Maslova."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, that can be managed. Now, then, what do you want?" he said,\r\naddressing a little girl of five or six, who came into the room and\r\nwalked up to her father with her head turned towards Nekhludoff, and her\r\neyes fixed on him.\r\n\r\n"There, now, you\'ll fall down," said the inspector, smiling, as the\r\nlittle girl ran up to him, and, not looking where she was going, caught\r\nher foot in a little rug.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if I may, I shall go."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very convenient to see Maslova to-day," said the inspector.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know, it\'s all your own fault," said the inspector, with a\r\nslight smile. "Prince, give her no money into her hands. If you like,\r\ngive it me. I will keep it for her. You see, you gave her some money\r\nyesterday; she got some spirits (it\'s an evil we cannot manage to root\r\nout), and to-day she is quite tipsy, even violent."\r\n\r\n"Can this be true?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, it is. I have even been obliged to have recourse to severe\r\nmeasures, and to put her into a separate cell. She is a quiet woman in\r\nan ordinary way. But please do not give her any money. These people are\r\nso--" What had happened the day before came vividly back to Nekhludoff\'s\r\nmind, and again he was seized with fear.\r\n\r\n"And Doukhova, a political prisoner; might I see her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you like," said the inspector. He embraced the little girl,\r\nwho was still looking at Nekhludoff, got up, and, tenderly motioning\r\nher aside, went into the ante-room. Hardly had he got into the overcoat\r\nwhich the maid helped him to put on, and before he had reached the door,\r\nthe distinct sounds of Clementi\'s roulades again began.\r\n\r\n"She entered the Conservatoire, but there is such disorder there. She\r\nhas a great gift," said the inspector, as they went down the stairs.\r\n"She means to play at concerts."\r\n\r\nThe inspector and Nekhludoff arrived at the prison. The gates were\r\ninstantly opened as they appeared. The jailers, with their fingers\r\nlifted to their caps, followed the inspector with their eyes. Four\r\nmen, with their heads half shaved, who were carrying tubs filled with\r\nsomething, cringed when they saw the inspector. One of them frowned\r\nangrily, his black eyes glaring.\r\n\r\n"Of course a talent like that must be developed; it would not do to bury\r\nit, but in a small lodging, you know, it is rather hard." The inspector\r\nwent on with the conversation, taking no notice of the prisoners.\r\n\r\n"Who is it you want to see?"\r\n\r\n"Doukhova."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s in the tower. You\'ll have to wait a little," he said.\r\n\r\n"Might I not meanwhile see the prisoners Menshoff, mother and son, who\r\nare accused of incendiarism?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Cell No. 21. Yes, they can be sent for."\r\n\r\n"But might I not see Menshoff in his cell?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll find the waiting-room more pleasant."\r\n\r\n"No. I should prefer the cell. It is more interesting."\r\n\r\n"Well, you have found something to be interested in!"\r\n\r\nHere the assistant, a smartly-dressed officer, entered the side door.\r\n\r\n"Here, see the Prince into Menshoff\'s cell, No. 21," said the inspector\r\nto his assistant, "and then take him to the office. And I\'ll go and\r\ncall--What\'s her name? Vera Doukhova."\r\n\r\nThe inspector\'s assistant was young, with dyed moustaches, and diffusing\r\nthe smell of eau-de-cologne. "This way, please," he said to Nekhludoff,\r\nwith a pleasant smile. "Our establishment interests you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it does interest me; and, besides, I look upon it as a duty to\r\nhelp a man who I heard was confined here, though innocent."\r\n\r\nThe assistant shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that may happen," he said quietly, politely stepping aside to let\r\nthe visitor enter, the stinking corridor first. "But it also happens\r\nthat they lie. Here we are."\r\n\r\nThe doors of the cells were open, and some of the prisoners were in the\r\ncorridor. The assistant nodded slightly to the jailers, and cast a side\r\nglance at the prisoners, who, keeping close to the wall, crept back to\r\ntheir cells, or stood like soldiers, with their arms at their sides,\r\nfollowing the official with their eyes. After passing through one\r\ncorridor, the assistant showed Nekhludoff into another to the left,\r\nseparated from the first by an iron door. This corridor was darker, and\r\nsmelt even worse than the first. The corridor had doors on both sides,\r\nwith little holes in them about an inch in diameter. There was only an\r\nold jailer, with an unpleasant face, in this corridor.\r\n\r\n"Where is Menshoff?" asked the inspector\'s assistant.\r\n\r\n"The eighth cell to the left."\r\n\r\n"And these? Are they occupied?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Yes, all but one."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nNO. 21.\r\n\r\n"May I look in?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," answered the assistant, smiling, and turned to the\r\njailer with some question.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked into one of the little holes, and saw a tall young man\r\npacing up and down the cell. When the man heard some one at the door he\r\nlooked up with a frown, but continued walking up and down.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked into another hole. His eye met another large eye\r\nlooking out of the hole at him, and he quickly stepped aside. In the\r\nthird cell he saw a very small man asleep on the bed, covered, head and\r\nall, with his prison cloak. In the fourth a broad-faced man was sitting\r\nwith his elbows on his knees and his head low down. At the sound of\r\nfootsteps this man raised his head and looked up. His face, especially\r\nhis large eyes, bore the expression of hopeless dejection. One could see\r\nthat it did not even interest him to know who was looking into his\r\ncell. Whoever it might be, he evidently hoped for nothing good from him.\r\nNekhludoff was seized with dread, and went to Menshoff\'s cell, No. 21,\r\nwithout stopping to look through any more holes. The jailer unlocked the\r\ndoor and opened it. A young man, with long neck, well-developed muscles,\r\na small head, and kind, round eyes, stood by the bed, hastily putting\r\non his cloak, and looking at the newcomers with a frightened face.\r\nNekhludoff was specially struck by the kind, round eyes that were\r\nthrowing frightened and inquiring glances in turns at him, at the\r\njailer, and at the assistant, and back again.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a gentleman wants to inquire into your affair."\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was told about you," Nekhludoff said, going through the cell up\r\nto the dirty grated window, "and I should like to hear all about it from\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nMenshoff also came up to the window, and at once started telling his\r\nstory, at first looking shyly at the inspector\'s assistant, but growing\r\ngradually bolder. When the assistant left the cell and went into the\r\ncorridor to give some order the man grew quite bold. The story was told\r\nwith the accent and in the manner common to a most ordinary good peasant\r\nlad. To hear it told by a prisoner dressed in this degrading clothing,\r\nand inside a prison, seemed very strange to Nekhludoff. Nekhludoff\r\nlistened, and at the same time kept looking around him--at the low\r\nbedstead with its straw mattress, the window and the dirty, damp wall,\r\nand the piteous face and form of this unfortunate, disfigured peasant\r\nin his prison cloak and shoes, and he felt sadder and sadder, and would\r\nhave liked not to believe what this good-natured fellow was saying. It\r\nseemed too dreadful to think that men could do such a thing as to take\r\na man, dress him in convict clothes, and put him in this horrible place\r\nwithout any reason only because he himself had been injured. And yet the\r\nthought that this seemingly true story, told with such a good-natured\r\nexpression on the face, might be an invention and a lie was still\r\nmore dreadful. This was the story: The village public-house keeper had\r\nenticed the young fellow\'s wife. He tried to get justice by all sorts\r\nof means. But everywhere the public-house keeper managed to bribe the\r\nofficials, and was acquitted. Once, he took his wife back by force, but\r\nshe ran away next day. Then he came to demand her back, but, though he\r\nsaw her when he came in, the public-house keeper told him she was not\r\nthere, and ordered him to go away. He would not go, so the public-house\r\nkeeper and his servant beat him so that they drew blood. The next day\r\na fire broke out in the public-house, and the young man and his mother\r\nwere accused of having set the house on fire. He had not set it on fire,\r\nbut was visiting a friend at the time.\r\n\r\n"And it is true that you did not set it on fire?"\r\n\r\n"It never entered my head to do it, sir. It must be my enemy that did\r\nit himself. They say he had only just insured it. Then they said it was\r\nmother and I that did it, and that we had threatened him. It is true I\r\nonce did go for him, my heart couldn\'t stand it any longer."\r\n\r\n"Can this be true?"\r\n\r\n"God is my witness it is true. Oh, sir, be so good--" and Nekhludoff had\r\nsome difficulty to prevent him from bowing down to the ground. "You see\r\nI am perishing without any reason." His face quivered and he turned\r\nup the sleeve of his cloak and began to cry, wiping the tears with the\r\nsleeve of his dirty shirt.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready?" asked the assistant.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well, cheer up. We will consult a good lawyer, and will do what we\r\ncan," said Nekhludoff, and went out. Menshoff stood close to the door,\r\nso that the jailer knocked him in shutting it, and while the jailer was\r\nlocking it he remained looking out through the little hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nVICTIMS OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nPassing back along the broad corridor (it was dinner time, and the cell\r\ndoors were open), among the men dressed in their light yellow cloaks,\r\nshort, wide trousers, and prison shoes, who were looking eagerly at him,\r\nNekhludoff felt a strange mixture of sympathy for them, and horror and\r\nperplexity at the conduct of those who put and kept them here, and,\r\nbesides, he felt, he knew not why, ashamed of himself calmly examining\r\nit all.\r\n\r\nIn one of the corridors, some one ran, clattering with his shoes, in\r\nat the door of a cell. Several men came out from here, and stood in\r\nNekhludoff\'s way, bowing to him.\r\n\r\n"Please, your honour (we don\'t know what to call you), get our affair\r\nsettled somehow."\r\n\r\n"I am not an official. I know nothing about it."\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, you come from outside; tell somebody--one of the\r\nauthorities, if need be," said an indignant voice. "Show some pity\r\non us, as a human being. Here we are suffering the second month for\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? Why?" said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Why? We ourselves don\'t know why, but are sitting here the second\r\nmonth."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s quite true, and it is owing to an accident," said the\r\ninspector. "These people were taken up because they had no passports,\r\nand ought to have been sent back to their native government; but the\r\nprison there is burnt, and the local authorities have written, asking us\r\nnot to send them on. So we have sent all the other passportless people\r\nto their different governments, but are keeping these."\r\n\r\n"What! For no other reason than that?" Nekhludoff exclaimed, stopping at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nA crowd of about forty men, all dressed in prison clothes, surrounded\r\nhim and the assistant, and several began talking at once. The assistant\r\nstopped them.\r\n\r\n"Let some one of you speak."\r\n\r\nA tall, good-looking peasant, a stone-mason, of about fifty, stepped out\r\nfrom the rest. He told Nekhludoff that all of them had been ordered back\r\nto their homes and were now being kept in prison because they had no\r\npassports, yet they had passports which were only a fortnight overdue.\r\nThe same thing had happened every year; they had many times omitted to\r\nrenew their passports till they were overdue, and nobody had ever said\r\nanything; but this year they had been taken up and were being kept in\r\nprison the second month, as if they were criminals.\r\n\r\n"We are all masons, and belong to the same artel. We are told that the\r\nprison in our government is burnt, but this is not our fault. Do help\r\nus."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff listened, but hardly understood what the good-looking old\r\nman was saying, because his attention was riveted to a large, dark-grey,\r\nmany-legged louse that was creeping along the good-looking man\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that? Is it possible for such a reason?" Nekhludoff said, turning\r\nto the assistant.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they should have been sent off and taken back to their homes,"\r\ncalmly said the assistant, "but they seem to have been forgotten or\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\nBefore the assistant had finished, a small, nervous man, also in prison\r\ndress, came out of the crowd, and, strangely contorting his mouth, began\r\nto say that they were being ill-used for nothing.\r\n\r\n"Worse than dogs," he began.\r\n\r\n"Now, now; not too much of this. Hold your tongue, or you know--"\r\n\r\n"What do I know?" screamed the little man, desperately. "What is our\r\ncrime?"\r\n\r\n"Silence!" shouted the assistant, and the little man was silent.\r\n\r\n"But what is the meaning of all this?" Nekhludoff thought to himself\r\nas he came out of the cell, while a hundred eyes were fixed upon him\r\nthrough the openings of the cell doors and from the prisoners that met\r\nhim, making him feel as if he were running the gauntlet.\r\n\r\n"Is it really possible that perfectly innocent people are kept here?"\r\nNekhludoff uttered when they left the corridor.\r\n\r\n"What would you have us do? They lie so. To hear them talk they are all\r\nof them innocent," said the inspector\'s assistant. "But it does happen\r\nthat some are really imprisoned for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Well, these have done nothing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must admit it. Still, the people are fearfully spoilt. There\r\nare such types--desperate fellows, with whom one has to look sharp.\r\nTo-day two of that sort had to be punished."\r\n\r\n"Punished? How?"\r\n\r\n"Flogged with a birch-rod, by order."\r\n\r\n"But corporal punishment is abolished."\r\n\r\n"Not for such as are deprived of their rights. They are still liable to\r\nit."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thought of what he had seen the day before while waiting\r\nin the hall, and now understood that the punishment was then being\r\ninflicted, and the mixed feeling of curiosity, depression, perplexity,\r\nand moral nausea, that grew into physical sickness, took hold of him\r\nmore strongly than ever before.\r\n\r\nWithout listening to the inspector\'s assistant, or looking round, he\r\nhurriedly left the corridor, and went to the office. The inspector was\r\nin the office, occupied with other business, and had forgotten to send\r\nfor Doukhova. He only remembered his promise to have her called when\r\nNekhludoff entered the office.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, please. I\'ll send for her at once," said the inspector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nPRISONERS AND FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nThe office consisted of two rooms. The first room, with a large,\r\ndilapidated stove and two dirty windows, had a black measure for\r\nmeasuring the prisoners in one corner, and in another corner hung a\r\nlarge image of Christ, as is usual in places where they torture people.\r\nIn this room stood several jailers. In the next room sat about twenty\r\npersons, men and women in groups and in pairs, talking in low voices.\r\nThere was a writing table by the window.\r\n\r\nThe inspector sat down by the table, and offered Nekhludoff a chair\r\nbeside him. Nekhludoff sat down, and looked at the people in the room.\r\n\r\nThe first who drew his attention was a young man with a pleasant face,\r\ndressed in a short jacket, standing in front of a middle-aged woman\r\nwith dark eyebrows, and he was eagerly telling her something and\r\ngesticulating with his hands. Beside them sat an old man, with blue\r\nspectacles, holding the hand of a young woman in prisoner\'s clothes, who\r\nwas telling him something. A schoolboy, with a fixed, frightened look on\r\nhis face, was gazing at the old man. In one corner sat a pair of\r\nlovers. She was quite young and pretty, and had short, fair hair, looked\r\nenergetic, and was elegantly dressed; he had fine features, wavy hair,\r\nand wore a rubber jacket. They sat in their corner and seemed stupefied\r\nwith love. Nearest to the table sat a grey-haired woman dressed in\r\nblack, evidently the mother of a young, consumptive-looking fellow, in\r\nthe same kind of jacket. Her head lay on his shoulder. She was trying\r\nto say something, but the tears prevented her from speaking; she began\r\nseveral times, but had to stop. The young man held a paper in his hand,\r\nand, apparently not knowing what to do, kept folding and pressing it\r\nwith an angry look on his face.\r\n\r\nBeside them was a short-haired, stout, rosy girl, with very prominent\r\neyes, dressed in a grey dress and a cape; she sat beside the weeping\r\nmother, tenderly stroking her. Everything about this girl was beautiful;\r\nher large, white hands, her short, wavy hair, her firm nose and lips,\r\nbut the chief charm of her face lay in her kind, truthful hazel eyes.\r\nThe beautiful eyes turned away from the mother for a moment when\r\nNekhludoff came in, and met his look. But she turned back at once and\r\nsaid something to the mother.\r\n\r\nNot far from the lovers a dark, dishevelled man, with a gloomy face, sat\r\nangrily talking to a beardless visitor, who looked as if he belonged to\r\nthe Scoptsy sect.\r\n\r\nAt the very door stood a young man in a rubber jacket, who seemed more\r\nconcerned about the impression he produced on the onlooker than about\r\nwhat he was saying. Nekhludoff, sitting by the inspector\'s side, looked\r\nround with strained curiosity. A little boy with closely-cropped hair\r\ncame up to him and addressed him in a thin little voice.\r\n\r\n"And whom are you waiting for?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was surprised at the question, but looking at the boy, and\r\nseeing the serious little face with its bright, attentive eyes fixed\r\non him, answered him seriously that he was waiting for a woman of his\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n"Is she, then, your sister?" the boy asked.\r\n\r\n"No, not my sister," Nekhludoff answered in surprise.\r\n\r\n"And with whom are you here?" he inquired of the boy.\r\n\r\n"I? With mamma; she is a political one," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Mary Pavlovna, take Kolia!" said the inspector, evidently considering\r\nNekhludoff\'s conversation with the boy illegal.\r\n\r\nMary Pavlovna, the beautiful girl who had attracted Nekhludoff\'s\r\nattention, rose tall and erect, and with firm, almost manly steps,\r\napproached Nekhludoff and the boy.\r\n\r\n"What is he asking you? Who you are?" she inquired with a slight smile,\r\nand looking straight into his face with a trustful look in her kind,\r\nprominent eyes, and as simply as if there could be no doubt whatever\r\nthat she was and must be on sisterly terms with everybody.\r\n\r\n"He likes to know everything," she said, looking at the boy with so\r\nsweet and kind a smile that both the boy and Nekhludoff were obliged to\r\nsmile back.\r\n\r\n"He was asking me whom I have come to see."\r\n\r\n"Mary Pavlovna, it is against the rules to speak to strangers. You know\r\nit is," said the inspector.\r\n\r\n"All right, all right," she said, and went back to the consumptive lad\'s\r\nmother, holding Kolia\'s little hand in her large, white one, while he\r\ncontinued gazing up into her face.\r\n\r\n"Whose is this little boy?" Nekhludoff asked of the inspector.\r\n\r\n"His mother is a political prisoner, and he was born in prison,"\r\nsaid the inspector, in a pleased tone, as if glad to point out how\r\nexceptional his establishment was.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and now he is going to Siberia with her."\r\n\r\n"And that young girl?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer your question," said the inspector, shrugging his\r\nshoulders. "Besides, here is Doukhova."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nVERA DOUKHOVA EXPLAINS.\r\n\r\nThrough a door, at the back of the room, entered, with a wriggling gait,\r\nthe thin, yellow Vera Doukhova, with her large, kind eyes.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for having come," she said, pressing Nekhludoff\'s hand. "Do you\r\nremember me? Let us sit down."\r\n\r\n"I did not expect to see you like this."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am very happy. It is so delightful, so delightful, that I desire\r\nnothing better," said Vera Doukhova, with the usual expression of fright\r\nin the large, kind, round eyes fixed on Nekhludoff, and twisting the\r\nterribly thin, sinewy neck, surrounded by the shabby, crumpled, dirty\r\ncollar of her bodice. Nekhludoff asked her how she came to be in prison.\r\n\r\nIn answer she began relating all about her affairs with great animation.\r\nHer speech was intermingled with a great many long words, such as\r\npropaganda, disorganisation, social groups, sections and sub-sections,\r\nabout which she seemed to think everybody knew, but which Nekhludoff had\r\nnever heard of.\r\n\r\nShe told him all the secrets of the Nardovolstvo, [literally, "People\'s\r\nFreedom," a revolutionary movement] evidently convinced that he was\r\npleased to hear them. Nekhludoff looked at her miserable little neck,\r\nher thin, unkempt hair, and wondered why she had been doing all these\r\nstrange things, and why she was now telling all this to him. He pitied\r\nher, but not as he had pitied Menshoff, the peasant, kept for no fault\r\nof his own in the stinking prison. She was pitiable because of the\r\nconfusion that filled her mind. It was clear that she considered herself\r\na heroine, and was ready to give her life for a cause, though she could\r\nhardly have explained what that cause was and in what its success would\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nThe business that Vera Doukhova wanted to see Nekhludoff about was\r\nthe following: A friend of hers, who had not even belonged to their\r\n"sub-group," as she expressed it, had been arrested with her about five\r\nmonths before, and imprisoned in the Petropavlovsky fortress because\r\nsome prohibited books and papers (which she had been asked to keep) had\r\nbeen found in her possession. Vera Doukhova felt herself in some measure\r\nto blame for her friend\'s arrest, and implored Nekhludoff, who had\r\nconnections among influential people, to do all he could in order to set\r\nthis friend free.\r\n\r\nBesides this, Doukhova asked him to try and get permission for\r\nanother friend of hers, Gourkevitch (who was also imprisoned in the\r\nPetropavlovsky fortress), to see his parents, and to procure some\r\nscientific books which he required for his studies. Nekhludoff promised\r\nto do what he could when he went to Petersburg.\r\n\r\nAs to her own story, this is what she said: Having finished a course\r\nof midwifery, she became connected with a group of adherents to the\r\nNardovolstvo, and made up her mind to agitate in the revolutionary\r\nmovement. At first all went on smoothly. She wrote proclamations\r\nand occupied herself with propaganda work in the factories; then, an\r\nimportant member having been arrested, their papers were seized and all\r\nconcerned were arrested. "I was also arrested, and shall be exiled. But\r\nwhat does it matter? I feel perfectly happy." She concluded her story\r\nwith a piteous smile.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff made some inquiries concerning the girl with the prominent\r\neyes. Vera Doukhova told him that this girl was the daughter of a\r\ngeneral, and had been long attached to the revolutionary party, and was\r\narrested because she had pleaded guilty to having shot a gendarme.\r\nShe lived in a house with some conspirators, where they had a secret\r\nprinting press. One night, when the police came to search this house,\r\nthe occupiers resolved to defend themselves, put out the light, and\r\nbegan destroying the things that might incriminate them. The police\r\nforced their way in, and one of the conspirators fired, and mortally\r\nwounded a gendarme. When an inquiry was instituted, this girl said that\r\nit was she who had fired, although she had never had a revolver in her\r\nhands, and would not have hurt a fly. And she kept to it, and was now\r\ncondemned to penal servitude in Siberia.\r\n\r\n"An altruistic, fine character," said Vera Doukhova, approvingly.\r\n\r\nThe third business that Vera Doukhova wanted to talk about concerned\r\nMaslova. She knew, as everybody does know in prison, the story of\r\nMaslova\'s life and his connection with her, and advised him to take\r\nsteps to get her removed into the political prisoner\'s ward, or into\r\nthe hospital to help to nurse the sick, of which there were very many at\r\nthat time, so that extra nurses were needed.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thanked her for the advice, and said he would try to act upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF AND THE PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the inspector, who said that the\r\ntime was up, and the prisoners and their friends must part. Nekhludoff\r\ntook leave of Vera Doukhova and went to the door, where he stopped to\r\nwatch what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe inspector\'s order called forth only heightened animation among the\r\nprisoners in the room, but no one seemed to think of going. Some rose\r\nand continued to talk standing, some went on talking without rising.\r\nA few began crying and taking leave of each other. The mother and\r\nher consumptive son seemed especially pathetic. The young fellow kept\r\ntwisting his bit of paper and his face seemed angry, so great were his\r\nefforts not to be infected by his mother\'s emotion. The mother, hearing\r\nthat it was time to part, put her head on his shoulder and sobbed and\r\nsniffed aloud.\r\n\r\nThe girl with the prominent eyes--Nekhludoff could not help watching\r\nher--was standing opposite the sobbing mother, and was saying something\r\nto her in a soothing tone. The old man with the blue spectacles stood\r\nholding his daughter\'s hand and nodding in answer to what she said. The\r\nyoung lovers rose, and, holding each other\'s hands, looked silently into\r\none another\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"These are the only two who are merry," said a young man with a short\r\ncoat who stood by Nekhludoff\'s side, also looking at those who were\r\nabout to part, and pointed to the lovers. Feeling Nekhludoff\'s and\r\nthe young man\'s eyes fixed on them, the lovers--the young man with the\r\nrubber coat and the pretty girl--stretched out their arms, and with\r\ntheir hands clasped in each other\'s, danced round and round again.\r\n"To-night they are going to be married here in prison, and she will\r\nfollow him to Siberia," said the young man.\r\n\r\n"What is he?"\r\n\r\n"A convict, condemned to penal servitude. Let those two at least have a\r\nlittle joy, or else it is too painful," the young man added, listening\r\nto the sobs of the consumptive lad\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"Now, my good people! Please, please do not oblige me to have recourse\r\nto severe measures," the inspector said, repeating the same words\r\nseveral times over. "Do, please," he went on in a weak, hesitating\r\nmanner. "It is high time. What do you mean by it? This sort of thing is\r\nquite impossible. I am now asking you for the last time," he repeated\r\nwearily, now putting out his cigarette and then lighting another.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that, artful, old, and common as were the devices\r\nenabling men to do evil to others without feeling responsible for it,\r\nthe inspector could not but feel conscious that he was one of those who\r\nwere guilty of causing the sorrow which manifested itself in this\r\nroom. And it was apparent that this troubled him sorely. At length the\r\nprisoners and their visitors began to go--the first out of the inner,\r\nthe latter out of the outer door. The man with the rubber jacket passed\r\nout among them, and the consumptive youth and the dishevelled man. Mary\r\nPavlovna went out with the boy born in prison.\r\n\r\nThe visitors went out too. The old man with the blue spectacles,\r\nstepping heavily, went out, followed by Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a strange state of things this," said the talkative young man, as\r\nif continuing an interrupted conversation, as he descended the stairs\r\nside by side with Nekhludoff. "Yet we have reason to be grateful to the\r\ninspector who does not keep strictly to the rules, kind-hearted fellow.\r\nIf they can get a talk it does relieve their hearts a bit, after all!"\r\n\r\nWhile talking to the young man, who introduced himself as Medinzeff,\r\nNekhludoff reached the hall. There the inspector came up to them with\r\nweary step.\r\n\r\n"If you wish to see Maslova," he said, apparently desiring to be polite\r\nto Nekhludoff, "please come to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Very well," answered Nekhludoff, and hurried away, experiencing\r\nmore than ever that sensation of moral nausea which he always felt on\r\nentering the prison.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the evidently innocent Menshoff seemed terrible, and\r\nnot so much his physical suffering as the perplexity, the distrust in\r\nthe good and in God which he must feel, seeing the cruelty of the people\r\nwho tormented him without any reason.\r\n\r\nTerrible were the disgrace and sufferings cast on these hundreds of\r\nguiltless people simply because something was not written on paper as it\r\nshould have been. Terrible were the brutalised jailers, whose occupation\r\nis to torment their brothers, and who were certain that they were\r\nfulfilling an important and useful duty; but most terrible of all seemed\r\nthis sickly, elderly, kind-hearted inspector, who was obliged to part\r\nmother and son, father and daughter, who were just the same sort of\r\npeople as he and his own children.\r\n\r\n"What is it all for?" Nekhludoff asked himself, and could not find an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nTHE VICE-GOVERNOR\'S "AT-HOME".\r\n\r\nThe next day Nekhludoff went to see the advocate, and spoke to him\r\nabout the Menshoffs\' case, begging him to undertake their defence. The\r\nadvocate promised to look into the case, and if it turned out to be as\r\nNekhludoff said he would in all probability undertake the defence free\r\nof charge. Then Nekhludoff told him of the 130 men who were kept in\r\nprison owing to a mistake. "On whom did it depend? Whose fault was it?"\r\n\r\nThe advocate was silent for a moment, evidently anxious to give a\r\ncorrect reply.\r\n\r\n"Whose fault is it? No one\'s," he said, decidedly. "Ask the Procureur,\r\nhe\'ll say it is the Governor\'s; ask the Governor, he\'ll say it is the\r\nProcureur\'s fault. No one is in fault."\r\n\r\n"I am just going to see the Vice-Governor. I shall tell him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s quite useless," said the advocate, with a smile. "He is such\r\na--he is not a relation or friend of yours?--such a blockhead, if I may\r\nsay so, and yet a crafty animal at the same time."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff remembered what Maslennikoff had said about the advocate, and\r\ndid not answer, but took leave and went on to Maslennikoff\'s. He had\r\nto ask Maslennikoff two things: about Maslova\'s removal to the prison\r\nhospital, and about the 130 passportless men innocently imprisoned.\r\nThough it was very hard to petition a man whom he did not respect, and\r\nby whose orders men were flogged, yet it was the only means of gaining\r\nhis end, and he had to go through with it.\r\n\r\nAs he drove up to Maslennikoff\'s house Nekhludoff saw a number of\r\ndifferent carriages by the front door, and remembered that it was\r\nMaslennikoff\'s wife\'s "at-home" day, to which he had been invited. At\r\nthe moment Nekhludoff drove up there was a carriage in front of the\r\ndoor, and a footman in livery, with a cockade in his hat, was helping\r\na lady down the doorstep. She was holding up her train, and showing her\r\nthin ankles, black stockings, and slippered feet. Among the carriages\r\nwas a closed landau, which he knew to be the Korchagins\'.\r\n\r\nThe grey-haired, red-checked coachman took off his hat and bowed in a\r\nrespectful yet friendly manner to Nekhludoff, as to a gentleman he knew\r\nwell. Nekhludoff had not had time to inquire for Maslennikoff, when the\r\nlatter appeared on the carpeted stairs, accompanying a very important\r\nguest not only to the first landing but to the bottom of the stairs.\r\nThis very important visitor, a military man, was speaking in French\r\nabout a lottery for the benefit of children\'s homes that were to be\r\nfounded in the city, and expressed the opinion that this was a good\r\noccupation for the ladies. "It amuses them, and the money comes."\r\n\r\n_"Qu\'elles s\'amusent et que le bon dieu les benisse. M. Nekhludoff!_ How\r\nd\'you do? How is it one never sees you?" he greeted Nekhludoff. "_Allez\r\npresenter vos devoirs a Madame._ And the Korchagins are here et Nadine\r\nBukshevden. _Toutes les jolies femmes de la ville,_" said the important\r\nguest, slightly raising his uniformed shoulders as he presented them to\r\nhis own richly liveried servant to have his military overcoat put on.\r\n"_Au revoir, mon cher._" And he pressed Maslennikoff\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Now, come up; I am so glad," said Maslennikoff, grasping Nekhludoff\'s\r\nhand. In spite of his corpulency Maslennikoff hurried quickly up the\r\nstairs. He was in particularly good spirits, owing to the attention paid\r\nhim by the important personage. Every such attention gave him the same\r\nsense of delight as is felt by an affectionate dog when its master pats\r\nit, strokes it, or scratches its ears. It wags its tail, cringes,\r\njumps about, presses its ears down, and madly rushes about in a circle.\r\nMaslennikoff was ready to do the same. He did not notice the serious\r\nexpression on Nekhludoff\'s face, paid no heed to his words, but pulled\r\nhim irresistibly towards the drawing-room, so that it was impossible for\r\nNekhludoff not to follow. "Business after wards. I shall do whatever\r\nyou want," said Meslennikoff, as he drew Nekhludoff through the dancing\r\nhall. "Announce Prince Nekhludoff," he said to a footman, without\r\nstopping on his way. The footman started off at a trot and passed them.\r\n\r\n"_Vous n\'avez qu\' a ordonner._ But you must see my wife. As it is, I got\r\nit for letting you go without seeing her last time."\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the drawing-room the footman had already\r\nannounced Nekhludoff, and from between the bonnets and heads that\r\nsurrounded it the smiling face of Anna Ignatievna, the Vice-Governor\'s\r\nwife, beamed on Nekhludoff. At the other end of the drawing-room several\r\nladies were seated round the tea-table, and some military men and some\r\ncivilians stood near them. The clatter of male and female voices went on\r\nunceasingly.\r\n\r\n"Enfin! you seem to have quite forgotten us. How have we offended?"\r\nWith these words, intended to convey an idea of intimacy which had never\r\nexisted between herself and Nekhludoff, Anna Ignatievna greeted the\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\n"You are acquainted?--Madam Tilyaevsky, M. Chernoff. Sit down a bit\r\nnearer. Missy _vene donc a notre table on vous apportera votre_ the\r\n. . . And you," she said, having evidently forgotten his name, to an officer\r\nwho was talking to Missy, "do come here. A cup of tea, Prince?"\r\n\r\n"I shall never, never agree with you. It\'s quite simple; she did not\r\nlove," a woman\'s voice was heard saying.\r\n\r\n"But she loved tarts."\r\n\r\n"Oh, your eternal silly jokes!" put in, laughingly, another lady\r\nresplendent in silks, gold, and jewels.\r\n\r\n"C\'est excellent these little biscuits, and so light. I think I\'ll take\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"Well, are you moving soon?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, this is our last day. That\'s why we have come. Yes, it must be\r\nlovely in the country; we are having a delightful spring."\r\n\r\nMissy, with her hat on, in a dark-striped dress of some kind that fitted\r\nher like a skin, was looking very handsome. She blushed when she saw\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"And I thought you had left," she said to him.\r\n\r\n"I am on the point of leaving. Business is keeping me in town, and it is\r\non business I have come here."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come to see mamma? She would like to see you," she said, and\r\nknowing that she was saying what was not true, and that he knew it also,\r\nshe blushed still more.\r\n\r\n"I fear I shall scarcely have time," Nekhludoff said gloomily, trying\r\nto appear as if he had not noticed her blush. Missy frowned angrily,\r\nshrugged her shoulders, and turned towards an elegant officer, who\r\ngrasped the empty cup she was holding, and knocking his sword against\r\nthe chairs, manfully carried the cup across to another table.\r\n\r\n"You must contribute towards the Home fund."\r\n\r\n"I am not refusing, but only wish to keep my bounty fresh for the\r\nlottery. There I shall let it appear in all its glory."\r\n\r\n"Well, look out for yourself," said a voice, followed by an evidently\r\nfeigned laugh.\r\n\r\nAnna Ignatievna was in raptures; her "at-home" had turned out a\r\nbrilliant success. "Micky tells me you are busying yourself with prison\r\nwork. I can understand you so well," she said to Nekhludoff. "Micky (she\r\nmeant her fat husband, Maslennikoff) may have other defects, but you\r\nknow how kind-hearted he is. All these miserable prisoners are his\r\nchildren. He does not regard them in any other light. _Il est d\'une\r\nbonte---_" and she stopped, finding no words to do justice to this bonte\r\nof his, and quickly turned to a shrivelled old woman with bows of lilac\r\nribbon all over, who came in just then.\r\n\r\nHaving said as much as was absolutely necessary, and with as little\r\nmeaning as conventionality required, Nekhludoff rose and went up to\r\nMeslennikoff. "Can you give me a few minutes\' hearing, please?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. Well, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Let us come in here."\r\n\r\nThey entered a small Japanese sitting-room, and sat down by the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE VICE-GOVERNOR SUSPICIOUS.\r\n\r\n"Well? _Je suis a vous_. Will you smoke? But wait a bit; we must be\r\ncareful and not make a mess here," said Maslennikoff, and brought an\r\nashpan. "Well?"\r\n\r\n"There are two matters I wish to ask you about."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!"\r\n\r\nAn expression of gloom and dejection came over Maslennikoff\'s\r\ncountenance, and every trace of the excitement, like that of the dog\'s\r\nwhom its master has scratched behind the cars, vanished completely. The\r\nsound of voices reached them from the drawing-room. A woman\'s voice was\r\nheard, saying, _"Jamais je ne croirais,"_ and a man\'s voice from\r\nthe other side relating something in which the names of la Comtesse\r\nVoronzoff and Victor Apraksine kept recurring. A hum of voices, mixed\r\nwith laughter, came from another side. Maslennikoff tried to listen to\r\nwhat was going on in the drawing-room and to what Nekhludoff was saying\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\n"I am again come about that same woman," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I know. The one innocently condemned."\r\n\r\n"I would like to ask that she should be appointed to serve in the prison\r\nhospital. I have been told that this could be arranged."\r\n\r\nMaslennikoff compressed his lips and meditated. "That will be scarcely\r\npossible," he said. "However, I shall see what can be done, and shall\r\nwire you an answer tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"I have been told that there were many sick, and help was needed."\r\n\r\n"All right, all right. I shall let you know in any case."\r\n\r\n"Please do," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a general and even a natural laugh came from the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all that Victor. He is wonderfully sharp when he is in the right\r\nvein," said Maslennikoff.\r\n\r\n"The next thing I wanted to tell you," said Nekhludoff, "is that 130\r\npersons are imprisoned only because their passports are overdue. They\r\nhave been kept here a month."\r\n\r\nAnd he related the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n"How have you come to know of this?" said Maslennikoff, looking uneasy\r\nand dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n"I went to see a prisoner, and these men came and surrounded me in the\r\ncorridor, and asked . . ."\r\n\r\n"What prisoner did you go to see?"\r\n\r\n"A peasant who is kept in prison, though innocent. I have put his case\r\ninto the hands of a lawyer. But that is not the point."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that people who have done no wrong are imprisoned only\r\nbecause their passports are overdue? And . . ."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the Procureur\'s business," Maslennikoff interrupted, angrily.\r\n"There, now, you see what it is you call a prompt and just form of\r\ntrial. It is the business of the Public Prosecutor to visit the prison\r\nand to find out if the prisoners are kept there lawfully. But that set\r\nplay cards; that\'s all they do."\r\n\r\n"Am I to understand that you can do nothing?" Nekhludoff said,\r\ndespondently, remembering that the advocate had foretold that the\r\nGovernor would put the blame on the Procureur.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I can. I shall see about it at once."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse for her. _C\'est un souffre douleur_," came the voice\r\nof a woman, evidently indifferent to what she was saying, from the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"So much the better. I shall take it also," a man\'s voice was heard to\r\nsay from the other side, followed by the playful laughter of a woman,\r\nwho was apparently trying to prevent the man from taking something away\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n"No, no; not on any account," the woman\'s voice said.\r\n\r\n"All right, then. I shall do all this," Maslennikoff repeated, and put\r\nout the cigarette he held in his white, turquoise-ringed hand. "And now\r\nlet us join the ladies."\r\n\r\n"Wait a moment," Nekhludoff said, stopping at the door of the\r\ndrawing-room. "I was told that some men had received corporal punishment\r\nin the prison yesterday. Is this true?"\r\n\r\nMaslennikoff blushed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s what you are after? No, mon cher, decidedly it won\'t do to\r\nlet you in there; you want to get at everything. Come, come; Anna is\r\ncalling us," he said, catching Nekhludoff by the arm, and again becoming\r\nas excited as after the attention paid him by the important person, only\r\nnow his excitement was not joyful, but anxious.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff pulled his arm away, and without taking leave of any one\r\nand without saying a word, he passed through the drawing-room with a\r\ndejected look, went down into the hall, past the footman, who sprang\r\ntowards him, and out at the street door.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with him? What have you done to him?" asked Anna of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n"This is _a la Francaise_," remarked some one.\r\n\r\n"_A la Francaise_, indeed--it is _a la Zoulou_."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but he\'s always been like that."\r\n\r\nSome one rose, some one came in, and the clatter went on its course.\r\nThe company used this episode with Nekhludoff as a convenient topic of\r\nconversation for the rest of the "at-home."\r\n\r\nOn the day following his visit to Maslennikoff, Nekhludoff received a\r\nletter from him, written in a fine, firm hand, on thick, glazed paper,\r\nwith a coat-of-arms, and sealed with sealing-wax. Maslennikoff said\r\nthat he had written to the doctor concerning Maslova\'s removal to the\r\nhospital, and hoped Nekhludoff\'s wish would receive attention. The\r\nletter was signed, "Your affectionate elder comrade," and the signature\r\nended with a large, firm, and artistic flourish. "Fool!" Nekhludoff\r\ncould not refrain from saying, especially because in the word\r\n"comrade" he felt Maslennikoff\'s condescension towards him, i.e., while\r\nMaslennikoff was filling this position, morally most dirty and shameful,\r\nhe still thought himself a very important man, and wished, if not\r\nexactly to flatter Nekhludoff, at least to show that he was not too\r\nproud to call him comrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF\'S THIRD INTERVIEW WITH MASLOVA IN PRISON.\r\n\r\nOne of the most widespread superstitions is that every man has his own\r\nspecial, definite qualities; that a man is kind, cruel, wise, stupid,\r\nenergetic, apathetic, etc. Men are not like that. We may say of a man\r\nthat he is more often kind than cruel, oftener wise than stupid, oftener\r\nenergetic than apathetic, or the reverse; but it would be false to say\r\nof one man that he is kind and wise, of another that he is wicked and\r\nfoolish. And yet we always classify mankind in this way. And this is\r\nuntrue. Men are like rivers: the water is the same in each, and alike in\r\nall; but every river is narrow here, is more rapid there, here slower,\r\nthere broader, now clear, now cold, now dull, now warm. It is the same\r\nwith men. Every man carries in himself the germs of every human quality,\r\nand sometimes one manifests itself, sometimes another, and the man often\r\nbecomes unlike himself, while still remaining the same man, In some\r\npeople these changes are very rapid, and Nekhludoff was such a man.\r\nThese changes in him were due to physical and to spiritual causes. At\r\nthis time he experienced such a change.\r\n\r\nThat feeling of triumph and joy at the renewal of life which he had\r\nexperienced after the trial and after the first interview with Katusha,\r\nvanished completely, and after the last interview fear and revulsion\r\ntook the place of that joy. He was determined not to leave her, and not\r\nto change his decision of marrying her, if she wished it; but it seemed\r\nvery hard, and made him suffer.\r\n\r\nOn the day after his visit to Maslennikoff, he again went to the prison\r\nto see her.\r\n\r\nThe inspector allowed him to speak to her, only not in the advocate\'s\r\nroom nor in the office, but in the women\'s visiting-room. In spite\r\nof his kindness, the inspector was more reserved with Nekhludoff than\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\nAn order for greater caution had apparently been sent, as a result of\r\nhis conversation with Meslennikoff.\r\n\r\n"You may see her," the inspector said; "but please remember what I\r\nsaid as regards money. And as to her removal to the hospital, that his\r\nexcellency wrote to me about, it can be done; the doctor would agree.\r\nOnly she herself does not wish it. She says, \'Much need have I to carry\r\nout the slops for the scurvy beggars.\' You don\'t know what these people\r\nare, Prince," he added.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff did not reply, but asked to have the interview. The\r\ninspector called a jailer, whom Nekhludoff followed into the women\'s\r\nvisiting-room, where there was no one but Maslova waiting. She came from\r\nbehind the grating, quiet and timid, close up to him, and said, without\r\nlooking at him:\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Dmitri Ivanovitch, I spoke hastily the day before\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"It is not for me to forgive you," Nekhludoff began.\r\n\r\n"But all the same, you must leave me," she interrupted, and in the\r\nterribly squinting eyes with which she looked at him Nekhludoff read the\r\nformer strained, angry expression.\r\n\r\n"Why should I leave you?"\r\n\r\n"So."\r\n\r\n"But why so?"\r\n\r\nShe again looked up, as it seemed to him, with the same angry look.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, thus it is," she said. "You must leave me. It is true\r\nwhat I am saying. I cannot. You just give it up altogether." Her lips\r\ntrembled and she was silent for a moment. "It is true. I\'d rather hang\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt that in this refusal there was hatred and unforgiving\r\nresentment, but there was also something besides, something good. This\r\nconfirmation of the refusal in cold blood at once quenched all the\r\ndoubts in Nekhludoff\'s bosom, and brought back the serious, triumphant\r\nemotion he had felt in relation to Katusha.\r\n\r\n"Katusha, what I have said I will again repeat," he uttered, very\r\nseriously. "I ask you to marry me. If you do not wish it, and for as\r\nlong as you do not wish it, I shall only continue to follow you, and\r\nshall go where you are taken."\r\n\r\n"That is your business. I shall not say anything more," she answered,\r\nand her lips began to tremble again.\r\n\r\nHe, too, was silent, feeling unable to speak.\r\n\r\n"I shall now go to the country, and then to Petersburg," he said, when\r\nhe was quieter again. "I shall do my utmost to get your--our case, I\r\nmean, reconsidered, and by the help of God the sentence may be revoked."\r\n\r\n"And if it is not revoked, never mind. I have deserved it, if not in\r\nthis case, in other ways," she said, and he saw how difficult it was for\r\nher to keep down her tears.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you seen Menshoff?" she suddenly asked, to hide her emotion.\r\n"It\'s true they are innocent, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so."\r\n\r\n"Such a splendid old woman," she said.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause.\r\n\r\n"Well, and as to the hospital?" she suddenly said, and looking at him\r\nwith her squinting eyes. "If you like, I will go, and I shall not drink\r\nany spirits, either."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked into her eyes. They were smiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, she is quite a different being," Nekhludoff thought. After\r\nall his former doubts, he now felt something he had never before\r\nexperienced--the certainty that love is invincible.\r\n\r\nWhen Maslova returned to her noisome cell after this interview, she took\r\noff her cloak and sat down in her place on the shelf bedstead with her\r\nhands folded on her lap. In the cell were only the consumptive woman,\r\nthe Vladimir woman with her baby, Menshoff\'s old mother, and the\r\nwatchman\'s wife. The deacon\'s daughter had the day before been declared\r\nmentally diseased and removed to the hospital. The rest of the women\r\nwere away, washing clothes. The old woman was asleep, the cell door\r\nstood open, and the watchman\'s children were in the corridor outside.\r\nThe Vladimir woman, with her baby in her arms, and the watchman\'s\r\nwife, with the stocking she was knitting with deft fingers, came up to\r\nMaslova. "Well, have you had a chat?" they asked. Maslova sat silent on\r\nthe high bedstead, swinging her legs, which did not reach to the floor.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the good of snivelling?" said the watchman\'s wife. "The chief\r\nthing\'s not to go down into the dumps. Eh, Katusha? Now, then!" and she\r\nwent on, quickly moving her fingers.\r\n\r\nMaslova did not answer.\r\n\r\n"And our women have all gone to wash," said the Vladimir woman. "I\r\nheard them say much has been given in alms to-day. Quite a lot has been\r\nbrought."\r\n\r\n"Finashka," called out the watchman\'s wife, "where\'s the little imp gone\r\nto?"\r\n\r\nShe took a knitting needle, stuck it through both the ball and the\r\nstocking, and went out into the corridor.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sound of women\'s voices was heard from the corridor,\r\nand the inmates of the cell entered, with their prison shoes, but\r\nno stockings on their feet. Each was carrying a roll, some even two.\r\nTheodosia came at once up to Maslova.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter; is anything wrong?" Theodosia asked, looking\r\nlovingly at Maslova with her clear, blue eyes. "This is for our tea,"\r\nand she put the rolls on a shelf.\r\n\r\n"Why, surely he has not changed his mind about marrying?" asked\r\nKorableva.\r\n\r\n"No, he has not, but I don\'t wish to," said Maslova, "and so I told\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"More fool you!" muttered Korableva in her deep tones.\r\n\r\n"If one\'s not to live together, what\'s the use of marrying?" said\r\nTheodosia.\r\n\r\n"There\'s your husband--he\'s going with you," said the watchman\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, we\'re married," said Theodosia. "But why should he go\r\nthrough the ceremony if he is not to live with her?"\r\n\r\n"Why, indeed! Don\'t be a fool! You know if he marries her she\'ll roll in\r\nwealth," said Korableva.\r\n\r\n"He says, \'Wherever they take you, I\'ll follow,\'" said Maslova. "If he\r\ndoes, it\'s well; if he does not, well also. I am not going to ask him\r\nto. Now he is going to try and arrange the matter in Petersburg. He is\r\nrelated to all the Ministers there. But, all the same, I have no need of\r\nhim," she continued.\r\n\r\n"Of course not," suddenly agreed Korableva, evidently thinking about\r\nsomething else as she sat examining her bag. "Well, shall we have a\r\ndrop?"\r\n\r\n"You have some," replied Maslova. "I won\'t."\r\n\r\nEND OF BOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPROPERTY IN LAND.\r\n\r\nIt was possible for Maslova\'s case to come before the Senate in a\r\nfortnight, at which time Nekhludoff meant to go to Petersburg, and, if\r\nneed be, to appeal to the Emperor (as the advocate who had drawn up the\r\npetition advised) should the appeal be disregarded (and, according to\r\nthe advocate, it was best to be prepared for that, since the causes for\r\nappeal were so slight). The party of convicts, among whom was Maslova,\r\nwould very likely leave in the beginning of June. In order to be able to\r\nfollow her to Siberia, as Nekhludoff was firmly resolved to do, he was\r\nnow obliged to visit his estates, and settle matters there. Nekhludoff\r\nfirst went to the nearest, Kousminski, a large estate that lay in the\r\nblack earth district, and from which he derived the greatest part of his\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nHe had lived on that estate in his childhood and youth, and had been\r\nthere twice since, and once, at his mother\'s request, he had taken a\r\nGerman steward there, and had with him verified the accounts. The state\r\nof things there and the peasants\' relations to the management, i.e.,\r\nthe landlord, had therefore been long known to him. The relations of the\r\npeasants to the administration were those of utter dependence on that\r\nmanagement. Nekhludoff knew all this when still a university student,\r\nhe had confessed and preached Henry Georgeism, and, on the basis of that\r\nteaching, had given the land inherited from his father to the peasants.\r\nIt is true that after entering the army, when he got into the habit of\r\nspending 20,000 roubles a year, those former occupations ceased to be\r\nregarded as a duty, and were forgotten, and he not only left off asking\r\nhimself where the money his mother allowed him came from, but even\r\navoided thinking about it. But his mother\'s death, the coming into the\r\nproperty, and the necessity of managing it, again raised the question\r\nas to what his position in reference to private property in land was. A\r\nmonth before Nekhludoff would have answered that he had not the strength\r\nto alter the existing order of things; that it was not he who was\r\nadministering the estate; and would one way or another have eased his\r\nconscience, continuing to live far from his estates, and having the\r\nmoney sent him. But now he decided that he could not leave things to go\r\non as they were, but would have to alter them in a way unprofitable\r\nto himself, even though he had all these complicated and difficult\r\nrelations with the prison world which made money necessary, as well as a\r\nprobable journey to Siberia before him. Therefore he decided not to farm\r\nthe land, but to let it to the peasants at a low rent, to enable them\r\nto cultivate it without depending on a landlord. More than once, when\r\ncomparing the position of a landowner with that of an owner of serfs,\r\nNekhludoff had compared the renting of land to the peasants instead\r\nof cultivating it with hired labour, to the old system by which serf\r\nproprietors used to exact a money payment from their serfs in place of\r\nlabour. It was not a solution of the problem, and yet a step towards the\r\nsolution; it was a movement towards a less rude form of slavery. And it\r\nwas in this way he meant to act.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff reached Kousminski about noon. Trying to simplify his life\r\nin every way, he did not telegraph, but hired a cart and pair at the\r\nstation. The driver was a young fellow in a nankeen coat, with a belt\r\nbelow his long waist. He was glad to talk to the gentleman, especially\r\nbecause while they were talking his broken-winded white horse and the\r\nemaciated spavined one could go at a foot-pace, which they always liked\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nThe driver spoke about the steward at Kousminski without knowing that he\r\nwas driving "the master." Nekhludoff had purposely not told him who he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"That ostentatious German," said the driver (who had been to town and\r\nread novels) as he sat sideways on the box, passing his hand from\r\nthe top to the bottom of his long whip, and trying to show off his\r\naccomplishments--"that ostentatious German has procured three light\r\nbays, and when he drives out with his lady---oh, my! At Christmas he had\r\na Christmas-tree in the big house. I drove some of the visitors there.\r\nIt had \'lectric lights; you could not see the like of it in the whole\r\nof the government. What\'s it to him, he has cribbed a heap of money. I\r\nheard say he has bought an estate."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had imagined that he was quite indifferent to the way the\r\nsteward managed his estate, and what advantages the steward derived from\r\nit. The words of the long-waisted driver, however, were not pleasant to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nA dark cloud now and then covered the sun; the larks were soaring above\r\nthe fields of winter corn; the forests were already covered with fresh\r\nyoung green; the meadows speckled with grazing cattle and horses. The\r\nfields were being ploughed, and Nekhludoff enjoyed the lovely day. But\r\nevery now and then he had an unpleasant feeling, and, when he asked\r\nhimself what it was caused by, he remembered what the driver had told\r\nhim about the way the German was managing Kousminski. When he got to his\r\nestate and set to work this unpleasant feeling vanished.\r\n\r\nLooking over the books in the office, and a talk with the foreman, who\r\nnaively pointed out the advantages to be derived from the facts that the\r\npeasants had very little land of their own and that it lay in the midst\r\nof the landlord\'s fields, made Nekhludoff more than ever determined to\r\nleave off farming and to let his land to the peasants.\r\n\r\nFrom the office books and his talk with the foreman, Nekhludoff found\r\nthat two-thirds of the best of the cultivated land was still being\r\ntilled with improved machinery by labourers receiving fixed wages, while\r\nthe other third was tilled by the peasants at the rate of five roubles\r\nper desiatin [about two and three-quarter acres]. So that the peasants\r\nhad to plough each desiatin three times, harrow it three times, sow\r\nand mow the corn, make it into sheaves, and deliver it on the threshing\r\nground for five roubles, while the same amount of work done by wage\r\nlabour came to at least 10 roubles. Everything the peasants got from the\r\noffice they paid for in labour at a very high price. They paid in labour\r\nfor the use of the meadows, for wood, for potato-stalks, and were nearly\r\nall of them in debt to the office. Thus, for the land that lay beyond\r\nthe cultivated fields, which the peasants hired, four times the price\r\nthat its value would bring in if invested at five per cent was taken\r\nfrom the peasants.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had known all this before, but he now saw it in a new light,\r\nand wondered how he and others in his position could help seeing how\r\nabnormal such conditions are. The steward\'s arguments that if the land\r\nwere let to the peasants the agricultural implements would fetch next to\r\nnothing, as it would be impossible to get even a quarter of their value\r\nfor them, and that the peasants would spoil the land, and how great a\r\nloser Nekhludoff would be, only strengthened Nekhludoff in the opinion\r\nthat he was doing a good action in letting the land to the peasants\r\nand thus depriving himself of a large part of his income. He decided to\r\nsettle this business now, at once, while he was there. The reaping and\r\nselling of the corn he left for the steward to manage in due season, and\r\nalso the selling of the agricultural implements and useless buildings.\r\nBut he asked his steward to call the peasants of the three neighbouring\r\nvillages that lay in the midst of his estate (Kousminski) to a meeting,\r\nat which he would tell them of his intentions and arrange about the\r\nprice at which they were to rent the land.\r\n\r\nWith the pleasant sense of the firmness he had shown in the face of the\r\nsteward\'s arguments, and his readiness to make a sacrifice, Nekhludoff\r\nleft the office, thinking over the business before him, and strolled\r\nround the house, through the neglected flower-garden--this year the\r\nflowers were planted in front of the steward\'s house--over the tennis\r\nground, now overgrown with dandelions, and along the lime-tree walk,\r\nwhere he used to smoke his cigar, and where he had flirted with the\r\npretty Kirimova, his mother\'s visitor. Having briefly prepared in his\r\nmind the speech he was going to make to the peasants, he again went in\r\nto the steward, and, after tea, having once more arranged his thoughts,\r\nhe went into the room prepared for him in the big house, which used to\r\nbe a spare bedroom.\r\n\r\nIn this clean little room, with pictures of Venice on the walls, and a\r\nmirror between the two windows, there stood a clean bed with a spring\r\nmattress, and by the side of it a small table, with a decanter of water,\r\nmatches, and an extinguisher. On a table by the looking-glass lay his\r\nopen portmanteau, with his dressing-case and some books in it; a Russian\r\nbook, The Investigation of the Laws of Criminality, and a German and\r\nan English book on the same subject, which he meant to read while\r\ntravelling in the country. But it was too late to begin to-day, and he\r\nbegan preparing to go to bed.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned inlaid mahogany arm-chair stood in the corner of\r\nthe room, and this chair, which Nekhludoff remembered standing in his\r\nmother\'s bedroom, suddenly raised a perfectly unexpected sensation in\r\nhis soul. He was suddenly filled with regret at the thought of the house\r\nthat would tumble to ruin, and the garden that would run wild, and the\r\nforest that would be cut down, and all these farmyards, stables, sheds,\r\nmachines, horses, cows which he knew had cost so much effort, though not\r\nto himself, to acquire and to keep. It had seemed easy to give up all\r\nthis, but now it was hard, not only to give this, but even to let the\r\nland and lose half his income. And at once a consideration, which proved\r\nthat it was unreasonable to let the land to the peasants, and thus to\r\ndestroy his property, came to his service. "I must not hold property in\r\nland. If I possess no property in land, I cannot keep up the house and\r\nfarm. And, besides, I am going to Siberia, and shall not need either\r\nthe house or the estate," said one voice. "All this is so," said another\r\nvoice, "but you are not going to spend all your life in Siberia. You may\r\nmarry, and have children, and must hand the estate on to them in as good\r\na condition as you received it. There is a duty to the land, too.\r\nTo give up, to destroy everything is very easy; to acquire it very\r\ndifficult. Above all, you must consider your future life, and what\r\nyou will do with yourself, and you must dispose of your property\r\naccordingly. And are you really firm in your resolve? And then, are you\r\nreally acting according to your conscience, or are you acting in order\r\nto be admired of men?" Nekhludoff asked himself all this, and had to\r\nacknowledge that he was influenced by the thought of what people would\r\nsay about him. And the more he thought about it the more questions\r\narose, and the more unsolvable they seemed.\r\n\r\nIn hopes of ridding himself of these thoughts by falling asleep, and\r\nsolving them in the morning when his head would be fresh, he lay down on\r\nhis clean bed. But it was long before he could sleep. Together with the\r\nfresh air and the moonlight, the croaking of the frogs entered the room,\r\nmingling with the trills of a couple of nightingales in the park and\r\none close to the window in a bush of lilacs in bloom. Listening to\r\nthe nightingales and the frogs, Nekhludoff remembered the inspector\'s\r\ndaughter, and her music, and the inspector; that reminded him of\r\nMaslova, and how her lips trembled, like the croaking of the frogs, when\r\nshe said, "You must just leave it." Then the German steward began going\r\ndown to the frogs, and had to be held back, but he not only went down\r\nbut turned into Maslova, who began reproaching Nekhludoff, saying, "You\r\nare a prince, and I am a convict." "No, I must not give in," thought\r\nNekhludoff, waking up, and again asking himself, "Is what I am doing\r\nright? I do not know, and no matter, no matter, I must only fall asleep\r\nnow." And he began himself to descend where he had seen the inspector\r\nand Maslova climbing down to, and there it all ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEFFORTS AT LAND RESTORATION.\r\n\r\nThe next day Nekhludoff awoke at nine o\'clock. The young office clerk\r\nwho attended on "the master" brought him his boots, shining as they had\r\nnever shone before, and some cold, beautifully clear spring water, and\r\ninformed him that the peasants were already assembling.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff jumped out of bed, and collected his thoughts. Not a trace\r\nof yesterday\'s regret at giving up and thus destroying his property\r\nremained now. He remembered this feeling of regret with surprise; he was\r\nnow looking forward with joy to the task before him, and could not help\r\nbeing proud of it. He could see from the window the old tennis ground,\r\novergrown with dandelions, on which the peasants were beginning to\r\nassemble. The frogs had not croaked in vain the night before; the day\r\nwas dull. There was no wind; a soft warm rain had begun falling in the\r\nmorning, and hung in drops on leaves, twigs, and grass. Besides the\r\nsmell of the fresh vegetation, the smell of damp earth, asking for more\r\nrain, entered in at the window. While dressing, Nekhludoff several times\r\nlooked out at the peasants gathered on the tennis ground. One by one\r\nthey came, took off their hats or caps to one another, and took their\r\nplaces in a circle, leaning on their sticks. The steward, a stout,\r\nmuscular, strong young man, dressed in a short pea-jacket, with a\r\ngreen stand-up collar, and enormous buttons, came to say that all had\r\nassembled, but that they might wait until Nekhludoff had finished his\r\nbreakfast--tea and coffee, whichever he pleased; both were ready.\r\n\r\n"No, I think I had better go and see them at once," said Nekhludoff,\r\nwith an unexpected feeling of shyness and shame at the thought of the\r\nconversation he was going to have with the peasants. He was going to\r\nfulfil a wish of the peasants, the fulfilment of which they did not\r\neven dare to hope for--to let the land to them at a low price, i.e.,\r\nto confer a great boon; and yet he felt ashamed of something. When\r\nNekhludoff came up to the peasants, and the fair, the curly, the bald,\r\nthe grey heads were bared before him, he felt so confused that he\r\ncould say nothing. The rain continued to come down in small drops,\r\nthat remained on the hair, the beards, and the fluff of the men\'s rough\r\ncoats. The peasants looked at "the master," waiting for him to speak,\r\nand he was so abashed that he could not speak. This confused silence\r\nwas broken by the sedate, self-assured German steward, who considered\r\nhimself a good judge of the Russian peasant, and who spoke Russian\r\nremarkably well. This strong, over-fed man, and Nekhludoff himself,\r\npresented a striking contrast to the peasants, with their thin, wrinkled\r\nfaces and the shoulder blades protruding beneath their coarse coats.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the Prince wanting to do you a favor, and to let the land to\r\nyou; only you are not worthy of it," said the steward.\r\n\r\n"How are we not worthy of it, Vasili Karlovitch? Don\'t we work for you?\r\nWe were well satisfied with the deceased lady--God have mercy on her\r\nsoul--and the young Prince will not desert us now. Our thanks to him,"\r\nsaid a redhaired, talkative peasant.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s why I have called you together. I should like to let you\r\nhave all the land, if you wish it."\r\n\r\nThe peasants said nothing, as if they did not understand or did not\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see. Let us have the land? What do you mean?" asked a middle-aged\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"To let it to you, that you might have the use of it, at a low rent."\r\n\r\n"A very agreeable thing," said an old man.\r\n\r\n"If only the pay is such as we can afford," said another.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no reason why we should not rent the land."\r\n\r\n"We are accustomed to live by tilling the ground."\r\n\r\n"And it\'s quieter for you, too, that way. You\'ll have to do nothing\r\nbut receive the rent. Only think of all the sin and worry now!" several\r\nvoices were heard saying.\r\n\r\n"The sin is all on your side," the German remarked. "If only you did\r\nyour work, and were orderly."\r\n\r\n"That\'s impossible for the likes of us," said a sharp-nosed old man.\r\n"You say, \'Why do you let the horse get into the corn?\' just as if I\r\nlet it in. Why, I was swinging my scythe, or something of the kind,\r\nthe livelong day, till the day seemed as long as a year, and so I fell\r\nasleep while watching the herd of horses at night, and it got into your\r\noats, and now you\'re skinning me."\r\n\r\n"And you should keep order."\r\n\r\n"It\'s easy for you to talk about order, but it\'s more than our strength\r\nwill bear," answered a tall, dark, hairy middleaged man.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you to put up a fence?"\r\n\r\n"You give us the wood to make it of," said a short, plain-looking\r\npeasant. "I was going to put up a fence last year, and you put me to\r\nfeed vermin in prison for three months. That was the end of that fence."\r\n\r\n"What is it he is saying?" asked Nekhludoff, turning to the steward.\r\n\r\n"Der ersto Dieb im Dorfe," [The greatest thief in the village] answered\r\nthe steward in German. "He is caught stealing wood from the forest every\r\nyear." Then turning to the peasant, he added, "You must learn to respect\r\nother people\'s property."\r\n\r\n"Why, don\'t we respect you?" said an old man. "We are obliged to respect\r\nyou. Why, you could twist us into a rope; we are in your hands."\r\n\r\n"Eh, my friend, it\'s impossible to do you. It\'s you who are ever ready\r\nto do us," said the steward.\r\n\r\n"Do you, indeed. Didn\'t you smash my jaw for me, and I got nothing for\r\nit? No good going to law with the rich, it seems."\r\n\r\n"You should keep to the law."\r\n\r\nA tournament of words was apparently going on without those who took\r\npart in it knowing exactly what it was all about; but it was noticeable\r\nthat there was bitterness on one side, restricted by fear, and on the\r\nother a consciousness of importance and power. It was very trying to\r\nNekhludoff to listen to all this, so he returned to the question of\r\narranging the amount and the terms of the rent.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, how about the land? Do you wish to take it, and what price\r\nwill you pay if I let you have the whole of it?"\r\n\r\n"The property is yours: it is for you to fix the price."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff named the price. Though it was far below that paid in the\r\nneighbourhood, the peasants declared it too high, and began bargaining,\r\nas is customary among them. Nekhludoff thought his offer would be\r\naccepted with pleasure, but no signs of pleasure were visible.\r\n\r\nOne thing only showed Nekhludoff that his offer was a profitable one\r\nto the peasants. The question as to who would rent the land, the whole\r\ncommune or a special society, was put, and a violent dispute arose among\r\nthose peasants who were in favour of excluding the weak and those not\r\nlikely to pay the rent regularly, and the peasants who would have to be\r\nexcluded on that score. At last, thanks to the steward, the amount and\r\nthe terms of the rent were fixed, and the peasants went down the hill\r\ntowards their villages, talking noisily, while Nekhludoff and the\r\nsteward went into the office to make up the agreement. Everything was\r\nsettled in the way Nekhludoff wished and expected it to be. The peasants\r\nhad their land 30 per cent. cheaper than they could have got it anywhere\r\nin the district, the revenue from the land was diminished by half, but\r\nwas more than sufficient for Nekhludoff, especially as there would be\r\nmoney coming in for a forest he sold, as well as for the agricultural\r\nimplements, which would be sold, too. Everything seemed excellently\r\narranged, yet he felt ashamed of something. He could see that the\r\npeasants, though they spoke words of thanks, were not satisfied, and\r\nhad expected something greater. So it turned out that he had deprived\r\nhimself of a great deal, and yet not done what the peasants had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe next day the agreement was signed, and accompanied by several old\r\npeasants, who had been chosen as deputies, Nekhludoff went out, got\r\ninto the steward\'s elegant equipage (as the driver from the station had\r\ncalled it), said "good-bye" to the peasants, who stood shaking their\r\nheads in a dissatisfied and disappointed manner, and drove off to the\r\nstation. Nekhludoff was dissatisfied with himself without knowing why,\r\nbut all the time he felt sad and ashamed of something.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOLD ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nFrom Kousminski Nekhludoff went to the estate he had inherited from his\r\naunts, the same where he first met Katusha. He meant to arrange about\r\nthe land there in the way he had done in Kousminski. Besides this, he\r\nwished to find out all he could about Katusha and her baby, and when and\r\nhow it had died. He got to Panovo early one morning, and the first thing\r\nthat struck him when he drove up was the look of decay and dilapidation\r\nthat all the buildings bore, especially the house itself. The iron\r\nroofs, which had once been painted green, looked red with rust, and\r\na few sheets of iron were bent back, probably by a storm. Some of the\r\nplanks which covered the house from outside were torn away in several\r\nplaces; these were easier to get by breaking the rusty nails that held\r\nthem. Both porches, but especially the side porch he remembered so well,\r\nwere rotten and broken; only the banister remained. Some of the windows\r\nwere boarded up, and the building in which the foreman lived, the\r\nkitchen, the stables--all were grey and decaying. Only the garden had\r\nnot decayed, but had grown, and was in full bloom; from over the fence\r\nthe cherry, apple, and plum trees looked like white clouds. The lilac\r\nbushes that formed the hedge were in full bloom, as they had been\r\nwhen, 14 years ago, Nekhludoff had played gorelki with the 15-year-old\r\nKatusha, and had fallen and got his hand stung by the nettles behind one\r\nof those lilac bushes. The larch that his aunt Sophia had planted near\r\nthe house, which then was only a short stick, had grown into a tree,\r\nthe trunk of which would have made a beam, and its branches were covered\r\nwith soft yellow green needles as with down. The river, now within its\r\nbanks, rushed noisily over the mill dam. The meadow the other side of\r\nthe river was dotted over by the peasants\' mixed herds. The foreman,\r\na student, who had left the seminary without finishing the course, met\r\nNekhludoff in the yard, with a smile on his face, and, still smiling,\r\nasked him to come into the office, and, as if promising something\r\nexceptionally good by this smile, he went behind a partition. For a\r\nmoment some whispering was heard behind the partition. The isvostchik\r\nwho had driven Nekhludoff from the station, drove away after receiving\r\na tip, and all was silent. Then a barefooted girl passed the window;\r\nshe had on an embroidered peasant blouse, and long earrings in her ears;\r\nthen a man walked past, clattering with his nailed boots on the trodden\r\npath.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat down by the little casement, and looked out into the\r\ngarden and listened. A soft, fresh spring breeze, smelling of newly-dug\r\nearth, streamed in through the window, playing with the hair on his damp\r\nforehead and the papers that lay on the window-sill, which was all cut\r\nabout with a knife.\r\n\r\n"Tra-pa-trop, tra-pa-trop," comes a sound from the river, as the women\r\nwho were washing clothes there slapped them in regular measure with\r\ntheir wooden bats, and the sound spread over the glittering surface of\r\nthe mill pond while the rhythmical sound of the falling water came from\r\nthe mill, and a frightened fly suddenly flew loudly buzzing past his\r\near.\r\n\r\nAnd all at once Nekhludoff remembered how, long ago, when he was young\r\nand innocent, he had heard the women\'s wooden bats slapping the wet\r\nclothes above the rhythmical sound from the mill, and in the same way\r\nthe spring breeze had blown about the hair on his wet forehead and the\r\npapers on the window-sill, which was all cut about with a knife, and\r\njust in the same way a fly had buzzed loudly past his car.\r\n\r\nIt was not exactly that he remembered himself as a lad of 15, but he\r\nseemed to feel himself the same as he was then, with the same freshness\r\nand purity, and full of the same grand possibilities for the future, and\r\nat the same time, as it happens in a dream, he knew that all this could\r\nbe no more, and he felt terribly sad. "At what time would you like\r\nsomething to eat?" asked the foreman, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"When you like; I am not hungry. I shall go for a walk through the\r\nvillage."\r\n\r\n"Would you not like to come into the house? Everything is in order\r\nthere. Have the goodness to look in. If the outside---"\r\n\r\n"Not now; later on. Tell me, please, have you got a woman here called\r\nMatrona Kharina?" (This was Katusha\'s aunt, the village midwife.)\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; in the village she keeps a secret pot-house. I know she does,\r\nand I accuse her of it and scold her; but as to taking her up, it would\r\nbe a pity. An old woman, you know; she has grandchildren," said the\r\nforeman, continuing to smile in the same manner, partly wishing to\r\nbe pleasant to the master, and partly because he was convinced that\r\nNekhludoff understood all these matters just as well as he did himself.\r\n\r\n"Where does she live? I shall go across and see her."\r\n\r\n"At the end of the village; the further side, the third from the end. To\r\nthe left there is a brick cottage, and her hut is beyond that. But I\'d\r\nbetter see you there," the foreman said with a graceful smile.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks, I shall find it; and you be so good as to call a meeting\r\nof the peasants, and tell them that I want to speak to them about\r\nthe land," said Nekhludoff, with the intention of coming to the same\r\nagreement with the peasants here as he had done in Kousminski, and, if\r\npossible, that same evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANTS\' LOT.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff came out of the gate he met the girl with the long\r\nearrings on the well-trodden path that lay across the pasture\r\nground, overgrown with dock and plantain leaves. She had a long,\r\nbrightly-coloured apron on, and was quickly swinging her left arm in\r\nfront of herself as she stepped briskly with her fat, bare feet. With\r\nher right arm she was pressing a fowl to her stomach. The fowl, with\r\nred comb shaking, seemed perfectly calm; he only rolled up his eyes and\r\nstretched out and drew in one black leg, clawing the girl\'s apron. When\r\nthe girl came nearer to "the master," she began moving more slowly, and\r\nher run changed into a walk. When she came up to him she stopped, and,\r\nafter a backward jerk with her head, bowed to him; and only when he had\r\npassed did she recommence to run homeward with the cock. As he went down\r\ntowards the well, he met an old woman, who had a coarse dirty blouse on,\r\ncarrying two pails full of water, that hung on a yoke across her bent\r\nback. The old woman carefully put down the pails and bowed, with the\r\nsame backward jerk of her head.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the well Nekhludoff entered the village. It was a bright,\r\nhot day, and oppressive, though only ten o\'clock. At intervals the sun\r\nwas hidden by the gathering clouds. An unpleasant, sharp smell of manure\r\nfilled the air in the street. It came from carts going up the hillside,\r\nbut chiefly from the disturbed manure heaps in the yards of the huts,\r\nby the open gates of which Nekhludoff had to pass. The peasants,\r\nbarefooted, their shirts and trousers soiled with manure, turned to look\r\nat the tall, stout gentleman with the glossy silk ribbon on his grey hat\r\nwho was walking up the village street, touching the ground every other\r\nstep with a shiny, bright-knobbed walking-stick. The peasants returning\r\nfrom the fields at a trot and jotting in their empty carts, took\r\noff their hats, and, in their surprise, followed with their eyes the\r\nextraordinary man who was walking up their street. The women came out\r\nof the gates or stood in the porches of their huts, pointing him out to\r\neach other and gazing at him as he passed.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff was passing the fourth gate, he was stopped by a cart\r\nthat was coming out, its wheels creaking, loaded high with manure, which\r\nwas pressed down, and was covered with a mat to sit on. A six-year-old\r\nboy, excited by the prospect of a drive, followed the cart. A young\r\npeasant, with shoes plaited out of bark on his feet, led the horse out\r\nof the yard. A long-legged colt jumped out of the gate; but, seeing\r\nNekhludoff, pressed close to the cart, and scraping its legs against the\r\nwheels, jumped forward, past its excited, gently-neighing mother, as she\r\nwas dragging the heavy load through the gateway. The next horse was led\r\nout by a barefooted old man, with protruding shoulder-blades, in a dirty\r\nshirt and striped trousers.\r\n\r\nWhen the horses got out on to the hard road, strewn over with bits\r\nof dry, grey manure, the old man returned to the gate, and bowed to\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"You are our ladies\' nephew, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am their nephew."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve kindly come to look us up, eh?" said the garrulous old man.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have. Well, how are you getting on?"\r\n\r\n"How do we get on? We get on very badly," the old man drawled, as if it\r\ngave him pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Why so badly?" Nekhludoff asked, stepping inside the gate.\r\n\r\n"What is our life but the very worst life?" said the old man, following\r\nNekhludoff into that part of the yard which was roofed over.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stopped under the roof.\r\n\r\n"I have got 12 of them there," continued the old man, pointing to two\r\nwomen on the remainder of the manure heap, who stood perspiring with\r\nforks in their hands, the kerchiefs tumbling off their heads, with their\r\nskirts tucked up, showing the calves of their dirty, bare legs. "Not a\r\nmonth passes but I have to buy six poods [a pood is 36 English pounds]\r\nof corn, and where\'s the money to come from?"\r\n\r\n"Have you not got enough corn of your own?"\r\n\r\n"My own?" repeated the old man, with a smile of contempt; "why I have\r\nonly got land for three, and last year we had not enough to last till\r\nChristmas."\r\n\r\n"What do you do then?"\r\n\r\n"What do we do? Why, I hire out as a labourer; and then I borrowed some\r\nmoney from your honour. We spent it all before Lent, and the tax is not\r\npaid yet."\r\n\r\n"And how much is the tax?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s 17 roubles for my household. Oh, Lord, such a life! One\r\nhardly knows one\'s self how one manages to live it."\r\n\r\n"May I go into your hut?" asked Nekhludoff, stepping across the yard\r\nover the yellow-brown layers of manure that had been raked up by the\r\nforks, and were giving off a strong smell.\r\n\r\n"Why not? Come in," said the old man, and stepping quickly with his\r\nbare feet over the manure, the liquid oozing between his toes, he passed\r\nNekhludoff and opened the door of the hut.\r\n\r\nThe women arranged the kerchiefs on their heads and let down their\r\nskirts, and stood looking with surprise at the clean gentleman with gold\r\nstuds to his sleeves who was entering their house. Two little girls,\r\nwith nothing on but coarse chemises, rushed out of the hut. Nekhludoff\r\ntook off his hat, and, stooping to get through the low door, entered,\r\nthrough a passage into the dirty, narrow hut, that smelt of sour food,\r\nand where much space was taken up by two weaving looms. In the hut an\r\nold woman was standing by the stove, with the sleeves rolled up over her\r\nthin, sinewy brown arms.\r\n\r\n"Here is our master come to see us," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he\'s very welcome," said the old woman, kindly.\r\n\r\n"I would like to see how you live."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see how we live. The hut is coming down, and might kill one\r\nany day; but my old man he says it\'s good enough, and so we live like\r\nkings," said the brisk old woman, nervously jerking her head. "I\'m\r\ngetting the dinner; going to feed the workers."\r\n\r\n"And what are you going to have for dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Our food is very good. First course, bread and kvas; [kvas is a kind of\r\nsour, non-intoxicant beer made of rye] second course, kvas and bread,"\r\nsaid the old woman, showing her teeth, which were half worn away.\r\n\r\n"No," seriously; "let me see what you are going to eat."\r\n\r\n"To eat?" said the old man, laughing. "Ours is not a very cunning meal.\r\nYou just show him, wife."\r\n\r\n"Want to see our peasant food? Well, you are an inquisitive gentleman,\r\nnow I come to look at you. He wants to know everything. Did I not tell\r\nyou bread and kvas and then we\'ll have soup. A woman brought us some\r\nfish, and that\'s what the soup is made of, and after that, potatoes."\r\n\r\n"Nothing more?"\r\n\r\n"What more do you want? We\'ll also have a little milk," said the old\r\nwoman, looking towards the door. The door stood open, and the passage\r\noutside was full of people--boys, girls, women with babies--thronged\r\ntogether to look at the strange gentleman who wanted to see the\r\npeasants\' food. The old woman seemed to pride herself on the way she\r\nbehaved with a gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s a miserable life, ours; that goes without saying, sir," said\r\nthe old man. "What are you doing there?" he shouted to those in the\r\npassage. "Well, good-bye," said Nekhludoff, feeling ashamed and uneasy,\r\nthough unable to account for the feeling.\r\n\r\n"Thank you kindly for having looked us up," said the old man.\r\n\r\nThe people in the passage pressed closer together to let Nekhludoff\r\npass, and he went out and continued his way up the street.\r\n\r\nTwo barefooted boys followed him out of the passage the elder in a\r\nshirt that had once been white, the other in a worn and faded pink one.\r\nNekhludoff looked back at them.\r\n\r\n"And where are you going now?" asked the boy with the white shirt.\r\nNekhludoff answered: "To Matrona Kharina. Do you know her?" The boy\r\nwith the pink shirt began laughing at something; but the elder asked,\r\nseriously:\r\n\r\n"What Matrona is that? Is she old?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is old."\r\n\r\n"Oh--oh," he drawled; "that one; she\'s at the other end of the village;\r\nwe\'ll show you. Yes, Fedka, we\'ll go with him. Shall we?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but the horses?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be all right, I dare say."\r\n\r\nFedka agreed, and all three went up the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA\'S AUNT.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt more at ease with the boys than with the grown-up\r\npeople, and he began talking to them as they went along. The little\r\none with the pink shirt stopped laughing, and spoke as sensibly and as\r\nexactly as the elder one.\r\n\r\n"Can you tell me who are the poorest people you have got here?" asked\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"The poorest? Michael is poor, Simon Makhroff, and Martha, she is very\r\npoor."\r\n\r\n"And Anisia, she is still poorer; she\'s not even got a cow. They go\r\nbegging," said little Fedka.\r\n\r\n"She\'s not got a cow, but they are only three persons, and Martha\'s\r\nfamily are five," objected the elder boy.\r\n\r\n"But the other\'s a widow," the pink boy said, standing up for Anisia.\r\n\r\n"You say Anisia is a widow, and Martha is no better than a widow," said\r\nthe elder boy; "she\'s also no husband."\r\n\r\n"And where is her husband?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Feeding vermin in prison," said the elder boy, using this expression,\r\ncommon among the peasants.\r\n\r\n"A year ago he cut down two birch trees in the land-lord\'s forest," the\r\nlittle pink boy hurried to say, "so he was locked up; now he\'s sitting\r\nthe sixth month there, and the wife goes begging. There are three\r\nchildren and a sick grandmother," he went on with his detailed account.\r\n\r\n"And where does she live?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"In this very house," answered the boy, pointing to a hut, in front\r\nof which, on the footpath along which Nekhludoff was walking, a tiny,\r\nflaxen-headed infant stood balancing himself with difficulty on his\r\nrickety legs.\r\n\r\n"Vaska! Where\'s the little scamp got to?" shouted a woman, with a dirty\r\ngrey blouse, and a frightened look, as she ran out of the house, and,\r\nrushing forward, seized the baby before Nekhludoff came up to it, and\r\ncarried it in, just as if she were afraid that Nekhludoff would hurt her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThis was the woman whose husband was imprisoned for Nekhludoff\'s birch\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n"Well, and this Matrona, is she also poor?" Nekhludoff asked, as they\r\ncame up to Matrona\'s house.\r\n\r\n"She poor? No. Why, she sells spirits," the thin, pink little boy\r\nanswered decidedly.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the house Nekhludoff left the boys outside and went\r\nthrough the passage into the hut. The hut was 14 feet long. The bed\r\nthat stood behind the big stove was not long enough for a tall person\r\nto stretch out on. "And on this very bed," Nekhludoff thought, "Katusha\r\nbore her baby and lay ill afterwards." The greater part of the hut was\r\ntaken up by a loom, on which the old woman and her eldest granddaughter\r\nwere arranging the warp when Nekhludoff came in, striking his forehead\r\nagainst the low doorway. Two other grandchildren came rushing in after\r\nNekhludoff, and stopped, holding on to the lintels of the door.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you want?" asked the old woman, crossly. She was in a bad\r\ntemper because she could not manage to get the warp right, and, besides,\r\ncarrying on an illicit trade in spirits, she was always afraid when any\r\nstranger came in.\r\n\r\n"I am--the owner of the neighbouring estates, and should like to speak\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Dear me; why, it\'s you, my honey; and I, fool, thought it was just some\r\npasser-by. Dear me, you--it\'s you, my precious," said the old woman,\r\nwith simulated tenderness in her voice.\r\n\r\n"I should like to speak to you alone," said Nekhludoff, with a glance\r\ntowards the door, where the children were standing, and behind them a\r\nwoman holding a wasted, pale baby, with a sickly smile on its face, who\r\nhad a little cap made of different bits of stuff on its head.\r\n\r\n"What are you staring at? I\'ll give it you. Just hand me my crutch," the\r\nold woman shouted to those at the door.\r\n\r\n"Shut the door, will you!" The children went away, and the woman closed\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"And I was thinking, who\'s that? And it\'s \'the master\' himself. My\r\njewel, my treasure. Just think," said the old woman, "where he has\r\ndeigned to come. Sit down here, your honour," she said, wiping the seat\r\nwith her apron. "And I was thinking what devil is it coming in, and it\'s\r\nyour honour, \'the master\' himself, the good gentleman, our benefactor.\r\nForgive me, old fool that I am; I\'m getting blind."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat down, and the old woman stood in front of him, leaning\r\nher cheek on her right hand, while the left held up the sharp elbow of\r\nher right arm.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, you have grown old, your honour; and you used to be as fresh\r\nas a daisy. And now! Cares also, I expect?"\r\n\r\n"This is what I have come about: Do you remember Katusha Maslova?"\r\n\r\n"Katerina? I should think so. Why, she is my niece. How could I help\r\nremembering; and the tears I have shed because of her. Why, I know all\r\nabout it. Eh, sir, who has not sinned before God? who has not offended\r\nagainst the Tsar? We know what youth is. You used to be drinking tea and\r\ncoffee, so the devil got hold of you. He is strong at times. What\'s to\r\nbe done? Now, if you had chucked her; but no, just see how you rewarded\r\nher, gave her a hundred roubles. And she? What has she done? Had she\r\nbut listened to me she might have lived all right. I must say the truth,\r\nthough she is my niece: that girl\'s no good. What a good place I found\r\nher! She would not submit, but abused her master. Is it for the likes\r\nof us to scold gentlefolk? Well, she was sent away. And then at the\r\nforester\'s. She might have lived there; but no, she would not."\r\n\r\n"I want to know about the child. She was confined at your house, was she\r\nnot? Where\'s the child?"\r\n\r\n"As to the child, I considered that well at the time. She was so bad\r\nI never thought she would get up again. Well, so I christened the baby\r\nquite properly, and we sent it to the Foundlings\'. Why should one let\r\nan innocent soul languish when the mother is dying? Others do like this:\r\nthey just leave the baby, don\'t feed it, and it wastes away. But, thinks\r\nI, no; I\'d rather take some trouble, and send it to the Foundlings\'.\r\nThere was money enough, so I sent it off."\r\n\r\n"Did you not get its registration number from the Foundlings\' Hospital?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there was a number, but the baby died," she said. "It died as soon\r\nas she brought it there."\r\n\r\n"Who is she?"\r\n\r\n"That same woman who used to live in Skorodno. She made a business of\r\nit. Her name was Malania. She\'s dead now. She was a wise woman. What do\r\nyou think she used to do? They\'d bring her a baby, and she\'d keep it and\r\nfeed it; and she\'d feed it until she had enough of them to take to the\r\nFoundlings\'. When she had three or four, she\'d take them all at once.\r\nShe had such a clever arrangement, a sort of big cradle--a double one\r\nshe could put them in one way or the other. It had a handle. So she\'d\r\nput four of them in, feet to feet and the heads apart, so that they\r\nshould not knock against each other. And so she took four at once. She\'d\r\nput some pap in a rag into their mouths to keep \'em silent, the pets."\r\n\r\n"Well, go on."\r\n\r\n"Well, she took Katerina\'s baby in the same way, after keeping it a\r\nfortnight, I believe. It was in her house it began to sicken."\r\n\r\n"And was it a fine baby?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Such a baby, that if you wanted a finer you could not find one. Your\r\nvery image," the old woman added, with a wink.\r\n\r\n"Why did it sicken? Was the food bad?"\r\n\r\n"Eh, what food? Only just a pretence of food. Naturally, when it\'s not\r\none\'s own child. Only enough to get it there alive. She said she\r\njust managed to get it to Moscow, and there it died. She brought a\r\ncertificate--all in order. She was such a wise woman."\r\n\r\nThat was all Nekhludoff could find out concerning his child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS OF A LANDLORD.\r\n\r\nAgain striking his head against both doors, Nekhludoff went out into the\r\nstreet, where the pink and the white boys were waiting for him. A few\r\nnewcomers were standing with them. Among the women, of whom several\r\nhad babies in their arms, was the thin woman with the baby who had the\r\npatchwork cap on its head. She held lightly in her arms the bloodless\r\ninfant, who kept strangely smiling all over its wizened little face, and\r\ncontinually moving its crooked thumbs.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff knew the smile to be one of suffering. He asked who the woman\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"It is that very Anisia I told you about," said the elder boy.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff turned to Anisia.\r\n\r\n"How do you live?" he asked. "By what means do you gain your\r\nlivelihood?"\r\n\r\n"How do I live? I go begging," said Anisia, and began to cry.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff took out his pocket-book, and gave the woman a 10-rouble\r\nnote. He had not had time to take two steps before another woman with\r\na baby caught him up, then an old woman, then another young one. All of\r\nthem spoke of their poverty, and asked for help. Nekhludoff gave them\r\nthe 60 roubles--all in small notes--which he had with him, and, terribly\r\nsad at heart, turned home, i.e., to the foreman\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe foreman met Nekhludoff with a smile, and informed him that the\r\npeasants would come to the meeting in the evening. Nekhludoff thanked\r\nhim, and went straight into the garden to stroll along the paths strewn\r\nover with the petals of apple-blossom and overgrown with weeds, and to\r\nthink over all he had seen.\r\n\r\nAt first all was quiet, but soon Nekhludoff heard from behind the\r\nforeman\'s house two angry women\'s voices interrupting each other, and\r\nnow and then the voice of the ever-smiling foreman. Nekhludoff listened.\r\n\r\n"My strength\'s at an end. What are you about, dragging the very cross\r\n[those baptized in the Russo-Greek Church always wear a cross round\r\ntheir necks] off my neck," said an angry woman\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"But she only got in for a moment," said another voice. "Give it her\r\nback, I tell you. Why do you torment the beast, and the children, too,\r\nwho want their milk?"\r\n\r\n"Pay, then, or work it off," said the foreman\'s voice.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff left the garden and entered the porch, near which stood two\r\ndishevelled women--one of them pregnant and evidently near her time.\r\nOn one of the steps of the porch, with his hands in the pockets of his\r\nholland coat, stood the foreman. When they saw the master, the women\r\nwere silent, and began arranging the kerchiefs on their heads, and the\r\nforeman took his hands out of his pockets and began to smile.\r\n\r\nThis is what had happened. From the foreman\'s words, it seemed that the\r\npeasants were in the habit of letting their calves and even their cows\r\ninto the meadow belonging to the estate. Two cows belonging to the\r\nfamilies of these two women were found in the meadow, and driven into\r\nthe yard. The foreman demanded from the women 30 copecks for each cow\r\nor two days\' work. The women, however, maintained that the cows had got\r\ninto the meadow of their own accord; that they had no money, and asked\r\nthat the cows, which had stood in the blazing sun since morning without\r\nfood, piteously lowing, should be returned to them, even if it had to be\r\non the understanding that the price should be worked off later on.\r\n\r\n"How often have I not begged of you," said the smiling foreman, looking\r\nback at Nekhludoff as if calling upon him to be a witness, "if you drive\r\nyour cattle home at noon, that you should have an eye on them?"\r\n\r\n"I only ran to my little one for a bit, and they got away."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t run away when you have undertaken to watch the cows."\r\n\r\n"And who\'s to feed the little one? You\'d not give him the breast, I\r\nsuppose?" said the other woman. "Now, if they had really damaged the\r\nmeadow, one would not take it so much to heart; but they only strayed in\r\na moment."\r\n\r\n"All the meadows are damaged," the foreman said, turning to Nekhludoff.\r\n"If I exact no penalty there will be no hay."\r\n\r\n"There, now, don\'t go sinning like that; my cows have never been caught\r\nthere before," shouted the pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n"Now that one has been caught, pay up or work it off."\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'ll work it off; only let me have the cow now, don\'t\r\ntorture her with hunger," she cried, angrily. "As it is, I have no rest\r\nday or night. Mother-in-law is ill, husband taken to drink; I\'m all\r\nalone to do all the work, and my strength\'s at an end. I wish you\'d\r\nchoke, you and your working it off."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff asked the foreman to let the women take the cows, and went\r\nback into the garden to go on thinking out his problem, but there was\r\nnothing more to think about.\r\n\r\nEverything seemed so clear to him now that he could not stop wondering\r\nhow it was that everybody did not see it, and that he himself had for\r\nsuch a long while not seen what was so clearly evident. The people were\r\ndying out, and had got used to the dying-out process, and had formed\r\nhabits of life adapted to this process: there was the great mortality\r\namong the children, the over-working of the women, the under-feeding,\r\nespecially of the aged. And so gradually had the people come to this\r\ncondition that they did not realise the full horrors of it, and did\r\nnot complain. Therefore, we consider their condition natural and as it\r\nshould be. Now it seemed as clear as daylight that the chief cause of\r\nthe people\'s great want was one that they themselves knew and always\r\npointed out, i.e., that the land which alone could feed them had been\r\ntaken from them by the landlords.\r\n\r\nAnd how evident it was that the children and the aged died because they\r\nhad no milk, and they had no milk because there was no pasture land, and\r\nno land to grow corn or make hay on. It was quite evident that all the\r\nmisery of the people or, at least by far the greater part of it, was\r\ncaused by the fact that the land which should feed them was not in their\r\nhands, but in the hands of those who, profiting by their rights to the\r\nland, live by the work of these people. The land so much needed by men\r\nwas tilled by these people, who were on the verge of starvation, so\r\nthat the corn might be sold abroad and the owners of the land might buy\r\nthemselves hats and canes, and carriages and bronzes, etc. He understood\r\nthis as clearly as he understood that horses when they have eaten all\r\nthe grass in the inclosure where they are kept will have to grow thin\r\nand starve unless they are put where they can get food off other land.\r\n\r\nThis was terrible, and must not go on. Means must be found to alter it,\r\nor at least not to take part in it. "And I will find them," he thought,\r\nas he walked up and down the path under the birch trees.\r\n\r\nIn scientific circles, Government institutions, and in the papers we\r\ntalk about the causes of the poverty among the people and the means of\r\nameliorating their condition; but we do not talk of the only sure means\r\nwhich would certainly lighten their condition, i.e., giving back to them\r\nthe land they need so much.\r\n\r\nHenry George\'s fundamental position recurred vividly to his mind and how\r\nhe had once been carried away by it, and he was surprised that he could\r\nhave forgotten it. The earth cannot be any one\'s property; it cannot be\r\nbought or sold any more than water, air, or sunshine. All have an equal\r\nright to the advantages it gives to men. And now he knew why he had felt\r\nashamed to remember the transaction at Kousminski. He had been deceiving\r\nhimself. He knew that no man could have a right to own land, yet he had\r\naccepted this right as his, and had given the peasants something which,\r\nin the depth of his heart, he knew he had no right to. Now he would not\r\nact in this way, and would alter the arrangement in Kousminski also. And\r\nhe formed a project in his mind to let the land to the peasants, and to\r\nacknowledge the rent they paid for it to be their property, to be kept\r\nto pay the taxes and for communal uses. This was, of course, not the\r\nsingle-tax system, still it was as near an approach to it as could be\r\nhad under existing circumstances. His chief consideration, however, was\r\nthat in this way he would no longer profit by the possession of landed\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the house the foreman, with a specially pleasant\r\nsmile, asked him if he would not have his dinner now, expressing the\r\nfear that the feast his wife was preparing, with the help of the girl\r\nwith the earrings, might be overdone.\r\n\r\nThe table was covered with a coarse, unbleached cloth and an embroidered\r\ntowel was laid on it in lieu of a napkin. A vieux-saxe soup tureen with\r\na broken handle stood on the table, full of potato soup, the stock made\r\nof the fowl that had put out and drawn in his black leg, and was now\r\ncut, or rather chopped, in pieces, which were here and there covered\r\nwith hairs. After the soup more of the same fowl with the hairs was\r\nserved roasted, and then curd pasties, very greasy, and with a great\r\ndeal of sugar. Little appetising as all this was, Nekhludoff hardly\r\nnoticed what he was eating; he was occupied with the thought which had\r\nin a moment dispersed the sadness with which he had returned from the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe foreman\'s wife kept looking in at the door, whilst the frightened\r\nmaid with the earrings brought in the dishes; and the foreman smiled\r\nmore and more joyfully, priding himself on his wife\'s culinary skill.\r\nAfter dinner, Nekhludoff succeeded, with some trouble, in making the\r\nforeman sit down. In order to revise his own thoughts, and to express\r\nthem to some one, he explained his project of letting the land to the\r\npeasants, and asked the foreman for his opinion. The foreman, smiling\r\nas if he had thought all this himself long ago, and was very pleased\r\nto hear it, did not really understand it at all. This was not because\r\nNekhludoff did not express himself clearly, but because according to\r\nthis project it turned out that Nekhludoff was giving up his own\r\nprofit for the profit of others, and the thought that every one is only\r\nconcerned about his own profit, to the harm of others, was so deeply\r\nrooted in the foreman\'s conceptions that he imagined he did not\r\nunderstand something when Nekhludoff said that all the income from the\r\nland must be placed to form the communal capital of the peasants.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see; then you, of course, will receive the percentages from that\r\ncapital," said the foreman, brightening up.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! no. Don\'t you see, I am giving up the land altogether."\r\n\r\n"But then you will not get any income," said the foreman, smiling no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am going to give it up."\r\n\r\nThe foreman sighed heavily, and then began smiling again. Now he\r\nunderstood. He understood that Nekhludoff was not quite normal, and\r\nat once began to consider how he himself could profit by Nekhludoff\'s\r\nproject of giving up the land, and tried to see this project in such a\r\nway that he might reap some advantage from it. But when he saw that this\r\nwas impossible he grew sorrowful, and the project ceased to interest\r\nhim, and he continued to smile only in order to please the master.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the foreman did not understand him, Nekhludoff let him go\r\nand sat down by the window-sill, that was all cut about and inked over,\r\nand began to put his project down on paper.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down behind the limes, that were covered with fresh green,\r\nand the mosquitoes swarmed in, stinging Nekhludoff. Just as he finished\r\nhis notes, he heard the lowing of cattle and the creaking of opening\r\ngates from the village, and the voices of the peasants gathering\r\ntogether for the meeting. He told the foreman not to call the peasants\r\nup to the office, as he meant to go into the village himself and meet\r\nthe men where they would assemble. Having hurriedly drank a cup of tea\r\noffered him by the foreman, Nekhludoff went to the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DISINHERITED.\r\n\r\nFrom the crowd assembled in front of the house of the village elder\r\ncame the sound of voices; but as soon as Nekhludoff came up the talking\r\nceased, and all the peasants took off their caps, just as those in\r\nKousminski had done. The peasants here were of a much poorer class than\r\nthose in Kousminski. The men wore shoes made of bark and homespun shirts\r\nand coats. Some had come straight from their work in their shirts and\r\nwith bare feet.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff made an effort, and began his speech by telling the peasants\r\nof his intention to give up his land to them altogether. The peasants\r\nwere silent, and the expression on their faces did not undergo any\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n"Because I hold," said Nekhludoff, "and believe that every one has a\r\nright to the use of the land."\r\n\r\n"That\'s certain. That\'s so, exactly," said several voices.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went on to say that the revenue from the land ought to be\r\ndivided among all, and that he would therefore suggest that they\r\nshould rent the land at a price fixed by themselves, the rent to form\r\na communal fund for their own use. Words of approval and agreement were\r\nstill to be heard, but the serious faces of the peasants grew still more\r\nserious, and the eyes that had been fixed on the gentleman dropped, as\r\nif they were unwilling to put him to shame by letting him see that every\r\none had understood his trick, and that no one would be deceived by him.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff spoke clearly, and the peasants were intelligent, but they\r\ndid not and could not understand him, for the same reason that the\r\nforeman had so long been unable to understand him.\r\n\r\nThey were fully convinced that it is natural for every man to consider\r\nhis own interest. The experience of many generations had proved to them\r\nthat the landlords always considered their own interest to the detriment\r\nof the peasants. Therefore, if a landlord called them to a meeting and\r\nmade them some kind of a new offer, it could evidently only be in order\r\nto swindle them more cunningly than before.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what are you willing to rent the land at?" asked\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"How can we fix a price? We cannot do it. The land is yours, and the\r\npower is in your hands," answered some voices from among the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all. You will yourselves have the use of the money for\r\ncommunal purposes."\r\n\r\n"We cannot do it; the commune is one thing, and this is another."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you understand?" said the foreman, with a smile (he had followed\r\nNekhludoff to the meeting), "the Prince is letting the land to you\r\nfor money, and is giving you the money back to form a capital for the\r\ncommune."\r\n\r\n"We understand very well," said a cross, toothless old man, without\r\nraising his eyes. "Something like a bank; we should have to pay at a\r\nfixed time. We do not wish it; it is hard enough as it is, and that\r\nwould ruin us completely."\r\n\r\n"That\'s no go. We prefer to go on the old way," began several\r\ndissatisfied, and even rude, voices.\r\n\r\nThe refusals grew very vehement when Nekhludoff mentioned that he would\r\ndraw up an agreement which would have to be signed by him and by them.\r\n\r\n"Why sign? We shall go on working as we have done hitherto. What is all\r\nthis for? We are ignorant men."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t agree, because this sort of thing is not what we have been\r\nused to. As it was, so let it continue to be. Only the seeds we should\r\nlike to withdraw."\r\n\r\nThis meant that under the present arrangement the seeds had to be\r\nprovided by the peasants, and they wanted the landlord to provide them.\r\n\r\n"Then am I to understand that you refuse to accept the land?" Nekhludoff\r\nasked, addressing a middle-aged, barefooted peasant, with a tattered\r\ncoat, and a bright look on his face, who was holding his worn cap\r\nwith his left hand, in a peculiarly straight position, in the same way\r\nsoldiers hold theirs when commanded to take them off.\r\n\r\n"Just so," said this peasant, who had evidently not yet rid himself of\r\nthe military hypnotism he had been subjected to while serving his time.\r\n\r\n"It means that you have sufficient land," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, we have not," said the ex-soldier, with an artificially\r\npleased look, carefully holding his tattered cap in front of him, as if\r\noffering it to any one who liked to make use of it.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, you\'d better think over what I have said." Nekhludoff\r\nspoke with surprise, and again repeated his offer.\r\n\r\n"We have no need to think about it; as we have said, so it will be,"\r\nangrily muttered the morose, toothless old man.\r\n\r\n"I shall remain here another day, and if you change your minds, send to\r\nlet me know."\r\n\r\nThe peasants gave no answer.\r\n\r\nSo Nekhludoff did not succeed in arriving at any result from this\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\n"If I might make a remark, Prince," said the foreman, when they got\r\nhome, "you will never come to any agreement with them; they are so\r\nobstinate. At a meeting these people just stick in one place, and there\r\nis no moving them. It is because they are frightened of everything. Why,\r\nthese very peasants--say that white-haired one, or the dark one, who\r\nwere refusing, are intelligent peasants. When one of them comes to the\r\noffice and one makes him sit down to cup of tea it\'s like in the Palace\r\nof Wisdom--he is quite diplomatist," said the foreman, smiling; "he will\r\nconsider everything rightly. At a meeting it\'s a different man--he keeps\r\nrepeating one and the same . . ."\r\n\r\n"Well, could not some of the more intelligent men be asked to come\r\nhere?" said Nekhludoff. "I would carefully explain it to them."\r\n\r\n"That can be done," said the smiling foreman.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, would you mind calling them here to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly I will," said the foreman, and smiled still more\r\njoyfully. "I shall call them to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Just hear him; he\'s not artful, not he," said a blackhaired peasant,\r\nwith an unkempt beard, as he sat jolting from side to side on a well-fed\r\nmare, addressing an old man in a torn coat who rode by his side. The two\r\nmen were driving a herd of the peasants\' horses to graze in the night,\r\nalongside the highroad and secretly, in the landlord\'s forest.\r\n\r\n"Give you the land for nothing--you need only sign--have they not\r\ndone the likes of us often enough? No, my friend, none of your humbug.\r\nNowadays we have a little sense," he added, and began shouting at a colt\r\nthat had strayed.\r\n\r\nHe stopped his horse and looked round, but the colt had not remained\r\nbehind; it had gone into the meadow by the roadside. "Bother that son\r\nof a Turk; he\'s taken to getting into the landowner\'s meadows," said the\r\ndark peasant with the unkempt beard, hearing the cracking of the sorrel\r\nstalks that the neighing colt was galloping over as he came running back\r\nfrom the scented meadow.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear the cracking? We\'ll have to send the women folk to weed\r\nthe meadow when there\'s a holiday," said the thin peasant with the torn\r\ncoat, "or else we\'ll blunt our scythes."\r\n\r\n"Sign," he says. The unkempt man continued giving his opinion of the\r\nlandlord\'s speech. "\'Sign,\' indeed, and let him swallow you up."\r\n\r\n"That\'s certain," answered the old man. And then they were silent, and\r\nthe tramping of the horses\' feet along the highroad was the only sound\r\nto be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGOD\'S PEACE IN THE HEART.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff returned he found that the office had been arranged as\r\na bedroom for him. A high bedstead, with a feather bed and two large\r\npillows, had been placed in the room. The bed was covered with a dark\r\nred doublebedded silk quilt, which was elaborately and finely quilted,\r\nand very stiff. It evidently belonged to the trousseau of the foreman\'s\r\nwife. The foreman offered Nekhludoff the remains of the dinner, which\r\nthe latter refused, and, excusing himself for the poorness of the fare\r\nand the accommodation, he left Nekhludoff alone.\r\n\r\nThe peasants\' refusal did not at all bother Nekhludoff. On the contrary,\r\nthough at Kousminski his offer had been accepted and he had even been\r\nthanked for it, and here he was met with suspicion and even enmity, he\r\nfelt contented and joyful.\r\n\r\nIt was close and dirty in the office. Nekhludoff went out into the yard,\r\nand was going into the garden, but he remembered: that night, the window\r\nof the maid-servant\'s room, the side porch, and he felt uncomfortable,\r\nand did not like to pass the spot desecrated by guilty memories. He\r\nsat down on the doorstep, and breathing in the warm air, balmy with the\r\nstrong scent of fresh birch leaves, he sat for a long time looking into\r\nthe dark garden and listening to the mill, the nightingales, and some\r\nother bird that whistled monotonously in the bush close by. The light\r\ndisappeared from the foreman\'s window; in the cast, behind the barn,\r\nappeared the light of the rising moon, and sheet lightning began to\r\nlight up the dilapidated house, and the blooming, over-grown garden more\r\nand more frequently. It began to thunder in the distance, and a black\r\ncloud spread over one-third of the sky. The nightingales and the other\r\nbirds were silent. Above the murmur of the water from the mill came the\r\ncackling of geese, and then in the village and in the foreman\'s yard\r\nthe first cocks began to crow earlier than usual, as they do on warm,\r\nthundery nights. There is a saying that if the cocks crow early the\r\nnight will be a merry one. For Nekhludoff the night was more than merry;\r\nit was a happy, joyful night. Imagination renewed the impressions of\r\nthat happy summer which he had spent here as an innocent lad, and he\r\nfelt himself as he had been not only at that but at all the best moments\r\nof his life. He not only remembered but felt as he had felt when, at\r\nthe age of 14, he prayed that God would show him the truth; or when as\r\na child he had wept on his mother\'s lap, when parting from her, and\r\npromising to be always good, and never give her pain; he felt as he did\r\nwhen he and Nikolenka Irtenieff resolved always to support each other in\r\nliving a good life and to try to make everybody happy.\r\n\r\nHe remembered how he had been tempted in Kousminski, so that he had\r\nbegun to regret the house and the forest and the farm and the land, and\r\nhe asked himself if he regretted them now, and it even seemed strange to\r\nthink that he could regret them. He remembered all he had seen to-day;\r\nthe woman with the children, and without her husband, who was in prison\r\nfor having cut down trees in his (Nekhludoff\'s) forest, and the terrible\r\nMatrona, who considered, or at least talked as if she considered,\r\nthat women of her position must give themselves to the gentlefolk; he\r\nremembered her relation to the babies, the way in which they were taken\r\nto the Foundlings\' Hospital, and the unfortunate, smiling, wizened\r\nbaby with the patchwork cap, dying of starvation. And then he suddenly\r\nremembered the prison, the shaved heads, the cells, the disgusting\r\nsmells, the chains, and, by the side of it all, the madly lavish city\r\nlift of the rich, himself included.\r\n\r\nThe bright moon, now almost full, rose above the barn. Dark shadows fell\r\nacross the yard, and the iron roof of the ruined house shone bright.\r\nAs if unwilling to waste this light, the nightingales again began their\r\ntrills.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff called to mind how he had begun to consider his life in\r\nthe garden of Kousminski when deciding what he was going to do, and\r\nremembered how confused he had become, how he could not arrive at any\r\ndecision, how many difficulties each question had presented. He asked\r\nhimself these questions now, and was surprised how simple it all was. It\r\nwas simple because he was not thinking now of what would be the results\r\nfor himself, but only thought of what he had to do. And, strange to say,\r\nwhat he had to do for himself he could not decide, but what he had to do\r\nfor others he knew without any doubt. He had no doubt that he must\r\nnot leave Katusha, but go on helping her. He had no doubt that he must\r\nstudy, investigate, clear up, understand all this business concerning\r\njudgment and punishment, which he felt he saw differently to other\r\npeople. What would result from it all he did not know, but he knew for\r\ncertain that he must do it. And this firm assurance gave him joy.\r\n\r\nThe black cloud had spread all over the sky; the lightning flashed\r\nvividly across the yard and the old house with its tumble-down porches,\r\nthe thunder growled overhead. All the birds were silent, but the leaves\r\nrustled and the wind reached the step where Nekhludoff stood and played\r\nwith his hair. One drop came down, then another; then they came drumming\r\non the dock leaves and on the iron of the roof, and all the air was\r\nfilled by a bright flash, and before Nekhludoff could count three a\r\nfearful crash sounded over head and spread pealing all over the sky.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went in.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," he thought. "The work that our life accomplishes, the whole\r\nof this work, the meaning of it is not, nor can be, intelligible to\r\nme. What were my aunts for? Why did Nikolenka Irtenieff die? Why am\r\nI living? What was Katusha for? And my madness? Why that war? Why my\r\nsubsequent lawless life? To understand it, to understand the whole\r\nof the Master\'s will is not in my power. But to do His will, that is\r\nwritten down in my conscience, is in my power; that I know for certain.\r\nAnd when I am fulfilling it I have sureness and peace."\r\n\r\nThe rain came down in torrents and rushed from the roof into a tub\r\nbeneath; the lightning lit up the house and yard less frequently.\r\nNekhludoff went into his room, undressed, and lay down, not without\r\nfear of the bugs, whose presence the dirty, torn wall-papers made him\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to feel one\'s self not the master but a servant," he thought, and\r\nrejoiced at the thought. His fears were not vain. Hardly had he put out\r\nhis candle when the vermin attacked and stung him. "To give up the land\r\nand go to Siberia. Fleas, bugs, dirt! Ah, well; if it must be borne, I\r\nshall bear it." But, in spite of the best of intentions, he could not\r\nbear it, and sat down by the open window and gazed with admiration at\r\nthe retreating clouds and the reappearing moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE LAND SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nIt was morning before Nekhludoff could fall asleep, and therefore he\r\nwoke up late. At noon seven men, chosen from among the peasants at\r\nthe foreman\'s invitation, came into the orchard, where the foreman\r\nhad arranged a table and benches by digging posts into the ground,\r\nand fixing boards on the top, under the apple trees. It took some time\r\nbefore the peasants could be persuaded to put on their caps and to sit\r\ndown on the benches. Especially firm was the ex-soldier, who to-day had\r\nbark shoes on. He stood erect, holding his cap as they do at\r\nfunerals, according to military regulation. When one of them, a\r\nrespectable-looking, broad-shouldered old man, with a curly, grizzly\r\nbeard like that of Michael Angelo\'s "Moses," and grey hair that curled\r\nround the brown, bald forehead, put on his big cap, and, wrapping his\r\ncoat round him, got in behind the table and sat down, the rest followed\r\nhis example. When all had taken their places Nekhludoff sat down\r\nopposite them, and leaning on the table over the paper on which he had\r\ndrawn up his project, he began explaining it.\r\n\r\nWhether it was that there were fewer present, or that he was occupied\r\nwith the business in hand and not with himself, anyhow, this\r\ntime Nekhludoff felt no confusion. He involuntarily addressed the\r\nbroad-shouldered old man with white ringlets in his grizzly beard,\r\nexpecting approbation or objections from him. But Nekhludoff\'s\r\nconjecture was wrong. The respectable-looking old patriarch, though he\r\nnodded his handsome head approvingly or shook it, and frowned when the\r\nothers raised an objection, evidently understood with great difficulty,\r\nand only when the others repeated what Nekhludoff had said in their own\r\nwords. A little, almost beardless old fellow, blind in one eye, who sat\r\nby the side of the patriarch, and had a patched nankeen coat and old\r\nboots on, and, as Nekhludoff found out later, was an oven-builder,\r\nunderstood much better. This man moved his brows quickly, attending to\r\nNekhludoff\'s words with an effort, and at once repeated them in his\r\nown way. An old, thick-set man with a white beard and intelligent eyes\r\nunderstood as quickly, and took every opportunity to put in an ironical\r\njoke, clearly wishing to show off. The ex-soldier seemed also to\r\nunderstand matters, but got mixed, being used to senseless soldiers\'\r\ntalk. A tall man with a small beard, a long nose, and a bass voice, who\r\nwore clean, home-made clothes and new bark-plaited shoes, seemed to be\r\nthe one most seriously interested. This man spoke only when there\r\nwas need of it. The two other old men, the same toothless one who\r\nhad shouted a distinct refusal at the meeting the day before to every\r\nproposal of Nekhludoff\'s, and a tall, white lame old man with a kind\r\nface, his thin legs tightly wrapped round with strips of linen, said\r\nlittle, though they listened attentively. First of all Nekhludoff\r\nexplained his views in regard to personal property in land. "The land,\r\naccording to my idea, can neither be bought nor sold, because if it\r\ncould be, he who has got the money could buy it all, and exact anything\r\nhe liked for the use of the land from those who have none."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said the long-nosed man, in a deep bass.\r\n\r\n"Just so," said the ex-soldier.\r\n\r\n"A woman gathers a little grass for her cow; she\'s caught and\r\nimprisoned," said the white-bearded old man.\r\n\r\n"Our own land is five versts away, and as to renting any it\'s\r\nimpossible; the price is raised so high that it won\'t pay," added the\r\ncross, toothless old man. "They twist us into ropes, worse than during\r\nserfdom."\r\n\r\n"I think as you do, and I count it a sin to possess land, so I wish to\r\ngive it away," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a good thing," said the old man, with curls like Angelo\'s\r\n"Moses," evidently thinking that Nekhludoff meant to let the land.\r\n\r\n"I have come here because I no longer wish to possess any land, and now\r\nwe must consider the best way of dividing it."\r\n\r\n"Just give it to the peasants, that\'s all," said the cross, toothless\r\nold man.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was abashed for a moment, feeling a suspicion of his not\r\nbeing honest in these words, but he instantly recovered, and made use of\r\nthe remark, in order to express what was in his mind, in reply.\r\n\r\n"I should be glad to give it them," he said, "but to whom, and how?\r\nTo which of the peasants? Why, to your commune, and not to that of\r\nDeminsk." (That was the name of a neighbouring village with very little\r\nland.) All were silent. Then the ex-soldier said, "Just so."\r\n\r\n"Now, then, tell me how would you divide the land among the peasants if\r\nyou had to do it?" said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"We should divide it up equally, so much for every man," said the\r\noven-builder, quickly raising and lowering his brows.\r\n\r\n"How else? Of course, so much per man," said the good natured lame man\r\nwith the white strips of linen round his legs.\r\n\r\nEvery one confirmed this statement, considering it satisfactory.\r\n\r\n"So much per man? Then are the servants attached to the house also to\r\nhave a share?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said the ex-soldier, trying to appear bold and merry. But the\r\ntall, reasonable man would not agree with him.\r\n\r\n"If one is to divide, all must share alike," he said, in his deep bass,\r\nafter a little consideration.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be done," said Nekhludoff, who had already prepared his reply.\r\n"If all are to share alike, then those who do not work themselves--do\r\nnot plough--will sell their shares to the rich. The rich will again get\r\nat the land. Those who live by working the land will multiply, and land\r\nwill again be scarce. Then the rich will again get those who need land\r\ninto their power."\r\n\r\n"Just so," quickly said the ex-soldier.\r\n\r\n"Forbid to sell the land; let only him who ploughs it have it," angrily\r\ninterrupted the oven-builder.\r\n\r\nTo this Nekhludoff replied that it was impossible to know who was\r\nploughing for himself and who for another.\r\n\r\nThe tall, reasonable man proposed that an arrangement be made so that\r\nthey should all plough communally, and those who ploughed should get the\r\nproduce and those who did not should get nothing.\r\n\r\nTo this communistic project Nekhludoff had also an answer ready. He said\r\nthat for such an arrangement it would be necessary that all should have\r\nploughs, and that all the horses should be alike, so that none should\r\nbe left behind, and that ploughs and horses and all the implements would\r\nhave to be communal property, and that in order to get that, all the\r\npeople would have to agree.\r\n\r\n"Our people could not be made to agree in a lifetime," said the cross\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n"We should have regular fights," said the white-bearded old man with the\r\nlaughing eyes. "So that the thing is not as simple as it looks,"\r\nsaid Nekhludoff, "and this is a thing not only we but many have been\r\nconsidering. There is an American, Henry George. This is what he has\r\nthought out, and I agree with him."\r\n\r\n"Why, you are the master, and you give it as you like. What\'s it to you?\r\nThe power is yours," said the cross old man.\r\n\r\nThis confused Nekhludoff, but he was pleased to see that not he alone\r\nwas dissatisfied with this interruption.\r\n\r\n"You wait a bit, Uncle Simon; let him tell us about it," said the\r\nreasonable man, in his imposing bass.\r\n\r\nThis emboldened Nekhludoff, and he began to explain Henry George\'s\r\nsingle-tax system "The earth is no man\'s; it is God\'s," he began.\r\n\r\n"Just so; that it is," several voices replied.\r\n\r\n"The land is common to all. All have the same right to it, but there is\r\ngood land and bad land, and every one would like to take the good land.\r\nHow is one to do in order to get it justly divided? In this way: he that\r\nwill use the good land must pay those who have got no land the value of\r\nthe land he uses," Nekhludoff went on, answering his own question. "As\r\nit would be difficult to say who should pay whom, and money is needed\r\nfor communal use, it should be arranged that he who uses the good land\r\nshould pay the amount of the value of his land to the commune for its\r\nneeds. Then every one would share equally. If you want to use land pay\r\nfor it--more for the good, less for the bad land. If you do not wish to\r\nuse land, don\'t pay anything, and those who use the land will pay the\r\ntaxes and the communal expenses for you."\r\n\r\n"Well, he had a head, this George," said the oven-builder, moving his\r\nbrows. "He who has good land must pay more."\r\n\r\n"If only the payment is according to our strength," said the tall man\r\nwith the bass voice, evidently foreseeing how the matter would end.\r\n\r\n"The payment should be not too high and not too low. If it is too high\r\nit will not get paid, and there will be a loss; and if it is too low it\r\nwill be bought and sold. There would be a trading in land. This is what\r\nI wished to arrange among you here."\r\n\r\n"That is just, that is right; yes, that would do," said the peasants.\r\n\r\n"He has a head, this George," said the broad-shouldered old man with the\r\ncurls. "See what he has invented."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, how would it be if I wished to take some land?" asked the\r\nsmiling foreman.\r\n\r\n"If there is an allotment to spare, take it and work it," said\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"What do you want it for? You have sufficient as it is," said the old\r\nman with the laughing eyes.\r\n\r\nWith this the conference ended.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff repeated his offer, and advised the men to talk it over with\r\nthe rest of the commune and to return with the answer.\r\n\r\nThe peasants said they would talk it over and bring an answer, and left\r\nin a state of excitement. Their loud talk was audible as they went along\r\nthe road, and up to late in the night the sound of voices came along the\r\nriver from the village.\r\n\r\nThe next day the peasants did not go to work, but spent it in\r\nconsidering the landlord\'s offer. The commune was divided into two\r\nparties--one which regarded the offer as a profitable one to themselves\r\nand saw no danger in agreeing with it, and another which suspected and\r\nfeared the offer it did not understand. On the third day, however, all\r\nagreed, and some were sent to Nekhludoff to accept his offer. They were\r\ninfluenced in their decision by the explanation some of the old men gave\r\nof the landlord\'s conduct, which did away with all fear of deceit. They\r\nthought the gentleman had begun to consider his soul, and was acting as\r\nhe did for its salvation. The alms which Nekhludoff had given away while\r\nin Panovo made his explanation seem likely. The fact that Nekhludoff\r\nhad never before been face to face with such great poverty and so bare\r\na life as the peasants had come to in this place, and was so appalled\r\nby it, made him give away money in charity, though he knew that this was\r\nnot reasonable. He could not help giving the money, of which he now had\r\na great deal, having received a large sum for the forest he had sold\r\nthe year before, and also the hand money for the implements and stock in\r\nKousminski. As soon as it was known that the master was giving money in\r\ncharity, crowds of people, chiefly women, began to come to ask him for\r\nhelp. He did not in the least know how to deal with them, how to decide,\r\nhow much, and whom to give to. He felt that to refuse to give money, of\r\nwhich he had a great deal, to poor people was impossible, yet to give\r\ncasually to those who asked was not wise. The last day he spent in\r\nPanovo, Nekhludoff looked over the things left in his aunts\' house, and\r\nin the bottom drawer of the mahogany wardrobe, with the brass lions\'\r\nheads with rings through them, he found many letters, and amongst them a\r\nphotograph of a group, consisting of his aunts, Sophia Ivanovna and Mary\r\nIvanovna, a student, and Katusha. Of all the things in the house he took\r\nonly the letters and the photograph. The rest he left to the miller who,\r\nat the smiling foreman\'s recommendation, had bought the house and all it\r\ncontained, to be taken down and carried away, at one-tenth of the real\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nRecalling the feeling of regret at the loss of his property which he had\r\nfelt in Kousminski, Nekhludoff was surprised how he could have felt this\r\nregret. Now he felt nothing but unceasing joy at the deliverance, and\r\na sensation of newness something like that which a traveller must\r\nexperience when discovering new countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF RETURNS TO TOWN.\r\n\r\nThe town struck Nekhludoff in a new and peculiar light on his return.\r\nHe came back in the evening, when the gas was lit, and drove from\r\nthe railway station to his house, where the rooms still smelt of\r\nnaphthaline. Agraphena Petrovna and Corney were both feeling tired and\r\ndissatisfied, and had even had a quarrel over those things that seemed\r\nmade only to be aired and packed away. Nekhludoff\'s room was empty, but\r\nnot in order, and the way to it was blocked up with boxes, so that his\r\narrival evidently hindered the business which, owing to a curious kind\r\nof inertia, was going on in this house. The evident folly of these\r\nproceedings, in which he had once taken part, was so distasteful to\r\nNekhludoff after the impressions the misery of the life of the peasants\r\nhad made on him, that he decided to go to a hotel the next day, leaving\r\nAgraphena Petrovna to put away the things as she thought fit until his\r\nsister should come and finally dispose of everything in the house.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff left home early and chose a couple of rooms in a very modest\r\nand not particularly clean lodging-house within easy reach of the\r\nprison, and, having given orders that some of his things should be sent\r\nthere, he went to see the advocate. It was cold out of doors. After some\r\nrainy and stormy weather it had turned out cold, as it often does in\r\nspring. It was so cold that Nekhludoff felt quite chilly in his light\r\novercoat, and walked fast hoping to get warmer. His mind was filled\r\nwith thoughts of the peasants, the women, children, old men, and all the\r\npoverty and weariness which he seemed to have seen for the first time,\r\nespecially the smiling, old-faced infant writhing with his calfless\r\nlittle legs, and he could not help contrasting what was going on in the\r\ntown. Passing by the butchers\', fishmongers\', and clothiers\' shops, he\r\nwas struck, as if he saw them for the first time, by the appearance\r\nof the clean, well-fed shopkeepers, like whom you could not find one\r\npeasant in the country. These men were apparently convinced that the\r\npains they took to deceive the people who did not know much about their\r\ngoods was not a useless but rather an important business. The coachmen\r\nwith their broad hips and rows of buttons down their sides, and the\r\ndoor-keepers with gold cords on their caps, the servant-girls with their\r\naprons and curly fringes, and especially the smart isvostchiks with\r\nthe nape of their necks clean shaved, as they sat lolling back in their\r\ntraps, and examined the passers-by with dissolute and contemptuous\r\nair, looked well fed. In all these people Nekhludoff could not now help\r\nseeing some of these very peasants who had been driven into the town by\r\nlack of land. Some of the peasants driven to the town had found means\r\nof profiting by the conditions of town life and had become like the\r\ngentlefolk and were pleased with their position; others were in a worse\r\nposition than they had been in the country and were more to be pitied\r\nthan the country people.\r\n\r\nSuch seemed the bootmakers Nekhludoff saw in the cellar, the pale,\r\ndishevelled washerwomen with their thin, bare, arms ironing at an open\r\nwindow, out of which streamed soapy steam; such the two house-painters\r\nwith their aprons, stockingless feet, all bespattered and smeared with\r\npaint, whom Nekhludoff met--their weak, brown arms bared to above the\r\nelbows--carrying a pailful of paint, and quarrelling with each other.\r\nTheir faces looked haggard and cross. The dark faces of the carters\r\njolting along in their carts bore the same expression, and so did the\r\nfaces of the tattered men and women who stood begging at the street\r\ncorners. The same kind of faces were to be seen at the open, windows of\r\nthe eating-houses which Nekhludoff passed. By the dirty tables on which\r\nstood tea things and bottles, and between which waiters dressed in white\r\nshirts were rushing hither and thither, sat shouting and singing red,\r\nperspiring men with stupefied faces. One sat by the window with\r\nlifted brows and pouting lips and fixed eyes as if trying to remember\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n"And why are they all gathered here?" Nekhludoff thought, breathing\r\nin together with the dust which the cold wind blew towards him the air\r\nfilled with the smell of rank oil and fresh paint.\r\n\r\nIn one street he met a row of carts loaded with something made of iron,\r\nthat rattled so on the uneven pavement that it made his ears and head\r\nache. He started walking still faster in order to pass the row of carts,\r\nwhen he heard himself called by name. He stopped and saw an officer with\r\nsharp pointed moustaches and shining face who sat in the trap of a swell\r\nisvostchik and waved his hand in a friendly manner, his smile disclosing\r\nunusually long, white teeth.\r\n\r\n"Nekhludoff! Can it be you?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff\'s first feeling was one of pleasure. "Ah, Schonbock!" he\r\nexclaimed joyfully; but he knew the next moment that there was nothing\r\nto be joyful about.\r\n\r\nThis was that Schonbock who had been in the house of Nekhludoff\'s aunts\r\nthat day, and whom Nekhludoff had quite lost out of sight, but about\r\nwhom he had heard that in spite of his debts he had somehow managed to\r\nremain in the cavalry, and by some means or other still kept his place\r\namong the rich. His gay, contented appearance corroborated this report.\r\n\r\n"What a good thing that I have caught you. There is no one in town. Ah,\r\nold fellow; you have grown old," he said, getting out of the trap and\r\nmoving his shoulders about. "I only knew you by your walk. Look here, we\r\nmust dine together. Is there any place where they feed one decently?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I can spare the time," Nekhludoff answered, thinking only\r\nof how he could best get rid of his companion without hurting him.\r\n\r\n"And what has brought you here?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Business, old fellow. Guardianship business. I am a guardian now. I am\r\nmanaging Samanoff\'s affairs--the millionaire, you know. He has softening\r\nof the brain, and he\'s got fifty-four thousand desiatins of land,"\r\nhe said, with peculiar pride, as if he had himself made all these\r\ndesiatins. "The affairs were terribly neglected. All the land was let\r\nto the peasants. They did not pay anything. There were more than eighty\r\nthousand roubles debts. I changed it all in one year, and have got 70\r\nper cent. more out of it. What do you think of that?" he asked proudly.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff remembered having heard that this Schonbock, just because, he\r\nhad spent all he had, had attained by some special influence the post of\r\nguardian to a rich old man who was squandering his property--and was now\r\nevidently living by this guardianship.\r\n\r\n"How am I to get rid of him without offending him?" thought Nekhludoff,\r\nlooking at this full, shiny face with the stiffened moustache and\r\nlistening to his friendly, good-humoured chatter about where one gets\r\nfed best, and his bragging about his doings as a guardian.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, where do we dine?"\r\n\r\n"Really, I have no time to spare," said Nekhludoff, glancing at his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n"Then, look here. To-night, at the races--will you be there?"\r\n\r\n"No, I shall not be there."\r\n\r\n"Do come. I have none of my own now, but I back Grisha\'s horses. You\r\nremember; he has a fine stud. You\'ll come, won\'t you? And we\'ll have\r\nsome supper together."\r\n\r\n"No, I cannot have supper with you either," said Nekhludoff with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s too bad! And where are you off to now? Shall I give you a\r\nlift?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to see an advocate, close to here round the corner."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course. You have got something to do with the prisons--have\r\nturned into a prisoners\' mediator, I hear," said Schonbock, laughing.\r\n"The Korchagins told me. They have left town already. What does it all\r\nmean? Tell me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, it is quite true," Nekhludoff answered; "but I cannot tell\r\nyou about it in the street."\r\n\r\n"Of course; you always were a crank. But you will come to the races?"\r\n\r\n"No. I neither can nor wish to come. Please do not be angry with me."\r\n\r\n"Angry? Dear me, no. Where do you live?" And suddenly his face became\r\nserious, his eyes fixed, and he drew up his brows. He seemed to be\r\ntrying to remember something, and Nekhludoff noticed the same dull\r\nexpression as that of the man with the raised brows and pouting lips\r\nwhom he had seen at the window of the eating-house.\r\n\r\n"How cold it is! Is it not? Have you got the parcels?" said Schonbock,\r\nturning to the isvostchik.\r\n\r\n"All right. Good-bye. I am very glad indeed to have met you," and\r\nwarmly pressing Nekhludoff\'s hand, he jumped into the trap and waved\r\nhis white-gloved hand in front of his shiny face, with his usual smile,\r\nshowing his exceptionally white teeth.\r\n\r\n"Can I have also been like that?" Nekhludoff thought, as he continued\r\nhis way to the advocate\'s. "Yes, I wished to be like that, though I was\r\nnot quite like it. And I thought of living my life in that way."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAN ADVOCATE\'S VIEWS ON JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was admitted by the advocate before his turn. The advocate at\r\nonce commenced to talk about the Menshoffs\' case, which he had read with\r\nindignation at the inconsistency of the accusation.\r\n\r\n"This case is perfectly revolting," he said; "it is very likely that\r\nthe owner himself set fire to the building in order to get the insurance\r\nmoney, and the chief thing is that there is no evidence to prove the\r\nMenshoffs\' guilt. There are no proofs whatever. It is all owing to the\r\nspecial zeal of the examining magistrate and the carelessness of the\r\nprosecutor. If they are tried here, and not in a provincial court, I\r\nguarantee that they will be acquitted, and I shall charge nothing.\r\nNow then, the next case, that of Theodosia Birukoff. The appeal to the\r\nEmperor is written. If you go to Petersburg, you\'d better take it with\r\nyou, and hand it in yourself, with a request of your own, or else they\r\nwill only make a few inquiries, and nothing will come of it. You must\r\ntry and get at some of the influential members of the Appeal Committee."\r\n\r\n"Well, is this all?"\r\n\r\n"No; here I have a letter . . . I see you have turned into a pipe--a\r\nspout through which all the complaints of the prison are poured," said\r\nthe advocate, with a smile. "It is too much; you\'ll not be able to\r\nmanage it."\r\n\r\n"No, but this is a striking case," said Nekhludoff, and gave a brief\r\noutline of the case of a peasant who began to read the Gospels to the\r\npeasants in the village, and to discuss them with his friends. The\r\npriests regarded this as a crime and informed the authorities. The\r\nmagistrate examined him and the public prosecutor drew up an act of\r\nindictment, and the law courts committed him for trial.\r\n\r\n"This is really too terrible," Nekhludoff said. "Can it be true?"\r\n\r\n"What are you surprised at?"\r\n\r\n"Why, everything. I can understand the police-officer, who simply obeys\r\norders, but the prosecutor drawing up an act of that kind. An educated\r\nman . . ."\r\n\r\n"That is where the mistake lies, that we are in the habit of considering\r\nthat the prosecutors and the judges in general are some kind of liberal\r\npersons. There was a time when they were such, but now it is quite\r\ndifferent. They are just officials, only troubled about pay-day.\r\nThey receive their salaries and want them increased, and there their\r\nprinciples end. They will accuse, judge, and sentence any one you like."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but do laws really exist that can condemn a man to Siberia for\r\nreading the Bible with his friends?"\r\n\r\n"Not only to be exiled to the less remote parts of Siberia, but even to\r\nthe mines, if you can only prove that reading the Bible they took the\r\nliberty of explaining it to others not according to orders, and in this\r\nway condemned the explanations given by the Church. Blaming the Greek\r\northodox religion in the presence of the common people means, according\r\nto Statute . . . the mines."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"I assure you it is so. I always tell these gentlemen, the judges,"\r\nthe advocate continued, "that I cannot look at them without gratitude,\r\nbecause if I am not in prison, and you, and all of us, it is only owing\r\nto their kindness. To deprive us of our privileges, and send us all to\r\nthe less remote parts of Siberia, would be an easy thing for them."\r\n\r\n"Well, if it is so, and if everything depends on the Procureur and\r\nothers who can, at will, either enforce the laws or not, what are the\r\ntrials for?"\r\n\r\nThe advocate burst into a merry laugh. "You do put strange questions.\r\nMy dear sir, that is philosophy. Well, we might have a talk about that,\r\ntoo. Could you come on Saturday? You will meet men of science, literary\r\nmen, and artists at my house, and then we might discuss these general\r\nquestions," said the advocate, pronouncing the words "general questions"\r\nwith ironical pathos. "You have met my wife? Do come."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I will try to," said Nekhludoff, and felt that he was saying\r\nan untruth, and knew that if he tried to do anything it would be to keep\r\naway froth the advocate\'s literary evening, and the circle of the men of\r\nscience, art, and literature.\r\n\r\nThe laugh with which the advocate met Nekhludoff\'s remark that trials\r\ncould have no meaning if the judges might enforce the laws or not,\r\naccording to their notion, and the tone with which he pronounced the\r\nwords "philosophy" and "general questions" proved to Nekhludoff how very\r\ndifferently he and the advocate and, probably, the advocate\'s friends,\r\nlooked at things; and he felt that in spite of the distance that now\r\nexisted between himself and his former companions, Schonbock, etc.,\r\nthe difference between himself and the circle of the advocate and his\r\nfriends was still greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWHY THE PEASANTS FLOCK TO TOWN.\r\n\r\nThe prison was a long way off and it was getting late, so Nekhludoff\r\ntook an isvostchik. The isvostchik, a middle-aged man with an\r\nintelligent and kind face, turned round towards Nekhludoff as they were\r\ndriving along one of the streets and pointed to a huge house that was\r\nbeing built there.\r\n\r\n"Just see what a tremendous house they have begun to build," he said, as\r\nif he was partly responsible for the building of the house and proud of\r\nit. The house was really immense and was being built in a very original\r\nstyle. The strong pine beams of the scaffolding were firmly fixed\r\ntogether with iron bands and a plank wall separated the building from\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\nOn the boards of the scaffolding workmen, all bespattered with plaster,\r\nmoved hither and thither like ants. Some were laying bricks, some hewing\r\nstones, some carrying up the heavy hods and pails and bringing them down\r\nempty. A fat and finely-dressed gentleman--probably the architect--stood\r\nby the scaffolding, pointing upward and explaining something to a\r\ncontractor, a peasant from the Vladimir Government, who was respectfully\r\nlistening to him. Empty carts were coming out of the gate by which the\r\narchitect and the contractor were standing, and loaded ones were going\r\nin. "And how sure they all are--those that do the work as well as those\r\nthat make them do it--that it ought to be; that while their wives at\r\nhome, who are with child, are labouring beyond their strength, and their\r\nchildren with the patchwork caps, doomed soon to the cold grave, smile\r\nwith suffering and contort their little legs, they must be building this\r\nstupid and useless palace for some stupid and useless person--one of\r\nthose who spoil and rob them," Nekhludoff thought, while looking at the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a stupid house," he said, uttering his thought out aloud.\r\n\r\n"Why stupid?" replied the isvostchik, in an offended tone. "Thanks to\r\nit, the people get work; it\'s not stupid."\r\n\r\n"But the work is useless."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be useless, or why should it be done?" said the isvostchik.\r\n"The people get bread by it."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was silent, and it would have been difficult to talk because\r\nof the clatter the wheels made.\r\n\r\nWhen they came nearer the prison, and the isvostchik turned off the\r\npaved on to the macadamised road, it became easier to talk, and he again\r\nturned to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"And what a lot of these people are flocking to the town nowadays; it\'s\r\nawful," he said, turning round on the box and pointing to a party of\r\npeasant workmen who were coming towards them, carrying saws, axes,\r\nsheepskins, coats, and bags strapped to their shoulders.\r\n\r\n"More than in other years?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"By far. This year every place is crowded, so that it\'s just terrible.\r\nThe employers just fling the workmen about like chaff. Not a job to be\r\ngot."\r\n\r\n"Why is that?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve increased. There\'s no room for them."\r\n\r\n"Well, what if they have increased? Why do not they stay in the\r\nvillage?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing for them to do in the village--no land to be had."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt as one does when touching a sore place. It feels as if\r\nthe bruised part was always being hit; yet it is only because the place\r\nis sore that the touch is felt.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that the same thing is happening everywhere?" he\r\nthought, and began questioning the isvostchik about the quantity of land\r\nin his village, how much land the man himself had, and why he had left\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n"We have a desiatin per man, sir," he said. "Our family have three men\'s\r\nshares of the land. My father and a brother are at home, and manage the\r\nland, and another brother is serving in the army. But there\'s nothing to\r\nmanage. My brother has had thoughts of coming to Moscow, too."\r\n\r\n"And cannot land be rented?"\r\n\r\n"How\'s one to rent it nowadays? The gentry, such as they were, have\r\nsquandered all theirs. Men of business have got it all into their own\r\nhands. One can\'t rent it from them. They farm it themselves. We have\r\na Frenchman ruling in our place; he bought the estate from our former\r\nlandlord, and won\'t let it--and there\'s an end of it."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that Frenchman?"\r\n\r\n"Dufour is the Frenchman\'s name. Perhaps you\'ve heard of him. He makes\r\nwigs for the actors in the big theatre; it is a good business, so he\'s\r\nprospering. He bought it from our lady, the whole of the estate, and now\r\nhe has us in his power; he just rides on us as he pleases. The Lord be\r\nthanked, he is a good man himself; only his wife, a Russian, is such a\r\nbrute that--God have mercy on us. She robs the people. It\'s awful. Well,\r\nhere\'s the prison. Am I to drive you to the entrance? I\'m afraid they\'ll\r\nnot let us do it, though."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nNURSE MASLOVA.\r\n\r\nWhen he rang the bell at the front entrance Nekhludoff\'s heart stood\r\nstill with horror as he thought of the state he might find Maslova in\r\nto-day, and at the mystery that he felt to be in her and in the people\r\nthat were collected in the prison. He asked the jailer who opened the\r\ndoor for Maslova. After making the necessary inquiry the jailer informed\r\nhim that she was in the hospital. Nekhludoff went there. A kindly old\r\nman, the hospital doorkeeper, let him in at once and, after asking\r\nNekhludoff whom he wanted, directed him to the children\'s ward. A young\r\ndoctor saturated with carbolic acid met Nekhludoff in the passage and\r\nasked him severely what he wanted. This doctor was always making all\r\nsorts of concessions to the prisoners, and was therefore continually\r\ncoming into conflict with the prison authorities and even with the head\r\ndoctor. Fearing lest Nekhludoff should demand something unlawful, and\r\nwishing to show that he made no exceptions for any one, he pretended to\r\nbe cross. "There are no women here; it is the children\'s ward," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know; but a prisoner has been removed here to be an assistant\r\nnurse."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there are two such here. Then whom do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I am closely connected with one of them, named Maslova," Nekhludoff\r\nanswered, "and should like to speak to her. I am going to Petersburg to\r\nhand in an appeal to the Senate about her case and should like to give\r\nher this. It is only a photo," Nekhludoff said, taking an envelope out\r\nof his pocket.\r\n\r\n"All right, you may do that," said the doctor, relenting, and turning to\r\nan old woman with a white apron, he told her to call the prisoner--Nurse\r\nMaslova.\r\n\r\n"Will you take a seat, or go into the waiting-room?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Nekhludoff, and profiting by the favourable change in\r\nthe manner of the doctor towards him asked how they were satisfied with\r\nMaslova in the hospital.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she is all right. She works fairly well, if you the conditions of\r\nher former life into account. But here she is."\r\n\r\nThe old nurse came in at one of the doors, followed by Maslova, who wore\r\na blue striped dress, a white apron, a kerchief that quite covered her\r\nhair. When she saw Nekhludoff her face flushed, and she stopped as if\r\nhesitating, then frowned, and with downcast eyes went quickly towards\r\nhim along the strip of carpet in the middle of the passage. When she\r\ncame up to Nekhludoff she did not wish to give him her hand, and then\r\ngave it, growing redder still. Nekhludoff had not seen her since the\r\nday when she begged forgiveness for having been in a passion, and he\r\nexpected to find her the same as she was then. But to-day she was\r\nquite different. There was something new in the expression of her face,\r\nreserve and shyness, and, as it seemed to him, animosity towards him. He\r\ntold her what he had already said to the doctor, i.e., that he was going\r\nto Petersburg, and he handed her the envelope with the photograph which\r\nhe had brought from Panovo.\r\n\r\n"I found this in Panovo--it\'s an old photo; perhaps you would like it.\r\nTake it."\r\n\r\nLifting her dark eyebrows, she looked at him with surprise in her\r\nsquinting eyes, as if asking, "What is this for?" took the photo\r\nsilently and put it in the bib of her apron.\r\n\r\n"I saw your aunt there," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Did you?" she said, indifferently.\r\n\r\n"Are you all right here?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, it\'s all right," she said.\r\n\r\n"Not too difficult?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. But I am not used to it yet."\r\n\r\n"I am glad, for your sake. Anyhow, it is better than there."\r\n\r\n"Than where--there?" she asked, her face flushing again.\r\n\r\n"There--in the prison," Nekhludoff hurriedly answered.\r\n\r\n"Why better?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I think the people are better. Here are none such as there must be\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"There are many good ones there," she said.\r\n\r\n"I have been seeing about the Menshoffs, and hope they will be\r\nliberated," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"God grant they may. Such a splendid old woman," she said, again\r\nrepeating her opinion of the old woman, and slightly smiling.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Petersburg to-day. Your case will come on soon, and I\r\nhope the sentence will be repealed."\r\n\r\n"Whether it is repealed or not won\'t matter now," she said.\r\n\r\n"Why not now?"\r\n\r\n"So," she said, looking with a quick, questioning glance into his eyes.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff understood the word and the look to mean that she wished\r\nto know whether he still kept firm to his decision or had accepted her\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\n"I do not know why it does not matter to you," he said. "It certainly\r\ndoes not matter as far as I am concerned whether you are acquitted or\r\nnot. I am ready to do what I told you in any case," he said decidedly.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head and her black squinting eyes remained fixed on him\r\nand beyond him, and her face beamed with joy. But the words she spoke\r\nwere very different from what her eyes said.\r\n\r\n"You should not speak like that," she said.\r\n\r\n"I am saying it so that you should know."\r\n\r\n"Everything has been said about that, and there is no use speaking," she\r\nsaid, with difficulty repressing a smile.\r\n\r\nA sudden noise came from the hospital ward, and the sound of a child\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n"I think they are calling me," she said, and looked round uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye, then," he said. She pretended not to see his extended\r\nhand, and, without taking it, turned away and hastily walked along the\r\nstrip of carpet, trying to hide the triumph she felt.\r\n\r\n"What is going on in her? What is she thinking? What does she feel? Does\r\nshe mean to prove me, or can she really not forgive me? Is it that she\r\ncannot or that she will not express what she feels and thinks? Has she\r\nsoftened or hardened?" he asked himself, and could find no answer. He\r\nonly knew that she had altered and that an important change was going on\r\nin her soul, and this change united him not only to her but also to Him\r\nfor whose sake that change was being wrought. And this union brought on\r\na state of joyful animation and tenderness.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to the ward, in which there stood eight small beds,\r\nMaslova began, in obedience to the nurse\'s order, to arrange one of the\r\nbeds; and, bending over too far with the sheet, she slipped and nearly\r\nfell down.\r\n\r\nA little convalescent boy with a bandaged neck, who was looking at her,\r\nlaughed. Maslova could no longer contain herself and burst into loud\r\nlaughter, and such contagious laughter that several of the children also\r\nburst out laughing, and one of the sisters rebuked her angrily.\r\n\r\n"What are you giggling at? Do you think you are where you used to be?\r\nGo and fetch the food." Maslova obeyed and went where she was sent; but,\r\ncatching the eye of the bandaged boy who was not allowed to laugh, she\r\nagain burst out laughing.\r\n\r\nWhenever she was alone Maslova again and again pulled the photograph\r\npartly out of the envelope and looked at it admiringly; but only in the\r\nevening when she was off duty and alone in the bedroom which she shared\r\nwith a nurse, did she take it quite out of the envelope and gaze long\r\nat the faded yellow photograph, caressing with, her eyes every detail\r\nof faces and clothing, the steps of the veranda, and the bushes which\r\nserved as a background to his and hers and his aunts\' faces, and could\r\nnot cease from admiring especially herself--her pretty young face with\r\nthe curly hair round the forehead. She was so absorbed that she did not\r\nhear her fellow-nurse come into the room.\r\n\r\n"What is it that he\'s given you?" said the good-natured, fat nurse,\r\nstooping over the photograph.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this? You?"\r\n\r\n"Who else?" said Maslova, looking into her companion\'s face with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"And who\'s this?"\r\n\r\n"Himself."\r\n\r\n"And is this his mother?"\r\n\r\n"No, his aunt. Would you not have known me?"\r\n\r\n"Never. The whole face is altered. Why, it must be 10 years since then."\r\n\r\n"Not years, but a lifetime," said Maslova. And suddenly her animation\r\nwent, her face grew gloomy, and a deep line appeared between her brows.\r\n\r\n"Why so? Your way of life must have been an easy one."\r\n\r\n"Easy, indeed," Maslova reiterated, closing her eyes and shaking her\r\nhead. "It is hell."\r\n\r\n"Why, what makes it so?"\r\n\r\n"What makes it so! From eight till four in the morning, and every night\r\nthe same!"\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t they give it up?"\r\n\r\n"They can\'t give it up if they want to. But what\'s the use of talking?"\r\nMaslova said, jumping up and throwing the photograph into the drawer of\r\nthe table. And with difficulty repressing angry tears, she ran out into\r\nthe passage and slammed the door.\r\n\r\nWhile looking at the group she imagined herself such as she was there\r\nand dreamt of her happiness then and of the possibility of happiness\r\nwith him now. But her companion\'s words reminded her of what she was now\r\nand what she had been, and brought back all the horrors of that life,\r\nwhich she had felt but dimly, and not allowed herself to realise.\r\n\r\nIt was only now that the memory of all those terrible nights came\r\nvividly back to her, especially one during the carnival when she was\r\nexpecting a student who had promised to buy her out. She remembered how\r\nshe--wearing her low necked silk dress stained with wine, a red bow in\r\nher untidy hair, wearied, weak, half tipsy, having seen her visitors\r\noff, sat down during an interval in the dancing by the piano beside the\r\nbony pianiste with the blotchy face, who played the accompaniments\r\nto the violin, and began complaining of her hard fate; and how this\r\npianiste said that she, too, was feeling how heavy her position was and\r\nwould like to change it; and how Clara suddenly came up to them; and how\r\nthey all three decided to change their life. They thought that the night\r\nwas over, and were about to go away, when suddenly the noise of tipsy\r\nvoices was heard in the ante-room. The violinist played a tune and the\r\npianiste began hammering the first figure of a quadrille on the piano,\r\nto the tune of a most merry Russian song. A small, perspiring man,\r\nsmelling of spirits, with a white tie and swallow-tail coat, which he\r\ntook off after the first figure, came up to her, hiccoughing, and\r\ncaught her up, while another fat man, with a beard, and also wearing a\r\ndress-coat (they had come straight from a ball) caught Clara up, and for\r\na long time they turned, danced, screamed, drank. . . . And so it\r\nwent on for another year, and another, and a third. How could she help\r\nchanging? And he was the cause of it all. And, suddenly, all her former\r\nbitterness against him reawoke; she wished to scold, to reproach him.\r\nShe regretted having neglected the opportunity of repeating to him once\r\nmore that she knew him, and would not give in to him--would not let him\r\nmake use of her spiritually as he had done physically.\r\n\r\nAnd she longed for drink in order to stifle the feeling of pity to\r\nherself and the useless feeling of reproach to him. And she would have\r\nbroken her word if she had been inside the prison. Here she could not\r\nget any spirits except by applying to the medical assistant, and she was\r\nafraid of him because he made up to her, and intimate relations with\r\nmen were disgusting to her now. After sitting a while on a form in the\r\npassage she returned to her little room, and without paying any heed to\r\nher companion\'s words, she wept for a long time over her wrecked life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAN ARISTOCRATIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had four matters to attend to in Petersburg. The first was\r\nthe appeal to the Senate in Maslova\'s case; the second, to hand in\r\nTheodosia Birukoff\'s petition to the committee; the third, to comply\r\nwith Vera Doukhova\'s requests--i.e., try to get her friend Shoustova\r\nreleased from prison, and get permission for a mother to visit her son\r\nin prison. Vera Doukhova had written to him about this, and he was\r\ngoing to the Gendarmerie Office to attend to these two matters, which he\r\ncounted as one.\r\n\r\nThe fourth matter he meant to attend to was the case of some sectarians\r\nwho had been separated from their families and exiled to the Caucasus\r\nbecause they read and discussed the Gospels. It was not so much to\r\nthem as to himself he had promised to do all he could to clear up this\r\naffair.\r\n\r\nSince his last visit to Maslennikoff, and especially since he had been\r\nin the country, Nekhludoff had not exactly formed a resolution but felt\r\nwith his whole nature a loathing for that society in which he had lived\r\ntill then, that society which so carefully hides the sufferings of\r\nmillions in order to assure ease and pleasure to a small number of\r\npeople, that the people belonging to this society do not and cannot\r\nsee these sufferings, nor the cruelty and wickedness of their life.\r\nNekhludoff could no longer move in this society without feeling ill at\r\nease and reproaching himself. And yet all the ties of relationship and\r\nfriendship, and his own habits, were drawing him back into this society.\r\nBesides, that which alone interested him now, his desire to help Maslova\r\nand the other sufferers, made it necessary to ask for help and service\r\nfrom persons belonging to that society, persons whom he not only could\r\nnot respect, but who often aroused in him indignation and a feeling of\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to Petersburg and stopped at his aunt\'s--his mother\'s\r\nsister, the Countess Tcharsky, wife of a former minister--Nekhludoff at\r\nonce found himself in the very midst of that aristocratic circle which\r\nhad grown so foreign to him. This was very unpleasant, but there was no\r\npossibility of getting out of it. To put up at an hotel instead of at\r\nhis aunt\'s house would have been to offend his aunt, and, besides, his\r\naunt had important connections and might be extremely useful in all\r\nthese matters he meant to attend to.\r\n\r\n"What is this I hear about you? All sorts of marvels," said the Countess\r\nKaterina Ivanovna Tcharsky, as she gave him his coffee immediately after\r\nhis arrival. "_Vous posez pour un Howard_. Helping criminals, going the\r\nround of prisons, setting things right."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. I never thought of it."\r\n\r\n"Why not? It is a good thing, only there seems to be some romantic story\r\nconnected with it. Let us hear all about it."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff told her the whole truth about his relations to Maslova.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I remember your poor mother telling me about it. That was\r\nwhen you were staying with those old women. I believe they wished to\r\nmarry you to their ward (the Countess Katerina Ivanovna had always\r\ndespised Nekhludoff\'s aunts on his father\'s side). So it\'s she. _Elle\r\nest encore jolie?_"\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna was a strong, bright, energetic, talkative woman of\r\n60. She was tall and very stout, and had a decided black moustache\r\non her lip. Nekhludoff was fond of her and had even as a child been\r\ninfected by her energy and mirth.\r\n\r\n"No, ma tante, that\'s at an end. I only wish to help her, because she is\r\ninnocently accused. I am the cause of it and the cause of her fate being\r\nwhat it is. I feel it my duty to do all I can for her."\r\n\r\n"But what is this I have heard about your intention of marrying her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was my intention, but she does not wish it."\r\n\r\nKaterina Ivanovna looked at her nephew with raised brows and drooping\r\neyeballs, in silent amazement. Suddenly her face changed, and with a\r\nlook of pleasure she said: "Well, she is wiser than you. Dear me, you\r\nare a fool. And you would have married her?"\r\n\r\n"Most certainly."\r\n\r\n"After her having been what she was?"\r\n\r\n"All the more, since I was the cause of it."\r\n\r\n"Well, you are a simpleton," said his aunt, repressing a smile, "a\r\nterrible simpleton; but it is just because you are such a terrible\r\nsimpleton that I love you." She repeated the word, evidently liking it,\r\nas it seemed to correctly convey to her mind the idea of her nephew\'s\r\nmoral state. "Do you know--What a lucky chance. Aline has a wonderful\r\nhome--the Magdalene Home. I went there once. They are terribly\r\ndisgusting. After that I had to pray continually. But Aline is devoted\r\nto it, body and soul, so we shall place her there--yours, I mean."\r\n\r\n"But she is condemned to Siberia. I have come on purpose to appeal about\r\nit. This is one of my requests to you."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, and where do you appeal to in this case?"\r\n\r\n"To the Senate."\r\n\r\n"Ah, the Senate! Yes, my dear Cousin Leo is in the Senate, but he is in\r\nthe heraldry department, and I don\'t know any of the real ones. They are\r\nall some kind of Germans--Gay, Fay, Day--tout l\'alphabet, or else all\r\nsorts of Ivanoffs, Simenoffs, Nikitines, or else Ivanenkos, Simonenkos,\r\nNikitenkos, pour varier. Des gens de l\'autre monde. Well, it is all the\r\nsame. I\'ll tell my husband, he knows them. He knows all sorts of people.\r\nI\'ll tell him, but you will have to explain, he never understands me.\r\nWhatever I may say, he always maintains he does not understand it. C\'est\r\nun parti pris, every one understands but only not he."\r\n\r\nAt this moment a footman with stockinged legs came in with a note on a\r\nsilver platter.\r\n\r\n"There now, from Aline herself. You\'ll have a chance of hearing\r\nKiesewetter."\r\n\r\n"Who is Kiesewetter?"\r\n\r\n"Kiesewetter? Come this evening, and you will find out who he is. He\r\nspeaks in such a way that the most hardened criminals sink on their\r\nknees and weep and repent."\r\n\r\nThe Countess Katerina Ivanovna, however strange it may seem, and however\r\nlittle it seemed in keeping with the rest of her character, was a\r\nstaunch adherent to that teaching which holds that the essence of\r\nChristianity lies in the belief in redemption. She went to meetings\r\nwhere this teaching, then in fashion, was being preached, and assembled\r\nthe "faithful" in her own house. Though this teaching repudiated all\r\nceremonies, icons, and sacraments, Katerina Ivanovna had icons in every\r\nroom, and one on the wall above her bed, and she kept all that the\r\nChurch prescribed without noticing any contradiction in that.\r\n\r\n"There now; if your Magdalene could hear him she would be converted,"\r\nsaid the Countess. "Do stay at home to-night; you will hear him. He is a\r\nwonderful man."\r\n\r\n"It does not interest me, ma tante."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you that it is interesting, and you must come home. Now you\r\nmay go. What else do you want of me? _Videz votre sac_."\r\n\r\n"The next is in the fortress."\r\n\r\n"In the fortress? I can give you a note for that to the Baron\r\nKriegsmuth. _Cest un tres brave homme_. Oh, but you know him; he was a\r\ncomrade of your father\'s. _Il donne dans le spiritisme_. But that does\r\nnot matter, he is a good fellow. What do you want there?"\r\n\r\n"I want to get leave for a mother to visit her son who is imprisoned\r\nthere. But I was told that this did not depend on Kriegsmuth but on\r\nTcherviansky."\r\n\r\n"I do not like Tcherviansky, but he is Mariette\'s husband; we might ask\r\nher. She will do it for me. _Elle est tres gentille_."\r\n\r\n"I have also to petition for a woman who is imprisoned there without\r\nknowing what for."\r\n\r\n"No fear; she knows well enough. They all know it very well, and it\r\nserves them right, those short-haired [many advanced women wear their\r\nhair short, like men] ones."\r\n\r\n"We do not know whether it serves them right or not. But they suffer.\r\nYou are a Christian and believe in the Gospel teaching and yet you are\r\nso pitiless."\r\n\r\n"That has nothing to do with it. The Gospels are the Gospels, but what\r\nis disgusting remains disgusting. It would be worse if I pretended to\r\nlove Nihilists, especially short-haired women Nihilists, when I cannot\r\nbear them."\r\n\r\n"Why can you not bear them?"\r\n\r\n"You ask why, after the 1st of March?" [The Emperor Alexander II was\r\nkilled on the first of March, old style.]\r\n\r\n"They did not all take part in it on the 1st of March."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; they should not meddle with what is no business of theirs.\r\nIt\'s not women\'s business."\r\n\r\n"Yet you consider that Mariette may take part in business."\r\n\r\n"Mariette? Mariette is Mariette, and these are goodness knows what. Want\r\nto teach everybody."\r\n\r\n"Not to teach but simply to help the people."\r\n\r\n"One knows whom to help and whom not to help without them."\r\n\r\n"But the peasants are in great need. I have just returned from the\r\ncountry. Is it necessary, that the peasants should work to the very\r\nlimits of their strength and never have sufficient to eat while we are\r\nliving in the greatest luxury?" said Nekhludoff, involuntarily led on by\r\nhis aunt\'s good nature into telling her what he was in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n"What do you want, then? That I should work and not eat anything?"\r\n\r\n"No, I do not wish you not to eat. I only wish that we should all work\r\nand all eat." He could not help smiling as he said it.\r\n\r\nAgain raising her brow and drooping her eyeballs his aunt looked at him\r\ncuriously. "_Mon cher vous finirez mal_," she said.\r\n\r\nJust then the general, and former minister, Countess Tcharsky\'s husband,\r\na tall, broad-shouldered man, came into the room.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Dmitri, how d\'you do?" he said, turning his freshly-shaved cheek to\r\nNekhludoff to be kissed. "When did you get here?" And he silently kissed\r\nhis wife on the forehead.\r\n\r\n"_Non il est impayable_," the Countess said, turning to her husband.\r\n"He wants me to go and wash clothes and live on potatoes. He is an awful\r\nfool, but all the same do what he is going to ask of you. A terrible\r\nsimpleton," she added. "Have you heard? Kamenskaya is in such despair\r\nthat they fear for her life," she said to her husband. "You should go\r\nand call there."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is dreadful," said her husband.\r\n\r\n"Go along, then, and talk to him. I must write some letters."\r\n\r\nHardly had Nekhludoff stepped into the room next the drawing-room than\r\nshe called him back.\r\n\r\n"Shall I write to Mariette, then?"\r\n\r\n"Please, ma tante."\r\n\r\n"I shall leave a blank for what you want to say about the short-haired\r\none, and she will give her husband his orders, and he\'ll do it. Do not\r\nthink me wicked; they are all so disgusting, your prologues, but _je\r\nne leur veux pas de mal_, bother them. Well, go, but be sure to stay at\r\nhome this evening to hear Kiesewetter, and we shall have some prayers.\r\nAnd if only you do not resist _cela vous fera beaucoup de bien_. I\r\nknow your poor mother and all of you were always very backward in these\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nAN AVERAGE STATESMAN.\r\n\r\nCount Ivan Michaelovitch had been a minister, and was a man of strong\r\nconvictions. The convictions of Count Ivan Michaelovitch consisted in\r\nthe belief that, just as it was natural for a bird to feed on worms,\r\nto be clothed in feathers and down, and to fly in the air, so it\r\nwas natural for him to feed on the choicest and most expensive food,\r\nprepared by highly-paid cooks, to wear the most comfortable and most\r\nexpensive clothing, to drive with the best and fastest horses, and that,\r\ntherefore, all these things should be ready found for him. Besides this,\r\nCount Ivan Michaelovitch considered that the more money he could get out\r\nof the treasury by all sorts of means, the more orders he had, including\r\ndifferent diamond insignia of something or other, and the oftener he\r\nspoke to highly-placed individuals of both sexes, so much the better it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nAll the rest Count Ivan Michaelovitch considered insignificant and\r\nuninteresting beside these dogmas. All the rest might be as it was, or\r\njust the reverse. Count Ivan Michaelovitch lived and acted according\r\nto these lights for 40 years, and at the end of 40 years reached the\r\nposition of a Minister of State. The chief qualities that enabled\r\nCount Ivan Michaelovitch to reach this position were his capacity of\r\nunderstanding the meaning of documents and laws and of drawing up,\r\nthough clumsily, intelligible State papers, and of spelling them\r\ncorrectly; secondly, his very stately appearance, which enabled him,\r\nwhen necessary, to seem not only extremely proud, but unapproachable\r\nand majestic, while at other times he could be abjectly and almost\r\npassionately servile; thirdly, the absence of any general principles\r\nor rules, either of personal or administrative morality, which made it\r\npossible for him either to agree or disagree with anybody according to\r\nwhat was wanted at the time. When acting thus his only endeavour was\r\nto sustain the appearance of good breeding and not to seem too plainly\r\ninconsistent. As for his actions being moral or not, in themselves, or\r\nwhether they were going to result in the highest welfare or greatest\r\nevil for the whole of the Russian Empire, or even the entire world, that\r\nwas quite indifferent to him. When he became minister, not only\r\nthose dependent on him (and there were great many of them) and people\r\nconnected with him, but many strangers and even he himself were\r\nconvinced that he was a very clever statesman. But after some time had\r\nelapsed and he had done nothing and had nothing to show, and when in\r\naccordance with the law of the struggle for existence others, like\r\nhimself, who had learnt to write and understand documents, stately and\r\nunprincipled officials, had displaced him, he turned out to be not\r\nonly far from clever but very limited and badly educated. Though\r\nself-assured, his views hardly reaching the level of those in the\r\nleading articles of the Conservative papers, it became apparent\r\nthat there was nothing in him to distinguish him from those other\r\nbadly-educated and self-assured officials who had pushed him out, and\r\nhe himself saw it. But this did not shake his conviction that he had to\r\nreceive a great deal of money out of the Treasury every year, and new\r\ndecorations for his dress clothes. This conviction was so firm that no\r\none had the pluck to refuse these things to him, and he received yearly,\r\npartly in form of a pension, partly as a salary for being a member in\r\na Government institution and chairman of all sorts of committees\r\nand councils, several tens of thousands of roubles, besides the\r\nright--highly prized by him--of sewing all sorts of new cords to his\r\nshoulders and trousers, and ribbons to wear under and enamel stars\r\nto fix on to his dress coat. In consequence of this Count Ivan\r\nMichaelovitch had very high connections.\r\n\r\nCount Ivan Michaelovitch listened to Nekhludoff as he was wont to listen\r\nto the reports of the permanent secretary of his department, and, having\r\nheard him, said he would give him two notes, one to the Senator Wolff,\r\nof the Appeal Department. "All sorts of things are reported of him, but\r\ndans tous les cas c\'est un homme tres comme ii faut," he said. "He is\r\nindebted to me, and will do all that is possible." The other note Count\r\nIvan Michaelovitch gave Nekhludoff was to an influential member of\r\nthe Petition Committee. The story of Theodosia Birukoff as told by\r\nNekhludoff interested him very much. When Nekhludoff said that he\r\nthought of writing to the Empress, the Count replied that it certainly\r\nwas a very touching story, and might, if occasion presented itself, he\r\ntold her, but he could not promise. Let the petition be handed in in due\r\nform.\r\n\r\nShould there be an opportunity, and if a petit comite were called on\r\nThursday, he thought he would tell her the story. As soon as Nekhludoff\r\nhad received these two notes, and a note to Mariette from his aunt, he\r\nat once set off to these different places.\r\n\r\nFirst he went to Mariette\'s. He had known her as a half-grown girl, the\r\ndaughter of an aristocratic but not wealthy family, and had heard how\r\nshe had married a man who was making a career, whom Nekhludoff had heard\r\nbadly spoken of; and, as usual, he felt it hard to ask a favour of a man\r\nhe did not esteem. In these cases he always felt an inner dissension\r\nand dissatisfaction, and wavered whether to ask the favour or not, and\r\nalways resolved to ask. Besides feeling himself in a false position\r\namong those to whose set he no longer regarded himself as belonging, who\r\nyet regarded him as belonging to them, he felt himself getting into the\r\nold accustomed rut, and in spite of himself fell into the thoughtless\r\nand immoral tone that reigned in that circle. He felt that from the\r\nfirst, with his aunt, he involuntarily fell into a bantering tone while\r\ntalking about serious matters.\r\n\r\nPetersburg in general affected him with its usual physically\r\ninvigorating and mentally dulling effect.\r\n\r\nEverything so clean, so comfortably well-arranged and the people so\r\nlenient in moral matters, that life seemed very easy.\r\n\r\nA fine, clean, and polite isvostchik drove him past fine, clean, polite\r\npolicemen, along the fine, clean, watered streets, past fine, clean\r\nhouses to the house in which Mariette lived. At the front door stood\r\na pair of English horses, with English harness, and an English-looking\r\ncoachman on the box, with the lower part of his face shaved, proudly\r\nholding a whip. The doorkeeper, dressed in a wonderfully clean livery,\r\nopened the door into the hall, where in still cleaner livery with gold\r\ncords stood the footman with his splendid whiskers well combed out,\r\nand the orderly on duty in a brand-new uniform. "The general does not\r\nreceive, and the generaless does not receive either. She is just going\r\nto drive out."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff took out Katerina Ivanovna\'s letter, and going up to a table\r\non which lay a visitors\' book, began to write that he was sorry not to\r\nhave been able to see any one; when the footman went up the staircase\r\nthe doorkeeper went out and shouted to the coachman, and the orderly\r\nstood up rigid with his arms at his sides following with his eyes a\r\nlittle, slight lady, who was coming down the stairs with rapid steps not\r\nin keeping with all the grandeur.\r\n\r\nMariette had a large hat on, with feathers, a black dress and cape, and\r\nnew black gloves. Her face was covered by a veil.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw Nekhludoff she lifted the veil off a very pretty face with\r\nbright eyes that looked inquiringly at him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Prince Dmitri Ivanovitch Nekhludoff," she said, with a soft,\r\npleasant voice. "I should have known--"\r\n\r\n"What! you even remember my name?"\r\n\r\n"I should think so. Why, I and my sisters have even been in love with\r\nyou," she said, in French. "But, dear me, how you have altered. Oh, what\r\na pity I have to go out. But let us go up again," she said and stopped\r\nhesitatingly. Then she looked at the clock. "No, I can\'t. I am going to\r\nKamenskaya\'s to attend a mass for the dead. She is terribly afflicted."\r\n\r\n"Who is this Kamenskaya?"\r\n\r\n"Have you not heard? Her son was killed in a duel. He fought Posen. He\r\nwas the only son. Terrible I The mother is very much afflicted."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I have heard of it."\r\n\r\n"No, I had better go, and you must come again, to-night or to-morrow,"\r\nshe said, and went to the door with quick, light steps.\r\n\r\n"I cannot come to-night," he said, going out after her; "but I have\r\na request to make you," and he looked at the pair of bays that were\r\ndrawing up to the front door.\r\n\r\n"What is this?"\r\n\r\n"This is a letter from aunt to you," said Nekhludoff, handing her\r\na narrow envelope, with a large crest. "You\'ll find all about it in\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"I know Countess Katerina Ivanovna thinks I have some influence with my\r\nhusband in business matters. She is mistaken. I can do nothing and do\r\nnot like to interfere. But, of course, for you I am willing to be false\r\nto my principle. What is this business about?" she said, searching in\r\nvain for her pocket with her little black gloved hand.\r\n\r\n"There is a girl imprisoned in the fortress, and she is ill and\r\ninnocent."\r\n\r\n"What is her name?"\r\n\r\n"Lydia Shoustova. It\'s in the note."\r\n\r\n"All right; I\'ll see what I can do," she said, and lightly jumped into\r\nher little, softly upholstered, open carriage, its brightly-varnished\r\nsplash-guards glistening in the sunshine, and opened her parasol. The\r\nfootman got on the box and gave the coachman a sign. The carriage moved,\r\nbut at that moment she touched the coachman with her parasol and the\r\nslim-legged beauties, the bay mares, stopped, bending their beautiful\r\nnecks and stepping from foot to foot.\r\n\r\n"But you must come, only, please, without interested motives," and she\r\nlooked at him with a smile, the force of which she well knew, and, as if\r\nthe performance over and she were drawing the curtain, she dropped\r\nthe veil over her face again. "All right," and she again touched the\r\ncoachman.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff raised his hat, and the well-bred bays, slightly snorting,\r\nset off, their shoes clattering on the pavement, and the carriage rolled\r\nquickly and smoothly on its new rubber tyres, giving a jump only now and\r\nthen over some unevenness of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAN UP-TO-DATE SENATOR.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff remembered the smiles that had passed between him and\r\nMariette, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n"You have hardly time to turn round before you are again drawn into\r\nthis life," he thought, feeling that discord and those doubts which the\r\nnecessity to curry favour from people he did not esteem caused.\r\n\r\nAfter considering where to go first, so as not to have to retrace his\r\nsteps, Nekhludoff set off for the Senate. There he was shown into the\r\noffice where he found a great many very polite and very clean officials\r\nin the midst of a magnificent apartment. Maslova\'s petition was received\r\nand handed on to that Wolf, to whom Nekhludoff had a letter from his\r\nuncle, to be examined and reported on.\r\n\r\n"There will be a meeting of the Senate this week," the official said to\r\nNekhludoff, "but Maslova\'s case will hardly come before that meeting."\r\n\r\n"It might come before the meeting on Wednesday, by special request," one\r\nof the officials remarked.\r\n\r\nDuring the time Nekhludoff waited in the office, while some information\r\nwas being taken, he heard that the conversation in the Senate was all\r\nabout the duel, and he heard a detailed account of how a young man,\r\nKaminski, had been killed. It was here he first heard all the facts of\r\nthe case which was exciting the interest of all Petersburg. The story\r\nwas this: Some officers were eating oysters and, as usual, drinking very\r\nmuch, when one of them said something ill-natured about the regiment to\r\nwhich Kaminski belonged, and Kaminski called him a liar. The other hit\r\nKaminski. The next day they fought. Kaminski was wounded in the stomach\r\nand died two hours later. The murderer and the seconds were arrested,\r\nbut it was said that though they were arrested and in the guardhouse\r\nthey would be set free in a fortnight.\r\n\r\nFrom the Senate Nekhludoff drove to see an influential member of the\r\npetition Committee, Baron Vorobioff, who lived in a splendid house\r\nbelonging to the Crown. The doorkeeper told Nekhludoff in a severe tone\r\nthat the Baron could not be seen except on his reception days; that he\r\nwas with His Majesty the Emperor to-day, and the next day he would again\r\nhave to deliver a report. Nekhludoff left his uncle\'s letter with the\r\ndoorkeeper and went on to see the Senator Wolf. Wolf had just had his\r\nlunch, and was as usual helping digestion by smoking a cigar and pacing\r\nup and down the room, when Nekhludoff came in. Vladimir Vasilievitch\r\nWolf was certainly _un homme tres comme il faut_, and prized this\r\nquality very highly, and from that elevation he looked down at everybody\r\nelse. He could not but esteem this quality of his very highly, because\r\nit was thanks to it alone that he had made a brilliant career, the very\r\ncareer he desired, i.e., by marriage he obtained a fortune which brought\r\nhim in 18,000 roubles a year, and by his own exertions the post of a\r\nsenator. He considered himself not only _un homme tres comme il faut_,\r\nbut also a man of knightly honour. By honour he understood not accepting\r\nsecret bribes from private persons. But he did not consider it dishonest\r\nto beg money for payment of fares and all sorts of travelling expenses\r\nfrom the Crown, and to do anything the Government might require of him\r\nin return. To ruin hundreds of innocent people, to cause them to be\r\nimprisoned, to be exiled because of their love for their people and the\r\nreligion of their fathers, as he had done in one of the governments of\r\nPoland when he was governor there. He did not consider it dishonourable,\r\nbut even thought it a noble, manly and patriotic action. Nor did he\r\nconsider it dishonest to rob his wife and sister-in-law, as he had\r\ndone, but thought it a wise way of arranging his family life. His family\r\nconsisted of his commonplace wife, his sister-in-law, whose fortune\r\nhe had appropriated by selling her estate and putting the money to his\r\naccount, and his meek, frightened, plain daughter, who lived a lonely,\r\nweary life, from which she had lately begun to look for relaxation in\r\nevangelicism, attending meetings at Aline\'s, and the Countess Katerina\r\nIvanovna. Wolf\'s son, who had grown a beard at the age of 15, and had at\r\nthat age begun to drink and lead a depraved life, which he continued to\r\ndo till the age of 20, when he was turned out by his father because\r\nhe never finished his studies, moved in a low set and made debts which\r\ncommitted the father. The father had once paid a debt of 250 roubles for\r\nhis son, then another of 600 roubles, but warned the son that he did it\r\nfor the last time, and that if the son did not reform he would be turned\r\nout of the house and all further intercourse between him and his family\r\nwould he put a stop to. The son did not reform, but made a debt of a\r\nthousand roubles, and took the liberty of telling his father that life\r\nat home was a torment anyhow. Then Wolf declared to his son that he\r\nmight go where he pleased--that he was no son of his any longer. Since\r\nthen Wolf pretended he had no son, and no one at home dared speak to him\r\nabout his son, and Vladimir Vasilievitch Wolf was firmly convinced that\r\nhe had arranged his family life in the best way. Wolf stopped pacing\r\nup and down his study, and greeted Nekhludoff with a friendly though\r\nslightly ironical smile. This was his way of showing how comme il faut\r\nhe was, and how superior to the majority of men. He read the note which\r\nNekhludoff handed to him.\r\n\r\n"Please take a seat, and excuse me if I continue to walk up and down,\r\nwith your permission," he said, putting his hands into his coat pockets,\r\nand began again to walk with light, soft steps across his large, quietly\r\nand stylishly furnished study. "Very pleased to make your acquaintance\r\nand of course very glad to do anything that Count Ivan Michaelovitch\r\nwishes," he said, blowing the fragrant blue smoke out of his mouth and\r\nremoving his cigar carefully so as not to drop the ash.\r\n\r\n"I should only like to ask that the case might come on soon, so that\r\nif the prisoner has to go to Siberia she might set off early," said\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, with one of the first steamers from Nijni. I know," said\r\nWolf, with his patronising smile, always knowing in advance whatever one\r\nwanted to tell him.\r\n\r\n"What is the prisoner\'s name?"\r\n\r\n"Maslova."\r\n\r\nWolf went up to the table and looked at a paper that lay on a piece of\r\ncardboard among other business papers.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Maslova. All right, I will ask the others. We shall hear the\r\ncase on Wednesday."\r\n\r\n"Then may I telegraph to the advocate?"\r\n\r\n"The advocate! What\'s that for? But if you like, why not?"\r\n\r\n"The causes for appeal may be insufficient," said Nekhludoff, "but\r\nI think the case will show that the sentence was passed owing to a\r\nmisunderstanding."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; it may be so, but the Senate cannot decide the case on its\r\nmerits," said Wolf, looking seriously at the ash of his cigar. "The\r\nSenate only considers the exactness of the application of the laws and\r\ntheir right interpretation."\r\n\r\n"But this seems to me to be an exceptional case."\r\n\r\n"I know, I know! All cases are exceptional. We shall do our duty. That\'s\r\nall." The ash was still holding on, but had began breaking, and was in\r\ndanger of falling.\r\n\r\n"Do you often come to Petersburg?" said Wolf, holding his cigar so that\r\nthe ash should not fall. But the ash began to shake, and Wolf carefully\r\ncarried it to the ashpan, into which it fell.\r\n\r\n"What a terrible thing this is with regard to Kaminski," he said. "A\r\nsplendid young man. The only son. Especially the mother\'s position," he\r\nwent on, repeating almost word for word what every one in Petersburg\r\nwas at that time saying about Kaminski. Wolf spoke a little about the\r\nCountess Katerina Ivanovna and her enthusiasm for the new religious\r\nteaching, which he neither approved nor disapproved of, but which was\r\nevidently needless to him who was so comme il faut, and then rang the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff bowed.\r\n\r\n"If it is convenient, come and dine on Wednesday, and I will give you a\r\ndecisive answer," said Wolf, extending his hand.\r\n\r\nIt was late, and Nekhludoff returned to his aunt\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOUNTESS KATERINA IVANOVNA\'S DINNER PARTY.\r\n\r\nCountess Katerina Ivanovna\'s dinner hour was half-past seven, and the\r\ndinner was served in a new manner that Nekhludoff had not yet seen\r\nanywhere. After they had placed the dishes on the table the waiters left\r\nthe room and the diners helped themselves. The men would not let the\r\nladies take the trouble of moving, and, as befitted the stronger sex,\r\nthey manfully took on themselves the burden of putting the food on\r\nthe ladies\' plates and of filling their glasses. When one course was\r\nfinished, the Countess pressed the button of an electric bell fitted\r\nto the table and the waiters stepped in noiselessly and quickly carried\r\naway the dishes, changed the plates, and brought in the next course.\r\nThe dinner was very refined, the wines very costly. A French chef was\r\nworking in the large, light kitchens, with two white-clad assistants.\r\nThere were six persons at dinner, the Count and Countess, their son\r\n(a surly officer in the Guards who sat with his elbows on the table),\r\nNekhludoff, a French lady reader, and the Count\'s chief steward, who\r\nhad come up from the country. Here, too, the conversation was about the\r\nduel, and opinions were given as to how the Emperor regarded the case.\r\nIt was known that the Emperor was very much grieved for the mother\'s\r\nsake, and all were grieved for her, and as it was also known that the\r\nEmperor did not mean to be very severe to the murderer, who defended\r\nthe honour of his uniform, all were also lenient to the officer who had\r\ndefended the honour of his uniform. Only the Countess Katerina Ivanovna,\r\nwith her free thoughtlessness, expressed her disapproval.\r\n\r\n"They get drunk, and kill unobjectionable young men. I should not\r\nforgive them on any account," she said.\r\n\r\n"Now, that\'s a thing I cannot understand," said the Count.\r\n\r\n"I know that you never can understand what I say," the Countess began,\r\nand turning to Nekhludoff, she added:\r\n\r\n"Everybody understands except my husband. I say I am sorry for the\r\nmother, and I do not wish him to be contented, having killed a man."\r\nThen her son, who had been silent up to then, took the murderer\'s part,\r\nand rudely attacked his mother, arguing that an officer could not behave\r\nin any other way, because his fellow-officers would condemn him and turn\r\nhim out of the regiment. Nekhludoff listened to the conversation without\r\njoining in. Having been an officer himself, he understood, though he\r\ndid not agree with, young Tcharsky\'s arguments, and at the same time\r\nhe could not help contrasting the fate of the officer with that of a\r\nbeautiful young convict whom he had seen in the prison, and who was\r\ncondemned to the mines for having killed another in a fight. Both had\r\nturned murderers through drunkenness. The peasant had killed a man in\r\na moment of irritation, and he was parted from his wife and family, had\r\nchains on his legs, and his head shaved, and was going to hard labour in\r\nSiberia, while the officer was sitting in a fine room in the guardhouse,\r\neating a good dinner, drinking good wine, and reading books, and would\r\nbe set free in a day or two to live as he had done before, having only\r\nbecome more interesting by the affair. Nekhludoff said what he had been\r\nthinking, and at first his aunt, Katerina Ivanovna, seemed to agree with\r\nhim, but at last she became silent as the rest had done, and Nekhludoff\r\nfelt that he had committed something akin to an impropriety. In the\r\nevening, soon after dinner, the large hall, with high-backed carved\r\nchairs arranged in rows as for a meeting, and an armchair next to a\r\nlittle table, with a bottle of water for the speaker, began to fill\r\nwith people come to hear the foreigner, Kiesewetter, preach. Elegant\r\nequipages stopped at the front entrance. In the hall sat richly-dressed\r\nladies in silks and velvets and lace, with false hair and false busts\r\nand drawn-in waists, and among them men in uniform and evening dress,\r\nand about five persons of the common class, i.e., two men-servants, a\r\nshop-keeper, a footman, and a coachman. Kiesewetter, a thick-set, grisly\r\nman, spoke English, and a thin young girl, with a pince-nez, translated\r\nit into Russian promptly and well. He was saying that our sins were so\r\ngreat, the punishment for them so great and so unavoidable, that it was\r\nimpossible to live anticipating such punishment. "Beloved brothers and\r\nsisters, let us for a moment consider what we are doing, how we are\r\nliving, how we have offended against the all-loving Lord, and how\r\nwe make Christ suffer, and we cannot but understand that there is no\r\nforgiveness possible for us, no escape possible, that we are all doomed\r\nto perish. A terrible fate awaits us---everlasting torment," he said,\r\nwith tears in his trembling voice. "Oh, how can we be saved, brothers?\r\nHow can we be saved from this terrible, unquenchable fire? The house is\r\nin flames; there is no escape."\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a while, and real tears flowed down his cheeks. It\r\nwas for about eight years that each time when he got to this part of his\r\nspeech, which he himself liked so well, he felt a choking in his throat\r\nand an irritation in his nose, and the tears came in his eyes, and these\r\ntears touched him still more. Sobs were heard in the room. The Countess\r\nKaterina Ivanovna sat with her elbows on an inlaid table, leaning her\r\nhead on her hands, and her shoulders were shaking. The coachman looked\r\nwith fear and surprise at the foreigner, feeling as if he was about to\r\nrun him down with the pole of his carriage and the foreigner would\r\nnot move out of his way. All sat in positions similar to that Katerina\r\nIvanovna had assumed. Wolf\'s daughter, a thin, fashionably-dressed girl,\r\nvery like her father, knelt with her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nThe orator suddenly uncovered his face, and smiled a very real-looking\r\nsmile, such as actors express joy with, and began again with a sweet,\r\ngentle voice:\r\n\r\n"Yet there is a way to be saved. Here it is--a joyful, easy way. The\r\nsalvation is the blood shed for us by the only son of God, who gave\r\nhimself up to torments for our sake. His sufferings, His blood, will\r\nsave us. Brothers and sisters," he said, again with tears in his voice,\r\n"let us praise the Lord, who has given His only begotten son for the\r\nredemption of mankind. His holy blood . . ."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt so deeply disgusted that he rose silently, and frowning\r\nand keeping back a groan of shame, he left on tiptoe, and went to his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nOFFICIALDOM.\r\n\r\nHardly had Nekhludoff finished dressing the next morning, just as he\r\nwas about to go down, the footman brought him a card from the Moscow\r\nadvocate. The advocate had come to St. Petersburg on business of his\r\nown, and was going to be present when Maslova\'s case was examined in the\r\nSenate, if that would be soon. The telegram sent by Nekhludoff crossed\r\nhim on the way. Having found out from Nekhludoff when the case was going\r\nto be heard, and which senators were to be present, he smiled. "Exactly,\r\nall the three types of senators," he said. "Wolf is a Petersburg\r\nofficial; Skovorodnikoff is a theoretical, and Bay a practical lawyer,\r\nand therefore the most alive of them all," said the advocate. "There is\r\nmost hope of him. Well, and how about the Petition Committee?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m going to Baron Vorobioff to-day. I could not get an audience\r\nwith him yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Do you know why he is _Baron_ Vorobioff?" said the advocate, noticing\r\nthe slightly ironical stress that Nekhludoff put on this foreign title,\r\nfollowed by so very Russian a surname.\r\n\r\n"That was because the Emperor Paul rewarded the grandfather--I think he\r\nwas one of the Court footmen--by giving him this title. He managed to\r\nplease him in some way, so he made him a baron. \'It\'s my wish, so don\'t\r\ngainsay me!\' And so there\'s a _Baron_ Vorobioff, and very proud of the\r\ntitle. He is a dreadful old humbug."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m going to see him," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good; we can go together. I shall give you a lift."\r\n\r\nAs they were going to start, a footman met Nekhludoff in the ante-room,\r\nand handed him a note from Mariette:\r\n\r\n_Pour vous faire plaisir, f\'ai agi tout a fait contre mes principes et\r\nj\'ai intercede aupres de mon mari pour votre protegee. Il se trouve\r\nque cette personne pout etre relaxee immediatement. Mon mari a ecrit au\r\ncommandant. Venez donc disinterestedly. Je vous attends._\r\n\r\n                          _M._\r\n\r\n"Just fancy!" said Nekhludoff to the advocate. "Is this not dreadful?\r\nA woman whom they are keeping in solitary confinement for seven months\r\nturns out to be quite innocent, and only a word was needed to get her\r\nreleased."\r\n\r\n"That\'s always so. Well, anyhow, you have succeeded in getting what you\r\nwanted."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but this success grieves me. Just think what must be going on\r\nthere. Why have they been keeping her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s best not to look too deeply into it. Well, then, I shall give\r\nyou a lift, if I may," said the advocate, as they left the house, and\r\na fine carriage that the advocate had hired drove up to the door. "It\'s\r\nBaron Vorobioff you are going to see?"\r\n\r\nThe advocate gave the driver his directions, and the two good horses\r\nquickly brought Nekhludoff to the house in which the Baron lived. The\r\nBaron was at home. A young official in uniform, with a long, thin neck,\r\na much protruding Adam\'s apple, and an extremely light walk, and two\r\nladies were in the first room.\r\n\r\n"Your name, please?" the young man with the Adam\'s apple asked, stepping\r\nwith extreme lightness and grace across from the ladies to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff gave his name.\r\n\r\n"The Baron was just mentioning you," said the young man, the Baron\'s\r\nadjutant, and went out through an inner door. He returned, leading a\r\nweeping lady dressed in mourning. With her bony fingers the lady was\r\ntrying to pull her tangled veil over her face in order to hide her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Come in, please," said the young man to Nekhludoff, lightly stepping up\r\nto the door of the study and holding it open. When Nekhludoff came in,\r\nhe saw before him a thick-set man of medium height, with short hair,\r\nin a frock coat, who was sitting in an armchair opposite a large\r\nwriting-table, and looking gaily in front of himself. The kindly, rosy\r\nred face, striking by its contrast with the white hair, moustaches, and\r\nbeard, turned towards Nekhludoff with a friendly smile.\r\n\r\n"Very glad to see you. Your mother and I were old acquaintances and\r\nfriends. I have seen you as a boy, and later on as an officer. Sit\r\ndown and tell me what I can do for you. Yes, yes," he said, shaking his\r\ncropped white head, while Nekhludoff was telling him Theodosia\'s story.\r\n"Go on, go on. I quite understand. It is certainly very touching. And\r\nhave you handed in the petition?"\r\n\r\n"I have got the petition ready," Nekhludoff said, getting it out of his\r\npocket; "but I thought of speaking to you first in hopes that the case\r\nwould then get special attention paid to it."\r\n\r\n"You have done very well. I shall certainly report it myself," said the\r\nBaron, unsuccessfully trying to put an expression of pity on his merry\r\nface. "Very touching! It is clear she was but a child; the husband\r\ntreated her roughly, this repelled her, but as time went on they fell in\r\nlove with each other. Yes I will report the case."\r\n\r\n"Count Ivan Michaelovitch was also going to speak about it."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had hardly got these words out when the Baron\'s face changed.\r\n\r\n"You had better hand in the petition into the office, after all, and I\r\nshall do what I can," he said.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the young official again entered the room, evidently\r\nshowing off his elegant manner of walking.\r\n\r\n"That lady is asking if she may say a few words more."\r\n\r\n"Well, ask her in. Ah, mon cher, how many tears we have to see shed! If\r\nonly we could dry them all. One does all that lies within one\'s power."\r\n\r\nThe lady entered.\r\n\r\n"I forgot to ask you that he should not be allowed to give up the\r\ndaughter, because he is ready . . ."\r\n\r\n"But I have already told you that I should do all I can."\r\n\r\n"Baron, for the love of God! You will save the mother?"\r\n\r\nShe seized his hand, and began kissing it.\r\n\r\n"Everything shall be done."\r\n\r\nWhen the lady went out Nekhludoff also began to take leave.\r\n\r\n"We shall do what we can. I shall speak about it at the Ministry of\r\nJustice, and when we get their answer we shall do what we can."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff left the study, and went into the office again. Just as in\r\nthe Senate office, he saw, in a splendid apartment, a number of very\r\nelegant officials, clean, polite, severely correct and distinguished in\r\ndress and in speech.\r\n\r\n"How many there are of them; how very many and how well fed they all\r\nlook! And what clean shirts and hands they all have, and how well all\r\ntheir boots are polished! Who does it for them? How comfortable they\r\nall are, as compared not only with the prisoners, but even with the\r\npeasants!" These thoughts again involuntarily came to Nekhludoff\'s mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nAN OLD GENERAL OF REPUTE.\r\n\r\nThe man on whom depended the easing of the fate of the Petersburg\r\nprisoners was an old General of repute--a baron of German descent,\r\nwho, as it was said of him, had outlived his wits. He had received a\r\nprofusion of orders, but only wore one of them, the Order of the White\r\nCross. He had received this order, which he greatly valued, while\r\nserving in the Caucasus, because a number of Russian peasants, with\r\ntheir hair cropped, and dressed in uniform and armed with guns and\r\nbayonets, had killed at his command more than a thousand men who were\r\ndefending their liberty, their homes, and their families. Later on\r\nhe served in Poland, and there also made Russian peasants commit many\r\ndifferent crimes, and got more orders and decorations for his uniform.\r\nThen he served somewhere else, and now that he was a weak, old man\r\nhe had this position, which insured him a good house, an income and\r\nrespect. He strictly observed all the regulations which were prescribed\r\n"from above," and was very zealous in the fulfilment of these\r\nregulations, to which he ascribed a special importance, considering that\r\neverything else in the world might be changed except the regulations\r\nprescribed "from above." His duty was to keep political prisoners,\r\nmen and women, in solitary confinement in such a way that half of them\r\nperished in 10 years\' time, some going out of their minds, some dying\r\nof consumption, some committing suicide by starving themselves to death,\r\ncutting their veins with bits of glass, hanging, or burning themselves\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nThe old General was not ignorant of this; it all happened within his\r\nknowledge; but these cases no more touched his conscience than accidents\r\nbrought on by thunderstorms, floods, etc. These cases occurred as a\r\nconsequence of the fulfilment of regulations prescribed "from above" by\r\nHis Imperial Majesty. These regulations had to be carried out\r\nwithout fail, and therefore it was absolutely useless to think of the\r\nconsequences of their fulfilment. The old General did not even allow\r\nhimself to think of such things, counting it his patriotic duty as a\r\nsoldier not to think of them for fear of getting weak in the carrying\r\nout of these, according to his opinion, very important obligations. Once\r\na week the old General made the round of the cells, one of the duties of\r\nhis position, and asked the prisoners if they had any requests to make.\r\nThe prisoners had all sorts of requests. He listened to them quietly, in\r\nimpenetrable silence, and never fulfilled any of their requests, because\r\nthey were all in disaccord with the regulations. Just as Nekhludoff\r\ndrove up to the old General\'s house, the high notes of the bells on the\r\nbelfry clock chimed "Great is the Lord," and then struck two. The sound\r\nof these chimes brought back to Nekhludoff\'s mind what he had read\r\nin the notes of the Decembrists [the Decembrists were a group who\r\nattempted, but failed, to put an end to absolutism in Russia at the time\r\nof the accession of Nicholas the First] about the way this sweet music\r\nrepeated every hour re-echoes in the hearts of those imprisoned for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old General was sitting in his darkened drawing-room at\r\nan inlaid table, turning a saucer on a piece of paper with the aid of\r\na young artist, the brother of one of his subordinates. The thin,\r\nweak, moist fingers of the artist were pressed against the wrinkled and\r\nstiff-jointed fingers of the old General, and the hands joined in this\r\nmanner were moving together with the saucer over a paper that had all\r\nthe letters of the alphabet written on it. The saucer was answering the\r\nquestions put by the General as to how souls will recognise each other\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff sent in his card by an orderly acting as footman, the\r\nsoul of Joan of Arc was speaking by the aid of the saucer. The soul of\r\nJoan of Arc had already spelt letter by letter the words: "They well\r\nknew each other," and these words had been written down. When the\r\norderly came in the saucer had stopped first on b, then on y, and began\r\njerking hither and thither. This jerking was caused by the General\'s\r\nopinion that the next letter should be b, i.e., Joan of Arc ought to\r\nsay that the souls will know each other by being cleansed of all that\r\nis earthly, or something of the kind, clashing with the opinion of the\r\nartist, who thought the next letter should be l, i.e., that the souls\r\nshould know each other by light emanating from their astral bodies. The\r\nGeneral, with his bushy grey eyebrows gravely contracted, sat gazing at\r\nthe hands on the saucer, and, imagining that it was moving of its own\r\naccord, kept pulling the saucer towards b. The pale-faced young artist,\r\nwith his thin hair combed back behind his cars, was looking with his\r\nlifeless blue eyes into a dark corner of the drawing-room, nervously\r\nmoving his lips and pulling the saucer towards l.\r\n\r\nThe General made a wry face at the interruption, but after a moment\'s\r\npause he took the card, put on his pince-nez, and, uttering a groan,\r\nrose, in spite of the pain in his back, to his full height, rubbing his\r\nnumb fingers.\r\n\r\n"Ask him into the study."\r\n\r\n"With your excellency\'s permission I will finish it alone," said the\r\nartist, rising. "I feel the presence."\r\n\r\n"All right, finish alone," the General said, severely and decidedly, and\r\nstepped quickly, with big, firm and measured strides, into his study.\r\n\r\n"Very pleased to see you," said the General to Nekhludoff, uttering the\r\nfriendly words in a gruff tone, and pointing to an armchair by the side\r\nof the writing-table. "Have you been in Petersburg long?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff replied that he had only lately arrived.\r\n\r\n"Is the Princess, your mother, well?"\r\n\r\n"My mother is dead."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me; I am very sorry. My son told me he had met you."\r\n\r\nThe General\'s son was making the same kind of career for himself that\r\nthe father had done, and, having passed the Military Academy, was now\r\nserving in the Inquiry Office, and was very proud of his duties there.\r\nHis occupation was the management of Government spies.\r\n\r\n"Why, I served with your father. We were friends--comrades. And you; are\r\nyou also in the Service?"\r\n\r\n"No, I am not."\r\n\r\nThe General bent his head disapprovingly.\r\n\r\n"I have a request to make, General."\r\n\r\n"Very pleased. In what way can I be of service to you?"\r\n\r\n"If my request is out of place pray pardon me. But I am obliged to make\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"There is a certain Gourkevitch imprisoned in the fortress; his mother\r\nasks for an interview with him, or at least to be allowed to send him\r\nsome books."\r\n\r\nThe General expressed neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction at\r\nNekhludoff\'s request, but bending his head on one side he closed his\r\neyes as if considering. In reality he was not considering anything, and\r\nwas not even interested in Nekhludoff\'s questions, well knowing that he\r\nwould answer them according to the law. He was simply resting mentally\r\nand not thinking at all.\r\n\r\n"You see," he said at last, "this does not depend on me. There is a\r\nregulation, confirmed by His Majesty, concerning interviews; and as to\r\nbooks, we have a library, and they may have what is permitted."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he wants scientific books; he wishes to study."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe it," growled the General. "It\'s not study he wants;\r\nit is just only restlessness."\r\n\r\n"But what is to be done? They must occupy their time somehow in their\r\nhard condition," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"They are always complaining," said the General. "We know them."\r\n\r\nHe spoke of them in a general way, as if they were all a specially bad\r\nrace of men. "They have conveniences here which can be found in few\r\nplaces of confinement," said the General, and he began to enumerate the\r\ncomforts the prisoners enjoyed, as if the aim of the institution was to\r\ngive the people imprisoned there a comfortable home.\r\n\r\n"It is true it used to be rather rough, but now they are very well kept\r\nhere," he continued. "They have three courses for dinner--and one of\r\nthem meat--cutlets, or rissoles; and on Sundays they get a fourth--a\r\nsweet dish. God grant every Russian may eat as well as they do."\r\n\r\nLike all old people, the General, having once got on to a familiar\r\ntopic, enumerated the various proofs he had often given before of the\r\nprisoners being exacting and ungrateful.\r\n\r\n"They get books on spiritual subjects and old journals. We have a\r\nlibrary. Only they rarely read. At first they seem interested, later on\r\nthe new books remain uncut, and the old ones with their leaves unturned.\r\nWe tried them," said the old General, with the dim likeness of a smile.\r\n"We put bits of paper in on purpose, which remained just as they had\r\nbeen placed. Writing is also not forbidden," he continued. "A slate is\r\nprovided, and a slate pencil, so that they can write as a pastime. They\r\ncan wipe the slate and write again. But they don\'t write, either. Oh,\r\nthey very soon get quite tranquil. At first they seem restless, but\r\nlater on they even grow fat and become very quiet." Thus spoke the\r\nGeneral, never suspecting the terrible meaning of his words.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff listened to the hoarse old voice, looked at the stiff limbs,\r\nthe swollen eyelids under the grey brows, at the old, clean-shaved,\r\nflabby jaw, supported by the collar of the military uniform, at the\r\nwhite cross that this man was so proud of, chiefly because he had gained\r\nit by exceptionally cruel and extensive slaughter, and knew that it was\r\nuseless to reply to the old man or to explain the meaning of his own\r\nwords to him.\r\n\r\nHe made another effort, and asked about the prisoner Shoustova, for\r\nwhose release, as he had been informed that morning, orders were given.\r\n\r\n"Shoustova--Shoustova? I cannot remember all their names, there are so\r\nmany of them," he said, as if reproaching them because there were so\r\nmany. He rang, and ordered the secretary to be called. While waiting for\r\nthe latter, he began persuading Nekhludoff to serve, saying that "honest\r\nnoblemen," counting himself among the number, "were particularly needed\r\nby the Tsar and--the country," he added, evidently only to round off\r\nhis sentence. "I am old, yet I am serving still, as well as my strength\r\nallows."\r\n\r\nThe secretary, a dry, emaciated man, with restless, intelligent eyes,\r\ncame in and reported that Shoustova was imprisoned in some queer,\r\nfortified place, and that he had received no orders concerning her.\r\n\r\n"When we get the order we shall let her out the same day. We do not keep\r\nthem; we do not value their visits much," said the General, with another\r\nattempt at a playful smile, which only distorted his old face.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff rose, trying to keep from expressing the mixed feelings of\r\nrepugnance and pity which he felt towards this terrible old man. The\r\nold man on his part considered that he should not be too severe on the\r\nthoughtless and evidently misguided son of his old comrade, and should\r\nnot leave him without advice.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, my dear fellow; do not take it amiss. It is my affection that\r\nmakes me say it. Do not keep company with such people as we have at our\r\nplace here. There are no innocent ones among them. All these people\r\nare most immoral. We know them," he said, in a tone that admitted no\r\npossibility of doubt. And he did not doubt, not because the thing was\r\nso, but because if it was not so, he would have to admit himself to\r\nbe not a noble hero living out the last days of a good life, but a\r\nscoundrel, who sold, and still continued in his old age to sell, his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n"Best of all, go and serve," he continued; "the Tsar needs honest\r\nmen--and the country," he added. "Well, supposing I and the others\r\nrefused to serve, as you are doing? Who would be left? Here we are,\r\nfinding fault with the order of things, and yet not wishing to help the\r\nGovernment."\r\n\r\nWith a deep sigh Nekhludoff made a low bow, shook the large, bony hand\r\ncondescendingly stretched out to him and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe General shook his head reprovingly, and rubbing his back, he again\r\nwent into the drawing-room where the artist was waiting for him. He had\r\nalready written down the answer given by the soul of Joan of Arc. The\r\nGeneral put on his pince-nez and read, "Will know one another by light\r\nemanating from their astral bodies."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the General, with approval, and closed his eyes. "But how is\r\none to know if the light of all is alike?" he asked, and again crossed\r\nfingers with the artist on the saucer.\r\n\r\nThe isvostchik drove Nekhludoff out of the gate.\r\n\r\nIt is dull here, sir, he said, turning to Nekhludoff. "I almost wished\r\nto drive off without waiting for you."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff agreed. "Yes, it is dull," and he took a deep breath, and\r\nlooked up with a sense of relief at the grey clouds that were floating\r\nin the sky, and at the glistening ripples made by the boats and steamers\r\non the Neva.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA\'S APPEAL.\r\n\r\nThe next day Maslova\'s case was to be examined at the Senate, and\r\nNekhludoff and the advocate met at the majestic portal of the building,\r\nwhere several carriages were waiting. Ascending the magnificent and\r\nimposing staircase to the first floor, the advocate, who knew all the\r\nins and outs of the place, turned to the left and entered through a door\r\nwhich had the date of the introduction of the Code of Laws above it.\r\n\r\nAfter taking off his overcoat in the first narrow room, he found out\r\nfrom the attendant that the Senators had all arrived, and that the last\r\nhad just come in. Fanarin, in his swallow-tail coat, a white tie above\r\nthe white shirt-front, and a self-confident smile on his lips, passed\r\ninto the next room. In this room there were to the right a large\r\ncupboard and a table, and to the left a winding staircase, which an\r\nelegant official in uniform was descending with a portfolio under his\r\narm. In this room an old man with long, white hair and a patriarchal\r\nappearance attracted every one\'s attention. He wore a short coat and\r\ngrey trousers. Two attendants stood respectfully beside him. The old man\r\nwith white hair entered the cupboard and shut himself in.\r\n\r\nFanarin noticed a fellow-advocate dressed in the same way as himself,\r\nwith a white tie and dress coat, and at once entered into an animated\r\nconversation with him.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was meanwhile examining the people in the room. The public\r\nconsisted of about 15 persons, of whom two were ladies--a young one with\r\na pince-nez, and an old, grey-haired one.\r\n\r\nA case of libel was to be heard that day, and therefore the public were\r\nmore numerous than usual--chiefly persons belonging to the journalistic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe usher, a red-cheeked, handsome man in a fine uniform, came up to\r\nFanarin and asked him what his business was. When he heard that it was\r\nthe case of Maslova, he noted something down and walked away. Then the\r\ncupboard door opened and the old man with the patriarchal appearance\r\nstepped out, no longer in a short coat but in a gold-trimmed attire,\r\nwhich made him look like a bird, and with metal plates on his\r\nbreast. This funny costume seemed to make the old man himself feel\r\nuncomfortable, and, walking faster than his wont, he hurried out of the\r\ndoor opposite the entrance.\r\n\r\n"That is Bay, a most estimable man," Fanarin said to Nekhludoff, and\r\nthen having introduced him to his colleague, he explained the case that\r\nwas about to be heard, which he considered very interesting.\r\n\r\nThe hearing of the case soon commenced, and Nekhludoff, with the\r\npublic, entered the left side of the Senate Chamber. They all, including\r\nFanarin, took their places behind a grating. Only the Petersburg\r\nadvocate went up to a desk in front of the grating.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Chamber was not so big as the Criminal Court; and was more\r\nsimply furnished, only the table in front of the senators was covered\r\nwith crimson, gold-trimmed velvet, instead of green cloth; but the\r\nattributes of all places of judgment, i.e., the mirror of justice, the\r\nicon, the emblem of hypocrisy, and the Emperor\'s portrait, the emblem of\r\nservility, were there.\r\n\r\nThe usher announced, in the same solemn manner: "The Court is coming."\r\nEvery one rose in the same way, and the senators entered in their\r\nuniforms and sat down on highbacked chairs and leant on the table,\r\ntrying to appear natural, just in the same way as the judges in the\r\nCourt of Law. There were four senators present--Nikitin, who took the\r\nchair, a clean-shaved man with a narrow face and steely eyes; Wolf, with\r\nsignificantly compressed lips, and little white hands, with which he\r\nkept turning over the pages of the business papers; Skovorodnikoff,\r\na heavy, fat, pockmarked man--the learned lawyer; and Bay, the\r\npatriarchal-looking man who had arrived last.\r\n\r\nWith the advocates entered the chief secretary and public prosecutor, a\r\nlean, clean-shaven young man of medium height, a very dark complexion,\r\nand sad, black eyes. Nekhludoff knew him at once, in spite of his\r\ncurious uniform and the fact that he had not seen him for six years. He\r\nhad been one of his best friends in Nekhludoff\'s student days.\r\n\r\n"The public prosecutor Selenin?" Nekhludoff asked, turning to the\r\nadvocate.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Why?"\r\n\r\n"I know him well. He is a fine fellow."\r\n\r\n"And a good public prosecutor; business-like. Now he is the man you\r\nshould have interested."\r\n\r\n"He will act according to his conscience in any case," said Nekhludoff,\r\nrecalling the intimate relations and friendship between himself and\r\nSelenin, and the attractive qualities of the latter--purity, honesty,\r\nand good breeding in its best sense.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is no time now," whispered Fanarin, who was listening to the\r\nreport of the case that had commenced.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Justice was accused of having left a decision of the Court\r\nof Law unaltered.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff listened and tried to make out the meaning of what was going\r\non; but, just as in the Criminal Court, his chief difficulty was\r\nthat not the evidently chief point, but some side issues, were being\r\ndiscussed. The case was that of a newspaper which had published the\r\naccount of a swindle arranged by a director of a limited liability\r\ncompany. It seemed that the only important question was whether the\r\ndirector of the company really abused his trust, and how to stop him\r\nfrom doing it. But the questions under consideration were whether the\r\neditor had a right to publish this article of his contributor, and what\r\nhe had been guilty of in publishing it: slander or libel, and in what\r\nway slander included libel, or libel included slander, and something\r\nrather incomprehensible to ordinary people about all sorts of statutes\r\nand resolutions passed by some General Department.\r\n\r\nThe only thing clear to Nekhludoff was that, in spite of what Wolf had\r\nso strenuously insisted on, the day before, i.e., that the Senate could\r\nnot try a case on its merits, in this case he was evidently strongly\r\nin favour of repealing the decision of the Court of Justice, and that\r\nSelenin, in spite of his characteristic reticence, stated the opposite\r\nopinion with quite unexpected warmth. The warmth, which surprised\r\nNekhludoff, evinced by the usually self-controlled Selenin, was due to\r\nhis knowledge of the director\'s shabbiness in money matters, and the\r\nfact, which had accidentally come to his cars, that Wolf had been to a\r\nswell dinner party at the swindler\'s house only a few days before.\r\n\r\nNow that Wolf spoke on the case, guardedly enough, but with evident\r\nbias, Selenin became excited, and expressed his opinion with too much\r\nnervous irritation for an ordinary business transaction.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Selenin\'s speech had offended Wolf. He grew red, moved\r\nin his chair, made silent gestures of surprise, and at last rose, with\r\na very dignified and injured look, together with the other senators, and\r\nwent out into the debating-room.\r\n\r\n"What particular case have you come about?" the usher asked again,\r\naddressing Fanarin.\r\n\r\n"I have already told you: Maslova\'s case."\r\n\r\n"Yes, quite so. It is to be heard to-day, but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?" the advocate asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, this case was to be examined without taking sides,\r\nso that the senators will hardly come out again after passing the\r\nresolution. But I will inform them."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll inform them; I\'ll inform them." And the usher again put something\r\ndown on his paper.\r\n\r\nThe Senators really meant to pronounce their decision concerning the\r\nlibel case, and then to finish the other business, Maslova\'s case among\r\nit, over their tea and cigarettes, without leaving the debating-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE APPEAL DISMISSED.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Senators were seated round the table in the\r\ndebating-room, Wolf began to bring forward with great animation all the\r\nmotives in favour of a repeal. The chairman, an ill-natured man at\r\nbest, was in a particularly bad humour that day. His thoughts were\r\nconcentrated on the words he had written down in his memoranda on the\r\noccasion when not he but Viglanoff was appointed to the important post\r\nhe had long coveted. It was the chairman, Nikitin\'s, honest conviction\r\nthat his opinions of the officials of the two upper classes with which\r\nhe was in connection would furnish valuable material for the historians.\r\nHe had written a chapter the day before in which the officials of the\r\nupper classes got it hot for preventing him, as he expressed it, from\r\naverting the ruin towards which the present rulers of Russia were\r\ndriving it, which simply meant that they had prevented his getting a\r\nbetter salary. And now he was considering what a new light to posterity\r\nthis chapter would shed on events.\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," he said, in reply to the words addressed to him by\r\nWolf, without listening to them.\r\n\r\nBay was listening to Wolf with a sad face and drawing a garland on the\r\npaper that lay before him. Bay was a Liberal of the very first water. He\r\nheld sacred the Liberal traditions of the sixth decade of this century,\r\nand if he ever overstepped the limits of strict neutrality it was always\r\nin the direction of Liberalism. So in this case; beside the fact that\r\nthe swindling director, who was prosecuting for libel, was a bad lot,\r\nthe prosecution of a journalist for libel in itself tending, as it did,\r\nto restrict the freedom of the press, inclined Bay to reject the appeal.\r\n\r\nWhen Wolf concluded his arguments Bay stopped drawing his garland and\r\nbegan in a sad and gentle voice (he was sad because he was obliged to\r\ndemonstrate such truisms) concisely, simply and convincingly to show\r\nhow unfounded the accusation was, and then, bending his white head, he\r\ncontinued drawing his garland.\r\n\r\nSkovorodnikoff, who sat opposite Wolf, and, with his fat fingers, kept\r\nshoving his beard and moustaches into his mouth, stopped chewing his\r\nbeard as soon as Bay was silent, and said with a loud, grating voice,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the fact of the director being a terrible\r\nscoundrel, he would have been for the repeal of the sentence if there\r\nwere any legal reasons for it; but, as there were none, he was of Bay\'s\r\nopinion. He was glad to put this spoke in Wolf\'s wheel.\r\n\r\nThe chairman agreed with Skovorodnikoff, and the appeal was rejected.\r\n\r\nWolf was dissatisfied, especially because it was like being caught\r\nacting with dishonest partiality; so he pretended to be indifferent,\r\nand, unfolding the document which contained Maslova\'s case, he became\r\nengrossed in it. Meanwhile the Senators rang and ordered tea, and began\r\ntalking about the event that, together with the duel, was occupying the\r\nPetersburgers.\r\n\r\nIt was the case of the chief of a Government department, who was accused\r\nof the crime provided for in Statute 995.\r\n\r\n"What nastiness," said Bay, with disgust.\r\n\r\n"Why; where is the harm of it? I can show you a Russian book containing\r\nthe project of a German writer, who openly proposes that it should not\r\nbe considered a crime," said Skovorodnikoff, drawing in greedily the\r\nfumes of the crumpled cigarette, which he held between his fingers close\r\nto the palm, and he laughed boisterously.\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" said Bay.\r\n\r\n"I shall show it you," said Skovorodnikoff, giving the full title of the\r\nbook, and even its date and the name of its editor.\r\n\r\n"I hear he has been appointed governor to some town in Siberia."\r\n\r\n"That\'s fine. The archdeacon will meet him with a crucifix. They ought\r\nto appoint an archdeacon of the same sort," said Skovorodnikoff. "I\r\ncould recommend them one," and he threw the end of his cigarette into\r\nhis saucer, and again shoved as much of his beard and moustaches as he\r\ncould into his mouth and began chewing them.\r\n\r\nThe usher came in and reported the advocate\'s and Nekhludoff\'s desire to\r\nbe present at the examination of Maslova\'s case.\r\n\r\n"This case," Wolf said, "is quite romantic," and he told them what he\r\nknew about Nekhludoff\'s relations with Maslova. When they had spoken\r\na little about it and finished their tea and cigarettes, the Senators\r\nreturned into the Senate Chamber and proclaimed their decision in the\r\nlibel case, and began to hear Maslova\'s case.\r\n\r\nWolf, in his thin voice, reported Maslova\'s appeal very fully, but\r\nagain not without some bias and an evident wish for the repeal of the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything to add?" the chairman said, turning to Fanarin.\r\nFanarin rose, and standing with his broad white chest expanded, proved\r\npoint by point, with wonderful exactness and persuasiveness, how the\r\nCourt had in six points strayed from the exact meaning of the law; and\r\nbesides this he touched, though briefly, on the merits of the case, and\r\non the crying injustice of the sentence. The tone of his speech was one\r\nof apology to the Senators, who, with their penetration and judicial\r\nwisdom, could not help seeing and understanding it all better than he\r\ncould. He was obliged to speak only because the duty he had undertaken\r\nforced him to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter Fanarin\'s speech one might have thought that there could not\r\nremain the least doubt that the Senate ought to repeal the decision of\r\nthe Court. When he had finished his speech, Fanarin looked round with a\r\nsmile of triumph, seeing which Nekhludoff felt certain that the case was\r\nwon. But when he looked at the Senators he saw that Fanarin smiled and\r\ntriumphed all alone. The Senators and the Public Prosecutor did not\r\nsmile nor triumph, but looked like people wearied, and who were thinking\r\n"We have often heard the like of you; it is all in vain," and were only\r\ntoo glad when he stopped and ceased uselessly detaining them there.\r\nImmediately after the end of the advocate\'s speech the chairman turned\r\nto the Public Prosecutor. Selenin briefly and clearly expressed\r\nhimself in favour of leaving the decision of the Court unaltered, as\r\nhe considered all the reasons for appealing inadequate. After this the\r\nSenators went out into the debating-room. They were divided in their\r\nopinions. Wolf was in favour of altering the decision. Bay, when he\r\nhad understood the case, took up the same side with fervour, vividly\r\npresenting the scene at the court to his companions as he clearly saw it\r\nhimself. Nikitin, who always was on the side of severity and formality,\r\ntook up the other side. All depended on Skovorodnikoff\'s vote, and he\r\nvoted for rejecting the appeal, because Nekhludoff\'s determination to\r\nmarry the woman on moral grounds was extremely repugnant to him.\r\n\r\nSkovorodnikoff was a materialist, a Darwinian, and counted every\r\nmanifestation of abstract morality, or, worse still, religion, not only\r\nas a despicable folly, but as a personal affront to himself. All this\r\nbother about a prostitute, and the presence of a celebrated advocate and\r\nNekhludoff in the Senate were in the highest degree repugnant to him.\r\nSo he shoved his beard into his mouth and made faces, and very skilfully\r\npretended to know nothing of this case, excepting that the reasons for\r\nan appeal were insufficient, and that he, therefore, agreed with the\r\nchairman to leave the decision of the Court unaltered.\r\n\r\nSo the sentence remained unrepealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nAN OLD FRIEND.\r\n\r\n"Terrible," said Nekhludoff, as he went out into the waiting-room with\r\nthe advocate, who was arranging the papers in his portfolio. "In a\r\nmatter which is perfectly clear they attach all the importance to the\r\nform and reject the appeal. Terrible!"\r\n\r\n"The case was spoiled in the Criminal Court," said the advocate.\r\n\r\n"And Selenin, too, was in favour of the rejection. Terrible! terrible!"\r\nNekhludoff repeated. "What is to be done now?"\r\n\r\n"We will appeal to His Majesty, and you can hand in the petition\r\nyourself while you are here. I will write it for you."\r\n\r\nAt this moment little Wolf, with his stars and uniform, came out into\r\nthe waiting-room and approached Nekhludoff. "It could not be helped,\r\ndear Prince. The reasons for an appeal were not sufficient," he said,\r\nshrugging his narrow shoulders and closing his eyes, and then he went\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nAfter Wolf, Selenin came out too, having heard from the Senators that\r\nhis old friend Nekhludoff was there.\r\n\r\n"Well, I never expected to see you here," he said, coming up to\r\nNekhludoff, and smiling only with his lips while his eyes remained sad.\r\n"I did not know you were in Petersburg."\r\n\r\n"And I did not know you were Public Prosecutor-in-Chief."\r\n\r\n"How is it you are in the Senate?" asked Selenin. "I had heard, by the\r\nway, that you were in Petersburg. But what are you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Here? I am here because I hoped to find justice and save a woman\r\ninnocently condemned."\r\n\r\n"What woman?"\r\n\r\n"The one whose case has just been decided."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Maslova\'s case," said Selenin, suddenly remembering it. "The appeal\r\nhad no grounds whatever."\r\n\r\n"It is not the appeal; it\'s the woman who is innocent, and is being\r\npunished."\r\n\r\nSelenin sighed. "That may well be, but----"\r\n\r\n"Not _may be_, but is."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?"\r\n\r\n"Because I was on the jury. I know how we made the mistake."\r\n\r\nSelenin became thoughtful. "You should have made a statement at the\r\ntime," he said.\r\n\r\n"I did make the statement."\r\n\r\n"It should have been put down in an official report. If this had been\r\nadded to the petition for the appeal--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but still, as it is, the verdict is evidently absurd."\r\n\r\n"The Senate has no right to say so. If the Senate took upon itself to\r\nrepeal the decision of the law courts according to its own views as\r\nto the justice of the decisions in themselves, the verdict of the jury\r\nwould lose all its meaning, not to mention that the Senate would have\r\nno basis to go upon, and would run the risk of infringing justice rather\r\nthan upholding it," said Selenin, calling to mind the case that had just\r\nbeen heard.\r\n\r\n"All I know is that this woman is quite innocent, and that the last\r\nhope of saving her from an unmerited punishment is gone. The grossest\r\ninjustice has been confirmed by the highest court."\r\n\r\n"It has not been confirmed. The Senate did not and cannot enter into\r\nthe merits of the case in itself," said Selenin. Always busy and rarely\r\ngoing out into society, he had evidently heard nothing of Nekhludoff\'s\r\nromance. Nekhludoff noticed it, and made up his mind that it was best to\r\nsay nothing about his special relations with Maslova.\r\n\r\n"You are probably staying with your aunt," Selenin remarked, apparently\r\nwishing to change the subject. "She told me you were here yesterday, and\r\nshe invited me to meet you in the evening, when some foreign preacher\r\nwas to lecture," and Selenin again smiled only with his lips.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was there, but left in disgust," said Nekhludoff angrily, vexed\r\nthat Selenin had changed the subject.\r\n\r\n"Why with disgust? After all, it is a manifestation of religious\r\nfeeling, though one-sided and sectarian," said Selenin.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s only some kind of whimsical folly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no. The curious thing is that we know the teaching of our\r\nchurch so little that we see some new kind of revelation in what are,\r\nafter all, our own fundamental dogmas," said Selenin, as if hurrying to\r\nlet his old friend know his new views.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked at Selenin scrutinisingly and with surprise, and\r\nSelenin dropped his eyes, in which appeared an expression not only of\r\nsadness but also of ill-will.\r\n\r\n"Do you, then, believe in the dogmas of the church?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," replied Selenin, gazing straight into Nekhludoff\'s\r\neyes with a lifeless look.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sighed. "It is strange," he said.\r\n\r\n"However, we shall have a talk some other time," said Selenin. "I\r\nam coming," he added, in answer to the usher, who had respectfully\r\napproached him. "Yes, we must meet again," he went on with a sigh. "But\r\nwill it be possible for me to find you? You will always find me in at\r\nseven o\'clock. My address is Nadejdinskaya," and he gave the number.\r\n"Ah, time does not stand still," and he turned to go, smiling only with\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n"I will come if I can," said Nekhludoff, feeling that a man once\r\nnear and dear to him had, by this brief conversation, suddenly become\r\nstrange, distant, and incomprehensible, if not hostile to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff knew Selenin as a student, he was a good son, a true\r\nfriend, and for his years an educated man of the world, with much tact;\r\nelegant, handsome, and at the same time truthful and honest. He learned\r\nwell, without much exertion and with no pedantry, receiving gold medals\r\nfor his essays. He considered the service of mankind, not only in words\r\nbut in acts, to be the aim of his young life. He saw no other way of\r\nbeing useful to humanity than by serving the State. Therefore, as soon\r\nas he had completed his studies, he systematically examined all the\r\nactivities to which he might devote his life, and decided to enter the\r\nSecond Department of the Chancellerie, where the laws are drawn up, and\r\nhe did so. But, in spite of the most scrupulous and exact discharge of\r\nthe duties demanded of him, this service gave no satisfaction to his\r\ndesire of being useful, nor could he awake in himself the consciousness\r\nthat he was doing "the right thing."\r\n\r\nThis dissatisfaction was so much increased by the friction with his very\r\nsmall-minded and vain fellow officials that he left the Chancellerie and\r\nentered the Senate. It was better there, but the same dissatisfaction\r\nstill pursued him; he felt it to be very different from what he had\r\nexpected, and from what ought to be.\r\n\r\nAnd now that he was in the Senate his relatives obtained for him the\r\npost of Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and he had to go in a carriage,\r\ndressed in an embroidered uniform and a white linen apron, to thank\r\nall sorts of people for having placed him in the position of a lackey.\r\nHowever much he tried he could find no reasonable explanation for the\r\nexistence of this post, and felt, more than in the Senate, that it\r\nwas not "the right thing," and yet he could not refuse it for fear of\r\nhurting those who felt sure they were giving him much pleasure by this\r\nappointment, and because it flattered the lowest part of his nature. It\r\npleased him to see himself in a mirror in his gold-embroidered uniform,\r\nand to accept the deference paid him by some people because of his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same kind happened when he married. A very brilliant\r\nmatch, from a worldly point of view, was arranged for him, and he\r\nmarried chiefly because by refusing he would have had to hurt the\r\nyoung lady who wished to be married to him, and those who arranged the\r\nmarriage, and also because a marriage with a nice young girl of noble\r\nbirth flattered his vanity and gave him pleasure. But this marriage\r\nvery soon proved to be even less "the right thing" than the Government\r\nservice and his position at Court.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth of her first child the wife decided to have no more,\r\nand began leading that luxurious worldly life in which he now had to\r\nparticipate whether he liked or not.\r\n\r\nShe was not particularly handsome, and was faithful to him, and she\r\nseemed, in spite of all the efforts it cost her, to derive nothing but\r\nweariness from the life she led, yet she perseveringly continued to live\r\nit, though it was poisoning her husband\'s life. And all his efforts\r\nto alter this life was shattered, as against a stone wall, by her\r\nconviction, which all her friends and relatives supported, that all was\r\nas it should be.\r\n\r\nThe child, a little girl with bare legs and long golden curls, was a\r\nbeing perfectly foreign to him, chiefly because she was trained quite\r\notherwise than he wished her to be. There sprung up between the husband\r\nand wife the usual misunderstanding, without even the wish to understand\r\neach other, and then a silent warfare, hidden from outsiders and\r\ntempered by decorum. All this made his life at home a burden, and became\r\neven less "the right thing" than his service and his post.\r\n\r\nBut it was above all his attitude towards religion which was not "the\r\nright thing." Like every one of his set and his time, by the growth of\r\nhis reason he broke without the least effort the nets of the religious\r\nsuperstitions in which he was brought up, and did not himself exactly\r\nknow when it was that he freed himself of them. Being earnest and\r\nupright, he did not, during his youth and intimacy with Nekhludoff as a\r\nstudent, conceal his rejection of the State religion. But as years\r\nwent on and he rose in the service, and especially at the time of the\r\nreaction towards conservatism in society, his spiritual freedom stood in\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nAt home, when his father died, he had to be present at the masses\r\nsaid for his soul, and his mother wished him to go to confession or to\r\ncommunion, and it was in a way expected, by public opinion, but above\r\nall, Government service demanded that he should be present at all sorts\r\nof services, consecrations, thanksgivings, and the like. Hardly a day\r\npassed without some outward religious form having to be observed.\r\n\r\nWhen present at these services he had to pretend that he believed in\r\nsomething which he did not believe in, and being truthful he could not\r\ndo this. The alternative was, having made up his mind that all these\r\noutward signs were deceitful, to alter his life in such a way that he\r\nwould not have to be present at such ceremonials. But to do what\r\nseemed so simple would have cost a great deal. Besides encountering the\r\nperpetual hostility of all those who were near to him, he would have to\r\ngive up the service and his position, and sacrifice his hopes of being\r\nuseful to humanity by his service, now and in the future. To make such a\r\nsacrifice one would have to be firmly convinced of being right.\r\n\r\nAnd he was firmly convinced he was right, as no educated man of our\r\ntime can help being convinced who knows a little history and how the\r\nreligions, and especially Church Christianity, originated.\r\n\r\nBut under the stress of his daily life he, a truthful man, allowed a\r\nlittle falsehood to creep in. He said that in order to do justice to\r\nan unreasonable thing one had to study the unreasonable thing. It was a\r\nlittle falsehood, but it sunk him into the big falsehood in which he was\r\nnow caught.\r\n\r\nBefore putting to himself the question whether the orthodoxy in which\r\nhe was born and bred, and which every one expected him to accept, and\r\nwithout which he could not continue his useful occupation, contained the\r\ntruth, he had already decided the answer. And to clear up the question\r\nhe did not read Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Herbert Spencer, or Comte, but\r\nthe philosophical works of Hegel and the religious works of Vinet and\r\nKhomyakoff, and naturally found in them what he wanted, i.e., something\r\nlike peace of mind and a vindication of that religious teaching in which\r\nhe was educated, which his reason had long ceased to accept, but without\r\nwhich his whole life was filled with unpleasantness which could all be\r\nremoved by accepting the teaching.\r\n\r\nAnd so he adopted all the usual sophistries which go to prove that\r\na single human reason cannot know the truth, that the truth is only\r\nrevealed to an association of men, and can only be known by revelation,\r\nthat revelation is kept by the church, etc. And so he managed to be\r\npresent at prayers, masses for the dead, to confess, make signs of the\r\ncross in front of icons, with a quiet mind, without being conscious of\r\nthe lie, and to continue in the service which gave him the feeling of\r\nbeing useful and some comfort in his joyless family life. Although he\r\nbelieved this, he felt with his entire being that this religion of his,\r\nmore than all else, was not "the right thing," and that is why his eyes\r\nalways looked sad.\r\n\r\nAnd seeing Nekhludoff, whom he had known before all these lies had\r\nrooted themselves within him, reminded him of what he then was. It was\r\nespecially after he had hurried to hint at his religious views that he\r\nhad most strongly felt all this "not the right thing," and had become\r\npainfully sad. Nekhludoff felt it also after the first joy of meeting\r\nhis old friend had passed, and therefore, though they promised each\r\nother to meet, they did not take any steps towards an interview, and did\r\nnot again see each other during this stay of Nekhludoff\'s in Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMARIETTE TEMPTS NEKHLUDOFF.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the Senate, Nekhludoff and the advocate walked on\r\ntogether, the advocate having given the driver of his carriage orders\r\nto follow them. The advocate told Nekhludoff the story of the chief of a\r\nGovernment department, about whom the Senators had been talking: how the\r\nthing was found out, and how the man, who according to law should\r\nhave been sent to the mines, had been appointed Governor of a town\r\nin Siberia. Then he related with particular pleasure how several\r\nhigh-placed persons stole a lot of money collected for the erection of\r\nthe still unfinished monument which they had passed that morning; also,\r\nhow the mistress of So-and-so got a lot of money at the Stock Exchange,\r\nand how So-and-so agreed with So-and-so to sell him his wife. The\r\nadvocate began another story about a swindle, and all sorts of crimes\r\ncommitted by persons in high places, who, instead of being in prison,\r\nsat on presidential chairs in all sorts of Government institutions.\r\nThese tales, of which the advocate seemed to have an unending supply,\r\ngave him much pleasure, showing as they did, with perfect clearness,\r\nthat his means of getting money were quite just and innocent compared\r\nto the means which the highest officials in Petersburg made use of.\r\nThe advocate was therefore surprised when Nekhludoff took an isvostchik\r\nbefore hearing the end of the story, said good-bye, and left him.\r\nNekhludoff felt very sad. It was chiefly the rejection of the appeal by\r\nthe Senate, confirming the senseless torments that the innocent Maslova\r\nwas enduring, that saddened him, and also the fact that this rejection\r\nmade it still harder for him to unite his fate with hers. The stories\r\nabout existing evils, which the advocate recounted with such relish,\r\nheightened his sadness, and so did the cold, unkind look that the\r\nonce sweet-natured, frank, noble Selenin had given him, and which kept\r\nrecurring to his mind.\r\n\r\nOn his return the doorkeeper handed him a note, and said, rather\r\nscornfully, that some kind of woman had written it in the hall. It was\r\na note from Shoustova\'s mother. She wrote that she had come to thank\r\nher daughter\'s benefactor and saviour, and to implore him to come to see\r\nthem on the Vasilievsky, 5th Line, house No. --. This was very necessary\r\nbecause of Vera Doukhova. He need not be afraid that they would weary\r\nhim with expressions of gratitude. They would not speak their gratitude,\r\nbut be simply glad to see him. Would he not come next morning, if he\r\ncould?\r\n\r\nThere was another note from Bogotyreff, a former fellow-officer,\r\naide-de-camp to the Emperor, whom Nekhludoff had asked to hand\r\npersonally to the Emperor his petition on behalf of the sectarians.\r\nBogotyreff wrote, in his large, firm hand, that he would put the\r\npetition into the Emperor\'s own hands, as he had promised; but that it\r\nhad occurred to him that it might be better for Nekhludoff first to go\r\nand see the person on whom the matter depended.\r\n\r\nAfter the impressions received during the last few days, Nekhludoff felt\r\nperfectly hopeless of getting anything done. The plans he had formed\r\nin Moscow seemed now something like the dreams of youth, which are\r\ninevitably followed by disillusion when life comes to be faced. Still,\r\nbeing now in Petersburg, he considered it his duty to do all he had\r\nintended, and he resolved next day, after consulting Bogotyreff, to\r\nact on his advice and see the person on whom the case of the sectarians\r\ndepended.\r\n\r\nHe got out the sectarians\' petition from his portfolio, and began\r\nreading it over, when there was a knock at his door, and a footman came\r\nin with a message from the Countess Katerina Ivanovna, who asked him to\r\ncome up and have a cup of tea with her.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff said he would come at once, and having put the papers back\r\ninto the portfolio, he went up to his aunt\'s. He looked out of a window\r\non his way, and saw Mariette\'s pair of bays standing in front of the\r\nhouse, and he suddenly brightened and felt inclined to smile.\r\n\r\nMariette, with a hat on her head, not in black but with a light dress\r\nof many shades, sat with a cup in her hand beside the Countess\'s easy\r\nchair, prattling about something while her beautiful, laughing\r\neyes glistened. She had said something funny--something indecently\r\nfunny--just as Nekhludoff entered the room. He knew it by the way she\r\nlaughed, and by the way the good-natured Countess Katerina Ivanovna\'s\r\nfat body was shaking with laughter; while Mariette, her smiling mouth\r\nslightly drawn to one side, her head a little bent, a peculiarly\r\nmischievous expression in her merry, energetic face, sat silently\r\nlooking at her companion. From a few words which he overheard,\r\nNekhludoff guessed that they were talking of the second piece of\r\nPetersburg news, the episode of the Siberian Governor, and that it was\r\nin reference to this subject that Mariette had said something so funny\r\nthat the Countess could not control herself for a long time.\r\n\r\n"You will kill me," she said, coughing.\r\n\r\nAfter saying "How d\'you do?" Nekhludoff sat down. He was about to\r\ncensure Mariette in his mind for her levity when, noticing the serious\r\nand even slightly dissatisfied look in his eyes, she suddenly, to please\r\nhim, changed not only the expression of her face, but also the attitude\r\nof her mind; for she felt the wish to please him as soon as she looked\r\nat him. She suddenly turned serious, dissatisfied with her life, as if\r\nseeking and striving after something; it was not that she pretended, but\r\nshe really reproduced in herself the very same state of mind that he was\r\nin, although it would have been impossible for her to express in words\r\nwhat was the state of Nekhludoff\'s mind at that moment.\r\n\r\nShe asked him how he had accomplished his tasks. He told her about his\r\nfailure in the Senate and his meeting Selenin.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a pure soul! He is, indeed, a chevalier sans peur et sans\r\nreproche. A pure soul!" said both ladies, using the epithet commonly\r\napplied to Selenin in Petersburg society.\r\n\r\n"What is his wife like?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"His wife? Well, I do not wish to judge, but she does not understand\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible that he, too, was for rejecting the appeal?" Mariette\r\nasked with real sympathy. "It is dreadful. How sorry I am for her," she\r\nadded with a sigh.\r\n\r\nHe frowned, and in order to change the subject began to speak about\r\nShoustova, who had been imprisoned in the fortress and was now set free\r\nthrough the influence of Mariette\'s husband. He thanked her for her\r\ntrouble, and was going on to say how dreadful he thought it, that this\r\nwoman and the whole of her family had suffered merely, because no one\r\nhad reminded the authorities about them, but Mariette interrupted him\r\nand expressed her own indignation.\r\n\r\n"Say nothing about it to me," she said. "When my husband told me she\r\ncould be set free, it was this that struck me, \'What was she kept in\r\nprison for if she is innocent?\'" She went on expressing what Nekhludoff\r\nwas about to say.\r\n\r\n"It is revolting--revolting."\r\n\r\nCountess Katerina Ivanovna noticed that Mariette was coquetting with her\r\nnephew, and this amused her. "What do you think?" she said, when they\r\nwere silent. "Supposing you come to Aline\'s to-morrow night. Kiesewetter\r\nwill be there. And you, too," she said, turning to Mariette. "_Il vous a\r\nremarque_," she went on to her nephew. "He told me that what you say (I\r\nrepeated it all to him) is a very good sign, and that you will certainly\r\ncome to Christ. You must come absolutely. Tell him to, Mariette, and\r\ncome yourself."\r\n\r\n"Countess, in the first place, I have no right whatever to give any kind\r\nof advice to the Prince," said Mariette, and gave Nekhludoff a look that\r\nsomehow established a full comprehension between them of their attitude\r\nin relation to the Countess\'s words and evangelicalism in general.\r\n"Secondly, I do not much care, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know you always do things the wrong way round, and according to\r\nyour own ideas."\r\n\r\n"My own ideas? I have faith like the most simple peasant woman," said\r\nMariette with a smile. "And, thirdly, I am going to the French Theatre\r\nto-morrow night."\r\n\r\n"Ah! And have you seen that--What\'s her name?" asked Countess Katerina\r\nIvanovna. Mariette gave the name of a celebrated French actress.\r\n\r\n"You must go, most decidedly; she is wonderful."\r\n\r\n"Whom am I to see first, ma tante--the actress or the preacher?"\r\nNekhludoff said with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Please don\'t catch at my words."\r\n\r\n"I should think the preacher first and then the actress, or else the\r\ndesire for the sermon might vanish altogether," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No; better begin with the French Theatre, and do penance afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Now, then, you are not to hold me up for ridicule. The preacher is the\r\npreacher and the theatre is the theatre. One need not weep in order to\r\nbe saved. One must have faith, and then one is sure to be gay."\r\n\r\n"You, ma tante, preach better than any preacher."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what?" said Mariette. "Come into my box to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I shall not be able to."\r\n\r\nThe footman interrupted the conversation by announcing a visitor. It\r\nwas the secretary of a philanthropic society of which the Countess was\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that is the dullest of men. I think I shall receive him out there,\r\nand return to you later on. Mariette, give him his tea," said the\r\nCountess, and left the room, with her quick, wriggling walk.\r\n\r\nMariette took the glove off her firm, rather flat hand, the fourth\r\nfinger of which was covered with rings.\r\n\r\n"Want any?" she said, taking hold of the silver teapot, under which a\r\nspirit lamp was burning, and extending her little finger curiously. Her\r\nface looked sad and serious.\r\n\r\n"It is always terribly painful to me to notice that people whose opinion\r\nI value confound me with the position I am placed in." She seemed ready\r\nto cry as she said these last words. And though these words had no\r\nmeaning, or at any rate a very indefinite meaning, they seemed to be of\r\nexceptional depth, meaning, or goodness to Nekhludoff, so much was he\r\nattracted by the look of the bright eyes which accompanied the words of\r\nthis young, beautiful, and well-dressed woman.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked at her in silence, and could not take his eyes from\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"You think I do not understand you and all that goes on in you. Why,\r\neverybody knows what you are doing. _C\'est le secret de polichinelle_.\r\nAnd I am delighted with your work, and think highly of you."\r\n\r\n"Really, there is nothing to be delighted with; and I have done so\r\nlittle as Yet."\r\n\r\n"No matter. I understand your feelings, and I understand her. All\r\nright, all right. I will say nothing more about it," she said, noticing\r\ndispleasure on his face. "But I also understand that after seeing all\r\nthe suffering and the horror in the prisons," Mariette went on, her only\r\ndesire that of attracting him, and guessing with her woman\'s instinct\r\nwhat was dear and important to him, "you wish to help the sufferers,\r\nthose who are made to suffer so terribly by other men, and their cruelty\r\nand indifference. I understand the willingness to give one\'s life, and\r\ncould give mine in such a cause, but we each have our own fate."\r\n\r\n"Are you, then, dissatisfied with your fate?"\r\n\r\n"I?" she asked, as if struck with surprise that such a question could\r\nbe put to her. "I have to be satisfied, and am satisfied. But there is a\r\nworm that wakes up--"\r\n\r\n"And he must not be allowed to fall asleep again. It is a voice that\r\nmust be obeyed," Nekhludoff said, falling into the trap.\r\n\r\nMany a time later on Nekhludoff remembered with shame his talk with her.\r\nHe remembered her words, which were not so much lies as imitations of\r\nhis own, and her face, which seemed looking at him with sympathetic\r\nattention when he told her about the terrors of the prison and of his\r\nimpressions in the country.\r\n\r\nWhen the Countess returned they were talking not merely like old, but\r\nlike exclusive friends who alone understood one another. They were\r\ntalking about the injustice of power, of the sufferings of the\r\nunfortunate, the poverty of the people, yet in reality in the midst of\r\nthe sound of their talk their eyes, gazing at each other, kept asking,\r\n"Can you love me?" and answering, "I can," and the sex-feeling, taking\r\nthe most unexpected and brightest forms, drew them to each other. As she\r\nwas going away she told him that she would always be willing to serve\r\nhim in any way she could, and asked him to come and see her, if only for\r\na moment, in the theatre next day, as she had a very important thing to\r\ntell him about.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and when shall I see you again?" she added, with a sigh, carefully\r\ndrawing the glove over her jewelled hand.\r\n\r\n"Say you will come."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff promised.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Nekhludoff was alone in his room, and lay down after\r\nputting out his candle, he could not sleep. He thought of Maslova, of\r\nthe decision of the Senate, of his resolve to follow her in any case, of\r\nhis having given up the land. The face of Mariette appeared to him as if\r\nin answer to those thoughts--her look, her sigh, her words, "When shall\r\nI see you again?" and her smile seemed vivid as if he really saw her,\r\nand he also smiled. "Shall I be doing right in going to Siberia? And\r\nhave I done right in divesting myself of my wealth?" And the answers to\r\nthe questions on this Petersburg night, on which the daylight streamed\r\ninto the window from under the blind, were quite indefinite. All seemed\r\nmixed in his head. He recalled his former state of mind, and the former\r\nsequence of his thoughts, but they had no longer their former power or\r\nvalidity.\r\n\r\n"And supposing I have invented all this, and am unable to live it\r\nthrough--supposing I repent of having acted right," he thought; and\r\nunable to answer he was seized with such anguish and despair as he had\r\nlong not felt. Unable to free himself from his perplexity, he fell into\r\na heavy sleep, such as he had slept after a heavy loss at cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nLYDIA SHOUSTOVA\'S HOME.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff awoke next morning feeling as if he had been guilty of some\r\niniquity the day before. He began considering. He could not remember\r\nhaving done anything wrong; he had committed no evil act, but he had had\r\nevil thoughts. He had thought that all his present resolutions to marry\r\nKatusha and to give up his land were unachievable dreams; that he should\r\nbe unable to bear it; that it was artificial, unnatural; and that he\r\nwould have to go on living as he lived.\r\n\r\nHe had committed no evil action, but, what was far worse than an\r\nevil action, he had entertained evil thoughts whence all evil actions\r\nproceed. An evil action may not be repeated, and can be repented of; but\r\nevil thoughts generate all evil actions.\r\n\r\nAn evil action only smooths the path for other evil acts; evil thoughts\r\nuncontrollably drag one along that path.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff repeated in his mind the thoughts of the day before, he\r\nwas surprised that he could for a moment have believed these thoughts.\r\nHowever new and difficult that which he had decided to do might be, he\r\nknew that it was the only possible way of life for him now, and however\r\neasy and natural it might have been to return to his former state, he\r\nknew that state to be death.\r\n\r\nYesterday\'s temptation seemed like the feeling when one awakes from deep\r\nsleep, and, without feeling sleepy, wants to lie comfortably in bed a\r\nlittle longer, yet knows that it is time to rise and commence the glad\r\nand important work that awaits one.\r\n\r\nOn that, his last day in Petersburg, he went in the morning to the\r\nVasilievski Ostrov to see Shoustova. Shoustova lived on the second\r\nfloor, and having been shown the back stairs, Nekhludoff entered\r\nstraight into the hot kitchen, which smelt strongly of food. An elderly\r\nwoman, with turned-up sleeves, with an apron and spectacles, stood by\r\nthe fire stirring something in a steaming pan.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you want?" she asked severely, looking at him over her\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\nBefore Nekhludoff had time to answer, an expression of fright and joy\r\nappeared on her face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Prince!" she exclaimed, wiping her hands on her apron. "But why\r\nhave you come the back way? Our Benefactor! I am her mother. They have\r\nnearly killed my little girl. You have saved us," she said, catching\r\nhold of Nekhludoff\'s hand and trying to kiss it.\r\n\r\n"I went to see you yesterday. My sister asked me to. She is here. This\r\nway, this way, please," said Shoustova\'s mother, as she led the way\r\nthrough a narrow door, and a dark passage, arranging her hair and\r\npulling at her tucked-up skirt. "My sister\'s name is Kornilova. You must\r\nhave heard of her," she added, stopping before a closed door. "She was\r\nmixed up in a political affair. An extremely clever woman!"\r\n\r\nShoustova\'s mother opened the door and showed Nekhludoff into a little\r\nroom where on a sofa with a table before it sat a plump, short girl with\r\nfair hair that curled round her pale, round face, which was very like\r\nher mother\'s. She had a striped cotton blouse on.\r\n\r\nOpposite her, in an armchair, leaning forward, so that he was nearly\r\nbent double, sat a young fellow with a slight, black beard and\r\nmoustaches.\r\n\r\n"Lydia, Prince Nekhludoff!" he said.\r\n\r\nThe pale girl jumped up, nervously pushing back a lock of hair behind\r\nher ear, and gazing at the newcomer with a frightened look in her large,\r\ngrey eyes.\r\n\r\n"So you are that dangerous woman whom Vera Doukhova wished me to\r\nintercede for?" Nekhludoff asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am," said Lydia Shoustova, her broad, kind, child-like smile\r\ndisclosing a row of beautiful teeth. "It was aunt who was so anxious to\r\nsee you. Aunt!" she called out, in a pleasant, tender voice through a\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Your imprisonment grieved Vera Doukhova very much," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Take a seat here, or better here," said Shoustova, pointing to the\r\nbattered easy-chair from which the young man had just risen.\r\n\r\n"My cousin, Zakharov," she said, noticing that Nekhludoff looked at the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nThe young man greeted the visitor with a smile as kindly as Shoustova\'s,\r\nand when Nekhludoff sat down he brought himself another chair, and sat\r\nby his side. A fair-haired schoolboy of about 10 also came into the room\r\nand silently sat down on the window-sill.\r\n\r\n"Vera Doukhova is a great friend of my aunt\'s, but I hardly know her,"\r\nsaid Shoustova.\r\n\r\nThen a woman with a very pleasant face, with a white blouse and leather\r\nbelt, came in from the next room.\r\n\r\n"How do you do? Thanks for coming," she began as soon as she had taken\r\nthe place next Shoustova\'s on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Well, and how is Vera. You have seen her? How does she bear her fate?"\r\n\r\n"She does not complain," said Nekhludoff. "She says she feels perfectly\r\nhappy."\'\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s like Vera. I know her," said the aunt, smiling and shaking\r\nher head. "One must know her. She has a fine character. Everything for\r\nothers; nothing for herself."\r\n\r\n"No, she asked nothing for herself, but only seemed concerned about your\r\nniece. What seemed to trouble her most was, as she said, that your niece\r\nwas imprisoned for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s true," said the aunt. "It is a dreadful business. She\r\nsuffered, in reality, because of me."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, aunt. I should have taken the papers without you all the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\n"Allow me to know better," said the aunt. "You see," she went on to\r\nNekhludoff, "it all happened because a certain person asked me to keep\r\nhis papers for a time, and I, having no house at the time, brought them\r\nto her. And that very night the police searched her room and took her\r\nand the papers, and have kept her up to now, demanding that she should\r\nsay from whom she had them."\r\n\r\n"But I never told them," said Shoustova quickly, pulling nervously at a\r\nlock that was not even out of place.\r\n\r\n"I never said you did," answered the aunt.\r\n\r\n"If they took Mitin up it was certainly not through me," said Shoustova,\r\nblushing, and looking round uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak about it, Lydia dear," said her mother.\r\n\r\n"Why not? I should like to relate it," said Shoustova, no longer smiling\r\nnor pulling her lock, but twisting it round her finger and getting\r\nredder.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget what happened yesterday when you began talking about it."\r\n\r\n"Not at all---Leave me alone, mamma. I did not tell, I only kept quiet.\r\nWhen he examined me about Mitin and about aunt, I said nothing, and told\r\nhim I would not answer."\r\n\r\n"Then this--Petrov--"\r\n\r\n"Petrov is a spy, a gendarme, and a blackguard," put in the aunt, to\r\nexplain her niece\'s words to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Then he began persuading," continued Shoustova, excitedly and\r\nhurriedly. "\'Anything you tell me,\' he said, \'can harm no one; on the\r\ncontrary, if you tell me, we may be able to set free innocent people\r\nwhom we may be uselessly tormenting.\' Well, I still said I would not\r\ntell. Then he said, \'All right, don\'t tell, but do not deny what I am\r\ngoing to say.\' And he named Mitin."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about it," said the aunt.\r\n\r\n"Oh, aunt, don\'t interrupt," and she went on pulling the lock of hair\r\nand looking round. "And then, only fancy, the next day I hear--they let\r\nme know by knocking at the wall--that Mitin is arrested. Well, I think\r\nI have betrayed him, and this tormented me so--it tormented me so that I\r\nnearly went mad."\r\n\r\n"And it turned out that it was not at all because of you he was taken\r\nup?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I didn\'t know. I think, \'There, now, I have betrayed him.\' I\r\nwalk and walk up and down from wall to wall, and cannot help thinking.\r\nI think, \'I have betrayed him.\' I lie down and cover myself up, and hear\r\nsomething whispering, \'Betrayed! betrayed Mitin! Mitin betrayed!\' I\r\nknow it is an hallucination, but cannot help listening. I wish to\r\nfall asleep, I cannot. I wish not to think, and cannot cease. That is\r\nterrible!" and as Shoustova spoke she got more and more excited, and\r\ntwisted and untwisted the lock of hair round her finger.\r\n\r\n"Lydia, dear, be calm," the mother said, touching her shoulder.\r\n\r\nBut Shoustova could not stop herself.\r\n\r\n"It is all the more terrible--" she began again, but did not finish, and\r\njumping up with a cry rushed out of the room.\r\n\r\nHer mother turned to follow her.\r\n\r\n"They ought to be hanged, the rascals!" said the schoolboy who was\r\nsitting on the window-sill.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" said the mother.\r\n\r\n"I only said--Oh, it\'s nothing," the schoolboy answered, and taking a\r\ncigarette that lay on the table, he began to smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLYDIA\'S AUNT.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that solitary confinement is terrible for the young," said the\r\naunt, shaking her head and also lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"I should say for every one," Nekhludoff replied.\r\n\r\n"No, not for all," answered the aunt. "For the real revolutionists, I\r\nhave been told, it is rest and quiet. A man who is wanted by the police\r\nlives in continual anxiety, material want, and fear for himself and\r\nothers, and for his cause, and at last, when he is taken up and it is\r\nall over, and all responsibility is off his shoulders, he can sit and\r\nrest. I have been told they actually feel joyful when taken up. But the\r\nyoung and innocent (they always first arrest the innocent, like Lydia),\r\nfor them the first shock is terrible. It is not that they deprive you of\r\nfreedom; and the bad food and bad air--all that is nothing. Three times\r\nas many privations would be easily borne if it were not for the moral\r\nshock when one is first taken."\r\n\r\n"Have you experienced it?"\r\n\r\n"I? I was twice in prison," she answered, with a sad, gentle smile.\r\n"When I was arrested for the first time I had done nothing. I was 22,\r\nhad a child, and was expecting another. Though the loss of freedom and\r\nthe parting with my child and husband were hard, they were nothing when\r\ncompared with what I felt when I found out that I had ceased being a\r\nhuman creature and had become a thing. I wished to say good-bye to my\r\nlittle daughter. I was told to go and get into the trap. I asked where I\r\nwas being taken to. The answer was that I should know when I got there.\r\nI asked what I was accused of, but got no reply. After I had been\r\nexamined, and after they had undressed me and put numbered prison\r\nclothes on me, they led me to a vault, opened a door, pushed me in, and\r\nleft me alone; a sentinel, with a loaded gun, paced up and down in front\r\nof my door, and every now and then looked in through a crack--I felt\r\nterribly depressed. What struck me most at the time was that the\r\ngendarme officer who examined me offered me a cigarette. So he knew that\r\npeople liked smoking, and must know that they liked freedom and light;\r\nand that mothers love their children, and children their mothers. Then\r\nhow could they tear me pitilessly from all that was dear to me, and\r\nlock me up in prison like a wild animal? That sort of thing could not\r\nbe borne without evil effects. Any one who believes in God and men, and\r\nbelieves that men love one another, will cease to believe it after all\r\nthat. I have ceased to believe in humanity since then, and have grown\r\nembittered," she finished, with a smile.\r\n\r\nShoustova\'s mother came in at the door through which her daughter had\r\ngone out, and said that Lydia was very much upset, and would not come in\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"And what has this young life been ruined for?" said the aunt. "What is\r\nespecially painful to me is that I am the involuntary cause of it."\r\n\r\n"She will recover in the country, with God\'s help," said the mother. "We\r\nshall send her to her father."\r\n\r\n"Yes, if it were not for you she would have perished altogether," said\r\nthe aunt. "Thank you. But what I wished to see you for is this: I wished\r\nto ask you to take a letter to Vera Doukhova," and she got the letter\r\nout of her pocket.\r\n\r\n"The letter is not closed; you may read and tear it up, or hand it to\r\nher, according to how far it coincides with your principles," she said.\r\n"It contains nothing compromising."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff took the letter, and, having promised to give it to Vera\r\nDoukhova, he took his leave and went away. He sealed the letter without\r\nreading it, meaning to take it to its destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE CHURCH AND THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that kept Nekhludoff in Petersburg was the case of the\r\nsectarians, whose petition he intended to get his former fellow-officer,\r\nAide-de-camp Bogatyreff, to hand to the Tsar. He came to Bogatyreff in\r\nthe morning, and found him about to go out, though still at breakfast.\r\nBogatyreff was not tall, but firmly built and wonderfully strong (he\r\ncould bend a horseshoe), a kind, honest, straight, and even liberal man.\r\nIn spite of these qualities, he was intimate at Court, and very fond of\r\nthe Tsar and his family, and by some strange method he managed, while\r\nliving in that highest circle, to see nothing but the good in it and to\r\ntake no part in the evil and corruption. He never condemned anybody\r\nnor any measure, and either kept silent or spoke in a bold, loud voice,\r\nalmost shouting what he had to say, and often laughing in the same\r\nboisterous manner. And he did not do it for diplomatic reasons, but\r\nbecause such was his character.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s right that you have come. Would you like some breakfast?\r\nSit down, the beefsteaks are fine! I always begin with something\r\nsubstantial--begin and finish, too. Ha! ha! ha! Well, then, have a glass\r\nof wine," he shouted, pointing to a decanter of claret. "I have been\r\nthinking of you. I will hand on the petition. I shall put it into his\r\nown hands. You may count on that, only it occurred to me that it would\r\nbe best for you to call on Toporoff."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff made a wry face at the mention of Toporoff.\r\n\r\n"It all depends on him. He will be consulted, anyhow. And perhaps he may\r\nhimself meet your wishes."\r\n\r\n"If you advise it I shall go."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. Well, and how does Petersburg agree with you?" shouted\r\nBogatyreff. "Tell me. Eh?"\r\n\r\n"I feel myself getting hypnotised," replied Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Hypnotised!" Bogatyreff repeated, and burst out laughing. "You won\'t\r\nhave anything? Well, just as you please," and he wiped his moustaches\r\nwith his napkin. "Then you\'ll go? Eh? If he does not do it, give the\r\npetition to me, and I shall hand it on to-morrow." Shouting these words,\r\nhe rose, crossed himself just as naturally as he had wiped his mouth,\r\nand began buckling on his sword.\r\n\r\n"And now good-bye; I must go. We are both going out," said Nekhludoff,\r\nand shaking Bogatyreff\'s strong, broad hand, and with the sense of\r\npleasure which the impression of something healthy and unconsciously\r\nfresh always gave him, Nekhludoff parted from Bogatyreff on the\r\ndoor-steps.\r\n\r\nThough he expected no good result from his visit, still Nekhludoff,\r\nfollowing Bogatyreff\'s advice, went to see Toporoff, on whom the\r\nsectarians\' fate depended.\r\n\r\nThe position occupied by Toporoff, involving as it did an incongruity of\r\npurpose, could only be held by a dull man devoid of moral sensibility.\r\nToporoff possessed both these negative qualities. The incongruity of the\r\nposition he occupied was this. It was his duty to keep up and to defend,\r\nby external measures, not excluding violence, that Church which, by its\r\nown declaration, was established by God Himself and could not be shaken\r\nby the gates of hell nor by anything human. This divine and immutable\r\nGod-established institution had to be sustained and defended by a human\r\ninstitution--the Holy Synod, managed by Toporoff and his officials.\r\nToporoff did not see this contradiction, nor did he wish to see it, and\r\nhe was therefore much concerned lest some Romish priest, some pastor, or\r\nsome sectarian should destroy that Church which the gates of hell could\r\nnot conquer.\r\n\r\nToporoff, like all those who are quite destitute of the fundamental\r\nreligious feeling that recognises the equality and brotherhood of men,\r\nwas fully convinced that the common people were creatures entirely\r\ndifferent from himself, and that the people needed what he could very\r\nwell do without, for at the bottom of his heart he believed in nothing,\r\nand found such a state very convenient and pleasant. Yet he feared lest\r\nthe people might also come to such a state, and looked upon it as his\r\nsacred duty, as he called it, to save the people therefrom.\r\n\r\nA certain cookery book declares that some crabs like to be boiled alive.\r\nIn the same way he thought and spoke as if the people liked being kept\r\nin superstition; only he meant this in a literal sense, whereas the\r\ncookery book did not mean its words literally.\r\n\r\nHis feelings towards the religion he was keeping up were the same as\r\nthose of the poultry-keeper towards the carrion he fed his fowls on.\r\nCarrion was very disgusting, but the fowls liked it; therefore it was\r\nright to feed the fowls on carrion. Of course all this worship of the\r\nimages of the Iberian, Kasan and Smolensk Mothers of God was a gross\r\nsuperstition, but the people liked it and believed in it, and therefore\r\nthe superstition must be kept up.\r\n\r\nThus thought Toporoff, not considering that the people only liked\r\nsuperstition because there always have been, and still are, men like\r\nhimself who, being enlightened, instead of using their light to help\r\nothers to struggle out of their dark ignorance, use it to plunge them\r\nstill deeper into it.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff entered the reception-room Toporoff was in his study\r\ntalking with an abbess, a lively and aristocratic lady, who was\r\nspreading the Greek orthodox faith in Western Russia among the Uniates\r\n(who acknowledge the Pope of Rome), and who have the Greek religion\r\nenforced on them. An official who was in the reception-room inquired\r\nwhat Nekhludoff wanted, and when he heard that Nekhludoff meant to\r\nhand in a petition to the Emperor, he asked him if he would allow the\r\npetition to be read first. Nekhludoff gave it him, and the official took\r\nit into the study. The abbess, with her hood and flowing veil and her\r\nlong train trailing behind, left the study and went out, her white hands\r\n(with their well-tended nails) holding a topaz rosary. Nekhludoff was\r\nnot immediately asked to come in. Toporoff was reading the petition\r\nand shaking his head. He was unpleasantly surprised by the clear and\r\nemphatic wording of it.\r\n\r\n"If it gets into the hands of the Emperor it may cause\r\nmisunderstandings, and unpleasant questions may be asked," he thought\r\nas he read. Then he put the petition on the table, rang, and ordered\r\nNekhludoff to be asked in.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the case of the sectarians; he had had a petition from\r\nthem before. The case was this: These Christians, fallen away from the\r\nGreek Orthodox Church, were first exhorted and then tried by law, but\r\nwere acquitted. Then the Archdeacon and the Governor arranged, on the\r\nplea that their marriages were illegal, to exile these sectarians,\r\nseparating the husbands, wives, and children. These fathers and\r\nwives were now petitioning that they should not be parted. Toporoff\r\nrecollected the first time the case came to his notice: he had at that\r\ntime hesitated whether he had not better put a stop to it. But then\r\nhe thought no harm could result from his confirming the decision to\r\nseparate and exile the different members of the sectarian families,\r\nwhereas allowing the peasant sect to remain where it was might have a\r\nbad effect on the rest of the inhabitants of the place and cause them\r\nto fall away from Orthodoxy. And then the affair also proved the zeal\r\nof the Archdeacon, and so he let the case proceed along the lines it had\r\ntaken. But now that they had a defender such as Nekhludoff, who had some\r\ninfluence in Petersburg, the case might be specially pointed out to the\r\nEmperor as something cruel, or it might get into the foreign papers.\r\nTherefore he at once took an unexpected decision.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" he said, with the air of a very busy man, receiving\r\nNekhludoff standing, and at once starting on the business. "I know\r\nthis case. As soon as I saw the names I recollected this unfortunate\r\nbusiness," he said, taking up the petition and showing it to Nekhludoff.\r\n"And I am much indebted to you for reminding me of it. It is the\r\nover-zealousness of the provincial authorities."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stood silent, looking with no kindly feelings at the\r\nimmovable, pale mask of a face before him.\r\n\r\n"And I shall give orders that these measures should be revoked and the\r\npeople reinstated in their homes."\r\n\r\n"So that I need not make use of this petition?"\r\n\r\n"I promise you most assuredly," answered Toporoff, laying a stress on\r\nthe word I, as if quite convinced that his honesty, his word was the\r\nbest guarantee. "It will be best if I write at once. Take a seat,\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nHe went up to the table and began to write. As Nekhludoff sat down he\r\nlooked at the narrow, bald skull, at the fat, blue-veined hand that was\r\nswiftly guiding the pen, and wondered why this evidently indifferent man\r\nwas doing what he did and why he was doing it with such care.\r\n\r\n"Well, here you are," said Toporoff, sealing the envelope; "you may let\r\nyour clients know," and he stretched his lips to imitate a smile.\r\n\r\n"Then what did these people suffer for?" Nekhludoff asked, as he took\r\nthe envelope.\r\n\r\nToporoff raised his head and smiled, as if Nekhludoff\'s question gave\r\nhim pleasure. "That I cannot tell. All I can say is that the interests\r\nof the people guarded by us are so important that too great a zeal\r\nin matters of religion is not so dangerous or so harmful as the\r\nindifference which is now spreading--"\r\n\r\n"But how is it that in the name of religion the very first demands of\r\nrighteousness are violated--families are separated?"\r\n\r\nToporoff continued to smile patronisingly, evidently thinking what\r\nNekhludoff said very pretty. Anything that Nekhludoff could say he would\r\nhave considered very pretty and very one-sided, from the height of what\r\nhe considered his far-reaching office in the State.\r\n\r\n"It may seem so from the point of view of a private individual," he\r\nsaid, "but from an administrative point of view it appears in a rather\r\ndifferent light. However, I must bid you good-bye, now," said Toporoff,\r\nbowing his head and holding out his hand, which Nekhludoff pressed.\r\n\r\n"The interests of the people! Your interests is what you mean!" thought\r\nNekhludoff as he went out. And he ran over in his mind the people in\r\nwhom is manifested the activity of the institutions that uphold religion\r\nand educate the people. He began with the woman punished for the\r\nillicit sale of spirits, the boy for theft, the tramp for tramping, the\r\nincendiary for setting a house on fire, the banker for fraud, and that\r\nunfortunate Lydia Shoustova imprisoned only because they hoped to get\r\nsuch information as they required from her. Then he thought of the\r\nsectarians punished for violating Orthodoxy, and Gourkevitch for wanting\r\nconstitutional government, and Nekhludoff clearly saw that all these\r\npeople were arrested, locked up, exiled, not really because they\r\ntransgressed against justice or behaved unlawfully, but only because\r\nthey were an obstacle hindering the officials and the rich from enjoying\r\nthe property they had taken away from the people. And the woman who sold\r\nwine without having a license, and the thief knocking about the town,\r\nand Lydia Shoustova hiding proclamations, and the sectarians upsetting\r\nsuperstitions, and Gourkevitch desiring a constitution, were a real\r\nhindrance. It seemed perfectly clear to Nekhludoff that all these\r\nofficials, beginning with his aunt\'s husband, the Senators, and\r\nToporoff, down to those clean and correct gentlemen who sat at the\r\ntables in the Ministry Office, were not at all troubled by the fact that\r\nthat in such a state of things the innocent had to suffer, but were only\r\nconcerned how to get rid of the really dangerous, so that the rule\r\nthat ten guilty should escape rather than that one innocent should\r\nbe condemned was not observed, but, on the contrary, for the sake of\r\ngetting rid of one really dangerous person, ten who seemed dangerous\r\nwere punished, as, when cutting a rotten piece out of anything, one has\r\nto cut away some that is good.\r\n\r\nThis explanation seemed very simple and clear to Nekhludoff; but its\r\nvery simplicity and clearness made him hesitate to accept it. Was it\r\npossible that so complicated a phenomenon could have so simple and\r\nterrible an explanation? Was it possible that all these words about\r\njustice, law, religion, and God, and so on, were mere words, hiding the\r\ncoarsest cupidity and cruelty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING OF MARIETTE\'S ATTRACTION.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff would have left Petersburg on the evening of the same day,\r\nbut he had promised Mariette to meet her at the theatre, and though he\r\nknew that he ought not to keep that promise, he deceived himself into\r\nthe belief that it would not be right to break his word.\r\n\r\n"Am I capable of withstanding these temptations?" he asked himself not\r\nquite honestly. "I shall try for the last time."\r\n\r\nHe dressed in his evening clothes, and arrived at the theatre during the\r\nsecond act of the eternal Dame aux Camelias, in which a foreign actress\r\nonce again, and in a novel manner, showed how women die of consumption.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was quite full. Mariette\'s box was at once, and with great\r\ndeference, shown to Nekhludoff at his request. A liveried servant stood\r\nin the corridor outside; he bowed to Nekhludoff as to one whom he knew,\r\nand opened the door of the box.\r\n\r\nAll the people who sat and stood in the boxes on the opposite side,\r\nthose who sat near and those who were in the parterre, with their grey,\r\ngrizzly, bald, or curly heads--all were absorbed in watching the thin,\r\nbony actress who, dressed in silks and laces, was wriggling before them,\r\nand speaking in an unnatural voice.\r\n\r\nSome one called "Hush!" when the door opened, and two streams, one of\r\ncool, the other of hot, air touched Nekhludoff\'s face.\r\n\r\nMariette and a lady whom he did not know, with a red cape and a big,\r\nheavy head-dress, were in the box, and two men also, Mariette\'s\r\nhusband, the General, a tall, handsome man with a severe, inscrutable\r\ncountenance, a Roman nose, and a uniform padded round the chest, and a\r\nfair man, with a bit of shaved chin between pompous whiskers.\r\n\r\nMariette, graceful, slight, elegant, her low-necked dress showing her\r\nfirm, shapely, slanting shoulders, with a little black mole where they\r\njoined her neck, immediately turned, and pointed with her face to a\r\nchair behind her in an engaging manner, and smiled a smile that seemed\r\nfull of meaning to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nThe husband looked at him in the quiet way in which he did everything,\r\nand bowed. In the look he exchanged with his wife, the master, the owner\r\nof a beautiful woman, was to be seen at once.\r\n\r\nWhen the monologue was over the theatre resounded with the clapping of\r\nhands. Mariette rose, and holding up her rustling silk skirt, went into\r\nthe back of the box and introduced Nekhludoff to her husband.\r\n\r\nThe General, without ceasing to smile with his eyes, said he was very\r\npleased, and then sat inscrutably silent.\r\n\r\n"I ought to have left to-day, had I not promised," said Nekhludoff to\r\nMariette.\r\n\r\n"If you do not care to see me," said Mariette, in answer to what his\r\nwords implied, "you will see a wonderful actress. Was she not splendid\r\nin the last scene?" she asked, turning to her husband.\r\n\r\nThe husband bowed his head.\r\n\r\n"This sort of thing does not touch me," said Nekhludoff. "I have seen so\r\nmuch real suffering lately that--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sit down and tell me."\r\n\r\nThe husband listened, his eyes smiling more and more ironically. "I have\r\nbeen to see that woman whom they have set free, and who has been kept in\r\nprison for so long; she is quite broken down."\r\n\r\n"That is the woman I spoke to you about," Mariette said to her husband.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I was very pleased that she could be set free," said the\r\nhusband quietly, nodding and smiling under his moustache with evident\r\nirony, so it seemed to Nekhludoff. "I shall go and have a smoke."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat waiting to hear what the something was that Mariette had\r\nto tell him. She said nothing, and did not even try to say anything, but\r\njoked and spoke about the performance, which she thought ought to touch\r\nNekhludoff. Nekhludoff saw that she had nothing to tell, but only wished\r\nto show herself to him in all the splendour of her evening toilet, with\r\nher shoulders and little mole; and this was pleasant and yet repulsive\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nThe charm that had veiled all this sort of thing from Nekhludoff was\r\nnot removed, but it was as if he could see what lay beneath. Looking at\r\nMariette, he admired her, and yet he knew that she was a liar, living\r\nwith a husband who was making his career by means of the tears and lives\r\nof hundreds and hundreds of people, and that she was quite indifferent\r\nabout it, and that all she had said the day before was untrue. What she\r\nwanted--neither he nor she knew why--was to make him fall in love with\r\nher. This both attracted and disgusted him. Several times, on the point\r\nof going away, he took up his hat, and then stayed on.\r\n\r\nBut at last, when the husband returned with a strong smell of tobacco\r\nin his thick moustache, and looked at Nekhludoff with a patronising,\r\ncontemptuous air, as if not recognising him, Nekhludoff left the box\r\nbefore the door was closed again, found his overcoat, and went out of\r\nthe theatre. As he was walking home along the Nevski, he could not help\r\nnoticing a well-shaped and aggressively finely-dressed woman, who was\r\nquietly walking in front of him along the broad asphalt pavement. The\r\nconsciousness of her detestable power was noticeable in her face and\r\nthe whole of her figure. All who met or passed that woman looked at her.\r\nNekhludoff walked faster than she did and, involuntarily, also looked\r\nher in the face. The face, which was probably painted, was handsome,\r\nand the woman looked at him with a smile and her eyes sparkled. And,\r\ncuriously enough, Nekhludoff was suddenly reminded of Mariette, because\r\nhe again felt both attracted and disgusted just as when in the theatre.\r\n\r\nHaving hurriedly passed her, Nekhludoff turned off on to the Morskaya,\r\nand passed on to the embankment, where, to the surprise of a policeman,\r\nhe began pacing up and down the pavement.\r\n\r\n"The other one gave me just such a smile when I entered the theatre," he\r\nthought, "and the meaning of the smile was the same. The only difference\r\nis, that this one said plainly, \'If you want me, take me; if not, go\r\nyour way,\' and the other one pretended that she was not thinking of\r\nthis, but living in some high and refined state, while this was really\r\nat the root. Besides, this one was driven to it by necessity, while\r\nthe other amused herself by playing with that enchanting, disgusting,\r\nfrightful passion. This woman of the street was like stagnant, smelling\r\nwater offered to those whose thirst was greater than their disgust; that\r\nother one in the theatre was like the poison which, unnoticed, poisons\r\neverything it gets into."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff recalled his liaison with the Marechal\'s wife, and shameful\r\nmemories rose before him.\r\n\r\n"The animalism of the brute nature in man is disgusting," thought he,\r\n"but as long as it remains in its naked form we observe it from the\r\nheight of our spiritual life and despise it; and--whether one has\r\nfallen or resisted--one remains what one was before. But when that\r\nsame animalism hides under a cloak of poetry and aesthetic feeling and\r\ndemands our worship--then we are swallowed up by it completely, and\r\nworship animalism, no longer distinguishing good from evil. Then it is\r\nawful."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff perceived all this now as clearly as he saw the palace, the\r\nsentinels, the fortress, the river, the boats, and the Stock Exchange.\r\nAnd just as on this northern summer night there was no restful darkness\r\non the earth, but only a dismal, dull light coming from an invisible\r\nsource, so in Nekhludoff\'s soul there was no longer the restful\r\ndarkness, ignorance. Everything seemed clear. It was clear that\r\neverything considered important and good was insignificant and\r\nrepulsive, and that all the glamour and luxury hid the old, well-known\r\ncrimes, which not only remained unpunished but were adorned with all the\r\nsplendour which men were capable of inventing.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff wished to forget all this, not to see it, but he could no\r\nlonger help seeing it. Though he could not see the source of the light\r\nwhich revealed it to him any more than he could see the source of the\r\nlight which lay over Petersburg; and though the light appeared to\r\nhim dull, dismal, and unnatural, yet he could not help seeing what it\r\nrevealed, and he felt both joyful and anxious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nFOR HER SAKE AND FOR GOD\'S.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Moscow Nekhludoff went at once to the prison hospital\r\nto bring Maslova the sad news that the Senate had confirmed the decision\r\nof the Court, and that she must prepare to go to Siberia. He had little\r\nhope of the success of his petition to the Emperor, which the advocate\r\nhad written for him, and which he now brought with him for Maslova to\r\nsign. And, strange to say, he did not at present even wish to succeed;\r\nhe had got used to the thought of going to Siberia and living among the\r\nexiled and the convicts, and he could not easily picture to himself how\r\nhis life and Maslova\'s would shape if she were acquitted. He remembered\r\nthe thought of the American writer, Thoreau, who at the time when\r\nslavery existed in America said that "under a government that\r\nimprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison."\r\nNekhludoff, especially after his visit to Petersburg and all he\r\ndiscovered there, thought in the same way.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the only place befitting an honest man in Russia at the present\r\ntime is a prison," he thought, and even felt that this applied to him\r\npersonally, when he drove up to the prison and entered its walls.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper recognised Nekhludoff, and told him at once that Maslova\r\nwas no longer there.\r\n\r\n"Where is she, then?"\r\n\r\n"In the cell again."\r\n\r\n"Why has she been removed?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, your excellency, what are such people?" said the doorkeeper,\r\ncontemptuously. "She\'s been carrying on with the medical assistant, so\r\nthe head doctor ordered her back."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had had no idea how near Maslova and the state of her mind\r\nwere to him. He was stunned by the news.\r\n\r\nHe felt as one feels at the news of a great and unforeseen misfortune,\r\nand his pain was very severe. His first feeling was one of shame. He,\r\nwith his joyful idea of the change that he imagined was going on in her\r\nsoul, now seemed ridiculous in his own eyes. He thought that all her\r\npretence of not wishing to accept his sacrifice, all the reproaches and\r\ntears, were only the devices of a depraved woman, who wished to use\r\nhim to the best advantage. He seemed to remember having seen signs of\r\nobduracy at his last interview with her. All this flashed through his\r\nmind as he instinctively put on his hat and left the hospital.\r\n\r\n"What am I to do now? Am I still bound to her? Has this action of hers\r\nnot set me free?" And as he put these questions to himself he knew at\r\nonce that if he considered himself free, and threw her up, he would be\r\npunishing himself, and not her, which was what he wished to do, and he\r\nwas seized with fear.\r\n\r\n"No, what has happened cannot alter--it can only strengthen my resolve.\r\nLet her do what flows from the state her mind is in. If it is carrying\r\non with the medical assistant, let her carry on with the medical\r\nassistant; that is her business. I must do what my conscience demands of\r\nme. And my conscience expects me to sacrifice my freedom. My resolution\r\nto marry her, if only in form, and to follow wherever she may be sent,\r\nremains unalterable." Nekhludoff said all this to himself with vicious\r\nobstinacy as he left the hospital and walked with resolute steps towards\r\nthe big gates of the prison. He asked the warder on duty at the gate\r\nto inform the inspector that he wished to see Maslova. The warder knew\r\nNekhludoff, and told him of an important change that had taken place\r\nin the prison. The old inspector had been discharged, and a new, very\r\nsevere official appointed in his place.\r\n\r\n"They are so strict nowadays, it\'s just awful," said the jailer. "He is\r\nin here; they will let him know directly."\r\n\r\nThe new inspector was in the prison and soon came to Nekhludoff. He was\r\na tall, angular man, with high cheek bones, morose, and very slow in his\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n"Interviews are allowed in the visiting room on the appointed days," he\r\nsaid, without looking at Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"But I have a petition to the Emperor, which I want signed."\r\n\r\n"You can give it to me."\r\n\r\n"I must see the prisoner myself. I was always allowed to before."\r\n\r\n"That was so, before," said the inspector, with a furtive glance at\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"I have a permission from the governor," insisted Nekhludoff, and took\r\nout his pocket-book.\r\n\r\n"Allow me," said the inspector, taking the paper from Nekhludoff with\r\nhis long, dry, white fingers, on the first of which was a gold ring,\r\nstill without looking him in the eyes. He read the paper slowly. "Step\r\ninto the office, please."\r\n\r\nThis time the office was empty. The inspector sat down by the table\r\nand began sorting some papers that lay on it, evidently intending to be\r\npresent at the interview.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff asked whether he might see the political prisoner,\r\nDoukhova, the inspector answered, shortly, that he could not.\r\n"Interviews with political prisoners are not permitted," he said, and\r\nagain fixed his attention on his papers. With a letter to Doukhova in\r\nhis pocket, Nekhludoff felt as if he had committed some offence, and his\r\nplans had been discovered and frustrated.\r\n\r\nWhen Maslova entered the room the inspector raised his head, and,\r\nwithout looking at either her or Nekhludoff, remarked: "You may talk,"\r\nand went on sorting his papers. Maslova had again the white jacket,\r\npetticoat and kerchief on. When she came up to Nekhludoff and saw his\r\ncold, hard look, she blushed scarlet, and crumbling the hem of her\r\njacket with her hand, she cast down her eyes. Her confusion, so it\r\nseemed to Nekhludoff, confirmed the hospital doorkeeper\'s words.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had meant to treat her in the same way as before, but could\r\nnot bring himself to shake hands with her, so disgusting was she to him\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n"I have brought you bad news," he said, in a monotonous voice, without\r\nlooking at her or taking her hand. "The Senate has refused."\r\n\r\n"I knew it would," she said, in a strange tone, as if she were gasping\r\nfor breath.\r\n\r\nFormerly Nekhludoff would have asked why she said she knew it would;\r\nnow he only looked at her. Her eyes were full of tears. But this did not\r\nsoften him; it roused his irritation against her even more.\r\n\r\nThe inspector rose and began pacing up and down the room.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the disgust Nekhludoff was feeling at the moment, he\r\nconsidered it right to express his regret at the Senate\'s decision.\r\n\r\n"You must not despair," he said. "The petition to the Emperor may meet\r\nwith success, and I hope---"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not thinking of that," she said, looking piteously at him with her\r\nwet, squinting eyes.\r\n\r\n"What is it, then?"\r\n\r\n"You have been to the hospital, and they have most likely told you about\r\nme--"\r\n\r\n"What of that? That is your affair," said Nekhludoff coldly, and\r\nfrowned. The cruel feeling of wounded pride that had quieted down rose\r\nwith renewed force when she mentioned the hospital.\r\n\r\n"He, a man of the world, whom any girl of the best families would think\r\nit happiness to marry, offered himself as a husband to this woman,\r\nand she could not even wait, but began intriguing with the medical\r\nassistant," thought he, with a look of hatred.\r\n\r\n"Here, sign this petition," he said, taking a large envelope from his\r\npocket, and laying the paper on the table. She wiped the tears with a\r\ncorner of her kerchief, and asked what to write and where.\r\n\r\nHe showed her, and she sat down and arranged the cuff of her right\r\nsleeve with her left hand; he stood behind her, and silently looked\r\nat her back, which shook with suppressed emotion, and evil and good\r\nfeelings were fighting in his breast--feelings of wounded pride and of\r\npity for her who was suffering--and the last feeling was victorious.\r\n\r\nHe could not remember which came first; did the pity for her first enter\r\nhis heart, or did he first remember his own sins--his own repulsive\r\nactions, the very same for which he was condemning her? Anyhow, he both\r\nfelt himself guilty and pitied her.\r\n\r\nHaving signed the petition and wiped her inky finger on her petticoat,\r\nshe got up and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"Whatever happens, whatever comes of it, my resolve remains unchanged,"\r\nsaid Nekhludoff. The thought that he had forgiven her heightened his\r\nfeeling of pity and tenderness for her, and he wished to comfort her. "I\r\nwill do what I have said; wherever they take you I shall be with you."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?" she interrupted hurriedly, though her whole face\r\nlighted up.\r\n\r\n"Think what you will want on the way--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know of anything in particular, thank you."\r\n\r\nThe inspector came up, and without waiting for a remark from him\r\nNekhludoff took leave, and went out with peace, joy, and love towards\r\neverybody in his heart such as he had never felt before. The certainty\r\nthat no action of Maslova could change his love for her filled him with\r\njoy and raised him to a level which he had never before attained. Let\r\nher intrigue with the medical assistant; that was her business. He loved\r\nher not for his own but for her sake and for God\'s.\r\n\r\nAnd this intrigue, for which Maslova was turned out of the hospital,\r\nand of which Nekhludoff believed she was really guilty, consisted of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nMaslova was sent by the head nurse to get some herb tea from the\r\ndispensary at the end of the corridor, and there, all alone, she found\r\nthe medical assistant, a tall man, with a blotchy face, who had for a\r\nlong time been bothering her. In trying to get away from him Maslova\r\ngave him such a push that he knocked his head against a shelf, from\r\nwhich two bottles fell and broke. The head doctor, who was passing at\r\nthat moment, heard the sound of breaking glass, and saw Maslova run out,\r\nquite red, and shouted to her:\r\n\r\n"Ah, my good woman, if you start intriguing here, I\'ll send you about\r\nyour business. What is the meaning of it?" he went on, addressing the\r\nmedical assistant, and looking at him over his spectacles.\r\n\r\nThe assistant smiled, and began to justify himself. The doctor gave no\r\nheed to him, but, lifting his head so that he now looked through his\r\nspectacles, he entered the ward. He told the inspector the same day to\r\nsend another more sedate assistant-nurse in Maslova\'s place. And this\r\nwas her "intrigue" with the medical assistant.\r\n\r\nBeing turned out for a love intrigue was particularly painful to\r\nMaslova, because the relations with men, which had long been repulsive\r\nto her, had become specially disgusting after meeting Nekhludoff. The\r\nthought that, judging her by her past and present position, every man,\r\nthe blotchy assistant among them, considered he had a right to offend\r\nher, and was surprised at her refusal, hurt her deeply, and made her\r\npity herself and brought tears to her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen she went out to Nekhludoff this time she wished to clear herself of\r\nthe false charge which she knew he would certainly have heard about. But\r\nwhen she began to justify herself she felt he did not believe her, and\r\nthat her excuses would only strengthen his suspicions; tears choked her,\r\nand she was silent.\r\n\r\nMaslova still thought and continued to persuade herself that she had\r\nnever forgiven him, and hated him, as she told him at their second\r\ninterview, but in reality she loved him again, and loved him so that she\r\ndid all he wished her to do; left off drinking, smoking, coquetting, and\r\nentered the hospital because she knew he wished it. And if every time he\r\nreminded her of it, she refused so decidedly to accept his sacrifice and\r\nmarry him, it was because she liked repeating the proud words she had\r\nonce uttered, and because she knew that a marriage with her would be a\r\nmisfortune for him.\r\n\r\nShe had resolutely made up her mind that she would not accept his\r\nsacrifice, and yet the thought that he despised her and believed that\r\nshe still was what she had been, and did not notice the change that had\r\ntaken place in her, was very painful. That he could still think she had\r\ndone wrong while in the hospital tormented her more than the news that\r\nher sentence was confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE ASTONISHING INSTITUTION CALLED CRIMINAL LAW.\r\n\r\nMaslova might be sent off with the first gang of prisoners, therefore\r\nNekhludoff got ready for his departure. But there was so much to be done\r\nthat he felt that he could not finish it, however much time he might\r\nhave. It was quite different now from what it had been. Formerly he used\r\nto be obliged to look for an occupation, the interest of which always\r\ncentred in one person, i.e., Dmitri Ivanovitch Nekhludoff, and\r\nyet, though every interest of his life was thus centred, all these\r\noccupations were very wearisome. Now all his occupations related to\r\nother people and not to Dmitri Ivanovitch, and they were all interesting\r\nand attractive, and there was no end to them. Nor was this all. Formerly\r\nDmitri Ivanovitch Nekhludoff\'s occupations always made him feel vexed\r\nand irritable; now they produced a joyful state of mind. The business at\r\npresent occupying Nekhludoff could be divided under three headings.\r\nHe himself, with his usual pedantry, divided it in that way, and\r\naccordingly kept the papers referring to it in three different\r\nportfolios. The first referred to Maslova, and was chiefly that of\r\ntaking steps to get her petition to the Emperor attended to, and\r\npreparing for her probable journey to Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe second was about his estates. In Panovo he had given the land to\r\nthe peasants on condition of their paying rent to be put to their own\r\ncommunal use. But he had to confirm this transaction by a legal deed,\r\nand to make his will, in accordance with it. In Kousminski the state of\r\nthings was still as he had first arranged it, i.e., he was to receive\r\nthe rent; but the terms had to be fixed, and also how much of the money\r\nhe would use to live on, and how much he would leave for the peasants\'\r\nuse. As he did not know what his journey to Siberia would cost him, he\r\ncould not decide to lose this revenue altogether, though he reduced the\r\nincome from it by half.\r\n\r\nThe third part of his business was to help the convicts, who applied\r\nmore and more often to him. At first when he came in contact with\r\nthe prisoners, and they appealed to him for help, he at once began\r\ninterceding for them, hoping to lighten their fate, but he soon had so\r\nmany applications that he felt the impossibility of attending to all of\r\nthem, and that naturally led him to take up another piece of work, which\r\nat last roused his interest even more than the three first. This new\r\npart of his business was finding an answer to the following questions:\r\nWhat was this astonishing institution called criminal law, of which the\r\nresults were that in the prison, with some of the inmates of which\r\nhe had lately become acquainted, and in all those other places of\r\nconfinement, from the Peter and Paul Fortress in Petersburg to the\r\nisland of Sakhalin, hundreds and thousands of victims were pining? What\r\ndid this strange criminal law exist for? How had it originated?\r\n\r\nFrom his personal relations with the prisoners, from notes by some of\r\nthose in confinement, and by questioning the advocate and the prison\r\npriest, Nekhludoff came to the conclusion that the convicts, the\r\nso-called criminals, could be divided into five classes. The first were\r\nquite innocent people, condemned by judicial blunder. Such were the\r\nMenshoffs, supposed to be incendiaries, Maslova, and others. There\r\nwere not many of these; according to the priest\'s words, only seven per\r\ncent., but their condition excited particular interest.\r\n\r\nTo the second class belong persons condemned for actions done under\r\npeculiar circumstances, i.e., in a fit of passion, jealousy, or\r\ndrunkenness, circumstances under which those who judged them would\r\nsurely have committed the same actions.\r\n\r\nThe third class consisted of people punished for having committed\r\nactions which, according to their understanding, were quite natural,\r\nand even good, but which those other people, the men who made the laws,\r\nconsidered to be crimes. Such were the persons who sold spirits without\r\na license, smugglers, those who gathered grass and wood on large estates\r\nand in the forests belonging to the Crown; the thieving miners; and\r\nthose unbelieving people who robbed churches.\r\n\r\nTo the fourth class belonged those who were imprisoned only because they\r\nstood morally higher than the average level of society. Such were the\r\nSectarians, the Poles, the Circassians rebelling in order to regain\r\ntheir independence, the political prisoners, the Socialists, the\r\nstrikers condemned for withstanding the authorities. There was,\r\naccording to Nekhludoff\'s observations, a very large percentage\r\nbelonging to this class; among them some of the best of men.\r\n\r\nThe fifth class consisted of persons who had been far more sinned\r\nagainst by society than they had sinned against it. These were\r\ncastaways, stupefied by continual oppression and temptation, such as the\r\nboy who had stolen the rugs, and hundreds of others whom Nekhludoff had\r\nseen in the prison and out of it. The conditions under which they lived\r\nseemed to lead on systematically to those actions which are termed\r\ncrimes. A great many thieves and murderers with whom he had lately come\r\nin contact, according to Nekhludoff\'s estimate, belonged to this class.\r\nTo this class Nekhludoff also reckoned those depraved, demoralised\r\ncreatures whom the new school of criminology classify as the criminal\r\ntype, and the existence of which is considered to be the chief proof\r\nof the necessity of criminal law and punishment. This demoralised,\r\ndepraved, abnormal type was, according to Nekhludoff, exactly the same\r\nas that against whom society had sinned, only here society had sinned\r\nnot directly against them, but against their parents and forefathers.\r\n\r\nAmong this latter class Nekhludoff was specially struck by one Okhotin,\r\nan inveterate thief, the illegitimate son of a prostitute, brought up\r\nin a doss-house, who, up to the age of 30, had apparently never met with\r\nany one whose morality was above that of a policeman, and who had\r\ngot into a band of thieves when quite young. He was gifted with an\r\nextraordinary sense of humour, by means of which he made himself very\r\nattractive. He asked Nekhludoff for protection, at the same time making\r\nfun of himself, the lawyers, the prison, and laws human and divine.\r\n\r\nAnother was the handsome Fedoroff, who, with a band of robbers, of\r\nwhom he was the chief, had robbed and murdered an old man, an official.\r\nFedoroff was a peasant, whose father had been unlawfully deprived of his\r\nhouse, and who, later on, when serving as a soldier, had suffered much\r\nbecause he had fallen in love with an officer\'s mistress. He had a\r\nfascinating, passionate nature, that longed for enjoyment at any cost.\r\nHe had never met anybody who restrained himself for any cause whatever,\r\nand had never heard a word about any aim in life other than enjoyment.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff distinctly saw that both these men were richly endowed by\r\nnature, but had been neglected and crippled like uncared-for plants.\r\n\r\nHe had also met a tramp and a woman who had repelled him by their\r\ndulness and seeming cruelty, but even in them he could find no trace of\r\nthe criminal type written about by the Italian school, but only saw in\r\nthem people who were repulsive to him personally, just in the same way\r\nas some he had met outside the prison, in swallow-tail coats wearing\r\nepaulettes, or bedecked with lace. And so the investigation of the\r\nreasons why all these very different persons were put in prison, while\r\nothers just like them were going about free and even judging them,\r\nformed a fourth task for Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nHe hoped to find an answer to this question in books, and bought all\r\nthat referred to it. He got the works of Lombroso, Garofalo, Ferry,\r\nList, Maudsley, Tard, and read them carefully. But as he read he became\r\nmore and more disappointed. It happened to him as it always happens\r\nto those who turn to science not in order to play a part in it, nor\r\nto write, nor to dispute, nor to teach, but simply for an answer to an\r\nevery-day question of life. Science answered thousands of different very\r\nsubtle and ingenious questions touching criminal law, but not the one\r\nhe was trying to solve. He asked a very simple question: "Why, and\r\nwith what right, do some people lock up, torment, exile, flog, and kill\r\nothers, while they are themselves just like those whom they torment,\r\nflog, and kill?" And in answer he got deliberations as to whether human\r\nbeings had free will or not. Whether signs of criminality could be\r\ndetected by measuring the skulls or not. What part heredity played in\r\ncrime. Whether immorality could be inherited. What madness is, what\r\ndegeneration is, and what temperament is. How climate, food, ignorance,\r\nimitativeness, hypnotism, or passion act. What society is. What are its\r\nduties, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThese disquisitions reminded him of the answer he once got from a little\r\nboy whom he met coming home from school. Nekhludoff asked him if he had\r\nlearned his spelling.\r\n\r\n"I have," answered the boy.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, tell me, how do you spell \'leg\'?"\r\n\r\n"A dog\'s leg, or what kind of leg?" the boy answered, with a sly look.\r\n\r\nAnswers in the form of new questions, like the boy\'s, was all Nekhludoff\r\ngot in reply to his one primary question. He found much that was clever,\r\nlearned much that was interesting, but what he did not find was an\r\nanswer to the principal question: By what right some people punish\r\nothers?\r\n\r\nNot only did he not find any answer, but all the arguments were brought\r\nforward in order to explain and vindicate punishment, the necessity of\r\nwhich was taken as an axiom.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff read much, but only in snatches, and putting down his failure\r\nto this superficial way of reading, hoped to find the answer later on.\r\nHe would not allow himself to believe in the truth of the answer which\r\nbegan, more and more often, to present itself to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF\'S SISTER AND HER HUSBAND.\r\n\r\nThe gang of prisoners, with Maslova among them, was to start on the 5th\r\nJuly. Nekhludoff arranged to start on the same day.\r\n\r\nThe day before, Nekhludoff\'s sister and her husband came to town to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff\'s sister, Nathalie Ivanovna Rogozhinsky, was 10 years older\r\nthan her brother. She had been very fond of him when he was a boy, and\r\nlater on, just before her marriage, they grew very close to each other,\r\nas if they were equals, she being a young woman of 25, he a lad of 15.\r\nAt that time she was in love with his friend, Nikolenka Irtenieff, since\r\ndead. They both loved Nikolenka, and loved in him and in themselves that\r\nwhich is good, and which unites all men. Since then they had both been\r\ndepraved, he by military service and a vicious life, she by marriage\r\nwith a man whom she loved with a sensual love, who did not care for the\r\nthings that had once been so dear and holy to her and to her brother,\r\nnor even understand the meaning of those aspirations towards moral\r\nperfection and the service of mankind, which once constituted her life,\r\nand put them down to ambition and the wish to show off; that being the\r\nonly explanation comprehensible to him.\r\n\r\nNathalie\'s husband had been a man without a name and without means, but\r\ncleverly steering towards Liberalism or Conservatism, according to which\r\nbest suited his purpose, he managed to make a comparatively brilliant\r\njudicial career. Some peculiarity which made him attractive to women\r\nassisted him when he was no longer in his first youth. While travelling\r\nabroad he made Nekhludoff\'s acquaintance, and managed to make Nathalie,\r\nwho was also no longer a girl, fall in love with him, rather against her\r\nmother\'s wishes who considered a marriage with him to be a misalliance\r\nfor her daughter. Nekhludoff, though he tried to hide it from himself,\r\nthough he fought against it, hated his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff had a strong antipathy towards him because of the vulgarity\r\nof his feelings, his assurance and narrowness, but chiefly because of\r\nNathalie, who managed to love him in spite of the narrowness of his\r\nnature, and loved him so selfishly, so sensually, and stifled for his\r\nsake all the good that had been in her.\r\n\r\nIt always hurt Nekhludoff to think of Nathalie as the wife of that\r\nhairy, self-assured man with the shiny, bald patch on his head. He could\r\nnot even master a feeling of revulsion towards their children, and when\r\nhe heard that she was again going to have a baby, he felt something like\r\nsorrow that she had once more been infected with something bad by this\r\nman who was so foreign to him. The Rogozhinskys had come to Moscow\r\nalone, having left their two children--a boy and a girl--at home, and\r\nstopped in the best rooms of the best hotel. Nathalie at once went to\r\nher mother\'s old house, but hearing from Agraphena Petrovna that her\r\nbrother had left, and was living in a lodging-house, she drove there.\r\nThe dirty servant met her in the stuffy passage, dark but for a lamp\r\nwhich burnt there all day. He told her that the Prince was not in.\r\n\r\nNathalie asked to be shown into his rooms, as she wished to leave a note\r\nfor him, and the man took her up.\r\n\r\nNathalie carefully examined her brother\'s two little rooms. She noticed\r\nin everything the love of cleanliness and order she knew so well in\r\nhim, and was struck by the novel simplicity of the surroundings. On his\r\nwriting-table she saw the paper-weight with the bronze dog on the top\r\nwhich she remembered; the tidy way in which his different portfolios and\r\nwriting utensils were placed on the table was also familiar, and so was\r\nthe large, crooked ivory paper knife which marked the place in a French\r\nbook by Tard, which lay with other volumes on punishment and a book\r\nin English by Henry George. She sat down at the table and wrote a note\r\nasking him to be sure to come that same day, and shaking her head in\r\nsurprise at what she saw, she returned to her hotel.\r\n\r\nTwo questions regarding her brother now interested Nathalie: his\r\nmarriage with Katusha, which she had heard spoken about in their\r\ntown--for everybody was speaking about it--and his giving away the land\r\nto the peasants, which was also known, and struck many as something of\r\na political nature, and dangerous. The marriage with Katusha pleased\r\nher in a way. She admired that resoluteness which was so like him and\r\nherself as they used to be in those happy times before her marriage. And\r\nyet she was horrified when she thought her brother was going to marry\r\nsuch a dreadful woman. The latter was the stronger feeling of the two,\r\nand she decided to use all her influence to prevent him from doing it,\r\nthough she knew how difficult this would be.\r\n\r\nThe other matter, the giving up of the land to the peasants, did not\r\ntouch her so nearly, but her husband was very indignant about it, and\r\nexpected her to influence her brother against it.\r\n\r\nRogozhinsky said that such an action was the height of inconsistency,\r\nflightiness, and pride, the only possible explanation of which was the\r\ndesire to appear original, to brag, to make one\'s self talked about.\r\n\r\n"What sense could there be in letting the land to the peasants, on\r\ncondition that they pay the rent to themselves?" he said. "If he was\r\nresolved to do such a thing, why not sell the land to them through the\r\nPeasants\' Bank? There might have been some sense in that. In fact, this\r\nact verges on insanity."\r\n\r\nAnd Rogozhinsky began seriously thinking about putting Nekhludoff under\r\nguardianship, and demanded of his wife that she should speak seriously\r\nto her brother about his curious intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF\'S ANARCHISM.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Nekhludoff returned that evening and saw his sister\'s note\r\non the table he started to go and see her. He found Nathalie alone,\r\nher husband having gone to take a rest in the next room. She wore a\r\ntightly-fitting black silk dress, with a red bow in front. Her black\r\nhair was crimped and arranged according to the latest fashion.\r\n\r\nThe pains she took to appear young, for the sake of her husband, whose\r\nequal she was in years, were very obvious.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw her brother she jumped up and hurried towards him, with her\r\nsilk dress rustling. They kissed, and looked smilingly at each other.\r\nThere passed between them that mysterious exchange of looks, full of\r\nmeaning, in which all was true, and which cannot be expressed in words.\r\nThen came words which were not true. They had not met since their\r\nmother\'s death.\r\n\r\n"You have grown stouter and younger," he said, and her lips puckered up\r\nwith pleasure.\r\n\r\n"And you have grown thinner."\r\n\r\n"Well, and how is your husband?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"He is taking a rest; he did not sleep all night." There was much to\r\nsay, but it was not said in words; only their looks expressed what their\r\nwords failed to say.\r\n\r\n"I went to see you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. I moved because the house is too big for me. I was lonely\r\nthere, and dull. I want nothing of all that is there, so that you had\r\nbetter take it all--the furniture, I mean, and things."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Agraphena Petrovna told me. I went there. Thanks, very much.\r\nBut--"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the hotel waiter brought in a silver tea-set. While he\r\nset the table they were silent. Then Nathalie sat down at the table and\r\nmade the tea, still in silence. Nekhludoff also said nothing.\r\n\r\nAt last Nathalie began resolutely. "Well, Dmitri, I know all about it."\r\nAnd she looked at him.\r\n\r\n"What of that? l am glad you know."\r\n\r\n"How can you hope to reform her after the life she has led?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe sat quite straight on a small chair, and listened attentively, trying\r\nto understand her and to answer rightly. The state of mind called forth\r\nin him by his last interview with Maslova still filled his soul with\r\nquiet joy and good will to all men.\r\n\r\n"It is not her but myself I wish to reform," he replied.\r\n\r\nNathalie sighed.\r\n\r\n"There are other means besides marriage to do that."\r\n\r\n"But I think it is the best. Besides, it leads me into that world in\r\nwhich I can be of use."\r\n\r\n"I cannot believe you will be happy," said Nathalie.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not my happiness that is the point."\r\n\r\n"Of course, but if she has a heart she cannot be happy--cannot even wish\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"She does not wish it."\r\n\r\n"I understand; but life--"\r\n\r\n"Yes--life?"\r\n\r\n"Demands something different."\r\n\r\n"It demands nothing but that we should do what is right," said\r\nNekhludoff, looking into her face, still handsome, though slightly\r\nwrinkled round eyes and mouth.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand," she said, and sighed.\r\n\r\n"Poor darling; how could she change so?" he thought, calling back to his\r\nmind Nathalie as she had been before her marriage, and feeling towards\r\nher a tenderness woven out of innumerable memories of childhood. At that\r\nmoment Rogozhinsky entered the room, with head thrown back and expanded\r\nchest, and stepping lightly and softly in his usual manner, his\r\nspectacles, his bald patch, and his black beard all glistening.\r\n\r\n"How do you do? How do you do?" he said, laying an unnatural and\r\nintentional stress on his words. (Though, soon after the marriage,\r\nthey had tried to be more familiar with each other, they had never\r\nsucceeded.)\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and Rogozhinsky sank softly into an easy-chair.\r\n\r\n"Am I not interrupting your conversation?"\r\n\r\n"No, I do not wish to hide what I am saying or doing from any one."\r\n\r\nAs soon as Nekhludoff saw the hairy hands, and heard the patronising,\r\nself-assured tones, his meekness left him in a moment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we were talking about his intentions," said Nathalie. "Shall I\r\ngive you a cup of tea?" she added, taking the teapot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, please. What particular intentions do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"That of going to Siberia with the gang of prisoners, among whom is the\r\nwoman I consider myself to have wronged," uttered Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"I hear not only to accompany her, but more than that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and to marry her if she wishes it."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! But if you do not object I should like to ask you to explain\r\nyour motives. I do not understand them."\r\n\r\n"My motives are that this woman--that this woman\'s first step on her way\r\nto degradation--" Nekhludoff got angry with himself, and was unable to\r\nfind the right expression. "My motives are that I am the guilty one, and\r\nshe gets the punishment."\r\n\r\n"If she is being punished she cannot be innocent, either."\r\n\r\n"She is quite innocent." And Nekhludoff related the whole incident with\r\nunnecessary warmth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was a case of carelessness on the part of the president, the\r\nresult of which was a thoughtless answer on the part of the jury; but\r\nthere is the Senate for cases like that."\r\n\r\n"The Senate has rejected the appeal."\r\n\r\n"Well, if the Senate has rejected it, there cannot have been sufficient\r\nreasons for an appeal," said Rogozhinsky, evidently sharing the\r\nprevailing opinion that truth is the product of judicial decrees. "The\r\nSenate cannot enter into the question on its merits. If there is a real\r\nmistake, the Emperor should be petitioned."\r\n\r\n"That has been done, but there is no probability of success. They will\r\napply to the Department of the Ministry, the Department will consult the\r\nSenate, the Senate will repeat its decision, and, as usual, the innocent\r\nwill get punished."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, the Department of the Ministry won\'t consult the\r\nSenate," said Rogozhinsky, with a condescending smile; "it will give\r\norders for the original deeds to be sent from the Law Court, and if\r\nit discovers a mistake it will decide accordingly. And, secondly, the\r\ninnocent are never punished, or at least in very rare, exceptional\r\ncases. It is the guilty who are punished," Rogozhinsky said\r\ndeliberately, and smiled self-complacently.\r\n\r\n"And I have become fully convinced that most of those condemned by law\r\nare innocent."\r\n\r\n"How\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Innocent in the literal sense. Just as this woman is innocent of\r\npoisoning any one; as innocent as a peasant I have just come to know, of\r\nthe murder he never committed; as a mother and son who were on the point\r\nof being condemned for incendiarism, which was committed by the owner of\r\nthe house that was set on fire."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course there always have been and always will be judicial\r\nerrors. Human institutions cannot be perfect."\r\n\r\n"And, besides, there are a great many people convicted who are innocent\r\nof doing anything considered wrong by the society they have grown up\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, this is not so; every thief knows that stealing is wrong,\r\nand that we should not steal; that it is immoral," said Rogozhinsky,\r\nwith his quiet, self-assured, slightly contemptuous smile, which\r\nspecially irritated Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No, he does not know it; they say to him \'don\'t steal,\' and he knows\r\nthat the master of the factory steals his labour by keeping back his\r\nwages; that the Government, with its officials, robs him continually by\r\ntaxation."\r\n\r\n"Why, this is anarchism," Rogozhinsky said, quietly defining his\r\nbrother-in-law\'s words.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it is; I am only telling you the truth," Nekhludoff\r\ncontinued. "He knows that the Government is robbing him, knows that we\r\nlanded proprietors have robbed him long since, robbed him of the land\r\nwhich should be the common property of all, and then, if he picks up dry\r\nwood to light his fire on that land stolen from him, we put him in jail,\r\nand try to persuade him that he is a thief. Of course he knows that not\r\nhe but those who robbed him of the land are thieves, and that to get any\r\nrestitution of what has been robbed is his duty towards his family."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand, or if I do I cannot agree with it. The land must\r\nbe somebody\'s property," began Rogozhinsky quietly, and, convinced that\r\nNekhludoff was a Socialist, and that Socialism demands that all the land\r\nshould be divided equally, that such a division would be very foolish,\r\nand that he could easily prove it to be so, he said. "If you divided\r\nit equally to-day, it would to-morrow be again in the hands of the most\r\nindustrious and clever."\r\n\r\n"Nobody is thinking of dividing the land equally. The land must not\r\nbe anybody\'s property; must not be a thing to be bought and sold or\r\nrented."\r\n\r\n"The rights of property are inborn in man; without them the cultivation\r\nof land would present no interest. Destroy the rights of property and\r\nwe lapse into barbarism." Rogozhinsky uttered this authoritatively,\r\nrepeating the usual argument in favour of private ownership of land\r\nwhich is supposed to be irrefutable, based on the assumption that\r\npeople\'s desire to possess land proves that they need it.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, only when the land is nobody\'s property will it cease\r\nto lie idle, as it does now, while the landlords, like dogs in the\r\nmanger, unable themselves to put it to use, will not let those use it\r\nwho are able."\r\n\r\n"But, Dmitri Ivanovitch, what you are saying is sheer madness. Is it\r\npossible to abolish property in land in our age? I know it is your old\r\nhobby. But allow me to tell you straight," and Rogozhinsky grew pale,\r\nand his voice trembled. It was evident that this question touched him\r\nvery nearly. "I should advise you to consider this question well before\r\nattempting to solve it practically."\r\n\r\n"Are you speaking of my personal affairs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hold that we who are placed in special circumstances should\r\nbear the responsibilities which spring from those circumstances, should\r\nuphold the conditions in which we were born, and which we have\r\ninherited from our predecessors, and which we ought to pass on to our\r\ndescendants."\r\n\r\n"I consider it my duty--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit," said Rogozhinsky, not permitting the interruption. "I am\r\nnot speaking for myself or my children. The position of my children is\r\nassured, and I earn enough for us to live comfortably, and I expect my\r\nchildren will live so too, so that my interest in your action--which,\r\nif you will allow me to say so, is not well considered--is not based\r\non personal motives; it is on principle that I cannot agree with you. I\r\nshould advise you to think it well over, to read---?"\r\n\r\n"Please allow me to settle my affairs, and to choose what to read and\r\nwhat not to read, myself," said Nekhludoff, turning pale. Feeling\r\nhis hands grow cold, and that he was no longer master of himself, he\r\nstopped, and began drinking his tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE AIM OF THE LAW.\r\n\r\n"Well, and how are the children?" Nekhludoff asked his sister when he\r\nwas calmer. The sister told him about the children. She said they were\r\nstaying with their grandmother (their father\'s mother), and, pleased\r\nthat his dispute with her husband had come to an end, she began telling\r\nhim how her children played that they were travelling, just as he used\r\nto do with his three dolls, one of them a negro and another which he\r\ncalled the French lady.\r\n\r\n"Can you really remember it all?" said Nekhludoff, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and just fancy, they play in the very same way."\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant conversation had been brought to an end, and Nathalie was\r\nquieter, but she did not care to talk in her husband\'s presence of what\r\ncould be comprehensible only to her brother, so, wishing to start a\r\ngeneral conversation, she began talking about the sorrow of Kamenski\'s\r\nmother at losing her only son, who had fallen in a duel, for this\r\nPetersburg topic of the day had now reached Moscow. Rogozhinsky\r\nexpressed disapproval at the state of things that excluded murder in a\r\nduel from the ordinary criminal offences. This remark evoked a rejoinder\r\nfrom Nekhludoff, and a new dispute arose on the subject. Nothing was\r\nfully explained, neither of the antagonists expressed all he had in\r\nhis mind, each keeping to his conviction, which condemned the other.\r\nRogozhinsky felt that Nekhludoff condemned him and despised his\r\nactivity, and he wished to show him the injustice of his opinions.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff, on the other hand, felt provoked by his brother-in-law\'s\r\ninterference in his affairs concerning the land. And knowing in his\r\nheart of hearts that his sister, her husband, and their children, as his\r\nheirs, had a right to do so, was indignant that this narrow-minded\r\nman persisted with calm assurance to regard as just and lawful what\r\nNekhludoff no longer doubted was folly and crime.\r\n\r\nThis man\'s arrogance annoyed Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"What could the law do?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It could sentence one of the two duellists to the mines like an\r\nordinary murderer."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff\'s hands grew cold.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what good would that be?" he asked, hotly.\r\n\r\n"It would be just."\r\n\r\n"As if justice were the aim of the law," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"What else?"\r\n\r\n"The upholding of class interests! I think the law is only an instrument\r\nfor upholding the existing order of things beneficial to our class."\r\n\r\n"This is a perfectly new view," said Rogozhinsky with a quiet smile;\r\n"the law is generally supposed to have a totally different aim."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so it has in theory but not in practice, as I have found out. The\r\nlaw aims only at preserving the present state of things, and therefore\r\nit persecutes and executes those who stand above the ordinary level and\r\nwish to raise it--the so-called political prisoners, as well as those\r\nwho are below the average--the so-called criminal types."\r\n\r\n"I do not agree with you. In the first place, I cannot admit that the\r\ncriminals classed as political are punished because they are above the\r\naverage. In most cases they are the refuse of society, just as much\r\nperverted, though in a different way, as the criminal types whom you\r\nconsider below the average."\r\n\r\n"But I happen to know men who are morally far above their judges; all\r\nthe sectarians are moral, from--"\r\n\r\nBut Rogozhinsky, a man not accustomed to be interrupted when he spoke,\r\ndid not listen to Nekhludoff, but went on talking at the same time,\r\nthereby irritating him still more.\r\n\r\n"Nor can I admit that the object of the law is the upholding of the\r\npresent state of things. The law aims at reforming--"\r\n\r\n"A nice kind of reform, in a prison!" Nekhludoff put in.\r\n\r\n"Or removing," Rogozhinsky went on, persistently, "the perverted and\r\nbrutalised persons that threaten society."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what it doesn\'t do. Society has not the means of doing\r\neither the one thing or the other."\r\n\r\n"How is that? I don\'t understand," said Rogozhinsky with a forced smile.\r\n\r\n"I mean that only two reasonable kinds of punishment exist. Those used\r\nin the old days: corporal and capital punishment, which, as human nature\r\ngradually softens, come more and more into disuse," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"There, now, this is quite new and very strange to hear from your lips."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is reasonable to hurt a man so that he should not do in future\r\nwhat he is hurt for doing, and it is also quite reasonable to cut a\r\nman\'s head off when he is injurious or dangerous to society. These\r\npunishments have a reasonable meaning. But what sense is there in\r\nlocking up in a prison a man perverted by want of occupation and bad\r\nexample; to place him in a position where he is provided for, where\r\nlaziness is imposed on him, and where he is in company with the most\r\nperverted of men? What reason is there to take a man at public cost (it\r\ncomes to more than 500 roubles per head) from the Toula to the Irkoatsk\r\ngovernment, or from Koursk--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but all the same, people are afraid of those journeys at public\r\ncost, and if it were not for such journeys and the prisons, you and I\r\nwould not be sitting here as we are."\r\n\r\n"The prisons cannot insure our safety, because these people do not\r\nstay there for ever, but are set free again. On the contrary, in those\r\nestablishments men are brought to the greatest vice and degradation, so\r\nthat the danger is increased."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say that the penitentiary system should be improved."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be improved. Improved prisons would cost more than all that\r\nis being now spent on the people\'s education, and would lay a still\r\nheavier burden on the people."\r\n\r\n"The shortcomings of the penitentiary system in nowise invalidate\r\nthe law itself," Rogozhinsky continued again, without heeding his\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"There is no remedy for these shortcomings," said Nekhludoff, raising\r\nhis voice.\r\n\r\n"What of that? Shall we therefore go and kill, or, as a certain\r\nstatesman proposed, go putting out people\'s eyes?" Rogozhinsky remarked.\r\n\r\n"Yes; that would be cruel, but it would be effective. What is done\r\nnow is cruel, and not only ineffective, but so stupid that one cannot\r\nunderstand how people in their senses can take part in so absurd and\r\ncruel a business as criminal law."\r\n\r\n"But I happen to take part in it," said Rogozhinsky, growing pale.\r\n\r\n"That is your business. But to me it is incomprehensible."\r\n\r\n"I think there are a good many things incomprehensible to you," said\r\nRogozhinsky, with a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n"I have seen how one public prosecutor did his very best to get an\r\nunfortunate boy condemned, who could have evoked nothing but sympathy in\r\nan unperverted mind. I know how another cross-examined a sectarian and\r\nput down the reading of the Gospels as a criminal offence; in fact, the\r\nwhole business of the Law Courts consists in senseless and cruel actions\r\nof that sort."\r\n\r\n"I should not serve if I thought so," said Rogozhinsky, rising.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff noticed a peculiar glitter under his brother-in-law\'s\r\nspectacles. "Can it be tears?" he thought. And they were really tears\r\nof injured pride. Rogozhinsky went up to the window, got out his\r\nhandkerchief, coughed and rubbed his spectacles, took them off, and\r\nwiped his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the sofa he lit a cigar, and did not speak any more.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff felt pained and ashamed of having offended his brother-in-law\r\nand his sister to such a degree, especially as he was going away the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nHe parted with them in confusion, and drove home.\r\n\r\n"All I have said may be true--anyhow he did not reply. But it was not\r\nsaid in the right way. How little I must have changed if I could be\r\ncarried away by ill-feeling to such an extent as to hurt and wound poor\r\nNathalie in such a way!" he thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONERS START FOR SIBERIA.\r\n\r\nThe gang of prisoners, among whom was Maslova, was to leave Moscow by\r\nrail at 3 p.m.; therefore, in order to see the gang start, and walk\r\nto the station with the prisoners Nekhludoff meant to reach the prison\r\nbefore 12 o\'clock.\r\n\r\nThe night before, as he was packing up and sorting his papers, he came\r\nupon his diary, and read some bits here and there. The last bit written\r\nbefore he left for Petersburg ran thus: "Katusha does not wish to accept\r\nmy sacrifice; she wishes to make a sacrifice herself. She has conquered,\r\nand so have I. She makes me happy by the inner change, which seems\r\nto me, though I fear to believe it, to be going on in her. I fear to\r\nbelieve it, yet she seems to be coming back to life." Then further on\r\nhe read. "I have lived through something very hard and very joyful. I\r\nlearnt that she has behaved very badly in the hospital, and I suddenly\r\nfelt great pain. I never expected that it could be so painful. I spoke\r\nto her with loathing and hatred, then all of a sudden I called to mind\r\nhow many times I have been, and even still am, though but in thought,\r\nguilty of the thing that I hated her for, and immediately I became\r\ndisgusting to myself, and pitied her and felt happy again. If only we\r\ncould manage to see the beam in our own eye in time, how kind we\r\nshould be." Then he wrote: "I have been to see Nathalie, and again\r\nself-satisfaction made me unkind and spiteful, and a heavy feeling\r\nremains. Well, what is to be done? Tomorrow a new life will begin. A\r\nfinal good-bye to the old! Many new impressions have accumulated, but I\r\ncannot yet bring them to unity."\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke the next morning Nekhludoff\'s first feeling was regret\r\nabout the affair between him and his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"I cannot go away like this," he thought. "I must go and make it up with\r\nthem." But when he looked at his watch he saw that he had not time to\r\ngo, but must hurry so as not to be too late for the departure of the\r\ngang. He hastily got everything ready, and sent the things to the\r\nstation with a servant and Taras, Theodosia\'s husband, who was going\r\nwith them. Then he took the first isvostchik he could find and drove off\r\nto the prison.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners\' train started two hours before the train by which he was\r\ngoing, so Nekhludoff paid his bill in the lodgings and left for good.\r\n\r\nIt was July, and the weather was unbearably hot. From the stones, the\r\nwalls, the iron of the roofs, which the sultry night had not cooled, the\r\nheat streamed into the motionless air. When at rare intervals a slight\r\nbreeze did arise, it brought but a whiff of hot air filled with dust and\r\nsmelling of oil paint.\r\n\r\nThere were few people in the streets, and those who were out tried to\r\nkeep on the shady side. Only the sunburnt peasants, with their bronzed\r\nfaces and bark shoes on their feet, who were mending the road, sat\r\nhammering the stones into the burning sand in the sun; while the\r\npolicemen, in their holland blouses, with revolvers fastened with\r\norange cords, stood melancholy and depressed in the middle of the road,\r\nchanging from foot to foot; and the tramcars, the horses of which wore\r\nholland hoods on their heads, with slits for the ears, kept passing up\r\nand down the sunny road with ringing bells.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff drove up to the prison the gang had not left the yard.\r\nThe work of delivering and receiving the prisoners that had commenced\r\nat 4 A.M. was still going on. The gang was to consist of 623 men and 64\r\nwomen; they had all to be received according to the registry lists.\r\nThe sick and the weak to be sorted out, and all to be delivered to the\r\nconvoy. The new inspector, with two assistants, the doctor and medical\r\nassistant, the officer of the convoy, and the clerk, were sitting in the\r\nprison yard at a table covered with writing materials and papers, which\r\nwas placed in the shade of a wall. They called the prisoners one by one,\r\nexamined and questioned them, and took notes. The rays of the sun had\r\ngradually reached the table, and it was growing very hot and oppressive\r\nfor want of air and because of the breathing crowd of prisoners that\r\nstood close by.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, will this never come to an end!" the convoy officer,\r\na tall, fat, red-faced man with high shoulders, who kept puffing the\r\nsmoke, of his cigarette into his thick moustache, asked, as he drew in\r\na long puff. "You are killing me. From where have you got them all? Are\r\nthere many more?" the clerk inquired.\r\n\r\n"Twenty-four men and the women."\r\n\r\n"What are you standing there for? Come on," shouted the convoy officer\r\nto the prisoners who had not yet passed the revision, and who stood\r\ncrowded one behind the other. The prisoners had been standing there more\r\nthan three hours, packed in rows in the full sunlight, waiting their\r\nturns.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on in the prison yard, outside the gate, besides\r\nthe sentinel who stood there as usual with a gun, were drawn up about 20\r\ncarts, to carry the luggage of the prisoners and such prisoners as were\r\ntoo weak to walk, and a group of relatives and friends waiting to see\r\nthe prisoners as they came out and to exchange a few words if a chance\r\npresented itself and to give them a few things. Nekhludoff took his\r\nplace among the group. He had stood there about an hour when the\r\nclanking of chains, the noise of footsteps, authoritative voices, the\r\nsound of coughing, and the low murmur of a large crowd became audible.\r\n\r\nThis continued for about five minutes, during which several jailers went\r\nin and out of the gateway. At last the word of command was given. The\r\ngate opened with a thundering noise, the clattering of the chains became\r\nlouder, and the convoy soldiers, dressed in white blouses and carrying\r\nguns, came out into the street and took their places in a large, exact\r\ncircle in front of the gate; this was evidently a usual, often-practised\r\nmanoeuvre. Then another command was given, and the prisoners began\r\ncoming out in couples, with flat, pancake-shaped caps on their shaved\r\nheads and sacks over their shoulders, dragging their chained legs and\r\nswinging one arm, while the other held up a sack.\r\n\r\nFirst came the men condemned to hard labour, all dressed alike in grey\r\ntrousers and cloaks with marks on the back. All of them--young and old,\r\nthin and fat, pale and red, dark and bearded and beardless, Russians,\r\nTartars, and Jews--came out, clattering with their chains and briskly\r\nswinging their arms as if prepared to go a long distance, but stopped\r\nafter having taken ten steps, and obediently took their places behind\r\neach other, four abreast. Then without interval streamed out more shaved\r\nmen, dressed in the same manner but with chains only on their legs.\r\nThese were condemned to exile. They came out as briskly and stopped as\r\nsuddenly, taking their places four in a row. Then came those exiled by\r\ntheir Communes. Then the women in the same order, first those condemned\r\nto hard labour, with grey cloaks and kerchiefs; then the exiled women,\r\nand those following their husbands of their own free will, dressed in\r\ntheir own town or village clothing. Some of the women were carrying\r\nbabies wrapped in the fronts of their grey cloaks.\r\n\r\nWith the women came the children, boys and girls, who, like colts in a\r\nherd of horses, pressed in among the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe men took their places silently, only coughing now and then, or\r\nmaking short remarks.\r\n\r\nThe women talked without intermission. Nekhludoff thought he saw Maslova\r\nas they were coming out, but she was at once lost in the large crowd,\r\nand he could only see grey creatures, seemingly devoid of all that was\r\nhuman, or at any rate of all that was womanly, with sacks on their backs\r\nand children round them, taking their places behind the men.\r\n\r\nThough all the prisoners had been counted inside the prison walls, the\r\nconvoy counted them again, comparing the numbers with the list. This\r\ntook very long, especially as some of the prisoners moved and changed\r\nplaces, which confused the convoy.\r\n\r\nThe convoy soldiers shouted and pushed the prisoners (who complied\r\nobediently, but angrily) and counted them over again. When all had\r\nbeen counted, the convoy officer gave a command, and the crowd became\r\nagitated. The weak men and women and children rushed, racing each\r\nother, towards the carts, and began placing their bags on the carts\r\nand climbing up themselves. Women with crying babies, merry children\r\nquarrelling for places, and dull, careworn prisoners got into the carts.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the prisoners took off their caps and came up to the convoy\r\nofficer with some request. Nekhludoff found out later that they were\r\nasking for places on the carts. Nekhludoff saw how the officer, without\r\nlooking at the prisoners, drew in a whiff from his cigarette, and then\r\nsuddenly waved his short arm in front of one of the prisoners, who\r\nquickly drew his shaved head back between his shoulders as if afraid of\r\na blow, and sprang back.\r\n\r\n"I will give you a lift such that you\'ll remember. You\'ll get there on\r\nfoot right enough," shouted the officer. Only one of the men was granted\r\nhis request--an old man with chains on his legs; and Nekhludoff saw the\r\nold man take off his pancake-shaped cap, and go up to the cart crossing\r\nhimself. He could not manage to get up on the cart because of the chains\r\nthat prevented his lifting his old legs, and a woman who was sitting in\r\nthe cart at last pulled him in by the arm.\r\n\r\nWhen all the sacks were in the carts, and those who were allowed to get\r\nin were seated, the officer took off his cap, wiped his forehead, his\r\nbald head and fat, red neck, and crossed himself.\r\n\r\n"March," commanded the officer. The soldiers\' guns gave a click; the\r\nprisoners took off their caps and crossed themselves, those who were\r\nseeing them off shouted something, the prisoners shouted in answer, a\r\nrow arose among the women, and the gang, surrounded by the soldiers in\r\ntheir white blouses, moved forward, raising the dust with their chained\r\nfeet. The soldiers went in front; then came the convicts condemned to\r\nhard labour, clattering with their chains; then the exiled and those\r\nexiled by the Communes, chained in couples by their wrists; then the\r\nwomen. After them, on the carts loaded with sacks, came the weak. High\r\nup on one of the carts sat a woman closely wrapped up, and she kept\r\nshrieking and sobbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nNOT MEN BUT STRANGE AND TERRIBLE CREATURES?\r\n\r\nThe procession was such a long one that the carts with the luggage and\r\nthe weak started only when those in front were already out of sight.\r\nWhen the last of the carts moved, Nekhludoff got into the trap that\r\nstood waiting for him and told the isvostchik to catch up the prisoners\r\nin front, so that he could see if he knew any of the men in the gang,\r\nand then try and find out Maslova among the women and ask her if she had\r\nreceived the things he sent.\r\n\r\nIt was very hot, and a cloud of dust that was raised by a thousand\r\ntramping feet stood all the time over the gang that was moving down\r\nthe middle of the street. The prisoners were walking quickly, and the\r\nslow-going isvostchik\'s horse was some time in catching them up. Row\r\nupon row they passed, those strange and terrible-looking creatures, none\r\nof whom Nekhludoff knew.\r\n\r\nOn they went, all dressed alike, moving a thousand feet all shod alike,\r\nswinging their free arms as if to keep up their spirits. There were so\r\nmany of them, they all looked so much alike, and they were all placed in\r\nsuch unusual, peculiar circumstances, that they seemed to Nekhludoff\r\nto be not men but some sort of strange and terrible creatures. This\r\nimpression passed when he recognised in the crowd of convicts the\r\nmurderer Federoff, and among the exiles Okhotin the wit, and another\r\ntramp who had appealed to him for assistance. Almost all the prisoners\r\nturned and looked at the trap that was passing them and at the gentleman\r\ninside. Federoff tossed his head backwards as a sign that he had\r\nrecognised Nekhludoff, Okhotin winked, but neither of them bowed,\r\nconsidering it not the thing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Nekhludoff came up to the women he saw Maslova; she was in\r\nthe second row. The first in the row was a short-legged, black-eyed,\r\nhideous woman, who had her cloak tucked up in her girdle. This was\r\nKoroshavka. The next was a pregnant woman, who dragged herself along\r\nwith difficulty. The third was Maslova; she was carrying her sack on\r\nher shoulder, and looking straight before her. Her face looked calm\r\nand determined. The fourth in the row was a young, lovely woman who was\r\nwalking along briskly, dressed in a short cloak, her kerchief tied in\r\npeasant fashion. This was Theodosia.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff got down and approached the women, meaning to ask Maslova if\r\nshe had got the things he had sent her, and how she was feeling, but the\r\nconvoy sergeant, who was walking on that side, noticed him at once, and\r\nran towards him.\r\n\r\n"You must not do that, sir. It is against the regulations to approach\r\nthe gang," shouted the sergeant as he came up.\r\n\r\nBut when he recognised Nekhludoff (every one in the prison knew\r\nNekhludoff) the sergeant raised his fingers to his cap, and, stopping\r\nin front of Nekhludoff, said: "Not now; wait till we get to the railway\r\nstation; here it is not allowed. Don\'t lag behind; march!" he shouted to\r\nthe convicts, and putting on a brisk air, he ran back to his place at a\r\ntrot, in spite of the heat and the elegant new boots on his feet.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went on to the pavement and told the isvostchik to follow\r\nhim; himself walking, so as to keep the convicts in sight. Wherever the\r\ngang passed it attracted attention mixed with horror and compassion.\r\nThose who drove past leaned out of the vehicles and followed the\r\nprisoners with their eyes. Those on foot stopped and looked with fear\r\nand surprise at the terrible sight. Some came up and gave alms to the\r\nprisoners. The alms were received by the convoy. Some, as if they were\r\nhypnotised, followed the gang, but then stopped, shook their heads, and\r\nfollowed the prisoners only with their eyes. Everywhere the people\r\ncame out of the gates and doors, and called others to come out, too,\r\nor leaned out of the windows looking, silent and immovable, at the\r\nfrightful procession. At a cross-road a fine carriage was stopped by the\r\ngang. A fat coachman, with a shiny face and two rows of buttons on his\r\nback, sat on the box; a married couple sat facing the horses, the wife,\r\na pale, thin woman, with a light-coloured bonnet on her head and a\r\nbright sunshade in her hand, the husband with a top-hat and a well-cut\r\nlight-coloured overcoat. On the seat in front sat their children--a\r\nwell-dressed little girl, with loose, fair hair, and as fresh as a\r\nflower, who also held a bright parasol, and an eight-year-old boy, with\r\na long, thin neck and sharp collarbones, a sailor hat with long ribbons\r\non his head.\r\n\r\nThe father was angrily scolding the coachman because he had not passed\r\nin front of the gang when he had a chance, and the mother frowned and\r\nhalf closed her eyes with a look of disgust, shielding herself from the\r\ndust and the sun with her silk sunshade, which she held close to her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe fat coachman frowned angrily at the unjust rebukes of his\r\nmaster--who had himself given the order to drive along that street--and\r\nwith difficulty held in the glossy, black horses, foaming under their\r\nharness and impatient to go on.\r\n\r\nThe policeman wished with all his soul to please the owner of the fine\r\nequipage by stopping the gang, yet felt that the dismal solemnity of\r\nthe procession could not be broken even for so rich a gentleman. He only\r\nraised his fingers to his cap to show his respect for riches, and looked\r\nseverely at the prisoners as if promising in any case to protect the\r\nowners of the carriage from them. So the carriage had to wait till the\r\nwhole of the procession had passed, and could only move on when the last\r\nof the carts, laden with sacks and prisoners, rattled by. The hysterical\r\nwoman who sat on one of the carts, and had grown calm, again began\r\nshrieking and sobbing when she saw the elegant carriage. Then the\r\ncoachman tightened the reins with a slight touch, and the black\r\ntrotters, their shoes ringing against the paving stones, drew the\r\ncarriage, softly swaying on its rubber tires, towards the country\r\nhouse where the husband, the wife, the girl, and the boy with the sharp\r\ncollar-bones were going to amuse themselves. Neither the father nor the\r\nmother gave the girl and boy any explanation of what they had seen, so\r\nthat the children had themselves to find out the meaning of this curious\r\nsight. The girl, taking the expression of her father\'s and mother\'s\r\nfaces into consideration, solved the problem by assuming that these\r\npeople were quite another kind of men and women than her father and\r\nmother and their acquaintances, that they were bad people, and that they\r\nhad therefore to be treated in the manner they were being treated.\r\n\r\nTherefore the girl felt nothing but fear, and was glad when she could no\r\nlonger see those people.\r\n\r\nBut the boy with the long, thin neck, who looked at the procession\r\nof prisoners without taking his eyes off them, solved the question\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nHe still knew, firmly and without any doubt, for he had it from God,\r\nthat these people were just the same kind of people as he was, and like\r\nall other people, and therefore some one had done these people some\r\nwrong, something that ought not to have been done, and he was sorry for\r\nthem, and felt no horror either of those who were shaved and chained or\r\nof those who had shaved and chained them. And so the boy\'s lips pouted\r\nmore and more, and he made greater and greater efforts not to cry,\r\nthinking it a shame to cry in such a case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE TENDER MERCIES OF THE LORD.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff kept up with the quick pace of the convicts. Though lightly\r\nclothed he felt dreadfully hot, and it was hard to breathe in the\r\nstifling, motionless, burning air filled with dust.\r\n\r\nWhen he had walked about a quarter of a mile he again got into the trap,\r\nbut it felt still hotter in the middle of the street. He tried to recall\r\nlast night\'s conversation with his brother-in-law, but the recollections\r\nno longer excited him as they had done in the morning. They were dulled\r\nby the impressions made by the starting and procession of the gang, and\r\nchiefly by the intolerable heat.\r\n\r\nOn the pavement, in the shade of some trees overhanging a fence, he saw\r\ntwo schoolboys standing over a kneeling man who sold ices. One of the\r\nboys was already sucking a pink spoon and enjoying his ices, the other\r\nwas waiting for a glass that was being filled with something yellowish.\r\n\r\n"Where could I get a drink?" Nekhludoff asked his isvostchik, feeling an\r\ninsurmountable desire for some refreshment.\r\n\r\n"There is a good eating-house close by," the isvostchik answered, and\r\nturning a corner, drove up to a door with a large signboard. The plump\r\nclerk in a Russian shirt, who stood behind the counter, and the waiters\r\nin their once white clothing who sat at the tables (there being hardly\r\nany customers) looked with curiosity at the unusual visitor and offered\r\nhim their services. Nekhludoff asked for a bottle of seltzer water and\r\nsat down some way from the window at a small table covered with a dirty\r\ncloth. Two men sat at another table with tea-things and a white bottle\r\nin front of them, mopping their foreheads, and calculating something in\r\na friendly manner. One of them was dark and bald, and had just such a\r\nborder of hair at the back as Rogozhinsky. This sight again reminded\r\nNekhludoff of yesterday\'s talk with his brother-in-law and his wish to\r\nsee him and Nathalie.\r\n\r\n"I shall hardly be able to do it before the train starts," he thought;\r\n"I\'d better write." He asked for paper, an envelope, and a stamp, and as\r\nhe was sipping the cool, effervescent water he considered what he should\r\nsay. But his thoughts wandered, and he could not manage to compose a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n"My dear Nathalie,--I cannot go away with the heavy impression that\r\nyesterday\'s talk with your husband has left," he began. "What next?\r\nShall I ask him to forgive me what I said yesterday? But I only said\r\nwhat I felt, and he will think that I am taking it back. Besides, this\r\ninterference of his in my private matters. . . . No, I cannot," and\r\nagain he felt hatred rising in his heart towards that man so foreign\r\nto him. He folded the unfinished letter and put it in his pocket, paid,\r\nwent out, and again got into the trap to catch up the gang. It had grown\r\nstill hotter. The stones and the walls seemed to be breathing out hot\r\nair. The pavement seemed to scorch the feet, and Nekhludoff felt a\r\nburning sensation in his hand when he touched the lacquered splashguard\r\nof his trap.\r\n\r\nThe horse was jogging along at a weary trot, beating the uneven, dusty\r\nroad monotonously with its hoofs, the isvostchik kept falling into a\r\ndoze, Nekhludoff sat without thinking of anything.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of a street, in front of a large house, a group of people\r\nhad collected, and a convoy soldier stood by.\r\n\r\n"What has happened?" Nekhludoff asked of a porter.\r\n\r\n"Something the matter with a convict."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff got down and came up to the group. On the rough stones,\r\nwhere the pavement slanted down to the gutter, lay a broadly-built,\r\nred-bearded, elderly convict, with his head lower than his feet, and\r\nvery red in the face. He had a grey cloak and grey trousers on, and lay\r\non his back with the palms of his freckled hands downwards, and at\r\nlong intervals his broad, high chest heaved, and he groaned, while\r\nhis bloodshot eyes were fixed on the sky. By him stood a cross-looking\r\npoliceman, a pedlar, a postman, a clerk, an old woman with a parasol,\r\nand a short-haired boy with an empty basket.\r\n\r\n"They are weak. Having been locked up in prison they\'ve got weak, and\r\nthen they lead them through the most broiling heat," said the clerk,\r\naddressing Nekhludoff, who had just come up.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll die, most likely," said the woman with the parasol, in a doleful\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n"His shirt should be untied," said the postman.\r\n\r\nThe policeman began, with his thick, trembling fingers, clumsily to\r\nuntie the tapes that fastened the shirt round the red, sinewy neck. He\r\nwas evidently excited and confused, but still thought it necessary to\r\naddress the crowd.\r\n\r\n"What have you collected here for? It is hot enough without your keeping\r\nthe wind off."\r\n\r\n"They should have been examined by a doctor, and the weak ones left\r\nbehind," said the clerk, showing off his knowledge of the law.\r\n\r\nThe policeman, having undone the tapes of the shirt, rose and looked\r\nround.\r\n\r\n"Move on, I tell you. It is not your business, is it? What\'s there\r\nto stare at?" he said, and turned to Nekhludoff for sympathy, but not\r\nfinding any in his face he turned to the convoy soldier.\r\n\r\nBut the soldier stood aside, examining the trodden-down heel of his\r\nboot, and was quite indifferent to the policeman\'s perplexity.\r\n\r\n"Those whose business it is don\'t care. Is it right to do men to death\r\nlike this? A convict is a convict, but still he is a man," different\r\nvoices were heard saying in the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Put his head up higher, and give him some water," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Water has been sent for," said the policeman, and taking the prisoner\r\nunder the arms he with difficulty pulled his body a little higher up.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this gathering here?" said a decided, authoritative voice, and\r\na police officer, with a wonderfully clean, shiny blouse, and still more\r\nshiny top-boots, came up to the assembled crowd.\r\n\r\n"Move on. No standing about here," he shouted to the crowd, before he\r\nknew what had attracted it.\r\n\r\nWhen he came near and saw the dying convict, he made a sign of approval\r\nwith his head, just as if he had quite expected it, and, turning to the\r\npoliceman, said, "How is this?"\r\n\r\nThe policeman said that, as a gang of prisoners was passing, one of the\r\nconvicts had fallen down, and the convoy officer had ordered him to be\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s all right. He must be taken to the police station. Call an\r\nisvostchik."\r\n\r\n"A porter has gone for one," said the policeman, with his fingers raised\r\nto his cap.\r\n\r\nThe shopman began something about the heat.\r\n\r\n"Is it your business, eh? Move on," said the police officer, and looked\r\nso severely at him that the clerk was silenced.\r\n\r\n"He ought to have a little water," said Nekhludoff. The police officer\r\nlooked severely at Nekhludoff also, but said nothing. When the porter\r\nbrought a mug full of water, he told the policeman to offer some to the\r\nconvict. The policeman raised the drooping head, and tried to pour a\r\nlittle water down the mouth; but the prisoner could not swallow it, and\r\nit ran down his beard, wetting his jacket and his coarse, dirty linen\r\nshirt.\r\n\r\n"Pour it on his head," ordered the officer; and the policeman took off\r\nthe pancake-shaped cap and poured the water over the red curls and bald\r\npart of the prisoner\'s head. His eyes opened wide as if in fear, but his\r\nposition remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nStreams of dirt trickled down his dusty face, but the mouth continued to\r\ngasp in the same regular way, and his whole body shook.\r\n\r\n"And what\'s this? Take this one," said the police officer, pointing to\r\nNekhludoff\'s isvostchik. "You, there, drive up."\r\n\r\n"I am engaged," said the isvostchik, dismally, and without looking up.\r\n\r\n"It is my isvostchik; but take him. I will pay you," said Nekhludoff,\r\nturning to the isvostchik.\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you waiting for?" shouted the officer. "Catch hold."\r\n\r\nThe policeman, the porter, and the convoy soldier lifted the dying man\r\nand carried him to the trap, and put him on the seat. But he could not\r\nsit up; his head fell back, and the whole of his body glided off the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n"Make him lie down," ordered the officer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, your honour; I\'ll manage him like this," said the\r\npoliceman, sitting down by the dying man, and clasping his strong,\r\nright arm round the body under the arms. The convoy soldier lifted the\r\nstockingless feet, in prison shoes, and put them into the trap.\r\n\r\nThe police officer looked around, and noticing the pancake-shaped hat of\r\nthe convict lifted it up and put it on the wet, drooping head.\r\n\r\n"Go on," he ordered.\r\n\r\nThe isvostchik looked angrily round, shook his head, and, accompanied\r\nby the convoy soldier, drove back to the police station. The policeman,\r\nsitting beside the convict, kept dragging up the body that was\r\ncontinually sliding down from the seat, while the head swung from side\r\nto side.\r\n\r\nThe convoy soldier, who was walking by the side of the trap, kept\r\nputting the legs in their place. Nekhludoff followed the trap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nSPILLED LIKE WATER ON THE GROUND.\r\n\r\nThe trap passed the fireman who stood sentinel at the entrance, [the\r\nheadquarters of the fire brigade and the police stations are generally\r\ntogether in Moscow] drove into the yard of the police station, and\r\nstopped at one of the doors. In the yard several firemen with their\r\nsleeves tucked up were washing some kind of cart and talking loudly.\r\nWhen the trap stopped, several policemen surrounded it, and taking the\r\nlifeless body of the convict under the arms, took him out of the trap,\r\nwhich creaked under him. The policeman who had brought the body got\r\ndown, shook his numbed arm, took off his cap, and crossed himself.\r\nThe body was carried through the door and up the stairs. Nekhludoff\r\nfollowed. In the small, dirty room where the body was taken there stood\r\nfour beds. On two of them sat a couple of sick men in dressing-gowns,\r\none with a crooked mouth, whose neck was bandaged, the other one in\r\nconsumption. Two of the beds were empty; the convict was laid on one of\r\nthem. A little man, with glistening eyes and continually moving brows,\r\nwith only his underclothes and stockings on, came up with quick, soft\r\nsteps, looked at the convict and then at Nekhludoff, and burst into loud\r\nlaughter. This was a madman who was being kept in the police hospital.\r\n\r\n"They wish to frighten me, but no, they won\'t succeed," he said.\r\n\r\nThe policemen who carried the corpse were followed by a police officer\r\nand a medical assistant. The medical assistant came up to the body and\r\ntouched the freckled hand, already growing cold, which, though still\r\nsoft, was deadly pale. He held it for a moment, and then let it go. It\r\nfell lifelessly on the stomach of the dead man.\r\n\r\n"He\'s ready," said the medical assistant, but, evidently to be quite in\r\norder, he undid the wet, brown shirt, and tossing back the curls from\r\nhis ear, put it to the yellowish, broad, immovable chest of the convict.\r\nAll were silent. The medical assistant raised himself again, shook his\r\nhead, and touched with his fingers first one and then the other lid over\r\nthe open, fixed blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not frightened, I\'m not frightened." The madman kept repeating\r\nthese words, and spitting in the direction of the medical assistant.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked the police officer.\r\n\r\n"Well! He must be put into the mortuary."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure? Mind," said the police officer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s time I should know," said the medical assistant, drawing the shirt\r\nover the body\'s chest. "However, I will send for Mathew Ivanovitch. Let\r\nhim have a look. Petrov, call him," and the medical assistant stepped\r\naway from the body.\r\n\r\n"Take him to the mortuary," said the police officer. "And then you must\r\ncome into the office and sign," he added to the convoy soldier, who had\r\nnot left the convict for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said the soldier.\r\n\r\nThe policemen lifted the body and carried it down again. Nekhludoff\r\nwished to follow, but the madman kept him back.\r\n\r\n"You are not in the plot! Well, then, give me a cigarette," he said.\r\nNekhludoff got out his cigarette case and gave him one.\r\n\r\nThe madman, quickly moving his brows all the time, began relating how\r\nthey tormented him by thought suggestion.\r\n\r\n"Why, they are all against me, and torment and torture me through their\r\nmediums."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said Nekhludoff, and without listening any further\r\nhe left the room and went out into the yard, wishing to know where the\r\nbody would be put.\r\n\r\nThe policemen with their burden had already crossed the yard, and were\r\ncoming to the door of a cellar. Nekhludoff wished to go up to them, but\r\nthe police officer stopped him.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing? Then go away."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff obeyed, and went back to his isvostchik, who was dozing. He\r\nawoke him, and they drove back towards the railway station.\r\n\r\nThey had not made a hundred steps when they met a cart accompanied by\r\na convoy soldier with a gun. On the cart lay another convict, who was\r\nalready dead. The convict lay on his back in the cart, his shaved head,\r\nfrom which the pancake-shaped cap had slid over the black-bearded face\r\ndown to the nose, shaking and thumping at every jolt. The driver, in\r\nhis heavy boots, walked by the side of the cart, holding the reins;\r\na policeman followed on foot. Nekhludoff touched his isvostchik\'s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Just look what they are doing," said the isvostchik, stopping his\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff got down and, following the cart, again passed the sentinel\r\nand entered the gate of the police station. By this time the firemen had\r\nfinished washing the cart, and a tall, bony man, the chief of the fire\r\nbrigade, with a coloured band round his cap, stood in their place, and,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, was severely looking at a fat-necked,\r\nwell-fed, bay stallion that was being led up and down before him by a\r\nfireman. The stallion was lame on one of his fore feet, and the chief of\r\nthe firemen was angrily saying something to a veterinary who stood by.\r\n\r\nThe police officer was also present. When he saw the cart he went up to\r\nthe convoy soldier.\r\n\r\n"Where did you bring him from?" he asked, shaking his head\r\ndisapprovingly.\r\n\r\n"From the Gorbatovskaya," answered the policeman.\r\n\r\n"A prisoner?" asked the chief of the fire brigade.\r\n\r\n"Yes. It\'s the second to-day."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must say they\'ve got some queer arrangements. Though of course\r\nit\'s a broiling day," said the chief of the fire brigade; then, turning\r\nto the fireman who was leading the lame stallion, he shouted: "Put him\r\ninto the corner stall. And as to you, you hound, I\'ll teach you how to\r\ncripple horses which are worth more than you are, you scoundrel."\r\n\r\nThe dead man was taken from the cart by the policemen just in the same\r\nway as the first had been, and carried upstairs into the hospital.\r\nNekhludoff followed them as if he were hypnotised.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" asked one of the policemen. But Nekhludoff did\r\nnot answer, and followed where the body was being carried. The madman,\r\nsitting on a bed, was smoking greedily the cigarette Nekhludoff had\r\ngiven him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'ve come back," he said, and laughed. When he saw the body he\r\nmade a face, and said, "Again! I am sick of it. I am not a boy, am I,\r\neh?" and he turned to Nekhludoff with a questioning smile.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was looking at the dead man, whose face, which had been\r\nhidden by his cap, was now visible. This convict was as handsome in face\r\nand body as the other was hideous. He was a man in the full bloom of\r\nlife. Notwithstanding that he was disfigured by the half of his head\r\nbeing shaved, the straight, rather low forehead, raised a bit over the\r\nblack, lifeless eyes, was very fine, and so was the nose above the\r\nthin, black moustaches. There was a smile on the lips that were already\r\ngrowing blue, a small beard outlined the lower part of the face, and on\r\nthe shaved side of the head a firm, well-shaped ear was visible.\r\n\r\nOne could see what possibilities of a higher life had been destroyed\r\nin this man. The fine bones of his hands and shackled feet, the strong\r\nmuscles of all his well-proportioned limbs, showed what a beautiful,\r\nstrong, agile human animal this had been. As an animal merely he had\r\nbeen a far more perfect one of his kind than the bay stallion, about the\r\nlaming of which the fireman was so angry.\r\n\r\nYet he had been done to death, and no one was sorry for him as a man,\r\nnor was any one sorry that so fine a working animal had perished. The\r\nonly feeling evinced was that of annoyance because of the bother caused\r\nby the necessity of getting this body, threatening putrefaction, out of\r\nthe way. The doctor and his assistant entered the hospital, accompanied\r\nby the inspector of the police station. The doctor was a thick-set man,\r\ndressed in pongee silk coat and trousers of the same material, closely\r\nfitting his muscular thighs. The inspector was a little fat fellow, with\r\na red face, round as a ball, which he made still broader by a habit he\r\nhad of filling his cheeks with air, and slowly letting it out again. The\r\ndoctor sat down on the bed by the side of the dead man, and touched\r\nthe hands in the same way as his assistant had done, put his ear to the\r\nheart, rose, and pulled his trousers straight. "Could not be more dead,"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nThe inspector filled his mouth with air and slowly blew it out again.\r\n\r\n"Which prison is he from?" he asked the convoy soldier.\r\n\r\nThe soldier told him, and reminded him of the chains on the dead man\'s\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have them taken off; we have got a smith about, the Lord be\r\nthanked," said the inspector, and blew up his cheeks again; he went\r\ntowards the door, slowly letting out the air.\r\n\r\n"Why has this happened?" Nekhludoff asked the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at him through his spectacles.\r\n\r\n"Why has what happened? Why they die of sunstroke, you mean? This is\r\nwhy: They sit all through the winter without exercise and without light,\r\nand suddenly they are taken out into the sunshine, and on a day like\r\nthis, and they march in a crowd so that they get no air, and sunstroke\r\nis the result."\r\n\r\n"Then why are they sent out?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as to that, go and ask those who send them. But may I ask who are\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I am a stranger."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, good-afternoon; I have no time." The doctor was vexed; he\r\ngave his trousers a downward pull, and went towards the beds of the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n"Well, how are you getting on?" he asked the pale man with the crooked\r\nmouth and bandaged neck.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the madman sat on a bed, and having finished his cigarette,\r\nkept spitting in the direction of the doctor.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff went down into the yard and out of the gate past the\r\nfiremen\'s horses and the hens and the sentinel in his brass helmet, and\r\ngot into the trap, the driver of which had again fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONVICT TRAIN.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff came to the station, the prisoners were all seated in\r\nrailway carriages with grated windows. Several persons, come to see\r\nthem off, stood on the platform, but were not allowed to come up to the\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nThe convoy was much troubled that day. On the way from the prison to the\r\nstation, besides the two Nekhludoff had seen, three other prisoners\r\nhad fallen and died of sunstroke. One was taken to the nearest police\r\nstation like the first two, and the other two died at the railway\r\nstation. [In Moscow, in the beginning of the eighth decade of this\r\ncentury, five convicts died of sunstroke in one day on their way from\r\nthe Boutyrki prison to the Nijni railway station.] The convoy men were\r\nnot troubled because five men who might have been alive died while in\r\ntheir charge. This did not trouble them, but they were concerned lest\r\nanything that the law required in such cases should be omitted. To\r\nconvey the bodies to the places appointed, to deliver up their papers,\r\nto take them off the lists of those to be conveyed to Nijni--all this\r\nwas very troublesome, especially on so hot a day.\r\n\r\nIt was this that occupied the convoy men, and before it could all be\r\naccomplished Nekhludoff and the others who asked for leave to go up to\r\nthe carriages were not allowed to do so. Nekhludoff, however, was soon\r\nallowed to go up, because he tipped the convoy sergeant. The sergeant\r\nlet Nekhludoff pass, but asked him to be quick and get his talk over\r\nbefore any of the authorities noticed. There were 15 carriages in all,\r\nand except one carriage for the officials, they were full of prisoners.\r\nAs Nekhludoff passed the carriages he listened to what was going on in\r\nthem. In all the carriages was heard the clanging of chains, the sound\r\nof bustle, mixed with loud and senseless language, but not a word was\r\nbeing said about their dead fellow-prisoners. The talk was all about\r\nsacks, drinking water, and the choice of seats.\r\n\r\nLooking into one of the carriages, Nekhludoff saw convoy soldiers taking\r\nthe manacles off the hands of the prisoners. The prisoners held out\r\ntheir arms, and one of the soldiers unlocked the manacles with a key and\r\ntook them off; the other collected them.\r\n\r\nAfter he had passed all the other carriages, Nekhludoff came up to the\r\nwomen\'s carriages. From the second of these he heard a woman\'s groans:\r\n"Oh, oh, oh! O God! Oh, oh! O God!"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff passed this carriage and went up to a window of the third\r\ncarriage, which a soldier pointed out to him. When he approached his\r\nface to the window, he felt the hot air, filled with the smell of\r\nperspiration, coming out of it, and heard distinctly the shrill sound\r\nof women\'s voices. All the seats were filled with red, perspiring,\r\nloudly-talking women, dressed in prison cloaks and white jackets.\r\nNekhludoff\'s face at the window attracted their attention. Those nearest\r\nceased talking and drew closer. Maslova, in her white jacket and her\r\nhead uncovered, sat by the opposite window. The white-skinned, smiling\r\nTheodosia sat a little nearer. When she recognised Nekhludoff, she\r\nnudged Maslova and pointed to the window. Maslova rose hurriedly, threw\r\nher kerchief over her black hair, and with a smile on her hot, red face\r\ncame up to the window and took hold of one of the bars.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is hot," she said, with a glad smile.\r\n\r\n"Did you get the things?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you."\r\n\r\n"Is there anything more you want?" asked Nekhludoff, while the air came\r\nout of the hot carriage as out of an oven.\r\n\r\n"I want nothing, thank you."\r\n\r\n"If we could get a drink?" said Theodosia.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if we could get a drink," repeated Maslova.\r\n\r\n"Why, have you not got any water?"\r\n\r\n"They put some in, but it is all gone."\r\n\r\n"Directly, I will ask one of the convoy men. Now we shall not see each\r\nother till we get to Nijni."\r\n\r\n"Why? Are you going?" said Maslova, as if she did not know it, and\r\nlooked joyfully at Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"I am going by the next train."\r\n\r\nMaslova said nothing, but only sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n"Is it true, sir, that 12 convicts have been done to death?" said a\r\nsevere-looking old prisoner with a deep voice like a man\'s.\r\n\r\nIt was Korableva.\r\n\r\n"I did not hear of 12; I have seen two," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"They say there were 12 they killed. And will nothing be done to them?\r\nOnly think! The fiends!"\r\n\r\n"And have none of the women fallen ill?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"Women are stronger," said another of the prisoners--a short little\r\nwoman, and laughed; "only there\'s one that has taken it into her head to\r\nbe delivered. There she goes," she said, pointing to the next carriage,\r\nwhence proceeded the groans.\r\n\r\n"You ask if we want anything," said Maslova, trying to keep the smile\r\nof joy from her lips; "could not this woman be left behind, suffering as\r\nshe is? There, now, if you would tell the authorities."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will."\r\n\r\n"And one thing more; could she not see her husband, Taras?" she added,\r\npointing with her eyes to the smiling Theodosia.\r\n\r\n"He is going with you, is he not?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, you must not talk," said a convoy sergeant, not the one who had\r\nlet Nekhludoff come up. Nekhludoff left the carriage and went in search\r\nof an official to whom he might speak for the woman in travail and about\r\nTaras, but could not find him, nor get an answer from any of the convoy\r\nfor a long time. They were all in a bustle; some were leading a prisoner\r\nsomewhere or other, others running to get themselves provisions, some\r\nwere placing their things in the carriages or attending on a lady\r\nwho was going to accompany the convoy officer, and they answered\r\nNekhludoff\'s questions unwillingly. Nekhludoff found the convoy officer\r\nonly after the second bell had been rung. The officer with his short\r\narm was wiping the moustaches that covered his mouth and shrugging his\r\nshoulders, reproving the corporal for something or other.\r\n\r\n"What is it you want?" he asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a woman there who is being confined, so I thought best--"\r\n\r\n"Well, let her be confined; we shall see later on," and briskly swinging\r\nhis short arms, he ran up to his carriage. At the moment the guard\r\npassed with a whistle in his hand, and from the people on the platform\r\nand from the women\'s carriages there arose a sound of weeping and words\r\nof prayer.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stood on the platform by the side of Taras, and looked how,\r\none after the other, the carriages glided past him, with the shaved\r\nheads of the men at the grated windows. Then the first of the women\'s\r\ncarriages came up, with women\'s heads at the windows, some covered with\r\nkerchiefs and some uncovered, then the second, whence proceeded the same\r\ngroans, then the carriage where Maslova was. She stood with the others\r\nat the window, and looked at Nekhludoff with a pathetic smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nBROTHER AND SISTER.\r\n\r\nThere were still two hours before the passenger train by which\r\nNekhludoff was going would start. He had thought of using this interval\r\nto see his sister again; but after the impressions of the morning he\r\nfelt much excited and so done up that, sitting down on a sofa in the\r\nfirst-class refreshment-room, he suddenly grew so drowsy that he turned\r\nover on to his side, and, laying his face on his hand, fell asleep at\r\nonce. A waiter in a dress coat with a napkin in his hand woke him.\r\n\r\n"Sir, sir, are you not Prince Nekhludoff? There\'s a lady looking for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff started up and recollected where he was and all that had\r\nhappened in the morning.\r\n\r\nHe saw in his imagination the procession of prisoners, the dead bodies,\r\nthe railway carriages with barred windows, and the women locked up in\r\nthem, one of whom was groaning in travail with no one to help her, and\r\nanother who was pathetically smiling at him through the bars.\r\n\r\nThe reality before his eyes was very different, i.e., a table with\r\nvases, candlesticks and crockery, and agile waiters moving round the\r\ntable, and in the background a cupboard and a counter laden with fruit\r\nand bottles, behind it a barman, and in front the backs of passengers\r\nwho had come up for refreshments. When Nekhludoff had risen and sat\r\ngradually collecting his thoughts, he noticed that everybody in the\r\nroom was inquisitively looking at something that was passing by the open\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nHe also looked, and saw a group of people carrying a chair on which sat\r\na lady whose head was wrapped in a kind of airy fabric.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thought he knew the footman who was supporting the chair in\r\nfront. And also the man behind, and a doorkeeper with gold cord on his\r\ncap, seemed familiar. A lady\'s maid with a fringe and an apron, who was\r\ncarrying a parcel, a parasol, and something round in a leather case,\r\nwas walking behind the chair. Then came Prince Korchagin, with his thick\r\nlips, apoplectic neck, and a travelling cap on his head; behind him\r\nMissy, her cousin Misha, and an acquaintance of Nekhludoff\'s--the\r\nlong-necked diplomat Osten, with his protruding Adam\'s apple and his\r\nunvarying merry mood and expression. He was saying something very\r\nemphatically, though jokingly, to the smiling Missy. The Korchagins were\r\nmoving from their estate near the city to the estate of the Princess\'s\r\nsister on the Nijni railway. The procession--the men carrying the\r\nchair, the maid, and the doctor--vanished into the ladies\' waiting-room,\r\nevoking a feeling of curiosity and respect in the onlookers. But the old\r\nPrince remained and sat down at the table, called a waiter, and ordered\r\nfood and drink. Missy and Osten also remained in the refreshment-room\r\nand were about to sit down, when they saw an acquaintance in the\r\ndoorway, and went up to her. It was Nathalie Rogozhinsky. Nathalie came\r\ninto the refreshment-room accompanied by Agraphena Petrovna, and both\r\nlooked round the room. Nathalie noticed at one and the same moment both\r\nher brother and Missy. She first went up to Missy, only nodding to her\r\nbrother; but, having kissed her, at once turned to him.\r\n\r\n"At last I have found you," she said. Nekhludoff rose to greet Missy,\r\nMisha, and Osten, and to say a few words to them. Missy told him about\r\ntheir house in the country having been burnt down, which necessitated\r\ntheir moving to her aunt\'s. Osten began relating a funny story about a\r\nfire. Nekhludoff paid no attention, and turned to his sister.\r\n\r\n"How glad I am that you have come."\r\n\r\n"I have been here a long time," she said. "Agraphena Petrovna is with\r\nme." And she pointed to Agraphena Petrovna, who, in a waterproof and\r\nwith a bonnet on her head, stood some way off, and bowed to him with\r\nkindly dignity and some confusion, not wishing to intrude.\r\n\r\n"We looked for you everywhere."\r\n\r\n"And I had fallen asleep here. How glad I am that you have come,"\r\nrepeated Nekhludoff. "I had begun to write to you."\r\n\r\n"Really?" she said, looking frightened. "What about?"\r\n\r\nMissy and the gentleman, noticing that an intimate conversation was\r\nabout to commence between the brother and sister, went away. Nekhludoff\r\nand his sister sat down by the window on a velvet-covered sofa, on which\r\nlay a plaid, a box, and a few other things.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday, after I left you, I felt inclined to return and express my\r\nregret, but I did not know how he would take it," said Nekhludoff. "I\r\nspoke hastily to your husband, and this tormented me."\r\n\r\n"I knew," said his sister, "that you did not mean to. Oh, you know!" and\r\nthe tears came to her eyes, and she touched his hand. The sentence was\r\nnot clear, but he understood it perfectly, and was touched by what it\r\nexpressed. Her words meant that, besides the love for her husband which\r\nheld her in its sway, she prized and considered important the love she\r\nhad for him, her brother, and that every misunderstanding between them\r\ncaused her deep suffering.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you. Oh! what I have seen to-day!" he said, suddenly\r\nrecalling the second of the dead convicts. "Two prisoners have been done\r\nto death."\r\n\r\n"Done to death? How?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, done to death. They led them in this heat, and two died of\r\nsunstroke."\r\n\r\n"Impossible! What, to-day? just now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, just now. I have seen their bodies."\r\n\r\n"But why done to death? Who killed them?" asked Nathalie.\r\n\r\n"They who forced them to go killed them," said Nekhludoff, with\r\nirritation, feeling that she looked at this, too, with her husband\'s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lord!" said Agraphena Petrovna, who had come up to them.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have not the slightest idea of what is being done to these\r\nunfortunate beings. But it ought to be known," added Nekhludoff, and\r\nlooked at old Korchagin, who sat with a napkin tied round him and a\r\nbottle before him, and who looked round at Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Nekhludoff," he called out, "won\'t you join me and take some\r\nrefreshment? It is excellent before a journey."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff refused, and turned away.\r\n\r\n"But what are you going to do?" Nathalie continued.\r\n\r\n"What I can. I don\'t know, but I feel I must do something. And I shall\r\ndo what I am able to."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I understand. And how about them?" she continued, with a smile and\r\na look towards Korchagin. "Is it possible that it is all over?"\r\n\r\n"Completely, and I think without any regret on either side."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity. I am sorry. I am fond of her. However, it\'s all right.\r\nBut why do you wish to bind yourself?" she added shyly. "Why are you\r\ngoing?"\r\n\r\n"I go because I must," answered Nekhludoff, seriously and dryly, as if\r\nwishing to stop this conversation. But he felt ashamed of his coldness\r\ntowards his sister at once. "Why not tell her all I am thinking?" he\r\nthought, "and let Agraphena Petrovna also hear it," he thought, with\r\na look at the old servant, whose presence made the wish to repeat his\r\ndecision to his sister even stronger.\r\n\r\n"You mean my intention to marry Katusha? Well, you see, I made up my\r\nmind to do it, but she refuses definitely and firmly," he said, and his\r\nvoice shook, as it always did when he spoke of it. "She does not wish\r\nto accept my sacrifice, but is herself sacrificing what in her position\r\nmeans much, and I cannot accept this sacrifice, if it is only a\r\nmomentary impulse. And so I am going with her, and shall be where she\r\nis, and shall try to lighten her fate as much as I can."\r\n\r\nNathalie said nothing. Agraphena Petrovna looked at her with a\r\nquestioning look, and shook her head. At this moment the former\r\nprocession issued from the ladies\' room. The same handsome footman\r\n(Philip). and the doorkeeper were carrying the Princess Korchagin. She\r\nstopped the men who were carrying her, and motioned to Nekhludoff to\r\napproach, and, with a pitiful, languishing air, she extended her white,\r\nringed hand, expecting the firm pressure of his hand with a sense of\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\n"Epouvantable!" she said, meaning the heat. "I cannot stand it! Ce\r\nclimat me tue!" And, after a short talk about the horrors of the Russian\r\nclimate, she gave the men a sign to go on.\r\n\r\n"Be sure and come," she added, turning her long face towards Nekhludoff\r\nas she was borne away.\r\n\r\nThe procession with the Princess turned to the right towards the\r\nfirst-class carriages. Nekhludoff, with the porter who was carrying his\r\nthings, and Taras with his bag, turned to the left.\r\n\r\n"This is my companion," said Nekhludoff to his sister, pointing to\r\nTaras, whose story he had told her before.\r\n\r\n"Surely not third class?" said Nathalie, when Nekhludoff stopped in\r\nfront of a third-class carriage, and Taras and the porter with the\r\nthings went in.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is more convenient for me to be with Taras," he said. "One\r\nthing more," he added; "up to now I have not given the Kousminski\r\nland to the peasants; so that, in case of my death, your children will\r\ninherit it."\r\n\r\n"Dmitri, don\'t!" said Nathalie.\r\n\r\n"If I do give it away, all I can say is that the rest will be theirs,\r\nas it is not likely I shall marry; and if I do marry I shall have no\r\nchildren, so that--"\r\n\r\n"Dmitri, don\'t talk like that!" said Nathalie. And yet Nekhludoff\r\nnoticed that she was glad to hear him say it.\r\n\r\nHigher up, by the side of a first-class carriage, there stood a group of\r\npeople still looking at the carriage into which the Princess Korchagin\r\nhad been carried. Most of the passengers were already seated. Some of\r\nthe late comers hurriedly clattered along the boards of the platform,\r\nthe guard was closing the doors and asking the passengers to get in and\r\nthose who were seeing them off to come out.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff entered the hot, smelling carriage, but at once stepped out\r\nagain on to the small platform at the back of the carriage. Nathalie\r\nstood opposite the carriage, with her fashionable bonnet and cape,\r\nby the side of Agraphena Petrovna, and was evidently trying to find\r\nsomething to say.\r\n\r\nShe could not even say ecrivez, because they had long ago laughed\r\nat this word, habitually spoken by those about to part. The short\r\nconversation about money matters had in a moment destroyed the tender\r\nbrotherly and sisterly feelings that had taken hold of them. They felt\r\nestranged, so that Nathalie was glad when the train moved; and she\r\ncould only say, nodding her head with a sad and tender look, "Goodbye,\r\ngood-bye, Dmitri." But as soon as the carriage had passed her she\r\nthought of how she should repeat her conversation with her brother to\r\nher husband, and her face became serious and troubled.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff, too, though he had nothing but the kindest feelings for\r\nhis sister, and had hidden nothing from her, now felt depressed and\r\nuncomfortable with her, and was glad to part. He felt that the Nathalie\r\nwho was once so near to him no longer existed, and in her place was only\r\na slave of that hairy, unpleasant husband, who was so foreign to him. He\r\nsaw it clearly when her face lit up with peculiar animation as he spoke\r\nof what would peculiarly interest her husband, i.e., the giving up of\r\nthe land to the peasants and the inheritance.\r\n\r\nAnd this made him sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF HUMAN LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe heat in the large third-class carriage, which had been standing in\r\nthe burning sun all day, was so great that Nekhludoff did not go in,\r\nbut stopped on the little platform behind the carriage which formed a\r\npassage to the next one. But there was not a breath of fresh air here\r\neither, and Nekhludoff breathed freely only when the train had passed\r\nthe buildings and the draught blew across the platform.\r\n\r\n"Yes, killed," he repeated to himself, the words he had used to his\r\nsister. And in his imagination in the midst of all other impressions\r\nthere arose with wonderful clearness the beautiful face of the second\r\ndead convict, with the smile of the lips, the severe expression of the\r\nbrows, and the small, firm ear below the shaved bluish skull.\r\n\r\nAnd what seemed terrible was that he had been murdered, and no one knew\r\nwho had murdered him. Yet he had been murdered. He was led out like all\r\nthe rest of the prisoners by Maslennikoff\'s orders. Maslennikoff had\r\nprobably given the order in the usual manner, had signed with his stupid\r\nflourish the paper with the printed heading, and most certainly would\r\nnot consider himself guilty. Still less would the careful doctor who\r\nexamined the convicts consider himself guilty. He had performed his duty\r\naccurately, and had separated the weak. How could he have foreseen this\r\nterrible heat, or the fact that they would start so late in the day and\r\nin such crowds? The prison inspector? But the inspector had only carried\r\ninto execution the order that on a given day a certain number of exiles\r\nand convicts--men and women--had to be sent off. The convoy officer\r\ncould not be guilty either, for his business was to receive a certain\r\nnumber of persons in a certain place, and to deliver up the same number.\r\nHe conducted them in the usual manner, and could not foresee that two\r\nsuch strong men as those Nekhludoff saw would not be able to stand it\r\nand would die. No one is guilty, and yet the men have been murdered by\r\nthese people who are not guilty of their murder.\r\n\r\n"All this comes," Nekhludoff thought, "from the fact that all these\r\npeople, governors, inspectors, police officers, and men, consider that\r\nthere are circumstances in which human relations are not necessary\r\nbetween human beings. All these men, Maslennikoff, and the inspector,\r\nand the convoy officer, if they were not _governor, inspector, officer,_\r\nwould have considered twenty times before sending people in such heat\r\nin such a mass--would have stopped twenty times on the way, and, seeing\r\nthat a man was growing weak, gasping for breath, would have led him\r\ninto the shade, would have given him water and let him rest, and if an\r\naccident had still occurred they would have expressed pity. But they\r\nnot only did not do it, but hindered others from doing it, because they\r\nconsidered not men and their duty towards them but only the office they\r\nthemselves filled, and held what that office demanded of them to be\r\nabove human relations. That\'s what it is," Nekhludoff went on in his\r\nthoughts. "If one acknowledges but for a single hour that anything\r\ncan be more important than love for one\'s fellowmen, even in some\r\none exceptional case, any crime can be committed without a feeling of\r\nguilt."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was so engrossed by his thoughts that he did not notice how\r\nthe weather changed. The sun was covered over by a low-hanging, ragged\r\ncloud. A compact, light grey cloud was rapidly coming from the west, and\r\nwas already falling in heavy, driving rain on the fields and woods far\r\nin the distance. Moisture, coming from the cloud, mixed with the air.\r\nNow and then the cloud was rent by flashes of lightning, and peals of\r\nthunder mingled more and more often with the rattling of the train. The\r\ncloud came nearer and nearer, the rain-drops driven by the wind began\r\nto spot the platform and Nekhludoff\'s coat; and he stepped to the other\r\nside of the little platform, and, inhaling the fresh, moist air--filled\r\nwith the smell of corn and wet earth that had long been waiting for\r\nrain--he stood looking at the gardens, the woods, the yellow rye fields,\r\nthe green oatfields, the dark-green strips of potatoes in bloom, that\r\nglided past. Everything looked as if covered over with varnish--the\r\ngreen turned greener, the yellow yellower, the black blacker.\r\n\r\n"More! more!" said Nekhludoff, gladdened by the sight of gardens and\r\nfields revived by the beneficent shower. The shower did not last long.\r\nPart of the cloud had come down in rain, part passed over, and the last\r\nfine drops fell straight on to the earth. The sun reappeared,\r\neverything began to glisten, and in the east--not very high above the\r\nhorizon--appeared a bright rainbow, with the violet tint very distinct\r\nand broken only at one end.\r\n\r\n"Why, what was I thinking about?" Nekhludoff asked himself when all\r\nthese changes in nature were over, and the train ran into a cutting\r\nbetween two high banks.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I was thinking that all those people (inspector, convoy men--all\r\nthose in the service) are for the greater part kind people--cruel only\r\nbecause they are serving." He recalled Maslennikoff\'s indifference when\r\nhe told him about what was being done in the prison, the inspector\'s\r\nseverity, the cruelty of the convoy officer when he refused places on\r\nthe carts to those who asked for them, and paid no attention to the fact\r\nthat there was a woman in travail in the train. All these people were\r\nevidently invulnerable and impregnable to the simplest feelings of\r\ncompassion only because they held offices. "As officials they were\r\nimpermeable to the feelings of humanity, as this paved ground is\r\nimpermeable to the rain." Thus thought Nekhludoff as he looked at the\r\nrailway embankment paved with stones of different colours, down which\r\nthe water was running in streams instead of soaking into the earth.\r\n"Perhaps it is necessary to pave the banks with stones, but it is sad\r\nto look at the ground, which might be yielding corn, grass, bushes, or\r\ntrees in the same way as the ground visible up there is doing--deprived\r\nof vegetation, and so it is with men," thought Nekhludoff. "Perhaps\r\nthese governors, inspectors, policemen, are needed, but it is terrible\r\nto see men deprived of the chief human attribute, that of love and\r\nsympathy for one another. The thing is," he continued, "that these\r\npeople consider lawful what is not lawful, and do not consider the\r\neternal, immutable law, written in the hearts of men by God, as law.\r\nThat is why I feel so depressed when I am with these people. I am\r\nsimply afraid of them, and really they are terrible, more terrible than\r\nrobbers. A robber might, after all, feel pity, but they can feel\r\nno pity, they are inured against pity as these stones are against\r\nvegetation. That is what makes them terrible. It is said that the\r\nPougatcheffs, the Razins [leaders of rebellions in Russia: Stonka Razin\r\nin the 17th and Pougatcheff in the 18th century] are terrible. These are\r\na thousand times more terrible," he continued, in his thoughts. "If\r\na psychological problem were set to find means of making men of our\r\ntime--Christian, humane, simple, kind people--perform the most horrible\r\ncrimes without feeling guilty, only one solution could be devised: to\r\ngo on doing what is being done. It is only necessary that these people\r\nshould he governors, inspectors, policemen; that they should be fully\r\nconvinced that there is a kind of business, called government service,\r\nwhich allows men to treat other men as things, without human brotherly\r\nrelations with them, and also that these people should be so linked\r\ntogether by this government service that the responsibility for the\r\nresults of their actions should not fall on any one of them separately.\r\nWithout these conditions, the terrible acts I witnessed to-day would be\r\nimpossible in our times. It all lies in the fact that men think there\r\nare circumstances in which one may deal with human beings without love;\r\nand there are no such circumstances. One may deal with things without\r\nlove. One may cut down trees, make bricks, hammer iron without love; but\r\nyou cannot deal with men without it, just as one cannot deal with bees\r\nwithout being careful. If you deal carelessly with bees you will injure\r\nthem, and will yourself be injured. And so with men. It cannot be\r\notherwise, because natural love is the fundamental law of human life. It\r\nis true that a man cannot force another to love him, as he can force\r\nhim to work for him; but it does not follow that a man may deal with men\r\nwithout love, especially to demand anything from them. If you feel no\r\nlove, sit still," Nekhludoff thought; "occupy yourself with things, with\r\nyourself, with anything you like, only not with men. You can only eat\r\nwithout injuring yourself when you feel inclined to eat, so you can only\r\ndeal with men usefully when you love. Only let yourself deal with a man\r\nwithout love, as I did yesterday with my brother-in-law, and there are\r\nno limits to the suffering you will bring on yourself, as all my life\r\nproves. Yes, yes, it is so," thought Nekhludoff; "it is good; yes, it is\r\ngood," he repeated, enjoying the freshness after the torturing heat, and\r\nconscious of having attained to the fullest clearness on a question that\r\nhad long occupied him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTARAS\'S STORY.\r\n\r\nThe carriage in which Nekhludoff had taken his place was half filled\r\nwith people. There were in it servants, working men, factory hands,\r\nbutchers, Jews, shopmen, workmen\'s wives, a soldier, two ladies, a\r\nyoung one and an old one with bracelets on her arm, and a severe-looking\r\ngentleman with a cockade on his black cap. All these people were sitting\r\nquietly; the bustle of taking their places was long over; some sat\r\ncracking and eating sunflower seeds, some smoking, some talking.\r\n\r\nTaras sat, looking very happy, opposite the door, keeping a place for\r\nNekhludoff, and carrying on an animated conversation with a man in\r\na cloth coat who sat opposite to him, and who was, as Nekhludoff\r\nafterwards found out, a gardener going to a new situation. Before\r\nreaching the place where Taras sat Nekhludoff stopped between the seats\r\nnear a reverend-looking old man with a white beard and nankeen coat, who\r\nwas talking with a young woman in peasant dress. A little girl of about\r\nseven, dressed in a new peasant costume, sat, her little legs dangling\r\nabove the floor, by the side of the woman, and kept cracking seeds.\r\n\r\nThe old man turned round, and, seeing Nekhludoff, he moved the lappets\r\nof his coat off the varnished seat next to him, and said, in a friendly\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n"Please, here\'s a seat."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thanked him, and took the seat. As soon as he was seated the\r\nwoman continued the interrupted conversation.\r\n\r\nShe was returning to her village, and related how her husband, whom she\r\nhad been visiting, had received her in town.\r\n\r\n"I was there during the carnival, and now, by the Lord\'s help, I\'ve been\r\nagain," she said. "Then, God willing, at Christmas I\'ll go again."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said the old man, with a look at Nekhludoff, "it\'s the\r\nbest way to go and see him, else a young man can easily go to the bad,\r\nliving in a town."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir, mine is not such a man. No nonsense of any kind about him;\r\nhis life is as good as a young maiden\'s. The money he earns he sends\r\nhome all to a copeck. And, as to our girl here, he was so glad to see\r\nher, there are no words for it," said the woman, and smiled.\r\n\r\nThe little girl, who sat cracking her seeds and spitting out the shells,\r\nlistened to her mother\'s words, and, as if to confirm them, looked up\r\nwith calm, intelligent eyes into Nekhludoff\'s and the old man\'s faces.\r\n\r\n"Well, if he\'s good, that\'s better still," said the old man. "And none\r\nof that sort of thing?" he added, with a look at a couple, evidently\r\nfactory hands, who sat at the other side of the carriage. The husband,\r\nwith his head thrown back, was pouring vodka down his throat out of a\r\nbottle, and the wife sat holding a bag, out of which they had taken the\r\nbottle, and watched him intently.\r\n\r\n"No, mine neither drinks nor smokes," said the woman who was conversing\r\nwith the old man, glad of the opportunity of praising her husband once\r\nmore. "No, sir, the earth does not hold many such." And, turning to\r\nNekhludoff, she added, "That\'s the sort of man he is."\r\n\r\n"What could be better," said the old man, looking at the factory worker,\r\nwho had had his drink and had passed the bottle to his wife. The wife\r\nlaughed, shook her head, and also raised the bottle to her lips.\r\n\r\nNoticing Nekhludoff\'s and the old man\'s look directed towards them, the\r\nfactory worker addressed the former.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir? That we are drinking? Ah, no one sees how we work,\r\nbut every one sees how we drink. I have earned it, and I am drinking and\r\ntreating my wife, and no one else."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Nekhludoff, not knowing what to say.\r\n\r\n"True, sir. My wife is a steady woman. I am satisfied with my wife,\r\nbecause she can feel for me. Is it right what I\'m saying, Mavra?"\r\n\r\n"There you are, take it, I don\'t want any more," said the wife,\r\nreturning the bottle to him. "And what are you jawing for like that?"\r\nshe added.\r\n\r\n"There now! She\'s good--that good; and suddenly she\'ll begin squeaking\r\nlike a wheel that\'s not greased. Mavra, is it right what I\'m saying?"\r\n\r\nMavra laughed and moved her hand with a tipsy gesture.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my, he\'s at it again."\r\n\r\n"There now, she\'s that good--that good; but let her get her tail over\r\nthe reins, and you can\'t think what she\'ll be up to. . . . Is it right\r\nwhat I\'m saying? You must excuse me, sir, I\'ve had a drop! What\'s to be\r\ndone?" said the factory worker, and, preparing to go to sleep, put his\r\nhead in his wife\'s lap.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat a while with the old man, who told him all about himself.\r\nThe old man was a stove builder, who had been working for 53 years, and\r\nhad built so many stoves that he had lost count, and now he wanted to\r\nrest, but had no time. He had been to town and found employment for the\r\nyoung ones, and was now going to the country to see the people at home.\r\nAfter hearing the old man\'s story, Nekhludoff went to the place that\r\nTaras was keeping for him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, sir; sit down; we\'ll put the bag here," said the\r\ngardener, who sat opposite Taras, in a friendly tone, looking up into\r\nNekhludoff\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Rather a tight fit, but no matter since we are friends," said Taras,\r\nsmiling, and lifting the bag, which weighed more than five stone, as if\r\nit were a feather, he carried it across to the window.\r\n\r\n"Plenty of room; besides, we might stand up a bit; and even under\r\nthe seat it\'s as comfortable as you could wish. What\'s the good of\r\nhumbugging?" he said, beaming with friendliness and kindness.\r\n\r\nTaras spoke of himself as being unable to utter a word when quite sober;\r\nbut drink, he said, helped him to find the right words, and then he\r\ncould express everything. And in reality, when he was sober Taras kept\r\nsilent; but when he had been drinking, which happened rarely and only on\r\nspecial occasions, he became very pleasantly talkative. Then he spoke\r\na great deal, spoke well and very simply and truthfully, and especially\r\nwith great kindliness, which shone in his gentle, blue eyes and in the\r\nfriendly smile that never left his lips. He was in such a state to-day.\r\nNekhludoff\'s approach interrupted the conversation; but when he had put\r\nthe bag in its place, Taras sat down again, and with his strong hands\r\nfolded in his lap, and looking straight into the gardener\'s face,\r\ncontinued his story. He was telling his new acquaintance about his wife\r\nand giving every detail: what she was being sent to Siberia for, and why\r\nhe was now following her. Nekhludoff had never heard a detailed account\r\nof this affair, and so he listened with interest. When he came up, the\r\nstory had reached the point when the attempt to poison was already an\r\naccomplished fact, and the family had discovered that it was Theodosia\'s\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about my troubles that I\'m talking," said Taras, addressing\r\nNekhludoff with cordial friendliness. "I have chanced to come across\r\nsuch a hearty man, and we\'ve got into conversation, and I\'m telling him\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Well, then in this way, my friend, the business became known. Mother,\r\nshe takes that cake. \'I\'m going,\' says she, \'to the police officer.\' My\r\nfather is a just old man. \'Wait, wife,\' says he, \'the little woman is\r\na mere child, and did not herself know what she was doing. We must have\r\npity. She may come to her senses.\' But, dear me, mother would not hear\r\nof it. \'While we keep her here,\' she says, \'she may destroy us all like\r\ncockroaches.\' Well, friend, so she goes off for the police officer. He\r\nbounces in upon us at once. Calls for witnesses."\r\n\r\n"Well, and you?" asked the gardener.\r\n\r\n"Well, I, you see, friend, roll about with the pain in my stomach, and\r\nvomit. All my inside is turned inside out; I can\'t even speak. Well, so\r\nfather he goes and harnesses the mare, and puts Theodosia into the cart,\r\nand is off to the police-station, and then to the magistrate\'s. And she,\r\nyou know, just as she had done from the first, so also there, confesses\r\nall to the magistrate--where she got the arsenic, and how she kneaded\r\nthe cake. \'Why did you do it?\' says he. \'Why,\' says she, \'because he\'s\r\nhateful to me. I prefer Siberia to a life with him.\' That\'s me," and\r\nTaras smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, so she confessed all. Then, naturally--the prison, and father\r\nreturns alone. And harvest time just coming, and mother the only woman\r\nat home, and she no longer strong. So we think what we are to do. Could\r\nwe not bail her out? So father went to see an official. No go. Then\r\nanother. I think he went to five of them, and we thought of giving it\r\nup. Then we happened to come across a clerk--such an artful one as you\r\ndon\'t often find. \'You give me five roubles, and I\'ll get her out,\' says\r\nhe. He agreed to do it for three. Well, and what do you think, friend? I\r\nwent and pawned the linen she herself had woven, and gave him the money.\r\nAs soon as he had written that paper," drawled out Taras, just as if he\r\nwere speaking of a shot being fired, "we succeeded at once. I went to\r\nfetch her myself. Well, friend, so I got to town, put up the mare, took\r\nthe paper, and went to the prison. \'What do you want?\' \'This is what I\r\nwant,\' say I, \'you\'ve got my wife here in prison.\' \'And have you got a\r\npaper?\' I gave him the paper. He gave it a look. \'Wait,\' says he. So I\r\nsat down on a bench. It was already past noon by the sun. An official\r\ncomes out. \'You are Vargoushoff?\' \'I am.\' \'Well, you may take her.\' The\r\ngates opened, and they led her out in her own clothes quite all right.\r\n\'Well, come along. Have you come on foot?\' \'No, I have the horse here.\'\r\nSo I went and paid the ostler, and harnessed, put in all the hay that\r\nwas left, and covered it with sacking for her to sit on. She got in and\r\nwrapped her shawl round her, and off we drove. She says nothing and I\r\nsay nothing. Just as we were coming up to the house she says, \'And how\'s\r\nmother; is she alive?\' \'Yes, she\'s alive.\' \'And father; is he alive?\r\n\'Yes, he is.\' \'Forgive me, Taras,\' she says, \'for my folly. I did not\r\nmyself know what I was doing.\' So I say, \'Words won\'t mend matters. I\r\nhave forgiven you long ago,\' and I said no more. We got home, and she\r\njust fell at mother\'s feet. Mother says, \'The Lord will forgive you.\'\r\nAnd father said, \'How d\'you do?\' and \'What\'s past is past. Live as\r\nbest you can. Now,\' says he, \'is not the time for all that; there\'s\r\nthe harvest to be gathered in down at Skorodino,\' he says. \'Down on the\r\nmanured acre, by the Lord\'s help, the ground has borne such rye that\r\nthe sickle can\'t tackle it. It\'s all interwoven and heavy, and has sunk\r\nbeneath its weight; that must be reaped. You and Taras had better go\r\nand see to it to-morrow.\' Well, friend, from that moment she took to the\r\nwork and worked so that every one wondered. At that time we rented three\r\ndesiatins, and by God\'s help we had a wonderful crop both of oats and\r\nrye. I mow and she binds the sheaves, and sometimes we both of us\r\nreap. I am good at work and not afraid of it, but she\'s better still at\r\nwhatever she takes up. She\'s a smart woman, young, and full of life; and\r\nas to work, friend, she\'d grown that eager that I had to stop her. We\r\nget home, our fingers swollen, our arms aching, and she, instead of\r\nresting, rushes off to the barn to make binders for the sheaves for next\r\nday. Such a change!"\r\n\r\n"Well, and to you? Was she kinder, now?" asked the gardener.\r\n\r\n"That\'s beyond question. She clings to me as if we were one soul.\r\nWhatever I think she understands. Even mother, angry as she was, could\r\nnot help saying: \'It\'s as if our Theodosia had been transformed; she\'s\r\nquite a different woman now!\' We were once going to cart the sheaves\r\nwith two carts. She and I were in the first, and I say, \'How could you\r\nthink of doing that, Theodosia?\' and she says, \'How could I think of it?\r\njust so, I did not wish to live with you. I thought I\'d rather die\r\nthan live with you!\' I say, \'And now?\' and she says, \'Now you\'re in\r\nmy heart!\'" Taras stopped, and smiled joyfully, shook his head as if\r\nsurprised. "Hardly had we got the harvest home when I went to soak the\r\nhemp, and when I got home there was a summons, she must go to be tried,\r\nand we had forgotten all about the matter that she was to be tried for."\r\n\r\n"It can only be the evil one," said the gardener. "Could any man of\r\nhimself think of destroying a living soul? We had a fellow once--" and\r\nthe gardener was about to commence his tale when the train began to\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n"It seems we are coming to a station," he said. "I\'ll go and have a\r\ndrink."\r\n\r\nThe conversation stopped, and Nekhludoff followed the gardener out of\r\nthe carriage onto the wet platform of the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nLE VRAI GRAND MONDE.\r\n\r\nBefore Nekhludoff got out he had noticed in the station yard several\r\nelegant equipages, some with three, some with four, well-fed horses,\r\nwith tinkling bells on their harness. When he stepped out on the wet,\r\ndark-coloured boards of the platform, he saw a group of people in front\r\nof the first-class carriage, among whom were conspicuous a stout\r\nlady with costly feathers on her hat, and a waterproof, and a tall,\r\nthin-legged young man in a cycling suit. The young man had by his side\r\nan enormous, well-fed dog, with a valuable collar. Behind them stood\r\nfootmen, holding wraps and umbrellas, and a coachman, who had also come\r\nto meet the train.\r\n\r\nOn the whole of the group, from the fat lady down to the coachman who\r\nstood holding up his long coat, there lay the stamp of wealth and quiet\r\nself-assurance. A curious and servile crowd rapidly gathered round this\r\ngroup--the station-master, in his red cap, a gendarme, a thin young lady\r\nin a Russian costume, with beads round her neck, who made a point of\r\nseeing the trains come in all through the summer, a telegraph clerk, and\r\npassengers, men and women.\r\n\r\nIn the young man with the dog Nekhludoff recognised young Korchagin,\r\na gymnasium student. The fat lady was the Princess\'s sister, to whose\r\nestate the Korchagins were now moving. The guard, with his gold cord and\r\nshiny top-boots, opened the carriage door and stood holding it as a sign\r\nof deference, while Philip and a porter with a white apron carefully\r\ncarried out the long-faced Princess in her folding chair. The sisters\r\ngreeted each other, and French sentences began flying about. Would the\r\nPrincess go in a closed or an open carriage? At last the procession\r\nstarted towards the exit, the lady\'s maid, with her curly fringe,\r\nparasol and leather case in the rear.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff not wishing to meet them and to have to take leave over\r\nagain, stopped before he got to the door, waiting for the procession to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nThe Princess, her son, Missy, the doctor, and the maid went out first,\r\nthe old Prince and his sister-in-law remained behind. Nekhludoff was too\r\nfar to catch anything but a few disconnected French sentences of their\r\nconversation One of the sentences uttered by the Prince, as it often\r\nhappens, for some unaccountable reason remained in his memory with all\r\nits intonations and the sound of the voice.\r\n\r\n"_Oh, il est du vrai grand monde, du vrai grand monde_," said the Prince\r\nin his loud, self-assured tone as he went out of the station with his\r\nsister-in-law, accompanied by the respectful guards and porters.\r\n\r\nAt this moment from behind the corner of the station suddenly appeared\r\na crowd of workmen in bark shoes, wearing sheepskin coats and carrying\r\nbags on their backs. The workmen went up to the nearest carriage with\r\nsoft yet determined steps, and were about to get in, but were at\r\nonce driven away by a guard. Without stopping, the workmen passed\r\non, hurrying and jostling one another, to the next carriage and began\r\ngetting in, catching their bags against the corners and door of the\r\ncarriage, but another guard caught sight of them from the door of the\r\nstation, and shouted at them severely. The workmen, who had already got\r\nin, hurried out again and went on, with the same soft and firm steps,\r\nstill further towards Nekhludoff\'s carriage. A guard was again going to\r\nstop them, but Nekhludoff said there was plenty of room inside, and that\r\nthey had better get in. They obeyed and got in, followed by Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nThe workmen were about to take their seats, when the gentleman with the\r\ncockade and the two ladies, looking at this attempt to settle in their\r\ncarriage as a personal insult to themselves, indignantly protested and\r\nwanted to turn them out. The workmen--there were 20 of them, old men\r\nand quite young ones, all of them wearied, sunburnt, with haggard\r\nfaces--began at once to move on through the carriage, catching the\r\nseats, the walls, and the doors with their bags. They evidently felt\r\nthey had offended in some way, and seemed ready to go on indefinitely\r\nwherever they were ordered to go.\r\n\r\n"Where are you pushing to, you fiends? Sit down here," shouted another\r\nguard they met.\r\n\r\n"Voila encore des nouvelles," exclaimed the younger of the two ladies,\r\nquite convinced that she would attract Nekhludoff\'s notice by her good\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nThe other lady with the bracelets kept sniffing and making faces,\r\nand remarked something about how pleasant it was to sit with smelly\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nThe workmen, who felt the joy and calm experienced by people who have\r\nescaped some kind of danger, threw off their heavy bags with a movement\r\nof their shoulders and stowed them away under the seats.\r\n\r\nThe gardener had left his own seat to talk with Taras, and now went\r\nback, so that there were two unoccupied seats opposite and one next to\r\nTaras. Three of the workmen took these seats, but when Nekhludoff came\r\nup to them, in his gentleman\'s clothing, they got so confused that they\r\nrose to go away, but Nekhludoff asked them to stay, and himself sat down\r\non the arm of the seat, by the passage down the middle of the carriage.\r\n\r\nOne of the workmen, a man of about 50, exchanged a surprised and even\r\nfrightened look with a young man. That Nekhludoff, instead of scolding\r\nand driving them away, as was natural to a gentleman, should give up his\r\nseat to them, astonished and perplexed them. They even feared that this\r\nmight have some evil result for them.\r\n\r\nHowever, they soon noticed that there was no underlying plot when they\r\nheard Nekhludoff talking quite simply with Taras, and they grew quiet\r\nand told one of the lads to sit down on his bag and give his seat to\r\nNekhludoff. At first the elderly workman who sat opposite Nekhludoff\r\nshrank and drew back his legs for fear of touching the gentleman, but\r\nafter a while he grew quite friendly, and in talking to him and Taras\r\neven slapped Nekhludoff on the knee when he wanted to draw special\r\nattention to what he was saying.\r\n\r\nHe told them all about his position and his work in the peat bogs,\r\nwhence he was now returning home. He had been working there for two and\r\na half months, and was bringing home his wages, which only came to 10\r\nroubles, since part had been paid beforehand when he was hired. They\r\nworked, as he explained, up to their knees in water from sunrise to\r\nsunset, with two hours\' interval for dinner.\r\n\r\n"Those who are not used to it find it hard, of course," he said; "but\r\nwhen one\'s hardened it doesn\'t matter, if only the food is right. At\r\nfirst the food was bad. Later the people complained, and they got good\r\nfood, and it was easy to work."\r\n\r\nThen he told them how, during 28 years he went out to work, and sent all\r\nhis earnings home. First to his father, then to his eldest brother, and\r\nnow to his nephew, who was at the head of the household. On himself he\r\nspent only two or three roubles of the 50 or 60 he earned a year, just\r\nfor luxuries--tobacco and matches.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a sinner, when tired I even drink a little vodka sometimes," he\r\nadded, with a guilty smile.\r\n\r\nThen he told them how the women did the work at home, and how the\r\ncontractor had treated them to half a pail of vodka before they started\r\nto-day, how one of them had died, and another was returning home ill.\r\nThe sick workman he was talking about was in a corner of the same\r\ncarriage. He was a young lad, with a pale, sallow face and bluish lips.\r\nHe was evidently tormented by intermittent fever. Nekhludoff went up to\r\nhim, but the lad looked up with such a severe and suffering expression\r\nthat Nekhludoff did not care to bother him with questions, but advised\r\nthe elder man to give him quinine, and wrote down the name of the\r\nmedicine. He wished to give him some money, but the old workman said he\r\nwould pay for it himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, much as I have travelled, I have never met such a gentleman\r\nbefore. Instead of punching your head, he actually gives up his place\r\nto you," said the old man to Taras. "It seems there are all sorts of\r\ngentlefolk, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, this is quite a new and different world," thought Nekhludoff,\r\nlooking at these spare, sinewy, limbs, coarse, home-made garments,\r\nand sunburnt, kindly, though weary-looking faces, and feeling himself\r\nsurrounded on all sides with new people and the serious interests, joys,\r\nand sufferings of a life of labour.\r\n\r\n"Here is_ le vrai grand monde_," thought Nekhludoff, remembering the\r\nwords of Prince Korchagin and all that idle, luxurious world to which\r\nthe Korchagins belonged, with their petty, mean interests. And he felt\r\nthe joy of a traveller on discovering a new, unknown, and beautiful\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF BOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA MAKES NEW FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nThe gang of prisoners to which Maslova belonged had walked about three\r\nthousand three hundred miles. She and the other prisoners condemned for\r\ncriminal offences had travelled by rail and by steamboats as far as the\r\ntown of Perm. It was only here that Nekhludoff succeeded in obtaining a\r\npermission for her to continue the journey with the political prisoners,\r\nas Vera Doukhova, who was among the latter, advised him to do. The\r\njourney up to Perm had been very trying to Maslova both morally and\r\nphysically. Physically, because of the overcrowding, the dirt, and the\r\ndisgusting vermin, which gave her no peace; morally, because of the\r\nequally disgusting men. The men, like the vermin, though they changed\r\nat each halting-place, were everywhere alike importunate; they swarmed\r\nround her, giving her no rest. Among the women prisoners and the men\r\nprisoners, the jailers and the convoy soldiers, the habit of a kind of\r\ncynical debauch was so firmly established that unless a female prisoner\r\nwas willing to utilise her position as a woman she had to be constantly\r\non the watch. To be continually in a state of fear and strife was very\r\ntrying. And Maslova was specially exposed to attacks, her appearance\r\nbeing attractive and her past known to every one. The decided resistance\r\nwith which she now met the importunity of all the men seemed offensive\r\nto them, and awakened another feeling, that of ill-will towards her. But\r\nher position was made a little easier by her intimacy with Theodosia,\r\nand Theodosia\'s husband, who, having heard of the molestations his wife\r\nwas subject to, had in Nijni been arrested at his own desire in order\r\nto be able to protect her, and was now travelling with the gang as a\r\nprisoner. Maslova\'s position became much more bearable when she was\r\nallowed to join the political prisoners, who were provided with better\r\naccomodations, better food, and were treated less rudely, but besides\r\nall this Maslova\'s condition was much improved because among the\r\npolitical prisoners she was no longer molested by the men, and could\r\nlive without being reminded of that past which she was so anxious to\r\nforget. But the chief advantage of the change lay in the fact that she\r\nmade the acquaintance of several persons who exercised a decided and\r\nmost beneficial influence on her character. Maslova was allowed to stop\r\nwith the political prisoners at all the halting-places, but being a\r\nstrong and healthy woman she was obliged to march with the criminal\r\nconvicts. In this way she walked all the way from Tomsk. Two political\r\nprisoners also marched with the gang, Mary Pavlovna Schetinina, the girl\r\nwith the hazel eyes who had attracted Nekhludoff\'s attention when he had\r\nbeen to visit Doukhova in prison, and one Simonson, who was on his\r\nway to the Takoutsk district, the dishevelled dark young fellow with\r\ndeep-lying eyes, whom Nekhludoff had also noticed during that visit.\r\nMary Pavlovna was walking because she had given her place on the cart\r\nto one of the criminals, a woman expecting to be confined, and Simonson\r\nbecause he did not dare to avail himself of a class privilege.\r\n\r\nThese three always started early in the morning before the rest of the\r\npolitical prisoners, who followed later on in the carts.\r\n\r\nThey were ready to start in this way just outside a large town, where a\r\nnew convoy officer had taken charge of the gang.\r\n\r\nIt was early on a dull September morning. It kept raining and snowing\r\nalternately, and the cold wind blew in sudden gusts. The whole gang of\r\nprisoners, consisting of four hundred men and fifty women, was already\r\nassembled in the court of the halting station. Some of them were\r\ncrowding round the chief of the convoy, who was giving to specially\r\nappointed prisoners money for two days\' keep to distribute among the\r\nrest, while others were purchasing food from women who had been let into\r\nthe courtyard. One could hear the voices of the prisoners counting their\r\nmoney and making their purchases, and the shrill voices of the women\r\nwith the food.\r\n\r\nSimonson, in his rubber jacket and rubber overshoes fastened with a\r\nstring over his worsted stockings (he was a vegetarian and would not\r\nwear the skin of slaughtered animals), was also in the courtyard waiting\r\nfor the gang to start. He stood by the porch and jotted down in his\r\nnotebook a thought that had occurred to him. This was what he wrote:\r\n"If a bacteria watched and examined a human nail it would pronounce\r\nit inorganic matter, and thus we, examining our globe and watching its\r\ncrust, pronounce it to be inorganic. This is incorrect."\r\n\r\nKatusha and Mary Pavlovna, both wearing top-boots and with shawls tied\r\nround their heads, came out of the building into the courtyard where the\r\nwomen sat sheltered from the wind by the northern wall of the court,\r\nand vied with one another, offering their goods, hot meat pie, fish,\r\nvermicelli, buckwheat porridge, liver, beef, eggs, milk. One had even a\r\nroast pig to offer.\r\n\r\nHaving bought some eggs, bread, fish, and some rusks, Maslova was\r\nputting them into her bag, while Mary Pavlovna was paying the women,\r\nwhen a movement arose among the convicts. All were silent and took their\r\nplaces. The officer came out and began giving the last orders before\r\nstarting. Everything was done in the usual manner. The prisoners were\r\ncounted, the chains on their legs examined, and those who were to\r\nmarch in couples linked together with manacles. But suddenly the angry,\r\nauthoritative voice of the officer shouting something was heard, also\r\nthe sound of a blow and the crying of a child. All was silent for a\r\nmoment and then came a hollow murmur from the crowd. Maslova and Mary\r\nPavlovna advanced towards the spot whence the noise proceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT OF THE MARCH.\r\n\r\nThis is what Mary Pavlovna and Katusha saw when they came up to the\r\nscene whence the noise proceeded. The officer, a sturdy fellow, with\r\nfair moustaches, stood uttering words of foul and coarse abuse, and\r\nrubbing with his left the palm of his right hand, which he had hurt in\r\nhitting a prisoner on the face. In front of him a thin, tall convict,\r\nwith half his head shaved and dressed in a cloak too short for him and\r\ntrousers much too short, stood wiping his bleeding face with one hand,\r\nand holding a little shrieking girl wrapped in a shawl with the other.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give it you" (foul abuse); "I\'ll teach you to reason" (more\r\nabuse); "you\'re to give her to the women!" shouted the officer. "Now,\r\nthen, on with them."\r\n\r\nThe convict, who was exiled by the Commune, had been carrying his little\r\ndaughter all the way from Tomsk, where his wife had died of typhus, and\r\nnow the officer ordered him to be manacled. The exile\'s explanation that\r\nhe could not carry the child if he was manacled irritated the officer,\r\nwho happened to be in a bad temper, and he gave the troublesome prisoner\r\na beating. [A fact described by Lineff in his "Transportation".] Before\r\nthe injured convict stood a convoy soldier, and a black-bearded prisoner\r\nwith manacles on one hand and a look of gloom on his face, which he\r\nturned now to the officer, now to the prisoner with the little girl.\r\n\r\nThe officer repeated his orders for the soldiers to take away the girl.\r\nThe murmur among the prisoners grew louder.\r\n\r\n"All the way from Tomsk they were not put on," came a hoarse voice from\r\nsome one in the rear. "It\'s a child, and not a puppy."\r\n\r\n"What\'s he to do with the lassie? That\'s not the law," said some one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" shouted the officer as if he had been stung, and rushed\r\ninto the crowd.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll teach you the law. Who spoke. You? You?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody says so, because-" said a short, broad-faced prisoner.\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished speaking the officer hit him in the face.\r\n\r\n"Mutiny, is it? I\'ll show you what mutiny means. I\'ll have you all\r\nshot like dogs, and the authorities will be only too thankful. Take the\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\nThe crowd was silent. One convoy soldier pulled away the girl, who was\r\nscreaming desperately, while another manacled the prisoner, who now\r\nsubmissively held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Take her to the women," shouted the officer, arranging his sword belt.\r\n\r\nThe little girl, whose face had grown quite red, was trying to disengage\r\nher arms from under the shawl, and screamed unceasingly. Mary Pavlovna\r\nstepped out from among the crowd and came up to the officer.\r\n\r\n"Will you allow me to carry the little girl?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Who are you?" asked the officer.\r\n\r\n"A political prisoner."\r\n\r\nMary Pavlovna\'s handsome face, with the beautiful prominent eyes (he\r\nhad noticed her before when the prisoners were given into his charge),\r\nevidently produced an effect on the officer. He looked at her in silence\r\nas if considering, then said: "I don\'t care; carry her if you like. It\r\nis easy for you to show pity; if he ran away who would have to answer?"\r\n\r\n"How could he run away with the child in his arms?" said Mary Pavlovna.\r\n\r\n"I have no time to talk with you. Take her if you like."\r\n\r\n"Shall I give her?" asked the soldier.\r\n\r\n"Yes, give her."\r\n\r\n"Come to me," said Mary Pavlovna, trying to coax the child to come to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut the child in the soldier\'s arms stretched herself towards her father\r\nand continued to scream, and would not go to Mary Pavlovna.\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, Mary Pavlovna," said Maslova, getting a rusk out of her\r\nbag; "she will come to me."\r\n\r\nThe little girl knew Maslova, and when she saw her face and the rusk\r\nshe let her take her. All was quiet. The gates were opened, and the gang\r\nstepped out, the convoy counted the prisoners over again, the bags were\r\npacked and tied on to the carts, the weak seated on the top. Maslova\r\nwith the child in her arms took her place among the women next to\r\nTheodosia. Simonson, who had all the time been watching what was going\r\non, stepped with large, determined strides up to the officer, who,\r\nhaving given his orders, was just getting into a trap, and said, "You\r\nhave behaved badly."\r\n\r\n"Get to your place; it is no business of yours."\r\n\r\n"It is my business to tell you that you have behaved badly and I have\r\nsaid it," said Simonson, looking intently into the officer\'s face from\r\nunder his bushy eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"Ready? March!" the officer called out, paying no heed to Simonson, and,\r\ntaking hold of the driver\'s shoulder, he got into the trap. The gang\r\nstarted and spread out as it stepped on to the muddy high road with\r\nditches on each side, which passed through a dense forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMARY PAVLOVNA.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hard conditions in which they were placed, life among\r\nthe political prisoners seemed very good to Katusha after the depraved,\r\nluxurious and effeminate life she had led in town for the last six\r\nyears, and after two months\' imprisonment with criminal prisoners. The\r\nfifteen to twenty miles they did per day, with one day\'s rest after two\r\ndays\' marching, strengthened her physically, and the fellowship with her\r\nnew companions opened out to her a life full of interests such as she\r\nhad never dreamed of. People so wonderful (as she expressed it) as those\r\nwhom she was now going with she had not only never met but could not\r\neven have imagined.\r\n\r\n"There now, and I cried when I was sentenced," she said. "Why, I must\r\nthank God for it all the days of my life. I have learned to know what I\r\nnever should have found out else."\r\n\r\nThe motives she understood easily and without effort that guided these\r\npeople, and, being of the people, fully sympathised with them. She\r\nunderstood that these persons were for the people and against the\r\nupper classes, and though themselves belonging to the upper classes\r\nhad sacrificed their privileges, their liberty and their lives for the\r\npeople. This especially made her value and admire them. She was charmed\r\nwith all the new companions, but particularly with Mary Pavlovna,\r\nand she was not only charmed with her, but loved her with a peculiar,\r\nrespectful and rapturous love. She was struck by the fact that this\r\nbeautiful girl, the daughter of a rich general, who could speak three\r\nlanguages, gave away all that her rich brother sent her, and lived like\r\nthe simplest working girl, and dressed not only simply, but poorly,\r\npaying no heed to her appearance. This trait and a complete absence\r\nof coquetry was particularly surprising and therefore attractive to\r\nMaslova. Maslova could see that Mary Pavlovna knew, and was even pleased\r\nto know, that she was handsome, and yet the effect her appearance had on\r\nmen was not at all pleasing to her; she was even afraid of it, and felt\r\nan absolute disgust to all love affairs. Her men companions knew it, and\r\nif they felt attracted by her never permitted themselves to show it to\r\nher, but treated her as they would a man; but with strangers, who often\r\nmolested her, the great physical strength on which she prided herself\r\nstood her in good stead.\r\n\r\n"It happened once," she said to Katusha, "that a man followed me in the\r\nstreet and would not leave me on any account. At last I gave him such a\r\nshaking that he was frightened and ran away."\r\n\r\nShe became a revolutionary, as she said, because she felt a dislike to\r\nthe life of the well-to-do from childhood up, and loved the life of the\r\ncommon people, and she was always being scolded for spending her time\r\nin the servants\' hall, in the kitchen or the stables instead of the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n"And I found it amusing to be with cooks and the coachmen, and dull with\r\nour gentlemen and ladies," she said. "Then when I came to understand\r\nthings I saw that our life was altogether wrong; I had no mother and I\r\ndid not care for my father, and so when I was nineteen I left home, and\r\nwent with a girl friend to work as a factory hand."\r\n\r\nAfter she left the factory she lived in the country, then returned to\r\ntown and lived in a lodging, where they had a secret printing press.\r\nThere she was arrested and sentenced to hard labour. Mary Pavlovna\r\nsaid nothing about it herself, but Katusha heard from others that Mary\r\nPavlovna was sentenced because, when the lodging was searched by the\r\npolice and one of the revolutionists fired a shot in the dark, she\r\npleaded guilty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had learned to know Mary Pavlovna, Katusha noticed\r\nthat, whatever the conditions she found herself in, Mary Pavlovna never\r\nthought of herself, but was always anxious to serve, to help some one,\r\nin matters small or great. One of her present companions, Novodvoroff,\r\nsaid of her that she devoted herself to philanthropic amusements. And\r\nthis was true. The interest of her whole life lay in the search for\r\nopportunities of serving others. This kind of amusement had become the\r\nhabit, the business of her life. And she did it all so naturally that\r\nthose who knew her no longer valued but simply expected it of her.\r\n\r\nWhen Maslova first came among them, Mary Pavlovna felt repulsed and\r\ndisgusted. Katusha noticed this, but she also noticed that, having made\r\nan effort to overcome these feelings, Mary Pavlovna became particularly\r\ntender and kind to her. The tenderness and kindness of so uncommon\r\na being touched Maslova so much that she gave her whole heart, and\r\nunconsciously accepting her views, could not help imitating her in\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThis devoted love of Katusha touched Mary Pavlovna in her turn, and she\r\nlearned to love Katusha.\r\n\r\nThese women were also united by the repulsion they both felt to sexual\r\nlove. The one loathed that kind of love, having experienced all its\r\nhorrors, the other, never having experienced it, looked on it as\r\nsomething incomprehensible and at the same time as something repugnant\r\nand offensive to human dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSIMONSON.\r\n\r\nMary Pavlovna\'s influence was one that Maslova submitted to because she\r\nloved Mary Pavlovna. Simonson influenced her because he loved her.\r\n\r\nEverybody lives and acts partly according to his own, partly according\r\nto other people\'s, ideas. This is what constitutes one of the great\r\ndifferences among men. To some, thinking is a kind of mental game; they\r\ntreat their reason as if it were a fly-wheel without a connecting strap,\r\nand are guided in their actions by other people\'s ideas, by custom or\r\nlaws; while others look upon their own ideas as the chief motive power\r\nof all their actions, and always listen to the dictates of their own\r\nreason and submit to it, accepting other people\'s opinions only on rare\r\noccasions and after weighing them critically. Simonson was a man of the\r\nlatter sort; he settled and verified everything according to his own\r\nreason and acted on the decisions he arrived at. When a schoolboy\r\nhe made up his mind that his father\'s income, made as a paymaster in\r\ngovernment office was dishonestly gained, and he told his father that it\r\nought to be given to the people. When his father, instead of listening\r\nto him, gave him a scolding, he left his father\'s house and would not\r\nmake use of his father\'s means. Having come to the conclusion that all\r\nthe existing misery was a result of the people\'s ignorance, he joined\r\nthe socialists, who carried on propaganda among the people, as soon as\r\nhe left the university and got a place as a village schoolmaster.\r\nHe taught and explained to his pupils and to the peasants what he\r\nconsidered to be just, and openly blamed what he thought unjust. He was\r\narrested and tried. During his trial he determined to tell his judges\r\nthat his was a just cause, for which he ought not to be tried or\r\npunished. When the judges paid no heed to his words, but went on with\r\nthe trial, he decided not to answer them and kept resolutely silent when\r\nthey questioned him. He was exiled to the Government of Archangel. There\r\nhe formulated a religious teaching which was founded on the theory that\r\neverything in the world was alive, that nothing is lifeless, and that\r\nall the objects we consider to be without life or inorganic are only\r\nparts of an enormous organic body which we cannot compass. A man\'s task\r\nis to sustain the life of that huge organism and all its animate parts.\r\nTherefore he was against war, capital punishment and every kind of\r\nkilling, not only of human beings, but also of animals. Concerning\r\nmarriage, too, he had a peculiar idea of his own; he thought that\r\nincrease was a lower function of man, the highest function being to\r\nserve the already existing lives. He found a confirmation of his\r\ntheory in the fact that there were phacocytes in the blood. Celibates,\r\naccording to his opinion, were the same as phacocytes, their function\r\nbeing to help the weak and the sickly particles of the organism. From\r\nthe moment he came to this conclusion he began to consider himself as\r\nwell as Mary Pavlovna as phacocytes, and to live accordingly, though\r\nas a youth he had been addicted to vice. His love for Katusha did not\r\ninfringe this conception, because he loved her platonically, and such\r\nlove he considered could not hinder his activity as a phacocytes, but\r\nacted, on the contrary, as an inspiration.\r\n\r\nNot only moral, but also most practical questions he decided in his own\r\nway. He applied a theory of his own to all practical business, had rules\r\nrelating to the number of hours for rest and for work, to the kind of\r\nfood to eat, the way to dress, to heat and light up the rooms. With all\r\nthis Simonson was very shy and modest; and yet when he had once made\r\nup his mind nothing could make him waver. And this man had a decided\r\ninfluence on Maslova through his love for her. With a woman\'s instinct\r\nMaslova very soon found out that he loved her. And the fact that\r\nshe could awaken love in a man of that kind raised her in her own\r\nestimation. It was Nekhludoff\'s magnanimity and what had been in the\r\npast that made him offer to marry her, but Simonson loved her such as\r\nshe was now, loved her simply because of the love he bore her. And she\r\nfelt that Simonson considered her to be an exceptional woman, having\r\npeculiarly high moral qualities. She did not quite know what the\r\nqualities he attributed to her were, but in order to be on the safe side\r\nand that he should not be disappointed in her, she tried with all her\r\nmight to awaken in herself all the highest qualities she could conceive,\r\nand she tried to be as good as possible. This had begun while they\r\nwere still in prison, when on a common visiting day she had noticed his\r\nkindly dark blue eyes gazing fixedly at her from under his projecting\r\nbrow. Even then she had noticed that this was a peculiar man, and that\r\nhe was looking at her in a peculiar manner, and had also noticed the\r\nstriking combination of sternness--the unruly hair and the frowning\r\nforehead gave him this appearance--with the child-like kindness and\r\ninnocence of his look. She saw him again in Tomsk, where she joined the\r\npolitical prisoners. Though they had not uttered a word, their looks\r\ntold plainly that they had understood one another. Even after that they\r\nhad had no serious conversation with each other, but Maslova felt that\r\nwhen he spoke in her presence his words were addressed to her, and that\r\nhe spoke for her sake, trying to express himself as plainly as he could;\r\nbut it was when he started walking with the criminal prisoners that they\r\ngrew specially near to one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nUntil they left Perm Nekhludoff only twice managed to see Katusha, once\r\nin Nijni, before the prisoners were embarked on a barge surrounded with\r\na wire netting, and again in Perm in the prison office. At both these\r\ninterviews he found her reserved and unkind. She answered his questions\r\nas to whether she was in want of anything, and whether she was\r\ncomfortable, evasively and bashfully, and, as he thought, with the same\r\nfeeling of hostile reproach which she had shown several times\r\nbefore. Her depressed state of mind, which was only the result of the\r\nmolestations from the men that she was undergoing at the time, tormented\r\nNekhludoff. He feared lest, influenced by the hard and degrading\r\ncircumstances in which she was placed on the journey, she should again\r\nget into that state of despair and discord with her own self which\r\nformerly made her irritable with him, and which had caused her to drink\r\nand smoke excessively to gain oblivion. But he was unable to help her in\r\nany way during this part of the journey, as it was impossible for him to\r\nbe with her. It was only when she joined the political prisoners that he\r\nsaw how unfounded his fears were, and at each interview he noticed that\r\ninner change he so strongly desired to see in her becoming more and more\r\nmarked. The first time they met in Tomsk she was again just as she had\r\nbeen when leaving Moscow. She did not frown or become confused when she\r\nsaw him, but met him joyfully and simply, thanking him for what he had\r\ndone for her, especially for bringing her among the people with whom she\r\nnow was.\r\n\r\nAfter two months\' marching with the gang, the change that had taken\r\nplace within her became noticeable in her appearance. She grew sunburned\r\nand thinner, and seemed older; wrinkles appeared on her temples and\r\nround her mouth. She had no ringlets on her forehead now, and her hair\r\nwas covered with the kerchief; in the way it was arranged, as well as in\r\nher dress and her manners, there was no trace of coquetry left. And this\r\nchange, which had taken place and was still progressing in her, made\r\nNekhludoff very happy.\r\n\r\nHe felt for her something he had never experienced before. This feeling\r\nhad nothing in common with his first poetic love for her, and even less\r\nwith the sensual love that had followed, nor even with the satisfaction\r\nof a duty fulfilled, not unmixed with self-admiration, with which he\r\ndecided to marry her after the trial. The present feeling was simply one\r\nof pity and tenderness. He had felt it when he met her in prison for\r\nthe first time, and then again when, after conquering his repugnance,\r\nhe forgave her the imagined intrigue with the medical assistant in the\r\nhospital (the injustice done her had since been discovered); it was the\r\nsame feeling he now had, only with this difference, that formerly it was\r\nmomentary, and that now it had become permanent. Whatever he was doing,\r\nwhatever he was thinking now, a feeling of pity and tenderness dwelt\r\nwith him, and not only pity and tenderness for her, but for everybody.\r\nThis feeling seemed to have opened the floodgates of love, which had\r\nfound no outlet in Nekhludoff\'s soul, and the love now flowed out to\r\nevery one he met.\r\n\r\nDuring this journey Nekhludoff\'s feelings were so stimulated that he\r\ncould not help being attentive and considerate to everybody, from the\r\ncoachman and the convoy soldiers to the prison inspectors and governors\r\nwhom he had to deal with. Now that Maslova was among the political\r\nprisoners, Nekhludoff could not help becoming acquainted with many of\r\nthem, first in Ekaterinburg, where they had a good deal of freedom and\r\nwere kept altogether in a large cell, and then on the road when Maslova\r\nwas marching with three of the men and four of the women. Coming in\r\ncontact with political exiles in this way made Nekhludoff completely\r\nchange his mind concerning them.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the revolutionary movement in Russia, but\r\nespecially since that first of March, when Alexander II was murdered,\r\nNekhludoff regarded the revolutionists with dislike and contempt. He\r\nwas repulsed by the cruelty and secrecy of the methods they employed\r\nin their struggles against the government, especially the cruel murders\r\nthey committed, and their arrogance also disgusted him. But having\r\nlearned more intimately to know them and all they had suffered at the\r\nhands of the government, he saw that they could not be other than they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nTerrible and endless as were the torments which were inflicted on the\r\ncriminals, there was at least some semblance of justice shown them\r\nbefore and after they were sentenced, but in the case of the political\r\nprisoners there was not even that semblance, as Nekhludoff saw in the\r\ncase of Sholostova and that of many and many of his new acquaintances.\r\nThese people were dealt with like fish caught with a net; everything\r\nthat gets into the nets is pulled ashore, and then the big fish which\r\nare required are sorted out and the little ones are left to perish\r\nunheeded on the shore. Having captured hundreds that were evidently\r\nguiltless, and that could not be dangerous to the government, they left\r\nthem imprisoned for years, where they became consumptive, went out of\r\ntheir minds or committed suicide, and kept them only because they had\r\nno inducement to set them free, while they might be of use to elucidate\r\nsome question at a judicial inquiry, safe in prison. The fate of these\r\npersons, often innocent even from the government point of view, depended\r\non the whim, the humour of, or the amount of leisure at the disposal\r\nof some police officer or spy, or public prosecutor, or magistrate,\r\nor governor, or minister. Some one of these officials feels dull, or\r\ninclined to distinguish himself, and makes a number of arrests, and\r\nimprisons or sets free, according to his own fancy or that of the\r\nhigher authorities. And the higher official, actuated by like motives,\r\naccording to whether he is inclined to distinguish himself, or to what\r\nhis relations to the minister are, exiles men to the other side of the\r\nworld or keeps them in solitary confinement, condemns them to Siberia,\r\nto hard labour, to death, or sets them free at the request of some lady.\r\n\r\nThey were dealt with as in war, and they naturally employed the\r\nmeans that were used against them. And as the military men live in an\r\natmosphere of public opinion that not only conceals from them the guilt\r\nof their actions, but sets these actions up as feats of heroism,\r\nso these political offenders were also constantly surrounded by\r\nan atmosphere of public opinion which made the cruel actions they\r\ncommitted, in the face of danger and at the risk of liberty and life,\r\nand all that is dear to men, seem not wicked but glorious actions.\r\nNekhludoff found in this the explanation of the surprising phenomenon\r\nthat men, with the mildest characters, who seemed incapable of\r\nwitnessing the sufferings of any living creature, much less of\r\ninflicting pain, quietly prepared to murder men, nearly all of them\r\nconsidering murder lawful and just on certain occasions as a means\r\nfor self-defence, for the attainment of higher aims or for the general\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nThe importance they attribute to their cause, and consequently to\r\nthemselves, flowed naturally from the importance the government attached\r\nto their actions, and the cruelty of the punishments it inflicted on\r\nthem. When Nekhludoff came to know them better he became convinced that\r\nthey were not the right-down villains that some imagined them to be, nor\r\nthe complete heroes that others thought them, but ordinary people, just\r\nthe same as others, among whom there were some good and some bad, and\r\nsome mediocre, as there are everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere were some among them who had turned revolutionists because they\r\nhonestly considered it their duty to fight the existing evils, but there\r\nwere also those who chose this work for selfish, ambitious motives; the\r\nmajority, however, was attracted to the revolutionary idea by the desire\r\nfor danger, for risks, the enjoyment of playing with one\'s life, which,\r\nas Nekhludoff knew from his military experiences, is quite common to\r\nthe most ordinary people while they are young and full of energy. But\r\nwherein they differed from ordinary people was that their moral standard\r\nwas a higher one than that of ordinary men. They considered not only\r\nself-control, hard living, truthfulness, but also the readiness to\r\nsacrifice everything, even life, for the common welfare as their duty.\r\nTherefore the best among them stood on a moral level that is not often\r\nreached, while the worst were far below the ordinary level, many of them\r\nbeing untruthful, hypocritical and at the same time self-satisfied and\r\nproud. So that Nekhludoff learned not only to respect but to love some\r\nof his new acquaintances, while he remained more than indifferent to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nKRYLTZOFF\'S STORY.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff grew especially fond of Kryltzoff, a consumptive young man\r\ncondemned to hard labour, who was going with the same gang as Katusha.\r\nNekhludoff had made his acquaintance already in Ekaterinburg, and\r\ntalked with him several times on the road after that. Once, in summer,\r\nNekhludoff spent nearly the whole of a day with him at a halting\r\nstation, and Kryltzoff, having once started talking, told him his\r\nstory and how he had become a revolutionist. Up to the time of his\r\nimprisonment his story was soon told. He lost his father, a rich landed\r\nproprietor in the south of Russia, when still a child. He was the only\r\nson, and his mother brought him up. He learned easily in the university,\r\nas well as the gymnasium, and was first in the mathematical faculty\r\nin his year. He was offered a choice of remaining in the university\r\nor going abroad. He hesitated. He loved a girl and was thinking of\r\nmarriage, and taking part in the rural administration. He did not like\r\ngiving up either offer, and could not make up his mind. At this time\r\nhis fellow-students at the university asked him for money for a common\r\ncause. He did not know that this common cause was revolutionary, which\r\nhe was not interested in at that time, but gave the money from a sense\r\nof comradeship and vanity, so that it should not be said that he was\r\nafraid. Those who received the money were caught, a note was found which\r\nproved that the money had been given by Kryltzoff, he was arrested, and\r\nfirst kept at the police station, then imprisoned.\r\n\r\n"The prison where I was put," Kryltzoff went on to relate (he was\r\nsitting on the high shelf bedstead, his elbows on his knees, with\r\nsunken chest, the beautiful, intelligent eyes with which he looked at\r\nNekhludoff glistening feverishly)--"they were not specially strict in\r\nthat prison. We managed to converse, not only by tapping the wall, but\r\ncould walk about the corridors, share our provisions and our tobacco,\r\nand in the evenings we even sang in chorus. I had a fine voice--yes, if\r\nit had not been for mother it would have been all right, even pleasant\r\nand interesting. Here I made the acquaintance of the famous Petroff--he\r\nafterwards killed himself with a piece of glass at the fortress--and\r\nalso of others. But I was not yet a revolutionary. I also became\r\nacquainted with my neighbours in the cells next to mine. They were both\r\ncaught with Polish proclamations and arrested in the same cause, and\r\nwere tried for an attempt to escape from the convoy when they were being\r\ntaken to the railway station. One was a Pole, Lozinsky; the other a\r\nJew, Rozovsky. Yes. Well, this Rozovsky was quite a boy. He said he\r\nwas seventeen, but he looked fifteen--thin, small, active, with black,\r\nsparkling eyes, and, like most Jews, very musical. His voice was still\r\nbreaking, and yet he sang beautifully. Yes. I saw them both taken to be\r\ntried. They were taken in the morning. They returned in the evening, and\r\nsaid they were condemned to death. No one had expected it. Their case\r\nwas so unimportant; they only tried to get away from the convoy, and had\r\nnot even wounded any one. And then it was so unnatural to execute such\r\na child as Rozovsky. And we in prison all came to the conclusion that it\r\nwas only done to frighten them, and would not be confirmed. At first\r\nwe were excited, and then we comforted ourselves, and life went on\r\nas before. Yes. Well, one evening, a watchman comes to my door and\r\nmysteriously announces to me that carpenters had arrived, and were\r\nputting up the gallows. At first I did not understand. What\'s that? What\r\ngallows? But the watchman was so excited that I saw at once it was\r\nfor our two. I wished to tap and communicate with my comrades, but was\r\nafraid those two would hear. The comrades were also silent. Evidently\r\neverybody knew. In the corridors and in the cells everything was as\r\nstill as death all that evening. They did not tap the wall nor sing.\r\nAt ten the watchman came again and announced that a hangman had arrived\r\nfrom Moscow. He said it and went away. I began calling him back.\r\nSuddenly I hear Rozovsky shouting to me across the corridor: \'What\'s the\r\nmatter? Why do you call him?\' I answered something about asking him to\r\nget me some tobacco, but he seemed to guess, and asked me: \'Why did we\r\nnot sing to-night, why did we not tap the walls?\' I do not remember\r\nwhat I said, but I went away so as not to speak to him. Yes. It was a\r\nterrible night. I listened to every sound all night. Suddenly, towards\r\nmorning, I hear doors opening and somebody walking--many persons. I went\r\nup to my window. There was a lamp burning in the corridor. The first\r\nto pass was the inspector. He was stout, and seemed a resolute,\r\nself-satisfied man, but he looked ghastly pale, downcast, and seemed\r\nfrightened; then his assistant, frowning but resolute; behind them the\r\nwatchman. They passed my door and stopped at the next, and I hear the\r\nassistant calling out in a strange voice: \'Lozinsky, get up and put on\r\nclean linen.\' Yes. Then I hear the creaking of the door; they entered\r\ninto his cell. Then I hear Lozinsky\'s steps going to the opposite side\r\nof the corridor. I could only see the inspector. He stood quite pale,\r\nand buttoned and unbuttoned his coat, shrugging his shoulders. Yes.\r\nThen, as if frightened of something, he moved out of the way. It was\r\nLozinsky, who passed him and came up to my door. A handsome young fellow\r\nhe was, you know, of that nice Polish type: broad shouldered, his head\r\ncovered with fine, fair, curly hair as with a cap, and with beautiful\r\nblue eyes. So blooming, so fresh, so healthy. He stopped in front of my\r\nwindow, so that I could see the whole of his face. A dreadful, gaunt,\r\nlivid face. \'Kryltzoff, have you any cigarettes?\' I wished to pass him\r\nsome, but the assistant hurriedly pulled out his cigarette case and\r\npassed it to him. He took out one, the assistant struck a match, and he\r\nlit the cigarette and began to smoke and seemed to be thinking. Then,\r\nas if he had remembered something, he began to speak. \'It is cruel and\r\nunjust. I have committed no crime. I--\' I saw something quiver in his\r\nwhite young throat, from which I could not take my eyes, and he stopped.\r\nYes. At that moment I hear Rozovsky shouting in his fine, Jewish\r\nvoice. Lozinsky threw away the cigarette and stepped from the door.\r\nAnd Rozovsky appeared at the window. His childish face, with the limpid\r\nblack eyes, was red and moist. He also had clean linen on, the trousers\r\nwere too wide, and he kept pulling them up and trembled all over. He\r\napproached his pitiful face to my window. \'Kryltzoff, it\'s true that the\r\ndoctor has prescribed cough mixture for me, is it not? I am not well.\r\nI\'ll take some more of the mixture.\' No one answered, and he looked\r\ninquiringly, now at me, now at the inspector. What he meant to say\r\nI never made out. Yes. Suddenly the assistant again put on a stern\r\nexpression, and called out in a kind of squeaking tone: \'Now, then, no\r\nnonsense. Let us go.\' Rozovsky seemed incapable of understanding what\r\nawaited him, and hurried, almost ran, in front of him all along the\r\ncorridor. But then he drew back, and I could hear his shrill voice\r\nand his cries, then the trampling of feet, and general hubbub. He was\r\nshrieking and sobbing. The sounds came fainter and fainter, and at\r\nlast the door rattled and all was quiet. Yes. And so they hanged them.\r\nThrottled them both with a rope. A watchman, another one, saw it done,\r\nand told me that Lozinsky did not resist, but Rozovsky struggled for\r\na long time, so that they had to pull him up on to the scaffold and to\r\nforce his head into the noose. Yes. This watchman was a stupid fellow.\r\nHe said: \'They told me, sir, that it would be frightful, but it was\r\nnot at all frightful. After they were hanged they only shrugged their\r\nshoulders twice, like this.\' He showed how the shoulders convulsively\r\nrose and fell. \'Then the hangman pulled a bit so as to tighten the\r\nnoose, and it was all up, and they never budged."\' And Kryltzoff\r\nrepeated the watchman\'s words, "Not at all frightful," and tried to\r\nsmile, but burst into sobs instead.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after that he kept silent, breathing heavily, and\r\nrepressing the sobs that were choking him.\r\n\r\n"From that time I became a revolutionist. Yes," he said, when he was\r\nquieter and finished his story in a few words. He belonged to the\r\nNarodovoltzy party, and was even at the head of the disorganising group,\r\nwhose object was to terrorise the government so that it should give\r\nup its power of its own accord. With this object he travelled\r\nto Petersburg, to Kiev, to Odessa and abroad, and was everywhere\r\nsuccessful. A man in whom he had full confidence betrayed him. He was\r\narrested, tried, kept in prison for two years, and condemned to death,\r\nbut the sentence was mitigated to one of hard labour for life.\r\n\r\nHe went into consumption while in prison, and in the conditions he was\r\nnow placed he had scarcely more than a few months longer to live. This\r\nhe knew, but did not repent of his action, but said that if he had\r\nanother life he would use it in the same way to destroy the conditions\r\nin which such things as he had seen were possible.\r\n\r\nThis man\'s story and his intimacy with him explained to Nekhludoff much\r\nthat he had not previously understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF SEEKS AN INTERVIEW WITH MASLOVA.\r\n\r\nOn the day when the convoy officer had the encounter with the prisoners\r\nat the halting station about the child, Nekhludoff, who had spent\r\nthe night at the village inn, woke up late, and was some time writing\r\nletters to post at the next Government town, so that he left the inn\r\nlater than usual, and did not catch up with the gang on the road as\r\nhe had done previously, but came to the village where the next halting\r\nstation was as it was growing dusk.\r\n\r\nHaving dried himself at the inn, which was kept by an elderly woman who\r\nhad an extraordinarily fat, white neck, he had his tea in a clean room\r\ndecorated with a great number of icons and pictures and then hurried\r\naway to the halting station to ask the officer for an interview\r\nwith Katusha. At the last six halting stations he could not get the\r\npermission for an interview from any of the officers. Though they had\r\nbeen changed several times, not one of them would allow Nekhludoff\r\ninside the halting stations, so that he had not seen Katusha for\r\nmore than a week. This strictness was occasioned by the fact that\r\nan important prison official was expected to pass that way. Now this\r\nofficial had passed without looking in at the gang, after all, and\r\nNekhludoff hoped that the officer who had taken charge of the gang in\r\nthe morning would allow him an interview with the prisoners, as former\r\nofficers had done.\r\n\r\nThe landlady offered Nekhludoff a trap to drive him to the halting\r\nstation, situated at the farther end of the village, but Nekhludoff\r\npreferred to walk. A young labourer, a broad-shouldered young fellow\r\nof herculean dimensions, with enormous top-boots freshly blackened with\r\nstrongly smelling tar, offered himself as a guide.\r\n\r\nA dense mist obscured the sky, and it was so dark that when the young\r\nfellow was three steps in advance of him Nekhludoff could not see him\r\nunless the light of some window happened to fall on the spot, but he\r\ncould hear the heavy boots wading through the deep, sticky slush. After\r\npassing the open place in front of the church and the long street,\r\nwith its rows of windows shining brightly in the darkness, Nekhludoff\r\nfollowed his guide to the outskirts of the village, where it was pitch\r\ndark. But soon here, too, rays of light, streaming through the mist\r\nfrom the lamps in the front of the halting station, became discernible\r\nthrough the darkness. The reddish spots of light grew bigger and bigger;\r\nat last the stakes of the palisade, the moving figure of the sentinel, a\r\npost painted with white and black stripes and the sentinel\'s box became\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe sentinel called his usual "Who goes there?" as they approached, and\r\nseeing they were strangers treated them with such severity that he would\r\nnot allow them to wait by the palisade; but Nekhludoff\'s guide was not\r\nabashed by this severity.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, lad! why so fierce? You go and rouse your boss while we wait\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\nThe sentinel gave no answer, but shouted something in at the gate and\r\nstood looking at the broad-shouldered young labourer scraping the mud\r\noff Nekhludoff\'s boots with a chip of wood by the light of the lamp.\r\nFrom behind the palisade came the hum of male and female voices. In\r\nabout three minutes more something rattled, the gate opened, and a\r\nsergeant, with his cloak thrown over his shoulders, stepped out of the\r\ndarkness into the lamplight.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant was not as strict as the sentinel, but he was extremely\r\ninquisitive. He insisted on knowing what Nekhludoff wanted the officer\r\nfor, and who he was, evidently scenting his booty and anxious not to let\r\nit escape. Nekhludoff said he had come on special business, and would\r\nshow his gratitude, and would the sergeant take a note for him to the\r\nofficer. The sergeant took the note, nodded, and went away. Some time\r\nafter the gate rattled again, and women carrying baskets, boxes, jugs\r\nand sacks came out, loudly chattering in their peculiar Siberian dialect\r\nas they stepped over the threshold of the gate. None of them wore\r\npeasant costumes, but were dressed town fashion, wearing jackets and\r\nfur-lined cloaks. Their skirts were tucked up high, and their heads\r\nwrapped up in shawls. They examined Nekhludoff and his guide curiously\r\nby the light of the lamp. One of them showed evident pleasure at the\r\nsight of the broad-shouldered fellow, and affectionately administered to\r\nhim a dose of Siberian abuse.\r\n\r\n"You demon, what are you doing here? The devil take you," she said,\r\naddressing him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been showing this traveller here the way," answered the young\r\nfellow. "And what have you been bringing here?"\r\n\r\n"Dairy produce, and I am to bring more in the morning."\r\n\r\nThe guide said something in answer that made not only the women but even\r\nthe sentinel laugh, and, turning to Nekhludoff, he said:\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find your way alone? Won\'t get lost, will you?"\r\n\r\n"I shall find it all right."\r\n\r\n"When you have passed the church it\'s the second from the two-storied\r\nhouse. Oh, and here, take my staff," he said, handing the stick he\r\nwas carrying, and which was longer than himself, to Nekhludoff; and\r\nsplashing through the mud with his enormous boots, he disappeared in the\r\ndarkness, together with the women.\r\n\r\nHis voice mingling with the voices of the women was still audible\r\nthrough the fog, when the gate again rattled, and the sergeant appeared\r\nand asked Nekhludoff to follow him to the officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF AND THE OFFICER.\r\n\r\nThis halting station, like all such stations along the Siberian\r\nroad, was surrounded by a courtyard, fenced in with a palisade of\r\nsharp-pointed stakes, and consisted of three one-storied houses. One of\r\nthem, the largest, with grated windows, was for the prisoners, another\r\nfor the convoy soldiers, and the third, in which the office was, for the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThere were lights in the windows of all the three houses, and, like\r\nall such lights, they promised, here in a specially deceptive manner,\r\nsomething cosy inside the walls. Lamps were burning before the porches\r\nof the houses and about five lamps more along the walls lit up the yard.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant led Nekhludoff along a plank which lay across the yard up\r\nto the porch of the smallest of the houses.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone up the three steps of the porch he let Nekhludoff pass\r\nbefore him into the ante-room, in which a small lamp was burning, and\r\nwhich was filled with smoky fumes. By the stove a soldier in a coarse\r\nshirt with a necktie and black trousers, and with one top-boot on, stood\r\nblowing the charcoal in a somovar, using the other boot as bellows. [The\r\nlong boots worn in Russia have concertina-like sides, and when held to\r\nthe chimney of the somovar can be used instead of bellows to make the\r\ncharcoal inside burn up.] When he saw Nekhludoff, the soldier left the\r\nsomovar and helped him off with his waterproof; then went into the inner\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"He has come, your honour."\r\n\r\n"Well, ask him in," came an angry voice.\r\n\r\n"Go in at the door," said the soldier, and went back to the somovar.\r\n\r\nIn the next room an officer with fair moustaches and a very red face,\r\ndressed in an Austrian jacket that closely fitted his broad chest and\r\nshoulders, sat at a covered table, on which were the remains of his\r\ndinner and two bottles; there was a strong smell of tobacco and some\r\nvery strong, cheap scent in the warm room. On seeing Nekhludoff the\r\nofficer rose and gazed ironically and suspiciously, as it seemed, at the\r\nnewcomer.\r\n\r\n"What is it you want?" he asked, and, not waiting for a reply, he\r\nshouted through the open door:\r\n\r\n"Bernoff, the somovar! What are you about?"\r\n\r\n"Coming at once."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get it \'at once\' so that you\'ll remember it," shouted the\r\nofficer, and his eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming," shouted the soldier, and brought in the somovar.\r\nNekhludoff waited while the soldier placed the somovar on the table.\r\nWhen the officer had followed the soldier out of the room with his cruel\r\nlittle eyes looking as if they were aiming where best to hit him, he\r\nmade the tea, got the four-cornered decanter out of his travelling case\r\nand some Albert biscuits, and having placed all this on the cloth he\r\nagain turned to Nekhludoff. "Well, how can I be of service to you?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to be allowed to visit a prisoner," said Nekhludoff,\r\nwithout sitting down.\r\n\r\n"A political one? That\'s forbidden by the law," said the officer.\r\n\r\n"The woman I mean is not a political prisoner," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Yes. But pray take a scat," said the officer. Nekhludoff sat down.\r\n\r\n"She is not a political one, but at my request she has been allowed by\r\nthe higher authorities to join the political prisoners--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I know," interrupted the other; "a little dark one? Well,\r\nyes, that can be managed. Won\'t you smoke?" He moved a box of cigarettes\r\ntowards Nekhludoff, and, having carefully poured out two tumblers of\r\ntea, he passed one to Nekhludoff. "If you please," he said.\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I should like to see--"\r\n\r\n"The night is long. You\'ll have plenty of time. I shall order her to be\r\nsent out to you."\r\n\r\n"But could I not see her where she is? Why need she be sent for?"\r\nNekhludoff said.\r\n\r\n"In to the political prisoners? It is against the law."\r\n\r\n"I have been allowed to go in several times. If there is any danger of\r\nmy passing anything in to them I could do it through her just as well."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; she would be searched," said the officer, and laughed in an\r\nunpleasant manner.\r\n\r\n"Well, why not search me?"\r\n\r\n"All right; we\'ll manage without that," said the officer, opening the\r\ndecanter, and holding it out towards Nekhludoff\'s tumbler of tea. "May\r\nI? No? Well, just as you like. When you are living here in Siberia you\r\nare too glad to meet an educated person. Our work, as you know, is the\r\nsaddest, and when one is used to better things it is very hard. The idea\r\nthey have of us is that convoy officers are coarse, uneducated men, and\r\nno one seems to remember that we may have been born for a very different\r\nposition."\r\n\r\nThis officer\'s red face, his scents, his rings, and especially his\r\nunpleasant laughter disgusted Nekhludoff very much, but to-day, as\r\nduring the whole of his journey, he was in that serious, attentive state\r\nwhich did not allow him to behave slightingly or disdainfully towards\r\nany man, but made him feel the necessity of speaking to every one\r\n"entirely," as he expressed to himself, this relation to men. When he\r\nhad heard the officer and understood his state of mind, he said in a\r\nserious manner:\r\n\r\n"I think that in your position, too, some comfort could be found in\r\nhelping the suffering people," he said.\r\n\r\n"What are their sufferings? You don\'t know what these people are."\r\n\r\n"They are not special people," said Nekhludoff; "they are just such\r\npeople as others, and some of them are quite innocent."\r\n\r\n"Of course, there are all sorts among them, and naturally one pities\r\nthem. Others won\'t let anything off, but I try to lighten their\r\ncondition where I can. It\'s better that I should suffer, but not they.\r\nOthers keep to the law in every detail, even as far as to shoot, but\r\nI show pity. May I?--Take another," he said, and poured out another\r\ntumbler of tea for Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"And who is she, this woman that you want to see?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"It is an unfortunate woman who got into a brothel, and was there\r\nfalsely accused of poisoning, and she is a very good woman," Nekhludoff\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThe officer shook his head. "Yes, it does happen. I can tell you about\r\na certain Emma who lived in Kasan. She was a Hungarian by birth, but she\r\nhad quite Persian eyes," he continued, unable to restrain a smile at the\r\nrecollection; "there was so much chic about her that a countess--"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff interrupted the officer and returned to the former topic of\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"I think that you could lighten the condition of the people while they\r\nare in your charge. And in acting that way I am sure you would find\r\ngreat joy!" said Nekhludoff, trying to pronounce as distinctly as\r\npossible, as he might if talking to a foreigner or a child.\r\n\r\nThe officer looked at Nekhludoff impatiently, waiting for him to stop\r\nso as to continue the tale about the Hungarian with Persian eyes, who\r\nevidently presented herself very vividly to his imagination and quite\r\nabsorbed his attention.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course, this is all quite true," he said, "and I do pity them;\r\nbut I should like to tell you about Emma. What do you think she did--?"\r\n\r\n"It does not interest me," said Nekhludoff, "and I will tell you\r\nstraight, that though I was myself very different at one time, I now\r\nhate that kind of relation to women."\r\n\r\nThe officer gave Nekhludoff a frightened look.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you take some more tea?" he said.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you."\r\n\r\n"Bernoff!" the officer called, "take the gentleman to Vakouloff. Tell\r\nhim to let him into the separate political room. He may remain there\r\ntill the inspection."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL PRISONERS.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the orderly, Nekhludoff went out into the courtyard,\r\nwhich was dimly lit up by the red light of the lamps.\r\n\r\n"Where to?" asked the convoy sergeant, addressing the orderly.\r\n\r\n"Into the separate cell, No. 5."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t pass here; the boss has gone to the village and taken the\r\nkeys."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, pass this way."\r\n\r\nThe soldier led Nekhludoff along a board to another entrance. While\r\nstill in the yard Nekhludoff could hear the din of voices and general\r\ncommotion going on inside as in a beehive when the bees are preparing to\r\nswarm; but when he came nearer and the door opened the din grew louder,\r\nand changed into distinct sounds of shouting, abuse and laughter. He\r\nheard the clatter of chairs and smelt the well-known foul air. This din\r\nof voices and the clatter of the chairs, together with the close smell,\r\nalways flowed into one tormenting sensation, and produced in Nekhludoff\r\na feeling of moral nausea which grew into physical sickness, the two\r\nfeelings mingling with and heightening each other.\r\n\r\nThe first thing Nekhludoff saw, on entering, was a large, stinking tub.\r\nA corridor into which several doors opened led from the entrance. The\r\nfirst was the family room, then the bachelors\' room, and at the very end\r\ntwo small rooms were set apart for the political prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe buildings, which were arranged to hold one hundred and fifty\r\nprisoners, now that there were four hundred and fifty inside, were so\r\ncrowded that the prisoners could not all get into the rooms, but filled\r\nthe passage, too. Some were sitting or lying on the floor, some were\r\ngoing out with empty teapots, or bringing them back filled with boiling\r\nwater. Among the latter was Taras. He overtook Nekhludoff and greeted\r\nhim affectionately. The kind face of Taras was disfigured by dark\r\nbruises on his nose and under his eye.\r\n\r\n"What has happened to you?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Yes, something did happen," Taras said, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"All because of the woman," added a prisoner, who followed Taras; "he\'s\r\nhad a row with Blind Fedka."\r\n\r\n"And how\'s Theodosia?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s all right. Here I am bringing her the water for her tea," Taras\r\nanswered, and went into the family room.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked in at the door. The room was crowded with women and\r\nmen, some of whom were on and some under the bedsteads; it was full of\r\nsteam from the wet clothes that were drying, and the chatter of women\'s\r\nvoices was unceasing. The next door led into the bachelors\' room. This\r\nroom was still more crowded; even the doorway and the passage in front\r\nof it were blocked by a noisy crowd of men, in wet garments, busy doing\r\nor deciding something or other.\r\n\r\nThe convoy sergeant explained that it was the prisoner appointed to buy\r\nprovisions, paying off out of the food money what was owing to a sharper\r\nwho had won from or lent money to the prisoners, and receiving back\r\nlittle tickets made of playing cards. When they saw the convoy soldier\r\nand a gentleman, those who were nearest became silent, and followed\r\nthem with looks of ill-will. Among them Nekhludoff noticed the criminal\r\nFedoroff, whom he knew, and who always kept a miserable lad with\r\na swelled appearance and raised eyebrows beside him, and also a\r\ndisgusting, noseless, pock-marked tramp, who was notorious among the\r\nprisoners because he killed his comrade in the marshes while trying to\r\nescape, and had, as it was rumoured, fed on his flesh. The tramp stood\r\nin the passage with his wet cloak thrown over one shoulder, looking\r\nmockingly and boldly at Nekhludoff, and did not move out of the way.\r\nNekhludoff passed him by.\r\n\r\nThough this kind of scene had now become quite familiar to him, though\r\nhe had during the last three months seen these four hundred criminal\r\nprisoners over and over again in many different circumstances; in the\r\nheat, enveloped in clouds of dust which they raised as they dragged\r\ntheir chained feet along the road, and at the resting places by the way,\r\nwhere the most horrible scenes of barefaced debauchery had occurred, yet\r\nevery time he came among them, and felt their attention fixed upon him\r\nas it was now, shame and consciousness of his sin against them tormented\r\nhim. To this sense of shame and guilt was added an unconquerable feeling\r\nof loathing and horror. He knew that, placed in a position such as\r\ntheirs, they could not be other than they were, and yet he was unable to\r\nstifle his disgust.\r\n\r\n"It\'s well for them do-nothings," Nekhludoff heard some one say in a\r\nhoarse voice as he approached the room of the political prisoners. Then\r\nfollowed a word of obscene abuse, and spiteful, mocking laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMAKAR DEVKIN.\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed the bachelors\' room the sergeant who accompanied\r\nNekhludoff left him, promising to come for him before the inspection\r\nwould take place. As soon as the sergeant was gone a prisoner, quickly\r\nstepping with his bare feet and holding up the chains, came close up to\r\nNekhludoff, enveloping him in the strong, acid smell of perspiration,\r\nand said in a mysterious whisper:\r\n\r\n"Help the lad, sir; he\'s got into an awful mess. Been drinking. To-day\r\nhe\'s given his name as Karmanoff at the inspection. Take his part, sir.\r\nWe dare not, or they\'ll kill us," and looking uneasily round he turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThis is what had happened. The criminal Kalmanoff had persuaded a young\r\nfellow who resembled him in appearance and was sentenced to exile to\r\nchange names with him and go to the mines instead of him, while he only\r\nwent to exile. Nekhludoff knew all this. Some convict had told him about\r\nthis exchange the week before. He nodded as a sign that he understood\r\nand would do what was in his power, and continued his way without\r\nlooking round.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff knew this convict, and was surprised by his action. When in\r\nEkaterinburg the convict had asked Nekhludoff to get a permission for\r\nhis wife to follow him. The convict was a man of medium size and of the\r\nmost ordinary peasant type, about thirty years old. He was condemned to\r\nhard labour for an attempt to murder and rob. His name was Makar Devkin.\r\nHis crime was a very curious one. In the account he gave of it to\r\nNekhludoff, he said it was not his but his devil\'s doing. He said that\r\na traveller had come to his father\'s house and hired his sledge to drive\r\nhim to a village thirty miles off for two roubles. Makar\'s father told\r\nhim to drive the stranger. Makar harnessed the horse, dressed, and\r\nsat down to drink tea with the stranger. The stranger related at the\r\ntea-table that he was going to be married and had five hundred roubles,\r\nwhich he had earned in Moscow, with him. When he had heard this, Makar\r\nwent out into the yard and put an axe into the sledge under the straw.\r\n"And I did not myself know why I was taking the axe," he said. "\'Take\r\nthe axe,\' says _he_, and I took it. We got in and started. We drove\r\nalong all right; I even forgot about the axe. Well, we were getting\r\nnear the village; only about four miles more to go. The way from the\r\ncross-road to the high road was up hill, and I got out. I walked behind\r\nthe sledge and _he_ whispers to me, \'What are you thinking about? When\r\nyou get to the top of the hill you will meet people along the highway,\r\nand then there will be the village. He will carry the money away. If\r\nyou mean to do it, now\'s the time.\' I stooped over the sledge as if to\r\narrange the straw, and the axe seemed to jump into my hand of itself.\r\nThe man turned round. \'What are you doing?\' I lifted the axe and tried\r\nto knock him down, but he was quick, jumped out, and took hold of my\r\nhands. \'What are you doing, you villain?\' He threw me down into the\r\nsnow, and I did not even struggle, but gave in at once. He bound my arms\r\nwith his girdle, and threw me into the sledge, and took me straight to\r\nthe police station. I was imprisoned and tried. The commune gave me a\r\ngood character, said that I was a good man, and that nothing wrong had\r\nbeen noticed about me. The masters for whom I worked also spoke well of\r\nme, but we had no money to engage a lawyer, and so I was condemned to\r\nfour years\' hard labour."\r\n\r\nIt was this man who, wishing to save a fellow-villager, knowing that he\r\nwas risking his life thereby, told Nekhludoff the prisoner\'s secret, for\r\ndoing which (if found out) he should certainly be throttled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA AND HER COMPANIONS.\r\n\r\nThe political prisoners were kept in two small rooms, the doors of which\r\nopened into a part of the passage partitioned off from the rest. The\r\nfirst person Nekhludoff saw on entering into this part of the passage\r\nwas Simonson in his rubber jacket and with a log of pine wood in his\r\nhands, crouching in front of a stove, the door of which trembled, drawn\r\nin by the heat inside.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Nekhludoff he looked up at him from under his protruding\r\nbrow, and gave him his hand without rising.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have come; I want to speak to you," he said, looking\r\nNekhludoff straight in the eyes with an expression of importance.\r\n\r\n"Yes; what is it?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"It will do later on; I am busy just now," and Simonson turned again\r\ntowards the stove, which he was heating according to a theory of his\r\nown, so as to lose as little heat energy as possible.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was going to enter in at the first door, when Maslova,\r\nstooping and pushing a large heap of rubbish and dust towards the stove\r\nwith a handleless birch broom, came out of the other. She had a white\r\njacket on, her skirt was tucked up, and a kerchief, drawn down to her\r\neyebrows, protected her hair from the dust. When she saw Nekhludoff, she\r\ndrew herself up, flushing and animated, put down the broom, wiped her\r\nhands on her skirt, and stopped right in front of him. "You are tidying\r\nup the apartments, I see," said Nekhludoff, shaking hands.\r\n\r\n"Yes; my old occupation," and she smiled. "But the dirt! You can\'t\r\nimagine what it is. We have been cleaning and cleaning. Well, is the\r\nplaid dry?" she asked, turning to Simonson.\r\n\r\n"Almost," Simonson answered, giving her a strange look, which struck\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'ll come for it, and will bring the cloaks to dry. Our\r\npeople are all in here," she said to Nekhludoff, pointing to the first\r\ndoor as she went out of the second.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff opened the door and entered a small room dimly lit by a\r\nlittle metal lamp, which was standing low down on the shelf bedstead. It\r\nwas cold in the room, and there was a smell of the dust, which had not\r\nhad time to settle, damp and tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nOnly those who were close to the lamp were clearly visible, the\r\nbedsteads were in the shade and wavering shadows glided over the walls.\r\nTwo men, appointed as caterers, who had gone to fetch boiling water and\r\nprovisions, were away; most of the political prisoners were gathered\r\ntogether in the small room. There was Nekhludoff\'s old acquaintance,\r\nVera Doukhova, with her large, frightened eyes, and the swollen vein on\r\nher forehead, in a grey jacket with short hair, and thinner and yellower\r\nthan ever.. She had a newspaper spread out in front of her, and sat\r\nrolling cigarettes with a jerky movement of her hands.\r\n\r\nEmily Rintzeva, whom Nekhludoff considered to be the pleasantest of the\r\npolitical prisoners, was also here. She looked after the housekeeping,\r\nand managed to spread a feeling of home comfort even in the midst of\r\nthe most trying surroundings. She sat beside the lamp, with her sleeves\r\nrolled up, wiping cups and mugs, and placing them, with her deft, red\r\nand sunburnt hands, on a cloth that was spread on the bedstead. Rintzeva\r\nwas a plain-looking young woman, with a clever and mild expression of\r\nface, which, when she smiled, had a way of suddenly becoming merry,\r\nanimated and captivating. It was with such a smile that she now welcomed\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Why, we thought you had gone back to Russia," she said.\r\n\r\nHere in a dark corner was also Mary Pavlovna, busy with a little,\r\nfair-haired girl, who kept prattling in her sweet, childish accents.\r\n\r\n"How nice that you have come," she said to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Katusha? And we have a visitor here," and she pointed to\r\nthe little girl.\r\n\r\nHere was also Anatole Kryltzoff with felt boots on, sitting in a far\r\ncorner with his feet under him, doubled up and shivering, his arms\r\nfolded in the sleeves of his cloak, and looking at Nekhludoff with\r\nfeverish eyes. Nekhludoff was going up to him, but to the right of\r\nthe door a man with spectacles and reddish curls, dressed in a rubber\r\njacket, sat talking to the pretty, smiling Grabetz. This was the\r\ncelebrated revolutionist Novodvoroff. Nekhludoff hastened to greet him.\r\nHe was in a particular hurry about it, because this man was the only one\r\namong all the political prisoners whom he disliked. Novodvoroff\'s eyes\r\nglistened through his spectacles as he looked at Nekhludoff and held his\r\nnarrow hand out to him.\r\n\r\n"Well, are you having a pleasant journey?" he asked, with apparent\r\nirony.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is much that is interesting," Nekhludoff answered, as if\r\nhe did not notice the irony, but took the question for politeness, and\r\npassed on to Kryltzoff.\r\n\r\nThough Nekhludoff appeared indifferent, he was really far from\r\nindifferent, and these words of Novodvoroff, showing his evident desire\r\nto say or do something unpleasant, interfered with the state of kindness\r\nin which Nekhludoff found himself, and he felt depressed and sad.\r\n\r\n"Well, how are you?" he asked, pressing Kryltzoff\'s cold and trembling\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, only I cannot get warm; I got wet through," Kryltzoff\r\nanswered, quickly replacing his hands into the sleeves of his cloak.\r\n"And here it is also beastly cold. There, look, the window-panes are\r\nbroken," and he pointed to the broken panes behind the iron bars. "And\r\nhow are you? Why did you not come?"\r\n\r\n"I was not allowed to, the authorities were so strict, but to-day the\r\nofficer is lenient."\r\n\r\n"Lenient indeed!" Kryltzoff remarked. "Ask Mary what she did this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nMary Pavlovna from her place in the corner related what had happened\r\nabout the little girl that morning when they left the halting station.\r\n\r\n"I think it is absolutely necessary to make a collective protest," said\r\nVera Doukhova, in a determined tone, and yet looking now at one, now\r\nat another, with a frightened, undecided look. "Valdemar Simonson did\r\nprotest, but that is not sufficient."\r\n\r\n"What protest!" muttered Kryltzoff, cross and frowning. Her want\r\nof simplicity, artificial tone and nervousness had evidently been\r\nirritating him for a long time.\r\n\r\n"Are you looking for Katusha?" he asked, addressing Nekhludoff. "She is\r\nworking all the time. She has cleaned this, the men\'s room, and now she\r\nhas gone to clean the women\'s! Only it is not possible to clean away\r\nthe fleas. And what is Mary doing there?" he asked, nodding towards the\r\ncorner where Mary Pavlovna sat.\r\n\r\n"She is combing out her adopted daughter\'s hair," replied Rintzeva.\r\n\r\n"But won\'t she let the insects loose on us?" asked Kryltzoff.\r\n\r\n"No, no; I am very careful. She is a clean little girl now. You take\r\nher," said Mary, turning to Rintzeva, "while I go and help Katusha, and\r\nI will also bring him his plaid."\r\n\r\nRintzeva took the little girl on her lap, pressing her plump, bare,\r\nlittle arms to her bosom with a mother\'s tenderness, and gave her a bit\r\nof sugar. As Mary Pavlovna left the room, two men came in with boiling\r\nwater and provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nNABATOFF AND MARKEL.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who came in was a short, thin, young man, who had a\r\ncloth-covered sheepskin coat on, and high top-boots. He stepped lightly\r\nand quickly, carrying two steaming teapots, and holding a loaf wrapped\r\nin a cloth under his arm.\r\n\r\n"Well, so our prince has put in an appearance again," he said, as he\r\nplaced the teapot beside the cups, and handed the bread to Rintzeva.\r\n"We have bought wonderful things," he continued, as he took off his\r\nsheepskin, and flung it over the heads of the others into the corner\r\nof the bedstead. "Markel has bought milk and eggs. Why, we\'ll have\r\na regular ball to-day. And Rintzeva is spreading out her aesthetic\r\ncleanliness," he said, and looked with a smile at Rintzeva, "and now she\r\nwill make the tea."\r\n\r\nThe whole presence of this man--his motion, his voice, his look--seemed\r\nto breathe vigour and merriment. The other newcomer was just the reverse\r\nof the first. He looked despondent and sad. He was short, bony, had very\r\nprominent cheek bones, a sallow complexion, thin lips and beautiful,\r\ngreenish eyes, rather far apart. He wore an old wadded coat, top-boots\r\nand goloshes, and was carrying two pots of milk and two round boxes\r\nmade of birch bark, which he placed in front of Rintzeva. He bowed to\r\nNekhludoff, bending only his neck, and with his eyes fixed on him. Then,\r\nhaving reluctantly given him his damp hand to shake, he began to take\r\nout the provisions.\r\n\r\nBoth these political prisoners were of the people; the first was\r\nNabatoff, a peasant; the second, Markel Kondratieff, a factory hand.\r\nMarkel did not come among the revolutionists till he was quite a man,\r\nNabatoff only eighteen. After leaving the village school, owing to\r\nhis exceptional talents Nabatoff entered the gymnasium, and maintained\r\nhimself by giving lessons all the time he studied there, and obtained\r\nthe gold medal. He did not go to the university because, while still in\r\nthe seventh class of the gymnasium, he made up his mind to go among the\r\npeople and enlighten his neglected brethren. This he did, first getting\r\nthe place of a Government clerk in a large village. He was soon arrested\r\nbecause he read to the peasants and arranged a co-operative industrial\r\nassociation among them. They kept him imprisoned for eight months and\r\nthen set him free, but he remained under police supervision. As soon\r\nas he was liberated he went to another village, got a place as\r\nschoolmaster, and did the same as he had done in the first village.\r\nHe was again taken up and kept fourteen months in prison, where his\r\nconvictions became yet stronger. After that he was exiled to the Perm\r\nGovernment, from where he escaped. Then he was put to prison for seven\r\nmonths and after that exiled to Archangel. There he refused to take the\r\noath of allegiance that was required of them and was condemned to\r\nbe exiled to the Takoutsk Government, so that half his life since he\r\nreached manhood was passed in prison and exile. All these adventures did\r\nnot embitter him nor weaken his energy, but rather stimulated it. He was\r\na lively young fellow, with a splendid digestion, always active, gay\r\nand vigorous. He never repented of anything, never looked far ahead, and\r\nused all his powers, his cleverness, his practical knowledge to act in\r\nthe present. When free he worked towards the aim he had set himself, the\r\nenlightening and the uniting of the working men, especially the country\r\nlabourers. When in prison he was just as energetic and practical in\r\nfinding means to come in contact with the outer world, and in arranging\r\nhis own life and the life of his group as comfortably as the conditions\r\nwould allow. Above all things he was a communist. He wanted, as it\r\nseemed to him, nothing for himself and contented himself with very\r\nlittle, but demanded very much for the group of his comrades, and could\r\nwork for it either physically or mentally day and night, without sleep\r\nor food. As a peasant he had been industrious, observant, clever at\r\nhis work, and naturally self-controlled, polite without any effort, and\r\nattentive not only to the wishes but also the opinions of others. His\r\nwidowed mother, an illiterate, superstitious, old peasant woman, was\r\nstill living, and Nabatoff helped her and went to see her while he was\r\nfree. During the time he spent at home he entered into all the interests\r\nof his mother\'s life, helped her in her work, and continued his\r\nintercourse with former playfellows; smoked cheap tobacco with them in\r\nso-called "dog\'s feet," [a kind of cigarette that the peasants smoke,\r\nmade of a bit of paper and bent at one end into a hook] took part\r\nin their fist fights, and explained to them how they were all being\r\ndeceived by the State, and how they ought to disentangle themselves out\r\nof the deception they were kept in. When he thought or spoke of what a\r\nrevolution would do for the people he always imagined this people from\r\nwhom he had sprung himself left in very nearly the same conditions\r\nas they were in, only with sufficient land and without the gentry and\r\nwithout officials. The revolution, according to him, and in this\r\nhe differed from Novodvoroff and Novodvoroff\'s follower, Markel\r\nKondratieff, should not alter the elementary forms of the life of the\r\npeople, should not break down the whole edifice, but should only alter\r\nthe inner walls of the beautiful, strong, enormous old structure he\r\nloved so dearly. He was also a typical peasant in his views on religion,\r\nnever thinking about metaphysical questions, about the origin of\r\nall origin, or the future life. God was to him, as also to Arago, an\r\nhypothesis, which he had had no need of up to now. He had no business\r\nwith the origin of the world, whether Moses or Darwin was right.\r\nDarwinism, which seemed so important to his fellows, was only the same\r\nkind of plaything of the mind as the creation in six days. The question\r\nhow the world had originated did not interest him, just because the\r\nquestion how it would be best to live in this world was ever before him.\r\nHe never thought about future life, always bearing in the depth of his\r\nsoul the firm and quiet conviction inherited from his forefathers, and\r\ncommon to all labourers on the land, that just as in the world of plants\r\nand animals nothing ceases to exist, but continually changes its form,\r\nthe manure into grain, the grain into a food, the tadpole into a frog,\r\nthe caterpillar into a butterfly, the acorn into an oak, so man also\r\ndoes not perish, but only undergoes a change. He believed in this, and\r\ntherefore always looked death straight in the face, and bravely bore the\r\nsufferings that lead towards it, but did not care and did not know how\r\nto speak about it. He loved work, was always employed in some practical\r\nbusiness, and put his comrades in the way of the same kind of practical\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe other political prisoner from among the people, Markel Kondratieff,\r\nwas a very different kind of man. He began to work at the age of\r\nfifteen, and took to smoking and drinking in order to stifle a dense\r\nsense of being wronged. He first realised he was wronged one Christmas\r\nwhen they, the factory children, were invited to a Christmas tree, got\r\nup by the employer\'s wife, where he received a farthing whistle, an\r\napple, a gilt walnut and a fig, while the employer\'s children had\r\npresents given them which seemed gifts from fairyland, and had cost more\r\nthan fifty roubles, as he afterwards heard.\r\n\r\nWhen he was twenty a celebrated revolutionist came to their factory to\r\nwork as a working girl, and noticing his superior qualities began giving\r\nbooks and pamphlets to Kondratieff and to talk and explain his position\r\nto him, and how to remedy it. When the possibility of freeing himself\r\nand others from their oppressed state rose clearly in his mind, the\r\ninjustice of this state appeared more cruel and more terrible than\r\nbefore, and he longed passionately not only for freedom, but also for\r\nthe punishment of those who had arranged and who kept up this cruel\r\ninjustice. Kondratieff devoted himself with passion to the acquirement\r\nof knowledge. It was not clear to him how knowledge should bring about\r\nthe realisation of the social ideal, but he believed that the knowledge\r\nthat had shown him the injustice of the state in which he lived would\r\nalso abolish that injustice itself. Besides knowledge would, in his\r\nopinion, raise him above others. Therefore he left off drinking and\r\nsmoking, and devoted all his leisure time to study. The revolutionist\r\ngave him lessons, and his thirst for every kind of knowledge, and the\r\nfacility with which he took it in, surprised her. In two years he had\r\nmastered algebra, geometry, history--which he was specially fond of--and\r\nmade acquaintance with artistic and critical, and especially socialistic\r\nliterature. The revolutionist was arrested, and Kondratieff with her,\r\nforbidden books having been found in their possession, and they were\r\nimprisoned and then exiled to the Vologda Government. There Kondratieff\r\nbecame acquainted with Novodvoroff, and read a great deal more\r\nrevolutionary literature, remembered it all, and became still firmer\r\nin his socialistic views. While in exile he became leader in a large\r\nstrike, which ended in the destruction of a factory and the murder of\r\nthe director. He was again arrested and condemned to Siberia.\r\n\r\nHis religious views were of the same negative nature as his views of the\r\nexisting economic conditions. Having seen the absurdity of the religion\r\nin which he was brought up, and having gained with great effort, and\r\nat first with fear, but later with rapture, freedom from it, he did\r\nnot tire of viciously and with venom ridiculing priests and religious\r\ndogmas, as if wishing to revenge himself for the deception that had been\r\npractised on him.\r\n\r\nHe was ascetic through habit, contented himself with very little, and,\r\nlike all those used to work from childhood and whose muscles have been\r\ndeveloped, he could work much and easily, and was quick at any manual\r\nlabour; but what he valued most was the leisure in prisons and halting\r\nstations, which enabled him to continue his studies. He was now studying\r\nthe first volume of Karl Marks\'s, and carefully hid the book in his sack\r\nas if it were a great treasure. He behaved with reserve and indifference\r\nto all his comrades, except Novodvoroff, to whom he was greatly\r\nattached, and whose arguments on all subjects he accepted as\r\nunanswerable truths.\r\n\r\nHe had an indefinite contempt for women, whom he looked upon as a\r\nhindrance in all necessary business. But he pitied Maslova and was\r\ngentle with her, for he considered her an example of the way the lower\r\nare exploited by the upper classes. The same reason made him dislike\r\nNekhludoff, so that he talked little with him, and never pressed\r\nNekhludoff\'s hand, but only held out his own to be pressed when greeting\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLOVE AFFAIRS OF THE EXILES.\r\n\r\nThe stove had burned up and got warm, the tea was made and poured out\r\ninto mugs and cups, and milk was added to it; rusks, fresh rye and wheat\r\nbread, hard-boiled eggs, butter, and calf\'s head and feet were placed on\r\nthe cloth. Everybody moved towards the part of the shelf beds which took\r\nthe place of the table and sat eating and talking. Rintzeva sat on a box\r\npouring out the tea. The rest crowded round her, only Kryltzoff, who had\r\ntaken off his wet cloak and wrapped himself in his dry plaid and lay in\r\nhis own place talking to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nAfter the cold and damp march and the dirt and disorder they had found\r\nhere, and after the pains they had taken to get it tidy, after having\r\ndrunk hot tea and eaten, they were all in the best and brightest of\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tramp of feet, the screams and abuse of the criminals,\r\nreached them through the wall, reminding them of their surroundings,\r\nseemed only to increase the sense of coziness. As on an island in the\r\nmidst of the sea, these people felt themselves for a brief interval not\r\nswamped by the degradation and sufferings which surrounded them; this\r\nmade their spirits rise, and excited them. They talked about everything\r\nexcept their present position and that which awaited them. Then, as it\r\ngenerally happens among young men, and women especially, if they are\r\nforced to remain together, as these people were, all sorts of agreements\r\nand disagreements and attractions, curiously blended, had sprung up\r\namong them. Almost all of them were in love. Novodvoroff was in love\r\nwith the pretty, smiling Grabetz. This Grabetz was a young, thoughtless\r\ngirl who had gone in for a course of study, perfectly indifferent to\r\nrevolutionary questions, but succumbing to the influence of the day, she\r\ncompromised herself in some way and was exiled. The chief interest of\r\nher life during the time of her trial in prison and in exile was her\r\nsuccess with men, just as it had been when she was free. Now on the way\r\nshe comforted herself with the fact that Novodvoroff had taken a fancy\r\nto her, and she fell in love with him. Vera Doukhova, who was very prone\r\nto fall in love herself, but did not awaken love in others, though she\r\nwas always hoping for mutual love, was sometimes drawn to Nabatoff, then\r\nto Novodvoroff. Kryltzoff felt something like love for Mary Pavlovna. He\r\nloved her with a man\'s love, but knowing how she regarded this sort of\r\nlove, hid his feelings under the guise of friendship and gratitude\r\nfor the tenderness with which she attended to his wants. Nabatoff and\r\nRintzeva were attached to each other by very complicated ties. Just as\r\nMary Pavlovna was a perfectly chaste maiden, in the same way Rintzeva\r\nwas perfectly chaste as her own husband\'s wife. When only a schoolgirl\r\nof sixteen she fell in love with Rintzeff, a student of the Petersburg\r\nUniversity, and married him before he left the university, when she was\r\nonly nineteen years old. During his fourth year at the university her\r\nhusband had become involved in the students\' rows, was exiled from\r\nPetersburg, and turned revolutionist. She left the medical courses she\r\nwas attending, followed him, and also turned revolutionist. If she had\r\nnot considered her husband the cleverest and best of men she would not\r\nhave fallen in love with him; and if she had not fallen in love would\r\nnot have married; but having fallen in love and married him whom she\r\nthought the best and cleverest of men, she naturally looked upon life\r\nand its aims in the way the best and cleverest of men looked at them. At\r\nfirst he thought the aim of life was to learn, and she looked upon study\r\nas the aim of life. He became a revolutionist, and so did she. She could\r\ndemonstrate very clearly that the existing state of things could not go\r\non, and that it was everybody\'s duty to fight this state of things and\r\nto try to bring about conditions in which the individual could develop\r\nfreely, etc. And she imagined that she really thought and felt all\r\nthis, but in reality she only regarded everything her husband thought\r\nas absolute truth, and only sought for perfect agreement, perfect\r\nidentification of her own soul with his which alone could give her full\r\nmoral satisfaction. The parting with her husband and their child, whom\r\nher mother had taken, was very hard to bear; but she bore it firmly and\r\nquietly, since it was for her husband\'s sake and for that cause which\r\nshe had not the slightest doubt was true, since he served it. She was\r\nalways with her husband in thoughts, and did not love and could not love\r\nany other any more than she had done before. But Nabatoff\'s devoted and\r\npure love touched and excited her. This moral, firm man, her husband\'s\r\nfriend, tried to treat her as a sister, but something more appeared in\r\nhis behaviour to her, and this something frightened them both, and yet\r\ngave colour to their life of hardship.\r\n\r\nSo that in all this circle only Mary Pavlovna and Kondratieff were quite\r\nfree from love affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCONVERSATIONS IN PRISON.\r\n\r\nExpecting to have a private talk with Katusha, as usual, after tea,\r\nNekhludoff sat by the side of Kryltzoff, conversing with him. Among\r\nother things he told him the story of Makar\'s crime and about his\r\nrequest to him. Kryltzoff listened attentively, gazing at Nekhludoff\r\nwith glistening eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Kryltzoff suddenly, "I often think that here we are going\r\nside by side with them, and who are they? The same for whose sake we\r\nare going, and yet we not only do not know them, but do not even wish to\r\nknow them. And they, even worse than that, they hate us and look upon us\r\nas enemies. This is terrible."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing terrible about it," broke in Novodvoroff. "The masses\r\nalways worship power only. The government is in power, and they worship\r\nit and hate us. To-morrow we shall have the power, and they will worship\r\nus," he said with his grating voice. At that moment a volley of abuse\r\nand the rattle of chains sounded from behind the wall, something was\r\nheard thumping against it and screaming and shrieking, some one was\r\nbeing beaten, and some one was calling out, "Murder! help!"\r\n\r\n"Hear them, the beasts! What intercourse can there be between us and\r\nsuch as them?" quietly remarked Novodvoroff.\r\n\r\n"You call them beasts, and Nekhludoff was just telling me about such an\r\naction!" irritably retorted Kryltzoff, and went on to say how Makar was\r\nrisking his life to save a fellow-villager. "That is not the action of a\r\nbeast, it is heroism."\r\n\r\n"Sentimentality!" Novodvoroff ejaculated ironically; "it is difficult\r\nfor us to understand the emotions of these people and the motives on\r\nwhich they act. You see generosity in the act, and it may be simply\r\njealousy of that other criminal."\r\n\r\n"How is it that you never wish to see anything good in another?" Mary\r\nPavlovna said suddenly, flaring up.\r\n\r\n"How can one see what does not exist!"\r\n\r\n"How does it not exist, when a man risks dying a terrible death?"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Novodvoroff, "that if we mean to do our work, the first\r\ncondition is that" (here Kondratieff put down the book he was reading by\r\nthe lamplight and began to listen attentively to his master\'s words) "we\r\nshould not give way to fancy, but look at things as they are. We should\r\ndo all in our power for the masses, and expect nothing in return.\r\nThe masses can only be the object of our activity, but cannot be our\r\nfellow-workers as long as they remain in that state of inertia they are\r\nin at present," he went on, as if delivering a lecture. "Therefore, to\r\nexpect help from them before the process of development--that process\r\nwhich we are preparing them for--has taken place is an illusion."\r\n\r\n"What process of development?" Kryltzoff began, flushing all over. "We\r\nsay that we are against arbitrary rule and despotism, and is this not\r\nthe most awful despotism?"\r\n\r\n"No despotism whatever," quietly rejoined Novodvoroff. "I am only saying\r\nthat I know the path that the people must travel, and can show them that\r\npath."\r\n\r\n"But how can you be sure that the path you show is the true path?\r\nIs this not the same kind of despotism that lay at the bottom of the\r\nInquisition, all persecutions, and the great revolution? They, too, knew\r\nthe one true way, by means of their science."\r\n\r\n"Their having erred is no proof of my going to err; besides, there is a\r\ngreat difference between the ravings of idealogues and the facts based\r\non sound, economic science." Novodvoroff\'s voice filled the room; he\r\nalone was speaking, all the rest were silent.\r\n\r\n"They are always disputing," Mary Pavlovna said, when there was a\r\nmoment\'s silence.\r\n\r\n"And you yourself, what do you think about it?" Nekhludoff asked her.\r\n\r\n"I think Kryltzoff is right when he says we should not force our views\r\non the people."\r\n\r\n"And you, Katusha?" asked Nekhludoff with a smile, waiting anxiously for\r\nher answer, fearing she would say something awkward.\r\n\r\n"I think the common people are wronged," she said, and blushed scarlet.\r\n"I think they are dreadfully wronged."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Maslova, quite right," cried Nabatoff. "They are terribly\r\nwronged, the people, and they must not be wronged, and therein lies the\r\nwhole of our task."\r\n\r\n"A curious idea of the object of revolution," Novodvoroff remarked\r\ncrossly, and began to smoke.\r\n\r\n"I cannot talk to him," said Kryltzoff in a whisper, and was silent.\r\n\r\n"And it is much better not to talk," Nekhludoff said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nNOVODVOROFF.\r\n\r\nAlthough Novodvoroff was highly esteemed of all the revolutionists,\r\nthough he was very learned, and considered very wise, Nekhludoff\r\nreckoned him among those of the revolutionists who, being below the\r\naverage moral level, were very far below it. His inner life was of a\r\nnature directly opposite to that of Simonson\'s. Simonson was one of\r\nthose people (of an essentially masculine type) whose actions follow\r\nthe dictates of their reason, and are determined by it. Novodvoroff\r\nbelonged, on the contrary, to the class of people of a feminine type,\r\nwhose reason is directed partly towards the attainment of aims set by\r\ntheir feelings, partly to the justification of acts suggested by their\r\nfeelings. The whole of Novodvoroff\'s revolutionary activity, though\r\nhe could explain it very eloquently and very convincingly, appeared\r\nto Nekhludoff to be founded on nothing but ambition and the desire\r\nfor supremacy. At first his capacity for assimilating the thoughts of\r\nothers, and of expressing them correctly, had given him a position of\r\nsupremacy among pupils and teachers in the gymnasium and the university,\r\nwhere qualities such as his are highly prized, and he was satisfied.\r\nWhen he had finished his studies and received his diploma he suddenly\r\naltered his views, and from a modern liberal he turned into a rabid\r\nNarodovoletz, in order (so Kryltzoff, who did not like him, said) to\r\ngain supremacy in another sphere.\r\n\r\nAs he was devoid of those moral and aesthetic qualities which call\r\nforth doubts and hesitation, he very soon acquired a position in the\r\nrevolutionary world which satisfied him--that of the leader of a party.\r\nHaving once chosen a direction, he never doubted or hesitated, and was\r\ntherefore certain that he never made a mistake. Everything seemed quite\r\nsimple, clear and certain. And the narrowness and one-sidedness of his\r\nviews did make everything seem simple and clear. One only had to be\r\nlogical, as he said. His self-assurance was so great that it either\r\nrepelled people or made them submit to him. As he carried on his work\r\namong very young people, his boundless self-assurance led them to\r\nbelieve him very profound and wise; the majority did submit to him,\r\nand he had a great success in revolutionary circles. His activity was\r\ndirected to the preparation of a rising in which he was to usurp the\r\npower and call together a council. A programme, composed by him, should\r\nbe proposed before the council, and he felt sure that this programme of\r\nhis solved every problem, and that it would be impossible not to carry\r\nit out.\r\n\r\nHis comrades respected but did not love him. He did not love any one,\r\nlooked upon all men of note as upon rivals, and would have willingly\r\ntreated them as old male monkeys treat young ones if he could have done\r\nit. He would have torn all mental power, every capacity, from other men,\r\nso that they should not interfere with the display of his talents. He\r\nbehaved well only to those who bowed before him. Now, on the journey he\r\nbehaved well to Kondratieff, who was influenced by his propaganda; to\r\nVera Doukhova and pretty little Grabetz, who were both in love with him.\r\nAlthough in principle he was in favour of the woman\'s movement, yet in\r\nthe depth of his soul he considered all women stupid and insignificant\r\nexcept those whom he was sentimentally in love with (as he was now in\r\nlove with Grabetz), and such women he considered to be exceptions, whose\r\nmerits he alone was capable of discerning.\r\n\r\nThe question of the relations of the sexes he also looked upon as\r\nthoroughly solved by accepting free union. He had one nominal and\r\none real wife, from both of whom he was separated, having come to the\r\nconclusion that there was no real love between them, and now he thought\r\nof entering on a free union with Grabetz. He despised Nekhludoff\r\nfor "playing the fool," as Novodvoroff termed it, with Maslova, but\r\nespecially for the freedom Nekhludoff took of considering the defects\r\nof the existing system and the methods of correcting those defects in a\r\nmanner which was not only not exactly the same as Novodvoroff\'s, but was\r\nNekhludoff\'s own--a prince\'s, that is, a fool\'s manner. Nekhludoff felt\r\nthis relation of Novodvoroff\'s towards him, and knew to his sorrow that\r\nin spite of the state of good will in which he found himself on this\r\njourney he could not help paying this man in his own coin, and could not\r\nstifle the strong antipathy he felt for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nSIMONSON SPEAKS TO NEKHLUDOFF.\r\n\r\nThe voices of officials sounded from the next room. All the prisoners\r\nwere silent, and a sergeant, followed by two convoy soldiers, entered.\r\nThe time of the inspection had come. The sergeant counted every one, and\r\nwhen Nekhludoff\'s turn came he addressed him with kindly familiarity.\r\n\r\n"You must not stay any longer, Prince, after the inspection; you must go\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff knew what this meant, went up to the sergeant and shoved a\r\nthree-rouble note into his hand.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, what is one to do with you; stay a bit longer, if you like."\r\nThe sergeant was about to go when another sergeant, followed by a\r\nconvict, a spare man with a thin beard and a bruise under his eye, came\r\nin.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about the girl I have come," said the convict.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s daddy come," came the ringing accents of a child\'s voice, and a\r\nflaxen head appeared from behind Rintzeva, who, with Katusha\'s and Mary\r\nPavlovna\'s help, was making a new garment for the child out of one of\r\nRintzeva\'s own petticoats.\r\n\r\n"Yes, daughter, it\'s me," Bousovkin, the prisoner, said softly.\r\n\r\n"She is quite comfortable here," said Mary Pavlovna, looking with pity\r\nat Bousovkin\'s bruised face. "Leave her with us."\r\n\r\n"The ladies are making me new clothes," said the girl, pointing to\r\nRintzeva\'s sewing--"nice red ones," she went on, prattling.\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to sleep with us?" asked Rintzeva, caressing the child.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I wish. And daddy, too."\r\n\r\n"No, daddy can\'t. Well, leave her then," she said, turning to the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you may leave her," said the first sergeant, and went out with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of the room Nabatoff went up to Bousovkin,\r\nslapped him on the shoulder, and said: "I say, old fellow, is it true\r\nthat Karmanoff wishes to exchange?"\r\n\r\nBousovkin\'s kindly, gentle face turned suddenly sad and a veil seemed to\r\ndim his eyes.\r\n\r\n"We have heard nothing--hardly," he said, and with the same dimness\r\nstill over his eyes he turned to the child.\r\n\r\n"Well, Aksutka, it seems you\'re to make yourself comfortable with the\r\nladies," and he hurried away.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true about the exchange, and he knows it very well," said\r\nNabatoff.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"I shall tell the authorities in the next town. I know both prisoners by\r\nsight," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nAll were silent, fearing a recommencement of the dispute.\r\n\r\nSimonson, who had been lying with his arms thrown back behind his head,\r\nand not speaking, rose, and determinately walked up to Nekhludoff,\r\ncarefully passing round those who were sitting.\r\n\r\n"Could you listen to me now?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," and Nekhludoff rose and followed him.\r\n\r\nKatusha looked up with an expression of suspense, and meeting\r\nNekhludoff\'s eyes, she blushed and shook her head.\r\n\r\n"What I want to speak to you about is this," Simonson began, when they\r\nhad come out into the passage. In the passage the din of the criminal\'s\r\nvoices and shouts sounded louder. Nekhludoff made a face, but Simonson\r\ndid not seem to take any notice.\r\n\r\n"Knowing of your relations to Katerina Maslova," he began seriously and\r\nfrankly, with his kind eyes looking straight into Nekhludoff\'s face,\r\n"I consider it my duty"--He was obliged to stop because two voices were\r\nheard disputing and shouting, both at once, close to the door.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, blockhead, they are not mine," one voice shouted.\r\n\r\n"May you choke, you devil," snorted the other.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mary Pavlovna came out into the passage.\r\n\r\n"How can one talk here?" she said; "go in, Vera is alone there," and she\r\nwent in at the second door, and entered a tiny room, evidently meant for\r\na solitary cell, which was now placed at the disposal of the political\r\nwomen prisoners, Vera Doukhova lay covered up, head and all, on the bed.\r\n\r\n"She has got a headache, and is asleep, so she cannot hear you, and I\r\nwill go away," said Mary Pavlovna.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, stay here," said Simonson; "I have no secrets from any\r\none, certainly none from you."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Mary Pavlovna, and moving her whole body from side to\r\nside, like a child, so as to get farther back on to the bed, she settled\r\ndown to listen, her beautiful hazel eyes seeming to look somewhere far\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, this is my business," Simonson repeated. "Knowing of your\r\nrelations to Katerina Maslova, I consider myself bound to explain to you\r\nmy relations to her."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff could not help admiring the simplicity and truthfulness with\r\nwhich Simonson spoke to him.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that I should like to marry Katerina Maslova--"\r\n\r\n"How strange!" said Mary Pavlovna, fixing her eyes on Simonson.\r\n\r\n"--And so I made up my mind to ask her to be my wife," Simonson\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n"What can I do? It depends on her," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but she will not come to any decision without you."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because as long as your relations with her are unsettled she cannot\r\nmake up her mind."\r\n\r\n"As far as I am concerned, it is finally settled. I should like to do\r\nwhat I consider to be my duty and also to lighten her fate, but on no\r\naccount would I wish to put any restraint on her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but she does not wish to accept your sacrifice."\r\n\r\n"It is no sacrifice."\r\n\r\n"And I know that this decision of hers is final."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, there is no need to speak to me," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"She wants you to acknowledge that you think as she does."\r\n\r\n"How can I acknowledge that I must not do what I consider to be my duty?\r\nAll I can say is that I am not free, but she is."\r\n\r\nSimonson was silent; then, after thinking a little, he said: "Very\r\nwell, then, I\'ll tell her. You must not think I am in love with her,"\r\nhe continued; "I love her as a splendid, unique, human being who has\r\nsuffered much. I want nothing from her. I have only an awful longing to\r\nhelp her, to lighten her posi--"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was surprised to hear the trembling in Simonson\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"--To lighten her position," Simonson continued. "If she does not wish\r\nto accept your help, let her accept mine. If she consents, I shall ask\r\nto be sent to the place where she will be imprisoned. Four years are\r\nnot an eternity. I would live near her, and perhaps might lighten her\r\nfate--" and he again stopped, too agitated to continue.\r\n\r\n"What am I to say?" said Nekhludoff. "I am very glad she has found such\r\na protector as you--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I wanted to know," Simonson interrupted.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to know if, loving her and wishing her happiness, you would\r\nconsider it good for her to marry me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Nekhludoff decidedly.\r\n\r\n"It all depends on her; I only wish that this suffering soul should find\r\nrest," said Simonson, with such childlike tenderness as no one could\r\nhave expected from so morose-looking a man.\r\n\r\nSimonson rose, and stretching his lips out to Nekhludoff, smiled shyly\r\nand kissed him.\r\n\r\n"So I shall tell her," and he went away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n"I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY."\r\n\r\n"What do you think of that?" said Mary Pavlovna. "In love--quite in\r\nlove. Now, that\'s a thing I never should have expected, that Valdemar\r\nSimonson should be in love, and in the silliest, most boyish manner. It\r\nis strange, and, to say the truth, it is sad," and she sighed.\r\n\r\n"But she? Katusha? How does she look at it, do you think?" Nekhludoff\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"She?" Mary Pavlovna waited, evidently wishing to give as exact an\r\nanswer as possible. "She? Well, you see, in spite of her past she\r\nhas one of the most moral natures--and such fine feelings. She loves\r\nyou--loves you well, and is happy to be able to do you even the negative\r\ngood of not letting you get entangled with her. Marriage with you would\r\nbe a terrible fall for her, worse than all that\'s past, and therefore\r\nshe will never consent to it. And yet your presence troubles her."\r\n\r\n"Well, what am I to do? Ought I to vanish?"\r\n\r\nMary Pavlovna smiled her sweet, childlike smile, and said, "Yes,\r\npartly."\r\n\r\n"How is one to vanish partly?"\r\n\r\n"I am talking nonsense. But as for her, I should like to tell you that\r\nshe probably sees the silliness of this rapturous kind of love (he has\r\nnot spoken to her), and is both flattered and afraid of it. I am not\r\ncompetent to judge in such affairs, you know, still I believe that on\r\nhis part it is the most ordinary man\'s feeling, though it is masked. He\r\nsays that this love arouses his energy and is Platonic, but I know that\r\neven if it is exceptional, still at the bottom it is degrading."\r\n\r\nMary Pavlovna had wandered from the subject, having started on her\r\nfavourite theme.\r\n\r\n"Well, but what am I to do?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"I think you should tell her everything; it is always best that\r\neverything should be clear. Have a talk with her; I shall call her.\r\nShall I?" said Mary Pavlovna.\r\n\r\n"If you please," said Nekhludoff, and Mary Pavlovna went.\r\n\r\nA strange feeling overcame Nekhludoff when he was alone in the little\r\nroom with the sleeping Vera Doukhova, listening to her soft breathing,\r\nbroken now and then by moans, and to the incessant dirt that came\r\nthrough the two doors that separated him from the criminals. What\r\nSimonson had told him freed him from the self-imposed duty, which had\r\nseemed hard and strange to him in his weak moments, and yet now he felt\r\nsomething that was not merely unpleasant but painful.\r\n\r\nHe had a feeling that this offer of Simonson\'s destroyed the exceptional\r\ncharacter of his sacrifice, and thereby lessened its value in his own\r\nand others\' eyes; if so good a man who was not bound to her by any kind\r\nof tie wanted to join his fate to hers, then this sacrifice was not so\r\ngreat. There may have also been an admixture of ordinary jealousy. He\r\nhad got so used to her love that he did not like to admit that she loved\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThen it also upset the plans he had formed of living near her while\r\nshe was doing her term. If she married Simonson his presence would be\r\nunnecessary, and he would have to form new plans.\r\n\r\nBefore he had time to analyse his feelings the loud din of the\r\nprisoners\' voices came in with a rush (something special was going on\r\namong them to-day) as the door opened to let Katusha in.\r\n\r\nShe stepped briskly close up to him and said, "Mary Pavlovna has sent\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I must have a talk with you. Sit down. Valdemar Simonson has been\r\nspeaking to me."\r\n\r\nShe sat down and folded her hands in her lap and seemed quite calm, but\r\nhardly had Nekhludoff uttered Simonson\'s name when she flushed crimson.\r\n\r\n"What did he say?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"He told me he wanted to marry you."\r\n\r\nHer face suddenly puckered up with pain, but she said nothing and only\r\ncast down her eyes.\r\n\r\n"He is asking for my consent or my advice. I told him that it all\r\ndepends entirely on you--that you must decide."\r\n\r\n"Ah, what does it all mean? Why?" she muttered, and looked in his eyes\r\nwith that peculiar squint that always strangely affected Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\nThey sat silent for a few minutes looking into each other\'s eyes, and\r\nthis look told much to both of them.\r\n\r\n"You must decide," Nekhludoff repeated.\r\n\r\n"What am I to decide? Everything has long been decided."\r\n\r\n"No; you must decide whether you will accept Mr. Simonson\'s offer," said\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"What sort of a wife can I be--I, a convict? Why should I ruin Mr.\r\nSimonson, too?" she said, with a frown.\r\n\r\n"Well, but if the sentence should be mitigated."\r\n\r\n"Oh, leave me alone. I have nothing more to say," she said, and rose to\r\nleave the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nNEVEROFF\'S FATE.\r\n\r\nWhen, following Katusha, Nekhludoff returned to the men\'s room, he found\r\nevery one there in agitation. Nabatoff, who went about all over the\r\nplace, and who got to know everybody, and noticed everything, had\r\njust brought news which staggered them all. The news was that he had\r\ndiscovered a note on a wall, written by the revolutionist Petlin, who\r\nhad been sentenced to hard labour, and who, every one thought, had long\r\nsince reached the Kara; and now it turned out that he had passed this\r\nway quite recently, the only political prisoner among criminal convicts.\r\n\r\n"On the 17th of August," so ran the note, "I was sent off alone with\r\nthe criminals. Neveroff was with me, but hanged himself in the lunatic\r\nasylum in Kasan. I am well and in good spirits and hope for the best."\r\n\r\nAll were discussing Petlin\'s position and the possible reasons of\r\nNeveroff\'s suicide. Only Kryltzoff sat silent and preoccupied, his\r\nglistening eyes gazing fixedly in front of him.\r\n\r\n"My husband told me that Neveroff had a vision while still in the\r\nPetropavlovski prison," said Rintzeva.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he was a poet, a dreamer; this sort of people cannot stand\r\nsolitary confinement," said Novodvoroff. "Now, I never gave my\r\nimagination vent when in solitary confinement, but arranged my days most\r\nsystematically, and in this way always bore it very well."\r\n\r\n"What is there unbearable about it? Why, I used to be glad when they\r\nlocked me up," said Nabatoff cheerfully, wishing to dispel the general\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n"A fellow\'s afraid of everything; of being arrested himself and\r\nentangling others, and of spoiling the whole business, and then he gets\r\nlocked up, and all responsibility is at an end, and he can rest; he can\r\njust sit and smoke."\r\n\r\n"You knew him well?" asked Mary Pavlovna, glancing anxiously at the\r\naltered, haggard expression of Kryltzoff\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Neveroff a dreamer?" Kryltzoff suddenly began, panting for breath as\r\nif he had been shouting or singing for a long time. "Neveroff was a man\r\n\'such as the earth bears few of,\' as our doorkeeper used to express it.\r\nYes, he had a nature like crystal, you could see him right through; he\r\ncould not lie, he could not dissemble; not simply thin skinned, but\r\nwith all his nerves laid bare, as if he were flayed. Yes, his was a\r\ncomplicated, rich nature, not such a-- But where is the use of talking?"\r\nhe added, with a vicious frown. "Shall we first educate the people\r\nand then change the forms of life, or first change the forms and then\r\nstruggle, using peaceful propaganda or terrorism? So we go on disputing\r\nwhile _they_ kill; _they_ do not dispute--they know their business; they\r\ndon\'t care whether dozens, hundreds of men perish--and what men! No;\r\nthat the best should perish is just what they want. Yes, Herzen said\r\nthat when the Decembrists were withdrawn from circulation the average\r\nlevel of our society sank. I should think so, indeed. Then Herzen\r\nhimself and his fellows were withdrawn; now is the turn of the\r\nNeveroffs."\r\n\r\n"They can\'t all be got rid off," said Nabatoff, in his cheerful tones.\r\n"There will always be left enough to continue the breed. No, there\r\nwon\'t, if we show any pity to _them_ there," Nabatoff said, raising his\r\nvoice; and not letting himself be interrupted, "Give me a cigarette."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Anatole, it is not good for you," said Mary Pavlovna. "Please do\r\nnot smoke."\r\n\r\n"Oh, leave me alone," he said angrily, and lit a cigarette, but at once\r\nbegan to cough and to retch, as if he were going to be sick. Having\r\ncleared his throat though, he went on:\r\n\r\n"What we have been doing is not the thing at all. Not to argue, but for\r\nall to unite--to destroy them--that\'s it."\r\n\r\n"But _they_ are also human beings," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No, _they_ are not human, they who can do what they are\r\ndoing--No--There, now, I heard that some kind of bombs and balloons have\r\nbeen invented. Well, one ought to go up in such a balloon and sprinkle\r\nbombs down on _them_ as if _they_ were bugs, until _they_ are all\r\nexterminated--Yes. Because--" he was going to continue, but, flushing\r\nall over, he began coughing worse than before, and a stream of blood\r\nrushed from his mouth.\r\n\r\nNabatoff ran to get ice. Mary Pavlovna brought valerian drops and\r\noffered them to him, but he, breathing quickly and heavily, pushed her\r\naway with his thin, white hand, and kept his eyes closed. When the ice\r\nand cold water had eased Kryltzoff a little, and he had been put to\r\nbed, Nekhludoff, having said good-night to everybody, went out with the\r\nsergeant, who had been waiting for him some time.\r\n\r\nThe criminals were now quiet, and most of them were asleep. Though the\r\npeople were lying on and under the bed shelves and in the space between,\r\nthey could not all be placed inside the rooms, and some of them lay in\r\nthe passage with their sacks under their heads and covered with their\r\ncloaks. The moans and sleepy voices came through the open doors and\r\nsounded through the passage. Everywhere lay compact heaps of human\r\nbeings covered with prison cloaks. Only a few men who were sitting in\r\nthe bachelors\' room by the light of a candle end, which they put out\r\nwhen they noticed the sergeant, were awake, and an old man who sat naked\r\nunder the lamp in the passage picking the vermin off his shirt. The\r\nfoul air in the political prisoners\' rooms seemed pure compared to the\r\nstinking closeness here. The smoking lamp shone dimly as through a mist,\r\nand it was difficult to breathe. Stepping along the passage, one had to\r\nlook carefully for an empty space, and having put down one foot had to\r\nfind place for the other. Three persons, who had evidently found no\r\nroom even in the passage, lay in the anteroom, close to the stinking and\r\nleaking tub. One of these was an old idiot, whom Nekhludoff had often\r\nseen marching with the gang; another was a boy about twelve; he lay\r\nbetween the two other convicts, with his head on the leg of one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen he had passed out of the gate Nekhludoff took a deep breath and\r\nlong continued to breathe in deep draughts of frosty air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nWHY IS IT DONE?\r\n\r\nIt had cleared up and was starlight. Except in a few places the mud was\r\nfrozen hard when Nekhludoff returned to his inn and knocked at one of\r\nits dark windows. The broad-shouldered labourer came barefooted to open\r\nthe door for him and let him in. Through a door on the right, leading\r\nto the back premises, came the loud snoring of the carters, who slept\r\nthere, and the sound of many horses chewing oats came from the yard. The\r\nfront room, where a red lamp was burning in front of the icons, smelt\r\nof wormwood and perspiration, and some one with mighty lungs was snoring\r\nbehind a partition. Nekhludoff undressed, put his leather travelling\r\npillow on the oilcloth sofa, spread out his rug and lay down, thinking\r\nover all he had seen and heard that day; the boy sleeping on the liquid\r\nthat oozed from the stinking tub, with his head on the convict\'s leg,\r\nseemed more dreadful than all else.\r\n\r\nUnexpected and important as his conversation with Simonson and Katusha\r\nthat evening had been, he did not dwell on it; his situation in relation\r\nto that subject was so complicated and indefinite that he drove the\r\nthought from his mind. But the picture of those unfortunate beings,\r\ninhaling the noisome air, and lying in the liquid oozing out of the\r\nstinking tub, especially that of the boy, with his innocent face asleep\r\non the leg of a criminal, came all the more vividly to his mind, and he\r\ncould not get it out of his head.\r\n\r\nTo know that somewhere far away there are men who torture other men\r\nby inflicting all sorts of humiliations and inhuman degradation and\r\nsufferings on them, or for three months incessantly to look on while men\r\nwere inflicting these humiliations and sufferings on other men is a very\r\ndifferent thing. And Nekhludoff felt it. More than once during these\r\nthree months he asked himself, "Am I mad because I see what others do\r\nnot, or are they mad that do these things that I see?"\r\n\r\nYet they (and there were many of them) did what seemed so astonishing\r\nand terrible to him with such quiet assurance that what they were doing\r\nwas necessary and was important and useful work that it was hard to\r\nbelieve they were mad; nor could he, conscious of the clearness of his\r\nthoughts, believe he was mad; and all this kept him continually in a\r\nstate of perplexity.\r\n\r\nThis is how the things he saw during these three months impressed\r\nNekhludoff: From among the people who were free, those were chosen, by\r\nmeans of trials and the administration, who were the most nervous,\r\nthe most hot tempered, the most excitable, the most gifted, and the\r\nstrongest, but the least careful and cunning. These people, not a wit\r\nmore dangerous than many of those who remained free, were first locked\r\nin prisons, transported to Siberia, where they were provided for and\r\nkept months and years in perfect idleness, and away from nature, their\r\nfamilies, and useful work--that is, away from the conditions necessary\r\nfor a natural and moral life. This firstly. Secondly, these people\r\nwere subjected to all sorts of unnecessary indignity in these different\r\nPlaces--chains, shaved heads, shameful clothing--that is, they were\r\ndeprived of the chief motives that induce the weak to live good lives,\r\nthe regard for public opinion, the sense of shame and the consciousness\r\nof human dignity. Thirdly, they were continually exposed to dangers,\r\nsuch as the epidemics so frequent in places of confinement, exhaustion,\r\nflogging, not to mention accidents, such as sunstrokes, drowning or\r\nconflagrations, when the instinct of self-preservation makes even the\r\nkindest, most moral men commit cruel actions, and excuse such actions\r\nwhen committed by others.\r\n\r\nFourthly, these people were forced to associate with others who\r\nwere particularly depraved by life, and especially by these very\r\ninstitutions--rakes, murderers and villains--who act on those who are\r\nnot yet corrupted by the measures inflicted on them as leaven acts on\r\ndough.\r\n\r\nAnd, fifthly, the fact that all sorts of violence, cruelty, inhumanity,\r\nare not only tolerated, but even permitted by the government, when it\r\nsuits its purposes, was impressed on them most forcibly by the inhuman\r\ntreatment they were subjected to; by the sufferings inflicted on\r\nchildren, women and old men; by floggings with rods and whips; by\r\nrewards offered for bringing a fugitive back, dead or alive; by the\r\nseparation of husbands and wives, and the uniting them with the wives\r\nand husbands of others for sexual intercourse; by shooting or hanging\r\nthem. To those who were deprived of their freedom, who were in want\r\nand misery, acts of violence were evidently still more permissible.\r\nAll these institutions seemed purposely invented for the production of\r\ndepravity and vice, condensed to such a degree that no other conditions\r\ncould produce it, and for the spreading of this condensed depravity and\r\nvice broadcast among the whole population.\r\n\r\n"Just as if a problem had been set to find the best, the surest means\r\nof depraving the greatest number of persons," thought Nekhludoff, while\r\ninvestigating the deeds that were being done in the prisons and halting\r\nstations. Every year hundreds of thousands were brought to the highest\r\npitch of depravity, and when completely depraved they were set free to\r\ncarry the depravity they had caught in prison among the people. In\r\nthe prisons of Tamen, Ekaterinburg, Tomsk and at the halting stations\r\nNekhludoff saw how successfully the object society seemed to have set\r\nitself was attained.\r\n\r\nOrdinary, simple men with a conception of the demands of the social and\r\nChristian Russian peasant morality lost this conception, and found a\r\nnew one, founded chiefly on the idea that any outrage or violence was\r\njustifiable if it seemed profitable. After living in a prison those\r\npeople became conscious with the whole of their being that, judging by\r\nwhat was happening to themselves, all the moral laws, the respect and\r\nthe sympathy for others which church and the moral teachers preach,\r\nwas really set aside, and that, therefore, they, too, need not keep the\r\nlaws. Nekhludoff noticed the effects of prison life on all the convicts\r\nhe knew--on Fedoroff, on Makar, and even on Taras, who, after two months\r\namong the convicts, struck Nekhludoff by the want of morality in his\r\narguments. Nekhludoff found out during his journey how tramps, escaping\r\ninto the marshes, persuade a comrade to escape with them, and then kill\r\nhim and feed on his flesh. (He saw a living man who was accused of this\r\nand acknowledged the fact.) And the most terrible part was that this was\r\nnot a solitary, but a recurring case.\r\n\r\nOnly by a special cultivation of vice, such as was perpetrated in these\r\nestablishments, could a Russian be brought to the state of this tramp,\r\nwho excelled Nietzsche\'s newest teaching, and held that everything was\r\npossible and nothing forbidden, and who spread this teaching first among\r\nthe convicts and then among the people in general.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation of all that was being done was the wish to put\r\na stop to crime by fear, by correction, by lawful vengeance as it was\r\nwritten in the books. But in reality nothing in the least resembling any\r\nof these results came to pass. Instead of vice being put a stop to, it\r\nonly spread further; instead of being frightened, the criminals were\r\nencouraged (many a tramp returned to prison of his own free will).\r\nInstead of being corrected, every kind of vice was systematically\r\ninstilled, while the desire for vengeance did not weaken by the measures\r\nof the government, but was bred in the people who had none of it.\r\n\r\n"Then why is it done?" Nekhludoff asked himself, but could find no\r\nanswer. And what seemed most surprising was that all this was not being\r\ndone accidentally, not by mistake, not once, but that it had continued\r\nfor centuries, with this difference only, that at first the people\'s\r\nnostrils used to be torn and their ears cut off; then they were branded,\r\nand now they were manacled and transported by steam instead of on the\r\nold carts. The arguments brought forward by those in government service,\r\nwho said that the things which aroused his indignation were simply due\r\nto the imperfect arrangements of the places of confinement, and that\r\nthey could all be put to rights if prisons of a modern type were built,\r\ndid not satisfy Nekhludoff, because he knew that what revolted him was\r\nnot the consequence of a better or worse arrangement of the prisons.\r\nHe had read of model prisons with electric bells, of executions by\r\nelectricity, recommended by Tard; but this refined kind of violence\r\nrevolted him even more.\r\n\r\nBut what revolted Nekhludoff most was that there were men in the law\r\ncourts and in the ministry who received large salaries, taken from the\r\npeople, for referring to books written by men like themselves and with\r\nlike motives, and sorting actions that violated laws made by themselves\r\naccording to different statutes; and, in obedience to these statutes,\r\nsending those guilty of such actions to places where they were\r\ncompletely at the mercy of cruel, hardened inspectors, jailers, convoy\r\nsoldiers, where millions of them perished body and soul.\r\n\r\nNow that he had a closer knowledge of prisons, Nekhludoff found out\r\nthat all those vices which developed among the prisoners--drunkenness,\r\ngambling, cruelty, and all these terrible crimes, even cannibalism--were\r\nnot casual, or due to degeneration or to the existence of monstrosities\r\nof the criminal type, as science, going hand in hand with the\r\ngovernment, explained it, but an unavoidable consequence of the\r\nincomprehensible delusion that men may punish one another. Nekhludoff\r\nsaw that cannibalism did not commence in the marshes, but in the\r\nministry. He saw that his brother-in-law, for example, and, in fact, all\r\nthe lawyers and officials, from the usher to the minister, do not care\r\nin the least for justice or the good of the people about whom they\r\nspoke, but only for the roubles they were paid for doing the things that\r\nwere the source whence all this degradation and suffering flowed. This\r\nwas quite evident.\r\n\r\n"Can it be, then, that all this is done simply through misapprehension?\r\nCould it not be managed that all these officials should have their\r\nsalaries secured to them, and a premium paid them, besides, so that\r\nthey should leave off, doing all that they were doing now?" Nekhludoff\r\nthought, and in spite of the fleas, that seemed to spring up round him\r\nlike water from a fountain whenever he moved, he fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY RESUMED.\r\n\r\nThe carters had left the inn long before Nekhludoff awoke. The landlady\r\nhad had her tea, and came in wiping her fat, perspiring neck with\r\nher handkerchief, and said that a soldier had brought a note from\r\nthe halting station. The note was from Mary Pavlovna. She wrote that\r\nKryltzoff\'s attack was more serious than they had imagined. "We wished\r\nhim to be left behind and to remain with him, but this has not been\r\nallowed, so that we shall take him on; but we fear the worst. Please\r\narrange so that if he should be left in the next town, one of us might\r\nremain with him. If in order to get the permission to stay I should be\r\nobliged to get married to him, I am of course ready to do so."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sent the young labourer to the post station to order horses\r\nand began packing up hurriedly. Before he had drunk his second tumbler\r\nof tea the three-horsed postcart drove up to the porch with ringing\r\nbells, the wheels rattling on the frozen mud as on stones. Nekhludoff\r\npaid the fat-necked landlady, hurried out and got into the cart,\r\nand gave orders to the driver to go on as fast as possible, so as to\r\novertake the gang. Just past the gates of the commune pasture ground\r\nthey did overtake the carts, loaded with sacks and the sick prisoners,\r\nas they rattled over the frozen mud, that was just beginning to be\r\nrolled smooth by the wheels (the officer was not there, he had gone in\r\nadvance). The soldiers, who had evidently been drinking, followed by the\r\nside of the road, chatting merrily. There were a great many carts. In\r\neach of the first carts sat six invalid criminal convicts, close packed.\r\nOn each of the last two were three political prisoners. Novodvoroff,\r\nGrabetz and Kondratieff sat on one, Rintzeva, Nabatoff and the woman to\r\nwhom Mary Pavlovna had given up her own place on the other, and on one\r\nof the carts lay Kryltzoff on a heap of hay, with a pillow under his\r\nhead, and Mary Pavlovna sat by him on the edge of the cart. Nekhludoff\r\nordered his driver to stop, got out and went up to Kryltzoff. One of\r\nthe tipsy soldiers waved his hand towards Nekhludoff, but he paid no\r\nattention and started walking by Kryltzoff\'s side, holding on to the\r\nside of the cart with his hand. Dressed in a sheepskin coat, with a fur\r\ncap on his head and his mouth bound up with a handkerchief, he seemed\r\npaler and thinner than ever. His beautiful eyes looked very large and\r\nbrilliant. Shaken from side to side by the jottings of the cart, he lay\r\nwith his eyes fixed on Nekhludoff; but when asked about his health, he\r\nonly closed his eyes and angrily shook his head. All his energy seemed\r\nto be needed in order to bear the jolting of the cart. Mary Pavlovna was\r\non the other side. She exchanged a significant glance with Nekhludoff,\r\nwhich expressed all her anxiety about Kryltzoff\'s state, and then began\r\nto talk at once in a cheerful manner.\r\n\r\n"It seems the officer is ashamed of himself," she shouted, so as to be\r\nheard above the rattle of the wheels. "Bousovkin\'s manacles have\r\nbeen removed, and he is carrying his little girl himself. Katusha and\r\nSimonson are with him, and Vera, too. She has taken my place."\r\n\r\nKryltzoff said something that could not be heard because of the noise,\r\nand frowning in the effort to repress his cough shook his head. Then\r\nNekhludoff stooped towards him, so as to hear, and Kryltzoff, freeing\r\nhis mouth of the handkerchief, whispered:\r\n\r\n"Much better now. Only not to catch cold."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff nodded in acquiescence, and again exchanged a glance with\r\nMary Pavlovna.\r\n\r\n"How about the problem of the three bodies?" whispered Kryltzoff,\r\nsmiling with great difficulty. "The solution is difficult."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff did not understand, but Mary Pavlovna explained that he meant\r\nthe well-known mathematical problem which defined the position of the\r\nsun, moon and earth, which Kryltzoff compared to the relations between\r\nNekhludoff, Katusha and Simonson. Kryltzoff nodded, to show that Mary\r\nPavlovna had explained his joke correctly.\r\n\r\n"The decision does not lie with me," Nekhludoff said.\r\n\r\n"Did you get my note? Will you do it?" Mary Pavlovna asked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," answered Nekhludoff; and noticing a look of displeasure on\r\nKryltzoff\'s face, he returned to his conveyance, and holding with both\r\nhands to the sides of the cart, got in, which jolted with him over the\r\nruts of the rough road. He passed the gang, which, with its grey cloaks\r\nand sheepskin coats, chains and manacles, stretched over three-quarters\r\nof a mile of the road. On the opposite side of the road Nekhludoff\r\nnoticed Katusha\'s blue shawl, Vera Doukhova\'s black coat, and Simonson\'s\r\ncrochet cap, white worsted stockings, with bands, like those of sandals,\r\ntied round him. Simonson was walking with the woman and carrying on a\r\nheated discussion.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw Nekhludoff they bowed to him, and Simonson raised his hat\r\nin a solemn manner. Nekhludoff, having nothing to say, did not stop, and\r\nwas soon ahead of the carts. Having got again on to a smoother part of\r\nthe road, they drove still more quickly, but they had continually to\r\nturn aside to let pass long rows of carts that were moving along the\r\nroad in both directions.\r\n\r\nThe road, which was cut up by deep ruts, lay through a thick pine\r\nforest, mingled with birch trees and larches, bright with yellow leaves\r\nthey had not yet shed. By the time Nekhludoff had passed about half the\r\ngang he reached the end of the forest. Fields now lay stretched along\r\nboth sides of the road, and the crosses and cupolas of a monastery\r\nappeared in the distance. The clouds had dispersed, and it had cleared\r\nup completely; the leaves, the frozen puddles and the gilt crosses and\r\ncupolas of the monastery glittered brightly in the sun that had risen\r\nabove the forest. A little to the right mountains began to gleam white\r\nin the blue-grey distance, and the trap entered a large village.\r\nThe village street was full of people, both Russians and other\r\nnationalities, wearing peculiar caps and cloaks. Tipsy men and women\r\ncrowded and chattered round booths, traktirs, public houses and carts.\r\nThe vicinity of a town was noticeable. Giving a pull and a lash of the\r\nwhip to the horse on his right, the driver sat down sideways on the\r\nright edge of the seat, so that the reins hung over that side, and with\r\nevident desire of showing off, he drove quickly down to the river, which\r\nhad to be crossed by a ferry. The raft was coming towards them, and\r\nhad reached the middle of the river. About twenty carts were waiting to\r\ncross. Nekhludoff had not long to wait. The raft, which had been pulled\r\nfar up the stream, quickly approached the landing, carried by the swift\r\nwaters. The tall, silent, broad-shouldered, muscular ferryman, dressed\r\nin sheepskins, threw the ropes and moored the raft with practised hand,\r\nlanded the carts that were on it, and put those that were waiting on\r\nthe bank on board. The whole raft was filled with vehicles and horses\r\nshuffling at the sight of the water. The broad, swift river splashed\r\nagainst the sides of the ferryboats, tightening their moorings.\r\n\r\nWhen the raft was full, and Nekhludoff\'s cart, with the horses taken out\r\nof it, stood closely surrounded by other carts on the side of the raft,\r\nthe ferryman barred the entrance, and, paying no heed to the prayers of\r\nthose who had not found room in the raft, unfastened the ropes and set\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAll was quiet on the raft; one could hear nothing but the tramp of the\r\nferryman\'s boots and the horses changing from foot to foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n"JUST A WORTHLESS TRAMP."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff stood on the edge of the raft looking at the broad river. Two\r\npictures kept rising up in his mind. One, that of Kryltzoff, unprepared\r\nfor death and dying, made a heavy, sorrowful impression on him. The\r\nother, that of Katusha, full of energy, having gained the love of such a\r\nman as Simonson, and found a true and solid path towards righteousness,\r\nshould have been pleasant, yet it also created a heavy impression on\r\nNekhludoff\'s mind, and he could not conquer this impression.\r\n\r\nThe vibrating sounds of a big brass bell reached them from the town.\r\nNekhludoff\'s driver, who stood by his side, and the other men on the\r\nraft raised their caps and crossed themselves, all except a short,\r\ndishevelled old man, who stood close to the railway and whom Nekhludoff\r\nhad not noticed before. He did not cross himself, but raised his head\r\nand looked at Nekhludoff. This old man wore a patched coat, cloth\r\ntrousers and worn and patched shoes. He had a small wallet on his back,\r\nand a high fur cap with the fur much rubbed on his head.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you pray, old chap?" asked Nekhludoff\'s driver as he replaced\r\nand straightened his cap. "Are you unbaptized?"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s one to pray to?" asked the old man quickly, in a determinately\r\naggressive tone.\r\n\r\n"To whom? To God, of course," said the driver sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"And you just show me where he is, that god." There was something so\r\nserious and firm in the expression of the old man, that the driver felt\r\nthat he had to do with a strong-minded man, and was a bit abashed. And\r\ntrying not to show this, not to be silenced, and not to be put to shame\r\nbefore the crowd that was observing them, he answered quickly.\r\n\r\n"Where? In heaven, of course."\r\n\r\n"And have you been up there?"\r\n\r\n"Whether I\'ve been or not, every one knows that you must pray to God."\r\n\r\n"No one has ever seen God at any time. The only begotten Son who is in\r\nthe bosom of the Father he hath declared him," said the old man in the\r\nsame rapid manner, and with a severe frown on his brow.\r\n\r\n"It\'s clear you are not a Christian, but a hole worshipper. You pray\r\nto a hole," said the driver, shoving the handle of his whip into his\r\ngirdle, pulling straight the harness on one of the horses.\r\n\r\nSome one laughed.\r\n\r\n"What is your faith, Dad?" asked a middle-aged man, who stood by his\r\ncart on the same side of the raft.\r\n\r\n"I have no kind of faith, because I believe no one--no one but myself,"\r\nsaid the old man as quickly and decidedly as before.\r\n\r\n"How can you believe yourself?" Nekhludoff asked, entering into a\r\nconversation with him. "You might make a mistake."\r\n\r\n"Never in your life," the old man said decidedly, with a toss of his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"Then why are there different faiths?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just because men believe others and do not believe themselves that\r\nthere are different faiths. I also believed others, and lost myself as\r\nin a swamp,--lost myself so that I had no hope of finding my way out.\r\nOld believers and new believers and Judaisers and Khlysty and Popovitzy,\r\nand Bespopovitzy and Avstriaks and Molokans and Skoptzy--every faith\r\npraises itself only, and so they all creep about like blind puppies.\r\nThere are many faiths, but the spirit is one--in me and in you and in\r\nhim. So that if every one believes himself all will be united. Every one\r\nbe himself, and all will be as one."\r\n\r\nThe old man spoke loudly and often looked round, evidently wishing that\r\nas many as possible should hear him.\r\n\r\n"And have you long held this faith?"\r\n\r\n"I? A long time. This is the twenty-third year that they persecute me."\r\n\r\n"Persecute you? How?"\r\n\r\n"As they persecuted Christ, so they persecute me. They seize me, and\r\ntake me before the courts and before the priests, the Scribes and the\r\nPharisees. Once they put me into a madhouse; but they can do nothing\r\nbecause I am free. They say, \'What is your name?\' thinking I shall name\r\nmyself. But I do not give myself a name. I have given up everything:\r\nI have no name, no place, no country, nor anything. I am just myself.\r\n\'What is your name?\' \'Man.\' \'How old are you?\' I say, \'I do not count my\r\nyears and cannot count them, because I always was, I always shall be.\'\r\n\'Who are your parents?\' \'I have no parents except God and Mother Earth.\r\nGod is my father.\' \'And the Tsar? Do you recognise the Tsar?\' they say.\r\nI say, \'Why not? He is his own Tsar, and I am my own Tsar.\' \'Where\'s the\r\ngood of talking to him,\' they say, and I say, \'I do not ask you to talk\r\nto me.\' And so they begin tormenting me."\r\n\r\n"And where are you going now?" asked Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Where God will lead me. I work when I can find work, and when I can\'t\r\nI beg." The old man noticed that the raft was approaching the bank and\r\nstopped, looking round at the bystanders with a look of triumph.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff got out his purse and offered some money to the old man, but\r\nhe refused, saying:\r\n\r\n"I do not accept this sort of thing--bread I do accept."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, excuse me."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to excuse, you have not offended me. And it is not\r\npossible to offend me." And the old man put the wallet he had taken\r\noff again on his back. Meanwhile, the post-cart had been landed and the\r\nhorses harnessed.\r\n\r\n"I wonder you should care to talk to him, sir," said the driver, when\r\nNekhludoff, having tipped the bowing ferryman, got into the cart again.\r\n"He is just a worthless tramp."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nNEKHLUDOFF SEES THE GENERAL.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the top of the hill bank the driver turned to\r\nNekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"Which hotel am I to drive to?"\r\n\r\n"Which is the best?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing could be better than the Siberian, but Dukeoff\'s is also good."\r\n\r\n"Drive to whichever you like."\r\n\r\nThe driver again seated himself sideways and drove faster. The town\r\nwas like all such towns. The same kind of houses with attic windows\r\nand green roofs, the same kind of cathedral, the same kind of shops and\r\nstores in the principal street, and even the same kind of policemen.\r\nOnly the houses were almost all of them wooden, and the streets were not\r\npaved. In one of the chief streets the driver stopped at the door of an\r\nhotel, but there was no room to be had, so he drove to another. And here\r\nNekhludoff, after two months, found himself once again in surroundings\r\nsuch as he had been accustomed to as far as comfort and cleanliness\r\nwent. Though the room he was shown to was simple enough, yet Nekhludoff\r\nfelt greatly relieved to be there after two months of post-carts,\r\ncountry inns and halting stations. His first business was to clean\r\nhimself of the lice which he had never been able to get thoroughly rid\r\nof after visiting a halting station. When he had unpacked he went to the\r\nRussian bath, after which he made himself fit to be seen in a town,\r\nput on a starched shirt, trousers that had got rather creased along the\r\nseams, a frock-coat and an overcoat, and drove to the Governor of the\r\ndistrict. The hotel-keeper called an isvostchik, whose well-fed Kirghiz\r\nhorse and vibrating trap soon brought Nekhludoff to the large porch of\r\na big building, in front of which stood sentinels and a policeman. The\r\nhouse had a garden in front, and at the back, among the naked branches\r\nof aspen and birch trees, there grew thick and dark green pines and\r\nfirs. The General was not well, and did not receive; but Nekhludoff\r\nasked the footman to hand in his card all the same, and the footman came\r\nback with a favourable reply.\r\n\r\n"You are asked to come in."\r\n\r\nThe hall, the footman, the orderly, the staircase, the dancing-room,\r\nwith its well-polished floor, were very much the same as in Petersburg,\r\nonly more imposing and rather dirtier. Nekhludoff was shown into the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nThe General, a bloated, potato-nosed man, with a sanguine disposition,\r\nlarge bumps on his forehead, bald head, and puffs under his eyes, sat\r\nwrapped in a Tartar silk dressing-gown smoking a cigarette and sipping\r\nhis tea out of a tumbler in a silver holder.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, sir? Excuse my dressing-gown; it is better so than if I\r\nhad not received you at all," he said, pulling up his dressing-gown over\r\nhis fat neck with its deep folds at the nape. "I am not quite well, and\r\ndo not go out. What has brought you to our remote region?"\r\n\r\n"I am accompanying a gang of prisoners, among whom there is a person\r\nclosely connected with me, said Nekhludoff, and now I have come to\r\nsee your Excellency partly in behalf of this person, and partly about\r\nanother business." The General took a whiff and a sip of tea, put\r\nhis cigarette into a malachite ashpan, with his narrow eyes fixed on\r\nNekhludoff, listening seriously. He only interrupted him once to offer\r\nhim a cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe General belonged to the learned type of military men who believed\r\nthat liberal and humane views can be reconciled with their profession.\r\nBut being by nature a kind and intelligent man, he soon felt the\r\nimpossibility of such a reconciliation; so as not to feel the inner\r\ndiscord in which he was living, he gave himself up more and more to the\r\nhabit of drinking, which is so widely spread among military men, and\r\nwas now suffering from what doctors term alcoholism. He was imbued\r\nwith alcohol, and if he drank any kind of liquor it made him tipsy. Yet\r\nstrong drink was an absolute necessity to him, he could not live without\r\nit, so he was quite drunk every evening; but had grown so used to this\r\nstate that he did not reel nor talk any special nonsense. And if he\r\ndid talk nonsense, it was accepted as words of wisdom because of the\r\nimportant and high position which he occupied. Only in the morning, just\r\nat the time Nekhludoff came to see him, he was like a reasonable being,\r\ncould understand what was said to him, and fulfil more or less aptly a\r\nproverb he was fond of repeating: "He\'s tipsy, but he\'s wise, so he\'s\r\npleasant in two ways."\r\n\r\nThe higher authorities knew he was a drunkard, but he was more educated\r\nthan the rest, though his education had stopped at the spot where\r\ndrunkenness had got hold of him. He was bold, adroit, of imposing\r\nappearance, and showed tact even when tipsy; therefore, he was\r\nappointed, and was allowed to retain so public and responsible an\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff told him that the person he was interested in was a woman,\r\nthat she was sentenced, though innocent, and that a petition had been\r\nsent to the Emperor in her behalf.\r\n\r\n"Yes, well?" said the General.\r\n\r\n"I was promised in Petersburg that the news concerning her fate should\r\nbe sent to me not later than this month and to this place-"\r\n\r\nThe General stretched his hand with its stumpy fingers towards the\r\ntable, and rang a bell, still looking at Nekhludoff and puffing at his\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\n"So I would like to ask you that this woman should be allowed to remain\r\nhere until the answer to her petition comes."\r\n\r\nThe footman, an orderly in uniform, came in.\r\n\r\n"Ask if Anna Vasilievna is up," said the General to the orderly, "and\r\nbring some more tea." Then, turning to Nekhludoff, "Yes, and what else?"\r\n\r\n"My other request concerns a political prisoner who is with the same\r\ngang."\r\n\r\n"Dear me," said the General, with a significant shake of the head.\r\n\r\n"He is seriously ill--dying, and he will probably be left here in the\r\nhospital, so one of the women prisoners would like to stay behind with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"She is no relation of his?"\r\n\r\n"No, but she is willing to marry him if that will enable her to remain\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\nThe General looked fixedly with twinkling eyes at his interlocutor, and,\r\nevidently with a wish to discomfit him, listened, smoking in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff had finished, the General took a book off the table,\r\nand, wetting his finger, quickly turned over the pages and found the\r\nstatute relating to marriage.\r\n\r\n"What is she sentenced to?" he asked, looking up from the book.\r\n\r\n"She? To hard labour."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, the position of one sentenced to that cannot be bettered by\r\nmarriage."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but--"\r\n\r\n"Excuse me. Even if a free man should marry her, she would have to\r\nserve her term. The question in such cases is, whose is the heavier\r\npunishment, hers or his?"\r\n\r\n"They are both sentenced to hard labour."\r\n\r\n"Very well; so they are quits," said the General, with a laugh. "She\'s\r\ngot what he has, only as he is sick he may be left behind, and of course\r\nwhat can be done to lighten his fate shall be done. But as for her, even\r\nif she did marry him, she could not remain behind."\r\n\r\n"The Generaless is having her coffee," the footman announced.\r\n\r\nThe General nodded and continued:\r\n\r\n"However, I shall think about it. What are their names? Put them down\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff wrote down the names.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff\'s request to be allowed to see the dying man the General\r\nanswered by saying, "Neither can I do that. Of course I do not suspect\r\nyou, but you take an interest in him and in the others, and you have\r\nmoney, and here with us anything can be done with money. I have been\r\ntold to put down bribery. But how can I put down bribery when everybody\r\ntakes bribes? And the lower their rank the more ready they are to be\r\nbribed. How can one find it out across more than three thousand miles?\r\nThere any official is a little Tsar, just as I am here," and he laughed.\r\n"You have in all likelihood been to see the political prisoners; you\r\ngave money and got permission to see them," he said, with a smile. "Is\r\nit not so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is."\r\n\r\n"I quite understand that you had to do it. You pity a political prisoner\r\nand wish to see him. And the inspector or the convoy soldier accepts,\r\nbecause he has a salary of twice twenty copecks and a family, and he\r\ncan\'t help accepting it. In his place and yours I should have acted\r\nin the same way as you and he did. But in my position I do not permit\r\nmyself to swerve an inch from the letter of the law, just because I am\r\na man, and might be influenced by pity. But I am a member of the\r\nexecutive, and I have been placed in a position of trust on certain\r\nconditions, and these conditions I must carry out. Well, so this\r\nbusiness is finished. And now let us hear what is going on in the\r\nmetropolis." And the General began questioning with the evident desire\r\nto hear the news and to show how very human he was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SENTENCE COMMUTED.\r\n\r\n"By-the-way, where are you staying?" asked the General as he was taking\r\nleave of Nekhludoff. "At Duke\'s? Well, it\'s horrid enough there. Come\r\nand dine with us at five o\'clock. You speak English?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good. You see, an English traveller has just arrived here. He\r\nis studying the question of transportation and examining the prisons of\r\nSiberia. Well, he is dining with us to-night, and you come and meet him.\r\nWe dine at five, and my wife expects punctuality. Then I shall also\r\ngive you an answer what to do about that woman, and perhaps it may be\r\npossible to leave some one behind with the sick prisoner."\r\n\r\nHaving made his bow to the General, Nekhludoff drove to the post-office,\r\nfeeling himself in an extremely animated and energetic frame of mind.\r\n\r\nThe post-office was a low-vaulted room. Several officials sat behind\r\na counter serving the people, of whom there was quite a crowd. One\r\nofficial sat with his head bent to one side and kept stamping the\r\nenvelopes, which he slipped dexterously under the stamp. Nekhludoff had\r\nnot long to wait. As soon as he had given his name, everything that had\r\ncome for him by post was at once handed to him. There was a good deal:\r\nletters, and money, and books, and the last number of Fatherland Notes.\r\nNekhludoff took all these things to a wooden bench, on which a soldier\r\nwith a book in his hand sat waiting for something, took the seat by\r\nhis side, and began sorting the letters. Among them was one registered\r\nletter in a fine envelope, with a distinctly stamped bright red seal. He\r\nbroke the seal, and seeing a letter from Selenin and some official paper\r\ninside the envelope, he felt the blood rush to his face, and his heart\r\nstood still. It was the answer to Katusha\'s petition. What would that\r\nanswer be? Nekhludoff glanced hurriedly through the letter, written\r\nin an illegibly small, hard, and cramped hand, and breathed a sigh of\r\nrelief. The answer was a favourable one.\r\n\r\n"Dear friend," wrote Selenin, "our last talk has made a profound\r\nimpression on me. You were right concerning Maslova. I looked carefully\r\nthrough the case, and see that shocking injustice has been done her. It\r\ncould be remedied only by the Committee of Petitions before which you\r\nlaid it. I managed to assist at the examination of the case, and I\r\nenclose herewith the copy of the mitigation of the sentence. Your aunt,\r\nthe Countess Katerina Ivanovna, gave me the address which I am sending\r\nthis to. The original document has been sent to the place where she was\r\nimprisoned before her trial, and will from there he probably sent\r\nat once to the principal Government office in Siberia. I hasten to\r\ncommunicate this glad news to you and warmly press your hand.\r\n\r\n                    "Yours,\r\n\r\n                        "SELENIN."\r\n\r\nThe document ran thus: "His Majesty\'s office for the reception\r\nof petitions, addressed to his Imperial name"--here followed the\r\ndate----"by order of the chief of his Majesty\'s office for the reception\r\nof petitions addressed to his Imperial name. The meschanka Katerina\r\nMaslova is hereby informed that his Imperial Majesty, with reference to\r\nher most loyal petition, condescending to her request, deigns to order\r\nthat her sentence to hard labour should be commuted to one of exile to\r\nthe less distant districts of Siberia."\r\n\r\nThis was joyful and important news; all that Nekhludoff could have hoped\r\nfor Katusha, and for himself also, had happened. It was true that the\r\nnew position she was in brought new complications with it. While she was\r\na convict, marriage with her could only be fictitious, and would have\r\nhad no meaning except that he would have been in a position to alleviate\r\nher condition. And now there was nothing to prevent their living\r\ntogether, and Nekhludoff had not prepared himself for that. And,\r\nbesides, what of her relations to Simonson? What was the meaning of her\r\nwords yesterday? If she consented to a union with Simonson, would it\r\nbe well? He could not unravel all these questions, and gave up thinking\r\nabout it. "It will all clear itself up later on," he thought; "I must\r\nnot think about it now, but convey the glad news to her as soon as\r\npossible, and set her free." He thought that the copy of the document he\r\nhad received would suffice, so when he left the post-office he told the\r\nisvostchik to drive him to the prison.\r\n\r\nThough he had received no order from the governor to visit the prison\r\nthat morning, he knew by experience that it was easy to get from the\r\nsubordinates what the higher officials would not grant, so now he meant\r\nto try and get into the prison to bring Katusha the joyful news, and\r\nperhaps to get her set free, and at the same time to inquire about\r\nKryltzoff\'s state of health, and tell him and Mary Pavlovna what the\r\ngeneral had said. The prison inspector was a tall, imposing-looking man,\r\nwith moustaches and whiskers that twisted towards the corners of his\r\nmouth. He received Nekhludoff very gravely, and told him plainly that\r\nhe could not grant an outsider the permission to interview the prisoners\r\nwithout a special order from his chief. To Nekhludoff\'s remark that he\r\nhad been allowed to visit the prisoners even in the cities he answered:\r\n\r\n"That may be so, but I do not allow it," and his tone implied, "You\r\ncity gentlemen may think to surprise and perplex us, but we in Eastern\r\nSiberia also know what the law is, and may even teach it you." The copy\r\nof a document straight from the Emperor\'s own office did not have any\r\neffect on the prison inspector either. He decidedly refused to let\r\nNekhludoff come inside the prison walls. He only smiled contemptuously\r\nat Nekhludoff\'s naive conclusion, that the copy he had received would\r\nsuffice to set Maslova free, and declared that a direct order from his\r\nown superiors would be needed before any one could be set at liberty.\r\nThe only things he agreed to do were to communicate to Maslova that a\r\nmitigation had arrived for her, and to promise that he would not detain\r\nher an hour after the order from his chief to liberate her would arrive.\r\nHe would also give no news of Kryltzoff, saying he could not even tell\r\nif there was such a prisoner; and so Nekhludoff, having accomplished\r\nnext to nothing, got into his trap and drove back to his hotel.\r\n\r\nThe strictness of the inspector was chiefly due to the fact that an\r\nepidemic of typhus had broken out in the prison, owing to twice the\r\nnumber of persons that it was intended for being crowded in it. The\r\nisvostchik who drove Nekhludoff said, "Quite a lot of people are dying\r\nin the prison every day, some kind of disease having sprung up among\r\nthem, so that as many as twenty were buried in one day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL\'S HOUSEHOLD.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his ineffectual attempt at the prison, Nekhludoff, still\r\nin the same vigorous, energetic frame of mind, went to the Governor\'s\r\noffice to see if the original of the document had arrived for Maslova.\r\nIt had not arrived, so Nekhludoff went back to the hotel and wrote\r\nwithout delay to Selenin and the advocate about it. When he had\r\nfinished writing he looked at his watch and saw it was time to go to the\r\nGeneral\'s dinner party.\r\n\r\nOn the way he again began wondering how Katusha would receive the news\r\nof the mitigation of her sentence. Where she would be settled? How he\r\nshould live with her? What about Simonson? What would his relations to\r\nher be? He remembered the change that had taken place in her, and\r\nthis reminded him of her past. "I must forget it for the present," he\r\nthought, and again hastened to drive her out of his mind. "When the time\r\ncomes I shall see," he said to himself, and began to think of what he\r\nought to say to the General.\r\n\r\nThe dinner at the General\'s, with the luxury habitual to the lives\r\nof the wealthy and those of high rank, to which Nekhludoff had been\r\naccustomed, was extremely enjoyable after he had been so long deprived\r\nnot only of luxury but even of the most ordinary comforts. The mistress\r\nof the house was a Petersburg grande dame of the old school, a maid of\r\nhonour at the court of Nicholas I., who spoke French quite naturally and\r\nRussian very unnaturally. She held herself very erect and, moving her\r\nhands, she kept her elbows close to her waist. She was quietly and,\r\nsomewhat sadly considerate for her husband, and extremely kind to\r\nall her visitors, though with a tinge of difference in her behaviour\r\naccording to their position. She received Nekhludoff as if he were one\r\nof them, and her fine, almost imperceptible flattery made him once again\r\naware of his virtues and gave him a feeling of satisfaction. She made\r\nhim feel that she knew of that honest though rather singular step of his\r\nwhich had brought him to Siberia, and held him to be an exceptional man.\r\nThis refined flattery and the elegance and luxury of the General\'s house\r\nhad the effect of making Nekhludoff succumb to the enjoyment of the\r\nhandsome surroundings, the delicate dishes and the ease and pleasure\r\nof intercourse with educated people of his own class, so that the\r\nsurroundings in the midst of which he had lived for the last months\r\nseemed a dream from which he had awakened to reality. Besides those\r\nof the household, the General\'s daughter and her husband and an\r\naide-de-camp, there were an Englishman, a merchant interested in gold\r\nmines, and the governor of a distant Siberian town. All these people\r\nseemed pleasant to Nekhludoff. The Englishman, a healthy man with a\r\nrosy complexion, who spoke very bad French, but whose command of his own\r\nlanguage was very good and oratorically impressive, who had seen a great\r\ndeal, was very interesting to listen to when he spoke about America,\r\nIndia, Japan and Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe young merchant interested in the gold mines, the son of a peasant,\r\nwhose evening dress was made in London, who had diamond studs to his\r\nshirt, possessed a fine library, contributed freely to philanthropic\r\nwork, and held liberal European views, seemed pleasant to Nekhludoff\r\nas a sample of a quite new and good type of civilised European culture,\r\ngrafted on a healthy, uncultivated peasant stem.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the distant Siberian town was that same man who had been\r\nso much talked about in Petersburg at the time Nekhludoff was there. He\r\nwas plump, with thin, curly hair, soft blue eyes, carefully-tended white\r\nhands, with rings on the fingers, a pleasant smile, and very big in the\r\nlower part of his body. The master of the house valued this governor\r\nbecause of all the officials he was the only one who would not be\r\nbribed. The mistress of the house, who was very fond of music and a\r\nvery good pianist herself, valued him because he was a good musician and\r\nplayed duets with her.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was in such good humour that even this man was not unpleasant\r\nto him, in spite of what he knew of his vices. The bright, energetic\r\naide-de-camp, with his bluey grey chin, who was continually offering his\r\nservices, pleased Nekhludoff by his good nature. But it was the charming\r\nyoung couple, the General\'s daughter and her husband, who pleased\r\nNekhludoff best. The daughter was a plain-looking, simple-minded young\r\nwoman, wholly absorbed in her two children. Her husband, whom she had\r\nfallen in love with and married after a long struggle with her parents,\r\nwas a Liberal, who had taken honours at the Moscow University, a modest\r\nand intellectual young man in Government service, who made up statistics\r\nand studied chiefly the foreign tribes, which he liked and tried to save\r\nfrom dying out.\r\n\r\nAll of them were not only kind and attentive to Nekhludoff, but\r\nevidently pleased to see him, as a new and interesting acquaintance. The\r\nGeneral, who came in to dinner in uniform and with a white cross round\r\nhis neck, greeted Nekhludoff as a friend, and asked the visitors to\r\nthe side table to take a glass of vodka and something to whet their\r\nappetites. The General asked Nekhludoff what he had been doing since\r\nhe left that morning, and Nekhludoff told him he had been to the\r\npost-office and received the news of the mitigation of that person\'s\r\nsentence that he had spoken of in the morning, and again asked for a\r\npermission to visit the prison.\r\n\r\nThe General, apparently displeased that business should be mentioned at\r\ndinner, frowned and said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Have a glass of vodka," he said, addressing the Englishman, who had\r\njust come up to the table. The Englishman drank a glass, and said he had\r\nbeen to see the cathedral and the factory, but would like to visit the\r\ngreat transportation prison.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that will just fit in," said the General to Nekhludoff. "You will\r\nbe able to go together. Give them a pass," he added, turning to his\r\naide-de-camp.\r\n\r\n"When would you like to go?" Nekhludoff asked.\r\n\r\n"I prefer visiting the prisons in the evening," the Englishman answered.\r\n"All are indoors and there is no preparation; you find them all as they\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"Ah, he would like to see it in all its glory! Let him do so. I have\r\nwritten about it and no attention has been paid to it. Let him find out\r\nfrom foreign publications," the General said, and went up to the dinner\r\ntable, where the mistress of the house was showing the visitors their\r\nplaces. Nekhludoff sat between his hostess and the Englishman. In front\r\nof him sat the General\'s daughter and the ex-director of the Government\r\ndepartment in Petersburg. The conversation at dinner was carried on by\r\nfits and starts, now it was India that the Englishman talked about, now\r\nthe Tonkin expedition that the General strongly disapproved of, now the\r\nuniversal bribery and corruption in Siberia. All these topics did not\r\ninterest Nekhludoff much.\r\n\r\nBut after dinner, over their coffee, Nekhludoff and the Englishman began\r\na very interesting conversation about Gladstone, and Nekhludoff thought\r\nhe had said many clever things which were noticed by his interlocutor.\r\nAnd Nekhludoff felt it more and more pleasant to be sipping his coffee\r\nseated in an easy-chair among amiable, well-bred people. And when at\r\nthe Englishman\'s request the hostess went up to the piano with the\r\nex-director of the Government department, and they began to play in\r\nwell-practised style Beethoven\'s fifth symphony, Nekhludoff fell into\r\na mental state of perfect self-satisfaction to which he had long been\r\na stranger, as though he had only just found out what a good fellow he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe grand piano was a splendid instrument, the symphony was well\r\nperformed. At least, so it seemed to Nekhludoff, who knew and liked that\r\nsymphony. Listening to the beautiful andante, he felt a tickling in his\r\nnose, he was so touched by his many virtues.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff thanked his hostess for the enjoyment that he had been\r\ndeprived of for so long, and was about to say goodbye and go when the\r\ndaughter of the house came up to him with a determined look and said,\r\nwith a blush, "You asked about my children. Would you like to see them?"\r\n\r\n"She thinks that everybody wants to see her children," said her mother,\r\nsmiling at her daughter\'s winning tactlessness. "The Prince is not at\r\nall interested."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I am very much interested," said Nekhludoff, touched\r\nby this overflowing, happy mother-love. "Please let me see them."\r\n\r\n"She\'s taking the Prince to see her babies," the General shouted,\r\nlaughing from the card-table, where he sat with his son-in-law, the mine\r\nowner and the aide-de-camp. "Go, go, pay your tribute."\r\n\r\nThe young woman, visibly excited by the thought that judgment was about\r\nto be passed on her children, went quickly towards the inner apartments,\r\nfollowed by Nekhludoff. In the third, a lofty room, papered with white\r\nand lit up by a shaded lamp, stood two small cots, and a nurse with a\r\nwhite cape on her shoulders sat between the cots. She had a kindly, true\r\nSiberian face, with its high cheek-bones.\r\n\r\nThe nurse rose and bowed. The mother stooped over the first cot, in\r\nwhich a two-year-old little girl lay peacefully sleeping with her little\r\nmouth open and her long, curly hair tumbled over the pillow.\r\n\r\n"This is Katie," said the mother, straightening the white and blue\r\ncrochet coverlet, from under which a little white foot pushed itself\r\nlanguidly out.\r\n\r\n"Is she not pretty? She\'s only two years old, you know."\r\n\r\n"Lovely."\r\n\r\n"And this is Vasiuk, as \'grandpapa\' calls him. Quite a different type. A\r\nSiberian, is he not?"\r\n\r\n"A splendid boy," said Nekhludoff, as he looked at the little fatty\r\nlying asleep on his stomach.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the mother, with a smile full of meaning.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff recalled to his mind chains, shaved heads, fighting\r\ndebauchery, the dying Kryltzoff, Katusha and the whole of her past, and\r\nhe began to feel envious and to wish for what he saw here, which now\r\nseemed to him pure and refined happiness.\r\n\r\nAfter having repeatedly expressed his admiration of the children,\r\nthereby at least partially satisfying their mother, who eagerly drank\r\nin this praise, he followed her back to the drawing-room, where the\r\nEnglishman was waiting for him to go and visit the prison, as they had\r\narranged. Having taken leave of their hosts, the old and the young ones,\r\nthe Englishman and Nekhludoff went out into the porch of the General\'s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe weather had changed. It was snowing, and the snow fell densely in\r\nlarge flakes, and already covered the road, the roof and the trees in\r\nthe garden, the steps of the porch, the roof of the trap and the back of\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman had a trap of his own, and Nekhludoff, having told the\r\ncoachman to drive to the prison, called his isvostchik and got in with\r\nthe heavy sense of having to fulfil an unpleasant duty, and followed\r\nthe Englishman over the soft snow, through which the wheels turned with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nMASLOVA\'S DECISION.\r\n\r\nThe dismal prison house, with its sentinel and lamp burning under the\r\ngateway, produced an even more dismal impression, with its long row of\r\nlighted windows, than it had done in the morning, in spite of the white\r\ncovering that now lay over everything--the porch, the roof and the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThe imposing inspector came up to the gate and read the pass that had\r\nbeen given to Nekhludoff and the Englishman by the light of the lamp,\r\nshrugged his fine shoulders in surprise, but, in obedience to the order,\r\nasked the visitors to follow him in. He led them through the courtyard\r\nand then in at a door to the right and up a staircase into the office.\r\nHe offered them a seat and asked what he could do for them, and when\r\nhe heard that Nekhludoff would like to see Maslova at once, he sent a\r\njailer to fetch her. Then he prepared himself to answer the questions\r\nwhich the Englishman began to put to him, Nekhludoff acting as\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n"How many persons is the prison built to hold?" the Englishman asked.\r\n"How many are confined in it? How many men? How many women? Children?\r\nHow many sentenced to the mines? How many exiles? How many sick\r\npersons?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff translated the Englishman\'s and the inspector\'s words without\r\npaying any attention to their meaning, and felt an awkwardness he had\r\nnot in the least expected at the thought of the impending interview.\r\nWhen, in the midst of a sentence he was translating for the Englishman,\r\nhe heard the sound of approaching footsteps, and the office door opened,\r\nand, as had happened many times before, a jailer came in, followed by\r\nKatusha, and he saw her with a kerchief tied round her head, and in a\r\nprison jacket a heavy sensation came over him. "I wish to live, I want\r\na family, children, I want a human life." These thoughts flashed through\r\nhis mind as she entered the room with rapid steps and blinking her eyes.\r\n\r\nHe rose and made a few steps to meet her, and her face appeared hard\r\nand unpleasant to him. It was again as it had been at the time when\r\nshe reproached him. She flushed and turned pale, her fingers nervously\r\ntwisting a corner of her jacket. She looked up at him, then cast down\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"You know that a mitigation has come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the jailer told me."\r\n\r\n"So that as soon as the original document arrives you may come away and\r\nsettle where you like. We shall consider--"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him hurriedly. "What have I to consider? Where Valdemar\r\nSimonson goes, there I shall follow." In spite of the excitement she\r\nwas in she raised her eyes to Nekhludoff\'s and pronounced these words\r\nquickly and distinctly, as if she had prepared what she had to say.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Dmitri Ivanovitch, you see he wishes me to live with him--" and\r\nshe stopped, quite frightened, and corrected herself. "He wishes me to\r\nbe near him. What more can I desire? I must look upon it as happiness.\r\nWhat else is there for me--"\r\n\r\n"One of two things," thought he. "Either she loves Simonson and does not\r\nin the least require the sacrifice I imagined I was bringing her, or she\r\nstill loves me and refuses me for my own sake, and is burning her ships\r\nby uniting her fate with Simonson." And Nekhludoff felt ashamed and knew\r\nthat he was blushing.\r\n\r\n"And you yourself, do you love him?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Loving or not loving, what does it matter? I have given up all that.\r\nAnd then Valdemar Simonson is quite an exceptional man."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course," Nekhludoff began. "He is a splendid man, and I\r\nthink--"\r\n\r\nBut she again interrupted him, as if afraid that he might say too much\r\nor that she should not say all. "No, Dmitri Ivanovitch, you must forgive\r\nme if I am not doing what you wish," and she looked at him with those\r\nunfathomable, squinting eyes of hers. "Yes, it evidently must be so. You\r\nmust live, too."\r\n\r\nShe said just what he had been telling himself a few moments before, but\r\nhe no longer thought so now and felt very differently. He was not only\r\nashamed, but felt sorry to lose all he was losing with her. "I did not\r\nexpect this," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why should you live here and suffer? You have suffered enough."\r\n\r\n"I have not suffered. It was good for me, and I should like to go on\r\nserving you if I could."\r\n\r\n"We do not want anything," she said, and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"You have done so much for me as it is. If it had not been for you--"\r\nShe wished to say more, but her voice trembled.\r\n\r\n"You certainly have no reason to thank me," Nekhludoff said.\r\n\r\n"Where is the use of our reckoning? God will make up our accounts," she\r\nsaid, and her black eyes began to glisten with the tears that filled\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"What a good woman you are," he said.\r\n\r\n"I good?" she said through her tears, and a pathetic smile lit up her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready?" the Englishman asked.\r\n\r\n"Directly," replied Nekhludoff and asked her about Kryltzoff.\r\n\r\nShe got over her emotion and quietly told him all she knew. Kryltzoff\r\nwas very weak and had been sent into the infirmary. Mary Pavlovna was\r\nvery anxious, and had asked to be allowed to go to the infirmary as a\r\nnurse, but could not get the permission.\r\n\r\n"Am I to go?" she asked, noticing that the Englishman was waiting.\r\n\r\n"I will not say good-bye; I shall see you again," said Nekhludoff,\r\nholding out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me," she said so low that he could hardly hear her. Their eyes\r\nmet, and Nekhludoff knew by the strange look of her squinting eyes and\r\nthe pathetic smile with which she said not "Good-bye" but "Forgive\r\nme," that of the two reasons that might have led to her resolution,\r\nthe second was the real one. She loved him, and thought that by uniting\r\nherself to him she would be spoiling his life. By going with Simonson\r\nshe thought she would be setting Nekhludoff free, and felt glad that she\r\nhad done what she meant to do, and yet she suffered at parting from him.\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand, turned quickly and left the room.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff was ready to go, but saw that the Englishman was noting\r\nsomething down, and did not disturb him, but sat down on a wooden seat\r\nby the wall, and suddenly a feeling of terrible weariness came over him.\r\nIt was not a sleepless night that had tired him, not the journey, not\r\nthe excitement, but he felt terribly tired of living. He leaned against\r\nthe back of the bench, shut his eyes and in a moment fell into a deep,\r\nheavy sleep.\r\n\r\n"Well, would you like to look round the cells now?" the inspector asked.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff looked up and was surprised to find himself where he was. The\r\nEnglishman had finished his notes and expressed a wish to see the cells.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff, tired and indifferent, followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH VISITOR.\r\n\r\nWhen they had passed the anteroom and the sickening, stinking corridor,\r\nthe Englishman and Nekhludoff, accompanied by the inspector, entered the\r\nfirst cell, where those sentenced to hard labour were confined. The beds\r\ntook up the middle of the cell and the prisoners were all in bed. There\r\nwere about 70 of them. When the visitors entered all the prisoners\r\njumped up and stood beside the beds, excepting two, a young man who was\r\nin a state of high fever, and an old man who did nothing but groan.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman asked if the young man had long been ill. The inspector\r\nsaid that he was taken ill in the morning, but that the old man had long\r\nbeen suffering with pains in the stomach, but could not be removed, as\r\nthe infirmary had been overfilled for a long time. The Englishman shook\r\nhis head disapprovingly, said he would like to say a few words to these\r\npeople, asking Nekhludoff to interpret. It turned out that besides\r\nstudying the places of exile and the prisons of Siberia, the Englishman\r\nhad another object in view, that of preaching salvation through faith\r\nand by the redemption.\r\n\r\n"Tell them," he said, "that Christ died for them. If they believe in\r\nthis they shall be saved." While he spoke, all the prisoners stood\r\nsilent with their arms at their sides. "This book, tell them," he\r\ncontinued, "says all about it. Can any of them read?"\r\n\r\nThere were more than 20 who could.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman took several bound Testaments out of a hang-bag, and many\r\nstrong hands with their hard, black nails stretched out from beneath the\r\ncoarse shirt-sleeves towards him. He gave away two Testaments in this\r\ncell.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened in the second cell. There was the same foul air,\r\nthe same icon hanging between the windows, the same tub to the left of\r\nthe door, and they were all lying side by side close to one another, and\r\njumped up in the same manner and stood stretched full length with their\r\narms by their sides, all but three, two of whom sat up and one remained\r\nlying, and did not even look at the newcomers; these three were also\r\nill. The Englishman made the same speech and again gave away two books.\r\n\r\nIn the third room four were ill. When the Englishman asked why the sick\r\nwere not put all together into one cell, the inspector said that they\r\ndid not wish it themselves, that their diseases were not infectious, and\r\nthat the medical assistant watched them and attended to them.\r\n\r\n"He has not set foot here for a fortnight," muttered a voice.\r\n\r\nThe inspector did not say anything and led the way to the next cell.\r\nAgain the door was unlocked, and all got up and stood silent. Again the\r\nEnglishman gave away Testaments. It was the same in the fifth and sixth\r\ncells, in those to the right and those to the left.\r\n\r\nFrom those sentenced to hard labour they went on to the exiles.\r\n\r\nFrom the exiles to those evicted by the Commune and those who followed\r\nof their own free will.\r\n\r\nEverywhere men, cold, hungry, idle, infected, degraded, imprisoned, were\r\nshown off like wild beasts.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, having given away the appointed number of Testaments,\r\nstopped giving any more, and made no speeches. The oppressing sight, and\r\nespecially the stifling atmosphere, quelled even his energy, and he went\r\nfrom cell to cell, saying nothing but "All right" to the inspector\'s\r\nremarks about what prisoners there were in each cell.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff followed as in a dream, unable either to refuse to go on or\r\nto go away, and with the same feelings of weariness and hopelessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nKRYLTZOFF AT REST.\r\n\r\nIn one of the exiles\' cells Nekhludoff, to his surprise, recognised the\r\nstrange old man he had seen crossing the ferry that morning. This old\r\nman was sitting on the floor by the beds, barefooted, with only a dirty\r\ncinder-coloured shirt on, torn on one shoulder, and similar trousers.\r\nHe looked severely and enquiringly at the newcomers. His emaciated body,\r\nvisible through the holes of his shirt, looked miserably weak, but in\r\nhis face was even more concentrated seriousness and animation than when\r\nNekhludoff saw him crossing the ferry. As in all the other cells, so\r\nhere also the prisoners jumped up and stood erect when the official\r\nentered, but the old man remained sitting. His eyes glittered and his\r\nbrows frowned with wrath.\r\n\r\n"Get up," the inspector called out to him.\r\n\r\nThe old man did not rise and only smiled contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Thy servants are standing before thee. I am not thy servant. Thou\r\nbearest the seal--" The old man pointed to the inspector\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n"Wha-a-t?" said the inspector threateningly, and made a step towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I know this man," Nekhludoff hastened to say; "what is he imprisoned\r\nfor?"\r\n\r\n"The police have sent him here because he has no passport. We ask them\r\nnot to send such, but they will do it," said the inspector, casting an\r\nangry side look at the old man.\r\n\r\n"And so it seems thou, too, art one of Antichrist\'s army?" the old man\r\nsaid to Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"No, I am a visitor," said Nekhludoff.\r\n\r\n"What, hast thou come to see how Antichrist tortures men? There, look,\r\nhe has locked them up in a cage, a whole army of them. Men should eat\r\nbread in the sweat of their brow. And he has locked them up with no work\r\nto do, and feeds them like swine, so that they should turn into beasts."\r\n\r\n"What is he saying?" asked the Englishman.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff told him the old man was blaming the inspector for keeping\r\nmen imprisoned.\r\n\r\n"Ask him how he thinks one should treat those who do not keep to the\r\nlaws," said the Englishman.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff translated the question. The old man laughed in a strange\r\nmanner, showing his teeth.\r\n\r\n"The laws?" he repeated with contempt. "He first robbed everybody, took\r\nall the earth, all the rights away from men, killed all those who were\r\nagainst him, and then wrote laws, forbidding robbery and murder. He\r\nshould have written these laws before."\r\n\r\nNekhludoff translated. The Englishman smiled. "Well, anyhow, ask him how\r\none should treat thieves and murderers at present?"\r\n\r\nNekhludoff again translated his question.\r\n\r\n"Tell him he should take the seal of Antichrist off himself," the\r\nold man said, frowning severely; "then there will be no thieves and\r\nmurderers. Tell him so."\r\n\r\n"He is crazy," said the Englishman, when Nekhludoff had translated the\r\nold man\'s words, and, shrugging his shoulders, he left the cell.\r\n\r\n"Do thy business and leave them alone. Every one for himself. God knows\r\nwhom to execute, whom to forgive, and we do not know," said the old man.\r\n"Every man be his own chief, then the chiefs will not be wanted. Go,\r\ngo!" he added, angrily frowning and looking with glittering eyes at\r\nNekhludoff, who lingered in the cell. "Hast thou not looked on long\r\nenough how the servants of Antichrist feed lice on men? Go, go!"\r\n\r\nWhen Nekhludoff went out he saw the Englishman standing by the open door\r\nof an empty cell with the inspector, asking what the cell was for. The\r\ninspector explained that it was the mortuary.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the Englishman when Nekhludoff had translated, and expressed\r\nthe wish to go in.\r\n\r\nThe mortuary was an ordinary cell, not very large. A small lamp hung on\r\nthe wall and dimly lit up sacks and logs of wood that were piled up in\r\none corner, and four dead bodies lay on the bedshelves to the right. The\r\nfirst body had a coarse linen shirt and trousers on; it was that of a\r\ntall man with a small beard and half his head shaved. The body was quite\r\nrigid; the bluish hands, that had evidently been folded on the breast,\r\nhad separated; the legs were also apart and the bare feet were sticking\r\nout. Next to him lay a bare-footed old woman in a white petticoat, her\r\nhead, with its thin plait of hair, uncovered, with a little, pinched\r\nyellow face and a sharp nose. Beyond her was another man with something\r\nlilac on. This colour reminded Nekhludoff of something. He came nearer\r\nand looked at the body. The small, pointed beard sticking upwards, the\r\nfirm, well-shaped nose, the high, white forehead, the thin, curly hair;\r\nhe recognised the familiar features and could hardly believe his eyes.\r\nYesterday he had seen this face, angry, excited, and full of suffering;\r\nnow it was quiet, motionless, and terribly beautiful. Yes, it was\r\nKryltzoff, or at any rate the trace that his material existence had left\r\nbehind. "Why had he suffered? Why had he lived? Does he now understand?"\r\nNekhludoff thought, and there seemed to be no answer, seemed to be\r\nnothing but death, and he felt faint. Without taking leave of the\r\nEnglishman, Nekhludoff asked the inspector to lead him out into the\r\nyard, and feeling the absolute necessity of being alone to think over\r\nall that had happened that evening, he drove back to his hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA NEW LIFE DAWNS FOR NEKHLUDOFF.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff did not go to bed, but went up and down his room for a long\r\ntime. His business with Katusha was at an end. He was not wanted,\r\nand this made him sad and ashamed. His other business was not only\r\nunfinished, but troubled him more than ever and demanded his activity.\r\nAll this horrible evil that he had seen and learned to know lately, and\r\nespecially to-day in that awful prison, this evil, which had killed\r\nthat dear Kryltzoff, ruled and was triumphant, and he could foreseen\r\npossibility of conquering or even knowing how to conquer it. Those\r\nhundreds and thousands of degraded human beings locked up in the noisome\r\nprisons by indifferent generals, procureurs, inspectors, rose up in\r\nhis imagination; he remembered the strange, free old man accusing the\r\nofficials, and therefore considered mad, and among the corpses the\r\nbeautiful, waxen face of Kryltzoff, who had died in anger. And again the\r\nquestion as to whether he was mad or those who considered they were in\r\ntheir right minds while they committed all these deeds stood before him\r\nwith renewed force and demanded an answer.\r\n\r\nTired of pacing up and down, tired of thinking, he sat down on the sofa\r\nnear the lamp and mechanically opened the Testament which the Englishman\r\nhad given him as a remembrance, and which he had thrown on the table\r\nwhen he emptied his pockets on coming in.\r\n\r\n"It is said one can find an answer to everything here," he thought, and\r\nopened the Testament at random and began reading Matt. xviii. 1-4: "In\r\nthat hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in\r\nthe Kingdom of Heaven? And He called to Him a little child, and set him\r\nin the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn\r\nand become as little children, ye shall in nowise enter into the Kingdom\r\nof Heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child\r\nthe same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, that is true," he said, remembering that he had known the\r\npeace and joy of life only when he had humbled himself.\r\n\r\n"And whosoever shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth\r\nMe, but whoso shall cause one of these little ones to stumble, it is\r\nmore profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about\r\nhis neck and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea." (Matt.\r\nxviii. 5, 6.)\r\n\r\n"What is this for, \'Whosoever shall receive?\' Receive where? And what\r\ndoes \'in my name\' mean?" he asked, feeling that these words did not tell\r\nhim anything. "And why \'the millstone round his neck and the depths of\r\nthe sea?\' No, that is not it: it is not clear," and he remembered how\r\nmore than once in his life he had taken to reading the Gospels, and how\r\nwant of clearness in these passages had repulsed him. He went on to\r\nread the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth verses about the occasions of\r\nstumbling, and that they must come, and about punishment by casting men\r\ninto hell fire, and some kind of angels who see the face of the Father\r\nin Heaven. "What a pity that this is so incoherent," he thought, "yet\r\none feels that there is something good in it."\r\n\r\n"For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost," he continued to\r\nread.\r\n\r\n"How think ye? If any man have a hundred sheep and one of them go\r\nastray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine and go into the mountains\r\nand seek that which goeth astray? And if so be that he find it, verily\r\nI say unto you, he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine\r\nwhich have not gone astray.\r\n\r\n"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in Heaven that one\r\nof these little ones should perish."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is not the will of the Father that they should perish, and\r\nhere they are perishing by hundreds and thousands. And there is no\r\npossibility of saving them," he thought.\r\n\r\n"Then came Peter and said to him, How oft shall my brother offend me and\r\nI forgive him? Until seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto\r\nthee until seven times, but until seventy times seven.\r\n\r\n"Therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven likened unto a certain king which\r\nmade a reckoning with his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one\r\nwas brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch\r\nas he had not wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and\r\nhis wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.\r\nThe servant therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have\r\npatience with me; I will pay thee all. And the lord of that servant,\r\nbeing moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt. But\r\nthat servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants which owed\r\nhim a hundred pence; and he laid hold on him and took him by the\r\nthroat, saying, Pay what thou owest. So his fellow-servant fell down and\r\nbesought him, saying, Have patience with me and I will pay thee. And\r\nhe would not, but went and cast him into prison till he should pay that\r\nwhich was due. So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were\r\nexceeding sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.\r\nThen his lord called him unto him and saith to him, Thou wicked servant,\r\nI forgave thee all that debt because thou besought me; shouldst not thou\r\nalso have mercy on thy fellow-servant as I had mercy on thee?"\r\n\r\n"And is this all?" Nekhludoff suddenly exclaimed aloud, and the inner\r\nvoice of the whole of his being said, "Yes, it is all." And it happened\r\nto Nekhludoff, as it often happens to men who are living a spiritual\r\nlife. The thought that seemed strange at first and paradoxical or\r\neven to be only a joke, being confirmed more and more often by life\'s\r\nexperience, suddenly appeared as the simplest, truest certainty. In this\r\nway the idea that the only certain means of salvation from the\r\nterrible evil from which men were suffering was that they should always\r\nacknowledge themselves to be sinning against God, and therefore unable\r\nto punish or correct others, because they were dear to Him. It became\r\nclear to him that all the dreadful evil he had been witnessing in\r\nprisons and jails and the quiet self-satisfaction of the perpetrators of\r\nthis evil were the consequences of men trying to do what was impossible;\r\ntrying to correct evil while being evil themselves; vicious men were\r\ntrying to correct other vicious men, and thought they could do it by\r\nusing mechanical means, and the only consequence of all this was that\r\nthe needs and the cupidity of some men induced them to take up this\r\nso-called punishment and correction as a profession, and have themselves\r\nbecome utterly corrupt, and go on unceasingly depraving those whom they\r\ntorment. Now he saw clearly what all the terrors he had seen came from,\r\nand what ought to be done to put a stop to them. The answer he could\r\nnot find was the same that Christ gave to Peter. It was that we should\r\nforgive always an infinite number of times because there are no men who\r\nhave not sinned themselves, and therefore none can punish or correct\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"But surely it cannot be so simple," thought Nekhludoff, and yet he saw\r\nwith certainty, strange as it had seemed at first, that it was not only\r\na theoretical but also a practical solution of the question. The usual\r\nobjection, "What is one to do with the evil doers? Surely not let them\r\ngo unpunished?" no longer confused him. This objection might have a\r\nmeaning if it were proved that punishment lessened crime, or improved\r\nthe criminal, but when the contrary was proved, and it was evident that\r\nit was not in people\'s power to correct each other, the only reasonable\r\nthing to do is to leave off doing the things which are not only useless,\r\nbut harmful, immoral and cruel.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries people who were considered criminals have been\r\ntortured. Well, and have they ceased to exist? No; their numbers have\r\nbeen increased not alone by the criminals corrupted by punishment but\r\nalso by those lawful criminals, the judges, procureurs, magistrates\r\nand jailers, who judge and punish men. Nekhludoff now understood\r\nthat society and order in general exists not because of these lawful\r\ncriminals who judge and punish others, but because in spite of men being\r\nthus depraved, they still pity and love one another.\r\n\r\nIn hopes of finding a confirmation of this thought in the Gospel,\r\nNekhludoff began reading it from the beginning. When he had read the\r\nSermon on the Mount, which had always touched him, he saw in it for the\r\nfirst time to-day not beautiful abstract thoughts, setting forth for\r\nthe most part exaggerated and impossible demands, but simple, clear,\r\npractical laws. If these laws were carried out in practice (and this\r\nwas quite possible) they would establish perfectly new and surprising\r\nconditions of social life, in which the violence that filled Nekhludoff\r\nwith such indignation would cease of itself. Not only this, but the\r\ngreatest blessing that is obtainable to men, the Kingdom of Heaven on\r\nEarth would be established. There were five of these laws.\r\n\r\nThe first (Matt. v. 21-26), that man should not only do no murder,\r\nbut not even be angry with his brother, should not consider any one\r\nworthless: "Raca," and if he has quarrelled with any one he should make\r\nit up with him before bringing his gift to God--i.e., before praying.\r\n\r\nThe second (Matt. v. 27-32), that man should not only not commit\r\nadultery but should not even seek for enjoyment in a woman\'s beauty, and\r\nif he has once come together with a woman he should never be faithless\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nThe third (Matt. 33-37), that man should never bind himself by oath.\r\n\r\nThe fourth (Matt. 38-42), that man should not only not demand an eye for\r\nan eye, but when struck on one cheek should hold out the other, should\r\nforgive an offence and bear it humbly, and never refuse the service\r\nothers demand of him.\r\n\r\nThe fifth (Matt. 43-48), that man should not only not hate his enemy and\r\nnot fight him, but love him, help him, serve him.\r\n\r\nNekhludoff sat staring at the lamp and his heart stood still. Recalling\r\nthe monstrous confusion of the life we lead, he distinctly saw what that\r\nlife could be if men were brought up to obey these rules, and rapture\r\nsuch as he had long not felt filled his soul, just as if after long days\r\nof weariness and suffering he had suddenly found ease and freedom.\r\n\r\nHe did not sleep all night, and as it happens to many and many a man who\r\nreads the Gospels he understood for the first time the full meaning of\r\nthe words read so often before but passed by unnoticed. He imbibed all\r\nthese necessary, important and joyful revelations as a sponge imbibes\r\nwater. And all he read seemed so familiar and seemed to confirm, to form\r\ninto a conception, what he had known long ago, but had never realised\r\nand never quite believed. Now he realised and believed it, and not\r\nonly realised and believed that if men would obey these laws they would\r\nobtain the highest blessing they can attain to, he also realised and\r\nbelieved that the only duty of every man is to fulfil these laws; that\r\nin this lies the only reasonable meaning of life, that every stepping\r\naside from these laws is a mistake which is immediately followed by\r\nretribution. This flowed from the whole of the teaching, and was most\r\nstrongly and clearly illustrated in the parable of the vineyard.\r\n\r\nThe husbandman imagined that the vineyard in which they were sent to\r\nwork for their master was their own, that all that was in was made\r\nfor them, and that their business was to enjoy life in this vineyard,\r\nforgetting the Master and killing all those who reminded them of his\r\nexistence. "Are we not doing the same," Nekhludoff thought, "when we\r\nimagine ourselves to be masters of our lives, and that life is given us\r\nfor enjoyment? This evidently is an incongruity. We were sent here by\r\nsome one\'s will and for some reason. And we have concluded that we live\r\nonly for our own joy, and of course we feel unhappy as labourers do when\r\nnot fulfilling their Master\'s orders. The Master\'s will is expressed in\r\nthese commandments. If men will only fulfil these laws, the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven will be established on earth, and men will receive the greatest\r\ngood that they can attain to.\r\n\r\n"\'Seek ye first the Kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things\r\nshall be added unto you.\'\r\n\r\n"And so here it is, the business of my life. Scarcely have I finished\r\none and another has commenced." And a perfectly new life dawned that\r\nnight for Nekhludoff, not because he had entered into new conditions of\r\nlife, but because everything he did after that night had a new and quite\r\ndifferent significance than before. How this new period of his life will\r\nend time alone will prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: Corrected "Are we do not doing the same," to "Are\r\nwe not doing the same," in third last paragraph.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Resurrection, by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RESURRECTION ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1938.txt or 1938.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/3/1938/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jim Tinsley\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
