They were plainly but not ill clad, though the thick\r\nhoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from an\r\nobviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their\r\nappearance just now.\r\n\r\nThe man was of fine figure, swarthy, and stern in aspect; and he showed\r\nin profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost\r\nperpendicular. He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than the\r\nremainder of his suit, which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn\r\nbuttons, breeches of the same, tanned leggings, and a straw hat\r\noverlaid with black glazed canvas. At his back he carried by a looped\r\nstrap a rush basket, from which protruded at one end the crutch of a\r\nhay-knife, a wimble for hay-bonds being also visible in the aperture.\r\nHis measured, springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as\r\ndistinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer; while in\r\nthe turn and plant of each foot there was, further, a dogged and\r\ncynical indifference personal to himself, showing its presence even in\r\nthe regularly interchanging fustian folds, now in the left leg, now in\r\nthe right, as he paced along.\r\n\r\nWhat was really peculiar, however, in this couple\xe2\x80\x99s progress, and would\r\nhave attracted the attention of any casual observer otherwise disposed\r\nto overlook them, was the perfect silence they preserved. They walked\r\nside by side in such a way as to suggest afar off the low, easy,\r\nconfidential chat of people full of reciprocity; but on closer view it\r\ncould be discerned that the man was reading, or pretending to read, a\r\nballad sheet which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the\r\nhand that was passed through the basket strap. Whether this apparent\r\ncause were the real cause, or whether it were an assumed one to escape\r\nan intercourse that would have been irksome to him, nobody but himself\r\ncould have said precisely; but his taciturnity was unbroken, and the\r\nwoman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence. Virtually she\r\nwalked the highway alone, save for the child she bore. Sometimes the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s bent elbow almost touched her shoulder, for she kept as close to\r\nhis side as was possible without actual contact, but she seemed to have\r\nno idea of taking his arm, nor he of offering it; and far from\r\nexhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared to receive it\r\nas a natural thing. If any word at all were uttered by the little\r\ngroup, it was an occasional whisper of the woman to the child\xe2\x80\x94a tiny\r\ngirl in short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarn\xe2\x80\x94and the murmured\r\nbabble of the child in reply.\r\n\r\nThe chief\xe2\x80\x94almost the only\xe2\x80\x94attraction of the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s face was its\r\nmobility. When she looked down sideways to the girl she became pretty,\r\nand even handsome, particularly that in the action her features caught\r\nslantwise the rays of the strongly coloured sun, which made\r\ntransparencies of her eyelids and nostrils and set fire on her lips.\r\nWhen she plodded on in the shade of the hedge, silently thinking, she\r\nhad the hard, half-apathetic expression of one who deems anything\r\npossible at the hands of Time and Chance except, perhaps, fair play.\r\nThe first phase was the work of Nature, the second probably of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThat the man and woman were husband and wife, and the parents of the\r\ngirl in arms there could be little doubt. No other than such\r\nrelationship would have accounted for the atmosphere of stale\r\nfamiliarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus as\r\nthey moved down the road.\r\n\r\nThe wife mostly kept her eyes fixed ahead, though with little\r\ninterest\xe2\x80\x94the scene for that matter being one that might have been\r\nmatched at almost any spot in any county in England at this time of the\r\nyear; a road neither straight nor crooked, neither level nor hilly,\r\nbordered by hedges, trees, and other vegetation, which had entered the\r\nblackened-green stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on\r\ntheir way to dingy, and yellow, and red. The grassy margin of the bank,\r\nand the nearest hedgerow boughs, were powdered by the dust that had\r\nbeen stirred over them by hasty vehicles, the same dust as it lay on\r\nthe road deadening their footfalls like a carpet; and this, with the\r\naforesaid total absence of conversation, allowed every extraneous sound\r\nto be heard.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was none, beyond the voice of a weak bird singing\r\na trite old evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the\r\nhill at the same hour, and with the self-same trills, quavers, and\r\nbreves, at any sunset of that season for centuries untold. But as they\r\napproached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles reached their\r\nears from some elevated spot in that direction, as yet screened from\r\nview by foliage. When the outlying houses of Weydon-Priors could just\r\nbe described, the family group was met by a turnip-hoer with his hoe on\r\nhis shoulder, and his dinner-bag suspended from it. The reader promptly\r\nglanced up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny trade doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked phlegmatically, designating the\r\nvillage in his van by a wave of the broadsheet. And thinking the\r\nlabourer did not understand him, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnything in the\r\nhay-trussing line?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe turnip-hoer had already begun shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, save the man,\r\nwhat wisdom\xe2\x80\x99s in him that \xe2\x80\x99a should come to Weydon for a job of that\r\nsort this time o\xe2\x80\x99 year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen is there any house to let\xe2\x80\x94a little small new cottage just a\r\nbuilded, or such like?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other.\r\n\r\nThe pessimist still maintained a negative. \xe2\x80\x9cPulling down is more the\r\nnater of Weydon. There were five houses cleared away last year, and\r\nthree this; and the volk nowhere to go\xe2\x80\x94no, not so much as a thatched\r\nhurdle; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way o\xe2\x80\x99 Weydon-Priors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hay-trusser, which he obviously was, nodded with some\r\nsuperciliousness. Looking towards the village, he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nsomething going on here, however, is there not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy. \xe2\x80\x99Tis Fair Day. Though what you hear now is little more than the\r\nclatter and scurry of getting away the money o\xe2\x80\x99 children and fools, for\r\nthe real business is done earlier than this. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working within\r\nsound o\xe2\x80\x99t all day, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go up\xe2\x80\x94not I. \xe2\x80\x99Twas no business of\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trusser and his family proceeded on their way, and soon entered the\r\nFair-field, which showed standing-places and pens where many hundreds\r\nof horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon, but\r\nwere now in great part taken away. At present, as their informant had\r\nobserved, but little real business remained on hand, the chief being\r\nthe sale by auction of a few inferior animals, that could not otherwise\r\nbe disposed of, and had been absolutely refused by the better class of\r\ntraders, who came and went early. Yet the crowd was denser now than\r\nduring the morning hours, the frivolous contingent of visitors,\r\nincluding journeymen out for a holiday, a stray soldier or two come on\r\nfurlough, village shopkeepers, and the like, having latterly flocked\r\nin; persons whose activities found a congenial field among the\r\npeep-shows, toy-stands, waxworks, inspired monsters, disinterested\r\nmedical men who travelled for the public good, thimble-riggers,\r\nnick-nack vendors, and readers of Fate.\r\n\r\nNeither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things, and they\r\nlooked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the\r\ndown. Two, which stood nearest to them in the ochreous haze of expiring\r\nsunlight, seemed almost equally inviting. One was formed of new,\r\nmilk-hued canvas, and bore red flags on its summit; it announced \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nHome-brewed Beer, Ale, and Cyder.\xe2\x80\x9d The other was less new; a little\r\niron stove-pipe came out of it at the back and in front appeared the\r\nplacard, \xe2\x80\x9cGood Furmity Sold Hear.\xe2\x80\x9d The man mentally weighed the two\r\ninscriptions and inclined to the former tent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94the other one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI always like furmity; and so\r\ndoes Elizabeth-Jane; and so will you. It is nourishing after a long\r\nhard day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never tasted it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. However, he gave way to her\r\nrepresentations, and they entered the furmity booth forthwith.\r\n\r\nA rather numerous company appeared within, seated at the long narrow\r\ntables that ran down the tent on each side. At the upper end stood a\r\nstove, containing a charcoal fire, over which hung a large three-legged\r\ncrock, sufficiently polished round the rim to show that it was made of\r\nbell-metal. A haggish creature of about fifty presided, in a white\r\napron, which as it threw an air of respectability over her as far as it\r\nextended, was made so wide as to reach nearly round her waist. She\r\nslowly stirred the contents of the pot. The dull scrape of her large\r\nspoon was audible throughout the tent as she thus kept from burning the\r\nmixture of corn in the grain, flour, milk, raisins, currants, and what\r\nnot, that composed the antiquated slop in which she dealt. Vessels\r\nholding the separate ingredients stood on a white-clothed table of\r\nboards and trestles close by.\r\n\r\nThe young man and woman ordered a basin each of the mixture, steaming\r\nhot, and sat down to consume it at leisure. This was very well so far,\r\nfor furmity, as the woman had said, was nourishing, and as proper a\r\nfood as could be obtained within the four seas; though, to those not\r\naccustomed to it, the grains of wheat swollen as large as lemon-pips,\r\nwhich floated on its surface, might have a deterrent effect at first.\r\n\r\nBut there was more in that tent than met the cursory glance; and the\r\nman, with the instinct of a perverse character, scented it quickly.\r\nAfter a mincing attack on his bowl, he watched the hag\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings\r\nfrom the corner of his eye, and saw the game she played. He winked to\r\nher, and passed up his basin in reply to her nod; when she took a\r\nbottle from under the table, slily measured out a quantity of its\r\ncontents, and tipped the same into the man\xe2\x80\x99s furmity. The liquor poured\r\nin was rum. The man as slily sent back money in payment.\r\n\r\nHe found the concoction, thus strongly laced, much more to his\r\nsatisfaction than it had been in its natural state. His wife had\r\nobserved the proceeding with much uneasiness; but he persuaded her to\r\nhave hers laced also, and she agreed to a milder allowance after some\r\nmisgiving.\r\n\r\nThe man finished his basin, and called for another, the rum being\r\nsignalled for in yet stronger proportion. The effect of it was soon\r\napparent in his manner, and his wife but too sadly perceived that in\r\nstrenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquor-tent she had\r\nonly got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers.\r\n\r\nThe child began to prattle impatiently, and the wife more than once\r\nsaid to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cMichael, how about our lodging? You know we may\r\nhave trouble in getting it if we don\xe2\x80\x99t go soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he turned a deaf ear to those bird-like chirpings. He talked loud\r\nto the company. The child\xe2\x80\x99s black eyes, after slow, round, ruminating\r\ngazes at the candles when they were lighted, fell together; then they\r\nopened, then shut again, and she slept.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity; at the\r\nsecond he was jovial; at the third, argumentative, at the fourth, the\r\nqualities signified by the shape of his face, the occasional clench of\r\nhis mouth, and the fiery spark of his dark eye, began to tell in his\r\nconduct; he was overbearing\xe2\x80\x94even brilliantly quarrelsome.\r\n\r\nThe conversation took a high turn, as it often does on such occasions.\r\nThe ruin of good men by bad wives, and, more particularly, the\r\nfrustration of many a promising youth\xe2\x80\x99s high aims and hopes and the\r\nextinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage, was the\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did for myself that way thoroughly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trusser with a\r\ncontemplative bitterness that was well-nigh resentful. \xe2\x80\x9cI married at\r\neighteen, like the fool that I was; and this is the consequence o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to\r\nbring out the penuriousness of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe young woman his wife, who seemed accustomed to such remarks, acted\r\nas if she did not hear them, and continued her intermittent private\r\nwords of tender trifles to the sleeping and waking child, who was just\r\nbig enough to be placed for a moment on the bench beside her when she\r\nwished to ease her arms. The man continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t more than fifteen shillings in the world, and yet I am a\r\ngood experienced hand in my line. I\xe2\x80\x99d challenge England to beat me in\r\nthe fodder business; and if I were a free man again I\xe2\x80\x99d be worth a\r\nthousand pound before I\xe2\x80\x99d done o\xe2\x80\x99t. But a fellow never knows these\r\nlittle things till all chance of acting upon \xe2\x80\x99em is past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be\r\nheard saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow this is the last lot\xe2\x80\x94now who\xe2\x80\x99ll take the last lot\r\nfor a song? Shall I say forty shillings? \xe2\x80\x99Tis a very promising\r\nbroodmare, a trifle over five years old, and nothing the matter with\r\nthe hoss at all, except that she\xe2\x80\x99s a little holler in the back and had\r\nher left eye knocked out by the kick of another, her own sister, coming\r\nalong the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why men who have got wives and don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x99em,\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of \xe2\x80\x99em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the man in the tent. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they put \xe2\x80\x99em up and sell \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nby auction to men who are in need of such articles? Hey? Why, begad,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s them that would do that,\xe2\x80\x9d some of the guests replied, looking\r\nat the woman, who was by no means ill-favoured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said a smoking gentleman, whose coat had the fine polish about\r\nthe collar, elbows, seams, and shoulder-blades that long-continued\r\nfriction with grimy surfaces will produce, and which is usually more\r\ndesired on furniture than on clothes. From his appearance he had\r\npossibly been in former time groom or coachman to some neighbouring\r\ncounty family. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had my breedings in as good circles, I may say, as\r\nany man,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know true cultivation, or nobody do; and I\r\ncan declare she\xe2\x80\x99s got it\xe2\x80\x94in the bone, mind ye, I say\xe2\x80\x94as much as any\r\nfemale in the fair\xe2\x80\x94though it may want a little bringing out.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\ncrossing his legs, he resumed his pipe with a nicely-adjusted gaze at a\r\npoint in the air.\r\n\r\nThe fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected\r\npraise of his wife, half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude\r\ntowards the possessor of such qualities. But he speedily lapsed into\r\nhis former conviction, and said harshly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, now is your chance; I am open to an offer for this gem o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncreation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to her husband and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cMichael, you have talked this\r\nnonsense in public places before. A joke is a joke, but you may make it\r\nonce too often, mind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it before; I meant it. All I want is a buyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the moment a swallow, one among the last of the season, which had by\r\nchance found its way through an opening into the upper part of the\r\ntent, flew to and fro quick curves above their heads, causing all eyes\r\nto follow it absently. In watching the bird till it made its escape the\r\nassembled company neglected to respond to the workman\xe2\x80\x99s offer, and the\r\nsubject dropped.\r\n\r\nBut a quarter of an hour later the man, who had gone on lacing his\r\nfurmity more and more heavily, though he was either so strong-minded or\r\nsuch an intrepid toper that he still appeared fairly sober, recurred to\r\nthe old strain, as in a musical fantasy the instrument fetches up the\r\noriginal theme. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94I am waiting to know about this offer of mine.\r\nThe woman is no good to me. Who\xe2\x80\x99ll have her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe company had by this time decidedly degenerated, and the renewed\r\ninquiry was received with a laugh of appreciation. The woman whispered;\r\nshe was imploring and anxious: \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, it is getting dark, and\r\nthis nonsense won\xe2\x80\x99t do. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t come along, I shall go without\r\nyou. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited and waited; yet he did not move. In ten minutes the man\r\nbroke in upon the desultory conversation of the furmity drinkers with,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked this question, and nobody answered to \xe2\x80\x99t. Will any Jack Rag or\r\nTom Straw among ye buy my goods?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s manner changed, and her face assumed the grim shape and\r\ncolour of which mention has been made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMike, Mike,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is getting serious. O!\xe2\x80\x94too serious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill anybody buy her?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish somebody would,\xe2\x80\x9d said she firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cHer present owner is not at\r\nall to her liking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor you to mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we are agreed about that. Gentlemen,\r\nyou hear? It\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement to part. She shall take the girl if she\r\nwants to, and go her ways. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my tools, and go my ways. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nsimple as Scripture history. Now then, stand up, Susan, and show\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, my chiel,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a buxom staylace dealer in voluminous\r\npetticoats, who sat near the woman; \xe2\x80\x9cyer good man don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman, however, did stand up. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, who\xe2\x80\x99s auctioneer?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nhay-trusser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI be,\xe2\x80\x9d promptly answered a short man, with a nose resembling a copper\r\nknob, a damp voice, and eyes like button-holes. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99ll make an offer\r\nfor this lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman looked on the ground, as if she maintained her position by a\r\nsupreme effort of will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive shillings,\xe2\x80\x9d said someone, at which there was a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo insults,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99ll say a guinea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody answered; and the female dealer in staylaces interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehave yerself moral, good man, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s love! Ah, what a cruelty\r\nis the poor soul married to! Bed and board is dear at some figures \xe2\x80\x99pon\r\nmy \xe2\x80\x99vation \xe2\x80\x99tis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet it higher, auctioneer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trusser.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo guineas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the auctioneer; and no one replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they don\xe2\x80\x99t take her for that, in ten seconds they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to give\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Now auctioneer, add another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree guineas\xe2\x80\x94going for three guineas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the rheumy man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo bid?\xe2\x80\x9d said the husband. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord, why she\xe2\x80\x99s cost me fifty times\r\nthe money, if a penny. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour guineas!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the auctioneer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye what\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t sell her for less than five,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nhusband, bringing down his fist so that the basins danced. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sell\r\nher for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money, and treat\r\nher well; and he shall have her for ever, and never hear aught o\xe2\x80\x99 me.\r\nBut she shan\xe2\x80\x99t go for less. Now then\xe2\x80\x94five guineas\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s yours.\r\nSusan, you agree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head with absolute indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive guineas,\xe2\x80\x9d said the auctioneer, \xe2\x80\x9cor she\xe2\x80\x99ll be withdrawn. Do\r\nanybody give it? The last time. Yes or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a loud voice from the doorway.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned. Standing in the triangular opening which formed\r\nthe door of the tent was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had\r\narrived there within the last two or three minutes. A dead silence\r\nfollowed his affirmation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the husband, staring at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaying is one thing, and paying is another. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sailor hesitated a moment, looked anew at the woman, came in,\r\nunfolded five crisp pieces of paper, and threw them down upon the\r\ntablecloth. They were Bank-of-England notes for five pounds. Upon the\r\nface of this he clinked down the shillings severally\xe2\x80\x94one, two, three,\r\nfour, five.\r\n\r\nThe sight of real money in full amount, in answer to a challenge for\r\nthe same till then deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon\r\nthe spectators. Their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief\r\nactors, and then upon the notes as they lay, weighted by the shillings,\r\non the table.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment it could not positively have been asserted that the\r\nman, in spite of his tantalizing declaration, was really in earnest.\r\nThe spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece\r\nof mirthful irony carried to extremes; and had assumed that, being out\r\nof work, he was, as a consequence, out of temper with the world, and\r\nsociety, and his nearest kin. But with the demand and response of real\r\ncash the jovial frivolity of the scene departed. A lurid colour seemed\r\nto fill the tent, and change the aspect of all therein. The\r\nmirth-wrinkles left the listeners\xe2\x80\x99 faces, and they waited with parting\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, breaking the silence, so that her low dry voice\r\nsounded quite loud, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you go further, Michael, listen to me. If\r\nyou touch that money, I and this girl go with the man. Mind, it is a\r\njoke no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA joke? Of course it is not a joke!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted her husband, his\r\nresentment rising at her suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cI take the money; the sailor\r\ntakes you. That\xe2\x80\x99s plain enough. It has been done elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94and why not\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis quite on the understanding that the young woman is willing,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe sailor blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt her feelings for the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, nor I,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she is willing, provided she can\r\nhave the child. She said so only the other day when I talked o\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you swear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, after glancing at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face and seeing no\r\nrepentance there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, she shall have the child, and the bargain\xe2\x80\x99s complete,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe trusser. He took the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s notes and deliberately folded them,\r\nand put them with the shillings in a high remote pocket, with an air of\r\nfinality.\r\n\r\nThe sailor looked at the woman and smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nkindly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little one too\xe2\x80\x94the more the merrier!\xe2\x80\x9d She paused for an\r\ninstant, with a close glance at him. Then dropping her eyes again, and\r\nsaying nothing, she took up the child and followed him as he made\r\ntowards the door. On reaching it, she turned, and pulling off her\r\nwedding-ring, flung it across the booth in the hay-trusser\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMike,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with thee a couple of years, and had\r\nnothing but temper! Now I\xe2\x80\x99m no more to \xe2\x80\x99ee; I\xe2\x80\x99ll try my luck elsewhere.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twill be better for me and Elizabeth-Jane, both. So good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeizing the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s arm with her right hand, and mounting the little\r\ngirl on her left, she went out of the tent sobbing bitterly.\r\n\r\nA stolid look of concern filled the husband\xe2\x80\x99s face, as if, after all,\r\nhe had not quite anticipated this ending; and some of the guests\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she gone?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, ay! she\xe2\x80\x99s gone clane enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said some rustics near the door.\r\n\r\nHe rose and walked to the entrance with the careful tread of one\r\nconscious of his alcoholic load. Some others followed, and they stood\r\nlooking into the twilight. The difference between the peacefulness of\r\ninferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent\r\nat this place. In contrast with the harshness of the act just ended\r\nwithin the tent was the sight of several horses crossing their necks\r\nand rubbing each other lovingly as they waited in patience to be\r\nharnessed for the homeward journey. Outside the fair, in the valleys\r\nand woods, all was quiet. The sun had recently set, and the west heaven\r\nwas hung with rosy cloud, which seemed permanent, yet slowly changed.\r\nTo watch it was like looking at some grand feat of stagery from a\r\ndarkened auditorium. In presence of this scene after the other there\r\nwas a natural instinct to abjure man as the blot on an otherwise kindly\r\nuniverse; till it was remembered that all terrestrial conditions were\r\nintermittent, and that mankind might some night be innocently sleeping\r\nwhen these quiet objects were raging loud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do the sailor live?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a spectator, when they had vainly\r\ngazed around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man who had seen high life. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s without\r\ndoubt a stranger here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came in about five minutes ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said the furmity woman, joining\r\nthe rest with her hands on her hips. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then \xe2\x80\x99a stepped back, and\r\nthen \xe2\x80\x99a looked in again. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a penny the better for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServes the husband well be-right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staylace vendor. \xe2\x80\x9cA comely\r\nrespectable body like her\xe2\x80\x94what can a man want more? I glory in the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s sperrit. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 done it myself\xe2\x80\x94od send if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if a\r\nhusband had behaved so to me! I\xe2\x80\x99d go, and \xe2\x80\x99a might call, and call, till\r\nhis keacorn was raw; but I\xe2\x80\x99d never come back\xe2\x80\x94no, not till the great\r\ntrumpet, would I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the woman will be better off,\xe2\x80\x9d said another of a more\r\ndeliberative turn. \xe2\x80\x9cFor seafaring natures be very good shelter for\r\nshorn lambs, and the man do seem to have plenty of money, which is what\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s not been used to lately, by all showings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go after her!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trusser, returning doggedly\r\nto his seat. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her go! If she\xe2\x80\x99s up to such vagaries she must suffer\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x99em. She\xe2\x80\x99d no business to take the maid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis my maid; and if it\r\nwere the doing again she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible\r\nproceeding, perhaps because it was late, the customers thinned away\r\nfrom the tent shortly after this episode. The man stretched his elbows\r\nforward on the table leant his face upon his arms, and soon began to\r\nsnore. The furmity seller decided to close for the night, and after\r\nseeing the rum-bottles, milk, corn, raisins, etc., that remained on\r\nhand, loaded into the cart, came to where the man reclined. She shook\r\nhim, but could not wake him. As the tent was not to be struck that\r\nnight, the fair continuing for two or three days, she decided to let\r\nthe sleeper, who was obviously no tramp, stay where he was, and his\r\nbasket with him. Extinguishing the last candle, and lowering the flap\r\nof the tent, she left it, and drove away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas when\r\nthe man awoke. A warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the\r\nmarquee, and a single big blue fly buzzed musically round and round it.\r\nBesides the buzz of the fly there was not a sound. He looked about\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe benches\xe2\x80\x94at the table supported by trestles\xe2\x80\x94at his basket of\r\ntools\xe2\x80\x94at the stove where the furmity had been boiled\xe2\x80\x94at the empty\r\nbasins\xe2\x80\x94at some shed grains of wheat\xe2\x80\x94at the corks which dotted the\r\ngrassy floor. Among the odds and ends he discerned a little shining\r\nobject, and picked it up. It was his wife\xe2\x80\x99s ring.\r\n\r\nA confused picture of the events of the previous evening seemed to come\r\nback to him, and he thrust his hand into his breast-pocket. A rustling\r\nrevealed the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s bank-notes thrust carelessly in.\r\n\r\nThis second verification of his dim memories was enough; he knew now\r\nthey were not dreams. He remained seated, looking on the ground for\r\nsome time. \xe2\x80\x9cI must get out of this as soon as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ndeliberately at last, with the air of one who could not catch his\r\nthoughts without pronouncing them. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone\xe2\x80\x94to be sure she is\xe2\x80\x94gone\r\nwith that sailor who bought her, and little Elizabeth-Jane. We walked\r\nhere, and I had the furmity, and rum in it\xe2\x80\x94and sold her. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened and here am I. Now, what am I to do\xe2\x80\x94am I sober enough\r\nto walk, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d He stood up, found that he was in fairly good\r\ncondition for progress, unencumbered. Next he shouldered his tool\r\nbasket, and found he could carry it. Then lifting the tent door he\r\nemerged into the open air.\r\n\r\nHere the man looked around with gloomy curiosity. The freshness of the\r\nSeptember morning inspired and braced him as he stood. He and his\r\nfamily had been weary when they arrived the night before, and they had\r\nobserved but little of the place; so that he now beheld it as a new\r\nthing. It exhibited itself as the top of an open down, bounded on one\r\nextreme by a plantation, and approached by a winding road. At the\r\nbottom stood the village which lent its name to the upland and the\r\nannual fair that was held thereon. The spot stretched downward into\r\nvalleys, and onward to other uplands, dotted with barrows, and trenched\r\nwith the remains of prehistoric forts. The whole scene lay under the\r\nrays of a newly risen sun, which had not as yet dried a single blade of\r\nthe heavily dewed grass, whereon the shadows of the yellow and red vans\r\nwere projected far away, those thrown by the felloe of each wheel being\r\nelongated in shape to the orbit of a comet. All the gipsies and showmen\r\nwho had remained on the ground lay snug within their carts and tents or\r\nwrapped in horse-cloths under them, and were silent and still as death,\r\nwith the exception of an occasional snore that revealed their presence.\r\nBut the Seven Sleepers had a dog; and dogs of the mysterious breeds\r\nthat vagrants own, that are as much like cats as dogs and as much like\r\nfoxes as cats also lay about here. A little one started up under one of\r\nthe carts, barked as a matter of principle, and quickly lay down again.\r\nHe was the only positive spectator of the hay-trusser\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the\r\nWeydon Fair-field.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to accord with his desire. He went on in silent thought,\r\nunheeding the yellowhammers which flitted about the hedges with straws\r\nin their bills, the crowns of the mushrooms, and the tinkling of local\r\nsheep-bells, whose wearer had had the good fortune not to be included\r\nin the fair. When he reached a lane, a good mile from the scene of the\r\nprevious evening, the man pitched his basket and leant upon a gate. A\r\ndifficult problem or two occupied his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I tell my name to anybody last night, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell my name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said to himself; and at last concluded that he did not. His general\r\ndemeanour was enough to show how he was surprised and nettled that his\r\nwife had taken him so literally\xe2\x80\x94as much could be seen in his face, and\r\nin the way he nibbled a straw which he pulled from the hedge. He knew\r\nthat she must have been somewhat excited to do this; moreover, she must\r\nhave believed that there was some sort of binding force in the\r\ntransaction. On this latter point he felt almost certain, knowing her\r\nfreedom from levity of character, and the extreme simplicity of her\r\nintellect. There may, too, have been enough recklessness and resentment\r\nbeneath her ordinary placidity to make her stifle any momentary doubts.\r\nOn a previous occasion when he had declared during a fuddle that he\r\nwould dispose of her as he had done, she had replied that she would not\r\nhear him say that many times more before it happened, in the resigned\r\ntones of a fatalist.... \xe2\x80\x9cYet she knows I am not in my senses when I do\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must walk about till I find her.... Seize\r\nher, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she know better than bring me into this disgrace!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nroared out. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t queer if I was. \xe2\x80\x99Tis like Susan to show such\r\nidiotic simplicity. Meek\xe2\x80\x94that meekness has done me more harm than the\r\nbitterest temper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was calmer he turned to his original conviction that he must\r\nsomehow find her and his little Elizabeth-Jane, and put up with the\r\nshame as best he could. It was of his own making, and he ought to bear\r\nit. But first he resolved to register an oath, a greater oath than he\r\nhad ever sworn before: and to do it properly he required a fit place\r\nand imagery; for there was something fetichistic in this man\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs.\r\n\r\nHe shouldered his basket and moved on, casting his eyes inquisitively\r\nround upon the landscape as he walked, and at the distance of three or\r\nfour miles perceived the roofs of a village and the tower of a church.\r\nHe instantly made towards the latter object. The village was quite\r\nstill, it being that motionless hour of rustic daily life which fills\r\nthe interval between the departure of the field-labourers to their\r\nwork, and the rising of their wives and daughters to prepare the\r\nbreakfast for their return. Hence he reached the church without\r\nobservation, and the door being only latched he entered. The\r\nhay-trusser deposited his basket by the font, went up the nave till he\r\nreached the altar-rails, and opening the gate entered the sacrarium,\r\nwhere he seemed to feel a sense of the strangeness for a moment; then\r\nhe knelt upon the footpace. Dropping his head upon the clamped book\r\nwhich lay on the Communion-table, he said aloud\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, Michael Henchard, on this morning of the sixteenth of September, do\r\ntake an oath before God here in this solemn place that I will avoid all\r\nstrong liquors for the space of twenty-one years to come, being a year\r\nfor every year that I have lived. And this I swear upon the book before\r\nme; and may I be strook dumb, blind, and helpless, if I break this my\r\noath!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had said it and kissed the big book, the hay-trusser arose, and\r\nseemed relieved at having made a start in a new direction. While\r\nstanding in the porch a moment he saw a thick jet of wood smoke\r\nsuddenly start up from the red chimney of a cottage near, and knew that\r\nthe occupant had just lit her fire. He went round to the door, and the\r\nhousewife agreed to prepare him some breakfast for a trifling payment,\r\nwhich was done. Then he started on the search for his wife and child.\r\n\r\nThe perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough.\r\nThough he examined and inquired, and walked hither and thither day\r\nafter day, no such characters as those he described had anywhere been\r\nseen since the evening of the fair. To add to the difficulty he could\r\ngain no sound of the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s name. As money was short with him he\r\ndecided, after some hesitation, to spend the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s money in the\r\nprosecution of this search; but it was equally in vain. The truth was\r\nthat a certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael\r\nHenchard from following up the investigation with the loud hue-and-cry\r\nsuch a pursuit demanded to render it effectual; and it was probably for\r\nthis reason that he obtained no clue, though everything was done by him\r\nthat did not involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he\r\nhad lost her.\r\n\r\nWeeks counted up to months, and still he searched on, maintaining\r\nhimself by small jobs of work in the intervals. By this time he had\r\narrived at a seaport, and there he derived intelligence that persons\r\nanswering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time\r\nbefore. Then he said he would search no longer, and that he would go\r\nand settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind.\r\n\r\nNext day he started, journeying south-westward, and did not pause,\r\nexcept for nights\xe2\x80\x99 lodgings, till he reached the town of Casterbridge,\r\nin a far distant part of Wessex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe highroad into the village of Weydon-Priors was again carpeted with\r\ndust. The trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green, and\r\nwhere the Henchard family of three had once walked along, two persons\r\nnot unconnected with the family walked now.\r\n\r\nThe scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character,\r\neven to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down, that\r\nit might for that matter have been the afternoon following the\r\npreviously recorded episode. Change was only to be observed in details;\r\nbut here it was obvious that a long procession of years had passed by.\r\nOne of the two who walked the road was she who had figured as the young\r\nwife of Henchard on the previous occasion; now her face had lost much\r\nof its rotundity; her skin had undergone a textural change; and though\r\nher hair had not lost colour it was considerably thinner than\r\nheretofore. She was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow. Her\r\ncompanion, also in black, appeared as a well-formed young woman about\r\neighteen, completely possessed of that ephemeral precious essence\r\nyouth, which is itself beauty, irrespective of complexion or contour.\r\n\r\nA glance was sufficient to inform the eye that this was Susan\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s grown-up daughter. While life\xe2\x80\x99s middle summer had set its\r\nhardening mark on the mother\xe2\x80\x99s face, her former spring-like\r\nspecialities were transferred so dexterously by Time to the second\r\nfigure, her child, that the absence of certain facts within her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge from the girl\xe2\x80\x99s mind would have seemed for the\r\nmoment, to one reflecting on those facts, to be a curious imperfection\r\nin Nature\xe2\x80\x99s powers of continuity.\r\n\r\nThey walked with joined hands, and it could be perceived that this was\r\nthe act of simple affection. The daughter carried in her outer hand a\r\nwithy basket of old-fashioned make; the mother a blue bundle, which\r\ncontrasted oddly with her black stuff gown.\r\n\r\nReaching the outskirts of the village they pursued the same track as\r\nformerly, and ascended to the fair. Here, too it was evident that the\r\nyears had told. Certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed\r\nin the roundabouts and high-fliers, machines for testing rustic\r\nstrength and weight, and in the erections devoted to shooting for nuts.\r\nBut the real business of the fair had considerably dwindled. The new\r\nperiodical great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning to\r\ninterfere seriously with the trade carried on here for centuries. The\r\npens for sheep, the tie-ropes for horses, were about half as long as\r\nthey had been. The stalls of tailors, hosiers, coopers, linen-drapers,\r\nand other such trades had almost disappeared, and the vehicles were far\r\nless numerous. The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some\r\nlittle distance, and then stood still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did we hinder our time by coming in here? I thought you wished to\r\nget onward?\xe2\x80\x9d said the maiden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear Elizabeth-Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the other. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had a fancy\r\nfor looking up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was here I first met with Newson\xe2\x80\x94on such a day as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst met with father here? Yes, you have told me so before. And now\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s drowned and gone from us!\xe2\x80\x9d As she spoke the girl drew a card from\r\nher pocket and looked at it with a sigh. It was edged with black, and\r\ninscribed within a design resembling a mural tablet were the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\naffectionate memory of Richard Newson, mariner, who was unfortunately\r\nlost at sea, in the month of November 184\xe2\x80\x94, aged forty-one years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it was here,\xe2\x80\x9d continued her mother, with more hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nlast saw the relation we are going to look for\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Michael Henchard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is his exact kin to us, mother? I have never clearly had it told\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, or was\xe2\x80\x94for he may be dead\xe2\x80\x94a connection by marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said her\r\nmother deliberately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you have said a score of times before!\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe young woman, looking about her inattentively. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not a near\r\nrelation, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by any means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a hay-trusser, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he, when you last heard of him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he never knew me?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl innocently continued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henchard paused for a moment, and answered uneasily, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nnot, Elizabeth-Jane. But come this way.\xe2\x80\x9d She moved on to another part\r\nof the field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not much use inquiring here for anybody, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ndaughter observed, as she gazed round about. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople at fairs change\r\nlike the leaves of trees; and I daresay you are the only one here\r\nto-day who was here all those years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Newson, as she now called\r\nherself, keenly eyeing something under a green bank a little way off.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe daughter looked in the direction signified. The object pointed out\r\nwas a tripod of sticks stuck into the earth, from which hung a\r\nthree-legged crock, kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath. Over\r\nthe pot stooped an old woman haggard, wrinkled, and almost in rags. She\r\nstirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon, and occasionally\r\ncroaked in a broken voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGood furmity sold here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tent\xe2\x80\x94once thriving,\r\ncleanly, white-aproned, and chinking with money\xe2\x80\x94now tentless, dirty,\r\nowning no tables or benches, and having scarce any customers except two\r\nsmall whity-brown boys, who came up and asked for \xe2\x80\x9cA ha\xe2\x80\x99p\xe2\x80\x99orth,\r\nplease\xe2\x80\x94good measure,\xe2\x80\x9d which she served in a couple of chipped yellow\r\nbasins of commonest clay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was here at that time,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mrs. Newson, making a step as if\r\nto draw nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to her\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t respectable!\xe2\x80\x9d urged the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will just say a word\xe2\x80\x94you, Elizabeth-Jane, can stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl was not loth, and turned to some stalls of coloured prints\r\nwhile her mother went forward. The old woman begged for the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncustom as soon as she saw her, and responded to Mrs. Henchard-Newson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest for a pennyworth with more alacrity than she had shown in\r\nselling six-pennyworths in her younger days. When the _soi-disant_\r\nwidow had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich\r\nconcoction of the former time, the hag opened a little basket behind\r\nthe fire, and looking up slily, whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cJust a thought o\xe2\x80\x99 rum in\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94smuggled, you know\xe2\x80\x94say two penn\xe2\x80\x99orth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twill make it slip down like\r\ncordial!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick, and\r\nshook her head with a meaning the old woman was far from translating.\r\nShe pretended to eat a little of the furmity with the leaden spoon\r\noffered, and as she did so said blandly to the hag, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen better\r\ndays?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94well ye may say it!\xe2\x80\x9d responded the old woman, opening the\r\nsluices of her heart forthwith. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve stood in this fair-ground, maid,\r\nwife, and widow, these nine-and-thirty years, and in that time have\r\nknown what it was to do business with the richest stomachs in the land!\r\nMa\xe2\x80\x99am you\xe2\x80\x99d hardly believe that I was once the owner of a great\r\npavilion-tent that was the attraction of the fair. Nobody could come,\r\nnobody could go, without having a dish of Mrs. Goodenough\xe2\x80\x99s furmity. I\r\nknew the clergy\xe2\x80\x99s taste, the dandy gent\xe2\x80\x99s taste; I knew the town\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntaste, the country\xe2\x80\x99s taste. I even knowed the taste of the coarse\r\nshameless females. But Lord\xe2\x80\x99s my life\xe2\x80\x94the world\xe2\x80\x99s no memory;\r\nstraightforward dealings don\xe2\x80\x99t bring profit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis the sly and the\r\nunderhand that get on in these times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Newson glanced round\xe2\x80\x94her daughter was still bending over the\r\ndistant stalls. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you call to mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said cautiously to the old\r\nwoman, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years\r\nago to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hag reflected, and half shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been a big thing\r\nI should have minded it in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can mind every\r\nserious fight o\xe2\x80\x99 married parties, every murder, every manslaughter,\r\neven every pocket-picking\xe2\x80\x94leastwise large ones\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x99t has been my lot\r\nto witness. But a selling? Was it done quiet-like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes. I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe furmity woman half shook her head again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndo. At any rate, I can mind a man doing something o\xe2\x80\x99 the sort\xe2\x80\x94a man in\r\na cord jacket, with a basket of tools; but, Lord bless ye, we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngi\xe2\x80\x99e it head-room, we don\xe2\x80\x99t, such as that. The only reason why I can\r\nmind the man is that he came back here to the next year\xe2\x80\x99s fair, and\r\ntold me quite private-like that if a woman ever asked for him I was to\r\nsay he had gone to\xe2\x80\x94where?\xe2\x80\x94Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94to Casterbridge, said he.\r\nBut, Lord\xe2\x80\x99s my life, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought of it again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small means\r\nafforded had she not discreetly borne in mind that it was by that\r\nunscrupulous person\xe2\x80\x99s liquor her husband had been degraded. She briefly\r\nthanked her informant, and rejoined Elizabeth, who greeted her with,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, do let\xe2\x80\x99s get on\xe2\x80\x94it was hardly respectable for you to buy\r\nrefreshments there. I see none but the lowest do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have learned what I wanted, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nlast time our relative visited this fair he said he was living at\r\nCasterbridge. It is a long, long way from here, and it was many years\r\nago that he said it, but there I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this they descended out of the fair, and went onward to the\r\nvillage, where they obtained a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s wife acted for the best, but she had involved herself in\r\ndifficulties. A hundred times she had been upon the point of telling\r\nher daughter Elizabeth-Jane the true story of her life, the tragical\r\ncrisis of which had been the transaction at Weydon Fair, when she was\r\nnot much older than the girl now beside her. But she had refrained. An\r\ninnocent maiden had thus grown up in the belief that the relations\r\nbetween the genial sailor and her mother were the ordinary ones that\r\nthey had always appeared to be. The risk of endangering a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrong affection by disturbing ideas which had grown with her growth\r\nwas to Mrs. Henchard too fearful a thing to contemplate. It had seemed,\r\nindeed folly to think of making Elizabeth-Jane wise.\r\n\r\nBut Susan Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s fear of losing her dearly loved daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nby a revelation had little to do with any sense of wrong-doing on her\r\nown part. Her simplicity\xe2\x80\x94the original ground of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94had allowed her to live on in the conviction that Newson had\r\nacquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his\r\npurchase\xe2\x80\x94though the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were\r\nvague. It may seem strange to sophisticated minds that a sane young\r\nmatron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer; and were\r\nthere not numerous other instances of the same belief the thing might\r\nscarcely be credited. But she was by no means the first or last peasant\r\nwoman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser, as too many rural\r\nrecords show.\r\n\r\nThe history of Susan Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s adventures in the interim can be told\r\nin two or three sentences. Absolutely helpless she had been taken off\r\nto Canada where they had lived several years without any great worldly\r\nsuccess, though she worked as hard as any woman could to keep their\r\ncottage cheerful and well-provided. When Elizabeth-Jane was about\r\ntwelve years old the three returned to England, and settled at\r\nFalmouth, where Newson made a living for a few years as boatman and\r\ngeneral handy shoreman.\r\n\r\nHe then engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and it was during this\r\nperiod that Susan had an awakening. A friend to whom she confided her\r\nhistory ridiculed her grave acceptance of her position; and all was\r\nover with her peace of mind. When Newson came home at the end of one\r\nwinter he saw that the delusion he had so carefully sustained had\r\nvanished for ever.\r\n\r\nThere was then a time of sadness, in which she told him her doubts if\r\nshe could live with him longer. Newson left home again on the\r\nNewfoundland trade when the season came round. The vague news of his\r\nloss at sea a little later on solved a problem which had become torture\r\nto her meek conscience. She saw him no more.\r\n\r\nOf Henchard they heard nothing. To the liege subjects of Labour, the\r\nEngland of those days was a continent, and a mile a geographical\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane developed early into womanliness. One day a month or so\r\nafter receiving intelligence of Newson\xe2\x80\x99s death off the Bank of\r\nNewfoundland, when the girl was about eighteen, she was sitting on a\r\nwillow chair in the cottage they still occupied, working twine nets for\r\nthe fishermen. Her mother was in a back corner of the same room engaged\r\nin the same labour, and dropping the heavy wood needle she was filling\r\nshe surveyed her daughter thoughtfully. The sun shone in at the door\r\nupon the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s head and hair, which was worn loose, so that the\r\nrays streamed into its depths as into a hazel copse. Her face, though\r\nsomewhat wan and incomplete, possessed the raw materials of beauty in a\r\npromising degree. There was an under-handsomeness in it, struggling to\r\nreveal itself through the provisional curves of immaturity, and the\r\ncasual disfigurements that resulted from the straitened circumstances\r\nof their lives. She was handsome in the bone, hardly as yet handsome in\r\nthe flesh. She possibly might never be fully handsome, unless the\r\ncarking accidents of her daily existence could be evaded before the\r\nmobile parts of her countenance had settled to their final mould.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the girl made her mother sad\xe2\x80\x94not vaguely but by logical\r\ninference. They both were still in that strait-waistcoat of poverty\r\nfrom which she had tried so many times to be delivered for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. The woman had long perceived how zealously and constantly the\r\nyoung mind of her companion was struggling for enlargement; and yet\r\nnow, in her eighteenth year, it still remained but little unfolded. The\r\ndesire\xe2\x80\x94sober and repressed\xe2\x80\x94of Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s heart was indeed to see,\r\nto hear, and to understand. How could she become a woman of wider\r\nknowledge, higher repute\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbetter,\xe2\x80\x9d as she termed it\xe2\x80\x94this was her\r\nconstant inquiry of her mother. She sought further into things than\r\nother girls in her position ever did, and her mother groaned as she\r\nfelt she could not aid in the search.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, drowned or no, was probably now lost to them; and Susan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstaunch, religious adherence to him as her husband in principle, till\r\nher views had been disturbed by enlightenment, was demanded no more.\r\nShe asked herself whether the present moment, now that she was a free\r\nwoman again, were not as opportune a one as she would find in a world\r\nwhere everything had been so inopportune, for making a desperate effort\r\nto advance Elizabeth. To pocket her pride and search for the first\r\nhusband seemed, wisely or not, the best initiatory step. He had\r\npossibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might, on the other hand,\r\nhave had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been\r\ngiven to bouts only, and was not a habitual drunkard.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the propriety of returning to him, if he lived, was\r\nunquestionable. The awkwardness of searching for him lay in\r\nenlightening Elizabeth, a proceeding which her mother could not endure\r\nto contemplate. She finally resolved to undertake the search without\r\nconfiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard, leaving it to\r\nhim if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end.\r\nThis will account for their conversation at the fair and the\r\nhalf-informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward.\r\n\r\nIn this attitude they proceeded on their journey, trusting solely to\r\nthe dim light afforded of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts by the furmity woman.\r\nThe strictest economy was indispensable. Sometimes they might have been\r\nseen on foot, sometimes on farmers\xe2\x80\x99 waggons, sometimes in carriers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nvans; and thus they drew near to Casterbridge. Elizabeth-Jane\r\ndiscovered to her alarm that her mother\xe2\x80\x99s health was not what it once\r\nhad been, and there was ever and anon in her talk that renunciatory\r\ntone which showed that, but for the girl, she would not be very sorry\r\nto quit a life she was growing thoroughly weary of.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Friday evening, near the middle of September and just\r\nbefore dusk, that they reached the summit of a hill within a mile of\r\nthe place they sought. There were high banked hedges to the coach-road\r\nhere, and they mounted upon the green turf within, and sat down. The\r\nspot commanded a full view of the town and its environs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an old-fashioned place it seems to be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane,\r\nwhile her silent mother mused on other things than topography. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nhuddled all together; and it is shut in by a square wall of trees, like\r\na plot of garden ground by a box-edging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIts squareness was, indeed, the characteristic which most struck the\r\neye in this antiquated borough, the borough of Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94at that\r\ntime, recent as it was, untouched by the faintest sprinkle of\r\nmodernism. It was compact as a box of dominoes. It had no suburbs\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe ordinary sense. Country and town met at a mathematical line.\r\n\r\nTo birds of the more soaring kind Casterbridge must have appeared on\r\nthis fine evening as a mosaic-work of subdued reds, browns, greys, and\r\ncrystals, held together by a rectangular frame of deep green. To the\r\nlevel eye of humanity it stood as an indistinct mass behind a dense\r\nstockade of limes and chestnuts, set in the midst of miles of rotund\r\ndown and concave field. The mass became gradually dissected by the\r\nvision into towers, gables, chimneys, and casements, the highest\r\nglazings shining bleared and bloodshot with the coppery fire they\r\ncaught from the belt of sunlit cloud in the west.\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of each side of this tree-bound square ran avenues\r\neast, west, and south into the wide expanse of cornland and coomb to\r\nthe distance of a mile or so. It was by one of these avenues that the\r\npedestrians were about to enter. Before they had risen to proceed two\r\nmen passed outside the hedge, engaged in argumentative conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, surely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, as they receded, \xe2\x80\x9cthose men mentioned\r\nthe name of Henchard in their talk\xe2\x80\x94the name of our relative?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Newson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat seems a hint to us that he is still here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I run after them, and ask them about him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no! Not for the world just yet. He may be in the workhouse, or\r\nin the stocks, for all we know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me\xe2\x80\x94why should you think that, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas just something to say\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all! But we must make private\r\ninquiries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving sufficiently rested they proceeded on their way at evenfall. The\r\ndense trees of the avenue rendered the road dark as a tunnel, though\r\nthe open land on each side was still under a faint daylight, in other\r\nwords, they passed down a midnight between two gloamings. The features\r\nof the town had a keen interest for Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s mother, now that the\r\nhuman side came to the fore. As soon as they had wandered about they\r\ncould see that the stockade of gnarled trees which framed in\r\nCasterbridge was itself an avenue, standing on a low green bank or\r\nescarpment, with a ditch yet visible without. Within the avenue and\r\nbank was a wall more or less discontinuous, and within the wall were\r\npacked the abodes of the burghers.\r\n\r\nThough the two women did not know it these external features were but\r\nthe ancient defences of the town, planted as a promenade.\r\n\r\nThe lamplights now glimmered through the engirdling trees, conveying a\r\nsense of great smugness and comfort inside, and rendering at the same\r\ntime the unlighted country without strangely solitary and vacant in\r\naspect, considering its nearness to life. The difference between burgh\r\nand champaign was increased, too, by sounds which now reached them\r\nabove others\xe2\x80\x94the notes of a brass band. The travellers returned into\r\nthe High Street, where there were timber houses with overhanging\r\nstories, whose small-paned lattices were screened by dimity curtains on\r\na drawing-string, and under whose bargeboards old cobwebs waved in the\r\nbreeze. There were houses of brick-nogging, which derived their chief\r\nsupport from those adjoining. There were slate roofs patched with\r\ntiles, and tile roofs patched with slate, with occasionally a roof of\r\nthatch.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural and pastoral character of the people upon whom the\r\ntown depended for its existence was shown by the class of objects\r\ndisplayed in the shop windows. Scythes, reap-hooks, sheep-shears,\r\nbill-hooks, spades, mattocks, and hoes at the iron-monger\xe2\x80\x99s; bee-hives,\r\nbutter-firkins, churns, milking stools and pails, hay-rakes,\r\nfield-flagons, and seed-lips at the cooper\xe2\x80\x99s; cart-ropes and\r\nplough-harness at the saddler\xe2\x80\x99s; carts, wheel-barrows, and mill-gear at\r\nthe wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s and machinist\xe2\x80\x99s, horse-embrocations at the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nat the glover\xe2\x80\x99s and leather-cutter\xe2\x80\x99s, hedging-gloves, thatchers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknee-caps, ploughmen\xe2\x80\x99s leggings, villagers\xe2\x80\x99 pattens and clogs.\r\n\r\nThey came to a grizzled church, whose massive square tower rose\r\nunbroken into the darkening sky, the lower parts being illuminated by\r\nthe nearest lamps sufficiently to show how completely the mortar from\r\nthe joints of the stonework had been nibbled out by time and weather,\r\nwhich had planted in the crevices thus made little tufts of stone-crop\r\nand grass almost as far up as the very battlements. From this tower the\r\nclock struck eight, and thereupon a bell began to toll with a\r\nperemptory clang. The curfew was still rung in Casterbridge, and it was\r\nutilized by the inhabitants as a signal for shutting their shops. No\r\nsooner did the deep notes of the bell throb between the house-fronts\r\nthan a clatter of shutters arose through the whole length of the High\r\nStreet. In a few minutes business at Casterbridge was ended for the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOther clocks struck eight from time to time\xe2\x80\x94one gloomily from the gaol,\r\nanother from the gable of an almshouse, with a preparative creak of\r\nmachinery, more audible than the note of the bell; a row of tall,\r\nvarnished case-clocks from the interior of a clock-maker\xe2\x80\x99s shop joined\r\nin one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them, like a\r\nrow of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the\r\ncurtain; then chimes were heard stammering out the Sicilian Mariners\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHymn; so that chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably on\r\ntheir way to the next hour before the whole business of the old one was\r\nsatisfactorily wound up.\r\n\r\nIn an open space before the church walked a woman with her gown-sleeves\r\nrolled up so high that the edge of her underlinen was visible, and her\r\nskirt tucked up through her pocket hole. She carried a loaf under her\r\narm from which she was pulling pieces of bread, and handing them to\r\nsome other women who walked with her, which pieces they nibbled\r\ncritically. The sight reminded Mrs. Henchard-Newson and her daughter\r\nthat they had an appetite; and they inquired of the woman for the\r\nnearest baker\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe may as well look for manna-food as good bread in Casterbridge just\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after directing them. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can blare their trumpets\r\nand thump their drums, and have their roaring dinners\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94waving her hand\r\ntowards a point further along the street, where the brass band could be\r\nseen standing in front of an illuminated building\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut we must needs be\r\nput-to for want of a wholesome crust. There\xe2\x80\x99s less good bread than good\r\nbeer in Casterbridge now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd less good beer than swipes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a man with his hands in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does it happen there\xe2\x80\x99s no good bread?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis the corn-factor\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s the man that our millers and bakers all\r\ndeal wi\xe2\x80\x99, and he has sold \xe2\x80\x99em growed wheat, which they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know was\r\ngrowed, so they say, till the dough ran all over the ovens like\r\nquicksilver; so that the loaves be as flat as toads, and like suet\r\npudden inside. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a wife, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a mother, and I never\r\nsee such unprincipled bread in Casterbridge as this before.\xe2\x80\x94But you\r\nmust be a real stranger here not to know what\xe2\x80\x99s made all the poor\r\nvolks\xe2\x80\x99 insides plim like blowed bladders this week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s mother shyly.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to be observed further till she knew more of her future in\r\nthis place, she withdrew with her daughter from the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\nGetting a couple of biscuits at the shop indicated as a temporary\r\nsubstitute for a meal, they next bent their steps instinctively to\r\nwhere the music was playing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nA few score yards brought them to the spot where the town band was now\r\nshaking the window-panes with the strains of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Roast Beef of Old\r\nEngland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe building before whose doors they had pitched their music-stands was\r\nthe chief hotel in Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94namely, the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms. A spacious\r\nbow-window projected into the street over the main portico, and from\r\nthe open sashes came the babble of voices, the jingle of glasses, and\r\nthe drawing of corks. The blinds, moreover, being left unclosed, the\r\nwhole interior of this room could be surveyed from the top of a flight\r\nof stone steps to the road-waggon office opposite, for which reason a\r\nknot of idlers had gathered there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might, perhaps, after all, make a few inquiries about\xe2\x80\x94our relation\r\nMr. Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mrs. Newson who, since her entry into\r\nCasterbridge, had seemed strangely weak and agitated, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd this, I\r\nthink, would be a good place for trying it\xe2\x80\x94just to ask, you know, how\r\nhe stands in the town\xe2\x80\x94if he is here, as I think he must be. You,\r\nElizabeth-Jane, had better be the one to do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m too worn out to do\r\nanything\xe2\x80\x94pull down your fall first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat down upon the lowest step, and Elizabeth-Jane obeyed her\r\ndirections and stood among the idlers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the girl, after singling out an old\r\nman and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of\r\nconverse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye must be a stranger sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, without taking\r\nhis eyes from the window. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99tis a great public dinner of the\r\ngentle-people and such like leading volk\xe2\x80\x94wi\xe2\x80\x99 the Mayor in the chair. As\r\nwe plainer fellows bain\xe2\x80\x99t invited, they leave the winder-shutters open\r\nthat we may get jist a sense o\xe2\x80\x99t out here. If you mount the steps you\r\ncan see em. That\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table, a\r\nfacing ye; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the Council men right and left.... Ah, lots of\r\nthem when they begun life were no more than I be now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHenchard!\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting\r\nthe whole force of the revelation. She ascended to the top of the\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nHer mother, though her head was bowed, had already caught from the\r\ninn-window tones that strangely riveted her attention, before the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henchard, the Mayor,\xe2\x80\x9d reached her ears. She arose,\r\nand stepped up to her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s side as soon as she could do so\r\nwithout showing exceptional eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the hotel dining-room was spread out before her, with\r\nits tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates. Facing the window, in\r\nthe chair of dignity, sat a man about forty years of age; of heavy\r\nframe, large features, and commanding voice; his general build being\r\nrather coarse than compact. He had a rich complexion, which verged on\r\nswarthiness, a flashing black eye, and dark, bushy brows and hair. When\r\nhe indulged in an occasional loud laugh at some remark among the\r\nguests, his large mouth parted so far back as to show to the rays of\r\nthe chandelier a full score or more of the two-and-thirty sound white\r\nteeth that he obviously still could boast of.\r\n\r\nThat laugh was not encouraging to strangers, and hence it may have been\r\nwell that it was rarely heard. Many theories might have been built upon\r\nit. It fell in well with conjectures of a temperament which would have\r\nno pity for weakness, but would be ready to yield ungrudging admiration\r\nto greatness and strength. Its producer\xe2\x80\x99s personal goodness, if he had\r\nany, would be of a very fitful cast\xe2\x80\x94an occasional almost oppressive\r\ngenerosity rather than a mild and constant kindness.\r\n\r\nSusan Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s husband\xe2\x80\x94in law, at least\xe2\x80\x94sat before them, matured in\r\nshape, stiffened in line, exaggerated in traits; disciplined,\r\nthought-marked\xe2\x80\x94in a word, older. Elizabeth, encumbered with no\r\nrecollections as her mother was, regarded him with nothing more than\r\nthe keen curiosity and interest which the discovery of such unexpected\r\nsocial standing in the long-sought relative naturally begot. He was\r\ndressed in an old-fashioned evening suit, an expanse of frilled shirt\r\nshowing on his broad breast; jewelled studs, and a heavy gold chain.\r\nThree glasses stood at his right hand; but, to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, the\r\ntwo for wine were empty, while the third, a tumbler, was half full of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhen last she had seen him he was sitting in a corduroy jacket, fustian\r\nwaistcoat and breeches, and tanned leather leggings, with a basin of\r\nhot furmity before him. Time, the magician, had wrought much here.\r\nWatching him, and thus thinking of past days, she became so moved that\r\nshe shrank back against the jamb of the waggon-office doorway to which\r\nthe steps gave access, the shadow from it conveniently hiding her\r\nfeatures. She forgot her daughter till a touch from Elizabeth-Jane\r\naroused her. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her companion hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen him, and it is\r\nenough for me! Now I only want to go\xe2\x80\x94pass away\xe2\x80\x94die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94O what?\xe2\x80\x9d She drew closer, and whispered in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s ear, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes\r\nhe seem to you not likely to befriend us? I thought he looked a\r\ngenerous man. What a gentleman he is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? and how his diamond\r\nstuds shine! How strange that you should have said he might be in the\r\nstocks, or in the workhouse, or dead! Did ever anything go more by\r\ncontraries! Why do you feel so afraid of him? I am not at all; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall upon him\xe2\x80\x94he can but say he don\xe2\x80\x99t own such remote kin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know at all\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what to set about. I feel so down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be that, mother, now we have got here and all! Rest there where\r\nyou be a little while\xe2\x80\x94I will look on and find out more about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can ever meet Mr. Henchard. He is not how I thought he\r\nwould be\xe2\x80\x94he overpowers me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see him any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wait a little time and consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane had never been so much interested in anything in her\r\nlife as in their present position, partly from the natural elation she\r\nfelt at discovering herself akin to a coach; and she gazed again at the\r\nscene. The younger guests were talking and eating with animation; their\r\nelders were searching for titbits, and sniffing and grunting over their\r\nplates like sows nuzzling for acorns. Three drinks seemed to be sacred\r\nto the company\xe2\x80\x94port, sherry, and rum; outside which old-established\r\ntrinity few or no palates ranged.\r\n\r\nA row of ancient rummers with ground figures on their sides, and each\r\nprimed with a spoon, was now placed down the table, and these were\r\npromptly filled with grog at such high temperatures as to raise serious\r\nconsiderations for the articles exposed to its vapours. But\r\nElizabeth-Jane noticed that, though this filling went on with great\r\npromptness up and down the table, nobody filled the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s glass, who\r\nstill drank large quantities of water from the tumbler behind the clump\r\nof crystal vessels intended for wine and spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t fill Mr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s wine-glasses,\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured to say to\r\nher elbow acquaintance, the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no; don\xe2\x80\x99t ye know him to be the celebrated abstaining worthy of\r\nthat name? He scorns all tempting liquors; never touches nothing. O\r\nyes, he\xe2\x80\x99ve strong qualities that way. I have heard tell that he sware a\r\ngospel oath in bygone times, and has bode by it ever since. So they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t press him, knowing it would be unbecoming in the face of that:\r\nfor yer gospel oath is a serious thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother elderly man, hearing this discourse, now joined in by\r\ninquiring, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much longer have he got to suffer from it, Solomon\r\nLongways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother two year, they say. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the why and the wherefore of\r\nhis fixing such a time, for \xe2\x80\x99a never has told anybody. But \xe2\x80\x99tis exactly\r\ntwo calendar years longer, they say. A powerful mind to hold out so\r\nlong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue.... But there\xe2\x80\x99s great strength in hope. Knowing that in\r\nfour-and-twenty months\xe2\x80\x99 time ye\xe2\x80\x99ll be out of your bondage, and able to\r\nmake up for all you\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered, by partaking without stint\xe2\x80\x94why, it\r\nkeeps a man up, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, Christopher Coney, no doubt. And \xe2\x80\x99a must need such\r\nreflections\xe2\x80\x94a lonely widow man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Longways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did he lose his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knowed her. \xe2\x80\x99Twas afore he came to Casterbridge,\xe2\x80\x9d Solomon\r\nLongways replied with terminative emphasis, as if the fact of his\r\nignorance of Mrs. Henchard were sufficient to deprive her history of\r\nall interest. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know that \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99s a banded teetotaller, and that if\r\nany of his men be ever so little overtook by a drop he\xe2\x80\x99s down upon \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nas stern as the Lord upon the jovial Jews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he many men, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany! Why, my good maid, he\xe2\x80\x99s the powerfullest member of the Town\r\nCouncil, and quite a principal man in the country round besides. Never\r\na big dealing in wheat, barley, oats, hay, roots, and such-like but\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s got a hand in it. Ay, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll go into other things too;\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s where he makes his mistake. He worked his way up from\r\nnothing when \xe2\x80\x99a came here; and now he\xe2\x80\x99s a pillar of the town. Not but\r\nwhat he\xe2\x80\x99s been shaken a little to-year about this bad corn he has\r\nsupplied in his contracts. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the sun rise over Durnover Moor\r\nthese nine-and-sixty year, and though Mr. Henchard has never cussed me\r\nunfairly ever since I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for\xe2\x80\x99n, seeing I be but a little small\r\nman, I must say that I have never before tasted such rough bread as has\r\nbeen made from Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s wheat lately. \xe2\x80\x99Tis that growed out that ye\r\ncould a\xe2\x80\x99most call it malt, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a list at bottom o\xe2\x80\x99 the loaf as\r\nthick as the sole of one\xe2\x80\x99s shoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe band now struck up another melody, and by the time it was ended the\r\ndinner was over, and speeches began to be made. The evening being calm,\r\nand the windows still open, these orations could be distinctly heard.\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s voice arose above the rest; he was telling a story of his\r\nhay-dealing experiences, in which he had outwitted a sharper who had\r\nbeen bent upon outwitting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d responded his audience at the upshot of the story; and\r\nhilarity was general till a new voice arose with, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very\r\nwell; but how about the bad bread?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt came from the lower end of the table, where there sat a group of\r\nminor tradesmen who, although part of the company, appeared to be a\r\nlittle below the social level of the others; and who seemed to nourish\r\na certain independence of opinion and carry on discussions not quite in\r\nharmony with those at the head; just as the west end of a church is\r\nsometimes persistently found to sing out of time and tune with the\r\nleading spirits in the chancel.\r\n\r\nThis interruption about the bad bread afforded infinite satisfaction to\r\nthe loungers outside, several of whom were in the mood which finds its\r\npleasure in others\xe2\x80\x99 discomfiture; and hence they echoed pretty freely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey! How about the bad bread, Mr. Mayor?\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, feeling none of\r\nthe restraints of those who shared the feast, they could afford to add,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rather ought to tell the story o\xe2\x80\x99 that, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interruption was sufficient to compel the Mayor to notice it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I admit that the wheat turned out badly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was\r\ntaken in in buying it as much as the bakers who bought it o\xe2\x80\x99 me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the poor folk who had to eat it whether or no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ninharmonious man outside the window.\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened. There was temper under the thin bland\r\nsurface\xe2\x80\x94the temper which, artificially intensified, had banished a wife\r\nnearly a score of years before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must make allowances for the accidents of a large business,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must bear in mind that the weather just at the harvest of\r\nthat corn was worse than we have known it for years. However, I have\r\nmended my arrangements on account o\xe2\x80\x99t. Since I have found my business\r\ntoo large to be well looked after by myself alone, I have advertised\r\nfor a thorough good man as manager of the corn department. When I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot him you will find these mistakes will no longer occur\xe2\x80\x94matters will\r\nbe better looked into.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you going to do to repay us for the past?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the\r\nman who had before spoken, and who seemed to be a baker or miller.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you replace the grown flour we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got by sound grain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s face had become still more stern at these interruptions, and\r\nhe drank from his tumbler of water as if to calm himself or gain time.\r\nInstead of vouchsafing a direct reply, he stiffly observed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anybody will tell me how to turn grown wheat into wholesome wheat\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take it back with pleasure. But it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard was not to be drawn again. Having said this, he sat down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nNow the group outside the window had within the last few minutes been\r\nreinforced by new arrivals, some of them respectable shopkeepers and\r\ntheir assistants, who had come out for a whiff of air after putting up\r\nthe shutters for the night; some of them of a lower class. Distinct\r\nfrom either there appeared a stranger\xe2\x80\x94a young man of remarkably\r\npleasant aspect\xe2\x80\x94who carried in his hand a carpet-bag of the smart\r\nfloral pattern prevalent in such articles at that time.\r\n\r\nHe was ruddy and of a fair countenance, bright-eyed, and slight in\r\nbuild. He might possibly have passed by without stopping at all, or at\r\nmost for half a minute to glance in at the scene, had not his advent\r\ncoincided with the discussion on corn and bread, in which event this\r\nhistory had never been enacted. But the subject seemed to arrest him,\r\nand he whispered some inquiries of the other bystanders, and remained\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s closing words, \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled\r\nimpulsively, drew out his pocketbook, and wrote down a few words by the\r\naid of the light in the window. He tore out the leaf, folded and\r\ndirected it, and seemed about to throw it in through the open sash upon\r\nthe dining-table; but, on second thoughts, edged himself through the\r\nloiterers, till he reached the door of the hotel, where one of the\r\nwaiters who had been serving inside was now idly leaning against the\r\ndoorpost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive this to the Mayor at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing in his hasty note.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane had seen his movements and heard the words, which\r\nattracted her both by their subject and by their accent\xe2\x80\x94a strange one\r\nfor those parts. It was quaint and northerly.\r\n\r\nThe waiter took the note, while the young stranger continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that\xe2\x80\x99s a little more\r\nmoderate than this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say the Three Mariners, just below here, is a very good place,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe languidly answered; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have never stayed there myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman, as he seemed to be, thanked him, and strolled on in the\r\ndirection of the Three Mariners aforesaid, apparently more concerned\r\nabout the question of an inn than about the fate of his note, now that\r\nthe momentary impulse of writing it was over. While he was disappearing\r\nslowly down the street the waiter left the door, and Elizabeth-Jane saw\r\nwith some interest the note brought into the dining-room and handed to\r\nthe Mayor.\r\n\r\nHenchard looked at it carelessly, unfolded it with one hand, and\r\nglanced it through. Thereupon it was curious to note an unexpected\r\neffect. The nettled, clouded aspect which had held possession of his\r\nface since the subject of his corn-dealings had been broached, changed\r\nitself into one of arrested attention. He read the note slowly, and\r\nfell into thought, not moody, but fitfully intense, as that of a man\r\nwho has been captured by an idea.\r\n\r\nBy this time toasts and speeches had given place to songs, the wheat\r\nsubject being quite forgotten. Men were putting their heads together in\r\ntwos and threes, telling good stories, with pantomimic laughter which\r\nreached convulsive grimace. Some were beginning to look as if they did\r\nnot know how they had come there, what they had come for, or how they\r\nwere going to get home again; and provisionally sat on with a dazed\r\nsmile. Square-built men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks; men\r\nwith a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure, in\r\nwhich their features grew disarranged and one-sided, whilst the heads\r\nof a few who had dined with extreme thoroughness were somehow sinking\r\ninto their shoulders, the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent\r\nupwards by the subsidence. Only Henchard did not conform to these\r\nflexuous changes; he remained stately and vertical, silently thinking.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck nine. Elizabeth-Jane turned to her companion. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nevening is drawing on, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you propose to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmust get a place to lie down in,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nHenchard; and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I wanted to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough for to-night, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d Elizabeth-Jane replied\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The\r\nquestion now is\xe2\x80\x94is it not?\xe2\x80\x94how shall we find a lodging?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mind reverted to the words\r\nof the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges.\r\nA recommendation good for one person was probably good for another.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go where the young man has gone to,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\nrespectable. What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer mother assented, and down the street they went.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtfulness, engendered by the note as\r\nstated, continued to hold him in abstraction; till, whispering to his\r\nneighbour to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair.\r\nThis was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nOutside the door of the assembly-room he saw the waiter, and beckoning\r\nto him asked who had brought the note which had been handed in a\r\nquarter of an hour before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young man, sir\xe2\x80\x94a sort of traveller. He was a Scotchman seemingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say how he had got it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote it himself, sir, as he stood outside the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94wrote it himself.... Is the young man in the hotel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. He went to the Three Mariners, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands\r\nunder his coat tails, as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere\r\nthan that of the room he had quitted. But there could be no doubt that\r\nhe was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever\r\nthat might be. At length he went back to the door of the dining-room,\r\npaused, and found that the songs, toasts, and conversation were\r\nproceeding quite satisfactorily without his presence. The Corporation,\r\nprivate residents, and major and minor tradesmen had, in fact, gone in\r\nfor comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite\r\nforgotten, not only the Mayor, but all those vast, political,\r\nreligious, and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain\r\nin the daytime, and which separated them like iron grills. Seeing this\r\nthe Mayor took his hat, and when the waiter had helped him on with a\r\nthin holland overcoat, went out and stood under the portico.\r\n\r\nVery few persons were now in the street; and his eyes, by a sort of\r\nattraction, turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further\r\ndown. It was the house to which the writer of the note had gone\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nThree Mariners\xe2\x80\x94whose two prominent Elizabethan gables, bow-window, and\r\npassage-light could be seen from where he stood. Having kept his eyes\r\non it for a while he strolled in that direction.\r\n\r\nThis ancient house of accommodation for man and beast, now,\r\nunfortunately, pulled down, was built of mellow sandstone, with\r\nmullioned windows of the same material, markedly out of perpendicular\r\nfrom the settlement of foundations. The bay window projecting into the\r\nstreet, whose interior was so popular among the frequenters of the inn,\r\nwas closed with shutters, in each of which appeared a heart-shaped\r\naperture, somewhat more attenuated in the right and left ventricles\r\nthan is seen in Nature. Inside these illuminated holes, at a distance\r\nof about three inches, were ranged at this hour, as every passer knew,\r\nthe ruddy polls of Billy Wills the glazier, Smart the shoemaker,\r\nBuzzford the general dealer, and others of a secondary set of worthies,\r\nof a grade somewhat below that of the diners at the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms, each\r\nwith his yard of clay.\r\n\r\nA four-centred Tudor arch was over the entrance, and over the arch the\r\nsignboard, now visible in the rays of an opposite lamp. Hereon the\r\nMariners, who had been represented by the artist as persons of two\r\ndimensions only\xe2\x80\x94in other words, flat as a shadow\xe2\x80\x94were standing in a row\r\nin paralyzed attitudes. Being on the sunny side of the street the three\r\ncomrades had suffered largely from warping, splitting, fading, and\r\nshrinkage, so that they were but a half-invisible film upon the reality\r\nof the grain, and knots, and nails, which composed the signboard. As a\r\nmatter of fact, this state of things was not so much owing to Stannidge\r\nthe landlord\xe2\x80\x99s neglect, as from the lack of a painter in Casterbridge\r\nwho would undertake to reproduce the features of men so traditional.\r\n\r\nA long, narrow, dimly-lit passage gave access to the inn, within which\r\npassage the horses going to their stalls at the back, and the coming\r\nand departing human guests, rubbed shoulders indiscriminately, the\r\nlatter running no slight risk of having their toes trodden upon by the\r\nanimals. The good stabling and the good ale of the Mariners, though\r\nsomewhat difficult to reach on account of there being but this narrow\r\nway to both, were nevertheless perseveringly sought out by the\r\nsagacious old heads who knew what was what in Casterbridge.\r\n\r\nHenchard stood without the inn for a few instants; then lowering the\r\ndignity of his presence as much as possible by buttoning the brown\r\nholland coat over his shirt-front, and in other ways toning himself\r\ndown to his ordinary everyday appearance, he entered the inn door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane and her mother had arrived some twenty minutes earlier.\r\nOutside the house they had stood and considered whether even this\r\nhomely place, though recommended as moderate, might not be too serious\r\nin its prices for their light pockets. Finally, however, they had found\r\ncourage to enter, and duly met Stannidge the landlord, a silent man,\r\nwho drew and carried frothing measures to this room and to that,\r\nshoulder to shoulder with his waiting-maids\xe2\x80\x94a stately slowness,\r\nhowever, entering into his ministrations by contrast with theirs, as\r\nbecame one whose service was somewhat optional. It would have been\r\naltogether optional but for the orders of the landlady, a person who\r\nsat in the bar, corporeally motionless, but with a flitting eye and\r\nquick ear, with which she observed and heard through the open door and\r\nhatchway the pressing needs of customers whom her husband overlooked\r\nthough close at hand. Elizabeth and her mother were passively accepted\r\nas sojourners, and shown to a small bedroom under one of the gables,\r\nwhere they sat down.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the inn seemed to be to compensate for the antique\r\nawkwardness, crookedness, and obscurity of the passages, floors, and\r\nwindows, by quantities of clean linen spread about everywhere, and this\r\nhad a dazzling effect upon the travellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis too good for us\xe2\x80\x94we can\xe2\x80\x99t meet it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder woman, looking\r\nround the apartment with misgiving as soon as they were left alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it is, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must be respectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must pay our way even before we must be respectable,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her\r\nmother. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henchard is too high for us to make ourselves known to\r\nhim, I much fear; so we\xe2\x80\x99ve only our own pockets to depend on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane after an interval of\r\nwaiting, during which their needs seemed quite forgotten under the\r\npress of business below. And leaving the room, she descended the stairs\r\nand penetrated to the bar.\r\n\r\nIf there was one good thing more than another which characterized this\r\nsingle-hearted girl it was a willingness to sacrifice her personal\r\ncomfort and dignity to the common weal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you seem busy here to-night, and mother\xe2\x80\x99s not well off, might I\r\ntake out part of our accommodation by helping?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked of the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\nThe latter, who remained as fixed in the arm-chair as if she had been\r\nmelted into it when in a liquid state, and could not now be unstuck,\r\nlooked the girl up and down inquiringly, with her hands on the\r\nchair-arms. Such arrangements as the one Elizabeth proposed were not\r\nuncommon in country villages; but, though Casterbridge was\r\nold-fashioned, the custom was well-nigh obsolete here. The mistress of\r\nthe house, however, was an easy woman to strangers, and she made no\r\nobjection. Thereupon Elizabeth, being instructed by nods and motions\r\nfrom the taciturn landlord as to where she could find the different\r\nthings, trotted up and down stairs with materials for her own and her\r\nparent\xe2\x80\x99s meal.\r\n\r\nWhile she was doing this the wood partition in the centre of the house\r\nthrilled to its centre with the tugging of a bell-pull upstairs. A bell\r\nbelow tinkled a note that was feebler in sound than the twanging of\r\nwires and cranks that had produced it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the Scotch gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady omnisciently; and\r\nturning her eyes to Elizabeth, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, can you go and see if his\r\nsupper is on the tray? If it is you can take it up to him. The front\r\nroom over this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane, though hungry, willingly postponed serving herself\r\nawhile, and applied to the cook in the kitchen whence she brought forth\r\nthe tray of supper viands, and proceeded with it upstairs to the\r\napartment indicated. The accommodation of the Three Mariners was far\r\nfrom spacious, despite the fair area of ground it covered. The room\r\ndemanded by intrusive beams and rafters, partitions, passages,\r\nstaircases, disused ovens, settles, and four-posters, left\r\ncomparatively small quarters for human beings. Moreover, this being at\r\na time before home-brewing was abandoned by the smaller victuallers,\r\nand a house in which the twelve-bushel strength was still religiously\r\nadhered to by the landlord in his ale, the quality of the liquor was\r\nthe chief attraction of the premises, so that everything had to make\r\nway for utensils and operations in connection therewith. Thus Elizabeth\r\nfound that the Scotchman was located in a room quite close to the small\r\none that had been allotted to herself and her mother.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered nobody was present but the young man himself\xe2\x80\x94the same\r\nwhom she had seen lingering without the windows of the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms\r\nHotel. He was now idly reading a copy of the local paper, and was\r\nhardly conscious of her entry, so that she looked at him quite coolly,\r\nand saw how his forehead shone where the light caught it, and how\r\nnicely his hair was cut, and the sort of velvet-pile or down that was\r\non the skin at the back of his neck, and how his cheek was so truly\r\ncurved as to be part of a globe, and how clearly drawn were the lids\r\nand lashes which hid his bent eyes.\r\n\r\nShe set down the tray, spread his supper, and went away without a word.\r\nOn her arrival below the landlady, who was as kind as she was fat and\r\nlazy, saw that Elizabeth-Jane was rather tired, though in her\r\nearnestness to be useful she was waiving her own needs altogether. Mrs.\r\nStannidge thereupon said with a considerate peremptoriness that she and\r\nher mother had better take their own suppers if they meant to have any.\r\n\r\nElizabeth fetched their simple provisions, as she had fetched the\r\nScotchman\xe2\x80\x99s, and went up to the little chamber where she had left her\r\nmother, noiselessly pushing open the door with the edge of the tray. To\r\nher surprise her mother, instead of being reclined on the bed where she\r\nhad left her was in an erect position, with lips parted. At Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentry she lifted her finger.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this was soon apparent. The room allotted to the two\r\nwomen had at one time served as a dressing-room to the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber, as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94now screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper. But, as is\r\nfrequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the\r\nThree Mariners, every word spoken in either of these rooms was\r\ndistinctly audible in the other. Such sounds came through now.\r\n\r\nThus silently conjured Elizabeth deposited the tray, and her mother\r\nwhispered as she drew near, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mayor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tremors in Susan Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s tone might have led any person but one\r\nso perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was, to surmise some\r\ncloser connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of\r\naccounting for them.\r\n\r\nTwo men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber, the young\r\nScotchman and Henchard, who, having entered the inn while\r\nElizabeth-Jane was in the kitchen waiting for the supper, had been\r\ndeferentially conducted upstairs by host Stannidge himself. The girl\r\nnoiselessly laid out their little meal, and beckoned to her mother to\r\njoin her, which Mrs. Henchard mechanically did, her attention being\r\nfixed on the conversation through the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely strolled in on my way home to ask you a question about\r\nsomething that has excited my curiosity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mayor, with careless\r\ngeniality. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I see you have not finished supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but I will be done in a little! Ye needn\xe2\x80\x99t go, sir. Take a seat.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve almost done, and it makes no difference at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard seemed to take the seat offered, and in a moment he resumed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, first I should ask, did you write this?\xe2\x80\x9d A rustling of paper\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotchman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cI am under the impression that we have met by\r\naccident while waiting for the morning to keep an appointment with each\r\nother? My name is Henchard, ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you replied to an advertisement for\r\na corn-factor\xe2\x80\x99s manager that I put into the paper\xe2\x80\x94ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you come here\r\nto see me about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotchman, with some surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you are the man,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Henchard insistingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwho arranged\r\nto come and see me? Joshua, Joshua, Jipp\xe2\x80\x94Jopp\xe2\x80\x94what was his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Donald Farfrae. It is\r\ntrue I am in the corren trade\xe2\x80\x94but I have replied to no advertisement,\r\nand arranged to see no one. I am on my way to Bristol\xe2\x80\x94from there to the\r\nother side of the warrld, to try my fortune in the great wheat-growing\r\ndistricts of the West! I have some inventions useful to the trade, and\r\nthere is no scope for developing them heere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo America\xe2\x80\x94well, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, in a tone of disappointment, so\r\nstrong as to make itself felt like a damp atmosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I could\r\nhave sworn you were the man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman murmured another negative, and there was a silence, till\r\nHenchard resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cThen I am truly and sincerely obliged to you for the\r\nfew words you wrote on that paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nothing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it has a great importance for me just now. This row about my\r\ngrown wheat, which I declare to Heaven I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know to be bad till the\r\npeople came complaining, has put me to my wits\xe2\x80\x99 end. I\xe2\x80\x99ve some hundreds\r\nof quarters of it on hand; and if your renovating process will make it\r\nwholesome, why, you can see what a quag \xe2\x80\x99twould get me out of. I saw in\r\na moment there might be truth in it. But I should like to have it\r\nproved; and of course you don\xe2\x80\x99t care to tell the steps of the process\r\nsufficiently for me to do that, without my paying ye well for\xe2\x80\x99t first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man reflected a moment or two. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I have any\r\nobjection,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to another country, and curing bad corn\r\nis not the line I\xe2\x80\x99ll take up there. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye the whole of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll make more out of it heere than I will in a foreign country.\r\nJust look heere a minute, sir. I can show ye by a sample in my\r\ncarpet-bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe click of a lock followed, and there was a sifting and rustling;\r\nthen a discussion about so many ounces to the bushel, and drying, and\r\nrefrigerating, and so on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese few grains will be sufficient to show ye with,\xe2\x80\x9d came in the\r\nyoung fellow\xe2\x80\x99s voice; and after a pause, during which some operation\r\nseemed to be intently watched by them both, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, now,\r\ndo you taste that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s complete!\xe2\x80\x94quite restored, or\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94nearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite enough restored to make good seconds out of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nScotchman. \xe2\x80\x9cTo fetch it back entirely is impossible; Nature won\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nso much as that, but heere you go a great way towards it. Well, sir,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the process, I don\xe2\x80\x99t value it, for it can be but of little use\r\nin countries where the weather is more settled than in ours; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe only too glad if it\xe2\x80\x99s of service to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut hearken to me,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cMy business you know, is in\r\ncorn and in hay, but I was brought up as a hay-trusser simply, and hay\r\nis what I understand best though I now do more in corn than in the\r\nother. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll accept the place, you shall manage the corn branch\r\nentirely, and receive a commission in addition to salary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re liberal\xe2\x80\x94very liberal, but no, no\xe2\x80\x94I cannet!\xe2\x80\x9d the young man still\r\nreplied, with some distress in his accents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard conclusively. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94to change the subject\xe2\x80\x94one\r\ngood turn deserves another; don\xe2\x80\x99t stay to finish that miserable supper.\r\nCome to my house, I can find something better for \xe2\x80\x99ee than cold ham and\r\nale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonald Farfrae was grateful\xe2\x80\x94said he feared he must decline\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nwished to leave early next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cplease yourself. But I tell you,\r\nyoung man, if this holds good for the bulk, as it has done for the\r\nsample, you have saved my credit, stranger though you be. What shall I\r\npay you for this knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all, nothing at all. It may not prove necessary to ye to\r\nuse it often, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t value it at all. I thought I might just as\r\nwell let ye know, as you were in a difficulty, and they were harrd upon\r\nye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t soon forget this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd from a\r\nstranger!... I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe you were not the man I had engaged!\r\nSays I to myself, \xe2\x80\x98He knows who I am, and recommends himself by this\r\nstroke.\xe2\x80\x99 And yet it turns out, after all, that you are not the man who\r\nanswered my advertisement, but a stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay; that\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\nHenchard again suspended his words, and then his voice came\r\nthoughtfully: \xe2\x80\x9cYour forehead, Farfrae, is something like my poor\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94now dead and gone; and the nose, too, isn\xe2\x80\x99t unlike his. You\r\nmust be, what\xe2\x80\x94five foot nine, I reckon? I am six foot one and a half\r\nout of my shoes. But what of that? In my business, \xe2\x80\x99tis true that\r\nstrength and bustle build up a firm. But judgment and knowledge are\r\nwhat keep it established. Unluckily, I am bad at science, Farfrae; bad\r\nat figures\xe2\x80\x94a rule o\xe2\x80\x99 thumb sort of man. You are just the reverse\xe2\x80\x94I can\r\nsee that. I have been looking for such as you these two year, and yet\r\nyou are not for me. Well, before I go, let me ask this: Though you are\r\nnot the young man I thought you were, what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference? Can\xe2\x80\x99t ye\r\nstay just the same? Have you really made up your mind about this\r\nAmerican notion? I won\xe2\x80\x99t mince matters. I feel you would be invaluable\r\nto me\xe2\x80\x94that needn\xe2\x80\x99t be said\xe2\x80\x94and if you will bide and be my manager, I\r\nwill make it worth your while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy plans are fixed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, in negative tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nformed a scheme, and so we need na say any more about it. But will you\r\nnot drink with me, sir? I find this Casterbridge ale warreming to the\r\nstomach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I fain would, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard gravely, the\r\nscraping of his chair informing the listeners that he was rising to\r\nleave. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too\r\nstrong\xe2\x80\x94far too strong\xe2\x80\x94and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on\r\naccount of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such\r\nan impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\xe2\x80\x99d drink\r\nnothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I\r\nhave kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the\r\ndog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll no\xe2\x80\x99 press ye, sir\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll no\xe2\x80\x99 press ye. I respect your vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, with\r\nstrong feeling in his tones. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it will be long before I see one that\r\nwould suit me so well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man appeared much moved by Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s warm convictions of his\r\nvalue. He was silent till they reached the door. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could\r\nstay\xe2\x80\x94sincerely I would like to,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no\xe2\x80\x94it cannet be! it\r\ncannet! I want to see the warrld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThus they parted; and Elizabeth-Jane and her mother remained each in\r\nher thoughts over their meal, the mother\xe2\x80\x99s face being strangely bright\r\nsince Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s avowal of shame for a past action. The quivering of\r\nthe partition to its core presently denoted that Donald Farfrae had\r\nagain rung his bell, no doubt to have his supper removed; for humming a\r\ntune, and walking up and down, he seemed to be attracted by the lively\r\nbursts of conversation and melody from the general company below. He\r\nsauntered out upon the landing, and descended the staircase.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth-Jane had carried down his supper tray, and also that\r\nused by her mother and herself, she found the bustle of serving to be\r\nat its height below, as it always was at this hour. The young woman\r\nshrank from having anything to do with the ground-floor serving, and\r\ncrept silently about observing the scene\xe2\x80\x94so new to her, fresh from the\r\nseclusion of a seaside cottage. In the general sitting-room, which was\r\nlarge, she remarked the two or three dozen strong-backed chairs that\r\nstood round against the wall, each fitted with its genial occupant; the\r\nsanded floor; the black settle which, projecting endwise from the wall\r\nwithin the door, permitted Elizabeth to be a spectator of all that went\r\non without herself being particularly seen.\r\n\r\nThe young Scotchman had just joined the guests. These, in addition to\r\nthe respectable master-tradesmen occupying the seats of privileges in\r\nthe bow-window and its neighbourhood, included an inferior set at the\r\nunlighted end, whose seats were mere benches against the wall, and who\r\ndrank from cups instead of from glasses. Among the latter she noticed\r\nsome of those personages who had stood outside the windows of the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s Arms.\r\n\r\nBehind their backs was a small window, with a wheel ventilator in one\r\nof the panes, which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling\r\nsound, as suddenly stop, and as suddenly start again.\r\n\r\nWhile thus furtively making her survey the opening words of a song\r\ngreeted her ears from the front of the settle, in a melody and accent\r\nof peculiar charm. There had been some singing before she came down;\r\nand now the Scotchman had made himself so soon at home that, at the\r\nrequest of some of the master-tradesmen, he, too, was favouring the\r\nroom with a ditty.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane was fond of music; she could not help pausing to listen;\r\nand the longer she listened the more she was enraptured. She had never\r\nheard any singing like this and it was evident that the majority of the\r\naudience had not heard such frequently, for they were attentive to a\r\nmuch greater degree than usual. They neither whispered, nor drank, nor\r\ndipped their pipe-stems in their ale to moisten them, nor pushed the\r\nmug to their neighbours. The singer himself grew emotional, till she\r\ncould imagine a tear in his eye as the words went on:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hame, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hame, hame fain would I be,\r\nO hame, hame, hame to my ain countree!\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an eye that ever weeps, and a fair face will be fain,\r\nAs I pass through Annan Water with my bonnie bands again;\r\nWhen the flower is in the bud, and the leaf upon the tree,\r\nThe lark shall sing me hame to my ain countree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a burst of applause, and a deep silence which was even more\r\neloquent than the applause. It was of such a kind that the snapping of\r\na pipe-stem too long for him by old Solomon Longways, who was one of\r\nthose gathered at the shady end of the room, seemed a harsh and\r\nirreverent act. Then the ventilator in the window-pane spasmodically\r\nstarted off for a new spin, and the pathos of Donald\xe2\x80\x99s song was\r\ntemporarily effaced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas not amiss\xe2\x80\x94not at all amiss!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Christopher Coney, who was\r\nalso present. And removing his pipe a finger\xe2\x80\x99s breadth from his lips,\r\nhe said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cDraw on with the next verse, young gentleman, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have it again, stranger,\xe2\x80\x9d said the glazier, a stout,\r\nbucket-headed man, with a white apron rolled up round his waist. \xe2\x80\x9cFolks\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t lift up their hearts like that in this part of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nturning aside, he said in undertones, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is the young man?\xe2\x80\x94Scotch,\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99ye say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, straight from the mountains of Scotland, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nConey.\r\n\r\nYoung Farfrae repeated the last verse. It was plain that nothing so\r\npathetic had been heard at the Three Mariners for a considerable time.\r\nThe difference of accent, the excitability of the singer, the intense\r\nlocal feeling, and the seriousness with which he worked himself up to a\r\nclimax, surprised this set of worthies, who were only too prone to shut\r\nup their emotions with caustic words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanged if our country down here is worth singing about like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the glazier, as the Scotchman again melodized with a dying\r\nfall, \xe2\x80\x9cMy ain countree!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you take away from among us the fools\r\nand the rogues, and the lammigers, and the wanton hussies, and the\r\nslatterns, and such like, there\xe2\x80\x99s cust few left to ornament a song with\r\nin Casterbridge, or the country round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buzzford, the dealer, looking at the grain of the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCasterbridge is a old, hoary place o\xe2\x80\x99 wickedness, by all account. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nrecorded in history that we rebelled against the King one or two\r\nhundred years ago, in the time of the Romans, and that lots of us was\r\nhanged on Gallows Hill, and quartered, and our different jints sent\r\nabout the country like butcher\xe2\x80\x99s meat; and for my part I can well\r\nbelieve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did ye come away from yer own country for, young maister, if ye\r\nbe so wownded about it?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Christopher Coney, from the\r\nbackground, with the tone of a man who preferred the original subject.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth your while on our account, for as Maister Billy\r\nWills says, we be bruckle folk here\xe2\x80\x94the best o\xe2\x80\x99 us hardly honest\r\nsometimes, what with hard winters, and so many mouths to fill, and\r\nGoda\xe2\x80\x99mighty sending his little taties so terrible small to fill \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwith. We don\xe2\x80\x99t think about flowers and fair faces, not we\xe2\x80\x94except in the\r\nshape o\xe2\x80\x99 cauliflowers and pigs\xe2\x80\x99 chaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald Farfrae, gazing round into their faces with\r\nearnest concern; \xe2\x80\x9cthe best of ye hardly honest\xe2\x80\x94not that surely? None of\r\nye has been stealing what didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord! no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon Longways, smiling grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s only his\r\nrandom way o\xe2\x80\x99 speaking. \xe2\x80\x99A was always such a man of underthoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(And reprovingly towards Christopher): \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye be so over-familiar\r\nwith a gentleman that ye know nothing of\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s travelled a\xe2\x80\x99most\r\nfrom the North Pole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChristopher Coney was silenced, and as he could get no public sympathy,\r\nhe mumbled his feelings to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cBe dazed, if I loved my country\r\nhalf as well as the young feller do, I\xe2\x80\x99d live by claning my neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npigsties afore I\xe2\x80\x99d go away! For my part I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more love for my\r\ncountry than I have for Botany Bay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Longways; \xe2\x80\x9clet the young man draw onward with his ballet,\r\nor we shall be here all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the singer apologetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoul of my body, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have another!\xe2\x80\x9d said the general dealer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you turn a strain to the ladies, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired a fat woman with a\r\nfigured purple apron, the waiststring of which was overhung so far by\r\nher sides as to be invisible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him breathe\xe2\x80\x94let him breathe, Mother Cuxsom. He hain\xe2\x80\x99t got his\r\nsecond wind yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master glazier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, but I have!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young man; and he at once rendered\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Nannie\xe2\x80\x9d with faultless modulations, and another or two of the like\r\nsentiment, winding up at their earnest request with \xe2\x80\x9cAuld Lang Syne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time he had completely taken possession of the hearts of the\r\nThree Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 inmates, including even old Coney. Notwithstanding an\r\noccasional odd gravity which awoke their sense of the ludicrous for the\r\nmoment, they began to view him through a golden haze which the tone of\r\nhis mind seemed to raise around him. Casterbridge had\r\nsentiment\xe2\x80\x94Casterbridge had romance; but this stranger\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment was\r\nof differing quality. Or rather, perhaps, the difference was mainly\r\nsuperficial; he was to them like the poet of a new school who takes his\r\ncontemporaries by storm; who is not really new, but is the first to\r\narticulate what all his listeners have felt, though but dumbly till\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nThe silent landlord came and leant over the settle while the young man\r\nsang; and even Mrs. Stannidge managed to unstick herself from the\r\nframework of her chair in the bar and get as far as the door-post,\r\nwhich movement she accomplished by rolling herself round, as a cask is\r\ntrundled on the chine by a drayman without losing much of its\r\nperpendicular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you going to bide in Casterbridge, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotchman, with melancholy fatality in his voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only passing thirrough! I am on my way to Bristol, and on frae\r\nthere to foreign parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be truly sorry to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon Longways. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can ill\r\nafford to lose tuneful wynd-pipes like yours when they fall among us.\r\nAnd verily, to mak\xe2\x80\x99 acquaintance with a man a-come from so far, from\r\nthe land o\xe2\x80\x99 perpetual snow, as we may say, where wolves and wild boars\r\nand other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds\r\nhere-about\xe2\x80\x94why, \xe2\x80\x99tis a thing we can\xe2\x80\x99t do every day; and there\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nsound information for bide-at-homes like we when such a man opens his\r\nmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but ye mistake my country,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, looking round\r\nupon them with tragic fixity, till his eye lighted up and his cheek\r\nkindled with a sudden enthusiasm to right their errors. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are not\r\nperpetual snow and wolves at all in it!\xe2\x80\x94except snow in winter,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94a little in summer just sometimes, and a \xe2\x80\x98gaberlunzie\xe2\x80\x99 or two\r\nstalking about here and there, if ye may call them dangerous. Eh, but\r\nyou should take a summer jarreny to Edinboro\xe2\x80\x99, and Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s Seat, and\r\nall round there, and then go on to the lochs, and all the Highland\r\nscenery\xe2\x80\x94in May and June\xe2\x80\x94and you would never say \xe2\x80\x99tis the land of wolves\r\nand perpetual snow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94it stands to reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said Buzzford. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis barren\r\nignorance that leads to such words. He\xe2\x80\x99s a simple home-spun man, that\r\nnever was fit for good company\xe2\x80\x94think nothing of him, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do ye carry your flock bed, and your quilt, and your crock, and\r\nyour bit of chiney? or do ye go in bare bones, as I may say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nChristopher Coney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve sent on my luggage\xe2\x80\x94though it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much; for the voyage is long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDonald\xe2\x80\x99s eyes dropped into a remote gaze as he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I said to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x98Never a one of the prizes of life will I come by unless I\r\nundertake it!\xe2\x80\x99 and I decided to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA general sense of regret, in which Elizabeth-Jane shared not least,\r\nmade itself apparent in the company. As she looked at Farfrae from the\r\nback of the settle she decided that his statements showed him to be no\r\nless thoughtful than his fascinating melodies revealed him to be\r\ncordial and impassioned. She admired the serious light in which he\r\nlooked at serious things. He had seen no jest in ambiguities and\r\nroguery, as the Casterbridge toss-pots had done; and rightly not\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwas none. She disliked those wretched humours of Christopher Coney and\r\nhis tribe; and he did not appreciate them. He seemed to feel exactly as\r\nshe felt about life and its surroundings\xe2\x80\x94that they were a tragical\r\nrather than a comical thing; that though one could be gay on occasion,\r\nmoments of gaiety were interludes, and no part of the actual drama. It\r\nwas extraordinary how similar their views were.\r\n\r\nThough it was still early the young Scotchman expressed his wish to\r\nretire, whereupon the landlady whispered to Elizabeth to run upstairs\r\nand turn down his bed. She took a candlestick and proceeded on her\r\nmission, which was the act of a few moments only. When, candle in hand,\r\nshe reached the top of the stairs on her way down again, Mr. Farfrae\r\nwas at the foot coming up. She could not very well retreat; they met\r\nand passed in the turn of the staircase.\r\n\r\nShe must have appeared interesting in some way\xe2\x80\x94not-withstanding her\r\nplain dress\xe2\x80\x94or rather, possibly, in consequence of it, for she was a\r\ngirl characterized by earnestness and soberness of mien, with which\r\nsimple drapery accorded well. Her face flushed, too, at the slight\r\nawkwardness of the meeting, and she passed him with her eyes bent on\r\nthe candle-flame that she carried just below her nose. Thus it happened\r\nthat when confronting her he smiled; and then, with the manner of a\r\ntemporarily light-hearted man, who has started himself on a flight of\r\nsong whose momentum he cannot readily check, he softly tuned an old\r\nditty that she seemed to suggest\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I came in by my bower door,\r\n    As day was waxin\xe2\x80\x99 wearie,\r\nOh wha came tripping down the stair\r\n    But bonnie Peg my dearie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane, rather disconcerted, hastened on; and the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice died away, humming more of the same within the closed door of his\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHere the scene and sentiment ended for the present. When soon after,\r\nthe girl rejoined her mother, the latter was still in thought\xe2\x80\x94on quite\r\nanother matter than a young man\xe2\x80\x99s song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered (that the Scotchman might not\r\noverhear). \xe2\x80\x9cOn no account ought ye to have helped serve here to-night.\r\nNot because of ourselves, but for the sake of _him_. If he should\r\nbefriend us, and take us up, and then find out what you did when\r\nstaying here, \xe2\x80\x99twould grieve and wound his natural pride as Mayor of\r\nthe town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth, who would perhaps have been more alarmed at this than her\r\nmother had she known the real relationship, was not much disturbed\r\nabout it as things stood. Her \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x9d was another man than her poor\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cFor myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t at all mind waiting a\r\nlittle upon him. He\xe2\x80\x99s so respectable, and educated\xe2\x80\x94far above the rest\r\nof \xe2\x80\x99em in the inn. They thought him very simple not to know their grim\r\nbroad way of talking about themselves here. But of course he didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94he was too refined in his mind to know such things!\xe2\x80\x9d Thus she\r\nearnestly pleaded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x9d of her mother was not so far away as even they\r\nthought. After leaving the Three Mariners he had sauntered up and down\r\nthe empty High Street, passing and repassing the inn in his promenade.\r\nWhen the Scotchman sang his voice had reached Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s ears through\r\nthe heart-shaped holes in the window-shutters, and had led him to pause\r\noutside them a long while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, to be sure, how that fellow does draw me!\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose \xe2\x80\x99tis because I\xe2\x80\x99m so lonely. I\xe2\x80\x99d have given him a\r\nthird share in the business to have stayed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth-Jane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow\r\nair brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if\r\nshe had been in the remotest hamlet. Casterbridge was the complement of\r\nthe rural life around, not its urban opposite. Bees and butterflies in\r\nthe cornfields at the top of the town, who desired to get to the meads\r\nat the bottom, took no circuitous course, but flew straight down High\r\nStreet without any apparent consciousness that they were traversing\r\nstrange latitudes. And in autumn airy spheres of thistledown floated\r\ninto the same street, lodged upon the shop fronts, blew into drains,\r\nand innumerable tawny and yellow leaves skimmed along the pavement, and\r\nstole through people\xe2\x80\x99s doorways into their passages with a hesitating\r\nscratch on the floor, like the skirts of timid visitors.\r\n\r\nHearing voices, one of which was close at hand, she withdrew her head\r\nand glanced from behind the window-curtains. Mr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x94now habited\r\nno longer as a great personage, but as a thriving man of business\xe2\x80\x94was\r\npausing on his way up the middle of the street, and the Scotchman was\r\nlooking from the window adjoining her own. Henchard it appeared, had\r\ngone a little way past the inn before he had noticed his acquaintance\r\nof the previous evening. He came back a few steps, Donald Farfrae\r\nopening the window further.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are off soon, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard upwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94almost this moment, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk on till\r\nthe coach makes up on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe way ye are going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen shall we walk together to the top o\xe2\x80\x99 town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotchman.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the latter emerged, bag in hand. Henchard looked at\r\nthe bag as at an enemy. It showed there was no mistake about the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s departure. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my lad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have been a wise\r\nman, and have stayed with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94it might have been wiser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald, looking\r\nmicroscopically at the houses that were furthest off. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only\r\ntelling ye the truth when I say my plans are vague.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had by this time passed on from the precincts of the inn, and\r\nElizabeth-Jane heard no more. She saw that they continued in\r\nconversation, Henchard turning to the other occasionally, and\r\nemphasizing some remark with a gesture. Thus they passed the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArms Hotel, the Market House, St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s churchyard wall, ascending to\r\nthe upper end of the long street till they were small as two grains of\r\ncorn; when they bent suddenly to the right into the Bristol Road, and\r\nwere out of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a good man\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI was nothing\r\nto him, and there was no reason why he should have wished me good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe simple thought, with its latent sense of slight, had moulded itself\r\nout of the following little fact: when the Scotchman came out at the\r\ndoor he had by accident glanced up at her; and then he had looked away\r\nagain without nodding, or smiling, or saying a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still thinking, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she turned inwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am thinking of Mr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s sudden liking for that young man.\r\nHe was always so. Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are\r\nnot related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they debated this question a procession of five large waggons\r\nwent past, laden with hay up to the bedroom windows. They came in from\r\nthe country, and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a\r\ngreat part of the night. To the shaft of each hung a little board, on\r\nwhich was painted in white letters, \xe2\x80\x9cHenchard, corn-factor and\r\nhay-merchant.\xe2\x80\x9d The spectacle renewed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that, for\r\nher daughter\xe2\x80\x99s sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was continued during breakfast, and the end of it was\r\nthat Mrs. Henchard decided, for good or for ill, to send Elizabeth-Jane\r\nwith a message to Henchard, to the effect that his relative Susan, a\r\nsailor\xe2\x80\x99s widow, was in the town; leaving it to him to say whether or\r\nnot he would recognize her. What had brought her to this determination\r\nwere chiefly two things. He had been described as a lonely widower; and\r\nhe had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life. There was\r\npromise in both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he says no,\xe2\x80\x9d she enjoined, as Elizabeth-Jane stood, bonnet on,\r\nready to depart; \xe2\x80\x9cif he thinks it does not become the good position he\r\nhas reached to in the town, to own\xe2\x80\x94to let us call on him as\xe2\x80\x94his distant\r\nkinfolk, say, \xe2\x80\x98Then, sir, we would rather not intrude; we will leave\r\nCasterbridge as quietly as we have come, and go back to our own\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x99 ...I almost feel that I would rather he did say so, as I have\r\nnot seen him for so many years, and we are so\xe2\x80\x94little allied to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he say yes?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the more sanguine one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Henchard cautiously, \xe2\x80\x9cask him to write me\r\na note, saying when and how he will see us\xe2\x80\x94or _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane went a few steps towards the landing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I fully know I have no claim upon him\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nI am glad to find he is thriving; that I hope his life may be long and\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94there, go.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus with a half-hearted willingness, a smothered\r\nreluctance, did the poor forgiving woman start her unconscious daughter\r\non this errand.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and market-day, when Elizabeth paced up the\r\nHigh Street, in no great hurry; for to herself her position was only\r\nthat of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one. The front doors\r\nof the private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time,\r\nno thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid\r\nburgesses. Hence, through the long, straight, entrance passages thus\r\nunclosed could be seen, as through tunnels, the mossy gardens at the\r\nback, glowing with nasturtiums, fuchsias, scarlet geraniums, \xe2\x80\x9cbloody\r\nwarriors,\xe2\x80\x9d snapdragons, and dahlias, this floral blaze being backed by\r\ncrusted grey stone-work remaining from a yet remoter Casterbridge than\r\nthe venerable one visible in the street. The old-fashioned fronts of\r\nthese houses, which had older than old-fashioned backs, rose sheer from\r\nthe pavement, into which the bow windows protruded like bastions,\r\nnecessitating a pleasing _chassez-d\xc3\xa9chassez_ movement to the\r\ntime-pressed pedestrian at every few yards. He was bound also to evolve\r\nother Terpsichorean figures in respect of door-steps, scrapers,\r\ncellar-hatches, church buttresses, and the overhanging angles of walls\r\nwhich, originally unobtrusive, had become bow-legged and knock-kneed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these fixed obstacles which spoke so cheerfully of\r\nindividual unrestraint as to boundaries, movables occupied the path and\r\nroadway to a perplexing extent. First the vans of the carriers in and\r\nout of Casterbridge, who hailed from Mellstock, Weatherbury, The\r\nHintocks, Sherton-Abbas, Kingsbere, Overcombe, and many other towns and\r\nvillages round. Their owners were numerous enough to be regarded as a\r\ntribe, and had almost distinctiveness enough to be regarded as a race.\r\nTheir vans had just arrived, and were drawn up on each side of the\r\nstreet in close file, so as to form at places a wall between the\r\npavement and the roadway. Moreover every shop pitched out half its\r\ncontents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb, extending the display\r\neach week a little further and further into the roadway, despite the\r\nexpostulations of the two feeble old constables, until there remained\r\nbut a tortuous defile for carriages down the centre of the street,\r\nwhich afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins. Over the\r\npavement on the sunny side of the way hung shopblinds so constructed as\r\nto give the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s hat a smart buffet off his head, as from the\r\nunseen hands of Cranstoun\xe2\x80\x99s Goblin Page, celebrated in romantic lore.\r\n\r\nHorses for sale were tied in rows, their forelegs on the pavement,\r\ntheir hind legs in the street, in which position they occasionally\r\nnipped little boys by the shoulder who were passing to school. And any\r\ninviting recess in front of a house that had been modestly kept back\r\nfrom the general line was utilized by pig-dealers as a pen for their\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe yeomen, farmers, dairymen, and townsfolk, who came to transact\r\nbusiness in these ancient streets, spoke in other ways than by\r\narticulation. Not to hear the words of your interlocutor in\r\nmetropolitan centres is to know nothing of his meaning. Here the face,\r\nthe arms, the hat, the stick, the body throughout spoke equally with\r\nthe tongue. To express satisfaction the Casterbridge market-man added\r\nto his utterance a broadening of the cheeks, a crevicing of the eyes, a\r\nthrowing back of the shoulders, which was intelligible from the other\r\nend of the street. If he wondered, though all Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s carts and\r\nwaggons were rattling past him, you knew it from perceiving the inside\r\nof his crimson mouth, and a target-like circling of his eyes.\r\nDeliberation caused sundry attacks on the moss of adjoining walls with\r\nthe end of his stick, a change of his hat from the horizontal to the\r\nless so; a sense of tediousness announced itself in a lowering of the\r\nperson by spreading the knees to a lozenge-shaped aperture and\r\ncontorting the arms. Chicanery, subterfuge, had hardly a place in the\r\nstreets of this honest borough to all appearance; and it was said that\r\nthe lawyers in the Court House hard by occasionally threw in strong\r\narguments for the other side out of pure generosity (though apparently\r\nby mischance) when advancing their own.\r\n\r\nThus Casterbridge was in most respects but the pole, focus, or\r\nnerve-knot of the surrounding country life; differing from the many\r\nmanufacturing towns which are as foreign bodies set down, like boulders\r\non a plain, in a green world with which they have nothing in common.\r\nCasterbridge lived by agriculture at one remove further from the\r\nfountainhead than the adjoining villages\xe2\x80\x94no more. The townsfolk\r\nunderstood every fluctuation in the rustic\xe2\x80\x99s condition, for it affected\r\ntheir receipts as much as the labourer\xe2\x80\x99s; they entered into the\r\ntroubles and joys which moved the aristocratic families ten miles\r\nround\xe2\x80\x94for the same reason. And even at the dinner-parties of the\r\nprofessional families the subjects of discussion were corn,\r\ncattle-disease, sowing and reaping, fencing and planting; while\r\npolitics were viewed by them less from their own standpoint of\r\nburgesses with rights and privileges than from the standpoint of their\r\ncountry neighbours.\r\n\r\nAll the venerable contrivances and confusions which delighted the eye\r\nby their quaintness, and in a measure reasonableness, in this rare old\r\nmarket-town, were metropolitan novelties to the unpractised eyes of\r\nElizabeth-Jane, fresh from netting fish-seines in a seaside cottage.\r\nVery little inquiry was necessary to guide her footsteps. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse was one of the best, faced with dull red-and-grey old brick. The\r\nfront door was open, and, as in other houses, she could see through the\r\npassage to the end of the garden\xe2\x80\x94nearly a quarter of a mile off.\r\n\r\nMr. Henchard was not in the house, but in the store-yard. She was\r\nconducted into the mossy garden, and through a door in the wall, which\r\nwas studded with rusty nails speaking of generations of fruit-trees\r\nthat had been trained there. The door opened upon the yard, and here\r\nshe was left to find him as she could. It was a place flanked by\r\nhay-barns, into which tons of fodder, all in trusses, were being packed\r\nfrom the waggons she had seen pass the inn that morning. On other sides\r\nof the yard were wooden granaries on stone staddles, to which access\r\nwas given by Flemish ladders, and a store-house several floors high.\r\nWherever the doors of these places were open, a closely packed throng\r\nof bursting wheat-sacks could be seen standing inside, with the air of\r\nawaiting a famine that would not come.\r\n\r\nShe wandered about this place, uncomfortably conscious of the impending\r\ninterview, till she was quite weary of searching; she ventured to\r\ninquire of a boy in what quarter Mr. Henchard could be found. He\r\ndirected her to an office which she had not seen before, and knocking\r\nat the door she was answered by a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth turned the handle; and there stood before her, bending over\r\nsome sample-bags on a table, not the corn-merchant, but the young\r\nScotchman Mr. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x94in the act of pouring some grains of wheat from\r\none hand to the other. His hat hung on a peg behind him, and the roses\r\nof his carpet-bag glowed from the corner of the room.\r\n\r\nHaving toned her feelings and arranged words on her lips for Mr.\r\nHenchard, and for him alone, she was for the moment confounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotchman, like a man who permanently ruled\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nShe said she wanted to see Mr. Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; will you wait a minute? He\xe2\x80\x99s engaged just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung man, apparently not recognizing her as the girl at the inn. He\r\nhanded her a chair, bade her sit down and turned to his sample-bags\r\nagain. While Elizabeth-Jane sits waiting in great amaze at the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s presence we may briefly explain how he came there.\r\n\r\nWhen the two new acquaintances had passed out of sight that morning\r\ntowards the Bath and Bristol road they went on silently, except for a\r\nfew commonplaces, till they had gone down an avenue on the town walls\r\ncalled the Chalk Walk, leading to an angle where the North and West\r\nescarpments met. From this high corner of the square earthworks a vast\r\nextent of country could be seen. A footpath ran steeply down the green\r\nslope, conducting from the shady promenade on the walls to a road at\r\nthe bottom of the scarp. It was by this path the Scotchman had to\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s success to \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, holding out his right\r\nhand and leaning with his left upon the wicket which protected the\r\ndescent. In the act there was the inelegance of one whose feelings are\r\nnipped and wishes defeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall often think of this time, and of\r\nhow you came at the very moment to throw a light upon my difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill holding the young man\xe2\x80\x99s hand he paused, and then added\r\ndeliberately: \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am not the man to let a cause be lost for want of\r\na word. And before ye are gone for ever I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak. Once more, will ye\r\nstay? There it is, flat and plain. You can see that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t all\r\nselfishness that makes me press \xe2\x80\x99ee; for my business is not quite so\r\nscientific as to require an intellect entirely out of the common.\r\nOthers would do for the place without doubt. Some selfishness perhaps\r\nthere is, but there is more; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for me to repeat what. Come bide\r\nwith me\xe2\x80\x94and name your own terms. I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to \xe2\x80\x99em willingly and\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ithout a word of gainsaying; for, hang it, Farfrae, I like thee well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s hand remained steady in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s for a moment or two.\r\nHe looked over the fertile country that stretched beneath them, then\r\nbackward along the shaded walk reaching to the top of the town. His\r\nface flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never expected this\xe2\x80\x94I did not!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Providence! Should\r\nany one go against it? No; I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go to America; I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay and be\r\nyour man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis hand, which had lain lifeless in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s, returned the latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald Farfrae.\r\n\r\nThe face of Mr. Henchard beamed forth a satisfaction that was almost\r\nfierce in its strength. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you are my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nback to my house; let\xe2\x80\x99s clinch it at once by clear terms, so as to be\r\ncomfortable in our minds.\xe2\x80\x9d Farfrae caught up his bag and retraced the\r\nNorth-West Avenue in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s company as he had come. Henchard was\r\nall confidence now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the most distant fellow in the world when I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for a\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when a man takes my fancy he takes it strong. Now I\r\nam sure you can eat another breakfast? You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have eaten much so\r\nearly, even if they had anything at that place to gi\xe2\x80\x99e thee, which they\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t; so come to my house and we will have a solid, staunch tuck-in,\r\nand settle terms in black-and-white if you like; though my word\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbond. I can always make a good meal in the morning. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a splendid\r\ncold pigeon-pie going just now. You can have some home-brewed if you\r\nwant to, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too airly in the morning for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink it because of my oath,\r\nbut I am obliged to brew for my work-people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus talking they returned, and entered Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s premises by the back\r\nway or traffic entrance. Here the matter was settled over the\r\nbreakfast, at which Henchard heaped the young Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s plate to a\r\nprodigal fulness. He would not rest satisfied till Farfrae had written\r\nfor his luggage from Bristol, and dispatched the letter to the\r\npost-office. When it was done this man of strong impulses declared that\r\nhis new friend should take up his abode in his house\xe2\x80\x94at least till some\r\nsuitable lodgings could be found.\r\n\r\nHe then took Farfrae round and showed him the place, and the stores of\r\ngrain, and other stock; and finally entered the offices where the\r\nyounger of them has already been discovered by Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nWhile she still sat under the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes a man came up to the\r\ndoor, reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to\r\nadmit Elizabeth. The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple\r\nat Bethesda, and entered in her stead. She could hear his words to\r\nHenchard: \xe2\x80\x9cJoshua Jopp, sir\xe2\x80\x94by appointment\xe2\x80\x94the new manager.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe new manager!\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s in his office,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard bluntly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his office!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with a stultified air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mentioned Thursday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard; \xe2\x80\x9cand as you did not keep your\r\nappointment, I have engaged another manager. At first I thought he must\r\nbe you. Do you think I can wait when business is in question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said Thursday or Saturday, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the newcomer, pulling out a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corn-factor. \xe2\x80\x9cI can say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou as good as engaged me,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSubject to an interview,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for you\xe2\x80\x94very\r\nsorry indeed. But it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no more to be said, and the man came out, encountering\r\nElizabeth-Jane in his passage. She could see that his mouth twitched\r\nwith anger, and that bitter disappointment was written in his face\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane now entered, and stood before the master of the\r\npremises. His dark pupils\xe2\x80\x94which always seemed to have a red spark of\r\nlight in them, though this could hardly be a physical fact\xe2\x80\x94turned\r\nindifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her\r\nfigure. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, what is it, my young woman?\xe2\x80\x9d he said blandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I speak to you\xe2\x80\x94not on business, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at her more thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sent to tell you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she innocently went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a distant\r\nrelative of yours by marriage, Susan Newson, a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s widow, is in\r\nthe town, and to ask whether you would wish to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rich _rouge-et-noir_ of his countenance underwent a slight change.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94Susan is\xe2\x80\x94still alive?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you her daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir\xe2\x80\x94her only daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94do you call yourself\xe2\x80\x94your Christian name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth-Jane, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNewson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth-Jane Newson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis at once suggested to Henchard that the transaction of his early\r\nmarried life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history. It\r\nwas more than he could have expected. His wife had behaved kindly to\r\nhim in return for his unkindness, and had never proclaimed her wrong to\r\nher child or to the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am\xe2\x80\x94a good deal interested in your news,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as this is\r\nnot a matter of business, but pleasure, suppose we go indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with a gentle delicacy of manner, surprising to Elizabeth, that\r\nhe showed her out of the office and through the outer room, where\r\nDonald Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring\r\ninspection of a beginner in charge. Henchard preceded her through the\r\ndoor in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and\r\nflowers, and onward into the house. The dining-room to which he\r\nintroduced her still exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast\r\nlaid for Farfrae. It was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany\r\nfurniture of the deepest red-Spanish hues. Pembroke tables, with leaves\r\nhanging so low that they well-nigh touched the floor, stood against the\r\nwalls on legs and feet shaped like those of an elephant, and on one lay\r\nthree huge folio volumes\xe2\x80\x94a Family Bible, a \xe2\x80\x9cJosephus,\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cWhole\r\nDuty of Man.\xe2\x80\x9d In the chimney corner was a fire-grate with a fluted\r\nsemi-circular back, having urns and festoons cast in relief thereon,\r\nand the chairs were of the kind which, since that day, has cast lustre\r\nupon the names of Chippendale and Sheraton, though, in point of fact,\r\ntheir patterns may have been such as those illustrious carpenters never\r\nsaw or heard of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down\xe2\x80\x94Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a shake in his voice\r\nas he uttered her name, and sitting down himself he allowed his hands\r\nto hang between his knees while he looked upon the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nmother, then, is quite well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is rather worn out, sir, with travelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sailor\xe2\x80\x99s widow\xe2\x80\x94when did he die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather was lost last spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard winced at the word \xe2\x80\x9cfather,\xe2\x80\x9d thus applied. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you and she\r\ncome from abroad\xe2\x80\x94America or Australia?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We have been in England some years. I was twelve when we came here\r\nfrom Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh; exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d By such conversation he discovered the circumstances\r\nwhich had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that\r\nhe had long ago believed them to be in their graves. These things being\r\nclear, he returned to the present. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is your mother staying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Three Mariners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are her daughter Elizabeth-Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Henchard. He arose,\r\ncame close to her, and glanced in her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsuddenly turning away with a wet eye, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall take a note from me to\r\nyour mother. I should like to see her.... She is not left very well off\r\nby her late husband?\xe2\x80\x9d His eye fell on Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, which,\r\nthough a respectable suit of black, and her very best, were decidedly\r\nold-fashioned even to Casterbridge eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, glad that he had divined this without her\r\nbeing obliged to express it.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at the table and wrote a few lines, next taking from his\r\npocket-book a five-pound note, which he put in the envelope with the\r\nletter, adding to it, as by an afterthought, five shillings. Sealing\r\nthe whole up carefully, he directed it to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Newson, Three Mariners\r\nInn,\xe2\x80\x9d and handed the packet to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeliver it to her personally, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am glad\r\nto see you here, Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94very glad. We must have a long talk\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94but not just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her hand at parting, and held it so warmly that she, who had\r\nknown so little friendship, was much affected, and tears rose to her\r\naerial-grey eyes. The instant that she was gone Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s state showed\r\nitself more distinctly; having shut the door he sat in his dining-room\r\nstiffly erect, gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegad!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of that.\r\nPerhaps these are impostors\xe2\x80\x94and Susan and the child dead after all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as\r\nregarded her, at least, there could be little doubt. And a few hours\r\nwould settle the question of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s identity; for he had arranged\r\nin his note to see her that evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never rains but it pours!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. His keenly excited\r\ninterest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this\r\nevent, and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the\r\nday that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s moods.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn. Her mother, instead of\r\ntaking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting\r\nassistance, was much moved at sight of it. She did not read it at once,\r\nasking Elizabeth to describe her reception, and the very words Mr.\r\nHenchard used. Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned when her mother opened the\r\nletter. It ran thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeet me at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the\r\nBudmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The\r\nnews upsets me almost. The girl seems to be in ignorance. Keep her so\r\ntill I have seen you. M. H.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas. The amount was\r\nsignificant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back\r\nagain. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling\r\nElizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would\r\ngo alone. But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was\r\nnot at his house, nor did she hand the note to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nThe Ring at Casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest\r\nRoman Amphitheatres, if not the very finest, remaining in Britain.\r\n\r\nCasterbridge announced old Rome in every street, alley, and precinct.\r\nIt looked Roman, bespoke the art of Rome, concealed dead men of Rome.\r\nIt was impossible to dig more than a foot or two deep about the town\r\nfields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or other of\r\nthe Empire, who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a\r\nspace of fifteen hundred years. He was mostly found lying on his side,\r\nin an oval scoop in the chalk, like a chicken in its shell; his knees\r\ndrawn up to his chest; sometimes with the remains of his spear against\r\nhis arm, a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead, an urn\r\nat his knees, a jar at his throat, a bottle at his mouth; and mystified\r\nconjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of Casterbridge street\r\nboys and men, who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle\r\nas they passed by.\r\n\r\nImaginative inhabitants, who would have felt an unpleasantness at the\r\ndiscovery of a comparatively modern skeleton in their gardens, were\r\nquite unmoved by these hoary shapes. They had lived so long ago, their\r\ntime was so unlike the present, their hopes and motives were so widely\r\nremoved from ours, that between them and the living there seemed to\r\nstretch a gulf too wide for even a spirit to pass.\r\n\r\nThe Amphitheatre was a huge circular enclosure, with a notch at\r\nopposite extremities of its diameter north and south. From its sloping\r\ninternal form it might have been called the spittoon of the J\xc3\xb6tuns. It\r\nwas to Casterbridge what the ruined Coliseum is to modern Rome, and was\r\nnearly of the same magnitude. The dusk of evening was the proper hour\r\nat which a true impression of this suggestive place could be received.\r\nStanding in the middle of the arena at that time there by degrees\r\nbecame apparent its real vastness, which a cursory view from the summit\r\nat noon-day was apt to obscure. Melancholy, impressive, lonely, yet\r\naccessible from every part of the town, the historic circle was the\r\nfrequent spot for appointments of a furtive kind. Intrigues were\r\narranged there; tentative meetings were there experimented after\r\ndivisions and feuds. But one kind of appointment\xe2\x80\x94in itself the most\r\ncommon of any\xe2\x80\x94seldom had place in the Amphitheatre: that of happy\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nWhy, seeing that it was pre-eminently an airy, accessible, and\r\nsequestered spot for interviews, the cheerfullest form of those\r\noccurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin, would be a\r\ncurious inquiry. Perhaps it was because its associations had about them\r\nsomething sinister. Its history proved that. Apart from the sanguinary\r\nnature of the games originally played therein, such incidents attached\r\nto its past as these: that for scores of years the town-gallows had\r\nstood at one corner; that in 1705 a woman who had murdered her husband\r\nwas half-strangled and then burnt there in the presence of ten thousand\r\nspectators. Tradition reports that at a certain stage of the burning\r\nher heart burst and leapt out of her body, to the terror of them all,\r\nand that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly\r\nfor hot roast after that. In addition to these old tragedies,\r\npugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent\r\ndates in that secluded arena, entirely invisible to the outside world\r\nsave by climbing to the top of the enclosure, which few townspeople in\r\nthe daily round of their lives ever took the trouble to do. So that,\r\nthough close to the turnpike-road, crimes might be perpetrated there\r\nunseen at mid-day.\r\n\r\nSome boys had latterly tried to impart gaiety to the ruin by using the\r\ncentral arena as a cricket-ground. But the game usually languished for\r\nthe aforesaid reason\xe2\x80\x94the dismal privacy which the earthen circle\r\nenforced, shutting out every appreciative passer\xe2\x80\x99s vision, every\r\ncommendatory remark from outsiders\xe2\x80\x94everything, except the sky; and to\r\nplay at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house.\r\nPossibly, too, the boys were timid, for some old people said that at\r\ncertain moments in the summer time, in broad daylight, persons sitting\r\nwith a book or dozing in the arena had, on lifting their eyes, beheld\r\nthe slopes lined with a gazing legion of Hadrian\xe2\x80\x99s soldiery as if\r\nwatching the gladiatorial combat; and had heard the roar of their\r\nexcited voices, that the scene would remain but a moment, like a\r\nlightning flash, and then disappear.\r\n\r\nIt was related that there still remained under the south entrance\r\nexcavated cells for the reception of the wild animals and athletes who\r\ntook part in the games. The arena was still smooth and circular, as if\r\nused for its original purpose not so very long ago. The sloping\r\npathways by which spectators had ascended to their seats were pathways\r\nyet. But the whole was grown over with grass, which now, at the end of\r\nsummer, was bearded with withered bents that formed waves under the\r\nbrush of the wind, returning to the attentive ear \xc3\x86olian modulations,\r\nand detaining for moments the flying globes of thistledown.\r\n\r\nHenchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation\r\nwhich he could think of for meeting his long-lost wife, and at the same\r\ntime as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall. As Mayor\r\nof the town, with a reputation to keep up, he could not invite her to\r\ncome to his house till some definite course had been decided on.\r\n\r\nJust before eight he approached the deserted earth-work and entered by\r\nthe south path which descended over the _d\xc3\xa9bris_ of the former dens. In\r\na few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great\r\nnorth gap, or public gateway. They met in the middle of the arena.\r\nNeither spoke just at first\xe2\x80\x94there was no necessity for speech\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\npoor woman leant against Henchard, who supported her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t drink,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low, halting, apologetic voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhear, Susan?\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink now\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t since that night.\xe2\x80\x9d Those were\r\nhis first words.\r\n\r\nHe felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood. After a\r\nminute or two he again began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had known you were living, Susan! But there was every reason to\r\nsuppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every possible\r\nstep to find you\xe2\x80\x94travelled\xe2\x80\x94advertised. My opinion at last was that you\r\nhad started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your\r\nvoyage. Why did you keep silent like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Michael! because of him\xe2\x80\x94what other reason could there be? I thought\r\nI owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives\xe2\x80\x94foolishly I\r\nbelieved there was something solemn and binding in the bargain; I\r\nthought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so\r\nmuch for me in good faith. I meet you now only as his widow\xe2\x80\x94I consider\r\nmyself that, and that I have no claim upon you. Had he not died I\r\nshould never have come\xe2\x80\x94never! Of that you may be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut-tut! How could you be so simple?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Yet it would have been very wicked\xe2\x80\x94if I had not thought\r\nlike that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan, almost crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94so it would. It is only that which makes me feel \xe2\x80\x99ee an\r\ninnocent woman. But\xe2\x80\x94to lead me into this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Michael?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this difficulty about our living together again, and\r\nElizabeth-Jane. She cannot be told all\xe2\x80\x94she would so despise us both\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94I could not bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was why she was brought up in ignorance of you. I could not bear\r\nit either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and\r\ngetting matters straight in spite of it. You have heard I am in a large\r\nway of business here\xe2\x80\x94that I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our\r\ndisgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and\r\ndaughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nrub o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go away at once. I only came to see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\xe2\x80\x94you mistake me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with kindly\r\nseverity. \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a\r\ncottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I\r\nmeet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house\r\nas my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half\r\ndone in thinking o\xe2\x80\x99t. This would leave my shady, headstrong,\r\ndisgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would\r\nbe yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own\r\nonly child under my roof, as well as my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\xe2\x80\x9d she said meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cI came here for\r\nthe sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again\r\nto-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now; we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard gently. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave again. Think over the plan I have proposed for a\r\nfew hours; and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t hit upon a better one we\xe2\x80\x99ll adopt it. I\r\nhave to be away for a day or two on business, unfortunately; but during\r\nthat time you can get lodgings\xe2\x80\x94the only ones in the town fit for you\r\nare those over the china-shop in High Street\xe2\x80\x94and you can also look for\r\na cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the lodgings are in High Street they are dear, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94you _must_ start genteel if our plan is to be carried out.\r\nLook to me for money. Have you enough till I come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you comfortable at the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and\r\nours?\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me most anxious of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the\r\ntruth. How could she ever suppose such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like the idea of repeating our marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Henchard, after\r\na pause. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems the only right course, after all this. Now I think I\r\nmust go back to Elizabeth-Jane, and tell her that our kinsman, Mr.\r\nHenchard, kindly wishes us to stay in the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94arrange that yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go some way with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Don\xe2\x80\x99t run any risk!\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI can find my\r\nway back\xe2\x80\x94it is not late. Please let me go alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut just one word. Do you forgive me, Susan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe murmured something; but seemed to find it difficult to frame her\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94all in good time,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cJudge me by my future\r\nworks\xe2\x80\x94good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe retreated, and stood at the upper side of the Amphitheatre while his\r\nwife passed out through the lower way, and descended under the trees to\r\nthe town. Then Henchard himself went homeward, going so fast that by\r\nthe time he reached his door he was almost upon the heels of the\r\nunconscious woman from whom he had just parted. He watched her up the\r\nstreet, and turned into his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nOn entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the\r\nMayor walked on through the tunnel-shaped passage into the garden, and\r\nthence by the back door towards the stores and granaries. A light shone\r\nfrom the office-window, and there being no blind to screen the interior\r\nHenchard could see Donald Farfrae still seated where he had left him,\r\ninitiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling\r\nthe books. Henchard entered, merely observing, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me interrupt\r\nyou, if ye will stay so late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood behind Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s chair, watching his dexterity in clearing up\r\nthe numerical fogs which had been allowed to grow so thick in\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s books as almost to baffle even the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s perspicacity.\r\nThe corn-factor\xe2\x80\x99s mien was half admiring, and yet it was not without a\r\ndash of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind\r\nto such finnikin details. Henchard himself was mentally and physically\r\nunfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper; he had in a modern\r\nsense received the education of Achilles, and found penmanship a\r\ntantalizing art.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall do no more to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length, spreading his great\r\nhand over the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s time enough to-morrow. Come indoors with\r\nme and have some supper. Now you shall! I am determined on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He shut\r\nthe account-books with friendly force.\r\n\r\nDonald had wished to get to his lodgings; but he already saw that his\r\nfriend and employer was a man who knew no moderation in his requests\r\nand impulses, and he yielded gracefully. He liked Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s warmth,\r\neven if it inconvenienced him; the great difference in their characters\r\nadding to the liking.\r\n\r\nThey locked up the office, and the young man followed his companion\r\nthrough the private little door which, admitting directly into\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s garden, permitted a passage from the utilitarian to the\r\nbeautiful at one step. The garden was silent, dewy, and full of\r\nperfume. It extended a long way back from the house, first as lawn and\r\nflower-beds, then as fruit-garden, where the long-tied espaliers, as\r\nold as the old house itself, had grown so stout, and cramped, and\r\ngnarled that they had pulled their stakes out of the ground and stood\r\ndistorted and writhing in vegetable agony, like leafy Laocoons. The\r\nflowers which smelt so sweetly were not discernible; and they passed\r\nthrough them into the house.\r\n\r\nThe hospitalities of the morning were repeated, and when they were over\r\nHenchard said, \xe2\x80\x9cPull your chair round to the fireplace, my dear fellow,\r\nand let\xe2\x80\x99s make a blaze\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I hate like a black grate, even\r\nin September.\xe2\x80\x9d He applied a light to the laid-in fuel, and a cheerful\r\nradiance spread around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cthat two men should meet as we have done\r\non a purely business ground, and that at the end of the first day I\r\nshould wish to speak to \xe2\x80\x99ee on a family matter. But, damn it all, I am\r\na lonely man, Farfrae: I have nobody else to speak to; and why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell it to \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to hear it, if I can be of any service,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald,\r\nallowing his eyes to travel over the intricate wood-carvings of the\r\nchimney-piece, representing garlanded lyres, shields, and quivers, on\r\neither side of a draped ox-skull, and flanked by heads of Apollo and\r\nDiana in low relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not been always what I am now,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Henchard, his firm deep\r\nvoice being ever so little shaken. He was plainly under that strange\r\ninfluence which sometimes prompts men to confide to the new-found\r\nfriend what they will not tell to the old. \xe2\x80\x9cI began life as a working\r\nhay-trusser, and when I was eighteen I married on the strength o\xe2\x80\x99 my\r\ncalling. Would you think me a married man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard in the town that you were a widower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes\xe2\x80\x94you would naturally have heard that. Well, I lost my wife\r\nnineteen years ago or so\xe2\x80\x94by my own fault.... This is how it came about.\r\nOne summer evening I was travelling for employment, and she was walking\r\nat my side, carrying the baby, our only child. We came to a booth in a\r\ncountry fair. I was a drinking man at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard paused a moment, threw himself back so that his elbow rested\r\non the table, his forehead being shaded by his hand, which, however,\r\ndid not hide the marks of introspective inflexibility on his features\r\nas he narrated in fullest detail the incidents of the transaction with\r\nthe sailor. The tinge of indifference which had at first been visible\r\nin the Scotchman now disappeared.\r\n\r\nHenchard went on to describe his attempts to find his wife; the oath he\r\nswore; the solitary life he led during the years which followed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave kept my oath for nineteen years,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on; \xe2\x80\x9cI have risen to\r\nwhat you see me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94no wife could I hear of in all that time; and being by nature\r\nsomething of a woman-hater, I have found it no hardship to keep mostly\r\nat a distance from the sex. No wife could I hear of, I say, till this\r\nvery day. And now\xe2\x80\x94she has come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back, has she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning\xe2\x80\x94this very morning. And what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan ye no\xe2\x80\x99 take her and live with her, and make some amends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve planned and proposed. But, Farfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard\r\ngloomily, \xe2\x80\x9cby doing right with Susan I wrong another innocent woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe don\xe2\x80\x99t say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the nature of things, Farfrae, it is almost impossible that a man\r\nof my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlife without making more blunders than one. It has been my custom for\r\nmany years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business,\r\nparticularly in the potato and root season. I do a large trade wi\xe2\x80\x99 them\r\nin that line. Well, one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill,\r\nand in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes\r\nsuffer from, on account o\xe2\x80\x99 the loneliness of my domestic life, when the\r\nworld seems to have the blackness of hell, and, like Job, I could curse\r\nthe day that gave me birth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now, I never feel like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen pray to God that you never may, young man. While in this state I\r\nwas taken pity on by a woman\xe2\x80\x94a young lady I should call her, for she\r\nwas of good family, well bred, and well educated\xe2\x80\x94the daughter of some\r\nharum-scarum military officer who had got into difficulties, and had\r\nhis pay sequestrated. He was dead now, and her mother too, and she was\r\nas lonely as I. This young creature was staying at the boarding-house\r\nwhere I happened to have my lodging; and when I was pulled down she\r\ntook upon herself to nurse me. From that she got to have a foolish\r\nliking for me. Heaven knows why, for I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it. But being\r\ntogether in the same house, and her feeling warm, we got naturally\r\nintimate. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into particulars of what our relations were. It is\r\nenough to say that we honestly meant to marry. There arose a scandal,\r\nwhich did me no harm, but was of course ruin to her. Though, Farfrae,\r\nbetween you and me, as man and man, I solemnly declare that\r\nphilandering with womankind has neither been my vice nor my virtue. She\r\nwas terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At\r\nlast I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my\r\naccount, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget to tell me so in letters one after another;\r\ntill latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had\r\nnot heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only\r\nreturn I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan\r\nbeing alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was.\r\nShe jumped for joy, and we should no doubt soon have been married\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\nbehold, Susan appears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the\r\ndegree of his simple experiences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow see what injury a man may cause around him! Even after that\r\nwrong-doing at the fair when I was young, if I had never been so\r\nselfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey,\r\nto the injury of her name, all might now be well. Yet, as it stands, I\r\nmust bitterly disappoint one of these women; and it is the second. My\r\nfirst duty is to Susan\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are both in a very melancholy position, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Donald.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are! For myself I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twill all end one way. But these\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard paused in reverie. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel I should like to treat the\r\nsecond, no less than the first, as kindly as a man can in such a case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, it cannet be helped!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with philosophic\r\nwoefulness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mun write to the young lady, and in your letter you\r\nmust put it plain and honest that it turns out she cannet be your wife,\r\nthe first having come back; that ye cannet see her more; and that\xe2\x80\x94ye\r\nwish her weel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do. \xe2\x80\x99Od seize it, I must do a little more than that! I\r\nmust\xe2\x80\x94though she did always brag about her rich uncle or rich aunt, and\r\nher expectations from \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94I must send a useful sum of money to her, I\r\nsuppose\xe2\x80\x94just as a little recompense, poor girl.... Now, will you help\r\nme in this, and draw up an explanation to her of all I\xe2\x80\x99ve told ye,\r\nbreaking it as gently as you can? I\xe2\x80\x99m so bad at letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you quite all yet. My wife Susan has my daughter\r\nwith her\xe2\x80\x94the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and this girl knows\r\nnothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage. She\r\nhas grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her\r\nmother, and who is now dead, was her father, and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\r\nWhat her mother has always felt, she and I together feel now\xe2\x80\x94that we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth.\r\nNow what would you do?\xe2\x80\x94I want your advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99d run the risk, and tell her the truth. She\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive ye\r\nboth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to let her know the truth. Her\r\nmother and I be going to marry again; and it will not only help us to\r\nkeep our child\xe2\x80\x99s respect, but it will be more proper. Susan looks upon\r\nherself as the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s widow, and won\xe2\x80\x99t think o\xe2\x80\x99 living with me as\r\nformerly without another religious ceremony\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae thereupon said no more. The letter to the young Jersey woman\r\nwas carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying,\r\nas the Scotchman left, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some\r\nfriend o\xe2\x80\x99 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so\r\nthriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his\r\npocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for ye!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque,\r\ntook it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that it will go off so easily!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing\xe2\x80\x94God\r\nknows! Now then, to make amends to Susan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nThe cottage which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her\r\nname of Newson\xe2\x80\x94in pursuance of their plan\xe2\x80\x94was in the upper or western\r\npart of the town, near the Roman wall, and the avenue which\r\novershadowed it. The evening sun seemed to shine more yellowly there\r\nthan anywhere else this autumn\xe2\x80\x94stretching its rays, as the hours grew\r\nlater, under the lowest sycamore boughs, and steeping the ground-floor\r\nof the dwelling, with its green shutters, in a substratum of radiance\r\nwhich the foliage screened from the upper parts. Beneath these\r\nsycamores on the town walls could be seen from the sitting-room the\r\ntumuli and earth forts of the distant uplands; making it altogether a\r\npleasant spot, with the usual touch of melancholy that a past-marked\r\nprospect lends.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mother and daughter were comfortably installed, with a\r\nwhite-aproned servant and all complete, Henchard paid them a visit, and\r\nremained to tea. During the entertainment Elizabeth was carefully\r\nhoodwinked by the very general tone of the conversation that\r\nprevailed\xe2\x80\x94a proceeding which seemed to afford some humour to Henchard,\r\nthough his wife was not particularly happy in it. The visit was\r\nrepeated again and again with business-like determination by the Mayor,\r\nwho seemed to have schooled himself into a course of strict mechanical\r\nrightness towards this woman of prior claim, at any expense to the\r\nlater one and to his own sentiments.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon the daughter was not indoors when Henchard came, and he\r\nsaid drily, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name\r\nthe happy day, Susan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe poor woman smiled faintly; she did not enjoy pleasantries on a\r\nsituation into which she had entered solely for the sake of her girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreputation. She liked them so little, indeed, that there was room for\r\nwonder why she had countenanced deception at all, and had not bravely\r\nlet the girl know her history. But the flesh is weak; and the true\r\nexplanation came in due course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Michael!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid all this is taking up your time and\r\ngiving trouble\xe2\x80\x94when I did not expect any such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d And she looked at\r\nhim and at his dress as a man of affluence, and at the furniture he had\r\nprovided for the room\xe2\x80\x94ornate and lavish to her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, in rough benignity. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is only a\r\ncottage\xe2\x80\x94it costs me next to nothing. And as to taking up my time\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here\r\nhis red and black visage kindled with satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a splendid\r\nfellow to superintend my business now\xe2\x80\x94a man whose like I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been\r\nable to lay hands on before. I shall soon be able to leave everything\r\nto him, and have more time to call my own than I\xe2\x80\x99ve had for these last\r\ntwenty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s visits here grew so frequent and so regular that it soon\r\nbecame whispered, and then openly discussed in Casterbridge that the\r\nmasterful, coercive Mayor of the town was raptured and enervated by the\r\ngenteel widow Mrs. Newson. His well-known haughty indifference to the\r\nsociety of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex,\r\ncontributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic\r\nmatter enough. That such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was\r\ninexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family\r\naffair in which sentimental passion had no place; for it was known that\r\nthey were related in some way. Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys\r\ncalled her \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes Henchard overheard this epithet when\r\nthey passed together along the Walks\xe2\x80\x94as the avenues on the walls were\r\nnamed\xe2\x80\x94at which his face would darken with an expression of\r\ndestructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see; but he said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nHe pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with\r\nthis pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit to\r\nhis conscientiousness. Nobody would have conceived from his outward\r\ndemeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as\r\nstimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing but\r\nthree large resolves\xe2\x80\x94one, to make amends to his neglected Susan,\r\nanother, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth-Jane under his\r\npaternal eye; and a third, to castigate himself with the thorns which\r\nthese restitutory acts brought in their train; among them the lowering\r\nof his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nSusan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when\r\nshe stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the\r\nwedding-day to take her and Elizabeth-Jane to church. It was a windless\r\nmorning of warm November rain, which floated down like meal, and lay in\r\na powdery form on the nap of hats and coats. Few people had gathered\r\nround the church door though they were well packed within. The\r\nScotchman, who assisted as groomsman, was of course the only one\r\npresent, beyond the chief actors, who knew the true situation of the\r\ncontracting parties. He, however, was too inexperienced, too\r\nthoughtful, too judicial, too strongly conscious of the serious side of\r\nthe business, to enter into the scene in its dramatic aspect. That\r\nrequired the special genius of Christopher Coney, Solomon Longways,\r\nBuzzford, and their fellows. But they knew nothing of the secret;\r\nthough, as the time for coming out of church drew on, they gathered on\r\nthe pavement adjoining, and expounded the subject according to their\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis five-and-forty years since I had my settlement in this here\r\ntown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coney; \xe2\x80\x9cbut daze me if I ever see a man wait so long before\r\nto take so little! There\xe2\x80\x99s a chance even for thee after this, Nance\r\nMockridge.\xe2\x80\x9d The remark was addressed to a woman who stood behind his\r\nshoulder\xe2\x80\x94the same who had exhibited Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s bad bread in public when\r\nElizabeth and her mother entered Casterbridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe cust if I\xe2\x80\x99d marry any such as he, or thee either,\xe2\x80\x9d replied that\r\nlady. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for thee, Christopher, we know what ye be, and the less said\r\nthe better. And as for he\xe2\x80\x94well, there\xe2\x80\x94(lowering her voice) \xe2\x80\x99tis said \xe2\x80\x99a\r\nwas a poor parish \xe2\x80\x99prentice\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it for all the world\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x99a\r\nwas a poor parish \xe2\x80\x99prentice, that began life wi\xe2\x80\x99 no more belonging to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99en than a carrion crow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now he\xe2\x80\x99s worth ever so much a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Longways. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a\r\nman is said to be worth so much a minute, he\xe2\x80\x99s a man to be considered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning, he saw a circular disc reticulated with creases, and\r\nrecognized the smiling countenance of the fat woman who had asked for\r\nanother song at the Three Mariners. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mother Cuxsom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99s this? Here\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Newson, a mere skellinton, has got another\r\nhusband to keep her, while a woman of your tonnage have not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not. Nor another to beat me.... Ah, yes, Cuxsom\xe2\x80\x99s gone, and so\r\nshall leather breeches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; with the blessing of God leather breeches shall go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t worth my old while to think of another husband,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nMrs. Cuxsom. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay my life I\xe2\x80\x99m as respectable born as she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue; your mother was a very good woman\xe2\x80\x94I can mind her. She were\r\nrewarded by the Agricultural Society for having begot the greatest\r\nnumber of healthy children without parish assistance, and other\r\nvirtuous marvels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas that that kept us so low upon ground\xe2\x80\x94that great hungry family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy. Where the pigs be many the wash runs thin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd dostn\xe2\x80\x99t mind how mother would sing, Christopher?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs.\r\nCuxsom, kindling at the retrospection; \xe2\x80\x9cand how we went with her to the\r\nparty at Mellstock, do ye mind?\xe2\x80\x94at old Dame Ledlow\xe2\x80\x99s, farmer Shinar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naunt, do ye mind?\xe2\x80\x94she we used to call Toad-skin, because her face were\r\nso yaller and freckled, do ye mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, hee-hee, I do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Christopher Coney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well do I\xe2\x80\x94for I was getting up husband-high at that time\xe2\x80\x94one-half\r\ngirl, and t\xe2\x80\x99other half woman, as one may say. And canst mind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nprodded Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder with her finger-tip, while her eyes twinkled\r\nbetween the crevices of their lids\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccanst mind the sherry-wine, and the\r\nzilver-snuffers, and how Joan Dummett was took bad when we were coming\r\nhome, and Jack Griggs was forced to carry her through the mud; and how\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a let her fall in Dairyman Sweet-apple\xe2\x80\x99s cow-barton, and we had to\r\nclane her gown wi\xe2\x80\x99 grass\xe2\x80\x94never such a mess as \xe2\x80\x99a were in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94that I do\xe2\x80\x94hee-hee, such doggery as there was in them ancient days,\r\nto be sure! Ah, the miles I used to walk then; and now I can hardly\r\nstep over a furrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir reminiscences were cut short by the appearance of the reunited\r\npair\xe2\x80\x94Henchard looking round upon the idlers with that ambiguous gaze of\r\nhis, which at one moment seemed to mean satisfaction, and at another\r\nfiery disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between \xe2\x80\x99em, though he do call himself a\r\nteetotaller,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nance Mockridge. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll wish her cake dough afore\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s done of him. There\xe2\x80\x99s a blue-beardy look about \xe2\x80\x99en; and \xe2\x80\x99twill out\r\nin time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s well enough! Some folk want their luck buttered. If I had a\r\nchoice as wide as the ocean sea I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish for a better man. A\r\npoor twanking woman like her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis a godsend for her, and hardly a pair\r\nof jumps or night-rail to her name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe plain little brougham drove off in the mist, and the idlers\r\ndispersed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we hardly know how to look at things in these times!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Solomon. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a man dropped down dead yesterday, not so very\r\nmany miles from here; and what wi\xe2\x80\x99 that, and this moist weather, \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nscarce worth one\xe2\x80\x99s while to begin any work o\xe2\x80\x99 consequence to-day. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin such a low key with drinking nothing but small table ninepenny this\r\nlast week or two that I shall call and warm up at the Mar\xe2\x80\x99ners as I\r\npass along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know but that I may as well go with \xe2\x80\x99ee, Solomon,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nChristopher; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as clammy as a cockle-snail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nA Martinmas summer of Mrs. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s life set in with her entry into\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s large house and respectable social orbit; and it was as\r\nbright as such summers well can be. Lest she should pine for deeper\r\naffection than he could give he made a point of showing some semblance\r\nof it in external action. Among other things he had the iron railings,\r\nthat had smiled sadly in dull rust for the last eighty years, painted a\r\nbright green, and the heavy-barred, small-paned Georgian sash windows\r\nenlivened with three coats of white. He was as kind to her as a man,\r\nmayor, and churchwarden could possibly be. The house was large, the\r\nrooms lofty, and the landings wide; and the two unassuming women\r\nscarcely made a perceptible addition to its contents.\r\n\r\nTo Elizabeth-Jane the time was a most triumphant one. The freedom she\r\nexperienced, the indulgence with which she was treated, went beyond her\r\nexpectations. The reposeful, easy, affluent life to which her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarriage had introduced her was, in truth, the beginning of a great\r\nchange in Elizabeth. She found she could have nice personal possessions\r\nand ornaments for the asking, and, as the medi\xc3\xa6val saying puts it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake, have, and keep, are pleasant words.\xe2\x80\x9d With peace of mind came\r\ndevelopment, and with development beauty. Knowledge\xe2\x80\x94the result of great\r\nnatural insight\xe2\x80\x94she did not lack; learning, accomplishment\xe2\x80\x94those, alas,\r\nshe had not; but as the winter and spring passed by her thin face and\r\nfigure filled out in rounder and softer curves; the lines and\r\ncontractions upon her young brow went away; the muddiness of skin which\r\nshe had looked upon as her lot by nature departed with a change to\r\nabundance of good things, and a bloom came upon her cheek. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, her grey, thoughtful eyes revealed an arch gaiety sometimes; but\r\nthis was infrequent; the sort of wisdom which looked from their pupils\r\ndid not readily keep company with these lighter moods. Like all people\r\nwho have known rough times, light-heartedness seemed to her too\r\nirrational and inconsequent to be indulged in except as a reckless dram\r\nnow and then; for she had been too early habituated to anxious\r\nreasoning to drop the habit suddenly. She felt none of those ups and\r\ndowns of spirit which beset so many people without cause; never\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nparaphrase a recent poet\xe2\x80\x94never a gloom in Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s soul but she\r\nwell knew how it came there; and her present cheerfulness was fairly\r\nproportionate to her solid guarantees for the same.\r\n\r\nIt might have been supposed that, given a girl rapidly becoming\r\ngood-looking, comfortably circumstanced, and for the first time in her\r\nlife commanding ready money, she would go and make a fool of herself by\r\ndress. But no. The reasonableness of almost everything that Elizabeth\r\ndid was nowhere more conspicuous than in this question of clothes. To\r\nkeep in the rear of opportunity in matters of indulgence is as valuable\r\na habit as to keep abreast of opportunity in matters of enterprise.\r\nThis unsophisticated girl did it by an innate perceptiveness that was\r\nalmost genius. Thus she refrained from bursting out like a water-flower\r\nthat spring, and clothing herself in puffings and knick-knacks, as most\r\nof the Casterbridge girls would have done in her circumstances. Her\r\ntriumph was tempered by circumspection, she had still that field-mouse\r\nfear of the coulter of destiny despite fair promise, which is common\r\namong the thoughtful who have suffered early from poverty and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be too gay on any account,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be tempting Providence to hurl mother and me down, and afflict us\r\nagain as He used to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe now see her in a black silk bonnet, velvet mantle or silk spencer,\r\ndark dress, and carrying a sunshade. In this latter article she drew\r\nthe line at fringe, and had it plain edged, with a little ivory ring\r\nfor keeping it closed. It was odd about the necessity for that\r\nsunshade. She discovered that with the clarification of her complexion\r\nand the birth of pink cheeks her skin had grown more sensitive to the\r\nsun\xe2\x80\x99s rays. She protected those cheeks forthwith, deeming spotlessness\r\npart of womanliness.\r\n\r\nHenchard had become very fond of her, and she went out with him more\r\nfrequently than with her mother now. Her appearance one day was so\r\nattractive that he looked at her critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI happened to have the ribbon by me, so I made it up,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered,\r\nthinking him perhaps dissatisfied with some rather bright trimming she\r\nhad donned for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94of course\xe2\x80\x94to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in his leonine way. \xe2\x80\x9cDo as you\r\nlike\xe2\x80\x94or rather as your mother advises ye. \xe2\x80\x99Od send\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to say\r\nto\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndoors she appeared with her hair divided by a parting that arched\r\nlike a white rainbow from ear to ear. All in front of this line was\r\ncovered with a thick encampment of curls; all behind was dressed\r\nsmoothly, and drawn to a knob.\r\n\r\nThe three members of the family were sitting at breakfast one day, and\r\nHenchard was looking silently, as he often did, at this head of hair,\r\nwhich in colour was brown\xe2\x80\x94rather light than dark. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hair\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hair\r\npromised to be black when she was a baby?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife.\r\n\r\nShe looked startled, jerked his foot warningly, and murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cBegad,\r\nI nearly forgot myself just now! What I meant was that the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hair\r\ncertainly looked as if it would be darker, when she was a baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did; but they alter so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Susan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir hair gets darker, I know\xe2\x80\x94but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware it lightened ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes.\xe2\x80\x9d And the same uneasy expression came out on her face, to which\r\nthe future held the key. It passed as Henchard went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so much the better. Now Susan, I want to have her called Miss\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x94not Miss Newson. Lots o\xe2\x80\x99 people do it already in\r\ncarelessness\xe2\x80\x94it is her legal name\xe2\x80\x94so it may as well be made her usual\r\nname\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t like t\xe2\x80\x99other name at all for my own flesh and blood. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nadvertise it in the Casterbridge paper\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way they do it. She\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. O no. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I shall do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, peremptorily. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, if she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwilling, you must wish it as much as I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes\xe2\x80\x94if she agrees let us do it by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently; it might have been\r\ncalled falsely, but that her manner was emotional and full of the\r\nearnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard. She went to\r\nElizabeth-Jane, whom she found sewing in her own sitting-room upstairs,\r\nand told her what had been proposed about her surname. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you\r\nagree\xe2\x80\x94is it not a slight upon Newson\xe2\x80\x94now he\xe2\x80\x99s dead and gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll think of it, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nWhen, later in the day, she saw Henchard, she adverted to the matter at\r\nonce, in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her\r\nmother had been persevered in. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish this change so very much,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish it? Why, my blessed fathers, what an ado you women make about a\r\ntrifle! I proposed it\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Now, \xe2\x80\x99Lizabeth-Jane, just please\r\nyourself. Curse me if I care what you do. Now, you understand, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee go agreeing to it to please me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the subject dropped, and nothing more was said, and nothing was\r\ndone, and Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson, and not by her legal\r\nname.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great corn and hay traffic conducted by Henchard throve\r\nunder the management of Donald Farfrae as it had never thriven before.\r\nIt had formerly moved in jolts; now it went on oiled casters. The old\r\ncrude _viv\xc3\xa2 voce_ system of Henchard, in which everything depended upon\r\nhis memory, and bargains were made by the tongue alone, was swept away.\r\nLetters and ledgers took the place of \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall\r\nhae\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d; and, as in all such cases of advance, the rugged\r\npicturesqueness of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences.\r\n\r\nThe position of Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s room\xe2\x80\x94rather high in the house, so that\r\nit commanded a view of the hay-stores and granaries across the\r\ngarden\xe2\x80\x94afforded her opportunity for accurate observation of what went\r\non there. She saw that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables. When\r\nwalking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, as if Farfrae were a younger brother, bearing so heavily that\r\nhis slight frame bent under the weight. Occasionally she would hear a\r\nperfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard, arising from something\r\nDonald had said, the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at\r\nall. In Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young\r\nman as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations.\r\nDonald\xe2\x80\x99s brightness of intellect maintained in the corn-factor the\r\nadmiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting. The poor\r\nopinion, and but ill-concealed, that he entertained of the slim\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s physical girth, strength, and dash was more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains.\r\n\r\nHer quiet eye discerned that Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s tigerish affection for the\r\nyounger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then\r\nresulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a\r\nmoment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence. One day, looking\r\ndown on their figures from on high, she heard the latter remark, as\r\nthey stood in the doorway between the garden and yard, that their habit\r\nof walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvalue as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where\r\nthe principal was not. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Od damn it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s all the\r\nworld! I like a fellow to talk to. Now come along and hae some supper,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t take too much thought about things, or ye\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she walked with her mother, on the other hand, she often beheld\r\nthe Scotchman looking at them with a curious interest. The fact that he\r\nhad met her at the Three Mariners was insufficient to account for it,\r\nsince on the occasions on which she had entered his room he had never\r\nraised his eyes. Besides, it was at her mother more particularly than\r\nat herself that he looked, to Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s half-conscious,\r\nsimple-minded, perhaps pardonable, disappointment. Thus she could not\r\naccount for this interest by her own attractiveness, and she decided\r\nthat it might be apparent only\xe2\x80\x94a way of turning his eyes that Mr.\r\nFarfrae had.\r\n\r\nShe did not divine the ample explanation of his manner, without\r\npersonal vanity, that was afforded by the fact of Donald being the\r\ndepositary of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in respect of his past treatment of\r\nthe pale, chastened mother who walked by her side. Her conjectures on\r\nthat past never went further than faint ones based on things casually\r\nheard and seen\xe2\x80\x94mere guesses that Henchard and her mother might have\r\nbeen lovers in their younger days, who had quarrelled and parted.\r\n\r\nCasterbridge, as has been hinted, was a place deposited in the block\r\nupon a corn-field. There was no suburb in the modern sense, or\r\ntransitional intermixture of town and down. It stood, with regard to\r\nthe wide fertile land adjoining, clean-cut and distinct, like a\r\nchess-board on a green tablecloth. The farmer\xe2\x80\x99s boy could sit under his\r\nbarley-mow and pitch a stone into the office-window of the town-clerk;\r\nreapers at work among the sheaves nodded to acquaintances standing on\r\nthe pavement-corner; the red-robed judge, when he condemned a\r\nsheep-stealer, pronounced sentence to the tune of Baa, that floated in\r\nat the window from the remainder of the flock browsing hard by; and at\r\nexecutions the waiting crowd stood in a meadow immediately before the\r\ndrop, out of which the cows had been temporarily driven to give the\r\nspectators room.\r\n\r\nThe corn grown on the upland side of the borough was garnered by\r\nfarmers who lived in an eastern purlieu called Durnover. Here\r\nwheat-ricks overhung the old Roman street, and thrust their eaves\r\nagainst the church tower; green-thatched barns, with doorways as high\r\nas the gates of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s temple, opened directly upon the main\r\nthoroughfare. Barns indeed were so numerous as to alternate with every\r\nhalf-dozen houses along the way. Here lived burgesses who daily walked\r\nthe fallow; shepherds in an intra-mural squeeze. A street of farmers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhomesteads\xe2\x80\x94a street ruled by a mayor and corporation, yet echoing with\r\nthe thump of the flail, the flutter of the winnowing-fan, and the purr\r\nof the milk into the pails\xe2\x80\x94a street which had nothing urban in it\r\nwhatever\xe2\x80\x94this was the Durnover end of Casterbridge.\r\n\r\nHenchard, as was natural, dealt largely with this nursery or bed of\r\nsmall farmers close at hand\xe2\x80\x94and his waggons were often down that way.\r\nOne day, when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from\r\none of the aforesaid farms, Elizabeth-Jane received a note by hand,\r\nasking her to oblige the writer by coming at once to a granary on\r\nDurnover Hill. As this was the granary whose contents Henchard was\r\nremoving, she thought the request had something to do with his\r\nbusiness, and proceeded thither as soon as she had put on her bonnet.\r\nThe granary was just within the farm-yard, and stood on stone staddles,\r\nhigh enough for persons to walk under. The gates were open, but nobody\r\nwas within. However, she entered and waited. Presently she saw a figure\r\napproaching the gate\xe2\x80\x94that of Donald Farfrae. He looked up at the church\r\nclock, and came in. By some unaccountable shyness, some wish not to\r\nmeet him there alone, she quickly ascended the step-ladder leading to\r\nthe granary door, and entered it before he had seen her. Farfrae\r\nadvanced, imagining himself in solitude, and a few drops of rain\r\nbeginning to fall he moved and stood under the shelter where she had\r\njust been standing. Here he leant against one of the staddles, and gave\r\nhimself up to patience. He, too, was plainly expecting some one; could\r\nit be herself? If so, why? In a few minutes he looked at his watch, and\r\nthen pulled out a note, a duplicate of the one she had herself\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThis situation began to be very awkward, and the longer she waited the\r\nmore awkward it became. To emerge from a door just above his head and\r\ndescend the ladder, and show she had been in hiding there, would look\r\nso very foolish that she still waited on. A winnowing machine stood\r\nclose beside her, and to relieve her suspense she gently moved the\r\nhandle; whereupon a cloud of wheat husks flew out into her face, and\r\ncovered her clothes and bonnet, and stuck into the fur of her\r\nvictorine. He must have heard the slight movement for he looked up, and\r\nthen ascended the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Newson,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as soon as he could see into the\r\ngranary. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were there. I have kept the appointment,\r\nand am at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Mr. Farfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cso have I. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was you\r\nwho wished to see me, otherwise I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to see you? O no\xe2\x80\x94at least, that is, I am afraid there may be\r\na mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ask me to come here? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you write this?\xe2\x80\x9d Elizabeth held\r\nout her note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Indeed, at no hand would I have thought of it! And for you\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou ask me? This is not your writing?\xe2\x80\x9d And he held up his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that really so! Then it\xe2\x80\x99s somebody wanting to see us both.\r\nPerhaps we would do well to wait a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActing on this consideration they lingered, Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s face being\r\narranged to an expression of preternatural composure, and the young\r\nScot, at every footstep in the street without, looking from under the\r\ngranary to see if the passer were about to enter and declare himself\r\ntheir summoner. They watched individual drops of rain creeping down the\r\nthatch of the opposite rick\xe2\x80\x94straw after straw\xe2\x80\x94till they reached the\r\nbottom; but nobody came, and the granary roof began to drip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person is not likely to be coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a trick\r\nperhaps, and if so, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity to waste our time like this, and\r\nso much to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a great liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true, Miss Newson. We\xe2\x80\x99ll hear news of this some day depend on\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nand who it was that did it. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand for it hindering myself;\r\nbut you, Miss Newson\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94much,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither do I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey lapsed again into silence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are anxious to get back to\r\nScotland, I suppose, Mr. Farfrae?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, Miss Newson. Why would I be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only supposed you might be from the song you sang at the Three\r\nMariners\xe2\x80\x94about Scotland and home, I mean\xe2\x80\x94which you seemed to feel so\r\ndeep down in your heart; so that we all felt for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94and I did sing there\xe2\x80\x94I did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 But, Miss Newson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Donald\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nmusically undulated between two semi-tones as it always did when he\r\nbecame earnest\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s well you feel a song for a few minutes, and your\r\neyes they get quite tearful; but you finish it, and for all you felt\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it or think of it again for a long while. O no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to go back! Yet I\xe2\x80\x99ll sing the song to you wi\xe2\x80\x99 pleasure whenever\r\nyou like. I could sing it now, and not mind at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, indeed. But I fear I must go\xe2\x80\x94rain or no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! Then, Miss Newson, ye had better say nothing about this hoax, and\r\ntake no heed of it. And if the person should say anything to you, be\r\ncivil to him or her, as if you did not mind it\xe2\x80\x94so you\xe2\x80\x99ll take the\r\nclever person\xe2\x80\x99s laugh away.\xe2\x80\x9d In speaking his eyes became fixed upon her\r\ndress, still sown with wheat husks. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s husks and dust on you.\r\nPerhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in tones of extreme delicacy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s very bad to let rain come upon clothes when there\xe2\x80\x99s chaff on them.\r\nIt washes in and spoils them. Let me help you\xe2\x80\x94blowing is the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Elizabeth neither assented nor dissented Donald Farfrae began\r\nblowing her back hair, and her side hair, and her neck, and the crown\r\nof her bonnet, and the fur of her victorine, Elizabeth saying, \xe2\x80\x9cO,\r\nthank you,\xe2\x80\x9d at every puff. At last she was fairly clean, though\r\nFarfrae, having got over his first concern at the situation, seemed in\r\nno manner of hurry to be gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94now I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get ye an umbrella,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe declined the offer, stepped out and was gone. Farfrae walked slowly\r\nafter, looking thoughtfully at her diminishing figure, and whistling in\r\nundertones, \xe2\x80\x9cAs I came down through Cannobie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nAt first Miss Newson\xe2\x80\x99s budding beauty was not regarded with much\r\ninterest by anybody in Casterbridge. Donald Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, it is true,\r\nwas now attracted by the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s so-called stepdaughter, but he was\r\nonly one. The truth is that she was but a poor illustrative instance of\r\nthe prophet Baruch\xe2\x80\x99s sly definition: \xe2\x80\x9cThe virgin that loveth to go\r\ngay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she walked abroad she seemed to be occupied with an inner chamber\r\nof ideas, and to have slight need for visible objects. She formed\r\ncurious resolves on checking gay fancies in the matter of clothes,\r\nbecause it was inconsistent with her past life to blossom gaudily the\r\nmoment she had become possessed of money. But nothing is more insidious\r\nthan the evolution of wishes from mere fancies, and of wants from mere\r\nwishes. Henchard gave Elizabeth-Jane a box of delicately-tinted gloves\r\none spring day. She wanted to wear them to show her appreciation of his\r\nkindness, but she had no bonnet that would harmonize. As an artistic\r\nindulgence she thought she would have such a bonnet. When she had a\r\nbonnet that would go with the gloves she had no dress that would go\r\nwith the bonnet. It was now absolutely necessary to finish; she ordered\r\nthe requisite article, and found that she had no sunshade to go with\r\nthe dress. In for a penny in for a pound; she bought the sunshade, and\r\nthe whole structure was at last complete.\r\n\r\nEverybody was attracted, and some said that her bygone simplicity was\r\nthe art that conceals art, the \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate imposition\xe2\x80\x9d of Rochefoucauld;\r\nshe had produced an effect, a contrast, and it had been done on\r\npurpose. As a matter of fact this was not true, but it had its result;\r\nfor as soon as Casterbridge thought her artful it thought her worth\r\nnotice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the first time in my life that I have been so much\r\nadmired,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself; \xe2\x80\x9cthough perhaps it is by those whose\r\nadmiration is not worth having.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Donald Farfrae admired her, too; and altogether the time was an\r\nexciting one; sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly,\r\nfor in former days she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be\r\ndistinctively feminine. After an unprecedented success one day she came\r\nindoors, went upstairs, and leant upon her bed face downwards quite\r\nforgetting the possible creasing and damage. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be? Here am I setting up as the town beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had thought it over, her usual fear of exaggerating\r\nappearances engendered a deep sadness. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something wrong in all\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d she mused. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they only knew what an unfinished girl I am\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk Italian, or use globes, or show any of the accomplishments\r\nthey learn at boarding schools, how they would despise me! Better sell\r\nall this finery and buy myself grammar-books and dictionaries and a\r\nhistory of all the philosophies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked from the window and saw Henchard and Farfrae in the hay-yard\r\ntalking, with that impetuous cordiality on the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s part, and genial\r\nmodesty on the younger man\xe2\x80\x99s, that was now so generally observable in\r\ntheir intercourse. Friendship between man and man; what a rugged\r\nstrength there was in it, as evinced by these two. And yet the seed\r\nthat was to lift the foundation of this friendship was at that moment\r\ntaking root in a chink of its structure.\r\n\r\nIt was about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock; the men were dropping off homeward one by\r\none. The last to leave was a round-shouldered, blinking young man of\r\nnineteen or twenty, whose mouth fell ajar on the slightest provocation,\r\nseemingly because there was no chin to support it. Henchard called\r\naloud to him as he went out of the gate, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94Abel Whittle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhittle turned, and ran back a few steps. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in\r\nbreathless deprecation, as if he knew what was coming next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more\xe2\x80\x94be in time to-morrow morning. You see what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done, and\r\nyou hear what I say, and you know I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be trifled with any\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Abel Whittle left, and Henchard and Farfrae; and\r\nElizabeth saw no more of them.\r\n\r\nNow there was good reason for this command on Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s part. Poor\r\nAbel, as he was called, had an inveterate habit of over-sleeping\r\nhimself and coming late to his work. His anxious will was to be among\r\nthe earliest; but if his comrades omitted to pull the string that he\r\nalways tied round his great toe and left hanging out the window for\r\nthat purpose, his will was as wind. He did not arrive in time.\r\n\r\nAs he was often second hand at the hay-weighing, or at the crane which\r\nlifted the sacks, or was one of those who had to accompany the waggons\r\ninto the country to fetch away stacks that had been purchased, this\r\naffliction of Abel\xe2\x80\x99s was productive of much inconvenience. For two\r\nmornings in the present week he had kept the others waiting nearly an\r\nhour; hence Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s threat. It now remained to be seen what would\r\nhappen to-morrow.\r\n\r\nSix o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, and there was no Whittle. At half-past six Henchard\r\nentered the yard; the waggon was horsed that Abel was to accompany; and\r\nthe other man had been waiting twenty minutes. Then Henchard swore, and\r\nWhittle coming up breathless at that instant, the corn-factor turned on\r\nhim, and declared with an oath that this was the last time; that if he\r\nwere behind once more, by God, he would come and drag him out o\xe2\x80\x99 bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is sommit wrong in my make, your worshipful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Abel,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cespecially in the inside, whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as a\r\nclot afore I\xe2\x80\x99ve said my few scrags of prayers. Yes\xe2\x80\x94it came on as a\r\nstripling, just afore I\xe2\x80\x99d got man\xe2\x80\x99s wages, whereas I never enjoy my bed\r\nat all, for no sooner do I lie down than I be asleep, and afore I be\r\nawake I be up. I\xe2\x80\x99ve fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but\r\nwhat can I do? Now last night, afore I went to bed, I only had a\r\nscantling o\xe2\x80\x99 cheese and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow the waggons must\r\nstart at four, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not here, stand clear. I\xe2\x80\x99ll mortify thy\r\nflesh for thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me clear up my points, your worshipful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked me and he questioned me, and then \xe2\x80\x99a wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear my\r\npoints!\xe2\x80\x9d said Abel, to the yard in general. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I shall twitch like a\r\nmoment-hand all night to-night for fear o\xe2\x80\x99 him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe journey to be taken by the waggons next day was a long one into\r\nBlackmoor Vale, and at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock lanterns were moving about the\r\nyard. But Abel was missing. Before either of the other men could run to\r\nAbel\xe2\x80\x99s and warn him Henchard appeared in the garden doorway. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAbel Whittle? Not come after all I\xe2\x80\x99ve said? Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry out my word,\r\nby my blessed fathers\xe2\x80\x94nothing else will do him any good! I\xe2\x80\x99m going up\r\nthat way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard went off, entered Abel\xe2\x80\x99s house, a little cottage in Back\r\nStreet, the door of which was never locked because the inmates had\r\nnothing to lose. Reaching Whittle\xe2\x80\x99s bedside the corn-factor shouted a\r\nbass note so vigorously that Abel started up instantly, and beholding\r\nHenchard standing over him, was galvanized into spasmodic movements\r\nwhich had not much relation to getting on his clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of bed, sir, and off to the granary, or you leave my employ\r\nto-day! \xe2\x80\x99Tis to teach ye a lesson. March on; never mind your breeches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat, and managed to get\r\ninto his boots at the bottom of the stairs, while Henchard thrust his\r\nhat over his head. Whittle then trotted on down Back Street, Henchard\r\nwalking sternly behind.\r\n\r\nJust at this time Farfrae, who had been to Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s house to look for\r\nhim, came out of the back gate, and saw something white fluttering in\r\nthe morning gloom, which he soon perceived to be part of Abel\xe2\x80\x99s shirt\r\nthat showed below his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor maircy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what object\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, following Abel\r\ninto the yard, Henchard being some way in the rear by this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe see, Mr. Farfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d gibbered Abel with a resigned smile of terror,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che said he\xe2\x80\x99d mortify my flesh if so be I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get up sooner, and now\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a-doing on\xe2\x80\x99t! Ye see it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, Mr. Farfrae; things do\r\nhappen queer sometimes! Yes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as I\r\nbe, since he do command; but I shall kill myself afterwards; I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noutlive the disgrace, for the women-folk will be looking out of their\r\nwinders at my mortification all the way along, and laughing me to scorn\r\nas a man \xe2\x80\x99ithout breeches! You know how I feel such things, Maister\r\nFarfrae, and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me. Yes\xe2\x80\x94I shall do\r\nmyself harm\xe2\x80\x94I feel it coming on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet back home, and slip on your breeches, and come to wark like a man!\r\nIf ye go not, you\xe2\x80\x99ll ha\xe2\x80\x99e your death standing there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afeard I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t! Mr. Henchard said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care what Mr. Henchard said, nor anybody else! \xe2\x80\x99Tis simple\r\nfoolishness to do this. Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, hullo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, coming up behind. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s sending him\r\nback?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the men looked towards Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald. \xe2\x80\x9cI say this joke has been carried far enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t! Get up in the waggon, Whittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I am manager,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cHe either goes home, or I march\r\nout of this yard for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard looked at him with a face stern and red. But he paused for a\r\nmoment, and their eyes met. Donald went up to him, for he saw in\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s look that he began to regret this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald quietly, \xe2\x80\x9ca man o\xe2\x80\x99 your position should ken better,\r\nsir! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis not tyrannical!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to\r\nmake him remember!\xe2\x80\x9d He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae? You might have\r\nstopped till we were alone. Ah\xe2\x80\x94I know why! I\xe2\x80\x99ve told ye the secret o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy life\xe2\x80\x94fool that I was to do\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94and you take advantage of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgot it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae simply.\r\n\r\nHenchard looked on the ground, said nothing more, and turned away.\r\nDuring the day Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept\r\nAbel\xe2\x80\x99s old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter, which\r\nmade him less antagonistic to the corn-factor. But Henchard continued\r\nmoody and silent, and when one of the men inquired of him if some oats\r\nshould be hoisted to an upper floor or not, he said shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk Mr.\r\nFarfrae. He\xe2\x80\x99s master here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMorally he was; there could be no doubt of it. Henchard, who had\r\nhitherto been the most admired man in his circle, was the most admired\r\nno longer. One day the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover\r\nwanted an opinion of the value of their haystack, and sent a messenger\r\nto ask Mr. Farfrae to oblige them with one. The messenger, who was a\r\nchild, met in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut please will Mr. Farfrae come?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, with the\r\nfixed look of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do people always want Mr. Farfrae?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose because they like him so\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I see\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what they say\xe2\x80\x94hey? They like him because he\xe2\x80\x99s cleverer\r\nthan Mr. Henchard, and because he knows more; and, in short, Mr.\r\nHenchard can\xe2\x80\x99t hold a candle to him\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s just it, sir\xe2\x80\x94some of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s more? Of course there\xe2\x80\x99s more! What besides? Come, here\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsixpence for a fairing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And he\xe2\x80\x99s better tempered, and Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s a fool to him,\xe2\x80\x99 they say.\r\nAnd when some of the women were a-walking home they said, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndiment\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a chap o\xe2\x80\x99 wax\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s the best\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s the horse for my money,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays they. And they said, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s the most understanding man o\xe2\x80\x99 them two\r\nby long chalks. I wish he was the master instead of Henchard,\xe2\x80\x99 they\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll talk any nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard replied with covered gloom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can go now. And _I_ am coming to value the hay, d\xe2\x80\x99ye\r\nhear?\xe2\x80\x94I.\xe2\x80\x9d The boy departed, and Henchard murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cWish he were master\r\nhere, do they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went towards Durnover. On his way he overtook Farfrae. They walked\r\non together, Henchard looking mostly on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re no yoursel\xe2\x80\x99 the day?\xe2\x80\x9d Donald inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ye are a bit down\xe2\x80\x94surely ye are down? Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be\r\nangry about! \xe2\x80\x99Tis splendid stuff that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got from Blackmoor Vale. By\r\nthe by, the people in Durnover want their hay valued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am going there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Henchard did not reply Donald practised a piece of music _sotto\r\nvoce_, till, getting near the bereaved people\xe2\x80\x99s door, he stopped\r\nhimself with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, as their father is dead I won\xe2\x80\x99t go on with such as that. How could\r\nI forget?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you care so very much about hurting folks\xe2\x80\x99 feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nHenchard with a half sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do, I know\xe2\x80\x94especially mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry if I have hurt yours, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Donald, standing still,\r\nwith a second expression of the same sentiment in the regretfulness of\r\nhis face. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you say it\xe2\x80\x94think it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cloud lifted from Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s brow, and as Donald finished the\r\ncorn-merchant turned to him, regarding his breast rather than his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been hearing things that vexed me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas that made\r\nme short in my manner\xe2\x80\x94made me overlook what you really are. Now, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to go in here about this hay\xe2\x80\x94Farfrae, you can do it better\r\nthan I. They sent for \xe2\x80\x99ee, too. I have to attend a meeting of the Town\r\nCouncil at eleven, and \xe2\x80\x99tis drawing on for\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey parted thus in renewed friendship, Donald forbearing to ask\r\nHenchard for meanings that were not very plain to him. On Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart there was now again repose; and yet, whenever he thought of\r\nFarfrae, it was with a dim dread; and he often regretted that he had\r\ntold the young man his whole heart, and confided to him the secrets of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nOn this account Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s manner towards Farfrae insensibly became\r\nmore reserved. He was courteous\xe2\x80\x94too courteous\xe2\x80\x94and Farfrae was quite\r\nsurprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed\r\nitself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought\r\nundisciplined, if warm and sincere. The corn-factor seldom or never\r\nagain put his arm upon the young man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder so as to nearly weigh\r\nhim down with the pressure of mechanized friendship. He left off coming\r\nto Donald\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings and shouting into the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cHoy, Farfrae, boy,\r\ncome and have some dinner with us! Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit here in solitary\r\nconfinement!\xe2\x80\x9d But in the daily routine of their business there was\r\nlittle change.\r\n\r\nThus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested\r\nto the country at large in celebration of a national event that had\r\nrecently taken place.\r\n\r\nFor some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one\r\nday Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he\r\nwould have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few\r\nothers, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on\r\nthe day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might\r\ncharge admission at the rate of so much a head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave as many cloths as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard replied.\r\n\r\nWhen his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with\r\nemulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he\r\nthought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on\r\nthis holiday. But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as\r\nto give old-fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative.\r\nHowever, it was not too late; and on second thoughts he determined to\r\ntake upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some\r\namusements, if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his\r\nhands. To this they quite readily agreed, the majority being fine old\r\ncrusted characters who had a decided taste for living without worry.\r\n\r\nSo Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94such as should be worthy of the venerable town. As for Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle affair, Henchard nearly forgot it; except once now and then\r\nwhen, on it coming into his mind, he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cCharge admission\r\nat so much a head\xe2\x80\x94just like a Scotchman!\xe2\x80\x94who is going to pay anything a\r\nhead?\xe2\x80\x9d The diversions which the Mayor intended to provide were to be\r\nentirely free.\r\n\r\nHe had grown so dependent upon Donald that he could scarcely resist\r\ncalling him in to consult. But by sheer self-coercion he refrained. No,\r\nhe thought, Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned\r\nluminous way that in spite of himself he, Henchard, would sink to the\r\nposition of second fiddle, and only scrape harmonies to his manager\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nEverybody applauded the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed entertainment, especially when\r\nit became known that he meant to pay for it all himself.\r\n\r\nClose to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient\r\nsquare earthwork\xe2\x80\x94earthworks square and not square, were as common as\r\nblackberries hereabout\xe2\x80\x94a spot whereon the Casterbridge people usually\r\nheld any kind of merry-making, meeting, or sheep-fair that required\r\nmore space than the streets would afford. On one side it sloped to the\r\nriver Froom, and from any point a view was obtained of the country\r\nround for many miles. This pleasant upland was to be the scene of\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s exploit.\r\n\r\nHe advertised about the town, in long posters of a pink colour, that\r\ngames of all sorts would take place here; and set to work a little\r\nbattalion of men under his own eye. They erected greasy-poles for\r\nclimbing, with smoked hams and local cheeses at the top. They placed\r\nhurdles in rows for jumping over; across the river they laid a slippery\r\npole, with a live pig of the neighbourhood tied at the other end, to\r\nbecome the property of the man who could walk over and get it. There\r\nwere also provided wheelbarrows for racing, donkeys for the same, a\r\nstage for boxing, wrestling, and drawing blood generally; sacks for\r\njumping in. Moreover, not forgetting his principles, Henchard provided\r\na mammoth tea, of which everybody who lived in the borough was invited\r\nto partake without payment. The tables were laid parallel with the\r\ninner slope of the rampart, and awnings were stretched overhead.\r\n\r\nPassing to and fro the Mayor beheld the unattractive exterior of\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s erection in the West Walk, rick-cloths of different sizes and\r\ncolours being hung up to the arching trees without any regard to\r\nappearance. He was easy in his mind now, for his own preparations far\r\ntranscended these.\r\n\r\nThe morning came. The sky, which had been remarkably clear down to\r\nwithin a day or two, was overcast, and the weather threatening, the\r\nwind having an unmistakable hint of water in it. Henchard wished he had\r\nnot been quite so sure about the continuance of a fair season. But it\r\nwas too late to modify or postpone, and the proceedings went on. At\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock the rain began to fall, small and steady, commencing and\r\nincreasing so insensibly that it was difficult to state exactly when\r\ndry weather ended or wet established itself. In an hour the slight\r\nmoisture resolved itself into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven,\r\nin torrents to which no end could be prognosticated.\r\n\r\nA number of people had heroically gathered in the field but by three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock Henchard discerned that his project was doomed to end in\r\nfailure. The hams at the top of the poles dripped watered smoke in the\r\nform of a brown liquor, the pig shivered in the wind, the grain of the\r\ndeal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths, for the awning\r\nallowed the rain to drift under at its will, and to enclose the sides\r\nat this hour seemed a useless undertaking. The landscape over the river\r\ndisappeared; the wind played on the tent-cords in \xc3\x86olian\r\nimprovisations, and at length rose to such a pitch that the whole\r\nerection slanted to the ground those who had taken shelter within it\r\nhaving to crawl out on their hands and knees.\r\n\r\nBut towards six the storm abated, and a drier breeze shook the moisture\r\nfrom the grass bents. It seemed possible to carry out the programme\r\nafter all. The awning was set up again; the band was called out from\r\nits shelter, and ordered to begin, and where the tables had stood a\r\nplace was cleared for dancing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are the folk?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, after the lapse of\r\nhalf-an-hour, during which time only two men and a woman had stood up\r\nto dance. \xe2\x80\x9cThe shops are all shut. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are at Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s affair in the West Walk,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a Councilman\r\nwho stood in the field with the Mayor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few, I suppose. But where are the body o\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll out of doors are there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the more fools they!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard walked away moodily. One or two young fellows gallantly came\r\nto climb the poles, to save the hams from being wasted; but as there\r\nwere no spectators, and the whole scene presented the most melancholy\r\nappearance Henchard gave orders that the proceedings were to be\r\nsuspended, and the entertainment closed, the food to be distributed\r\namong the poor people of the town. In a short time nothing was left in\r\nthe field but a few hurdles, the tents, and the poles.\r\n\r\nHenchard returned to his house, had tea with his wife and daughter, and\r\nthen walked out. It was now dusk. He soon saw that the tendency of all\r\npromenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and eventually\r\nproceeded thither himself. The notes of a stringed band came from the\r\nenclosure that Farfrae had erected\xe2\x80\x94the pavilion as he called it\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen the Mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been\r\ningeniously constructed without poles or ropes. The densest point of\r\nthe avenue of sycamores had been selected, where the boughs made a\r\nclosely interlaced vault overhead; to these boughs the canvas had been\r\nhung, and a barrel roof was the result. The end towards the wind was\r\nenclosed, the other end was open. Henchard went round and saw the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nIn form it was like the nave of a cathedral with one gable removed, but\r\nthe scene within was anything but devotional. A reel or fling of some\r\nsort was in progress; and the usually sedate Farfrae was in the midst\r\nof the other dancers in the costume of a wild Highlander, flinging\r\nhimself about and spinning to the tune. For a moment Henchard could not\r\nhelp laughing. Then he perceived the immense admiration for the\r\nScotchman that revealed itself in the women\xe2\x80\x99s faces; and when this\r\nexhibition was over, and a new dance proposed, and Donald had\r\ndisappeared for a time to return in his natural garments, he had an\r\nunlimited choice of partners, every girl being in a coming-on\r\ndisposition towards one who so thoroughly understood the poetry of\r\nmotion as he.\r\n\r\nAll the town crowded to the Walk, such a delightful idea of a ballroom\r\nnever having occurred to the inhabitants before. Among the rest of the\r\nonlookers were Elizabeth and her mother\xe2\x80\x94the former thoughtful yet much\r\ninterested, her eyes beaming with a longing lingering light, as if\r\nNature had been advised by Correggio in their creation. The dancing\r\nprogressed with unabated spirit, and Henchard walked and waited till\r\nhis wife should be disposed to go home. He did not care to keep in the\r\nlight, and when he went into the dark it was worse, for there he heard\r\nremarks of a kind which were becoming too frequent:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s rejoicings couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say good morning to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\none. \xe2\x80\x9cA man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to\r\nthat bleak place to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other answered that people said it was not only in such things as\r\nthose that the Mayor was wanting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere would his business be if it\r\nwere not for this young fellow? \xe2\x80\x99Twas verily Fortune sent him to\r\nHenchard. His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr. Farfrae came.\r\nHe used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like\r\ngarden-palings, measure his ricks by stretching with his arms, weigh\r\nhis trusses by a lift, judge his hay by a chaw, and settle the price\r\nwith a curse. But now this accomplished young man does it all by\r\nciphering and mensuration. Then the wheat\xe2\x80\x94that sometimes used to taste\r\nso strong o\xe2\x80\x99 mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell\r\nthe breed\xe2\x80\x94Farfrae has a plan for purifying, so that nobody would dream\r\nthe smallest four-legged beast had walked over it once. O yes,\r\neverybody is full of him, and the care Mr. Henchard has to keep him, to\r\nbe sure!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded this gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he won\xe2\x80\x99t do it for long, good-now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard to himself behind the tree. \xe2\x80\x9cOr if he do, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nhoneycombed clean out of all the character and standing that he\xe2\x80\x99s built\r\nup in these eighteen year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to the dancing pavilion. Farfrae was footing a quaint\r\nlittle dance with Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94an old country thing, the only one she\r\nknew, and though he considerately toned down his movements to suit her\r\ndemurer gait, the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of\r\nhis boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander. The tune had\r\nenticed her into it; being a tune of a busy, vaulting, leaping\r\nsort\xe2\x80\x94some low notes on the silver string of each fiddle, then a\r\nskipping on the small, like running up and down ladders\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMiss M\xe2\x80\x99Leod of\r\nAyr\xe2\x80\x9d was its name, so Mr. Farfrae had said, and that it was very\r\npopular in his own country.\r\n\r\nIt was soon over, and the girl looked at Henchard for approval; but he\r\ndid not give it. He seemed not to see her. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Farfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, like one whose mind was elsewhere, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Port-Bredy Great\r\nMarket to-morrow myself. You can stay and put things right in your\r\nclothes-box, and recover strength to your knees after your vagaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHe planted on Donald an antagonistic glare that had begun as a smile.\r\n\r\nSome other townsmen came up, and Donald drew aside. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this,\r\nHenchard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alderman Tubber, applying his thumb to the corn-factor\r\nlike a cheese-taster. \xe2\x80\x9cAn opposition randy to yours, eh? Jack\xe2\x80\x99s as good\r\nas his master, eh? Cut ye out quite, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Mr. Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, another goodnatured friend,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhere you made the mistake was in going so far afield. You should have\r\ntaken a leaf out of his book, and have had your sports in a sheltered\r\nplace like this. But you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it, you see; and he did, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99s beat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll be top-sawyer soon of you two, and carry all afore him,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\njocular Mr. Tubber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t be that, because he\xe2\x80\x99s shortly\r\ngoing to leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked towards Donald, who had come near. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s time as my manager is drawing to a close\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Farfrae?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man, who could now read the lines and folds of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrongly-traced face as if they were clear verbal inscriptions, quietly\r\nassented; and when people deplored the fact, and asked why it was, he\r\nsimply replied that Mr. Henchard no longer required his help.\r\n\r\nHenchard went home, apparently satisfied. But in the morning, when his\r\njealous temper had passed away, his heart sank within him at what he\r\nhad said and done. He was the more disturbed when he found that this\r\ntime Farfrae was determined to take him at his word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane had perceived from Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s manner that in assenting\r\nto dance she had made a mistake of some kind. In her simplicity she did\r\nnot know what it was till a hint from a nodding acquaintance\r\nenlightened her. As the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s stepdaughter, she learnt, she had not\r\nbeen quite in her place in treading a measure amid such a mixed throng\r\nas filled the dancing pavilion.\r\n\r\nThereupon her ears, cheeks, and chin glowed like live coals at the\r\ndawning of the idea that her tastes were not good enough for her\r\nposition, and would bring her into disgrace.\r\n\r\nThis made her very miserable, and she looked about for her mother; but\r\nMrs. Henchard, who had less idea of conventionality than Elizabeth\r\nherself, had gone away, leaving her daughter to return at her own\r\npleasure. The latter moved on into the dark dense old avenues, or\r\nrather vaults of living woodwork, which ran along the town boundary,\r\nand stood reflecting.\r\n\r\nA man followed in a few minutes, and her face being to-wards the shine\r\nfrom the tent he recognized her. It was Farfrae\xe2\x80\x94just come from the\r\ndialogue with Henchard which had signified his dismissal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s you, Miss Newson?\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for ye everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, overcoming a sadness imparted by the estrangement with the\r\ncorn-merchant. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I walk on with you as far as your street-corner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought there might be something wrong in this, but did not utter\r\nany objection. So together they went on, first down the West Walk, and\r\nthen into the Bowling Walk, till Farfrae said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like that I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to leave you soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94as a mere matter of business\xe2\x80\x94nothing more. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll not concern\r\nourselves about it\xe2\x80\x94it is for the best. I hoped to have another dance\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said she could not dance\xe2\x80\x94in any proper way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but you do! It\xe2\x80\x99s the feeling for it rather than the learning of\r\nsteps that makes pleasant dancers.... I fear I offended your father by\r\ngetting up this! And now, perhaps, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go to another part o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe warrld altogether!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed such a melancholy prospect that Elizabeth-Jane breathed a\r\nsigh\xe2\x80\x94letting it off in fragments that he might not hear her. But\r\ndarkness makes people truthful, and the Scotchman went on\r\nimpulsively\xe2\x80\x94perhaps he had heard her after all:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was richer, Miss Newson; and your stepfather had not been\r\noffended, I would ask you something in a short time\xe2\x80\x94yes, I would ask\r\nyou to-night. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat he would have asked her he did not say, and instead of encouraging\r\nhim she remained incompetently silent. Thus afraid one of another they\r\ncontinued their promenade along the walls till they got near the bottom\r\nof the Bowling Walk; twenty steps further and the trees would end, and\r\nthe street-corner and lamps appear. In consciousness of this they\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never found out who it was that sent us to Durnover granary on a\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x99s errand that day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald, in his undulating tones. \xe2\x80\x9cDid ye\r\never know yourself, Miss Newson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why they did it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor fun, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was not for fun. It might have been that they thought they\r\nwould like us to stay waiting there, talking to one another? Ay, well!\r\nI hope you Casterbridge folk will not forget me if I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nat all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had got into the lamplight. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll think over that,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDonald Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll not come up to your door; but part from you\r\nhere; lest it make your father more angry still.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey parted, Farfrae returning into the dark Bowling Walk, and\r\nElizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness of what\r\nshe was doing she started running with all her might till she reached\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s door. \xe2\x80\x9cO dear me\xe2\x80\x94what am I at?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, as she pulled\r\nup breathless.\r\n\r\nIndoors she fell to conjecturing the meaning of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s enigmatic\r\nwords about not daring to ask her what he fain would. Elizabeth, that\r\nsilent observing woman, had long noted how he was rising in favour\r\namong the townspeople; and knowing Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s nature now she had feared\r\nthat Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s days as manager were numbered, so that the announcement\r\ngave her little surprise. Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge\r\ndespite his words and her father\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal? His occult breathings to\r\nher might be solvable by his course in that respect.\r\n\r\nThe next day was windy\xe2\x80\x94so windy that walking in the garden she picked\r\nup a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting, which had flown over the wall from the office. The useless\r\nscrap she took indoors, and began to copy the calligraphy, which she\r\nmuch admired. The letter began \xe2\x80\x9cDear Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and presently writing on a\r\nloose slip \xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth-Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d she laid the latter over \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d making the\r\nphrase \xe2\x80\x9cDear Elizabeth-Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d When she saw the effect a quick red ran\r\nup her face and warmed her through, though nobody was there to see what\r\nshe had done. She quickly tore up the slip, and threw it away. After\r\nthis she grew cool and laughed at herself, walked about the room, and\r\nlaughed again; not joyfully, but distressfully rather.\r\n\r\nIt was quickly known in Casterbridge that Farfrae and Henchard had\r\ndecided to dispense with each other. Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to know\r\nif Farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed\r\nher, for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause. At length\r\nthe news reached her that he was not going to leave the place. A man\r\nfollowing the same trade as Henchard, but on a very small scale, had\r\nsold his business to Farfrae, who was forthwith about to start as corn\r\nand hay merchant on his own account.\r\n\r\nHer heart fluttered when she heard of this step of Donald\xe2\x80\x99s, proving\r\nthat he meant to remain; and yet, would a man who cared one little bit\r\nfor her have endangered his suit by setting up a business in opposition\r\nto Mr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s? Surely not; and it must have been a passing impulse\r\nonly which had led him to address her so softly.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem whether her appearance on the evening of the dance\r\nwere such as to inspire a fleeting love at first sight, she dressed\r\nherself up exactly as she had dressed then\xe2\x80\x94the muslin, the spencer, the\r\nsandals, the parasol\xe2\x80\x94and looked in the mirror. The picture glassed back\r\nwas in her opinion, precisely of such a kind as to inspire that\r\nfleeting regard, and no more\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cjust enough to make him silly, and not\r\nenough to keep him so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said luminously; and Elizabeth thought, in\r\na much lower key, that by this time he had discovered how plain and\r\nhomely was the informing spirit of that pretty outside.\r\n\r\nHence, when she felt her heart going out to him, she would say to\r\nherself with a mock pleasantry that carried an ache with it, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94such dreams are not for you!\xe2\x80\x9d She tried to prevent\r\nherself from seeing him, and thinking of him; succeeding fairly well in\r\nthe former attempt, in the latter not so completely.\r\n\r\nHenchard, who had been hurt at finding that Farfrae did not mean to put\r\nup with his temper any longer, was incensed beyond measure when he\r\nlearnt what the young man had done as an alternative. It was in the\r\ntown-hall, after a council meeting, that he first became aware of\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s _coup_ for establishing himself independently in the town;\r\nand his voice might have been heard as far as the town-pump expressing\r\nhis feelings to his fellow councilmen. These tones showed that, though\r\nunder a long reign of self-control he had become Mayor and churchwarden\r\nand what not, there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath\r\nthe rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon\r\nFair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a friend of his\xe2\x80\x94or if we are not,\r\nwhat are we? \xe2\x80\x99Od send, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been his friend, who has, I should\r\nlike to know? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he come here without a sound shoe to his voot?\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I keep him here\xe2\x80\x94help him to a living? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I help him to\r\nmoney, or whatever he wanted? I stuck out for no terms\xe2\x80\x94I said \xe2\x80\x98Name\r\nyour own price.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99d have shared my last crust with that young fellow\r\nat one time, I liked him so well. And now he\xe2\x80\x99s defied me! But damn him,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have a tussle with him now\xe2\x80\x94at fair buying and selling, mind\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nfair buying and selling! And if I can\xe2\x80\x99t overbid such a stripling as he,\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99m not wo\xe2\x80\x99th a varden! We\xe2\x80\x99ll show that we know our business as\r\nwell as one here and there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis friends of the Corporation did not specially respond. Henchard was\r\nless popular now than he had been when nearly two years before, they\r\nhad voted him to the chief magistracy on account of his amazing energy.\r\nWhile they had collectively profited by this quality of the\r\ncorn-factor\xe2\x80\x99s they had been made to wince individually on more than one\r\noccasion. So he went out of the hall and down the street alone.\r\n\r\nReaching home he seemed to recollect something with a sour\r\nsatisfaction. He called Elizabeth-Jane. Seeing how he looked when she\r\nentered she appeared alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to find fault with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, observing her concern. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I\r\nwant to caution you, my dear. That man, Farfrae\xe2\x80\x94it is about him. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen him talking to you two or three times\xe2\x80\x94he danced with \xe2\x80\x99ee at the\r\nrejoicings, and came home with \xe2\x80\x99ee. Now, now, no blame to you. But just\r\nharken: Have you made him any foolish promise? Gone the least bit\r\nbeyond sniff and snaff at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I have promised him nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. All\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well. I particularly wish you not to see\r\nhim again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for a moment, and then said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you much wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do. He\xe2\x80\x99s an enemy to our house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone he sat down, and wrote in a heavy hand to Farfrae\r\nthus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x94I make request that henceforth you and my stepdaughter be as\r\nstrangers to each other. She on her part has promised to welcome no\r\nmore addresses from you; and I trust, therefore, you will not attempt\r\nto force them upon her.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. HENCHARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would almost have supposed Henchard to have had policy to see that\r\nno better _modus vivendi_ could be arrived at with Farfrae than by\r\nencouraging him to become his son-in-law. But such a scheme for buying\r\nover a rival had nothing to recommend it to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s headstrong\r\nfaculties. With all domestic _finesse_ of that kind he was hopelessly\r\nat variance. Loving a man or hating him, his diplomacy was as\r\nwrongheaded as a buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s; and his wife had not ventured to suggest\r\nthe course which she, for many reasons, would have welcomed gladly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Donald Farfrae had opened the gates of commerce on his own\r\naccount at a spot on Durnover Hill\xe2\x80\x94as far as possible from Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstores, and with every intention of keeping clear of his former friend\r\nand employer\xe2\x80\x99s customers. There was, it seemed to the younger man, room\r\nfor both of them and to spare. The town was small, but the corn and\r\nhay-trade was proportionately large, and with his native sagacity he\r\nsaw opportunity for a share of it.\r\n\r\nSo determined was he to do nothing which should seem like\r\ntrade-antagonism to the Mayor that he refused his first customer\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlarge farmer of good repute\xe2\x80\x94because Henchard and this man had dealt\r\ntogether within the preceding three months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was once my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to take\r\nbusiness from him. I am sorry to disappoint you, but I cannot hurt the\r\ntrade of a man who\xe2\x80\x99s been so kind to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of this praiseworthy course the Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s trade increased.\r\nWhether it were that his northern energy was an overmastering force\r\namong the easy-going Wessex worthies, or whether it was sheer luck, the\r\nfact remained that whatever he touched he prospered in. Like Jacob in\r\nPadan-Aram, he would no sooner humbly limit himself to the\r\nringstraked-and-spotted exceptions of trade than the\r\nringstraked-and-spotted would multiply and prevail.\r\n\r\nBut most probably luck had little to do with it. Character is Fate,\r\nsaid Novalis, and Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s character was just the reverse of\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s, who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been\r\ndescribed\xe2\x80\x94as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar\r\nmen without light to guide him on a better way.\r\n\r\nFarfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to\r\nElizabeth-Jane. His acts of that kind had been so slight that the\r\nrequest was almost superfluous. Yet he had felt a considerable interest\r\nin her, and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well\r\nto enact no Romeo part just then\xe2\x80\x94for the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s sake no less than\r\nhis own. Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down.\r\n\r\nA time came when, avoid collision with his former friend as he might,\r\nFarfrae was compelled, in sheer self-defence, to close with Henchard in\r\nmortal commercial combat. He could no longer parry the fierce attacks\r\nof the latter by simple avoidance. As soon as their war of prices began\r\neverybody was interested, and some few guessed the end. It was, in some\r\ndegree, Northern insight matched against Southern doggedness\xe2\x80\x94the dirk\r\nagainst the cudgel\xe2\x80\x94and Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s weapon was one which, if it did not\r\ndeal ruin at the first or second stroke, left him afterwards well-nigh\r\nat his antagonist\xe2\x80\x99s mercy.\r\n\r\nAlmost every Saturday they encountered each other amid the crowd of\r\nfarmers which thronged about the market-place in the weekly course of\r\ntheir business. Donald was always ready, and even anxious, to say a few\r\nfriendly words, but the Mayor invariably gazed stormfully past him,\r\nlike one who had endured and lost on his account, and could in no sense\r\nforgive the wrong; nor did Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s snubbed manner of perplexity at\r\nall appease him. The large farmers, corn-merchants, millers,\r\nauctioneers, and others had each an official stall in the corn-market\r\nroom, with their names painted thereon; and when to the familiar series\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cHenchard,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEverdene,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShiner,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDarton,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on, was added one\r\ninscribed \xe2\x80\x9cFarfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d in staring new letters, Henchard was stung into\r\nbitterness; like Bellerophon, he wandered away from the crowd, cankered\r\nin soul.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Donald Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s name was seldom mentioned in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. If at breakfast or dinner Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mother inadvertently\r\nalluded to her favourite\xe2\x80\x99s movements, the girl would implore her by a\r\nlook to be silent; and her husband would say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94are you, too, my\r\nenemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nThere came a shock which had been foreseen for some time by Elizabeth,\r\nas the box passenger foresees the approaching jerk from some channel\r\nacross the highway.\r\n\r\nHer mother was ill\xe2\x80\x94too unwell to leave her room. Henchard, who treated\r\nher kindly, except in moments of irritation, sent at once for the\r\nrichest, busiest doctor, whom he supposed to be the best. Bedtime came,\r\nand they burnt a light all night. In a day or two she rallied.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, who had been staying up, did not appear at breakfast on the\r\nsecond morning, and Henchard sat down alone. He was startled to see a\r\nletter for him from Jersey in a writing he knew too well, and had\r\nexpected least to behold again. He took it up in his hands and looked\r\nat it as at a picture, a vision, a vista of past enactments; and then\r\nhe read it as an unimportant finale to conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe writer said that she at length perceived how impossible it would be\r\nfor any further communications to proceed between them now that his\r\nre-marriage had taken place. That such reunion had been the only\r\nstraightforward course open to him she was bound to admit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn calm reflection, therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI quite forgive you for\r\nlanding me in such a dilemma, remembering that you concealed nothing\r\nbefore our ill-advised acquaintance; and that you really did set before\r\nme in your grim way the fact of there being a certain risk in intimacy\r\nwith you, slight as it seemed to be after fifteen or sixteen years of\r\nsilence on your wife\xe2\x80\x99s part. I thus look upon the whole as a misfortune\r\nof mine, and not a fault of yours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that, Michael, I must ask you to overlook those letters with which\r\nI pestered you day after day in the heat of my feelings. They were\r\nwritten whilst I thought your conduct to me cruel; but now I know more\r\nparticulars of the position you were in I see how inconsiderate my\r\nreproaches were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you will, I am sure, perceive that the one condition which will\r\nmake any future happiness possible for me is that the past connection\r\nbetween our lives be kept secret outside this isle. Speak of it I know\r\nyou will not; and I can trust you not to write of it. One safe-guard\r\nmore remains to be mentioned\xe2\x80\x94that no writings of mine, or trifling\r\narticles belonging to me, should be left in your possession through\r\nneglect or forgetfulness. To this end may I request you to return to me\r\nany such you may have, particularly the letters written in the first\r\nabandonment of feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the handsome sum you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound I\r\nheartily thank you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now on my way to Bristol, to see my only relative. She is rich,\r\nand I hope will do something for me. I shall return through\r\nCasterbridge and Budmouth, where I shall take the packet-boat. Can you\r\nmeet me with the letters and other trifles? I shall be in the coach\r\nwhich changes horses at the Antelope Hotel at half-past five Wednesday\r\nevening; I shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre, and thus\r\nmay easily be found. I should prefer this plan of receiving them to\r\nhaving them sent.\xe2\x80\x94I remain still, yours; ever,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLUCETTA\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard breathed heavily. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing\xe2\x80\x94better you had not known me!\r\nUpon my heart and soul, if ever I should be left in a position to carry\r\nout that marriage with thee, I _ought_ to do it\xe2\x80\x94I ought to do it,\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contingency that he had in his mind was, of course, the death of\r\nMrs. Henchard.\r\n\r\nAs requested, he sealed up Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s letters, and put the parcel aside\r\ntill the day she had appointed; this plan of returning them by hand\r\nbeing apparently a little _ruse_ of the young lady for exchanging a\r\nword or two with him on past times. He would have preferred not to see\r\nher; but deeming that there could be no great harm in acquiescing thus\r\nfar, he went at dusk and stood opposite the coach-office.\r\n\r\nThe evening was chilly, and the coach was late. Henchard crossed over\r\nto it while the horses were being changed; but there was no Lucetta\r\ninside or out. Concluding that something had happened to modify her\r\narrangements he gave the matter up and went home, not without a sense\r\nof relief. Meanwhile Mrs. Henchard was weakening visibly. She could not\r\ngo out of doors any more. One day, after much thinking which seemed to\r\ndistress her, she said she wanted to write something. A desk was put\r\nupon her bed with pen and paper, and at her request she was left alone.\r\nShe remained writing for a short time, folded her paper carefully,\r\ncalled Elizabeth-Jane to bring a taper and wax, and then, still\r\nrefusing assistance, sealed up the sheet, directed it, and locked it in\r\nher desk. She had directed it in these words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mr. Michael Henchard. Not to be opened till Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwedding-day._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter sat up with her mother to the utmost of her strength night\r\nafter night. To learn to take the universe seriously there is no\r\nquicker way than to watch\xe2\x80\x94to be a \xe2\x80\x9cwaker,\xe2\x80\x9d as the country-people call\r\nit. Between the hours at which the last toss-pot went by and the first\r\nsparrow shook himself, the silence in Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94barring the rare\r\nsound of the watchman\xe2\x80\x94was broken in Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s ear only by the\r\ntime-piece in the bedroom ticking frantically against the clock on the\r\nstairs; ticking harder and harder till it seemed to clang like a gong;\r\nand all this while the subtle-souled girl asking herself why she was\r\nborn, why sitting in a room, and blinking at the candle; why things\r\naround her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other\r\npossible shape. Why they stared at her so helplessly, as if waiting for\r\nthe touch of some wand that should release them from terrestrial\r\nconstraint; what that chaos called consciousness, which spun in her at\r\nthis moment like a top, tended to, and began in. Her eyes fell\r\ntogether; she was awake, yet she was asleep.\r\n\r\nA word from her mother roused her. Without preface, and as the\r\ncontinuation of a scene already progressing in her mind, Mrs. Henchard\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember the note sent to you and Mr. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x94asking you to\r\nmeet some one in Durnover Barton\xe2\x80\x94and that you thought it was a trick to\r\nmake fools of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not to make fools of you\xe2\x80\x94it was done to bring you together.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas I did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94wanted you to marry Mr. Farfrae.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO mother!\xe2\x80\x9d Elizabeth-Jane bent down her head so much that she looked\r\nquite into her own lap. But as her mother did not go on, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had a reason. \xe2\x80\x99Twill out one day. I wish it could have been in\r\nmy time! But there\xe2\x80\x94nothing is as you wish it! Henchard hates him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll be friends again,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d After this her mother was silent, and\r\ndozed; and she spoke on the subject no more.\r\n\r\nSome little time later on Farfrae was passing Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s house on a\r\nSunday morning, when he observed that the blinds were all down. He rang\r\nthe bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a small\r\none; and then he was informed that Mrs. Henchard was dead\xe2\x80\x94just\r\ndead\xe2\x80\x94that very hour.\r\n\r\nAt the town-pump there were gathered when he passed a few old\r\ninhabitants, who came there for water whenever they had, as at present,\r\nspare time to fetch it, because it was purer from that original fount\r\nthan from their own wells. Mrs. Cuxsom, who had been standing there for\r\nan indefinite time with her pitcher, was describing the incidents of\r\nMrs. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s death, as she had learnt them from the nurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she was white as marble-stone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cuxsom. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd likewise\r\nsuch a thoughtful woman, too\xe2\x80\x94ah, poor soul\xe2\x80\x94that a\xe2\x80\x99 minded every little\r\nthing that wanted tending. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98when I\xe2\x80\x99m gone, and my last\r\nbreath\xe2\x80\x99s blowed, look in the top drawer o\xe2\x80\x99 the chest in the back room\r\nby the window, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find all my coffin clothes, a piece of\r\nflannel\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s to put under me, and the little piece is to put under my\r\nhead; and my new stockings for my feet\xe2\x80\x94they are folded alongside, and\r\nall my other things. And there\xe2\x80\x99s four ounce pennies, the heaviest I\r\ncould find, a-tied up in bits of linen, for weights\xe2\x80\x94two for my right\r\neye and two for my left,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98And when you\xe2\x80\x99ve used \xe2\x80\x99em, and my\r\neyes don\xe2\x80\x99t open no more, bury the pennies, good souls and don\xe2\x80\x99t ye go\r\nspending \xe2\x80\x99em, for I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. And open the windows as soon as\r\nI am carried out, and make it as cheerful as you can for\r\nElizabeth-Jane.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and Martha did it, and buried the ounce pennies in the garden.\r\nBut if ye\xe2\x80\x99ll believe words, that man, Christopher Coney, went and dug\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em up, and spent \xe2\x80\x99em at the Three Mariners. \xe2\x80\x98Faith,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nshould death rob life o\xe2\x80\x99 fourpence? Death\xe2\x80\x99s not of such good report\r\nthat we should respect \xe2\x80\x99en to that extent,\xe2\x80\x99 says he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas a cannibal deed!\xe2\x80\x9d deprecated her listeners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad, then I won\xe2\x80\x99t quite ha\xe2\x80\x99e it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Solomon Longways. \xe2\x80\x9cI say it\r\nto-day, and \xe2\x80\x99tis a Sunday morning, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak wrongfully for\r\na zilver zixpence at such a time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see noo harm in it. To\r\nrespect the dead is sound doxology; and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell\r\nskellintons\xe2\x80\x94leastwise respectable skellintons\xe2\x80\x94to be varnished for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99natomies, except I were out o\xe2\x80\x99 work. But money is scarce, and throats\r\nget dry. Why _should_ death rob life o\xe2\x80\x99 fourpence? I say there was no\r\ntreason in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, poor soul; she\xe2\x80\x99s helpless to hinder that or anything now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Mother Cuxsom. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all her shining keys will be took from\r\nher, and her cupboards opened; and little things a\xe2\x80\x99 didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish seen,\r\nanybody will see; and her wishes and ways will all be as nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nHenchard and Elizabeth sat conversing by the fire. It was three weeks\r\nafter Mrs. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, the candles were not lighted, and a\r\nrestless, acrobatic flame, poised on a coal, called from the shady\r\nwalls the smiles of all shapes that could respond\xe2\x80\x94the old pier-glass,\r\nwith gilt columns and huge entablature, the picture-frames, sundry\r\nknobs and handles, and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband\r\nbell-pull on either side of the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth, do you think much of old times?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; often,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you put in your pictures of \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother and father\xe2\x80\x94nobody else hardly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when\r\nElizabeth-Jane spoke of Richard Newson as \xe2\x80\x9cfather.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am out of\r\nall that, am I not?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.... \xe2\x80\x9cWas Newson a kind father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which\r\ngradually modulated into something softer. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I had been your\r\nreal father?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you have cared for me as much as you\r\ncared for Richard Newson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can think of no other as my\r\nfather, except my father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s wife was dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper\r\nFarfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth-Jane by ignorance. It seemed to him\r\nthat only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the\r\ngirl. His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to\r\nher and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit\r\nstill. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her\r\nchair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer\r\nrestrain his impulse. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did your mother tell you about me\xe2\x80\x94my\r\nhistory?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you were related by marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe should have told more\xe2\x80\x94before you knew me! Then my task would not\r\nhave been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father,\r\nand not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents\r\nfrom owning this to you while both of \xe2\x80\x99em were alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe back of Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s head remained still, and her shoulders did not\r\ndenote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather\r\nhave your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \xe2\x80\x99tis that I\r\nhate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young. What you\r\nsaw was our second marriage. Your mother was too honest. We had thought\r\neach other dead\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94Newson became her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth. As\r\nfar as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing; but\r\nhe showed a respect for the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s sex and years worthy of a\r\nbetter man.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone on to give details which a whole series of slight and\r\nunregarded incidents in her past life strangely corroborated; when, in\r\nshort, she believed his story to be true, she became greatly agitated,\r\nand turning round to the table flung her face upon it weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t cry!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, with vehement pathos, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbear it, I won\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. I am your father; why should you cry? Am I so\r\ndreadful, so hateful to \xe2\x80\x99ee? Don\xe2\x80\x99t take against me, Elizabeth-Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncried, grasping her wet hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take against me\xe2\x80\x94though I was a\r\ndrinking man once, and used your mother roughly\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll be kinder to you\r\nthan _he_ was! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything, if you will only look upon me as your\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to stand up and comfort him trustfully; but she could not;\r\nshe was troubled at his presence, like the brethren at the avowal of\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to come to me all of a sudden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard in\r\njerks, and moving like a great tree in a wind. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Elizabeth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go away and not see you till to-morrow, or when you like, and then\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show \xe2\x80\x99ee papers to prove my words. There, I am gone, and won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndisturb you any more.... \xe2\x80\x99Twas I that chose your name, my daughter;\r\nyour mother wanted it Susan. There, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget \xe2\x80\x99twas I gave you your\r\nname!\xe2\x80\x9d He went out at the door and shut her softly in, and she heard\r\nhim go away into the garden. But he had not done. Before she had moved,\r\nor in any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure, he\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more, Elizabeth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll take my surname now\xe2\x80\x94hey?\r\nYour mother was against it, but it will be much more pleasant to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis legally yours, you know. But nobody need know that. You shall take\r\nit as if by choice. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to my lawyer\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the law of it\r\nexactly; but will you do this\xe2\x80\x94let me put a few lines into the newspaper\r\nthat such is to be your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is my name I must have it, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well; usage is everything in these matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why mother didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, some whim of the poor soul\xe2\x80\x99s. Now get a bit of paper and draw up a\r\nparagraph as I shall tell you. But let\xe2\x80\x99s have a light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see by the firelight,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe got a piece of paper, and bending over the fender wrote at his\r\ndictation words which he had evidently got by heart from some\r\nadvertisement or other\xe2\x80\x94words to the effect that she, the writer,\r\nhitherto known as Elizabeth-Jane Newson, was going to call herself\r\nElizabeth-Jane Henchard forthwith. It was done, and fastened up, and\r\ndirected to the office of the _Casterbridge Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, with the blaze of satisfaction that he always\r\nemitted when he had carried his point\xe2\x80\x94though tenderness softened it\r\nthis time\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go upstairs and hunt for some documents that will prove\r\nit all to you. But I won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you with them till to-morrow.\r\nGood-night, my Elizabeth-Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gone before the bewildered girl could realize what it all meant,\r\nor adjust her filial sense to the new center of gravity. She was\r\nthankful that he had left her to herself for the evening, and sat down\r\nover the fire. Here she remained in silence, and wept\xe2\x80\x94not for her\r\nmother now, but for the genial sailor Richard Newson, to whom she\r\nseemed doing a wrong.\r\n\r\nHenchard in the meantime had gone upstairs. Papers of a domestic nature\r\nhe kept in a drawer in his bedroom, and this he unlocked. Before\r\nturning them over he leant back and indulged in reposeful thought.\r\nElizabeth was his at last and she was a girl of such good sense and\r\nkind heart that she would be sure to like him. He was the kind of man\r\nto whom some human object for pouring out his heart upon\xe2\x80\x94were it\r\nemotive or were it choleric\xe2\x80\x94was almost a necessity. The craving for his\r\nheart for the re-establishment of this tenderest human tie had been\r\ngreat during his wife\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, and now he had submitted to its\r\nmastery without reluctance and without fear. He bent over the drawer\r\nagain, and proceeded in his search.\r\n\r\nAmong the other papers had been placed the contents of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlittle desk, the keys of which had been handed to him at her request.\r\nHere was the letter addressed to him with the restriction, \xe2\x80\x9c_Not to be\r\nopened till Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-day_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Henchard, though more patient than her husband, had been no\r\npractical hand at anything. In sealing up the sheet, which was folded\r\nand tucked in without an envelope, in the old-fashioned way, she had\r\noverlaid the junction with a large mass of wax without the requisite\r\nunder-touch of the same. The seal had cracked, and the letter was open.\r\nHenchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious\r\nweight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of\r\ndeep respect. \xe2\x80\x9cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\xe2\x80\x99s, I\r\nsuppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan\r\nthe letter:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MICHAEL,\xe2\x80\x94For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing\r\na secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you\r\nwill; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have\r\ndone it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and\r\nElizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\xe2\x80\x99t curse me Mike\xe2\x80\x94think of how I was\r\nsituated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not\r\nyour Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No;\r\nshe died three months after that, and this living one is my other\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first,\r\nand she filled up the ache I felt at the other\xe2\x80\x99s loss. Michael, I am\r\ndying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her\r\nhusband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a\r\nwoman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSAN HENCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nHer husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through\r\nwhich he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress\r\nhis frame, as if to bear better. His usual habit was not to consider\r\nwhether destiny were hard upon him or not\xe2\x80\x94the shape of his ideals in\r\ncases of affliction being simply a moody \xe2\x80\x9cI am to suffer, I perceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis much scourging, then, it is for me.\xe2\x80\x9d But now through his\r\npassionate head there stormed this thought\xe2\x80\x94that the blasting disclosure\r\nwas what he had deserved.\r\n\r\nHis wife\xe2\x80\x99s extreme reluctance to have the girl\xe2\x80\x99s name altered from\r\nNewson to Henchard was now accounted for fully. It furnished another\r\nillustration of that honesty in dishonesty which had characterized her\r\nin other things.\r\n\r\nHe remained unnerved and purposeless for near a couple of hours; till\r\nhe suddenly said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94I wonder if it is true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped up in an impulse, kicked off his slippers, and went with a\r\ncandle to the door of Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s room, where he put his ear to\r\nthe keyhole and listened. She was breathing profoundly. Henchard softly\r\nturned the handle, entered, and shading the light, approached the\r\nbedside. Gradually bringing the light from behind a screening curtain\r\nhe held it in such a manner that it fell slantwise on her face without\r\nshining on her eyes. He steadfastly regarded her features.\r\n\r\nThey were fair: his were dark. But this was an unimportant preliminary.\r\nIn sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts, ancestral\r\ncurves, dead men\xe2\x80\x99s traits, which the mobility of daytime animation\r\nscreens and overwhelms. In the present statuesque repose of the young\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s countenance Richard Newson\xe2\x80\x99s was unmistakably reflected. He\r\ncould not endure the sight of her, and hastened away.\r\n\r\nMisery taught him nothing more than defiant endurance of it. His wife\r\nwas dead, and the first impulse for revenge died with the thought that\r\nshe was beyond him. He looked out at the night as at a fiend. Henchard,\r\nlike all his kind, was superstitious, and he could not help thinking\r\nthat the concatenation of events this evening had produced was the\r\nscheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him. Yet they\r\nhad developed naturally. If he had not revealed his past history to\r\nElizabeth he would not have searched the drawer for papers, and so on.\r\nThe mockery was, that he should have no sooner taught a girl to claim\r\nthe shelter of his paternity than he discovered her to have no kinship\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThis ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from\r\na fellow-creature. Like Prester John\xe2\x80\x99s, his table had been spread, and\r\ninfernal harpies had snatched up the food. He went out of the house,\r\nand moved sullenly onward down the pavement till he came to the bridge\r\nat the bottom of the High Street. Here he turned in upon a bypath on\r\nthe river bank, skirting the north-eastern limits of the town.\r\n\r\nThese precincts embodied the mournful phases of Casterbridge life, as\r\nthe south avenues embodied its cheerful moods. The whole way along here\r\nwas sunless, even in summer time; in spring, white frosts lingered here\r\nwhen other places were steaming with warmth; while in winter it was the\r\nseed-field of all the aches, rheumatisms, and torturing cramps of the\r\nyear. The Casterbridge doctors must have pined away for want of\r\nsufficient nourishment but for the configuration of the landscape on\r\nthe north-eastern side.\r\n\r\nThe river\xe2\x80\x94slow, noiseless, and dark\xe2\x80\x94the Schwarzwasser of\r\nCasterbridge\xe2\x80\x94ran beneath a low cliff, the two together forming a\r\ndefence which had rendered walls and artificial earthworks on this side\r\nunnecessary. Here were ruins of a Franciscan priory, and a mill\r\nattached to the same, the water of which roared down a back-hatch like\r\nthe voice of desolation. Above the cliff, and behind the river, rose a\r\npile of buildings, and in the front of the pile a square mass cut into\r\nthe sky. It was like a pedestal lacking its statue. This missing\r\nfeature, without which the design remained incomplete, was, in truth,\r\nthe corpse of a man, for the square mass formed the base of the\r\ngallows, the extensive buildings at the back being the county gaol. In\r\nthe meadow where Henchard now walked the mob were wont to gather\r\nwhenever an execution took place, and there to the tune of the roaring\r\nweir they stood and watched the spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe exaggeration which darkness imparted to the glooms of this region\r\nimpressed Henchard more than he had expected. The lugubrious harmony of\r\nthe spot with his domestic situation was too perfect for him, impatient\r\nof effects, scenes, and adumbrations. It reduced his heartburning to\r\nmelancholy, and he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the deuce did I come here!\xe2\x80\x9d He went\r\non past the cottage in which the old local hangman had lived and died,\r\nin times before that calling was monopolized over all England by a\r\nsingle gentleman; and climbed up by a steep back lane into the town.\r\n\r\nFor the sufferings of that night, engendered by his bitter\r\ndisappointment, he might well have been pitied. He was like one who had\r\nhalf fainted, and could neither recover nor complete the swoon. In\r\nwords he could blame his wife, but not in his heart; and had he obeyed\r\nthe wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared\r\nhim for long\xe2\x80\x94possibly for ever, Elizabeth-Jane seeming to show no\r\nambition to quit her safe and secluded maiden courses for the\r\nspeculative path of matrimony.\r\n\r\nThe morning came after this night of unrest, and with it the necessity\r\nfor a plan. He was far too self-willed to recede from a position,\r\nespecially as it would involve humiliation. His daughter he had\r\nasserted her to be, and his daughter she should always think herself,\r\nno matter what hyprocrisy it involved.\r\n\r\nBut he was ill-prepared for the first step in this new situation. The\r\nmoment he came into the breakfast-room Elizabeth advanced with open\r\nconfidence to him and took him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought and thought all night of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\r\nsee that everything must be as you say. And I am going to look upon you\r\nas the father that you are, and not to call you Mr. Henchard any more.\r\nIt is so plain to me now. Indeed, father, it is. For, of course, you\r\nwould not have done half the things you have done for me, and let me\r\nhave my own way so entirely, and bought me presents, if I had only been\r\nyour stepdaughter! He\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Newson\xe2\x80\x94whom my poor mother married by such a\r\nstrange mistake\xe2\x80\x9d (Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters\r\nhere), \xe2\x80\x9cwas very kind\xe2\x80\x94O so kind!\xe2\x80\x9d (she spoke with tears in her eyes);\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut that is not the same thing as being one\xe2\x80\x99s real father after all.\r\nNow, father, breakfast is ready!\xe2\x80\x9d she said cheerfully.\r\n\r\nHenchard bent and kissed her cheek. The moment and the act he had\r\nprefigured for weeks with a thrill of pleasure; yet it was no less than\r\na miserable insipidity to him now that it had come. His reinstation of\r\nher mother had been chiefly for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and the fruition of\r\nthe whole scheme was such dust and ashes as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nOf all the enigmas which ever confronted a girl there can have been\r\nseldom one like that which followed Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of himself\r\nto Elizabeth as her father. He had done it in an ardour and an\r\nagitation which had half carried the point of affection with her; yet,\r\nbehold, from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she\r\nhad never seen it before.\r\n\r\nThe coldness soon broke out into open chiding. One grievous failing of\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s was her occasional pretty and picturesque use of dialect\r\nwords\xe2\x80\x94those terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel.\r\n\r\nIt was dinner-time\xe2\x80\x94they never met except at meals\xe2\x80\x94and she happened to\r\nsay when he was rising from table, wishing to show him something, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll bide where you be a minute, father, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Bide where you be,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he echoed sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God, are you only fit\r\nto carry wash to a pig-trough, that ye use such words as those?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened with shame and sadness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant \xe2\x80\x98Stay where you are,\xe2\x80\x99 father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low, humble\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have been more careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and went out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe sharp reprimand was not lost upon her, and in time it came to pass\r\nthat for \xe2\x80\x9cfay\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9csucceed\xe2\x80\x9d; that she no longer spoke of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdumbledores\xe2\x80\x9d but of \xe2\x80\x9chumble bees\xe2\x80\x9d; no longer said of young men and\r\nwomen that they \xe2\x80\x9cwalked together,\xe2\x80\x9d but that they were \xe2\x80\x9cengaged\xe2\x80\x9d; that\r\nshe grew to talk of \xe2\x80\x9cgreggles\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cwild hyacinths\xe2\x80\x9d; that when she had\r\nnot slept she did not quaintly tell the servants next morning that she\r\nhad been \xe2\x80\x9chag-rid,\xe2\x80\x9d but that she had \xe2\x80\x9csuffered from indigestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese improvements, however, are somewhat in advance of the story.\r\nHenchard, being uncultivated himself, was the bitterest critic the fair\r\ngirl could possibly have had of her own lapses\xe2\x80\x94really slight now, for\r\nshe read omnivorously. A gratuitous ordeal was in store for her in the\r\nmatter of her handwriting. She was passing the dining-room door one\r\nevening, and had occasion to go in for something. It was not till she\r\nhad opened the door that she knew the Mayor was there in the company of\r\na man with whom he transacted business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Elizabeth-Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking round at her, \xe2\x80\x9cjust write down\r\nwhat I tell you\xe2\x80\x94a few words of an agreement for me and this gentleman\r\nto sign. I am a poor tool with a pen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe jowned, and so be I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nShe brought forward blotting-book, paper, and ink, and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98An agreement entered into this sixteenth day of\r\nOctober\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94write that first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started the pen in an elephantine march across the sheet. It was a\r\nsplendid round, bold hand of her own conception, a style that would\r\nhave stamped a woman as Minerva\xe2\x80\x99s own in more recent days. But other\r\nideas reigned then: Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s creed was that proper young girls wrote\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99-hand\xe2\x80\x94nay, he believed that bristling characters were as innate\r\nand inseparable a part of refined womanhood as sex itself. Hence when,\r\ninstead of scribbling, like the Princess Ida,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn such a hand as when a field of corn\r\nBows all its ears before the roaring East,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane produced a line of chain-shot and sand-bags, he reddened\r\nin angry shame for her, and, peremptorily saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfinish it,\xe2\x80\x9d dismissed her there and then.\r\n\r\nHer considerate disposition became a pitfall to her now. She was, it\r\nmust be admitted, sometimes provokingly and unnecessarily willing to\r\nsaddle herself with manual labours. She would go to the kitchen instead\r\nof ringing, \xe2\x80\x9cNot to make Phoebe come up twice.\xe2\x80\x9d She went down on her\r\nknees, shovel in hand, when the cat overturned the coal-scuttle;\r\nmoreover, she would persistently thank the parlour-maid for everything,\r\ntill one day, as soon as the girl was gone from the room, Henchard\r\nbroke out with, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God, why dostn\xe2\x80\x99t leave off thanking that girl as\r\nif she were a goddess-born! Don\xe2\x80\x99t I pay her a dozen pound a year to do\r\nthings for \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he\r\nbecame sorry a few minutes after, and said that he did not mean to be\r\nrough.\r\n\r\nThese domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which\r\nsuggested rather than revealed what was underneath. But his passion had\r\nless terror for her than his coldness. The increasing frequency of the\r\nlatter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing\r\ndislike. The more interesting that her appearance and manners became\r\nunder the softening influences which she could now command, and in her\r\nwisdom did command, the more she seemed to estrange him. Sometimes she\r\ncaught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could\r\nhardly bear. Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she\r\nshould for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his\r\nsurname.\r\n\r\nBut the most terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been\r\naccustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and\r\nbread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, who worked in the yard wimbling\r\nhay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards\r\nas a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he\r\nsaw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there\r\nwas no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set\r\nto work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile\r\nstanding with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the\r\npreparations on her behalf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard; and she obeyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with suppressed\r\npassion. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you o\xe2\x80\x99t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a\r\ndrudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndisgrace me to the dust!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn\r\ndoor, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character.\r\nComing to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \xe2\x80\x9cCome to that,\r\nMr. Henchard, I can let \xe2\x80\x99ee know she\xe2\x80\x99ve waited on worse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x99Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a\r\npublic-house in this town!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henchard indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner\r\nthat she could comfortably scratch her elbows.\r\n\r\nHenchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and\r\nwhite from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything or nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was only\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you do it, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? Where was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were\r\nstaying there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for\r\nassuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved\r\nto make the most of her victory. Henchard, however, said nothing about\r\ndischarging her. Unduly sensitive on such points by reason of his own\r\npast, he had the look of one completely ground down to the last\r\nindignity. Elizabeth followed him to the house like a culprit; but when\r\nshe got inside she could not see him. Nor did she see him again that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nConvinced of the scathing damage to his local repute and position that\r\nmust have been caused by such a fact, though it had never before\r\nreached his own ears, Henchard showed a positive distaste for the\r\npresence of this girl not his own, whenever he encountered her. He\r\nmostly dined with the farmers at the market-room of one of the two\r\nchief hotels, leaving her in utter solitude. Could he have seen how she\r\nmade use of those silent hours he might have found reason to reserve\r\nhis judgment on her quality. She read and took notes incessantly,\r\nmastering facts with painful laboriousness, but never flinching from\r\nher self-imposed task. She began the study of Latin, incited by the\r\nRoman characteristics of the town she lived in. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not\r\nwell-informed it shall be by no fault of my own,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to\r\nherself through the tears that would occasionally glide down her peachy\r\ncheeks when she was fairly baffled by the portentous obscurity of many\r\nof these educational works.\r\n\r\nThus she lived on, a dumb, deep-feeling, great-eyed creature, construed\r\nby not a single contiguous being; quenching with patient fortitude her\r\nincipient interest in Farfrae, because it seemed to be one-sided,\r\nunmaidenly, and unwise. True, that for reasons best known to herself,\r\nshe had, since Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, shifted her quarters from the back\r\nroom affording a view of the yard (which she had occupied with such\r\nzest) to a front chamber overlooking the street; but as for the young\r\nman, whenever he passed the house he seldom or never turned his head.\r\n\r\nWinter had almost come, and unsettled weather made her still more\r\ndependent upon indoor resources. But there were certain early winter\r\ndays in Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94days of firmamental exhaustion which followed\r\nangry south-westerly tempests\xe2\x80\x94when, if the sun shone, the air was like\r\nvelvet. She seized on these days for her periodical visits to the spot\r\nwhere her mother lay buried\xe2\x80\x94the still-used burial-ground of the old\r\nRoman-British city, whose curious feature was this, its continuity as a\r\nplace of sepulture. Mrs. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s dust mingled with the dust of women\r\nwho lay ornamented with glass hair-pins and amber necklaces, and men\r\nwho held in their mouths coins of Hadrian, Posthumus, and the\r\nConstantines.\r\n\r\nHalf-past ten in the morning was about her hour for seeking this spot\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntime when the town avenues were deserted as the avenues of Karnac.\r\nBusiness had long since passed down them into its daily cells, and\r\nLeisure had not arrived there. So Elizabeth-Jane walked and read, or\r\nlooked over the edge of the book to think, and thus reached the\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\nThere, approaching her mother\xe2\x80\x99s grave she saw a solitary dark figure in\r\nthe middle of the gravel-walk. This figure, too, was reading; but not\r\nfrom a book: the words which engrossed it being the inscription on Mrs.\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s tombstone. The personage was in mourning like herself, was\r\nabout her age and size, and might have been her wraith or double, but\r\nfor the fact that it was a lady much more beautifully dressed than she.\r\nIndeed, comparatively indifferent as Elizabeth-Jane was to dress,\r\nunless for some temporary whim or purpose, her eyes were arrested by\r\nthe artistic perfection of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. Her gait, too, had a\r\nflexuousness about it, which seemed to avoid angularity. It was a\r\nrevelation to Elizabeth that human beings could reach this stage of\r\nexternal development\xe2\x80\x94she had never suspected it. She felt all the\r\nfreshness and grace to be stolen from herself on the instant by the\r\nneighbourhood of such a stranger. And this was in face of the fact that\r\nElizabeth could now have been writ handsome, while the young lady was\r\nsimply pretty.\r\n\r\nHad she been envious she might have hated the woman; but she did not do\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94she allowed herself the pleasure of feeling fascinated. She\r\nwondered where the lady had come from. The stumpy and practical walk of\r\nhonest homeliness which mostly prevailed there, the two styles of dress\r\nthereabout, the simple and the mistaken, equally avouched that this\r\nfigure was no Casterbridge woman\xe2\x80\x99s, even if a book in her hand\r\nresembling a guide-book had not also suggested it.\r\n\r\nThe stranger presently moved from the tombstone of Mrs. Henchard, and\r\nvanished behind the corner of the wall. Elizabeth went to the tomb\r\nherself; beside it were two footprints distinct in the soil, signifying\r\nthat the lady had stood there a long time. She returned homeward,\r\nmusing on what she had seen, as she might have mused on a rainbow or\r\nthe Northern Lights, a rare butterfly or a cameo.\r\n\r\nInteresting as things had been out of doors, at home it turned out to\r\nbe one of her bad days. Henchard, whose two years\xe2\x80\x99 mayoralty was\r\nending, had been made aware that he was not to be chosen to fill a\r\nvacancy in the list of aldermen; and that Farfrae was likely to become\r\none of the Council. This caused the unfortunate discovery that she had\r\nplayed the waiting-maid in the town of which he was Mayor to rankle in\r\nhis mind yet more poisonously. He had learnt by personal inquiry at the\r\ntime that it was to Donald Farfrae\xe2\x80\x94that treacherous upstart\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\nhad thus humiliated herself. And though Mrs. Stannidge seemed to attach\r\nno great importance to the incident\xe2\x80\x94the cheerful souls at the Three\r\nMariners having exhausted its aspects long ago\xe2\x80\x94such was Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhaughty spirit that the simple thrifty deed was regarded as little less\r\nthan a social catastrophe by him.\r\n\r\nEver since the evening of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arrival with her daughter there\r\nhad been something in the air which had changed his luck. That dinner\r\nat the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms with his friends had been Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s Austerlitz: he\r\nhad had his successes since, but his course had not been upward. He was\r\nnot to be numbered among the aldermen\xe2\x80\x94that Peerage of burghers\xe2\x80\x94as he\r\nhad expected to be, and the consciousness of this soured him to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her with offhand laconism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been strolling in the Walks and churchyard, father, till I feel\r\nquite leery.\xe2\x80\x9d She clapped her hand to her mouth, but too late.\r\n\r\nThis was just enough to incense Henchard after the other crosses of the\r\nday. \xe2\x80\x9cI _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ have you talk like that!\xe2\x80\x9d he thundered. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Leery,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nindeed. One would think you worked upon a farm! One day I learn that\r\nyou lend a hand in public-houses. Then I hear you talk like a\r\nclodhopper. I\xe2\x80\x99m burned, if it goes on, this house can\xe2\x80\x99t hold us two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only way of getting a single pleasant thought to go to sleep upon\r\nafter this was by recalling the lady she had seen that day, and hoping\r\nshe might see her again.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Henchard was sitting up, thinking over his jealous folly in\r\nforbidding Farfrae to pay his addresses to this girl who did not belong\r\nto him, when if he had allowed them to go on he might not have been\r\nencumbered with her. At last he said to himself with satisfaction as he\r\njumped up and went to the writing-table: \xe2\x80\x9cAh! he\xe2\x80\x99ll think it means\r\npeace, and a marriage portion\xe2\x80\x94not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my house to be\r\ntroubled with her, and no portion at all!\xe2\x80\x9d He wrote as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSir,\xe2\x80\x94On consideration, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to interfere with your courtship of\r\nElizabeth-Jane, if you care for her. I therefore withdraw my objection;\r\nexcepting in this\xe2\x80\x94that the business be not carried on in my\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x94Yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nM. HENCHARD.\r\nMr. Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morrow, being fairly fine, found Elizabeth-Jane again in the\r\nchurchyard, but while looking for the lady she was startled by the\r\napparition of Farfrae, who passed outside the gate. He glanced up for a\r\nmoment from a pocket-book in which he appeared to be making figures as\r\nhe went; whether or not he saw her he took no notice, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nUnduly depressed by a sense of her own superfluity she thought he\r\nprobably scorned her; and quite broken in spirit sat down on a bench.\r\nShe fell into painful thought on her position, which ended with her\r\nsaying quite loud, \xe2\x80\x9cO, I wish I was dead with dear mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBehind the bench was a little promenade under the wall where people\r\nsometimes walked instead of on the gravel. The bench seemed to be\r\ntouched by something, she looked round, and a face was bending over\r\nher, veiled, but still distinct, the face of the young woman she had\r\nseen yesterday.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane looked confounded for a moment, knowing she had been\r\noverheard, though there was pleasure in her confusion. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, in a vivacious voice, answering her look. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ncan have happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, putting her hand to her\r\nface to hide a quick flush that had come.\r\n\r\nThere was no movement or word for a few seconds; then the girl felt\r\nthat the young lady was sitting down beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess how it is with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe waved her hand towards the tombstone. Elizabeth looked up at her as\r\nif inquiring of herself whether there should be confidence. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner was so desirous, so anxious, that the girl decided there should\r\nbe confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy only friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your father, Mr. Henchard. He is living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is living,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he not kind to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no wish to complain of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a disagreement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you were to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was\xe2\x80\x94in many ways,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the meek Elizabeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI swept up the coals\r\nwhen the servants ought to have done it; and I said I was leery;\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nwas angry with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady seemed to warm towards her for that reply. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the\r\nimpression your words give me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said ingenuously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat he is a\r\nhot-tempered man\xe2\x80\x94a little proud\xe2\x80\x94perhaps ambitious; but not a bad man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHer anxiety not to condemn Henchard while siding with Elizabeth was\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no; certainly not _bad_,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the honest girl. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has not\r\neven been unkind to me till lately\xe2\x80\x94since mother died. But it has been\r\nvery much to bear while it has lasted. All is owing to my defects, I\r\ndaresay; and my defects are owing to my history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your history?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane looked wistfully at her questioner. She found that her\r\nquestioner was looking at her, turned her eyes down; and then seemed\r\ncompelled to look back again. \xe2\x80\x9cMy history is not gay or attractive,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I can tell it, if you really want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady assured her that she did want to know; whereupon\r\nElizabeth-Jane told the tale of her life as she understood it, which\r\nwas in general the true one, except that the sale at the fair had no\r\npart therein.\r\n\r\nContrary to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s expectation her new friend was not shocked. This\r\ncheered her; and it was not till she thought of returning to that home\r\nin which she had been treated so roughly of late that her spirits fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to return,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cI think of going away. But\r\nwhat can I do? Where can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it will be better soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said her friend gently. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I would\r\nnot go far. Now what do you think of this: I shall soon want somebody\r\nto live in my house, partly as housekeeper, partly as companion; would\r\nyou mind coming to me? But perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI would, indeed\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwould do anything to be independent; for then perhaps my father might\r\nget to love me. But, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no accomplished person. And a companion to you must be that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, not necessarily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot? But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help using rural words sometimes, when I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, I shall like to know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd\xe2\x80\x94O, I know I shan\xe2\x80\x99t do!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she cried with a distressful laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\naccidentally learned to write round hand instead of ladies\xe2\x80\x99-hand. And,\r\nof course, you want some one who can write that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, not necessary to write ladies\xe2\x80\x99-hand?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the joyous\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth expressed her astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was\r\ngetting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call\r\nHigh-Place Hall\xe2\x80\x94the old stone one looking down the lane to the market.\r\nTwo or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep\r\nthere to-night for the first time. Now will you think over my proposal,\r\nand meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still\r\nin the same mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an\r\nunbearable position, joyfully assented; and the two parted at the gate\r\nof the churchyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nAs a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked\r\ntill some mature experience enforces it, so did this High-Place Hall\r\nnow for the first time really show itself to Elizabeth-Jane, though her\r\nears had heard its name on a hundred occasions.\r\n\r\nHer mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house, and\r\nher own chance of living there, all the rest of the day. In the\r\nafternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a\r\nlittle shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to\r\nherself had become a common topic about the streets. High-Place Hall\r\nwas undergoing repair; a lady was coming there to live shortly; all the\r\nshop-people knew it, and had already discounted the chance of her being\r\na customer.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane could, however, add a capping touch to information so\r\nnew to her in the bulk. The lady, she said, had arrived that day.\r\n\r\nWhen the lamps were lighted, and it was yet not so dark as to render\r\nchimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling, thought she would like to look at the outside of High-Place\r\nHall. She went up the street in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe Hall, with its grey _fa\xc3\xa7ade_ and parapet, was the only residence of\r\nits sort so near the centre of the town. It had, in the first place,\r\nthe characteristics of a country mansion\xe2\x80\x94birds\xe2\x80\x99 nests in its chimneys,\r\ndamp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from\r\nNature\xe2\x80\x99s trowel. At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the\r\nlamps in black shadows upon the pale walls.\r\n\r\nThis evening motes of straw lay around, and other signs of the premises\r\nhaving been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a\r\nnew tenant. The house was entirely of stone, and formed an example of\r\ndignity without great size. It was not altogether aristocratic, still\r\nless consequential, yet the old-fashioned stranger instinctively said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlood built it, and Wealth enjoys it\xe2\x80\x9d however vague his opinions of\r\nthose accessories might be.\r\n\r\nYet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong, for\r\nuntil this very evening, when the new lady had arrived, the house had\r\nbeen empty for a year or two while before that interval its occupancy\r\nhad been irregular. The reason of its unpopularity was soon made\r\nmanifest. Some of its rooms overlooked the market-place; and such a\r\nprospect from such a house was not considered desirable or seemly by\r\nits would-be occupiers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sought the upper rooms, and saw lights there. The lady\r\nhad obviously arrived. The impression that this woman of comparatively\r\npractised manner had made upon the studious girl\xe2\x80\x99s mind was so deep\r\nthat she enjoyed standing under an opposite archway merely to think\r\nthat the charming lady was inside the confronting walls, and to wonder\r\nwhat she was doing. Her admiration for the architecture of that front\r\nwas entirely on account of the inmate it screened. Though for that\r\nmatter the architecture deserved admiration, or at least study, on its\r\nown account. It was Palladian, and like most architecture erected since\r\nthe Gothic age was a compilation rather than a design. But its\r\nreasonableness made it impressive. It was not rich, but rich enough. A\r\ntimely consciousness of the ultimate vanity of human architecture, no\r\nless than of other human things, had prevented artistic superfluity.\r\n\r\nMen had still quite recently been going in and out with parcels and\r\npacking-cases, rendering the door and hall within like a public\r\nthoroughfare. Elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk, but\r\nbecoming alarmed at her own temerity she went quickly out again by\r\nanother which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court. To her\r\nsurprise she found herself in one of the little-used alleys of the\r\ntown. Looking round at the door which had given her egress, by the\r\nlight of the solitary lamp fixed in the alley, she saw that it was\r\narched and old\xe2\x80\x94older even than the house itself. The door was studded,\r\nand the keystone of the arch was a mask. Originally the mask had\r\nexhibited a comic leer, as could still be discerned; but generations of\r\nCasterbridge boys had thrown stones at the mask, aiming at its open\r\nmouth; and the blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if\r\nthey had been eaten away by disease. The appearance was so ghastly by\r\nthe weakly lamp-glimmer that she could not bear to look at it\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\nunpleasant feature of her visit.\r\n\r\nThe position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering\r\nmask suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the\r\nmansion\xe2\x80\x99s past history\xe2\x80\x94intrigue. By the alley it had been possible to\r\ncome unseen from all sorts of quarters in the town\xe2\x80\x94the old play-house,\r\nthe old bull-stake, the old cock-pit, the pool wherein nameless infants\r\nhad been used to disappear. High-Place Hall could boast of its\r\nconveniences undoubtedly.\r\n\r\nShe turned to come away in the nearest direction homeward, which was\r\ndown the alley, but hearing footsteps approaching in that quarter, and\r\nhaving no great wish to be found in such a place at such a time she\r\nquickly retreated. There being no other way out she stood behind a\r\nbrick pier till the intruder should have gone his ways.\r\n\r\nHad she watched she would have been surprised. She would have seen that\r\nthe pedestrian on coming up made straight for the arched doorway: that\r\nas he paused with his hand upon the latch the lamplight fell upon the\r\nface of Henchard.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth-Jane clung so closely to her nook that she discerned\r\nnothing of this. Henchard passed in, as ignorant of her presence as she\r\nwas ignorant of his identity, and disappeared in the darkness.\r\nElizabeth came out a second time into the alley, and made the best of\r\nher way home.\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s chiding, by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing\r\nanything definable as unladylike, had operated thus curiously in\r\nkeeping them unknown to each other at a critical moment. Much might\r\nhave resulted from recognition\xe2\x80\x94at the least a query on either side in\r\none and the selfsame form: What could he or she possibly be doing\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nHenchard, whatever his business at the lady\xe2\x80\x99s house, reached his own\r\nhome only a few minutes later than Elizabeth-Jane. Her plan was to\r\nbroach the question of leaving his roof this evening; the events of the\r\nday had urged her to the course. But its execution depended upon his\r\nmood, and she anxiously awaited his manner towards her. She found that\r\nit had changed. He showed no further tendency to be angry; he showed\r\nsomething worse. Absolute indifference had taken the place of\r\nirritability; and his coldness was such that it encouraged her to\r\ndeparture, even more than hot temper could have done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, have you any objection to my going away?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing away! No\xe2\x80\x94none whatever. Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought it undesirable and unnecessary to say anything at present\r\nabout her destination to one who took so little interest in her. He\r\nwould know that soon enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of an opportunity of getting\r\nmore cultivated and finished, and being less idle,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, with\r\nhesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cA chance of a place in a household where I can have\r\nadvantages of study, and seeing refined life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen make the best of it, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94if you can\xe2\x80\x99t get cultivated\r\nwhere you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObject\xe2\x80\x94I? Ho\xe2\x80\x94no! Not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d After a pause he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave enough money for this lively scheme without help, you know? If you\r\nlike I should be willing to make you an allowance, so that you not be\r\nbound to live upon the starvation wages refined folk are likely to pay\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thanked him for this offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had better be done properly,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cA small\r\nannuity is what I should like you to have\xe2\x80\x94so as to be independent of\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94and so that I may be independent of you. Would that please ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll see about it this very day.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed relieved to get her\r\noff his hands by this arrangement, and as far as they were concerned\r\nthe matter was settled. She now simply waited to see the lady again.\r\n\r\nThe day and the hour came; but a drizzling rain fell. Elizabeth-Jane\r\nhaving now changed her orbit from one of gay independence to laborious\r\nself-help, thought the weather good enough for such declined glory as\r\nhers, if her friend would only face it\xe2\x80\x94a matter of doubt. She went to\r\nthe boot-room where her pattens had hung ever since her apotheosis;\r\ntook them down, had their mildewed leathers blacked, and put them on as\r\nshe had done in old times. Thus mounted, and with cloak and umbrella,\r\nshe went off to the place of appointment\xe2\x80\x94intending, if the lady were\r\nnot there, to call at the house.\r\n\r\nOne side of the churchyard\xe2\x80\x94the side towards the weather\xe2\x80\x94was sheltered\r\nby an ancient thatched mud wall whose eaves overhung as much as one or\r\ntwo feet. At the back of the wall was a corn-yard with its granary and\r\nbarns\xe2\x80\x94the place wherein she had met Farfrae many months earlier. Under\r\nthe projection of the thatch she saw a figure. The young lady had come.\r\n\r\nHer presence so exceptionally substantiated the girl\xe2\x80\x99s utmost hopes\r\nthat she almost feared her good fortune. Fancies find rooms in the\r\nstrongest minds. Here, in a churchyard old as civilization, in the\r\nworst of weathers, was a strange woman of curious fascinations never\r\nseen elsewhere: there might be some devilry about her presence.\r\nHowever, Elizabeth went on to the church tower, on whose summit the\r\nrope of a flagstaff rattled in the wind; and thus she came to the wall.\r\n\r\nThe lady had such a cheerful aspect in the drizzle that Elizabeth\r\nforgot her fancy. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, a little of the whiteness of\r\nher teeth appearing with the word through the black fleece that\r\nprotected her face, \xe2\x80\x9chave you decided?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, quite,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father is willing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94as soon as you like. I had a good mind to send to you to come to\r\nmy house, thinking you might not venture up here in the wind. But as I\r\nlike getting out of doors, I thought I would come and see first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my own thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shows we shall agree. Then can you come to-day? My house is so\r\nhollow and dismal that I want some living thing there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I might be able to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, reflecting.\r\n\r\nVoices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and\r\nraindrops from the other side of the wall. There came such words as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csacks,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cquarters,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthreshing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctailing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnext Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s market,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\neach sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked\r\nmirror. Both the women listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are those?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is my father. He rents that yard and barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady seemed to forget the immediate business in listening to the\r\ntechnicalities of the corn trade. At last she said suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\ntell him where you were going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x94how was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it safer to get away first\xe2\x80\x94as he is so uncertain in his\r\ntemper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are right.... Besides, I have never told you my name. It\r\nis Miss Templeman.... Are they gone\xe2\x80\x94on the other side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. They have only gone up into the granary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is getting damp here. I shall expect you to-day\xe2\x80\x94this evening,\r\nsay, at six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way shall I come, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe front way\xe2\x80\x94round by the gate. There is no other that I have\r\nnoticed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane had been thinking of the door in the alley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, as you have not mentioned your destination, you may as well\r\nkeep silent upon it till you are clear off. Who knows but that he may\r\nalter his mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cOn consideration I don\xe2\x80\x99t fear it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has grown quite cold to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Six o\xe2\x80\x99clock then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had emerged upon the open road and parted, they found enough\r\nto do in holding their bowed umbrellas to the wind. Nevertheless the\r\nlady looked in at the corn-yard gates as she passed them, and paused on\r\none foot for a moment. But nothing was visible there save the ricks,\r\nand the humpbacked barn cushioned with moss, and the granary rising\r\nagainst the church-tower behind, where the smacking of the rope against\r\nthe flag-staff still went on.\r\n\r\nNow Henchard had not the slightest suspicion that Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovement was to be so prompt. Hence when, just before six, he reached\r\nhome and saw a fly at the door from the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms, and his\r\nstepdaughter, with all her little bags and boxes, getting into it, he\r\nwas taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said I might go, father?\xe2\x80\x9d she explained through the carriage\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid!\xe2\x80\x94yes. But I thought you meant next month, or next year. \xe2\x80\x99Od,\r\nseize it\xe2\x80\x94you take time by the forelock! This, then, is how you be going\r\nto treat me for all my trouble about ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father! how can you speak like that? It is unjust of you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nwith spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, have your own way,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. He entered the house, and,\r\nseeing that all her things had not yet been brought down, went up to\r\nher room to look on. He had never been there since she had occupied it.\r\nEvidences of her care, of her endeavours for improvement, were visible\r\nall around, in the form of books, sketches, maps, and little\r\narrangements for tasteful effects. Henchard had known nothing of these\r\nefforts. He gazed at them, turned suddenly about, and came down to the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an altered voice\xe2\x80\x94he never called her by name\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee go away from me. It may be I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoke roughly to you\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been grieved beyond everything by you\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s something that\r\ncaused it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with deep concern. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you now. But if you\xe2\x80\x99ll stop, and go on living as my\r\ndaughter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the proposal had come ten minutes too late. She was in the fly\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nalready, in imagination, at the house of the lady whose manner had such\r\ncharms for her. \xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as considerately as she could, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink it best for us that I go on now. I need not stay long; I shall\r\nnot be far away, and if you want me badly I can soon come back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded ever so slightly, as a receipt of her decision and no more.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going far, you say. What will be your address, in case I\r\nwish to write to you? Or am I not to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94certainly. It is only in the town\xe2\x80\x94High-Place Hall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, his face stilling.\r\n\r\nShe repeated the words. He neither moved nor spoke, and waving her hand\r\nto him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nWe go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s attitude.\r\n\r\nAt the hour when Elizabeth-Jane was contemplating her stealthy\r\nreconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy, he had\r\nbeen not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwell-known characters. The self-repression, the resignation of her\r\nprevious communication had vanished from her mood; she wrote with some\r\nof the natural lightness which had marked her in their early\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nHIGH-PLACE HALL\r\nMY DEAR MR. HENCHARD,\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. It is for your good and mine,\r\nas I hope, that I have come to live at Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94for how long I\r\ncannot tell. That depends upon another; and he is a man, and a\r\nmerchant, and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my\r\naffections.\r\n    Seriously, _mon ami_, I am not so light-hearted as I may seem to be\r\n    from this. I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death\r\n    of your wife\xe2\x80\x94whom you used to think of as dead so many years\r\n    before! Poor woman, she seems to have been a sufferer, though\r\n    uncomplaining, and though weak in intellect not an imbecile. I am\r\n    glad you acted fairly by her. As soon as I knew she was no more, it\r\n    was brought home to me very forcibly by my conscience that I ought\r\n    to endeavour to disperse the shade which my _\xc3\xa9tourderie_ flung over\r\n    my name, by asking you to carry out your promise to me. I hope you\r\n    are of the same mind, and that you will take steps to this end. As,\r\n    however, I did not know how you were situated, or what had happened\r\n    since our separation, I decided to come and establish myself here\r\n    before communicating with you.\r\n    You probably feel as I do about this. I shall be able to see you in\r\n    a day or two. Till then, farewell.\xe2\x80\x94Yours,\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCETTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_P.S._\xe2\x80\x94I was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or\r\ntwo in passing through Casterbridge the other day. My plans were\r\naltered by a family event, which it will surprise you to hear of.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenchard had already heard that High-Place Hall was being prepared for\r\na tenant. He said with a puzzled air to the first person he\r\nencountered, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is coming to live at the Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady of the name of Templeman, I believe, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said his informant.\r\n\r\nHenchard thought it over. \xe2\x80\x9cLucetta is related to her, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I must put her in her proper position,\r\nundoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied\r\nthe thought that he regarded the moral necessity now; it was, indeed,\r\nwith interest, if not warmth. His bitter disappointment at finding\r\nElizabeth-Jane to be none of his, and himself a childless man, had left\r\nan emotional void in Henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill. In\r\nthis frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up\r\nthe alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth\r\nhad so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court,\r\nand inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss\r\nLe Sueur was living there. Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which\r\nhe had known Lucetta\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9cLucette,\xe2\x80\x9d as she had called herself at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe man replied in the negative; that Miss Templeman only had come.\r\nHenchard went away, concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in.\r\n\r\nHe was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s departure the next day. On hearing her announce the\r\naddress there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that\r\nLucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could\r\nrecall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich\r\nrelative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been\r\ngiven as Templeman. Though he was not a fortune-hunter, the possibility\r\nthat Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent\r\ntestament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which\r\nit might not otherwise have acquired. He was getting on towards the\r\ndead level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nBut Henchard was not left long in suspense. Lucetta was rather addicted\r\nto scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the\r\n_fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone\r\naway when another note came to the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s house from High-Place Hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in residence,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand comfortable, though getting here\r\nhas been a wearisome undertaking. You probably know what I am going to\r\ntell you, or do you not? My good Aunt Templeman, the banker\xe2\x80\x99s widow,\r\nwhose very existence you used to doubt, much more her affluence, has\r\nlately died, and bequeathed some of her property to me. I will not\r\nenter into details except to say that I have taken her name\xe2\x80\x94as a means\r\nof escape from mine, and its wrongs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now my own mistress, and have chosen to reside in Casterbridge\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbe tenant of High-Place Hall, that at least you may be put to no\r\ntrouble if you wish to see me. My first intention was to keep you in\r\nignorance of the changes in my life till you should meet me in the\r\nstreet; but I have thought better of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter, and have\r\ndoubtless laughed at the\xe2\x80\x94what shall I call it?\xe2\x80\x94practical joke (in all\r\naffection) of my getting her to live with me. But my first meeting with\r\nher was purely an accident. Do you see, Michael, partly why I have done\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x94why, to give you an excuse for coming here as if to visit _her_,\r\nand thus to form my acquaintance naturally. She is a dear, good girl,\r\nand she thinks you have treated her with undue severity. You may have\r\ndone so in your haste, but not deliberately, I am sure. As the result\r\nhas been to bring her to me I am not disposed to upbraid you.\xe2\x80\x94In haste,\r\nyours always,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLUCETTA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe excitement which these announcements produced in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s gloomy\r\nsoul was to him most pleasurable. He sat over his dining-table long and\r\ndreamily, and by an almost mechanical transfer the sentiments which had\r\nrun to waste since his estrangement from Elizabeth-Jane and Donald\r\nFarfrae gathered around Lucetta before they had grown dry. She was\r\nplainly in a very coming-on disposition for marriage. But what else\r\ncould a poor woman be who had given her time and her heart to him so\r\nthoughtlessly, at that former time, as to lose her credit by it?\r\nProbably conscience no less than affection had brought her here. On the\r\nwhole he did not blame her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe artful little woman!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling (with reference to\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s adroit and pleasant man\xc5\x93uvre with Elizabeth-Jane).\r\n\r\nTo feel that he would like to see Lucetta was with Henchard to start\r\nfor her house. He put on his hat and went. It was between eight and\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he reached her door. The answer brought him was that\r\nMiss Templeman was engaged for that evening; but that she would be\r\nhappy to see him the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s rather like giving herself airs!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd considering\r\nwhat we\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But after all, she plainly had not expected him, and he took\r\nthe refusal quietly. Nevertheless he resolved not to go next day.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese cursed women\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s not an inch of straight grain in \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the train of Mr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s thought as if it were a clue\r\nline, and view the interior of High-Place Hall on this particular\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOn Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an\r\nelderly woman to go upstairs and take off her things. She replied with\r\ngreat earnestness that she would not think of giving that trouble, and\r\non the instant divested herself of her bonnet and cloak in the passage.\r\nShe was then conducted to the first floor on the landing, and left to\r\nfind her way further alone.\r\n\r\nThe room disclosed was prettily furnished as a boudoir or small\r\ndrawing-room, and on a sofa with two cylindrical pillows reclined a\r\ndark-haired, large-eyed, pretty woman, of unmistakably French\r\nextraction on one side or the other. She was probably some years older\r\nthan Elizabeth, and had a sparkling light in her eye. In front of the\r\nsofa was a small table, with a pack of cards scattered upon it faces\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nThe attitude had been so full of abandonment that she bounded up like a\r\nspring on hearing the door open.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that it was Elizabeth she lapsed into ease, and came across\r\nto her with a reckless skip that innate grace only prevented from being\r\nboisterous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are late,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking hold of Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were so many little things to put up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you seem dead-alive and tired. Let me try to enliven you by some\r\nwonderful tricks I have learnt, to kill time. Sit there and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmove.\xe2\x80\x9d She gathered up the pack of cards, pulled the table in front of\r\nher, and began to deal them rapidly, telling Elizabeth to choose some.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you chosen?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked flinging down the last card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Elizabeth, arousing herself from a reverie. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot,\r\nI was thinking of\xe2\x80\x94you, and me\xe2\x80\x94and how strange it is that I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Templeman looked at Elizabeth-Jane with interest, and laid down\r\nthe cards. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll lie here while you sit by\r\nme; and we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa, but with obvious\r\npleasure. It could be seen that though in years she was younger than\r\nher entertainer in manner and general vision she seemed more of the\r\nsage. Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former\r\nflexuous position, and throwing her arm above her brow\xe2\x80\x94somewhat in the\r\npose of a well-known conception of Titian\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94talked up at Elizabeth-Jane\r\ninvertedly across her forehead and arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you have suspected\r\nit. I have only been mistress of a large house and fortune a little\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94only a little while?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Elizabeth-Jane, her countenance\r\nslightly falling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a girl I lived about in garrison towns and elsewhere with my\r\nfather, till I was quite flighty and unsettled. He was an officer in\r\nthe army. I should not have mentioned this had I not thought it best\r\nyou should know the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked thoughtfully round the room\xe2\x80\x94at the little square\r\npiano with brass inlayings, at the window-curtains, at the lamp, at the\r\nfair and dark kings and queens on the card-table, and finally at the\r\ninverted face of Lucetta Templeman, whose large lustrous eyes had such\r\nan odd effect upside down.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s mind ran on acquirements to an almost morbid degree. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nspeak French and Italian fluently, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\r\nbeen able to get beyond a wretched bit of Latin yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for that matter, in my native isle speaking French does not go\r\nfor much. It is rather the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your native isle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was with rather more reluctance that Miss Templeman said, \xe2\x80\x9cJersey.\r\nThere they speak French on one side of the street and English on the\r\nother, and a mixed tongue in the middle of the road. But it is a long\r\ntime since I was there. Bath is where my people really belong to,\r\nthough my ancestors in Jersey were as good as anybody in England. They\r\nwere the Le Sueurs, an old family who have done great things in their\r\ntime. I went back and lived there after my father\xe2\x80\x99s death. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nvalue such past matters, and am quite an English person in my feelings\r\nand tastes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s tongue had for a moment outrun her discretion. She had\r\narrived at Casterbridge as a Bath lady, and there were obvious reasons\r\nwhy Jersey should drop out of her life. But Elizabeth had tempted her\r\nto make free, and a deliberately formed resolve had been broken.\r\n\r\nIt could not, however, have been broken in safer company. Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords went no further, and after this day she was so much upon her\r\nguard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the\r\nyoung Jersey woman who had been Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s dear comrade at a critical\r\ntime. Not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute\r\navoidance of a French word if one by accident came to her tongue more\r\nreadily than its English equivalent. She shirked it with the suddenness\r\nof the weak Apostle at the accusation, \xe2\x80\x9cThy speech bewrayeth thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExpectancy sat visibly upon Lucetta the next morning. She dressed\r\nherself for Mr. Henchard, and restlessly awaited his call before\r\nmid-day; as he did not come she waited on through the afternoon. But\r\nshe did not tell Elizabeth that the person expected was the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstepfather.\r\n\r\nThey sat in adjoining windows of the same room in Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s great stone\r\nmansion, netting, and looking out upon the market, which formed an\r\nanimated scene. Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s hat\r\namong the rest beneath, and was not aware that Lucetta watched the same\r\nobject with yet intenser interest. He moved about amid the throng, at\r\nthis point lively as an ant-hill; elsewhere more reposeful, and broken\r\nup by stalls of fruit and vegetables. The farmers as a rule preferred\r\nthe open _carrefour_ for their transactions, despite its inconvenient\r\njostlings and the danger from crossing vehicles, to the gloomy\r\nsheltered market-room provided for them. Here they surged on this one\r\nday of the week, forming a little world of leggings, switches, and\r\nsample-bags; men of extensive stomachs, sloping like mountain sides;\r\nmen whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in November gales; who\r\nin conversing varied their attitudes much, lowering themselves by\r\nspreading their knees, and thrusting their hands into the pockets of\r\nremote inner jackets. Their faces radiated tropical warmth; for though\r\nwhen at home their countenances varied with the seasons, their\r\nmarket-faces all the year round were glowing little fires.\r\n\r\nAll over-clothes here were worn as if they were an inconvenience, a\r\nhampering necessity. Some men were well dressed; but the majority were\r\ncareless in that respect, appearing in suits which were historical\r\nrecords of their wearer\xe2\x80\x99s deeds, sun-scorchings, and daily struggles\r\nfor many years past. Yet many carried ruffled cheque-books in their\r\npockets which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less\r\nthan four figures. In fact, what these gibbous human shapes specially\r\nrepresented was ready money\xe2\x80\x94money insistently ready\xe2\x80\x94not ready next year\r\nlike a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94often not merely ready at the bank like a\r\nprofessional man\xe2\x80\x99s, but ready in their large plump hands.\r\n\r\nIt happened that to-day there rose in the midst of them all two or\r\nthree tall apple-trees standing as if they grew on the spot; till it\r\nwas perceived that they were held by men from the cider-districts who\r\ncame here to sell them, bringing the clay of their county on their\r\nboots. Elizabeth-Jane, who had often observed them, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if\r\nthe same trees come every week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat trees?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta, absorbed in watching for Henchard.\r\n\r\nElizabeth replied vaguely, for an incident checked her. Behind one of\r\nthe trees stood Farfrae, briskly discussing a sample-bag with a farmer.\r\nHenchard had come up, accidentally encountering the young man, whose\r\nface seemed to inquire, \xe2\x80\x9cDo we speak to each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nElizabeth-Jane sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you particularly interested in anybody out there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face.\r\n\r\nLuckily Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s figure was immediately covered by the apple-tree.\r\n\r\nLucetta looked hard at her. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\nAgain Lucetta looked out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all farmers, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. There\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Bulge\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a wine merchant; there\xe2\x80\x99s Benjamin\r\nBrownlet\xe2\x80\x94a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the\r\nauctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers\xe2\x80\x94and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d Farfrae stood\r\nout quite distinctly now; but she did not mention him.\r\n\r\nThe Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily. The market changed\r\nfrom the sample-showing hour to the idle hour before starting\r\nhomewards, when tales were told. Henchard had not called on Lucetta\r\nthough he had stood so near. He must have been too busy, she thought.\r\nHe would come on Sunday or Monday.\r\n\r\nThe days came but not the visitor, though Lucetta repeated her dressing\r\nwith scrupulous care. She got disheartened. It may at once be declared\r\nthat Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance\r\nwhich had characterized her in their first acquaintance, the then\r\nunfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably. But\r\nthere remained a conscientious wish to bring about her union with him,\r\nnow that there was nothing to hinder it\xe2\x80\x94to right her position\xe2\x80\x94which in\r\nitself was a happiness to sigh for. With strong social reasons on her\r\nside why their marriage should take place there had ceased to be any\r\nworldly reason on his why it should be postponed, since she had\r\nsucceeded to fortune.\r\n\r\nTuesday was the great Candlemas fair. At breakfast she said to\r\nElizabeth-Jane quite coolly: \xe2\x80\x9cI imagine your father may call to see you\r\nto-day. I suppose he stands close by in the market-place with the rest\r\nof the corn-dealers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has taken against me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a husky voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have quarreled more deeply than I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth, wishing to shield the man she believed to be her father from\r\nany charge of unnatural dislike, said \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen where you are is, of all places, the one he will avoid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth nodded sadly.\r\n\r\nLucetta looked blank, twitched up her lovely eyebrows and lip, and\r\nburst into hysterical sobs. Here was a disaster\xe2\x80\x94her ingenious scheme\r\ncompletely stultified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my dear Miss Templeman\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried her companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your company much!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta, as soon as she could speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes\xe2\x80\x94and so do I yours!\xe2\x80\x9d Elizabeth chimed in soothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She could not finish the sentence, which was, naturally,\r\nthat if Henchard had such a rooted dislike for the girl as now seemed\r\nto be the case, Elizabeth-Jane would have to be got rid of\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndisagreeable necessity.\r\n\r\nA provisional resource suggested itself. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Henchard\xe2\x80\x94will you go on\r\nan errand for me as soon as breakfast is over?\xe2\x80\x94Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s very good of\r\nyou. Will you go and order\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here she enumerated several commissions at\r\nsundry shops, which would occupy Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s time for the next hour or\r\ntwo, at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you ever seen the Museum?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane had not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you should do so at once. You can finish the morning by going\r\nthere. It is an old house in a back street\xe2\x80\x94I forget where\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind out\xe2\x80\x94and there are crowds of interesting things\xe2\x80\x94skeletons, teeth,\r\nold pots and pans, ancient boots and shoes, birds\xe2\x80\x99 eggs\xe2\x80\x94all charmingly\r\ninstructive. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to stay till you get quite hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth hastily put on her things and departed. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why she\r\nwants to get rid of me to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d she said sorrowfully as she went. That\r\nher absence, rather than her services or instruction, was in request,\r\nhad been readily apparent to Elizabeth-Jane, simple as she seemed, and\r\ndifficult as it was to attribute a motive for the desire.\r\n\r\nShe had not been gone ten minutes when one of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s servants was\r\nsent to Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s with a note. The contents were briefly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDEAR MICHAEL,\xe2\x80\x94You will be standing in view of my house to-day for two\r\nor three hours in the course of your business, so do please call and\r\nsee me. I am sadly disappointed that you have not come before, for can\r\nI help anxiety about my own equivocal relation to you?\xe2\x80\x94especially now\r\nmy aunt\xe2\x80\x99s fortune has brought me more prominently before society? Your\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s presence here may be the cause of your neglect; and I have\r\ntherefore sent her away for the morning. Say you come on business\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshall be quite alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCETTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the messenger returned her mistress gave directions that if a\r\ngentleman called he was to be admitted at once, and sat down to await\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nSentimentally she did not much care to see him\xe2\x80\x94his delays had wearied\r\nher, but it was necessary; and with a sigh she arranged herself\r\npicturesquely in the chair; first this way, then that; next so that the\r\nlight fell over her head. Next she flung herself on the couch in the\r\ncyma-recta curve which so became her, and with her arm over her brow\r\nlooked towards the door. This, she decided, was the best position after\r\nall, and thus she remained till a man\xe2\x80\x99s step was heard on the stairs.\r\nWhereupon Lucetta, forgetting her curve (for Nature was too strong for\r\nArt as yet), jumped up and ran and hid herself behind one of the\r\nwindow-curtains in a freak of timidity. In spite of the waning of\r\npassion the situation was an agitating one\xe2\x80\x94she had not seen Henchard\r\nsince his (supposed) temporary parting from her in Jersey.\r\n\r\nShe could hear the servant showing the visitor into the room, shutting\r\nthe door upon him, and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress.\r\nLucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting. The man before\r\nher was not Henchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nA conjecture that her visitor might be some other person had, indeed,\r\nflashed through Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s mind when she was on the point of bursting\r\nout; but it was just too late to recede.\r\n\r\nHe was years younger than the Mayor of Casterbridge; fair, fresh, and\r\nslenderly handsome. He wore genteel cloth leggings with white buttons,\r\npolished boots with infinite lace holes, light cord breeches under a\r\nblack velveteen coat and waistcoat; and he had a silver-topped switch\r\nin his hand. Lucetta blushed, and said with a curious mixture of pout\r\nand laugh on her face\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visitor, on the contrary, did not laugh half a wrinkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in deprecating tones. \xe2\x80\x9cI came and I\r\ninquired for Miss Henchard, and they showed me up here, and in no case\r\nwould I have caught ye so unmannerly if I had known!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was the unmannerly one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it that I have come to the wrong house, madam?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nFarfrae, blinking a little in his bewilderment and nervously tapping\r\nhis legging with his switch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, sir,\xe2\x80\x94sit down. You must come and sit down now you are here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Lucetta kindly, to relieve his embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Henchard\r\nwill be here directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow this was not strictly true; but that something about the young\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94that hyperborean crispness, stringency, and charm, as of a\r\nwell-braced musical instrument, which had awakened the interest of\r\nHenchard, and of Elizabeth-Jane and of the Three Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 jovial crew,\r\nat sight, made his unexpected presence here attractive to Lucetta. He\r\nhesitated, looked at the chair, thought there was no danger in it\r\n(though there was), and sat down.\r\n\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s sudden entry was simply the result of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s permission\r\nto him to see Elizabeth if he were minded to woo her. At first he had\r\ntaken no notice of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s brusque letter; but an exceptionally\r\nfortunate business transaction put him on good terms with everybody,\r\nand revealed to him that he could undeniably marry if he chose. Then\r\nwho so pleasing, thrifty, and satisfactory in every way as\r\nElizabeth-Jane? Apart from her personal recommendations a\r\nreconciliation with his former friend Henchard would, in the natural\r\ncourse of things, flow from such a union. He therefore forgave the\r\nMayor his curtness; and this morning on his way to the fair he had\r\ncalled at her house, where he learnt that she was staying at Miss\r\nTempleman\xe2\x80\x99s. A little stimulated at not finding her ready and\r\nwaiting\xe2\x80\x94so fanciful are men!\xe2\x80\x94he hastened on to High-Place Hall to\r\nencounter no Elizabeth but its mistress herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fair to-day seems a large one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said when, by natural\r\ndeviation, their eyes sought the busy scene without. \xe2\x80\x9cYour numerous\r\nfairs and markets keep me interested. How many things I think of while\r\nI watch from here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed in doubt how to answer, and the babble without reached them\r\nas they sat\xe2\x80\x94voices as of wavelets on a looping sea, one ever and anon\r\nrising above the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you look out often?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94very often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you look for any one you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy should she have answered as she did?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI look as at a picture merely. But,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning pleasantly\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x9cI may do so now\xe2\x80\x94I may look for you. You are always there, are\r\nyou not? Ah\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it seriously! But it is amusing to look for\r\nsomebody one knows in a crowd, even if one does not want him. It takes\r\noff the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng, and\r\nhaving no point of junction with it through a single individual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll be very lonely, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows how lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are rich, they say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to enjoy my riches. I came to Casterbridge\r\nthinking I should like to live here. But I wonder if I shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did ye come from, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe neighbourhood of Bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I from near Edinboro\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better to stay at home,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s true; but a man must live where his money is made. It is a\r\ngreat pity, but it\xe2\x80\x99s always so! Yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve done very well this year. O\r\nyes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with ingenuous enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see that man with the\r\ndrab kerseymere coat? I bought largely of him in the autumn when wheat\r\nwas down, and then afterwards when it rose a little I sold off all I\r\nhad! It brought only a small profit to me; while the farmers kept\r\ntheirs, expecting higher figures\xe2\x80\x94yes, though the rats were gnawing the\r\nricks hollow. Just when I sold the markets went lower, and I bought up\r\nthe corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first\r\npurchases. And then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Farfrae impetuously, his face alight, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsold it a few weeks after, when it happened to go up again! And so, by\r\ncontenting mysel\xe2\x80\x99 with small profits frequently repeated, I soon made\r\nfive hundred pounds\xe2\x80\x94yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(bringing down his hand upon the table, and\r\nquite forgetting where he was)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhile the others by keeping theirs in\r\nhand made nothing at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta regarded him with a critical interest. He was quite a new type\r\nof person to her. At last his eye fell upon the lady\xe2\x80\x99s and their\r\nglances met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, now, I\xe2\x80\x99m wearying you!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d colouring a shade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite otherwise. You are most interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now Farfrae who showed the modest pink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean all you Scotchmen,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in hasty correction. \xe2\x80\x9cSo free\r\nfrom Southern extremes. We common people are all one way or the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94warm or cold, passionate or frigid. You have both temperatures\r\ngoing on in you at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you mean that? Ye were best to explain clearly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are animated\xe2\x80\x94then you are thinking of getting on. You are sad the\r\nnext moment\xe2\x80\x94then you are thinking of Scotland and friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I think of home sometimes!\xe2\x80\x9d he said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I\xe2\x80\x94as far as I can. But it was an old house where I was born, and\r\nthey pulled it down for improvements, so I seem hardly to have any home\r\nto think of now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta did not add, as she might have done, that the house was in St.\r\nHelier, and not in Bath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the mountains, and the mists and the rocks, they are there! And\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t they seem like home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do to me\xe2\x80\x94they do to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. And his mind could be seen\r\nflying away northwards. Whether its origin were national or personal,\r\nit was quite true what Lucetta had said, that the curious double\r\nstrands in Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s thread of life\xe2\x80\x94the commercial and the\r\nromantic\xe2\x80\x94were very distinct at times. Like the colours in a variegated\r\ncord those contrasts could be seen intertwisted, yet not mingling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wishing you were back again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, suddenly recalling himself.\r\n\r\nThe fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud. It was the\r\nchief hiring fair of the year, and differed quite from the market of a\r\nfew days earlier. In substance it was a whitey-brown crowd flecked with\r\nwhite\xe2\x80\x94this being the body of labourers waiting for places. The long\r\nbonnets of the women, like waggon-tilts, their cotton gowns and checked\r\nshawls, mixed with the carters\xe2\x80\x99 smockfrocks; for they, too, entered\r\ninto the hiring. Among the rest, at the corner of the pavement, stood\r\nan old shepherd, who attracted the eyes of Lucetta and Farfrae by his\r\nstillness. He was evidently a chastened man. The battle of life had\r\nbeen a sharp one with him, for, to begin with, he was a man of small\r\nframe. He was now so bowed by hard work and years that, approaching\r\nfrom behind, a person could hardly see his head. He had planted the\r\nstem of his crook in the gutter and was resting upon the bow, which was\r\npolished to silver brightness by the long friction of his hands. He had\r\nquite forgotten where he was, and what he had come for, his eyes being\r\nbent on the ground. A little way off negotiations were proceeding which\r\nhad reference to him; but he did not hear them, and there seemed to be\r\npassing through his mind pleasant visions of the hiring successes of\r\nhis prime, when his skill laid open to him any farm for the asking.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were between a farmer from a distant county and the\r\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s son. In these there was a difficulty. The farmer would not\r\ntake the crust without the crumb of the bargain, in other words, the\r\nold man without the younger; and the son had a sweetheart on his\r\npresent farm, who stood by, waiting the issue with pale lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to leave ye, Nelly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man with emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nyou see, I can\xe2\x80\x99t starve father, and he\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99 work at Lady-day. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nonly thirty-five mile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s lips quivered. \xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five mile!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nenough! I shall never see \xe2\x80\x99ee again!\xe2\x80\x9d It was, indeed, a hopeless length\r\nof traction for Dan Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s magnet; for young men were young men at\r\nCasterbridge as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! no, no\xe2\x80\x94I never shall,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted, when he pressed her hand; and\r\nshe turned her face to Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s wall to hide her weeping. The farmer\r\nsaid he would give the young man half-an-hour for his answer, and went\r\naway, leaving the group sorrowing.\r\n\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, full of tears, met Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s. His, too, to her\r\nsurprise, were moist at the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with strong feelings. \xe2\x80\x9cLovers ought not to\r\nbe parted like that! O, if I had my wish, I\xe2\x80\x99d let people live and love\r\nat their pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I can manage that they\xe2\x80\x99ll not be parted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\r\na young carter; and perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the old man too\xe2\x80\x94yes; he\xe2\x80\x99ll not be\r\nvery expensive, and doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you are so good!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, delighted. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell them, and let\r\nme know if you have succeeded!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae went out, and she saw him speak to the group. The eyes of all\r\nbrightened; the bargain was soon struck. Farfrae returned to her\r\nimmediately it was concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is kind-hearted of you, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my part, I have\r\nresolved that all my servants shall have lovers if they want them! Do\r\nmake the same resolve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae looked more serious, waving his head a half turn. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be a\r\nlittle stricter than that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a\xe2\x80\x94a thriving woman; and I am a struggling hay-and-corn\r\nmerchant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a very ambitious woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, I cannet explain. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to talk to ladies,\r\nambitious or no; and that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald with grave regret. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntry to be civil to a\xe2\x80\x99 folk\xe2\x80\x94no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you are as you say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, sensibly getting the upper\r\nhand in these exchanges of sentiment. Under this revelation of insight\r\nFarfrae again looked out of the window into the thick of the fair.\r\n\r\nTwo farmers met and shook hands, and being quite near the window their\r\nremarks could be heard as others\xe2\x80\x99 had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen young Mr. Farfrae this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one. \xe2\x80\x9cHe promised\r\nto meet me here at the stroke of twelve; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone athwart and\r\nabout the fair half-a-dozen times, and never a sign of him: though he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmostly a man to his word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite forgot the engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you must go,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cmust you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. But he still remained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go,\xe2\x80\x9d she urged. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will lose a customer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Templeman, you will make me angry,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t go; but stay a little longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously at the farmer who was seeking him and who just then\r\nominously walked across to where Henchard was standing, and he looked\r\ninto the room and at her. \xe2\x80\x9cI like staying; but I fear I must go!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness ought not to be neglected, ought it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for a single minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come another time\xe2\x80\x94if I may, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to us to-day is very\r\ncurious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething to think over when we are alone, it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. It is commonplace after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not say that. O no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever it has been, it is now over; and the market calls you\r\nto be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Market\xe2\x80\x94business! I wish there were no business in the\r\nwarrld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta almost laughed\xe2\x80\x94she would quite have laughed\xe2\x80\x94but that there was\r\na little emotion going in her at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you change!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not change like this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never wished such things before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scotchman, with a\r\nsimple, shamed, apologetic look for his weakness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only since\r\ncoming here and seeing you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, you had better not look at me any longer. Dear me,\r\nI feel I have quite demoralized you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look or look not, I will see you in my thoughts. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo\xe2\x80\x94thank you for the pleasure of this visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for staying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll get into my market-mind when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out a few minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he went she said eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou may hear them speak of me in\r\nCasterbridge as time goes on. If they tell you I\xe2\x80\x99m a coquette, which\r\nsome may, because of the incidents of my life, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, for I\r\nam not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I will not!\xe2\x80\x9d he said fervidly.\r\n\r\nThus the two. She had enkindled the young man\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm till he was\r\nquite brimming with sentiment; while he from merely affording her a new\r\nform of idleness, had gone on to wake her serious solicitude. Why was\r\nthis? They could not have told.\r\n\r\nLucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman. But\r\nher ups and downs, capped by her indiscretions with Henchard had made\r\nher uncritical as to station. In her poverty she had met with repulse\r\nfrom the society to which she had belonged, and she had no great zest\r\nfor renewing an attempt upon it now. Her heart longed for some ark into\r\nwhich it could fly and be at rest. Rough or smooth she did not care so\r\nlong as it was warm.\r\n\r\nFarfrae was shown out, it having entirely escaped him that he had\r\ncalled to see Elizabeth. Lucetta at the window watched him threading\r\nthe maze of farmers and farmers\xe2\x80\x99 men. She could see by his gait that he\r\nwas conscious of her eyes, and her heart went out to him for his\r\nmodesty\xe2\x80\x94pleaded with her sense of his unfitness that he might be\r\nallowed to come again. He entered the market-house, and she could see\r\nhim no more.\r\n\r\nThree minutes later, when she had left the window, knocks, not of\r\nmultitude but of strength, sounded through the house, and the\r\nwaiting-maid tripped up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mayor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nLucetta had reclined herself, and she was looking dreamily through her\r\nfingers. She did not answer at once, and the maid repeated the\r\ninformation with the addition, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t much time to\r\nspare, he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Then tell him that as I have a headache I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain him\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe message was taken down, and she heard the door close.\r\n\r\nLucetta had come to Casterbridge to quicken Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s feelings with\r\nregard to her. She had quickened them, and now she was indifferent to\r\nthe achievement.\r\n\r\nHer morning view of Elizabeth-Jane as a disturbing element changed, and\r\nshe no longer felt strongly the necessity of getting rid of the girl\r\nfor her stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s sake. When the young woman came in, sweetly\r\nunconscious of the turn in the tide, Lucetta went up to her, and said\r\nquite sincerely\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come. You\xe2\x80\x99ll live with me a long time, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth as a watch-dog to keep her father off\xe2\x80\x94what a new idea. Yet it\r\nwas not unpleasing. Henchard had neglected her all these days, after\r\ncompromising her indescribably in the past. The least he could have\r\ndone when he found himself free, and herself affluent, would have been\r\nto respond heartily and promptly to her invitation.\r\n\r\nHer emotions rose, fell, undulated, filled her with wild surmise at\r\ntheir suddenness; and so passed Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s experiences of that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nPoor Elizabeth-Jane, little thinking what her malignant star had done\r\nto blast the budding attentions she had won from Donald Farfrae, was\r\nglad to hear Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s words about remaining.\r\n\r\nFor in addition to Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s house being a home, that raking view of\r\nthe market-place which it afforded had as much attraction for her as\r\nfor Lucetta. The _carrefour_ was like the regulation Open Place in\r\nspectacular dramas, where the incidents that occur always happen to\r\nbear on the lives of the adjoining residents. Farmers, merchants,\r\ndairymen, quacks, hawkers, appeared there from week to week, and\r\ndisappeared as the afternoon wasted away. It was the node of all\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nFrom Saturday to Saturday was as from day to day with the two young\r\nwomen now. In an emotional sense they did not live at all during the\r\nintervals. Wherever they might go wandering on other days, on\r\nmarket-day they were sure to be at home. Both stole sly glances out of\r\nthe window at Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and poll. His face they seldom saw,\r\nfor, either through shyness, or not to disturb his mercantile mood, he\r\navoided looking towards their quarters.\r\n\r\nThus things went on, till a certain market-morning brought a new\r\nsensation. Elizabeth and Lucetta were sitting at breakfast when a\r\nparcel containing two dresses arrived for the latter from London. She\r\ncalled Elizabeth from her breakfast, and entering her friend\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\r\nElizabeth saw the gowns spread out on the bed, one of a deep cherry\r\ncolour, the other lighter\xe2\x80\x94a glove lying at the end of each sleeve, a\r\nbonnet at the top of each neck, and parasols across the gloves, Lucetta\r\nstanding beside the suggested human figure in an attitude of\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so hard about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth, marking the\r\nintensity with which Lucetta was alternating the question whether this\r\nor that would suit best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut settling upon new clothes is so trying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nthat person\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to one of the arrangements), \xe2\x80\x9cor you are _that_\r\ntotally different person\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to the other), \xe2\x80\x9cfor the whole of\r\nthe coming spring and one of the two, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know which, may turn\r\nout to be very objectionable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided by Miss Templeman that she would be the\r\ncherry-coloured person at all hazards. The dress was pronounced to be a\r\nfit, and Lucetta walked with it into the front room, Elizabeth\r\nfollowing her.\r\n\r\nThe morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year. The sun fell\r\nso flat on the houses and pavement opposite Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s residence that\r\nthey poured their brightness into her rooms. Suddenly, after a rumbling\r\nof wheels, there were added to this steady light a fantastic series of\r\ncircling irradiations upon the ceiling, and the companions turned to\r\nthe window. Immediately opposite a vehicle of strange description had\r\ncome to a standstill, as if it had been placed there for exhibition.\r\n\r\nIt was the new-fashioned agricultural implement called a horse-drill,\r\ntill then unknown, in its modern shape, in this part of the country,\r\nwhere the venerable seed-lip was still used for sowing as in the days\r\nof the Heptarchy. Its arrival created about as much sensation in the\r\ncorn-market as a flying machine would create at Charing Cross. The\r\nfarmers crowded round it, women drew near it, children crept under and\r\ninto it. The machine was painted in bright hues of green, yellow, and\r\nred, and it resembled as a whole a compound of hornet, grasshopper, and\r\nshrimp, magnified enormously. Or it might have been likened to an\r\nupright musical instrument with the front gone. That was how it struck\r\nLucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is a sort of agricultural piano,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has something to do with corn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who thought of introducing it here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDonald Farfrae was in the minds of both as the innovator, for though\r\nnot a farmer he was closely leagued with farming operations. And as if\r\nin response to their thought he came up at that moment, looked at the\r\nmachine, walked round it, and handled it as if he knew something about\r\nits make. The two watchers had inwardly started at his coming, and\r\nElizabeth left the window, went to the back of the room, and stood as\r\nif absorbed in the panelling of the wall. She hardly knew that she had\r\ndone this till Lucetta, animated by the conjunction of her new attire\r\nwith the sight of Farfrae, spoke out: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and look at the\r\ninstrument, whatever it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet and shawl were pitchforked on in a moment, and\r\nthey went out. Among all the agriculturists gathered round the only\r\nappropriate possessor of the new machine seemed to be Lucetta, because\r\nshe alone rivalled it in colour.\r\n\r\nThey examined it curiously; observing the rows of trumpet-shaped tubes\r\none within the other, the little scoops, like revolving salt-spoons,\r\nwhich tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted\r\nit to the ground; till somebody said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Elizabeth-Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe looked up, and there was her stepfather.\r\n\r\nHis greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous, and Elizabeth-Jane,\r\nembarrassed out of her equanimity, stammered at random, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the\r\nlady I live with, father\xe2\x80\x94Miss Templeman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard put his hand to his hat, which he brought down with a great\r\nwave till it met his body at the knee. Miss Templeman bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nhappy to become acquainted with you, Mr. Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\na curious machine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard replied; and he proceeded to explain it, and still more\r\nforcibly to ridicule it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho brought it here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing\xe2\x80\x94why \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nimpossible it should act. \xe2\x80\x99Twas brought here by one of our machinists\r\non the recommendation of a jumped-up jackanapes of a fellow who\r\nthinks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d His eye caught Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s imploring face, and he\r\nstopped, probably thinking that the suit might be progressing.\r\n\r\nHe turned to go away. Then something seemed to occur which his\r\nstepdaughter fancied must really be a hallucination of hers. A murmur\r\napparently came from Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s lips in which she detected the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou refused to see me!\xe2\x80\x9d reproachfully addressed to Lucetta. She could\r\nnot believe that they had been uttered by her stepfather; unless,\r\nindeed, they might have been spoken to one of the yellow-gaitered\r\nfarmers near them. Yet Lucetta seemed silent, and then all thought of\r\nthe incident was dissipated by the humming of a song, which sounded as\r\nthough from the interior of the machine. Henchard had by this time\r\nvanished into the market-house, and both the women glanced towards the\r\ncorn-drill. They could see behind it the bent back of a man who was\r\npushing his head into the internal works to master their simple\r\nsecrets. The hummed song went on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tw\xe2\x80\x94s on a s\xe2\x80\x94m\xe2\x80\x94r aftern\xe2\x80\x94n,\r\nA wee be\xe2\x80\x94re the s\xe2\x80\x94n w\xe2\x80\x94nt d\xe2\x80\x94n,\r\nWhen Kitty wi\xe2\x80\x99 a braw n\xe2\x80\x94w g\xe2\x80\x94wn\r\nC\xe2\x80\x94me ow\xe2\x80\x99re the h\xe2\x80\x94lls to Gowrie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane had apprehended the singer in a moment, and looked\r\nguilty of she did not know what. Lucetta next recognized him, and more\r\nmistress of herself said archly, \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Lass of Gowrie\xe2\x80\x99 from inside of a\r\nseed-drill\xe2\x80\x94what a phenomenon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSatisfied at last with his investigation the young man stood upright,\r\nand met their eyes across the summit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are looking at the wonderful new drill,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Templeman said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\npractically it is a stupid thing\xe2\x80\x94is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, on the strength\r\nof Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid? O no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will revolutionize sowing\r\nheerabout! No more sowers flinging their seed about broadcast, so that\r\nsome falls by the wayside and some among thorns, and all that. Each\r\ngrain will go straight to its intended place, and nowhere else\r\nwhatever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the romance of the sower is gone for good,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nElizabeth-Jane, who felt herself at one with Farfrae in Bible-reading\r\nat least. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He that observeth the wind shall not sow,\xe2\x80\x99 so the Preacher\r\nsaid; but his words will not be to the point any more. How things\r\nchange!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; ay.... It must be so!\xe2\x80\x9d Donald admitted, his gaze fixing itself on\r\na blank point far away. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the machines are already very common in\r\nthe East and North of England,\xe2\x80\x9d he added apologetically.\r\n\r\nLucetta seemed to be outside this train of sentiment, her acquaintance\r\nwith the Scriptures being somewhat limited. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the machine yours?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked of Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, becoming embarrassed and deferential at the\r\nsound of her voice, though with Elizabeth-Jane he was quite at his\r\nease. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94I merely recommended that it should be got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the silence which followed Farfrae appeared only conscious of her;\r\nto have passed from perception of Elizabeth into a brighter sphere of\r\nexistence than she appertained to. Lucetta, discerning that he was much\r\nmixed that day, partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his\r\nromantic one, said gaily to him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t forsake the machine for us,\xe2\x80\x9d and went indoors with her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nThe latter felt that she had been in the way, though why was\r\nunaccountable to her. Lucetta explained the matter somewhat by saying\r\nwhen they were again in the sitting-room\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had occasion to speak to Mr. Farfrae the other day, and so I knew\r\nhim this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta was very kind towards Elizabeth that day. Together they saw the\r\nmarket thicken, and in course of time thin away with the slow decline\r\nof the sun towards the upper end of town, its rays taking the street\r\nendways and enfilading the long thoroughfare from top to bottom. The\r\ngigs and vans disappeared one by one till there was not a vehicle in\r\nthe street. The time of the riding world was over; the pedestrian world\r\nheld sway. Field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from\r\nthe villages for their weekly shopping, and instead of a rattle of\r\nwheels and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier, there was\r\nnothing but the shuffle of many feet. All the implements were gone; all\r\nthe farmers; all the moneyed class. The character of the town\xe2\x80\x99s trading\r\nhad changed from bulk to multiplicity and pence were handled now as\r\npounds had been handled earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nLucetta and Elizabeth looked out upon this, for though it was night and\r\nthe street lamps were lighted, they had kept their shutters unclosed.\r\nIn the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father was distant with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d And having forgotten the momentary mystery of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s seeming\r\nspeech to Lucetta she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because he does not think I am\r\nrespectable. I have tried to be so more than you can imagine, but in\r\nvain! My mother\xe2\x80\x99s separation from my father was unfortunate for me. You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta seemed to wince. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\xe2\x80\x94of that kind precisely,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut you may feel a\xe2\x80\x94sense of disgrace\xe2\x80\x94shame\xe2\x80\x94in other ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever had any such feeling?\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of\xe2\x80\x94what happens sometimes\r\nwhen women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world\r\nfrom no fault of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must make them very unhappy afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes them anxious; for might not other women despise them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot altogether despise them. Yet not quite like or respect them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from\r\ninvestigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never\r\nreturned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in\r\nher first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have\r\nwished that they had never been written.\r\n\r\nThe rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made\r\nthe reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable\r\ncompanion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s as the\r\nlatter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was\r\nnourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was\r\nprinted large all over Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks and eyes to any one who could\r\nread her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and\r\nclosed the street door.\r\n\r\nA seer\xe2\x80\x99s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down\r\nby the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that\r\nthey could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\xe2\x80\x94saw\r\nher encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\xe2\x80\x94saw him wear his special\r\nlook when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was\r\nLucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of\r\nboth between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be\r\nobserved; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted\r\nwith frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the\r\nsmaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all\r\nbut themselves. This discerning silent witch had not done thinking of\r\nthese things when Lucetta came noiselessly behind her and made her\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nIt was all true as she had pictured\xe2\x80\x94she could have sworn it. Lucetta\r\nhad a heightened luminousness in her eye over and above the advanced\r\ncolour of her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Mr. Farfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth demurely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt down on the hearth and took her friend\xe2\x80\x99s hands excitedly in\r\nher own. But after all she did not say when or how she had seen him or\r\nwhat he had said.\r\n\r\nThat night she became restless; in the morning she was feverish; and at\r\nbreakfast-time she told her companion that she had something on her\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x94something which concerned a person in whom she was interested\r\nmuch. Elizabeth was earnest to listen and sympathize.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis person\xe2\x80\x94a lady\xe2\x80\x94once admired a man much\xe2\x80\x94very much,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\ntentatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were intimate\xe2\x80\x94rather. He did not think so deeply of her as she\r\ndid of him. But in an impulsive moment, purely out of reparation, he\r\nproposed to make her his wife. She agreed. But there was an unsuspected\r\nhitch in the proceedings; though she had been so far compromised with\r\nhim that she felt she could never belong to another man, as a pure\r\nmatter of conscience, even if she should wish to. After that they were\r\nmuch apart, heard nothing of each other for a long time, and she felt\r\nher life quite closed up for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94poor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe suffered much on account of him; though I should add that he could\r\nnot altogether be blamed for what had happened. At last the obstacle\r\nwhich separated them was providentially removed; and he came to marry\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the interval she\xe2\x80\x94my poor friend\xe2\x80\x94had seen a man, she liked\r\nbetter than him. Now comes the point: Could she in honour dismiss the\r\nfirst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA new man she liked better\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta, looking pained at a boy who was swinging the town\r\npump-handle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is bad! Though you must remember that she was forced\r\ninto an equivocal position with the first man by an accident\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\nwas not so well educated or refined as the second, and that she had\r\ndiscovered some qualities in the first that rendered him less desirable\r\nas a husband than she had at first thought him to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is so\r\ndifficult. It wants a Pope to settle that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prefer not to perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d Lucetta showed in her appealing tone how\r\nmuch she leant on Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Templeman,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Elizabeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Lucetta seemed relieved by the simple fact of having\r\nopened out the situation a little, and was slowly convalescent of her\r\nheadache. \xe2\x80\x9cBring me a looking-glass. How do I appear to people?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid languidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94a little worn,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Elizabeth, eyeing her as a critic eyes a\r\ndoubtful painting; fetching the glass she enabled Lucetta to survey\r\nherself in it, which Lucetta anxiously did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I wear well, as times go!\xe2\x80\x9d she observed after a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94fairly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I worst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder your eyes\xe2\x80\x94I notice a little brownness there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That is my worst place, I know. How many years more do you think\r\nI shall last before I get hopelessly plain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something curious in the way in which Elizabeth, though the\r\nyounger, had come to play the part of experienced sage in these\r\ndiscussions. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be five years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said judicially. \xe2\x80\x9cOr, with a\r\nquiet life, as many as ten. With no love you might calculate on ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable, impartial\r\nverdict. She told Elizabeth-Jane no more of the past attachment she had\r\nroughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person; and Elizabeth,\r\nwho in spite of her philosophy was very tender-hearted, sighed that\r\nnight in bed at the thought that her pretty, rich Lucetta did not treat\r\nher to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions. For\r\nby the \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x9d of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s story Elizabeth had not been beguiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nThe next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s heart was\r\nan experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent\r\ntrepidation. Conventionally speaking he conversed with both Miss\r\nTempleman and her companion; but in fact it was rather that Elizabeth\r\nsat invisible in the room. Donald appeared not to see her at all, and\r\nanswered her wise little remarks with curtly indifferent monosyllables,\r\nhis looks and faculties hanging on the woman who could boast of a more\r\nProtean variety in her phases, moods, opinions, and also principles,\r\nthan could Elizabeth. Lucetta had persisted in dragging her into the\r\ncircle; but she had remained like an awkward third point which that\r\ncircle would not touch.\r\n\r\nSusan Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s daughter bore up against the frosty ache of the\r\ntreatment, as she had borne up under worse things, and contrived as\r\nsoon as possible to get out of the inharmonious room without being\r\nmissed. The Scotchman seemed hardly the same Farfrae who had danced\r\nwith her and walked with her in a delicate poise between love and\r\nfriendship\xe2\x80\x94that period in the history of a love when alone it can be\r\nsaid to be unalloyed with pain.\r\n\r\nShe stoically looked from her bedroom window, and contemplated her fate\r\nas if it were written on the top of the church-tower hard by. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said at last, bringing down her palm upon the sill with a pat:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He_ is the second man of that story she told me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this time Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s smouldering sentiments towards Lucetta had\r\nbeen fanned into higher and higher inflammation by the circumstances of\r\nthe case. He was discovering that the young woman for whom he once felt\r\na pitying warmth which had been almost chilled out of him by\r\nreflection, was, when now qualified with a slight inaccessibility and a\r\nmore matured beauty, the very being to make him satisfied with life.\r\nDay after day proved to him, by her silence, that it was no use to\r\nthink of bringing her round by holding aloof; so he gave in, and called\r\nupon her again, Elizabeth-Jane being absent.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room to her with a heavy tread of some awkwardness, his\r\nstrong, warm gaze upon her\xe2\x80\x94like the sun beside the moon in comparison\r\nwith Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s modest look\xe2\x80\x94and with something of a hail-fellow bearing,\r\nas, indeed, was not unnatural. But she seemed so transubstantiated by\r\nher change of position, and held out her hand to him in such cool\r\nfriendship, that he became deferential, and sat down with a perceptible\r\nloss of power. He understood but little of fashion in dress, yet enough\r\nto feel himself inadequate in appearance beside her whom he had\r\nhitherto been dreaming of as almost his property. She said something\r\nvery polite about his being good enough to call. This caused him to\r\nrecover balance. He looked her oddly in the face, losing his awe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course I have called, Lucetta,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that\r\nnonsense mean? You know I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have helped myself if I had\r\nwished\xe2\x80\x94that is, if I had any kindness at all. I\xe2\x80\x99ve called to say that I\r\nam ready, as soon as custom will permit, to give you my name in return\r\nfor your devotion and what you lost by it in thinking too little of\r\nyourself and too much of me; to say that you can fix the day or month,\r\nwith my full consent, whenever in your opinion it would be seemly: you\r\nknow more of these things than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is full early yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said evasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; I suppose it is. But you know, Lucetta, I felt directly my\r\npoor ill-used Susan died, and when I could not bear the idea of\r\nmarrying again, that after what had happened between us it was my duty\r\nnot to let any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights.\r\nStill, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call in a hurry, because\xe2\x80\x94well, you can guess how this\r\nmoney you\xe2\x80\x99ve come into made me feel.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice slowly fell; he was\r\nconscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not\r\nobservable in the street. He looked about the room at the novel\r\nhangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my life I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know such furniture as this could be bought in\r\nCasterbridge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor can it be,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cNor will it till fifty years more of\r\ncivilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four\r\nhorses to get it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes\r\nmy beaming towards you rather awkward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter\r\ninto this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will\r\nbecome it more.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so\r\nfervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly obliged to you for all that,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, rather with an\r\nair of speaking ritual. The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived,\r\nand Henchard showed chagrin at once\xe2\x80\x94nobody was more quick to show that\r\nthan he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be obliged or not for\xe2\x80\x99t. Though the things I say may not have\r\nthe polish of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve lately learnt to expect for the first time in\r\nyour life, they are real, my lady Lucetta.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s rather a rude way of speaking to me,\xe2\x80\x9d pouted Lucetta, with\r\nstormy eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Henchard hotly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there, there, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto quarrel with \xe2\x80\x99ee. I come with an honest proposal for silencing your\r\nJersey enemies, and you ought to be thankful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you speak so!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, firing quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cKnowing that my\r\nonly crime was the indulging in a foolish girl\xe2\x80\x99s passion for you with\r\ntoo little regard for correctness, and that I was what I call innocent\r\nall the time they called me guilty, you ought not to be so cutting! I\r\nsuffered enough at that worrying time, when you wrote to tell me of\r\nyour wife\xe2\x80\x99s return and my consequent dismissal, and if I am a little\r\nindependent now, surely the privilege is due to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not by what is, in this life, but by\r\nwhat appears, that you are judged; and I therefore think you ought to\r\naccept me\xe2\x80\x94for your own good name\xe2\x80\x99s sake. What is known in your native\r\nJersey may get known here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you keep on about Jersey! I am English!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Well, what do you say to my proposal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the first time in their acquaintance Lucetta had the move; and yet\r\nshe was backward. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the present let things be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with some\r\nembarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9cTreat me as an acquaintance, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll treat you as one.\r\nTime will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped; and he said nothing to fill the gap for\r\nawhile, there being no pressure of half acquaintance to drive them into\r\nspeech if they were not minded for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way the wind blows, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last grimly, nodding\r\nan affirmative to his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nA yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few\r\ninstants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay\r\nfrom the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s name. Beside it\r\nrode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s face became\xe2\x80\x94as a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an\r\napparition.\r\n\r\nA turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret\r\nof her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in\r\nestimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not\r\nnote the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it of women!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity;\r\nwhile Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the\r\ntruth that she asked him to be in no hurry. Bringing him some apples\r\nshe insisted upon paring one for him.\r\n\r\nHe would not take it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; such is not for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said drily, and\r\nmoved to the door. At going out he turned his eye upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet now you are here you won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say to my offer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa\r\nand jumped up again in a fit of desperation. \xe2\x80\x9cI will love him!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried passionately; \xe2\x80\x9cas for _him_\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s hot-tempered and stern, and it\r\nwould be madness to bind myself to him knowing that. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be a slave\r\nto the past\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll love where I choose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed\r\nher capable of aiming higher than Farfrae. But Lucetta reasoned\r\nnothing: she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been\r\nearlier associated; she had no relatives left; and with native\r\nlightness of heart took kindly to what fate offered.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane, surveying the position of Lucetta between her two\r\nlovers from the crystalline sphere of a straightforward mind, did not\r\nfail to perceive that her father, as she called him, and Donald Farfrae\r\nbecame more desperately enamoured of her friend every day. On Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside it was the unforced passion of youth. On Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nartificially stimulated coveting of maturer age.\r\n\r\nThe pain she experienced from the almost absolute obliviousness to her\r\nexistence that was shown by the pair of them became at times half\r\ndissipated by her sense of its humourousness. When Lucetta had pricked\r\nher finger they were as deeply concerned as if she were dying; when she\r\nherself had been seriously sick or in danger they uttered a\r\nconventional word of sympathy at the news, and forgot all about it\r\nimmediately. But, as regarded Henchard, this perception of hers also\r\ncaused her some filial grief; she could not help asking what she had\r\ndone to be neglected so, after the professions of solicitude he had\r\nmade. As regarded Farfrae, she thought, after honest reflection, that\r\nit was quite natural. What was she beside Lucetta?\xe2\x80\x94as one of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmeaner beauties of the night,\xe2\x80\x9d when the moon had risen in the skies.\r\n\r\nShe had learnt the lesson of renunciation, and was as familiar with the\r\nwreck of each day\xe2\x80\x99s wishes as with the diurnal setting of the sun. If\r\nher earthly career had taught her few book philosophies it had at least\r\nwell practised her in this. Yet her experience had consisted less in a\r\nseries of pure disappointments than in a series of substitutions.\r\nContinually it had happened that what she had desired had not been\r\ngranted her, and that what had been granted her she had not desired. So\r\nshe viewed with an approach to equanimity the now cancelled days when\r\nDonald had been her undeclared lover, and wondered what unwished-for\r\nthing Heaven might send her in place of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nIt chanced that on a fine spring morning Henchard and Farfrae met in\r\nthe chestnut-walk which ran along the south wall of the town. Each had\r\njust come out from his early breakfast, and there was not another soul\r\nnear. Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta, sent in answer to a\r\nnote from him, in which she made some excuse for not immediately\r\ngranting him a second interview that he had desired.\r\n\r\nDonald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on\r\ntheir present constrained terms; neither would he pass him in scowling\r\nsilence. He nodded, and Henchard did the same. They receded from each\r\nother several paces when a voice cried \xe2\x80\x9cFarfrae!\xe2\x80\x9d It was Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho stood regarding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, as if it were the presence of the\r\nthought and not of the man which made him speak, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you remember my\r\nstory of that second woman\xe2\x80\x94who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember my telling \xe2\x80\x99ee how it all began and how it ended?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have offered to marry her now that I can; but she won\xe2\x80\x99t marry\r\nme. Now what would you think of her\xe2\x80\x94I put it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye owe her nothing more now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, and went on.\r\n\r\nThat he had looked up from a letter to ask his questions completely\r\nshut out from Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s mind all vision of Lucetta as the culprit.\r\nIndeed, her present position was so different from that of the young\r\nwoman of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s story as of itself to be sufficient to blind him\r\nabsolutely to her identity. As for Henchard, he was reassured by\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s words and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his\r\nmind. They were not those of a conscious rival.\r\n\r\nYet that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded. He\r\ncould feel it in the air around Lucetta, see it in the turn of her pen.\r\nThere was an antagonistic force in exercise, so that when he had tried\r\nto hang near her he seemed standing in a refluent current. That it was\r\nnot innate caprice he was more and more certain. Her windows gleamed as\r\nif they did not want him; her curtains seem to hang slily, as if they\r\nscreened an ousting presence. To discover whose presence that\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94whether really Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s after all, or another\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he exerted himself\r\nto the utmost to see her again; and at length succeeded.\r\n\r\nAt the interview, when she offered him tea, he made it a point to\r\nlaunch a cautious inquiry if she knew Mr. Farfrae.\r\n\r\nO yes, she knew him, she declared; she could not help knowing almost\r\neverybody in Casterbridge, living in such a gazebo over the centre and\r\narena of the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasant young fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe both know him,\xe2\x80\x9d said kind Elizabeth-Jane, to relieve her\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s divined embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door; literally, three full knocks and a\r\nlittle one at the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat kind of knock means half-and-half\xe2\x80\x94somebody between gentle and\r\nsimple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corn-merchant to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\r\ntherefore if it is he.\xe2\x80\x9d In a few seconds surely enough Donald walked\r\nin.\r\n\r\nLucetta was full of little fidgets and flutters, which increased\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions without affording any special proof of their\r\ncorrectness. He was well-nigh ferocious at the sense of the queer\r\nsituation in which he stood towards this woman. One who had reproached\r\nhim for deserting her when calumniated, who had urged claims upon his\r\nconsideration on that account, who had lived waiting for him, who at\r\nthe first decent opportunity had come to ask him to rectify, by making\r\nher his, the false position into which she had placed herself for his\r\nsake; such she had been. And now he sat at her tea-table eager to gain\r\nher attention, and in his amatory rage feeling the other man present to\r\nbe a villain, just as any young fool of a lover might feel.\r\n\r\nThey sat stiffly side by side at the darkening table, like some Tuscan\r\npainting of the two disciples supping at Emmaus. Lucetta, forming the\r\nthird and haloed figure, was opposite them; Elizabeth-Jane, being out\r\nof the game, and out of the group, could observe all from afar, like\r\nthe evangelist who had to write it down: that there were long spaces of\r\ntaciturnity, when all exterior circumstances were subdued to the touch\r\nof spoons and china, the click of a heel on the pavement under the\r\nwindow, the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart, the whistling of the\r\ncarter, the gush of water into householders\xe2\x80\x99 buckets at the town-pump\r\nopposite, the exchange of greetings among their neighbours, and the\r\nrattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore bread-and-butter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta to Henchard and Farfrae equally,\r\nholding out between them a plateful of long slices. Henchard took a\r\nslice by one end and Donald by the other; each feeling certain he was\r\nthe man meant; neither let go, and the slice came in two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I am so sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucetta, with a nervous titter. Farfrae tried\r\nto laugh; but he was too much in love to see the incident in any but a\r\ntragic light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ridiculous of all three of them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth to herself.\r\n\r\nHenchard left the house with a ton of conjecture, though without a\r\ngrain of proof, that the counterattraction was Farfrae; and therefore\r\nhe would not make up his mind. Yet to Elizabeth-Jane it was plain as\r\nthe town-pump that Donald and Lucetta were incipient lovers. More than\r\nonce, in spite of her care, Lucetta had been unable to restrain her\r\nglance from flitting across into Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s eyes like a bird to its\r\nnest. But Henchard was constructed upon too large a scale to discern\r\nsuch minuti\xc3\xa6 as these by an evening light, which to him were as the\r\nnotes of an insect that lie above the compass of the human ear.\r\n\r\nBut he was disturbed. And the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was\r\nso much superadded to the palpable rivalry of their business lives. To\r\nthe coarse materiality of that rivalry it added an inflaming soul.\r\n\r\nThe thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by Henchard\r\nsending for Jopp, the manager originally displaced by Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival. Henchard had frequently met this man about the streets,\r\nobserved that his clothing spoke of neediness, heard that he lived in\r\nMixen Lane\xe2\x80\x94a back slum of the town, the _pis aller_ of Casterbridge\r\ndomiciliation\xe2\x80\x94itself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when\r\nhe would not stick at trifles.\r\n\r\nJopp came after dark, by the gates of the storeyard, and felt his way\r\nthrough the hay and straw to the office where Henchard sat in solitude\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am again out of a foreman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corn-factor. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you in a\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much as a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJopp named his price, which was very moderate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen can you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this hour and moment, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp, who, standing hands-pocketed\r\nat the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat\r\nto scarecrow green, had regularly watched Henchard in the market-place,\r\nmeasured him, and learnt him, by virtue of the power which the still\r\nman has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows\r\nhimself. Jopp too, had had a convenient experience; he was the only one\r\nin Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close-lipped Elizabeth who\r\nknew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from\r\nBath. \xe2\x80\x9cI know Jersey too, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWas living there when you\r\nused to do business that way. O yes\xe2\x80\x94have often seen ye there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Very good. Then the thing is settled. The testimonials you\r\nshowed me when you first tried for\xe2\x80\x99t are sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to\r\nHenchard. Jopp said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d and stood more firmly, in the\r\nconsciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, digging his strong eyes into Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s face, \xe2\x80\x9cone\r\nthing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn-and-hay dealer in these\r\nparts. The Scotchman, who\xe2\x80\x99s taking the town trade so bold into his\r\nhands, must be cut out. D\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? We two can\xe2\x80\x99t live side by\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s clear and certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy fair competition I mean, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard continued. \xe2\x80\x9cBut as\r\nhard, keen, and unflinching as fair\xe2\x80\x94rather more so. By such a desperate\r\nbid against him for the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 custom as will grind him into the\r\nground\xe2\x80\x94starve him out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve capital, mind ye, and I can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all that way of thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said the new foreman. Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s dislike of\r\nFarfrae as the man who had once ursurped his place, while it made him a\r\nwilling tool, made him, at the same time, commercially as unsafe a\r\ncolleague as Henchard could have chosen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he must have some glass that he\r\nsees next year in. He has such a knack of making everything bring him\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s deep beyond all honest men\xe2\x80\x99s discerning, but we must make him\r\nshallower. We\xe2\x80\x99ll undersell him, and over-buy him, and so snuff him\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey then entered into specific details of the process by which this\r\nwould be accomplished, and parted at a late hour.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane heard by accident that Jopp had been engaged by her\r\nstepfather. She was so fully convinced that he was not the right man\r\nfor the place that, at the risk of making Henchard angry, she expressed\r\nher apprehension to him when they met. But it was done to no purpose.\r\nHenchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff.\r\n\r\nThe season\xe2\x80\x99s weather seemed to favour their scheme. The time was in the\r\nyears immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized the\r\ntrade in grain; when still, as from the earliest ages, the wheat\r\nquotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest.\r\nA bad harvest, or the prospect of one, would double the price of corn\r\nin a few weeks; and the promise of a good yield would lower it as\r\nrapidly. Prices were like the roads of the period, steep in gradient,\r\nreflecting in their phases the local conditions, without engineering,\r\nlevellings, or averages.\r\n\r\nThe farmer\xe2\x80\x99s income was ruled by the wheat-crop within his own horizon,\r\nand the wheat-crop by the weather. Thus in person, he became a sort of\r\nflesh-barometer, with feelers always directed to the sky and wind\r\naround him. The local atmosphere was everything to him; the atmospheres\r\nof other countries a matter of indifference. The people, too, who were\r\nnot farmers, the rural multitude, saw in the god of the weather a more\r\nimportant personage than they do now. Indeed, the feeling of the\r\npeasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in\r\nthese equable days. Their impulse was well-nigh to prostrate themselves\r\nin lamentation before untimely rains and tempests, which came as the\r\nAlastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor.\r\n\r\nAfter midsummer they watched the weather-cocks as men waiting in\r\nantechambers watch the lackey. Sun elated them; quiet rain sobered\r\nthem; weeks of watery tempest stupefied them. That aspect of the sky\r\nwhich they now regard as disagreeable they then beheld as maleficent.\r\n\r\nIt was June, and the weather was very unfavourable. Casterbridge, being\r\nas it were the bell-board on which all the adjacent hamlets and\r\nvillages sounded their notes, was decidedly dull. Instead of new\r\narticles in the shop-windows those that had been rejected in the\r\nforegoing summer were brought out again; superseded reap-hooks,\r\nbadly-shaped rakes, shop-worn leggings, and time-stiffened water-tights\r\nreappeared, furbished up as near to new as possible.\r\n\r\nHenchard, backed by Jopp, read a disastrous garnering, and resolved to\r\nbase his strategy against Farfrae upon that reading. But before acting\r\nhe wished\xe2\x80\x94what so many have wished\xe2\x80\x94that he could know for certain what\r\nwas at present only strong probability. He was superstitious\xe2\x80\x94as such\r\nhead-strong natures often are\xe2\x80\x94and he nourished in his mind an idea\r\nbearing on the matter; an idea he shrank from disclosing even to Jopp.\r\n\r\nIn a lonely hamlet a few miles from the town\xe2\x80\x94so lonely that what are\r\ncalled lonely villages were teeming by comparison\xe2\x80\x94there lived a man of\r\ncurious repute as a forecaster or weather-prophet. The way to his house\r\nwas crooked and miry\xe2\x80\x94even difficult in the present unpropitious season.\r\nOne evening when it was raining so heavily that ivy and laurel\r\nresounded like distant musketry, and an out-door man could be excused\r\nfor shrouding himself to his ears and eyes, such a shrouded figure on\r\nfoot might have been perceived travelling in the direction of the\r\nhazel-copse which dripped over the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s cot. The turnpike-road\r\nbecame a lane, the lane a cart-track, the cart-track a bridle-path, the\r\nbridle-path a foot-way, the foot-way overgrown. The solitary walker\r\nslipped here and there, and stumbled over the natural springes formed\r\nby the brambles, till at length he reached the house, which, with its\r\ngarden, was surrounded with a high, dense hedge. The cottage,\r\ncomparatively a large one, had been built of mud by the occupier\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhands, and thatched also by himself. Here he had always lived, and here\r\nit was assumed he would die.\r\n\r\nHe existed on unseen supplies; for it was an anomalous thing that while\r\nthere was hardly a soul in the neighbourhood but affected to laugh at\r\nthis man\xe2\x80\x99s assertions, uttering the formula, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith full assurance on the surface of their faces, very few of them\r\nwere unbelievers in their secret hearts. Whenever they consulted him\r\nthey did it \xe2\x80\x9cfor a fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d When they paid him they said, \xe2\x80\x9cJust a trifle\r\nfor Christmas,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCandlemas,\xe2\x80\x9d as the case might be.\r\n\r\nHe would have preferred more honesty in his clients, and less sham\r\nridicule; but fundamental belief consoled him for superficial irony. As\r\nstated, he was enabled to live; people supported him with their backs\r\nturned. He was sometimes astonished that men could profess so little\r\nand believe so much at his house, when at church they professed so much\r\nand believed so little.\r\n\r\nBehind his back he was called \xe2\x80\x9cWide-oh,\xe2\x80\x9d on account of his reputation;\r\nto his face \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x9d Fall.\r\n\r\nThe hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance, and a door\r\nwas inserted as in a wall. Outside the door the tall traveller stopped,\r\nbandaged his face with a handkerchief as if he were suffering from\r\ntoothache, and went up the path. The window shutters were not closed,\r\nand he could see the prophet within, preparing his supper.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the knock Fall came to the door, candle in hand. The\r\nvisitor stepped back a little from the light, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I speak to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d in significant tones. The other\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to come in was\r\nresponded to by the country formula, \xe2\x80\x9cThis will do, thank \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d after\r\nwhich the householder had no alternative but to come out. He placed the\r\ncandle on the corner of the dresser, took his hat from a nail, and\r\njoined the stranger in the porch, shutting the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve long heard that you can\xe2\x80\x94do things of a sort?\xe2\x80\x9d began the other,\r\nrepressing his individuality as much as he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe so, Mr. Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the weather-caster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94why do you call me that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the visitor with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s your name. Feeling you\xe2\x80\x99d come I\xe2\x80\x99ve waited for \xe2\x80\x99ee; and\r\nthinking you might be leery from your walk I laid two supper\r\nplates\xe2\x80\x94look ye here.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw open the door and disclosed the\r\nsupper-table, at which appeared a second chair, knife and fork, plate\r\nand mug, as he had declared.\r\n\r\nHenchard felt like Saul at his reception by Samuel; he remained in\r\nsilence for a few moments, then throwing off the disguise of frigidity\r\nwhich he had hitherto preserved he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen I have not come in\r\nvain.... Now, for instance, can ye charm away warts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCure the evil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99ve done\xe2\x80\x94with consideration\xe2\x80\x94if they will wear the toad-bag by\r\nnight as well as by day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForecast the weather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith labour and time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a crownpiece. Now, what is the\r\nharvest fortnight to be? When can I know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve worked it out already, and you can know at once.\xe2\x80\x9d (The fact was\r\nthat five farmers had already been there on the same errand from\r\ndifferent parts of the country.) \xe2\x80\x9cBy the sun, moon, and stars, by the\r\nclouds, the winds, the trees, and grass, the candle-flame and swallows,\r\nthe smell of the herbs; likewise by the cats\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, the ravens, the\r\nleeches, the spiders, and the dungmixen, the last fortnight in August\r\nwill be\xe2\x80\x94rain and tempest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not certain, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs one can be in a world where all\xe2\x80\x99s unsure. \xe2\x80\x99Twill be more like\r\nliving in Revelations this autumn than in England. Shall I sketch it\r\nout for \xe2\x80\x99ee in a scheme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t altogether believe in forecasts,\r\ncome to second thoughts on such. But I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis quite understood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wide-oh, without a\r\nsound of scorn. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have given me a crown because you\xe2\x80\x99ve one too many.\r\nBut won\xe2\x80\x99t you join me at supper, now \xe2\x80\x99tis waiting and all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard would gladly have joined; for the savour of the stew had\r\nfloated from the cottage into the porch with such appetizing\r\ndistinctness that the meat, the onions, the pepper, and the herbs could\r\nbe severally recognized by his nose. But as sitting down to hob-and-nob\r\nthere would have seemed to mark him too implicitly as the\r\nweather-caster\xe2\x80\x99s apostle, he declined, and went his way.\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday Henchard bought grain to such an enormous extent that\r\nthere was quite a talk about his purchases among his neighbours the\r\nlawyer, the wine merchant, and the doctor; also on the next, and on all\r\navailable days. When his granaries were full to choking all the\r\nweather-cocks of Casterbridge creaked and set their faces in another\r\ndirection, as if tired of the south-west. The weather changed; the\r\nsunlight, which had been like tin for weeks, assumed the hues of topaz.\r\nThe temperament of the welkin passed from the phlegmatic to the\r\nsanguine; an excellent harvest was almost a certainty; and as a\r\nconsequence prices rushed down.\r\n\r\nAll these transformations, lovely to the outsider, to the wrong-headed\r\ncorn-dealer were terrible. He was reminded of what he had well known\r\nbefore, that a man might gamble upon the square green areas of fields\r\nas readily as upon those of a card-room.\r\n\r\nHenchard had backed bad weather, and apparently lost. He had mistaken\r\nthe turn of the flood for the turn of the ebb. His dealings had been so\r\nextensive that settlement could not long be postponed, and to settle he\r\nwas obliged to sell off corn that he had bought only a few weeks before\r\nat figures higher by many shillings a quarter. Much of the corn he had\r\nnever seen; it had not even been moved from the ricks in which it lay\r\nstacked miles away. Thus he lost heavily.\r\n\r\nIn the blaze of an early August day he met Farfrae in the market-place.\r\nFarfrae knew of his dealings (though he did not guess their intended\r\nbearing on himself) and commiserated him; for since their exchange of\r\nwords in the South Walk they had been on stiffly speaking terms.\r\nHenchard for the moment appeared to resent the sympathy; but he\r\nsuddenly took a careless turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, no, no!\xe2\x80\x94nothing serious, man!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried with fierce gaiety. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nthings always happen, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? I know it has been said that figures\r\nhave touched me tight lately; but is that anything rare? The case is\r\nnot so bad as folk make out perhaps. And dammy, a man must be a fool to\r\nmind the common hazards of trade!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had to enter the Casterbridge Bank that day for reasons which\r\nhad never before sent him there\xe2\x80\x94and to sit a long time in the partners\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroom with a constrained bearing. It was rumoured soon after that much\r\nreal property as well as vast stores of produce, which had stood in\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s name in the town and neighbourhood, was actually the\r\npossession of his bankers.\r\n\r\nComing down the steps of the bank he encountered Jopp. The gloomy\r\ntransactions just completed within had added fever to the original\r\nsting of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy that morning, which Henchard fancied might\r\nbe a satire disguised so that Jopp met with anything but a bland\r\nreception. The latter was in the act of taking off his hat to wipe his\r\nforehead, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cA fine hot day,\xe2\x80\x9d to an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can wipe and wipe, and say, \xe2\x80\x98A fine hot day,\xe2\x80\x99 can ye!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nHenchard in a savage undertone, imprisoning Jopp between himself and\r\nthe bank wall. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for your blasted advice it might have\r\nbeen a fine day enough! Why did ye let me go on, hey?\xe2\x80\x94when a word of\r\ndoubt from you or anybody would have made me think twice! For you can\r\nnever be sure of weather till \xe2\x80\x99tis past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy advice, sir, was to do what you thought best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA useful fellow! And the sooner you help somebody else in that way the\r\nbetter!\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard continued his address to Jopp in similar terms till\r\nit ended in Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal there and then, Henchard turning upon his\r\nheel and leaving him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be sorry for this, sir; sorry as a man can be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp,\r\nstanding pale, and looking after the corn-merchant as he disappeared in\r\nthe crowd of market-men hard by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nIt was the eve of harvest. Prices being low Farfrae was buying. As was\r\nusual, after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers\r\nhad flown to the other extreme, and (in Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s opinion) were selling\r\noff too recklessly\xe2\x80\x94calculating with just a trifle too much certainty\r\nupon an abundant yield. So he went on buying old corn at its\r\ncomparatively ridiculous price: for the produce of the previous year,\r\nthough not large, had been of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nWhen Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way, and got rid\r\nof his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss, the harvest began.\r\nThere were three days of excellent weather, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if that\r\ncurst conjuror should be right after all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that no sooner had the sickles begun to play than the\r\natmosphere suddenly felt as if cress would grow in it without other\r\nnourishment. It rubbed people\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks like damp flannel when they\r\nwalked abroad. There was a gusty, high, warm wind; isolated raindrops\r\nstarred the window-panes at remote distances: the sunlight would flap\r\nout like a quickly opened fan, throw the pattern of the window upon the\r\nfloor of the room in a milky, colourless shine, and withdraw as\r\nsuddenly as it had appeared.\r\n\r\nFrom that day and hour it was clear that there was not to be so\r\nsuccessful an ingathering after all. If Henchard had only waited long\r\nenough he might at least have avoided loss though he had not made a\r\nprofit. But the momentum of his character knew no patience. At this\r\nturn of the scales he remained silent. The movements of his mind seemed\r\nto tend to the thought that some power was working against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself with eerie misgiving; \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if it can\r\nbe that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me, or stirring an\r\nunholy brew to confound me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in such power; and yet\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nif they should ha\xe2\x80\x99 been doing it!\xe2\x80\x9d Even he could not admit that the\r\nperpetrator, if any, might be Farfrae. These isolated hours of\r\nsuperstition came to Henchard in time of moody depression, when all his\r\npractical largeness of view had oozed out of him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Donald Farfrae prospered. He had purchased in so depressed a\r\nmarket that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to\r\npile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be Mayor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. It was indeed hard that the\r\nspeaker should, of all others, have to follow the triumphal chariot of\r\nthis man to the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men.\r\n\r\nSeptember night-shades had fallen upon Casterbridge; the clocks had\r\nstruck half-past eight, and the moon had risen. The streets of the town\r\nwere curiously silent for such a comparatively early hour. A sound of\r\njangling horse-bells and heavy wheels passed up the street. These were\r\nfollowed by angry voices outside Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s house, which led her and\r\nElizabeth-Jane to run to the windows, and pull up the blinds.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring Market House and Town Hall abutted against its next\r\nneighbour the Church except in the lower storey, where an arched\r\nthoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called Bull Stake. A\r\nstone post rose in the midst, to which the oxen had formerly been tied\r\nfor baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in\r\nthe adjoining shambles. In a corner stood the stocks.\r\n\r\nThe thoroughfare leading to this spot was now blocked by two four-horse\r\nwaggons and horses, one laden with hay-trusses, the leaders having\r\nalready passed each other, and become entangled head to tail. The\r\npassage of the vehicles might have been practicable if empty; but built\r\nup with hay to the bedroom windows as one was, it was impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have done it a\xe2\x80\x99 purpose!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s waggoner. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nhear my horses\xe2\x80\x99 bells half-a-mile such a night as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ye\xe2\x80\x99d been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a\r\ngawk-hammer way, you would have zeed me!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the wroth\r\nrepresentative of Henchard.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s man was most in the wrong, he therefore attempted to back\r\ninto the High Street. In doing this the near hind-wheel rose against\r\nthe churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over, two of\r\nthe four wheels rising in the air, and the legs of the thill horse.\r\n\r\nInstead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in\r\na fight with their fists. Before the first round was quite over\r\nHenchard came upon the spot, somebody having run for him.\r\n\r\nHenchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by\r\ncollaring one with each hand, turned to the horse that was down, and\r\nextricated him after some trouble. He then inquired into the\r\ncircumstances; and seeing the state of his waggon and its load began\r\nhotly rating Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s man.\r\n\r\nLucetta and Elizabeth-Jane had by this time run down to the street\r\ncorner, whence they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the\r\nmoon\xe2\x80\x99s rays, and passed and repassed by the forms of Henchard and the\r\nwaggoners. The women had witnessed what nobody else had seen\xe2\x80\x94the origin\r\nof the mishap; and Lucetta spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it all, Mr. Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; \xe2\x80\x9cand your man was most in the\r\nwrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard paused in his harangue and turned. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice you,\r\nMiss Templeman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMy man in the wrong? Ah, to be sure; to be\r\nsure! But I beg your pardon notwithstanding. The other\xe2\x80\x99s is the empty\r\nwaggon, and he must have been most to blame for coming on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I saw it, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I can assure you he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t trust _their_ senses!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Henchard sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you see, sir, all the women side with Farfrae\xe2\x80\x94being a damn young\r\ndand\xe2\x80\x94of the sort that he is\xe2\x80\x94one that creeps into a maid\xe2\x80\x99s heart like\r\nthe giddying worm into a sheep\xe2\x80\x99s brain\xe2\x80\x94making crooked seem straight to\r\ntheir eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion? Do\r\nyou know that I pay my attentions to her, and have for some time? Just\r\nbe careful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I. I know nothing, sir, outside eight shillings a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Mr. Farfrae is well aware of it? He\xe2\x80\x99s sharp in trade, but he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything so underhand as what you hint at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether because Lucetta heard this low dialogue, or not her white\r\nfigure disappeared from her doorway inward, and the door was shut\r\nbefore Henchard could reach it to converse with her further. This\r\ndisappointed him, for he had been sufficiently disturbed by what the\r\nman had said to wish to speak to her more closely. While pausing the\r\nold constable came up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see that nobody drives against that hay and waggon to-night,\r\nStubberd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the corn-merchant. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must bide till the morning, for\r\nall hands are in the field still. And if any coach or road-waggon wants\r\nto come along, tell \xe2\x80\x99em they must go round by the back street, and be\r\nhanged to \xe2\x80\x99em.... Any case tomorrow up in Hall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. One in number, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old flagrant female, sir, swearing and committing a nuisance in a\r\nhorrible profane manner against the church wall, sir, as if \xe2\x80\x99twere no\r\nmore than a pot-house! That\xe2\x80\x99s all, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh. The Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s out o\xe2\x80\x99 town, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to keep an eye on that\r\nhay. Good night t\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring those moments Henchard had determined to follow up Lucetta\r\nnotwithstanding her elusiveness, and he knocked for admission.\r\n\r\nThe answer he received was an expression of Miss Templeman\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow at\r\nbeing unable to see him again that evening because she had an\r\nengagement to go out.\r\n\r\nHenchard walked away from the door to the opposite side of the street,\r\nand stood by his hay in a lonely reverie, the constable having strolled\r\nelsewhere, and the horses being removed. Though the moon was not bright\r\nas yet there were no lamps lighted, and he entered the shadow of one of\r\nthe projecting jambs which formed the thoroughfare to Bull Stake; here\r\nhe watched Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nCandle-lights were flitting in and out of her bedroom, and it was\r\nobvious that she was dressing for the appointment, whatever the nature\r\nof that might be at such an hour. The lights disappeared, the clock\r\nstruck nine, and almost at the moment Farfrae came round the opposite\r\ncorner and knocked. That she had been waiting just inside for him was\r\ncertain, for she instantly opened the door herself. They went together\r\nby the way of a back lane westward, avoiding the front street; guessing\r\nwhere they were going he determined to follow.\r\n\r\nThe harvest had been so delayed by the capricious weather that whenever\r\na fine day occurred all sinews were strained to save what could be\r\nsaved of the damaged crops. On account of the rapid shortening of the\r\ndays the harvesters worked by moonlight. Hence to-night the\r\nwheat-fields abutting on the two sides of the square formed by\r\nCasterbridge town were animated by the gathering hands. Their shouts\r\nand laughter had reached Henchard at the Market House, while he stood\r\nthere waiting, and he had little doubt from the turn which Farfrae and\r\nLucetta had taken that they were bound for the spot.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole town had gone into the fields. The Casterbridge\r\npopulace still retained the primitive habit of helping one another in\r\ntime of need; and thus, though the corn belonged to the farming section\r\nof the little community\xe2\x80\x94that inhabiting the Durnover quarter\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nremainder was no less interested in the labour of getting it home.\r\n\r\nReaching the top of the lane Henchard crossed the shaded avenue on the\r\nwalls, slid down the green rampart, and stood amongst the stubble. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstitches\xe2\x80\x9d or shocks rose like tents about the yellow expanse, those in\r\nthe distance becoming lost in the moonlit hazes.\r\n\r\nHe had entered at a point removed from the scene of immediate\r\noperations; but two others had entered at that place, and he could see\r\nthem winding among the shocks. They were paying no regard to the\r\ndirection of their walk, whose vague serpentining soon began to bear\r\ndown towards Henchard. A meeting promised to be awkward, and he\r\ntherefore stepped into the hollow of the nearest shock, and sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have my leave,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucetta was saying gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Farfrae, with the unmistakable inflection of the\r\nlover pure, which Henchard had never heard in full resonance of his\r\nlips before, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are sure to be much sought after for your position,\r\nwealth, talents, and beauty. But will ye resist the temptation to be\r\none of those ladies with lots of admirers\xe2\x80\x94ay\xe2\x80\x94and be content to have\r\nonly a homely one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he the speaker?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir, what next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that what I feel will make me forget my manners!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll never have any, if you lack them only for that\r\ncause.\xe2\x80\x9d After some broken words which Henchard lost she added, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nsure you won\xe2\x80\x99t be jealous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae seemed to assure her that he would not, by taking her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are convinced, Donald, that I love nobody else,\xe2\x80\x9d she presently\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I should wish to have my own way in some things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn everything! What special thing did you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I wished not to live always in Casterbridge, for instance, upon\r\nfinding that I should not be happy here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard did not hear the reply; he might have done so and much more,\r\nbut he did not care to play the eavesdropper. They went on towards the\r\nscene of activity, where the sheaves were being handed, a dozen a\r\nminute, upon the carts and waggons which carried them away.\r\n\r\nLucetta insisted on parting from Farfrae when they drew near the\r\nworkpeople. He had some business with them, and, though he entreated\r\nher to wait a few minutes, she was inexorable, and tripped off homeward\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nHenchard thereupon left the field and followed her. His state of mind\r\nwas such that on reaching Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s door he did not knock but opened\r\nit, and walked straight up to her sitting-room, expecting to find her\r\nthere. But the room was empty, and he perceived that in his haste he\r\nhad somehow passed her on the way hither. He had not to wait many\r\nminutes, however, for he soon heard her dress rustling in the hall,\r\nfollowed by a soft closing of the door. In a moment she appeared.\r\n\r\nThe light was so low that she did not notice Henchard at first. As soon\r\nas she saw him she uttered a little cry, almost of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you frighten me so?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with a flushed face. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and you have no right to surprise me here at such\r\na time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not the right. At any rate I have the excuse.\r\nIs it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late for propriety, and might injure me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called an hour ago, and you would not see me, and I thought you were\r\nin when I called now. It is you, Lucetta, who are doing wrong. It is\r\nnot proper in \xe2\x80\x99ee to throw me over like this. I have a little matter to\r\nremind you of, which you seem to forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sank into a chair, and turned pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said through her\r\nhands, as he, standing close to the edge of her gown, began to allude\r\nto the Jersey days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you ought to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came to nothing; and through you. Then why not leave me the freedom\r\nthat I gained with such sorrow! Had I found that you proposed to marry\r\nme for pure love I might have felt bound now. But I soon learnt that\r\nyou had planned it out of mere charity\xe2\x80\x94almost as an unpleasant\r\nduty\xe2\x80\x94because I had nursed you, and compromised myself, and you thought\r\nyou must repay me. After that I did not care for you so deeply as\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come here to find me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I ought to marry you for conscience\xe2\x80\x99 sake, since you were\r\nfree, even though I\xe2\x80\x94did not like you so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why then don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent. It was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well\r\nenough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule. In feeling\r\nthis she herself forgot for the moment her partially justifying\r\nargument\xe2\x80\x94that having discovered Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s infirmities of temper, she\r\nhad some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once\r\nescaping them. The only thing she could say was, \xe2\x80\x9cI was a poor girl\r\nthen; and now my circumstances have altered, so I am hardly the same\r\nperson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true. And it makes the case awkward for me. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\ntouch your money. I am quite willing that every penny of your property\r\nshall remain to your personal use. Besides, that argument has nothing\r\nin it. The man you are thinking of is no better than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were as good as he you would leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried passionately.\r\n\r\nThis unluckily aroused Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot in honour refuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd unless you give me your promise this very night to be my\r\nwife, before a witness, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reveal our intimacy\xe2\x80\x94in common fairness to\r\nother men!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA look of resignation settled upon her. Henchard saw its bitterness;\r\nand had Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s heart been given to any other man in the world than\r\nFarfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment. But\r\nthe supplanter was the upstart (as Henchard called him) who had mounted\r\ninto prominence upon his shoulders, and he could bring himself to show\r\nno mercy.\r\n\r\nWithout another word she rang the bell, and directed that\r\nElizabeth-Jane should be fetched from her room. The latter appeared,\r\nsurprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard\r\nshe went across to him dutifully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth-Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to hear this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd turning to Lucetta: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you, or will you not, marry me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x94wish it, I must agree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say yes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a\r\npain to her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t compel\r\nher to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know\r\nthat she cannot bear much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a no\xe2\x80\x99thern simpleton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard drily. \xe2\x80\x9cThis promise\r\nwill leave him free for you, if you want him, won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim? Who are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d she said wildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94well. Then it is my mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the business is\r\nbetween me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t dwell on it just now,\xe2\x80\x9d entreated Elizabeth, holding\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to, if she promises,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, I have,\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from\r\nvery misery and faintness. \xe2\x80\x9cMichael, please don\xe2\x80\x99t argue it any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And taking up his hat he went away.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou called my father \xe2\x80\x98Michael\xe2\x80\x99 as if you knew him well? And how is it\r\nhe has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against\r\nyour will? Ah\xe2\x80\x94you have many many secrets from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you have some from me,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucetta murmured with closed eyes,\r\nlittle thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of\r\nElizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not\xe2\x80\x94do anything against you at all!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Elizabeth,\r\nkeeping in all signs of emotion till she was ready to burst. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nunderstand how my father can command you so; I don\xe2\x80\x99t sympathize with\r\nhim in it at all. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him and ask him to release you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it all be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Henchard went to the Town Hall below Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nto attend Petty Sessions, being still a magistrate for the year by\r\nvirtue of his late position as Mayor. In passing he looked up at her\r\nwindows, but nothing of her was to be seen.\r\n\r\nHenchard as a Justice of the Peace may at first seem to be an even\r\ngreater incongruity than Shallow and Silence themselves. But his rough\r\nand ready perceptions, his sledge-hammer directness, had often served\r\nhim better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple\r\nbusiness as fell to his hands in this Court. To-day Dr. Chalkfield, the\r\nMayor for the year, being absent, the corn-merchant took the big chair,\r\nhis eyes still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar\r\nfront of High-Place Hall.\r\n\r\nThere was one case only, and the offender stood before him. She was an\r\nold woman of mottled countenance, attired in a shawl of that nameless\r\ntertiary hue which comes, but cannot be made\xe2\x80\x94a hue neither tawny,\r\nrusset, hazel, nor ash; a sticky black bonnet that seemed to have been\r\nworn in the country of the Psalmist where the clouds drop fatness; and\r\nan apron that had been white in time so comparatively recent as still\r\nto contrast visibly with the rest of her clothes. The steeped aspect of\r\nthe woman as a whole showed her to be no native of the country-side or\r\neven of a country-town.\r\n\r\nShe looked cursorily at Henchard and the second magistrate, and\r\nHenchard looked at her, with a momentary pause, as if she had reminded\r\nhim indistinctly of somebody or something which passed from his mind as\r\nquickly as it had come. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what has she been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nlooking down at the charge sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is charged, sir, with the offence of disorderly female and\r\nnuisance,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Stubberd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did she do that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the other magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the church, sir, of all the horrible places in the world!\xe2\x80\x94I caught\r\nher in the act, your worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand back then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cand let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStubberd was sworn in, the magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s clerk dipped his pen, Henchard\r\nbeing no note-taker himself, and the constable began\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearing a\xe2\x80\x99 illegal noise I went down the street at twenty-five minutes\r\npast eleven P.M. on the night of the fifth instinct, Hannah Dominy.\r\nWhen I had\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go so fast, Stubberd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\nThe constable waited, with his eyes on the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s pen, till the latter\r\nstopped scratching and said, \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d Stubberd continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had\r\nproceeded to the spot I saw defendant at another spot, namely, the\r\ngutter.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, watching the point of the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s pen again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGutter, yes, Stubberd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpot measuring twelve feet nine inches or thereabouts from where I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStill careful not to outrun the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s penmanship Stubberd pulled up\r\nagain; for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him\r\nwhereabouts he broke off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI object to that,\xe2\x80\x9d spoke up the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98spot measuring twelve\r\nfeet nine or thereabouts from where I,\xe2\x80\x99 is not sound testimony!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe magistrates consulted, and the second one said that the bench was\r\nof opinion that twelve feet nine inches from a man on his oath was\r\nadmissible.\r\n\r\nStubberd, with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude at the old\r\nwoman, continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWas standing myself. She was wambling about quite\r\ndangerous to the thoroughfare and when I approached to draw near she\r\ncommitted the nuisance, and insulted me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Insulted me.\xe2\x80\x99 ...Yes, what did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said, \xe2\x80\x98Put away that dee lantern,\xe2\x80\x99 she says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays she, \xe2\x80\x98Dost hear, old turmit-head? Put away that dee lantern. I\r\nhave floored fellows a dee sight finer-looking than a dee fool like\r\nthee, you son of a bee, dee me if I haint,\xe2\x80\x99 she says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI object to that conversation!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not\r\ncapable enough to hear what I said, and what is said out of my hearing\r\nis not evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another stoppage for consultation, a book was referred to,\r\nand finally Stubberd was allowed to go on again. The truth was that the\r\nold woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates\r\nthemselves, that they were obliged to keep a sharp look-out upon their\r\nprocedure. However, when Stubberd had rambled on a little further\r\nHenchard broke out impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear any more of\r\nthem cust dees and bees! Say the words out like a man, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be so\r\nmodest, Stubberd; or else leave it alone!\xe2\x80\x9d Turning to the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nthen, have you any questions to ask him, or anything to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with a twinkle in her eye; and the clerk dipped his\r\npen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty years ago or thereabout I was selling of furmity in a tent at\r\nWeydon Fair\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Twenty years ago\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94well, that\xe2\x80\x99s beginning at the beginning; suppose\r\nyou go back to the Creation!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, not without satire.\r\n\r\nBut Henchard stared, and quite forgot what was evidence and what was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man and a woman with a little child came into my tent,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cThey sat down and had a basin apiece. Ah, Lord\xe2\x80\x99s my life! I\r\nwas of a more respectable station in the world then than I am now,\r\nbeing a land smuggler in a large way of business; and I used to season\r\nmy furmity with rum for them who asked for\xe2\x80\x99t. I did it for the man; and\r\nthen he had more and more; till at last he quarrelled with his wife,\r\nand offered to sell her to the highest bidder. A sailor came in and bid\r\nfive guineas, and paid the money, and led her away. And the man who\r\nsold his wife in that fashion is the man sitting there in the great big\r\nchair.\xe2\x80\x9d The speaker concluded by nodding her head at Henchard and\r\nfolding her arms.\r\n\r\nEverybody looked at Henchard. His face seemed strange, and in tint as\r\nif it had been powdered over with ashes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear your\r\nlife and adventures,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second magistrate sharply, filling the\r\npause which followed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked if you\xe2\x80\x99ve anything to say\r\nbearing on the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat bears on the case. It proves that he\xe2\x80\x99s no better than I, and has\r\nno right to sit there in judgment upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a concocted story,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cSo hold your tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis true.\xe2\x80\x9d The words came from Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis as true as the\r\nlight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd upon my soul it does prove that I\xe2\x80\x99m no\r\nbetter than she! And to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard\r\nfor her revenge, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave her to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sensation in the court was indescribably great. Henchard left the\r\nchair, and came out, passing through a group of people on the steps and\r\noutside that was much larger than usual; for it seemed that the old\r\nfurmity dealer had mysteriously hinted to the denizens of the lane in\r\nwhich she had been lodging since her arrival, that she knew a queer\r\nthing or two about their great local man Mr. Henchard, if she chose to\r\ntell it. This had brought them hither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta\r\nto her servant when the case was over. She had risen late, and had just\r\nlooked out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, \xe2\x80\x99tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has\r\nproved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five\r\nguineas in a booth at a fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from\r\nhis wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so\r\non, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of\r\nthat separation. The story she now heard for the first time.\r\n\r\nA gradual misery overspread Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s face as she dwelt upon the\r\npromise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was\r\nthis. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself\r\nto his care.\r\n\r\nDuring the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming\r\nin till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return\r\nindoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the\r\nseaside for a few days\xe2\x80\x94to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in\r\nthe idea, thinking a change would afford her relief. She could not help\r\nsuspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge\r\nin Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was\r\naway from home.\r\n\r\nElizabeth saw her friend depart for Port-Bredy, and took charge of\r\nHigh-Place Hall till her return. After two or three days of solitude\r\nand incessant rain Henchard called at the house. He seemed disappointed\r\nto hear of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s absence and though he nodded with outward\r\nindifference he went away handling his beard with a nettled mien.\r\n\r\nThe next day he called again. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she come now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She returned this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his stepdaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she is\r\nnot indoors. She has gone for a walk along the turnpike-road to\r\nPort-Bredy. She will be home by dusk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a few words, which only served to reveal his restless impatience,\r\nhe left the house again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX.\r\n\r\nAt this hour Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port-Bredy just as\r\nElizabeth had announced. That she had chosen for her afternoon walk the\r\nroad along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier\r\nin a carriage was curious\xe2\x80\x94if anything should be called curious in\r\nconcatenations of phenomena wherein each is known to have its\r\naccounting cause. It was the day of the chief market\xe2\x80\x94Saturday\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nFarfrae for once had been missed from his corn-stand in the dealers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroom. Nevertheless, it was known that he would be home that night\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nSunday,\xe2\x80\x9d as Casterbridge expressed it.\r\n\r\nLucetta, in continuing her walk, had at length reached the end of the\r\nranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions\r\nout of the town. This end marked a mile; and here she stopped.\r\n\r\nThe spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities, and the road, still\r\nadhering to its Roman foundation, stretched onward straight as a\r\nsurveyor\xe2\x80\x99s line till lost to sight on the most distant ridge. There was\r\nneither hedge nor tree in the prospect now, the road clinging to the\r\nstubby expanse of corn-land like a strip to an undulating garment. Near\r\nher was a barn\xe2\x80\x94the single building of any kind within her horizon.\r\n\r\nShe strained her eyes up the lessening road, but nothing appeared\r\nthereon\xe2\x80\x94not so much as a speck. She sighed one word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDonald!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nturned her face to the town for retreat.\r\n\r\nHere the case was different. A single figure was approaching\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nLucetta, in spite of her loneliness, seemed a little vexed. Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, as soon as she recognized her friend, shaped itself into\r\naffectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance. \xe2\x80\x9cI suddenly\r\nthought I would come and meet you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling.\r\n\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion. A\r\nby-road on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway at\r\nthe point where she stood, and down the track a bull was rambling\r\nuncertainly towards her and Elizabeth, who, facing the other way, did\r\nnot observe him.\r\n\r\nIn the latter quarter of each year cattle were at once the mainstay and\r\nthe terror of families about Casterbridge and its neighbourhood, where\r\nbreeding was carried on with Abrahamic success. The head of stock\r\ndriven into and out of the town at this season to be sold by the local\r\nauctioneer was very large; and all these horned beasts, in travelling\r\nto and fro, sent women and children to shelter as nothing else could\r\ndo. In the main the animals would have walked along quietly enough; but\r\nthe Casterbridge tradition was that to drive stock it was indispensable\r\nthat hideous cries, coupled with Yahoo antics and gestures, should be\r\nused, large sticks flourished, stray dogs called in, and in general\r\neverything done that was likely to infuriate the viciously disposed and\r\nterrify the mild. Nothing was commoner than for a house-holder on going\r\nout of his parlour to find his hall or passage full of little children,\r\nnursemaids, aged women, or a ladies\xe2\x80\x99 school, who apologized for their\r\npresence by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cA bull passing down street from the sale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta and Elizabeth regarded the animal in doubt, he meanwhile\r\ndrawing vaguely towards them. It was a large specimen of the breed, in\r\ncolour rich dun, though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about\r\nhis seamy sides. His horns were thick and tipped with brass; his two\r\nnostrils like the Thames Tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of\r\nyore. Between them, through the gristle of his nose, was a stout copper\r\nring, welded on, and irremovable as Gurth\xe2\x80\x99s collar of brass. To the\r\nring was attached an ash staff about a yard long, which the bull with\r\nthe motions of his head flung about like a flail.\r\n\r\nIt was not till they observed this dangling stick that the young women\r\nwere really alarmed; for it revealed to them that the bull was an old\r\none, too savage to be driven, which had in some way escaped, the staff\r\nbeing the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns\r\nat arms\xe2\x80\x99 length.\r\n\r\nThey looked round for some shelter or hiding-place, and thought of the\r\nbarn hard by. As long as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had\r\nshown some deference in his manner of approach; but no sooner did they\r\nturn their backs to seek the barn than he tossed his head and decided\r\nto thoroughly terrify them. This caused the two helpless girls to run\r\nwildly, whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge.\r\n\r\nThe barn stood behind a green slimy pond, and it was closed save as to\r\none of the usual pair of doors facing them, which had been propped open\r\nby a hurdle-stick, and for this opening they made. The interior had\r\nbeen cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end, where\r\nthere was a stack of dry clover. Elizabeth-Jane took in the situation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must climb up there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nBut before they had even approached it they heard the bull scampering\r\nthrough the pond without, and in a second he dashed into the barn,\r\nknocking down the hurdle-stake in passing; the heavy door slammed\r\nbehind him; and all three were imprisoned in the barn together. The\r\nmistaken creature saw them, and stalked towards the end of the barn\r\ninto which they had fled. The girls doubled so adroitly that their\r\npursuer was against the wall when the fugitives were already half way\r\nto the other end. By the time that his length would allow him to turn\r\nand follow them thither they had crossed over; thus the pursuit went\r\non, the hot air from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco, and\r\nnot a moment being attainable by Elizabeth or Lucetta in which to open\r\nthe door. What might have happened had their situation continued cannot\r\nbe said; but in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted their\r\nadversary\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and a man appeared. He ran forward towards the\r\nleading-staff, seized it, and wrenched the animal\xe2\x80\x99s head as if he would\r\nsnap it off. The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck\r\nseemed to have lost its stiffness and to become half-paralyzed, whilst\r\nthe nose dropped blood. The premeditated human contrivance of the\r\nnose-ring was too cunning for impulsive brute force, and the creature\r\nflinched.\r\n\r\nThe man was seen in the partial gloom to be large-framed and\r\nunhesitating. He led the bull to the door, and the light revealed\r\nHenchard. He made the bull fast without, and re-entered to the succour\r\nof Lucetta; for he had not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed on to\r\nthe clover-heap. Lucetta was hysterical, and Henchard took her in his\r\narms and carried her to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94have saved me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, as soon as she could speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have returned your kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou once saved\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94comes it to be you\xe2\x80\x94you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, not heeding his reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came out here to look for you. I have been wanting to tell you\r\nsomething these two or three days; but you have been away, and I could\r\nnot. Perhaps you cannot talk now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94no! Where is Elizabeth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the missing one cheerfully; and without waiting for\r\nthe ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the clover-stack to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nHenchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth-Jane on the\r\nother, they went slowly along the rising road. They had reached the top\r\nand were descending again when Lucetta, now much recovered, recollected\r\nthat she had dropped her muff in the barn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it at all, as I am\r\nnot tired as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d She thereupon hastened down again to the barn,\r\nthe others pursuing their way.\r\n\r\nElizabeth soon found the muff, such an article being by no means small\r\nat that time. Coming out she paused to look for a moment at the bull,\r\nnow rather to be pitied with his bleeding nose, having perhaps rather\r\nintended a practical joke than a murder. Henchard had secured him by\r\njamming the staff into the hinge of the barn-door, and wedging it there\r\nwith a stake. At length she turned to hasten onward after her\r\ncontemplation, when she saw a green-and-black gig approaching from the\r\ncontrary direction, the vehicle being driven by Farfrae.\r\n\r\nHis presence here seemed to explain Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s walk that way. Donald saw\r\nher, drew up, and was hastily made acquainted with what had occurred.\r\nAt Elizabeth-Jane mentioning how greatly Lucetta had been jeopardized,\r\nhe exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity\r\nfrom any she had seen in him before. He became so absorbed in the\r\ncircumstance that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was\r\ndoing to think of helping her up beside him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone on with Mr. Henchard, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He is taking her home. They are almost there by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are sure she can get home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane was quite sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour stepfather saved her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEntirely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae checked his horse\xe2\x80\x99s pace; she guessed why. He was thinking that\r\nit would be best not to intrude on the other two just now. Henchard had\r\nsaved Lucetta, and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper\r\naffection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise.\r\n\r\nThe immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more\r\nembarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover; but soon the two\r\nfigures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town. The\r\nface of the woman was frequently turned back, but Farfrae did not whip\r\non the horse. When these reached the town walls Henchard and his\r\ncompanion had disappeared down the street; Farfrae set down\r\nElizabeth-Jane on her expressing a particular wish to alight there, and\r\ndrove round to the stables at the back of his lodgings.\r\n\r\nOn this account he entered the house through his garden, and going up\r\nto his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state, his\r\nboxes being hauled out upon the landing, and his bookcase standing in\r\nthree pieces. These phenomena, however, seemed to cause him not the\r\nleast surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will everything be sent up?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the\r\nmistress of the house, who was superintending.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid not before eight, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see we wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware\r\ntill this morning that you were going to move, or we could have been\r\nforwarder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94well, never mind, never mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae cheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nwill do well enough if it be not later. Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t ye be standing here\r\ntalking, or it will be twelve, I doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus speaking he went out by\r\nthe front door and up the street.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval Henchard and Lucetta had had experiences of a\r\ndifferent kind. After Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s departure for the muff the\r\ncorn-merchant opened himself frankly, holding her hand within his arm,\r\nthough she would fain have withdrawn it. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Lucetta, I have been\r\nvery, very anxious to see you these two or three days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cever\r\nsince I saw you last! I have thought over the way I got your promise\r\nthat night. You said to me, \xe2\x80\x98If I were a man I should not insist.\xe2\x80\x99 That\r\ncut me deep. I felt that there was some truth in it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nmake you wretched; and to marry me just now would do that as nothing\r\nelse could\xe2\x80\x94it is but too plain. Therefore I agree to an indefinite\r\nengagement\xe2\x80\x94to put off all thought of marriage for a year or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94can I do nothing of a different kind?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nfull of gratitude to you\xe2\x80\x94you have saved my life. And your care of me is\r\nlike coals of fire on my head! I am a monied person now. Surely I can\r\ndo something in return for your goodness\xe2\x80\x94something practical?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard remained in thought. He had evidently not expected this.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing you might do, Lucetta,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not exactly\r\nof that kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen of what kind is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked with renewed misgiving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you a secret to ask it.\xe2\x80\x94You may have heard that I have\r\nbeen unlucky this year? I did what I have never done before\xe2\x80\x94speculated\r\nrashly; and I lost. That\xe2\x80\x99s just put me in a strait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would wish me to advance some money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, almost in anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the man to sponge on\r\na woman, even though she may be so nearly my own as you. No, Lucetta;\r\nwhat you can do is this and it would save me. My great creditor is\r\nGrower, and it is at his hands I shall suffer if at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s; while a\r\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x99s forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull\r\nthrough. This may be got out of him in one way\xe2\x80\x94that you would let it be\r\nknown to him that you are my intended\xe2\x80\x94that we are to be quietly married\r\nin the next fortnight.\xe2\x80\x94Now stop, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard all! Let him have\r\nthis story, without, of course, any prejudice to the fact that the\r\nactual engagement between us is to be a long one. Nobody else need\r\nknow: you could go with me to Mr. Grower and just let me speak to \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nbefore him as if we were on such terms. We\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him to keep it\r\nsecret. He will willingly wait then. At the fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s end I shall be\r\nable to face him; and I can coolly tell him all is postponed between us\r\nfor a year or two. Not a soul in the town need know how you\xe2\x80\x99ve helped\r\nme. Since you wish to be of use, there\xe2\x80\x99s your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt being now what the people called the \xe2\x80\x9cpinking in\xe2\x80\x9d of the day, that\r\nis, the quarter-hour just before dusk, he did not at first observe the\r\nresult of his own words upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, and the dryness of her lips was\r\nrepresented in her voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is such a little thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a deep reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cLess\r\nthan you have offered\xe2\x80\x94just the beginning of what you have so lately\r\npromised! I could have told him as much myself, but he would not have\r\nbelieved me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not because I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94it is because I absolutely can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith rising distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are provoking!\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough to make me force you\r\nto carry out at once what you have promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted desperately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? When I have only within these few minutes released you from your\r\npromise to do the thing offhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94he was a witness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWitness? Of what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t upbraid me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWitness of my marriage\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Grower was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. With Mr. Farfrae. O Michael! I am already his wife. We were\r\nmarried this week at Port-Bredy. There were reasons against our doing\r\nit here. Mr. Grower was a witness because he happened to be at\r\nPort-Bredy at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard stood as if idiotized. She was so alarmed at his silence that\r\nshe murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over\r\nthe perilous fortnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard at length. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good\xe2\x80\x94what, married him\r\nwhilst\xe2\x80\x94bound to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was like this,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers\r\nin her voice; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be cruel! I loved him so much, and I thought\r\nyou might tell him of the past\xe2\x80\x94and that grieved me! And then, when I\r\nhad promised you, I learnt of the rumour that you had\xe2\x80\x94sold your first\r\nwife at a fair like a horse or cow! How could I keep my promise after\r\nhearing that? I could not risk myself in your hands; it would have been\r\nletting myself down to take your name after such a scandal. But I knew\r\nI should lose Donald if I did not secure him at once\xe2\x80\x94for you would\r\ncarry out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance, as\r\nlong as there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so. But\r\nyou will not do so now, will you, Michael? for it is too late to\r\nseparate us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notes of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s bells in full peal had been wafted to them\r\nwhile he spoke, and now the genial thumping of the town band, renowned\r\nfor its unstinted use of the drum-stick, throbbed down the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I think he has told them, or else Mr. Grower has.... May I leave\r\nyou now? My\xe2\x80\x94he was detained at Port-Bredy to-day, and sent me on a few\r\nhours before him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is _his wife\xe2\x80\x99s_ life I have saved this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94and he will be for ever grateful to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to him.... O you false woman!\xe2\x80\x9d burst from Henchard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! But it was under compulsion, and I did not know all your\r\npast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind to punish you as you deserve! One word to this\r\nbran-new husband of how you courted me, and your precious happiness is\r\nblown to atoms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael\xe2\x80\x94pity me, and be generous!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve pity! You did; but you don\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you to pay off your debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pensioner of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94not I! Don\xe2\x80\x99t stay with me longer\xe2\x80\x94I shall\r\nsay something worse. Go home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe disappeared under the trees of the south walk as the band came\r\nround the corner, awaking the echoes of every stock and stone in\r\ncelebration of her happiness. Lucetta took no heed, but ran up the back\r\nstreet and reached her own home unperceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his\r\nboxes and other effects from his late lodgings to Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s house. The\r\nwork was not heavy, but it had been much hindered on account of the\r\nfrequent pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event,\r\nof which the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment of leaving Port-Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin,\r\nhad been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional\r\ncircumstances, he was not the man to neglect. Moreover, there was a\r\nconvenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house. Nobody there as yet\r\nknew what had happened; and she was best in a position to break the\r\nnews to the inmates, and give directions for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccommodation. He had, therefore, sent on his two-days\xe2\x80\x99 bride in a\r\nhired brougham, whilst he went across the country to a certain group of\r\nwheat and barley ricks a few miles off, telling her the hour at which\r\nhe might be expected the same evening. This accounted for her trotting\r\nout to meet him after their separation of four hours.\r\n\r\nBy a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in\r\nreadiness to receive Donald at High-Place Hall when he came on from his\r\nlodgings. One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come\r\nwhat would, she had secured him. Half-an-hour after her arrival he\r\nwalked in, and she met him with a relieved gladness, which a month\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperilous absence could not have intensified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing I have not done; and yet it is important,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nearnestly, when she had finished talking about the adventure with the\r\nbull. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, broken the news of our marriage to my dear\r\nElizabeth-Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and you have not?\xe2\x80\x9d he said thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave her a lift from\r\nthe barn homewards; but I did not tell her either; for I thought she\r\nmight have heard of it in the town, and was keeping back her\r\ncongratulations from shyness, and all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can hardly have heard of it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll find out; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to her\r\nnow. And, Donald, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind her living on with me just the same as\r\nbefore? She is so quiet and unassuming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, indeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Farfrae answered with, perhaps, a faint\r\nawkwardness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I wonder if she would care to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure she would like to. Besides,\r\npoor thing, she has no other home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of\r\nher more reserved friend. He liked her all the better for the\r\nblindness. \xe2\x80\x9cArrange as you like with her by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nI who have come to your house, not you to mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run and speak to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta.\r\n\r\nWhen she got upstairs to Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s room the latter had taken off\r\nher out-door things, and was resting over a book. Lucetta found in a\r\nmoment that she had not yet learnt the news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not come down to you, Miss Templeman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\ncoming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright, but I found\r\nyou had a visitor. What are the bells ringing for, I wonder? And the\r\nband, too, is playing. Somebody must be married; or else they are\r\npractising for Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta uttered a vague \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and seating herself by the other young\r\nwoman looked musingly at her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lonely creature you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npresently said; \xe2\x80\x9cnever knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, or what people are\r\ntalking about everywhere with keen interest. You should get out, and\r\ngossip about as other women do, and then you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be obliged to ask\r\nme a question of that kind. Well, now, I have something to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane said she was so glad, and made herself receptive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go rather a long way back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta, the difficulty of\r\nexplaining herself satisfactorily to the pondering one beside her\r\ngrowing more apparent at each syllable. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember that trying case\r\nof conscience I told you of some time ago\xe2\x80\x94about the first lover and the\r\nsecond lover?\xe2\x80\x9d She let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of\r\nthe story she had told.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes\xe2\x80\x94I remember the story of _your friend_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth drily,\r\nregarding the irises of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s eyes as though to catch their exact\r\nshade. \xe2\x80\x9cThe two lovers\xe2\x80\x94the old one and the new: how she wanted to marry\r\nthe second, but felt she ought to marry the first; so that the good she\r\nwould have done she did not, and the evil that she would not, that she\r\ndid\xe2\x80\x94exactly like the Apostle Paul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no; she didn\xe2\x80\x99t do evil exactly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said that she\xe2\x80\x94or as I may say _you_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94answered Elizabeth,\r\ndropping the mask, \xe2\x80\x9cwere in honour and conscience bound to marry the\r\nfirst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s blush at being seen through came and went again before she\r\nreplied anxiously, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will never breathe this, will you,\r\nElizabeth-Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, if you say not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will tell you that the case is more complicated\xe2\x80\x94worse, in\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94than it seemed in my story. I and the first man were thrown\r\ntogether in a strange way, and felt that we ought to be united, as the\r\nworld had talked of us. He was a widower, as he supposed. He had not\r\nheard of his first wife for many years. But the wife returned, and we\r\nparted. She is now dead, and the husband comes paying me addresses\r\nagain, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll complete our purposes.\xe2\x80\x99 But, Elizabeth-Jane,\r\nall this amounts to a new courtship of me by him; I was absolved from\r\nall vows by the return of the other woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not lately renewed your promise?\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger with quiet\r\nsurmise. She had divined Man Number One.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was wrung from me by a threat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was. But I think when any one gets coupled up with a man in\r\nthe past so unfortunately as you have done she ought to become his wife\r\nif she can, even if she were not the sinning party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s countenance lost its sparkle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe turned out to be a man I\r\nshould be afraid to marry,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cReally afraid! And it was not\r\ntill after my renewed promise that I knew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there is only one course left to honesty. You must remain a\r\nsingle woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think again! Do consider\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted her companion hardily. \xe2\x80\x9cI have guessed very\r\nwell who the man is. My father; and I say it is him or nobody for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny suspicion of impropriety was to Elizabeth-Jane like a red rag to a\r\nbull. Her craving for correctness of procedure was, indeed, almost\r\nvicious. Owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a\r\nsemblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names\r\nare safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to marry Mr.\r\nHenchard or nobody\xe2\x80\x94certainly not another man!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on with a\r\nquivering lip in whose movement two passions shared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t admit that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta passionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit it or not, it is true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta covered her eyes with her right hand, as if she could plead no\r\nmore, holding out her left to Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you _have_ married him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, jumping up with\r\npleasure after a glance at Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you do it? Why\r\ndid you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this? How very\r\nhonourable of you! He did treat my mother badly once, it seems, in a\r\nmoment of intoxication. And it is true that he is stern sometimes. But\r\nyou will rule him entirely, I am sure, with your beauty and wealth and\r\naccomplishments. You are the woman he will adore, and we shall all\r\nthree be happy together now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, my Elizabeth-Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucetta distressfully. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis somebody\r\nelse that I have married! I was so desperate\xe2\x80\x94so afraid of being forced\r\nto anything else\xe2\x80\x94so afraid of revelations that would quench his love\r\nfor me, that I resolved to do it offhand, come what might, and purchase\r\na week of happiness at any cost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94have\xe2\x80\x94married Mr. Farfrae!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Elizabeth-Jane, in Nathan tones\r\n\r\nLucetta bowed. She had recovered herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bells are ringing on that account,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband is\r\ndownstairs. He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for\r\nus; and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me think of it alone,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl quickly replied, corking up the\r\nturmoil of her feeling with grand control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall. I am sure we shall be happy together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta departed to join Donald below, a vague uneasiness floating over\r\nher joy at seeing him quite at home there. Not on account of her friend\r\nElizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s alone.\r\n\r\nNow the instant decision of Susan Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was to dwell in\r\nthat house no more. Apart from her estimate of the propriety of\r\nLucetta\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she\r\nfelt she could not abide there.\r\n\r\nIt was still early in the evening when she hastily put on her things\r\nand went out. In a few minutes, knowing the ground, she had found a\r\nsuitable lodging, and arranged to enter it that night. Returning and\r\nentering noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and arrayed herself\r\nin a plain one, packing up the other to keep as her best; for she would\r\nhave to be very economical now. She wrote a note to leave for Lucetta,\r\nwho was closely shut up in the drawing-room with Farfrae; and then\r\nElizabeth-Jane called a man with a wheel-barrow; and seeing her boxes\r\nput into it she trotted off down the street to her rooms. They were in\r\nthe street in which Henchard lived, and almost opposite his door.\r\n\r\nHere she sat down and considered the means of subsistence. The little\r\nannual sum settled on her by her stepfather would keep body and soul\r\ntogether. A wonderful skill in netting of all sorts\xe2\x80\x94acquired in\r\nchildhood by making seines in Newson\xe2\x80\x99s home\xe2\x80\x94might serve her in good\r\nstead; and her studies, which were pursued unremittingly, might serve\r\nher in still better.\r\n\r\nBy this time the marriage that had taken place was known throughout\r\nCasterbridge; had been discussed noisily on kerbstones, confidentially\r\nbehind counters, and jovially at the Three Mariners. Whether Farfrae\r\nwould sell his business and set up for a gentleman on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s money,\r\nor whether he would show independence enough to stick to his trade in\r\nspite of his brilliant alliance, was a great point of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\nThe retort of the furmity-woman before the magistrates had spread; and\r\nin four-and-twenty hours there was not a person in Casterbridge who\r\nremained unacquainted with the story of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s mad freak at\r\nWeydon-Priors Fair, long years before. The amends he had made in after\r\nlife were lost sight of in the dramatic glare of the original act. Had\r\nthe incident been well known of old and always, it might by this time\r\nhave grown to be lightly regarded as the rather tall wild oat, but\r\nwell-nigh the single one, of a young man with whom the steady and\r\nmature (if somewhat headstrong) burgher of to-day had scarcely a point\r\nin common. But the act having lain as dead and buried ever since, the\r\ninterspace of years was unperceived; and the black spot of his youth\r\nwore the aspect of a recent crime.\r\n\r\nSmall as the police-court incident had been in itself, it formed the\r\nedge or turn in the incline of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes. On that day\xe2\x80\x94almost\r\nat that minute\xe2\x80\x94he passed the ridge of prosperity and honour, and began\r\nto descend rapidly on the other side. It was strange how soon he sank\r\nin esteem. Socially he had received a startling fillip downwards; and,\r\nhaving already lost commercial buoyancy from rash transactions, the\r\nvelocity of his descent in both aspects became accelerated every hour.\r\n\r\nHe now gazed more at the pavements and less at the house-fronts when he\r\nwalked about; more at the feet and leggings of men, and less into the\r\npupils of their eyes with the blazing regard which formerly had made\r\nthem blink.\r\n\r\nNew events combined to undo him. It had been a bad year for others\r\nbesides himself, and the heavy failure of a debtor whom he had trusted\r\ngenerously completed the overthrow of his tottering credit. And now, in\r\nhis desperation, he failed to preserve that strict correspondence\r\nbetween bulk and sample which is the soul of commerce in grain. For\r\nthis, one of his men was mainly to blame; that worthy, in his great\r\nunwisdom, having picked over the sample of an enormous quantity of\r\nsecond-rate corn which Henchard had in hand, and removed the pinched,\r\nblasted, and smutted grains in great numbers. The produce if honestly\r\noffered would have created no scandal; but the blunder of\r\nmisrepresentation, coming at such a moment, dragged Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\ninto the ditch.\r\n\r\nThe details of his failure were of the ordinary kind. One day\r\nElizabeth-Jane was passing the King\xe2\x80\x99s Arms, when she saw people\r\nbustling in and out more than usual where there was no market. A\r\nbystander informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance, that it\r\nwas a meeting of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy. She\r\nfelt quite tearful, and when she heard that he was present in the hotel\r\nshe wished to go in and see him, but was advised not to intrude that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one,\r\nand Henchard, looking out of the window, had caught sight of\r\nElizabeth-Jane through the wire blind. His examination had closed, and\r\nthe creditors were leaving. The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into\r\na reverie, till, turning his face from the window, and towering above\r\nall the rest, he called their attention for a moment more. His\r\ncountenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity; the\r\nblack hair and whiskers were the same as ever, but a film of ash was\r\nover the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cover and above the assets that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ntalking about, and that appear on the balance-sheet, there be these. It\r\nall belongs to ye, as much as everything else I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwish to keep it from you, not I.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying this, he took his gold watch\r\nfrom his pocket and laid it on the table; then his purse\xe2\x80\x94the yellow\r\ncanvas moneybag, such as was carried by all farmers and dealers\xe2\x80\x94untying\r\nit, and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch. The\r\nlatter he drew back quickly for an instant, to remove the hair-guard\r\nmade and given him by Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, now you have all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the\r\nworld,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wish for your sakes \xe2\x80\x99twas more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe creditors, farmers almost to a man, looked at the watch, and at the\r\nmoney, and into the street; when Farmer James Everdene of Weatherbury\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want that. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nhonourable in ye; but keep it. What do you say, neighbours\xe2\x80\x94do ye\r\nagree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure: we don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grower, another creditor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him keep it, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured another in the background\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsilent, reserved young man named Boldwood; and the rest responded\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the senior Commissioner, addressing Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cthough the\r\ncase is a desperate one, I am bound to admit that I have never met a\r\ndebtor who behaved more fairly. I\xe2\x80\x99ve proved the balance-sheet to be as\r\nhonestly made out as it could possibly be; we have had no trouble;\r\nthere have been no evasions and no concealments. The rashness of\r\ndealing which led to this unhappy situation is obvious enough; but as\r\nfar as I can see every attempt has been made to avoid wronging\r\nanybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard was more affected by this than he cared to let them perceive,\r\nand he turned aside to the window again. A general murmur of agreement\r\nfollowed the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s words, and the meeting dispersed. When they\r\nwere gone Henchard regarded the watch they had returned to him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t mine by rights,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey take it?\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want what don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to me!\xe2\x80\x9d Moved by a\r\nrecollection he took the watch to the maker\xe2\x80\x99s just opposite, sold it\r\nthere and then for what the tradesman offered, and went with the\r\nproceeds to one among the smaller of his creditors, a cottager of\r\nDurnover in straitened circumstances, to whom he handed the money.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was ticketed that Henchard had owned, and the auctions\r\nwere in progress, there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town,\r\nwhich till then for some time past had done nothing but condemn him.\r\nNow that Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s whole career was pictured distinctly to his\r\nneighbours, and they could see how admirably he had used his one talent\r\nof energy to create a position of affluence out of absolutely\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94which was really all he could show when he came to the town as\r\na journeyman hay-trusser, with his wimble and knife in his basket\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwondered and regretted his fall.\r\n\r\nTry as she might, Elizabeth could never meet with him. She believed in\r\nhim still, though nobody else did; and she wanted to be allowed to\r\nforgive him for his roughness to her, and to help him in his trouble.\r\n\r\nShe wrote to him; he did not reply. She then went to his house\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ngreat house she had lived in so happily for a time\xe2\x80\x94with its front of\r\ndun brick, vitrified here and there and its heavy sash-bars\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nHenchard was to be found there no more. The ex-Mayor had left the home\r\nof his prosperity, and gone into Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s cottage by the Priory Mill\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsad purlieu to which he had wandered on the night of his discovery that\r\nshe was not his daughter. Thither she went.\r\n\r\nElizabeth thought it odd that he had fixed on this spot to retire to,\r\nbut assumed that necessity had no choice. Trees which seemed old enough\r\nto have been planted by the friars still stood around, and the back\r\nhatch of the original mill yet formed a cascade which had raised its\r\nterrific roar for centuries. The cottage itself was built of old stones\r\nfrom the long dismantled Priory, scraps of tracery, moulded\r\nwindow-jambs, and arch-labels, being mixed in with the rubble of the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nIn this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms, Jopp, whom Henchard had\r\nemployed, abused, cajoled, and dismissed by turns, being the\r\nhouseholder. But even here her stepfather could not be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by his daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy nobody\xe2\x80\x94at present: that\xe2\x80\x99s his order,\xe2\x80\x9d she was informed.\r\n\r\nAfterwards she was passing by the corn-stores and hay-barns which had\r\nbeen the headquarters of his business. She knew that he ruled there no\r\nlonger; but it was with amazement that she regarded the familiar\r\ngateway. A smear of decisive lead-coloured paint had been laid on to\r\nobliterate Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s name, though its letters dimly loomed through\r\nlike ships in a fog. Over these, in fresh white, spread the name of\r\nFarfrae.\r\n\r\nAbel Whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket, and she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Farfrae is master here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYaas, Miss Henchet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Farfrae have bought the concern and\r\nall of we work-folk with it; and \xe2\x80\x99tis better for us than \xe2\x80\x99twas\xe2\x80\x94though I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that to you as a daughter-law. We work harder, but we\r\nbain\xe2\x80\x99t made afeard now. It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin! No\r\nbusting out, no slamming of doors, no meddling with yer eternal soul\r\nand all that; and though \xe2\x80\x99tis a shilling a week less I\xe2\x80\x99m the richer\r\nman; for what\xe2\x80\x99s all the world if yer mind is always in a larry, Miss\r\nHenchet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe intelligence was in a general sense true; and Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s stores,\r\nwhich had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of\r\nhis bankruptcy, were stirred into activity again when the new tenant\r\nhad possession. Thenceforward the full sacks, looped with the shining\r\nchain, went scurrying up and down under the cat-head, hairy arms were\r\nthrust out from the different door-ways, and the grain was hauled in;\r\ntrusses of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns, and the\r\nwimbles creaked; while the scales and steel-yards began to be busy\r\nwhere guess-work had formerly been the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\nTwo bridges stood near the lower part of Casterbridge town. The first,\r\nof weather-stained brick, was immediately at the end of High Street,\r\nwhere a diverging branch from that thoroughfare ran round to the\r\nlow-lying Durnover lanes; so that the precincts of the bridge formed\r\nthe merging point of respectability and indigence. The second bridge,\r\nof stone, was further out on the highway\xe2\x80\x94in fact, fairly in the\r\nmeadows, though still within the town boundary.\r\n\r\nThese bridges had speaking countenances. Every projection in each was\r\nworn down to obtuseness, partly by weather, more by friction from\r\ngenerations of loungers, whose toes and heels had from year to year\r\nmade restless movements against these parapets, as they had stood there\r\nmeditating on the aspect of affairs. In the case of the more friable\r\nbricks and stones even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the\r\nsame mixed mechanism. The masonry of the top was clamped with iron at\r\neach joint; since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to\r\nwrench the coping off and throw it down the river, in reckless defiance\r\nof the magistrates.\r\n\r\nFor to this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town;\r\nthose who had failed in business, in love, in sobriety, in crime. Why\r\nthe unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations\r\nin preference to a railing, a gate, or a stile, was not so clear.\r\n\r\nThere was a marked difference of quality between the personages who\r\nhaunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far\r\none of stone. Those of lowest character preferred the former, adjoining\r\nthe town; they did not mind the glare of the public eye. They had been\r\nof comparatively no account during their successes; and though they\r\nmight feel dispirited, they had no particular sense of shame in their\r\nruin. Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets; they wore a\r\nleather strap round their hips or knees, and boots that required a\r\ngreat deal of lacing, but seemed never to get any. Instead of sighing\r\nat their adversities they spat, and instead of saying the iron had\r\nentered into their souls they said they were down on their luck. Jopp\r\nin his time of distress had often stood here; so had Mother Cuxsom,\r\nChristopher Coney, and poor Abel Whittle.\r\n\r\nThe _mis\xc3\xa9rables_ who would pause on the remoter bridge were of a\r\npoliter stamp. They included bankrupts, hypochondriacs, persons who\r\nwere what is called \xe2\x80\x9cout of a situation\xe2\x80\x9d from fault or lucklessness,\r\nthe inefficient of the professional class\xe2\x80\x94shabby-genteel men, who did\r\nnot know how to get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner,\r\nand the yet more weary time between dinner and dark. The eye of this\r\nspecies were mostly directed over the parapet upon the running water\r\nbelow. A man seen there looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty\r\nsure to be one whom the world did not treat kindly for some reason or\r\nother. While one in straits on the townward bridge did not mind who saw\r\nhim so, and kept his back to the parapet to survey the passers-by, one\r\nin straits on this never faced the road, never turned his head at\r\ncoming footsteps, but, sensitive to his own condition, watched the\r\ncurrent whenever a stranger approached, as if some strange fish\r\ninterested him, though every finned thing had been poached out of the\r\nriver years before.\r\n\r\nThere and thus they would muse; if their grief were the grief of\r\noppression they would wish themselves kings; if their grief were\r\npoverty, wish themselves millionaires; if sin, they would wish they\r\nwere saints or angels; if despised love, that they were some\r\nmuch-courted Adonis of county fame. Some had been known to stand and\r\nthink so long with this fixed gaze downward that eventually they had\r\nallowed their poor carcases to follow that gaze; and they were\r\ndiscovered the next morning out of reach of their troubles, either here\r\nor in the deep pool called Blackwater, a little higher up the river.\r\n\r\nTo this bridge came Henchard, as other unfortunates had come before\r\nhim, his way thither being by the riverside path on the chilly edge of\r\nthe town. Here he was standing one windy afternoon when Durnover church\r\nclock struck five. While the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears\r\nacross the damp intervening flat a man passed behind him and greeted\r\nHenchard by name. Henchard turned slightly and saw that the comer was\r\nJopp, his old foreman, now employed elsewhere, to whom, though he hated\r\nhim, he had gone for lodgings because Jopp was the one man in\r\nCasterbridge whose observation and opinion the fallen corn-merchant\r\ndespised to the point of indifference.\r\n\r\nHenchard returned him a scarcely perceptible nod, and Jopp stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and she are gone into their new house to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard absently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich house is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour old one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone into my house?\xe2\x80\x9d And starting up Henchard added, \xe2\x80\x9c_My_ house of\r\nall others in the town!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as somebody was sure to live there, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, it can do\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee no harm that he\xe2\x80\x99s the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite true: he felt that it was doing him no harm. Farfrae, who\r\nhad already taken the yards and stores, had acquired possession of the\r\nhouse for the obvious convenience of its contiguity. And yet this act\r\nof his taking up residence within those roomy chambers while he, their\r\nformer tenant, lived in a cottage, galled Henchard indescribably.\r\n\r\nJopp continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you heard of that fellow who bought all the best\r\nfurniture at your sale? He was bidding for no other than Farfrae all\r\nthe while! It has never been moved out of the house, as he\xe2\x80\x99d already\r\ngot the lease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy furniture too! Surely he\xe2\x80\x99ll buy my body and soul likewise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no saying he won\xe2\x80\x99t, if you be willing to sell.\xe2\x80\x9d And having\r\nplanted these wounds in the heart of his once imperious master Jopp\r\nwent on his way; while Henchard stared and stared into the racing river\r\ntill the bridge seemed moving backward with him.\r\n\r\nThe low land grew blacker, and the sky a deeper grey, When the\r\nlandscape looked like a picture blotted in with ink, another traveller\r\napproached the great stone bridge. He was driving a gig, his direction\r\nbeing also townwards. On the round of the middle of the arch the gig\r\nstopped. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henchard?\xe2\x80\x9d came from it in the voice of Farfrae. Henchard\r\nturned his face.\r\n\r\nFinding that he had guessed rightly Farfrae told the man who\r\naccompanied him to drive home; while he alighted and went up to his\r\nformer friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard that you think of emigrating, Mr. Henchard?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit true? I have a real reason for asking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard withheld his answer for several instants, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes;\r\nit is true. I am going where you were going to a few years ago, when I\r\nprevented you and got you to bide here. \xe2\x80\x99Tis turn and turn about, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit! Do ye mind how we stood like this in the Chalk Walk when I\r\npersuaded \xe2\x80\x99ee to stay? You then stood without a chattel to your name,\r\nand I was the master of the house in Corn Street. But now I stand\r\nwithout a stick or a rag, and the master of that house is you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; that\xe2\x80\x99s so! It\xe2\x80\x99s the way o\xe2\x80\x99 the warrld,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, true!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henchard, throwing himself into a mood of\r\njocularity. \xe2\x80\x9cUp and down! I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it. What\xe2\x80\x99s the odds after all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen to me, if it\xe2\x80\x99s no taking up your time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, \xe2\x80\x9cjust\r\nas I listened to you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go. Stay at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can do nothing else, man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little\r\nmoney I have will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks, and\r\nno more. I have not felt inclined to go back to journey-work yet; but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stay doing nothing, and my best chance is elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but what I propose is this\xe2\x80\x94if ye will listen. Come and live in\r\nyour old house. We can spare some rooms very well\xe2\x80\x94I am sure my wife\r\nwould not mind it at all\xe2\x80\x94until there\xe2\x80\x99s an opening for ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard started. Probably the picture drawn by the unsuspecting Donald\r\nof himself under the same roof with Lucetta was too striking to be\r\nreceived with equanimity. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he said gruffly; \xe2\x80\x9cwe should\r\nquarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should hae a part to yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae; \xe2\x80\x9cand nobody to\r\ninterfere wi\xe2\x80\x99 you. It will be a deal healthier than down there by the\r\nriver where you live now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Henchard refused. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I can do no less than thank \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked into the town together side by side, as they had done when\r\nHenchard persuaded the young Scotchman to remain. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you come in and\r\nhave some supper?\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae when they reached the middle of the\r\ntown, where their paths diverged right and left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye, I had nearly forgot. I bought a good deal of your\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I have heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was no that I wanted it so very much for myself; but I wish\r\nye to pick out all that you care to have\xe2\x80\x94such things as may be endeared\r\nto ye by associations, or particularly suited to your use. And take\r\nthem to your own house\xe2\x80\x94it will not be depriving me, we can do with less\r\nvery well, and I will have plenty of opportunities of getting more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94give it to me for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you paid the\r\ncreditors for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; but maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s worth more to you than it is to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard was a little moved. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94sometimes think I\xe2\x80\x99ve wronged \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid\r\nin his face. He shook Farfrae abruptly by the hand, and hastened away\r\nas if unwilling to betray himself further. Farfrae saw him turn through\r\nthe thoroughfare into Bull Stake and vanish down towards the Priory\r\nMill.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Elizabeth-Jane, in an upper room no larger than the Prophet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber, and with the silk attire of her palmy days packed away in a\r\nbox, was netting with great industry between the hours which she\r\ndevoted to studying such books as she could get hold of.\r\n\r\nHer lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s former residence,\r\nnow Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s, she could see Donald and Lucetta speeding in and out of\r\ntheir door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation. She\r\navoided looking that way as much as possible, but it was hardly in\r\nhuman nature to keep the eyes averted when the door slammed.\r\n\r\nWhile living on thus quietly she heard the news that Henchard had\r\ncaught cold and was confined to his room\xe2\x80\x94possibly a result of standing\r\nabout the meads in damp weather. She went off to his house at once.\r\nThis time she was determined not to be denied admittance, and made her\r\nway upstairs. He was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him,\r\nand at first resented her intrusion. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away\xe2\x80\x94go away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like to see \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ice was broken, and she remained. She made the room more\r\ncomfortable, gave directions to the people below, and by the time she\r\nwent away had reconciled her stepfather to her visiting him.\r\n\r\nThe effect, either of her ministrations or of her mere presence, was a\r\nrapid recovery. He soon was well enough to go out; and now things\r\nseemed to wear a new colour in his eyes. He no longer thought of\r\nemigration, and thought more of Elizabeth. The having nothing to do\r\nmade him more dreary than any other circumstance; and one day, with\r\nbetter views of Farfrae than he had held for some time, and a sense\r\nthat honest work was not a thing to be ashamed of, he stoically went\r\ndown to Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s yard and asked to be taken on as a journeyman\r\nhay-trusser. He was engaged at once. This hiring of Henchard was done\r\nthrough a foreman, Farfrae feeling that it was undesirable to come\r\npersonally in contact with the ex-corn-factor more than was absolutely\r\nnecessary. While anxious to help him he was well aware by this time of\r\nhis uncertain temper, and thought reserved relations best. For the same\r\nreason his orders to Henchard to proceed to this and that country farm\r\ntrussing in the usual way were always given through a third person.\r\n\r\nFor a time these arrangements worked well, it being the custom to truss\r\nin the respective stack-yards, before bringing it away, the hay bought\r\nat the different farms about the neighbourhood; so that Henchard was\r\noften absent at such places the whole week long. When this was all\r\ndone, and Henchard had become in a measure broken in, he came to work\r\ndaily on the home premises like the rest. And thus the once flourishing\r\nmerchant and Mayor and what not stood as a day-labourer in the barns\r\nand granaries he formerly had owned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have worked as a journeyman before now, ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d he would say in\r\nhis defiant way; \xe2\x80\x9cand why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I do it again?\xe2\x80\x9d But he looked a far\r\ndifferent journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days. Then\r\nhe had worn clean, suitable clothes, light and cheerful in hue;\r\nleggings yellow as marigolds, corduroys immaculate as new flax, and a\r\nneckerchief like a flower-garden. Now he wore the remains of an old\r\nblue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once\r\nblack satin stock, soiled and shabby. Clad thus he went to and fro,\r\nstill comparatively an active man\xe2\x80\x94for he was not much over forty\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsaw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the\r\ngreen door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that\r\nMr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was to be proposed for Mayor\r\nin a year or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she was wise, she was wise in her generation!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard to\r\nhimself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s hay-barn.\r\nHe thought it over as he wimbled his bonds, and the piece of news acted\r\nas a reviviscent breath to that old view of his\xe2\x80\x94of Donald Farfrae as\r\nhis triumphant rival who rode rough-shod over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fellow of his age going to be Mayor, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured with a\r\ncorner-drawn smile on his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cBut \xe2\x80\x99tis her money that floats en\r\nupward. Ha-ha\xe2\x80\x94how cust odd it is! Here be I, his former master, working\r\nfor him as man, and he the man standing as master, with my house and my\r\nfurniture and my what-you-may-call wife all his own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repeated these things a hundred times a day. During the whole period\r\nof his acquaintance with Lucetta he had never wished to claim her as\r\nhis own so desperately as he now regretted her loss. It was no\r\nmercenary hankering after her fortune that moved him, though that\r\nfortune had been the means of making her so much the more desired by\r\ngiving her the air of independence and sauciness which attracts men of\r\nhis composition. It had given her servants, house, and fine clothing\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsetting that invested Lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of\r\nhim who had known her in her narrow days.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly lapsed into moodiness, and at every allusion to the\r\npossibility of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s near election to the municipal chair his\r\nformer hatred of the Scotchman returned. Concurrently with this he\r\nunderwent a moral change. It resulted in his significantly saying every\r\nnow and then, in tones of recklessness, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a fortnight more!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\na dozen days!\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth, lessening his figures day by day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy d\xe2\x80\x99ye say only a dozen days?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Solomon Longways as he worked\r\nbeside Henchard in the granary weighing oats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause in twelve days I shall be released from my oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat oath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe oath to drink no spirituous liquid. In twelve days it will be\r\ntwenty-one years since I swore it, and then I mean to enjoy myself,\r\nplease God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane sat at her window one Sunday, and while there she heard\r\nin the street below a conversation which introduced Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\nShe was wondering what was the matter, when a third person who was\r\npassing by asked the question in her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael Henchard have busted out drinking after taking nothing for\r\ntwenty-one years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane jumped up, put on her things, and went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII.\r\n\r\nAt this date there prevailed in Casterbridge a convivial\r\ncustom\xe2\x80\x94scarcely recognized as such, yet none the less established. On\r\nthe afternoon of every Sunday a large contingent of the Casterbridge\r\njourneymen\xe2\x80\x94steady churchgoers and sedate characters\xe2\x80\x94having attended\r\nservice, filed from the church doors across the way to the Three\r\nMariners Inn. The rear was usually brought up by the choir, with their\r\nbass-viols, fiddles, and flutes under their arms.\r\n\r\nThe great point, the point of honour, on these sacred occasions was for\r\neach man to strictly limit himself to half-a-pint of liquor. This\r\nscrupulosity was so well understood by the landlord that the whole\r\ncompany was served in cups of that measure. They were all exactly\r\nalike\xe2\x80\x94straight-sided, with two leafless lime-trees done in eel-brown on\r\nthe sides\xe2\x80\x94one towards the drinker\xe2\x80\x99s lips, the other confronting his\r\ncomrade. To wonder how many of these cups the landlord possessed\r\naltogether was a favourite exercise of children in the marvellous.\r\nForty at least might have been seen at these times in the large room,\r\nforming a ring round the margin of the great sixteen-legged oak table,\r\nlike the monolithic circle of Stonehenge in its pristine days. Outside\r\nand above the forty cups came a circle of forty smoke-jets from forty\r\nclay pipes; outside the pipes the countenances of the forty\r\nchurch-goers, supported at the back by a circle of forty chairs.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was not the conversation of week-days, but a thing\r\naltogether finer in point and higher in tone. They invariably discussed\r\nthe sermon, dissecting it, weighing it, as above or below the\r\naverage\xe2\x80\x94the general tendency being to regard it as a scientific feat or\r\nperformance which had no relation to their own lives, except as between\r\ncritics and the thing criticized. The bass-viol player and the clerk\r\nusually spoke with more authority than the rest on account of their\r\nofficial connection with the preacher.\r\n\r\nNow the Three Mariners was the inn chosen by Henchard as the place for\r\nclosing his long term of dramless years. He had so timed his entry as\r\nto be well established in the large room by the time the forty\r\nchurch-goers entered to their customary cups. The flush upon his face\r\nproclaimed at once that the vow of twenty-one years had lapsed, and the\r\nera of recklessness begun anew. He was seated on a small table, drawn\r\nup to the side of the massive oak board reserved for the churchmen, a\r\nfew of whom nodded to him as they took their places and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow be\r\nye, Mr. Henchard? Quite a stranger here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard did not take the trouble to reply for a few moments, and his\r\neyes rested on his stretched-out legs and boots. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at\r\nlength; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been down in spirit for weeks; some of ye\r\nknow the cause. I am better now, but not quite serene. I want you\r\nfellows of the choir to strike up a tune; and what with that and this\r\nbrew of Stannidge\xe2\x80\x99s, I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my\r\nminor key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first fiddle. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve let back our\r\nstrings, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, but we can soon pull \xe2\x80\x99em up again. Sound A,\r\nneighbours, and give the man a stave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care a curse what the words be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cHymns,\r\nballets, or rantipole rubbish; the Rogue\xe2\x80\x99s March or the cherubim\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwarble\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis all the same to me if \xe2\x80\x99tis good harmony, and well put out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94heh, heh\xe2\x80\x94it may be we can do that, and not a man among us that\r\nhave sat in the gallery less than twenty year,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader of the\r\nband. \xe2\x80\x9cAs \xe2\x80\x99tis Sunday, neighbours, suppose we raise the Fourth Psa\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nto Samuel Wakely\xe2\x80\x99s tune, as improved by me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang Samuel Wakely\xe2\x80\x99s tune, as improved by thee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cChuck\r\nacross one of your psalters\xe2\x80\x94old Wiltshire is the only tune worth\r\nsinging\xe2\x80\x94the psalm-tune that would make my blood ebb and flow like the\r\nsea when I was a steady chap. I\xe2\x80\x99ll find some words to fit en.\xe2\x80\x9d He took\r\none of the psalters and began turning over the leaves.\r\n\r\nChancing to look out of the window at that moment he saw a flock of\r\npeople passing by, and perceived them to be the congregation of the\r\nupper church, now just dismissed, their sermon having been a longer one\r\nthan that the lower parish was favoured with. Among the rest of the\r\nleading inhabitants walked Mr. Councillor Farfrae with Lucetta upon his\r\narm, the observed and imitated of all the smaller tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwomankind. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s mouth changed a little, and he continued to turn\r\nover the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPsalm the Hundred-and-Ninth, to the tune of\r\nWiltshire: verses ten to fifteen. I gi\xe2\x80\x99e ye the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis seed shall orphans be, his wife\r\n    A widow plunged in grief;\r\nHis vagrant children beg their bread\r\n    Where none can give relief.\r\n\r\nHis ill-got riches shall be made\r\n    To usurers a prey;\r\nThe fruit of all his toil shall be\r\n    By strangers borne away.\r\n\r\nNone shall be found that to his wants\r\n    Their mercy will extend,\r\nOr to his helpless orphan seed\r\n    The least assistance lend.\r\n\r\nA swift destruction soon shall seize\r\n    On his unhappy race;\r\nAnd the next age his hated name\r\n    Shall utterly deface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the Psa\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94I know the Psa\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader hastily; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nwould as lief not sing it. \xe2\x80\x99Twasn\xe2\x80\x99t made for singing. We chose it once\r\nwhen the gipsy stole the pa\xe2\x80\x99son\xe2\x80\x99s mare, thinking to please him, but\r\npa\xe2\x80\x99son were quite upset. Whatever Servant David were thinking about\r\nwhen he made a Psalm that nobody can sing without disgracing himself, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t fathom! Now then, the Fourth Psalm, to Samuel Wakely\xe2\x80\x99s tune, as\r\nimproved by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Od seize your sauce\xe2\x80\x94I tell ye to sing the Hundred-and-Ninth to\r\nWiltshire, and sing it you shall!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a single one\r\nof all the droning crew of ye goes out of this room till that Psalm is\r\nsung!\xe2\x80\x9d He slipped off the table, seized the poker, and going to the\r\ndoor placed his back against it. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, go ahead, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto have your cust pates broke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee, don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee take on so!\xe2\x80\x94As \xe2\x80\x99tis the Sabbath-day, and \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nServant David\xe2\x80\x99s words and not ours, perhaps we don\xe2\x80\x99t mind for once,\r\nhey?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the terrified choir, looking round upon the rest. So\r\nthe instruments were tuned and the comminatory verses sung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank ye, thank ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard in a softened voice, his eyes\r\ngrowing downcast, and his manner that of a man much moved by the\r\nstrains. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you blame David,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on in low tones, shaking his\r\nhead without raising his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knew what he was about when he wrote\r\nthat!... If I could afford it, be hanged if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a church\r\nchoir at my own expense to play and sing to me at these low, dark times\r\nof my life. But the bitter thing is, that when I was rich I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need\r\nwhat I could have, and now I be poor I can\xe2\x80\x99t have what I need!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they paused, Lucetta and Farfrae passed again, this time\r\nhomeward, it being their custom to take, like others, a short walk out\r\non the highway and back, between church and tea-time. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the man\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been singing about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\nThe players and singers turned their heads and saw his meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven\r\nforbid!\xe2\x80\x9d said the bass-player.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the man,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Henchard doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen if I\xe2\x80\x99d known,\xe2\x80\x9d said the performer on the clarionet solemnly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat \xe2\x80\x99twas meant for a living man, nothing should have drawn out of my\r\nwynd-pipe the breath for that Psalm, so help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor from mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first singer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, thought I, as it was made\r\nso long ago perhaps there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much in it, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige a neighbour;\r\nfor there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be said against the tune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my boys, you\xe2\x80\x99ve sung it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for him,\r\nit was partly by his songs that he got over me, and heaved me out.... I\r\ncould double him up like that\xe2\x80\x94and yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid the poker\r\nacross his knee, bent it as if it were a twig, flung it down, and came\r\naway from the door.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Elizabeth-Jane, having heard where her\r\nstepfather was, entered the room with a pale and agonized countenance.\r\nThe choir and the rest of the company moved off, in accordance with\r\ntheir half-pint regulation. Elizabeth-Jane went up to Henchard, and\r\nentreated him to accompany her home.\r\n\r\nBy this hour the volcanic fires of his nature had burnt down, and\r\nhaving drunk no great quantity as yet he was inclined to acquiesce. She\r\ntook his arm, and together they went on. Henchard walked blankly, like\r\na blind man, repeating to himself the last words of the singers\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next age his hated name\r\n    Shall utterly deface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a man to my word. I have kept my oath\r\nfor twenty-one years; and now I can drink with a good conscience.... If\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t do for him\xe2\x80\x94well, I am a fearful practical joker when I choose!\r\nHe has taken away everything from me, and by heavens, if I meet him I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t answer for my deeds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese half-uttered words alarmed Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x94all the more by reason of\r\nthe still determination of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s mien.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked cautiously, while trembling with\r\ndisquietude, and guessing Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s allusion only too well.\r\n\r\nHenchard did not answer, and they went on till they had reached his\r\ncottage. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; not to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard; and she went away; feeling that to\r\ncaution Farfrae was almost her duty, as it was certainly her strong\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nAs on the Sunday, so on the week-days, Farfrae and Lucetta might have\r\nbeen seen flitting about the town like two butterflies\xe2\x80\x94or rather like a\r\nbee and a butterfly in league for life. She seemed to take no pleasure\r\nin going anywhere except in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s company; and hence when\r\nbusiness would not permit him to waste an afternoon she remained\r\nindoors waiting for the time to pass till his return, her face being\r\nvisible to Elizabeth-Jane from her window aloft. The latter, however,\r\ndid not say to herself that Farfrae should be thankful for such\r\ndevotion, but, full of her reading, she cited Rosalind\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMistress, know yourself; down on your knees and thank Heaven fasting\r\nfor a good man\xe2\x80\x99s love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her eye upon Henchard also. One day he answered her inquiry\r\nfor his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\nsuch a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he can never get out of his mind the\r\ntime when I was master there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll come and wimble for you instead of him, if you will allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she. Her motive on going to the yard was to get an opportunity of\r\nobserving the general position of affairs on Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s premises now\r\nthat her stepfather was a workman there. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s threats had alarmed\r\nher so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face\r\nto face.\r\n\r\nFor two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any\r\nappearance. Then one afternoon the green door opened, and through came,\r\nfirst Farfrae, and at his heels Lucetta. Donald brought his wife\r\nforward without hesitation, it being obvious that he had no suspicion\r\nwhatever of any antecedents in common between her and the now\r\njourneyman hay-trusser.\r\n\r\nHenchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair, keeping them\r\nfixed on the bond he twisted, as if that alone absorbed him. A feeling\r\nof delicacy, which ever prompted Farfrae to avoid anything that might\r\nseem like triumphing over a fallen rival, led him to keep away from the\r\nhay-barn where Henchard and his daughter were working, and to go on to\r\nthe corn department. Meanwhile Lucetta, never having been informed that\r\nHenchard had entered her husband\xe2\x80\x99s service, rambled straight on to the\r\nbarn, where she came suddenly upon Henchard, and gave vent to a little\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d which the happy and busy Donald was too far off to hear.\r\nHenchard, with withering humility of demeanour, touched the brim of his\r\nhat to her as Whittle and the rest had done, to which she breathed a\r\ndead-alive \xe2\x80\x9cGood afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, as if he had not heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said good afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, good afternoon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, touching his hat again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam glad to see you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d Lucetta looked embarrassed, and Henchard\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cFor we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a\r\nlady should look in and take an interest in us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him entreatingly; the sarcasm was too bitter, too\r\nunendurable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me the time, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hastily; \xe2\x80\x9chalf-past four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank \xe2\x80\x99ee. An hour and a half longer before we are released from work.\r\nAh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that\r\nsuch as you enjoy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could do so Lucetta left him, nodded and smiled to\r\nElizabeth-Jane, and joined her husband at the other end of the\r\nenclosure, where she could be seen leading him away by the outer gates,\r\nso as to avoid passing Henchard again. That she had been taken by\r\nsurprise was obvious. The result of this casual rencounter was that the\r\nnext morning a note was put into Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s hand by the postman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta, with as much bitterness as she could put into\r\na small communication, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you kindly undertake not to speak to me in\r\nthe biting undertones you used to-day, if I walk through the yard at\r\nany time? I bear you no ill-will, and I am only too glad that you\r\nshould have employment of my dear husband; but in common fairness treat\r\nme as his wife, and do not try to make me wretched by covert sneers. I\r\nhave committed no crime, and done you no injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard with fond savagery, holding out the note.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo know no better than commit herself in writing like this! Why, if I\r\nwere to show that to her dear husband\xe2\x80\x94pooh!\xe2\x80\x9d He threw the letter into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nLucetta took care not to come again among the hay and corn. She would\r\nrather have died than run the risk of encountering Henchard at such\r\nclose quarters a second time. The gulf between them was growing wider\r\nevery day. Farfrae was always considerate to his fallen acquaintance;\r\nbut it was impossible that he should not, by degrees, cease to regard\r\nthe ex-corn-merchant as more than one of his other workmen. Henchard\r\nsaw this, and concealed his feelings under a cover of stolidity,\r\nfortifying his heart by drinking more freely at the Three Mariners\r\nevery evening.\r\n\r\nOften did Elizabeth-Jane, in her endeavours to prevent his taking other\r\nliquor, carry tea to him in a little basket at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Arriving\r\none day on this errand she found her stepfather was measuring up\r\nclover-seed and rape-seed in the corn-stores on the top floor, and she\r\nascended to him. Each floor had a door opening into the air under a\r\ncat-head, from which a chain dangled for hoisting the sacks.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s head rose through the trap she perceived that the\r\nupper door was open, and that her stepfather and Farfrae stood just\r\nwithin it in conversation, Farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge, and\r\nHenchard a little way behind. Not to interrupt them she remained on the\r\nsteps without raising her head any higher. While waiting thus she\r\nsaw\xe2\x80\x94or fancied she saw, for she had a terror of feeling certain\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nstepfather slowly raise his hand to a level behind Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders,\r\na curious expression taking possession of his face. The young man was\r\nquite unconscious of the action, which was so indirect that, if Farfrae\r\nhad observed it, he might almost have regarded it as an idle\r\noutstretching of the arm. But it would have been possible, by a\r\ncomparatively light touch, to push Farfrae off his balance, and send\r\nhim head over heels into the air.\r\n\r\nElizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this _might_\r\nhave meant. As soon as they turned she mechanically took the tea to\r\nHenchard, left it, and went away. Reflecting, she endeavoured to assure\r\nherself that the movement was an idle eccentricity, and no more. Yet,\r\non the other hand, his subordinate position in an establishment where\r\nhe once had been master might be acting on him like an irritant poison;\r\nand she finally resolved to caution Donald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.\r\n\r\nNext morning, accordingly, she rose at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock and went into the\r\nstreet. It was not yet light; a dense fog prevailed, and the town was\r\nas silent as it was dark, except that from the rectangular avenues\r\nwhich framed in the borough there came a chorus of tiny rappings,\r\ncaused by the fall of water-drops condensed on the boughs; now it was\r\nwafted from the West Walk, now from the South Walk; and then from both\r\nquarters simultaneously. She moved on to the bottom of Corn Street,\r\nand, knowing his time well, waited only a few minutes before she heard\r\nthe familiar bang of his door, and then his quick walk towards her. She\r\nmet him at the point where the last tree of the engirding avenue\r\nflanked the last house in the street.\r\n\r\nHe could hardly discern her till, glancing inquiringly, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94Miss Henchard\xe2\x80\x94and are ye up so airly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked him to pardon her for waylaying him at such an unseemly time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am anxious to mention something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I wished not to\r\nalarm Mrs. Farfrae by calling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with the cheeriness of a superior. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may it be?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of ye, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe now felt the difficulty of conveying to his mind the exact aspect\r\nof possibilities in her own. But she somehow began, and introduced\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s name. \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes fear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with an effort, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\r\nmay be betrayed into some attempt to\xe2\x80\x94insult you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are the best of friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr to play some practical joke upon you, sir. Remember that he has\r\nbeen hardly used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are quite friendly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr to do something\xe2\x80\x94that would injure you\xe2\x80\x94hurt you\xe2\x80\x94wound you.\xe2\x80\x9d Every\r\nword cost her twice its length of pain. And she could see that Farfrae\r\nwas still incredulous. Henchard, a poor man in his employ, was not to\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s view the Henchard who had ruled him. Yet he was not only the\r\nsame man, but that man with his sinister qualities, formerly latent,\r\nquickened into life by his buffetings.\r\n\r\nFarfrae, happy, and thinking no evil, persisted in making light of her\r\nfears. Thus they parted, and she went homeward, journeymen now being in\r\nthe street, waggoners going to the harness-makers for articles left to\r\nbe repaired, farm-horses going to the shoeing-smiths, and the sons of\r\nlabour showing themselves generally on the move. Elizabeth entered her\r\nlodging unhappily, thinking she had done no good, and only made herself\r\nappear foolish by her weak note of warning.\r\n\r\nBut Donald Farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never\r\nabsolutely lost. He revised impressions from a subsequent point of\r\nview, and the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his\r\npermanent one. The vision of Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s earnest face in the rimy dawn\r\ncame back to him several times during the day. Knowing the solidity of\r\nher character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds.\r\n\r\nBut he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s account that\r\nengaged him just then; and when he met Lawyer Joyce, the town-clerk,\r\nlater in the day, he spoke of it as if nothing had occurred to damp it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout that little seedsman\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe shop overlooking the\r\nchurchyard, which is to let. It is not for myself I want it, but for\r\nour unlucky fellow-townsman Henchard. It would be a new beginning for\r\nhim, if a small one; and I have told the Council that I would head a\r\nprivate subscription among them to set him up in it\xe2\x80\x94that I would be\r\nfifty pounds, if they would make up the other fifty among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; so I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard; and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to say against it for\r\nthat matter,\xe2\x80\x9d the town-clerk replied, in his plain, frank way. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nFarfrae, others see what you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Henchard hates \xe2\x80\x99ee\xe2\x80\x94ay, hates \xe2\x80\x99ee;\r\nand \xe2\x80\x99tis right that you should know it. To my knowledge he was at the\r\nThree Mariners last night, saying in public that about you which a man\r\nought not to say about another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so\xe2\x80\x94ah, is that so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, looking down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he\r\ndo it?\xe2\x80\x9d added the young man bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat harm have I done him that\r\nhe should try to wrong me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod only knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joyce, lifting his eyebrows. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows much\r\nlong-suffering in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me. How can\r\nI forget that when I came here \xe2\x80\x99twas he enabled me to make a footing\r\nfor mysel\xe2\x80\x99? No, no. As long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve a day\xe2\x80\x99s work to offer he shall do\r\nit if he chooses. \xe2\x80\x99Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that.\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think\r\nmore about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme. But a damp having been\r\nthrown over it by these and other voices in the air, he went and\r\ncountermanded his orders. The then occupier of the shop was in it when\r\nFarfrae spoke to him and feeling it necessary to give some explanation\r\nof his withdrawal from the negotiation Donald mentioned Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, and stated that the intentions of the Council had been changed.\r\n\r\nThe occupier was much disappointed, and straight-way informed Henchard,\r\nas soon as he saw him, that a scheme of the Council for setting him up\r\nin a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae. And thus out of\r\nerror enmity grew.\r\n\r\nWhen Farfrae got indoors that evening the tea-kettle was singing on the\r\nhigh hob of the semi-egg-shaped grate. Lucetta, light as a sylph, ran\r\nforward and seized his hands, whereupon Farfrae duly kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried playfully, turning to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cSee\xe2\x80\x94the blinds are\r\nnot drawn down, and the people can look in\xe2\x80\x94what a scandal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the candles were lighted, the curtains drawn, and the twain sat at\r\ntea, she noticed that he looked serious. Without directly inquiring why\r\nshe let her eyes linger solicitously on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has called?\xe2\x80\x9d he absently asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAny folk for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Donald?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94nothing worth talking of,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, never mind it. You will get through it, Scotchmen are always\r\nlucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not always!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head gloomily as he contemplated\r\na crumb on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI know many who have not been so! There was\r\nSandy Macfarlane, who started to America to try his fortune, and he was\r\ndrowned; and Archibald Leith, he was murdered! And poor Willie\r\nDunbleeze and Maitland Macfreeze\xe2\x80\x94they fell into bad courses, and went\r\nthe way of all such!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94you old goosey\xe2\x80\x94I was only speaking in a general sense, of course!\r\nYou are always so literal. Now when we have finished tea, sing me that\r\nfunny song about high-heeled shoon and siller tags, and the\r\none-and-forty wooers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. I couldna sing to-night! It\xe2\x80\x99s Henchard\xe2\x80\x94he hates me; so that I\r\nmay not be his friend if I would. I would understand why there should\r\nbe a wee bit of envy; but I cannet see a reason for the whole intensity\r\nof what he feels. Now, can you, Lucetta? It is more like old-fashioned\r\nrivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta had grown somewhat wan. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give him employment\xe2\x80\x94I cannet refuse it. But neither can I blind\r\nmyself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his, there is no\r\nsafeguard for conduct!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you heard\xe2\x80\x94O Donald, dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta in alarm. The\r\nwords on her lips were \xe2\x80\x9canything about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but she did not utter them.\r\nShe could not, however, suppress her agitation, and her eyes filled\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94it is not so serious as ye fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Farfrae soothingly;\r\nthough he did not know its seriousness so well as she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would do what we have talked of,\xe2\x80\x9d mournfully remarked\r\nLucetta. \xe2\x80\x9cGive up business, and go away from here. We have plenty of\r\nmoney, and why should we stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move, and they talked\r\nthereon till a visitor was announced. Their neighbour Alderman Vatt\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfield\xe2\x80\x99s death? Yes\xe2\x80\x94died\r\nthis afternoon at five,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vatt. Chalkfield was the Councilman\r\nwho had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November.\r\n\r\nFarfrae was sorry at the intelligence, and Mr. Vatt continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwe know he\xe2\x80\x99s been going some days, and as his family is well provided\r\nfor we must take it all as it is. Now I have called to ask \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94quite privately. If I should nominate \xe2\x80\x99ee to succeed him, and\r\nthere should be no particular opposition, will \xe2\x80\x99ee accept the chair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are folk whose turn is before mine; and I\xe2\x80\x99m over young, and\r\nmay be thought pushing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for myself only, several have named it. You\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought of going away,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Lucetta, looking at Farfrae\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d Farfrae murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldna refuse if it is the\r\nwish of a respectable majority in the Council.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, look upon yourself as elected. We have had older men\r\nlong enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Farfrae said musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cSee now how it\xe2\x80\x99s ourselves\r\nthat are ruled by the Powers above us! We plan this, but we do that. If\r\nthey want to make me Mayor I will stay, and Henchard must rave as he\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy. If she had not been\r\nimprudence incarnate she would not have acted as she did when she met\r\nHenchard by accident a day or two later. It was in the bustle of the\r\nmarket, when no one could readily notice their discourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI must again ask you what I asked you months\r\nago\xe2\x80\x94to return me any letters or papers of mine that you may have\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nyou have destroyed them? You must see how desirable it is that the time\r\nat Jersey should be blotted out, for the good of all parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless the woman!\xe2\x80\x94I packed up every scrap of your handwriting to\r\ngive you in the coach\xe2\x80\x94but you never appeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe explained how the death of her aunt had prevented her taking the\r\njourney on that day. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what became of the parcel then?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe could not say\xe2\x80\x94he would consider. When she was gone he recollected\r\nthat he had left a heap of useless papers in his former dining-room\r\nsafe\xe2\x80\x94built up in the wall of his old house\xe2\x80\x94now occupied by Farfrae. The\r\nletters might have been amongst them.\r\n\r\nA grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s face. Had that safe been\r\nopened?\r\n\r\nOn the very evening which followed this there was a great ringing of\r\nbells in Casterbridge, and the combined brass, wood, catgut, and\r\nleather bands played round the town with more prodigality of\r\npercussion-notes than ever. Farfrae was Mayor\xe2\x80\x94the two-hundredth odd of\r\na series forming an elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94and the fair Lucetta was the courted of the town.... But, Ah! the\r\nworm i\xe2\x80\x99 the bud\xe2\x80\x94Henchard; what he could tell!\r\n\r\nHe, in the meantime, festering with indignation at some erroneous\r\nintelligence of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the scheme for installing him\r\nin the little seed-shop, was greeted with the news of the municipal\r\nelection (which, by reason of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s comparative youth and his\r\nScottish nativity\xe2\x80\x94a thing unprecedented in the case\xe2\x80\x94had an interest far\r\nbeyond the ordinary). The bell-ringing and the band-playing, loud as\r\nTamerlane\xe2\x80\x99s trumpet, goaded the downfallen Henchard indescribably: the\r\nousting now seemed to him to be complete.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he went to the corn-yard as usual, and about eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock Donald entered through the green door, with no trace of the\r\nworshipful about him. The yet more emphatic change of places between\r\nhim and Henchard which this election had established renewed a slight\r\nembarrassment in the manner of the modest young man; but Henchard\r\nshowed the front of one who had overlooked all this; and Farfrae met\r\nhis amenities half-way at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cabout a packet that I may\r\npossibly have left in my old safe in the dining-room.\xe2\x80\x9d He added\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf so, it is there now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never opened the safe\r\nat all as yet; for I keep ma papers at the bank, to sleep easy o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not of much consequence\xe2\x80\x94to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll call\r\nfor it this evening, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite late when he fulfilled his promise. He had primed himself\r\nwith grog, as he did very frequently now, and a curl of sardonic humour\r\nhung on his lip as he approached the house, as though he were\r\ncontemplating some terrible form of amusement. Whatever it was, the\r\nincident of his entry did not diminish its force, this being his first\r\nvisit to the house since he had lived there as owner. The ring of the\r\nbell spoke to him like the voice of a familiar drudge who had been\r\nbribed to forsake him; the movements of the doors were revivals of dead\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nFarfrae invited him into the dining-room, where he at once unlocked the\r\niron safe built into the wall, _his_, Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s safe, made by an\r\ningenious locksmith under his direction. Farfrae drew thence the\r\nparcel, and other papers, with apologies for not having returned them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard drily. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is they are letters\r\nmostly.... Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, sitting down and unfolding Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npassionate bundle, \xe2\x80\x9chere they be. That ever I should see \xe2\x80\x99em again! I\r\nhope Mrs. Farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has felt a bit weary; and has gone to bed airly on that account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard returned to the letters, sorting them over with interest,\r\nFarfrae being seated at the other end of the dining-table. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforget, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat curious chapter in the history of\r\nmy past which I told you of, and that you gave me some assistance in?\r\nThese letters are, in fact, related to that unhappy business. Though,\r\nthank God, it is all over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat became of the poor woman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily she married, and married well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that these\r\nreproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges, as\r\nthey might otherwise have done.... Just listen to what an angry woman\r\nwill say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and\r\nbursting with yawns, gave well-mannered attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98For me,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard read, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98there is practically no future. A creature\r\ntoo unconventionally devoted to you\xe2\x80\x94who feels it impossible that she\r\ncan be the wife of any other man; and who is yet no more to you than\r\nthe first woman you meet in the street\xe2\x80\x94such am I. I quite acquit you of\r\nany intention to wrong me, yet you are the door through which wrong has\r\ncome to me. That in the event of your present wife\xe2\x80\x99s death you will\r\nplace me in her position is a consolation so far as it goes\xe2\x80\x94but how far\r\ndoes it go? Thus I sit here, forsaken by my few acquaintance, and\r\nforsaken by you!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how she went on to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cacres of words like\r\nthat, when what had happened was what I could not cure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae absently, \xe2\x80\x9cit is the way wi\xe2\x80\x99 women.\xe2\x80\x9d But the fact\r\nwas that he knew very little of the sex; yet detecting a sort of\r\nresemblance in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped\r\nand those of the supposed stranger, he concluded that Aphrodite ever\r\nspoke thus, whosesoever the personality she assumed.\r\n\r\nHenchard unfolded another letter, and read it through likewise,\r\nstopping at the subscription as before. \xe2\x80\x9cHer name I don\xe2\x80\x99t give,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry her, and another man did, I can\r\nscarcely do that in fairness to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTr-rue, tr-rue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you marry her when your\r\nwife Susan died?\xe2\x80\x9d Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the\r\ncomfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94well you may ask that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, the new-moon-shaped grin\r\nadumbrating itself again upon his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of all her\r\nprotestations, when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound,\r\nshe was not the woman for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had already married another\xe2\x80\x94maybe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to\r\ndescend further into particulars, and he answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very\r\nreadily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had, she had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard emphatically.\r\n\r\nHe opened a third and fourth letter, and read. This time he approached\r\nthe conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest.\r\nBut again he stopped short. The truth was that, as may be divined, he\r\nhad quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this\r\ndrama by reading out the name, he had come to the house with no other\r\nthought. But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it.\r\n\r\nSuch a wrecking of hearts appalled even him. His quality was such that\r\nhe could have annihilated them both in the heat of action; but to\r\naccomplish the deed by oral poison was beyond the nerve of his enmity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV.\r\n\r\nAs Donald stated, Lucetta had retired early to her room because of\r\nfatigue. She had, however, not gone to rest, but sat in the bedside\r\nchair reading and thinking over the events of the day. At the ringing\r\nof the door-bell by Henchard she wondered who it should be that would\r\ncall at that comparatively late hour. The dining-room was almost under\r\nher bed-room; she could hear that somebody was admitted there, and\r\npresently the indistinct murmur of a person reading became audible.\r\n\r\nThe usual time for Donald\xe2\x80\x99s arrival upstairs came and passed, yet still\r\nthe reading and conversation went on. This was very singular. She could\r\nthink of nothing but that some extraordinary crime had been committed,\r\nand that the visitor, whoever he might be, was reading an account of it\r\nfrom a special edition of the _Casterbridge Chronicle_. At last she\r\nleft the room, and descended the stairs. The dining-room door was ajar,\r\nand in the silence of the resting household the voice and the words\r\nwere recognizable before she reached the lower flight. She stood\r\ntransfixed. Her own words greeted her in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s voice, like spirits\r\nfrom the grave.\r\n\r\nLucetta leant upon the banister with her cheek against the smooth\r\nhand-rail, as if she would make a friend of it in her misery. Rigid in\r\nthis position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear. But\r\nwhat amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke merely in\r\nthe accents of a man who made a present of his time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that\r\nHenchard was unfolding yet another sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it quite fair to this\r\nyoung woman\xe2\x80\x99s memory to read at such length to a stranger what was\r\nintended for your eye alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cBy not giving her name I make it an\r\nexample of all womankind, and not a scandal to one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were you I would destroy them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, giving more thought\r\nto the letters than he had hitherto done. \xe2\x80\x9cAs another man\xe2\x80\x99s wife it\r\nwould injure the woman if it were known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shall not destroy them,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Henchard, putting the letters\r\naway. Then he arose, and Lucetta heard no more.\r\n\r\nShe went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state. For very fear\r\nshe could not undress, but sat on the edge of the bed, waiting. Would\r\nHenchard let out the secret in his parting words? Her suspense was\r\nterrible. Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance\r\nhe might possibly have got over it, and married her just the\r\nsame\xe2\x80\x94unlikely as it had once seemed; but for her or any one else to\r\ntell him now would be fatal.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed; she could hear her husband bolting it. After looking\r\nround in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs. The spark\r\nin her eyes well-nigh went out when he appeared round the bedroom door.\r\nHer gaze hung doubtful for a moment, then to her joyous amazement she\r\nsaw that he looked at her with the rallying smile of one who had just\r\nbeen relieved of a scene that was irksome. She could hold out no\r\nlonger, and sobbed hysterically.\r\n\r\nWhen he had restored her Farfrae naturally enough spoke of Henchard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf all men he was the least desirable as a visitor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\r\nis my belief that he\xe2\x80\x99s just a bit crazed. He has been reading to me a\r\nlong lot of letters relating to his past life; and I could do no less\r\nthan indulge him by listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was sufficient. Henchard, then, had not told. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nwords to Farfrae, in short, as he stood on the doorstep, had been\r\nthese: \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to \xe2\x80\x99ee for listening. I may tell more about\r\nher some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding this, she was much perplexed as to Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s motives in\r\nopening the matter at all; for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a\r\npower of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our\r\nfriends; and forget that abortive efforts from want of heart are as\r\npossible to revenge as to generosity.\r\n\r\nNext morning Lucetta remained in bed, meditating how to parry this\r\nincipient attack. The bold stroke of telling Donald the truth, dimly\r\nconceived, was yet too bold; for she dreaded lest in doing so he, like\r\nthe rest of the world, should believe that the episode was rather her\r\nfault than her misfortune. She decided to employ persuasion\xe2\x80\x94not with\r\nDonald but with the enemy himself. It seemed the only practicable\r\nweapon left her as a woman. Having laid her plan she rose, and wrote to\r\nhim who kept her on these tenterhooks:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI overheard your interview with my husband last night, and saw the\r\ndrift of your revenge. The very thought of it crushes me! Have pity on\r\na distressed woman! If you could see me you would relent. You do not\r\nknow how anxiety has told upon me lately. I will be at the Ring at the\r\ntime you leave work\xe2\x80\x94just before the sun goes down. Please come that\r\nway. I cannot rest till I have seen you face to face, and heard from\r\nyour mouth that you will carry this horse-play no further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo herself she said, on closing up her appeal: \xe2\x80\x9cIf ever tears and\r\npleadings have served the weak to fight the strong, let them do so\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this view she made a toilette which differed from all she had ever\r\nattempted before. To heighten her natural attraction had hitherto been\r\nthe unvarying endeavour of her adult life, and one in which she was no\r\nnovice. But now she neglected this, and even proceeded to impair the\r\nnatural presentation. Beyond a natural reason for her slightly drawn\r\nlook, she had not slept all the previous night, and this had produced\r\nupon her pretty though slightly worn features the aspect of a\r\ncountenance ageing prematurely from extreme sorrow. She selected\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nmuch from want of spirit as design\xe2\x80\x94her poorest, plainest and longest\r\ndiscarded attire.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the contingency of being recognized she veiled herself, and\r\nslipped out of the house quickly. The sun was resting on the hill like\r\na drop of blood on an eyelid by the time she had got up the road\r\nopposite the amphitheatre, which she speedily entered. The interior was\r\nshadowy, and emphatic of the absence of every living thing.\r\n\r\nShe was not disappointed in the fearful hope with which she awaited\r\nhim. Henchard came over the top, descended and Lucetta waited\r\nbreathlessly. But having reached the arena she saw a change in his\r\nbearing: he stood still at a little distance from her; she could not\r\nthink why.\r\n\r\nNor could any one else have known. The truth was that in appointing\r\nthis spot, and this hour, for the rendezvous, Lucetta had unwittingly\r\nbacked up her entreaty by the strongest argument she could have used\r\noutside words, with this man of moods, glooms, and superstitions. Her\r\nfigure in the midst of the huge enclosure, the unusual plainness of her\r\ndress, her attitude of hope and appeal, so strongly revived in his soul\r\nthe memory of another ill-used woman who had stood there and thus in\r\nbygone days, and had now passed away into her rest, that he was\r\nunmanned, and his heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one\r\nof a sex so weak. When he approached her, and before she had spoken a\r\nword, her point was half gained.\r\n\r\nHis manner as he had come down had been one of cynical carelessness;\r\nbut he now put away his grim half-smile, and said, in a kindly subdued\r\ntone, \xe2\x80\x9cGoodnight t\xe2\x80\x99ye. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to come if you want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said apprehensively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to see \xe2\x80\x99ee looking so ill,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered with unconcealed\r\ncompunction.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you be sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\r\ndeliberately cause it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard uneasily. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it anything I have done that has\r\npulled you down like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all your doing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no other grief. My happiness\r\nwould be secure enough but for your threats. O Michael! don\xe2\x80\x99t wreck me\r\nlike this! You might think that you have done enough! When I came here\r\nI was a young woman; now I am rapidly becoming an old one. Neither my\r\nhusband nor any other man will regard me with interest long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard was disarmed. His old feeling of supercilious pity for\r\nwomankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here\r\nas the double of the first. Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight\r\nwhich had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still; she\r\nhad come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving\r\nthe risk. Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed,\r\nlost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no\r\nlonger envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but nothing\r\nmore. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you want me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he said gently. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I shall\r\nbe very willing. My reading of those letters was only a sort of\r\npractical joke, and I revealed nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe\r\nof matrimony or worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it. Every scrap shall be yours.... But, between you and me,\r\nLucetta, he is sure to find out something of the matter, sooner or\r\nlater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with eager tremulousness; \xe2\x80\x9cbut not till I have proved\r\nmyself a faithful and deserving wife to him, and then he may forgive me\r\neverything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard silently looked at her: he almost envied Farfrae such love as\r\nthat, even now. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you shall have the\r\nletters without fail. And your secret shall be kept. I swear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good you are!\xe2\x80\x94how shall I get them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reflected, and said he would send them the next morning. \xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndoubt me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI can keep my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI.\r\n\r\nReturning from her appointment Lucetta saw a man waiting by the lamp\r\nnearest to her own door. When she stopped to go in he came and spoke to\r\nher. It was Jopp.\r\n\r\nHe begged her pardon for addressing her. But he had heard that Mr.\r\nFarfrae had been applied to by a neighbouring corn-merchant to\r\nrecommend a working partner; if so he wished to offer himself. He could\r\ngive good security, and had stated as much to Mr. Farfrae in a letter;\r\nbut he would feel much obliged if Lucetta would say a word in his\r\nfavour to her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a thing I know nothing about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can testify to my trustworthiness better than anybody, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Jopp. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in Jersey several years, and knew you there by\r\nsight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I knew nothing of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that a word or two from you would secure for me what I\r\ncovet very much,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted.\r\n\r\nShe steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair, and\r\ncutting him short, because of her anxiety to get indoors before her\r\nhusband should miss her, left him on the pavement.\r\n\r\nHe watched her till she had vanished, and then went home. When he got\r\nthere he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron\r\ndogs, and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle. A\r\nmovement upstairs disturbed him, and Henchard came down from his\r\nbedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would do me a service, Jopp,\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94to-night, I mean, if you can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s for her.\r\nI should take it myself, of course, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be seen there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed a package in brown paper, sealed. Henchard had been as good\r\nas his word. Immediately on coming indoors he had searched over his few\r\nbelongings, and every scrap of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s writing that he possessed was\r\nhere. Jopp indifferently expressed his willingness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how have ye got on to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d his lodger asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAny prospect of\r\nan opening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp, who had not told the other of his\r\napplication to Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere never will be in Casterbridge,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Henchard decisively.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must roam further afield.\xe2\x80\x9d He said goodnight to Jopp, and returned\r\nto his own part of the house.\r\n\r\nJopp sat on till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the\r\ncandle-snuff on the wall, and looking at the original he found that it\r\nhad formed itself into a head like a red-hot cauliflower. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npacket next met his gaze. He knew there had been something of the\r\nnature of wooing between Henchard and the now Mrs. Farfrae; and his\r\nvague ideas on the subject narrowed themselves down to these: Henchard\r\nhad a parcel belonging to Mrs. Farfrae, and he had reasons for not\r\nreturning that parcel to her in person. What could be inside it? So he\r\nwent on and on till, animated by resentment at Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s haughtiness,\r\nas he thought it, and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides\r\nto this transaction with Henchard, he examined the package. The pen and\r\nall its relations being awkward tools in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s hands he had\r\naffixed the seals without an impression, it never occurring to him that\r\nthe efficacy of such a fastening depended on this. Jopp was far less of\r\na tyro; he lifted one of the seals with his penknife, peeped in at the\r\nend thus opened, saw that the bundle consisted of letters; and, having\r\nsatisfied himself thus far, sealed up the end again by simply softening\r\nthe wax with the candle, and went off with the parcel as requested.\r\n\r\nHis path was by the river-side at the foot of the town. Coming into the\r\nlight at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld\r\nlounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe be just going down Mixen Lane way, to look into Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Finger\r\nafore creeping to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cuxsom. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a fiddle and\r\ntambourine going on there. Lord, what\xe2\x80\x99s all the world\xe2\x80\x94do ye come along\r\ntoo, Jopp\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twon\xe2\x80\x99t hinder ye five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJopp had mostly kept himself out of this company, but present\r\ncircumstances made him somewhat more reckless than usual, and without\r\nmany words he decided to go to his destination that way.\r\n\r\nThough the upper part of Durnover was mainly composed of a curious\r\ncongeries of barns and farm-steads, there was a less picturesque side\r\nto the parish. This was Mixen Lane, now in great part pulled down.\r\n\r\nMixen Lane was the Adullam of all the surrounding villages. It was the\r\nhiding-place of those who were in distress, and in debt, and trouble of\r\nevery kind. Farm-labourers and other peasants, who combined a little\r\npoaching with their farming, and a little brawling and bibbing with\r\ntheir poaching, found themselves sooner or later in Mixen Lane. Rural\r\nmechanics too idle to mechanize, rural servants too rebellious to\r\nserve, drifted or were forced into Mixen Lane.\r\n\r\nThe lane and its surrounding thicket of thatched cottages stretched out\r\nlike a spit into the moist and misty lowland. Much that was sad, much\r\nthat was low, some things that were baneful, could be seen in Mixen\r\nLane. Vice ran freely in and out certain of the doors in the\r\nneighbourhood; recklessness dwelt under the roof with the crooked\r\nchimney; shame in some bow-windows; theft (in times of privation) in\r\nthe thatched and mud-walled houses by the sallows. Even slaughter had\r\nnot been altogether unknown here. In a block of cottages up an alley\r\nthere might have been erected an altar to disease in years gone by.\r\nSuch was Mixen Lane in the times when Henchard and Farfrae were Mayors.\r\n\r\nYet this mildewed leaf in the sturdy and flourishing Casterbridge plant\r\nlay close to the open country; not a hundred yards from a row of noble\r\nelms, and commanding a view across the moor of airy uplands and\r\ncorn-fields, and mansions of the great. A brook divided the moor from\r\nthe tenements, and to outward view there was no way across it\xe2\x80\x94no way to\r\nthe houses but round about by the road. But under every householder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstairs there was kept a mysterious plank nine inches wide; which plank\r\nwas a secret bridge.\r\n\r\nIf you, as one of those refugee householders, came in from business\r\nafter dark\xe2\x80\x94and this was the business time here\xe2\x80\x94you stealthily crossed\r\nthe moor, approached the border of the aforesaid brook, and whistled\r\nopposite the house to which you belonged. A shape thereupon made its\r\nappearance on the other side bearing the bridge on end against the sky;\r\nit was lowered; you crossed, and a hand helped you to land yourself,\r\ntogether with the pheasants and hares gathered from neighbouring\r\nmanors. You sold them slily the next morning, and the day after you\r\nstood before the magistrates with the eyes of all your sympathizing\r\nneighbours concentrated on your back. You disappeared for a time; then\r\nyou were again found quietly living in Mixen Lane.\r\n\r\nWalking along the lane at dusk the stranger was struck by two or three\r\npeculiar features therein. One was an intermittent rumbling from the\r\nback premises of the inn half-way up; this meant a skittle alley.\r\nAnother was the extensive prevalence of whistling in the various\r\ndomiciles\xe2\x80\x94a piped note of some kind coming from nearly every open door.\r\nAnother was the frequency of white aprons over dingy gowns among the\r\nwomen around the doorways. A white apron is a suspicious vesture in\r\nsituations where spotlessness is difficult; moreover, the industry and\r\ncleanliness which the white apron expressed were belied by the postures\r\nand gaits of the women who wore it\xe2\x80\x94their knuckles being mostly on their\r\nhips (an attitude which lent them the aspect of two-handled mugs), and\r\ntheir shoulders against door-posts; while there was a curious alacrity\r\nin the turn of each honest woman\xe2\x80\x99s head upon her neck and in the twirl\r\nof her honest eyes, at any noise resembling a masculine footfall along\r\nthe lane.\r\n\r\nYet amid so much that was bad needy respectability also found a home.\r\nUnder some of the roofs abode pure and virtuous souls whose presence\r\nthere was due to the iron hand of necessity, and to that alone.\r\nFamilies from decayed villages\xe2\x80\x94families of that once bulky, but now\r\nnearly extinct, section of village society called \xe2\x80\x9cliviers,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\nlifeholders\xe2\x80\x94copyholders and others, whose roof-trees had fallen for\r\nsome reason or other, compelling them to quit the rural spot that had\r\nbeen their home for generations\xe2\x80\x94came here, unless they chose to lie\r\nunder a hedge by the wayside.\r\n\r\nThe inn called Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Finger was the church of Mixen Lane.\r\n\r\nIt was centrally situate, as such places should be, and bore about the\r\nsame social relation to the Three Mariners as the latter bore to the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s Arms. At first sight the inn was so respectable as to be\r\npuzzling. The front door was kept shut, and the step was so clean that\r\nevidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface. But at the\r\ncorner of the public-house was an alley, a mere slit, dividing it from\r\nthe next building. Half-way up the alley was a narrow door, shiny and\r\npaintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders. This was the\r\nactual entrance to the inn.\r\n\r\nA pedestrian would be seen abstractedly passing along Mixen Lane; and\r\nthen, in a moment, he would vanish, causing the gazer to blink like\r\nAshton at the disappearance of Ravenswood. That abstracted pedestrian\r\nhad edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways;\r\nfrom the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill.\r\n\r\nThe company at the Three Mariners were persons of quality in comparison\r\nwith the company which gathered here; though it must be admitted that\r\nthe lowest fringe of the Mariner\xe2\x80\x99s party touched the crest of Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat points. Waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here. The\r\nlandlady was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to\r\ngaol as an accessory to something or other after the fact. She\r\nunderwent her twelvemonth, and had worn a martyr\xe2\x80\x99s countenance ever\r\nsince, except at times of meeting the constable who apprehended her,\r\nwhen she winked her eye.\r\n\r\nTo this house Jopp and his acquaintances had arrived. The settles on\r\nwhich they sat down were thin and tall, their tops being guyed by\r\npieces of twine to hooks in the ceiling; for when the guests grew\r\nboisterous the settles would rock and overturn without some such\r\nsecurity. The thunder of bowls echoed from the backyard; swingels hung\r\nbehind the blower of the chimney; and ex-poachers and ex-gamekeepers,\r\nwhom squires had persecuted without a cause, sat elbowing each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94men who in past times had met in fights under the moon, till\r\nlapse of sentences on the one part, and loss of favour and expulsion\r\nfrom service on the other, brought them here together to a common\r\nlevel, where they sat calmly discussing old times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost mind how you could jerk a trout ashore with a bramble, and not\r\nruffle the stream, Charl?\xe2\x80\x9d a deposed keeper was saying. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas at that\r\nI caught \xe2\x80\x99ee once, if you can mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can. But the worst larry for me was that pheasant business at\r\nYalbury Wood. Your wife swore false that time, Joe\xe2\x80\x94O, by Gad, she\r\ndid\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jopp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94Joe closed wi\xe2\x80\x99 me, and we rolled down together, close to his\r\ngarden hedge. Hearing the noise, out ran his wife with the oven pyle,\r\nand it being dark under the trees she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see which was uppermost.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where beest thee, Joe, under or top?\xe2\x80\x99 she screeched. \xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x94under, by\r\nGad!\xe2\x80\x99 says he. She then began to rap down upon my skull, back, and ribs\r\nwith the pyle till we\xe2\x80\x99d roll over again. \xe2\x80\x98Where beest now, dear Joe,\r\nunder or top?\xe2\x80\x99 she\xe2\x80\x99d scream again. By George, \xe2\x80\x99twas through her I was\r\ntook! And then when we got up in hall she sware that the cock pheasant\r\nwas one of her rearing, when \xe2\x80\x99twas not your bird at all, Joe; \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nSquire Brown\xe2\x80\x99s bird\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s whose \xe2\x80\x99twas\xe2\x80\x94one that we\xe2\x80\x99d picked off as we\r\npassed his wood, an hour afore. It did hurt my feelings to be so\r\nwronged!... Ah well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have had \xe2\x80\x99ee days afore that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the keeper. \xe2\x80\x9cI was within\r\na few yards of \xe2\x80\x99ee dozens of times, with a sight more of birds than\r\nthat poor one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis not our greatest doings that the world gets wind of,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe furmity-woman, who, lately settled in this purlieu, sat among the\r\nrest. Having travelled a great deal in her time she spoke with\r\ncosmopolitan largeness of idea. It was she who presently asked Jopp\r\nwhat was the parcel he kept so snugly under his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, therein lies a grand secret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the passion of\r\nlove. To think that a woman should love one man so well, and hate\r\nanother so unmercifully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s the object of your meditation, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne that stands high in this town. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to shame her! Upon my\r\nlife, \xe2\x80\x99twould be as good as a play to read her love-letters, the proud\r\npiece of silk and wax-work! For \xe2\x80\x99tis her love-letters that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove letters? then let\xe2\x80\x99s hear \xe2\x80\x99em, good soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mother Cuxsom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, do ye mind, Richard, what fools we used to be when we were\r\nyounger? Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a\r\npenny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\xe2\x80\x99d put inside, do ye\r\nmind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened\r\nthe letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at\r\nrandom, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the\r\nsecret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the\r\nepistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nance Mockridge. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a humbling thing\r\nfor us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And\r\nnow she\xe2\x80\x99s avowed herself to another man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better for her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the aged furmity-woman. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I saved\r\nher from a real bad marriage, and she\xe2\x80\x99s never been the one to thank\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis as good a ground for a\r\nskimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last\r\none seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the\r\nman who had been called Charl, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let\r\ndown the bridge for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a\r\nlantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path,\r\nwhich ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned.\r\nBeyond the stream was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote\r\nupon their faces as they advanced. Taking up the board that had lain in\r\nreadiness one of them lowered it across the water, and the instant its\r\nfurther end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and there\r\nappeared from the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees, a\r\ndouble-barrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him.\r\nThey asked him if he had had much luck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cAll safe inside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReceiving a reply in the affirmative he went on inwards, the others\r\nwithdrawing the bridge and beginning to retreat in his rear. Before,\r\nhowever, they had entered the house a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cAhoy\xe2\x80\x9d from the moor led\r\nthem to pause.\r\n\r\nThe cry was repeated. They pushed the lantern into an outhouse, and\r\nwent back to the brink of the stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhoy\xe2\x80\x94is this the way to Casterbridge?\xe2\x80\x9d said some one from the other\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in particular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charl. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a river afore \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s for through it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man in the moor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad travelling enough for to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a minute, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charl, finding that the man was no enemy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe, bring the plank and lantern; here\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that\xe2\x80\x99s lost his way.\r\nYou should have kept along the turnpike road, friend, and not have\r\nstrook across here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should\xe2\x80\x94as I see now. But I saw a light here, and says I to myself,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s an outlying house, depend on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe plank was now lowered; and the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s form shaped itself from\r\nthe darkness. He was a middle-aged man, with hair and whiskers\r\nprematurely grey, and a broad and genial face. He had crossed on the\r\nplank without hesitation, and seemed to see nothing odd in the transit.\r\nHe thanked them, and walked between them up the garden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat place is\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when they reached the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA public-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, perhaps it will suit me to put up at. Now then, come in and wet\r\nyour whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey followed him into the inn, where the increased light exhibited him\r\nas one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by\r\nthe ear. He was dressed with a certain clumsy richness\xe2\x80\x94his coat being\r\nfurred, and his head covered by a cap of seal-skin, which, though the\r\nnights were chilly, must have been warm for the daytime, spring being\r\nsomewhat advanced. In his hand he carried a small mahogany case,\r\nstrapped, and clamped with brass.\r\n\r\nApparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him\r\nthrough the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up\r\nat the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses\r\nof the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to\r\nproceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the\r\nlandlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was\r\ncontinued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they mean by a \xe2\x80\x98skimmity-ride\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlady, swinging her long earrings with\r\ndeprecating modesty; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis a\xe2\x80\x99 old foolish thing they do in these parts\r\nwhen a man\xe2\x80\x99s wife is\xe2\x80\x94well, not too particularly his own. But as a\r\nrespectable householder I don\xe2\x80\x99t encourage it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, are they going to do it shortly? It is a good sight to see, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she simpered. And then, bursting into naturalness, and\r\nglancing from the corner of her eye, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis the funniest thing under the\r\nsun! And it costs money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I remember hearing of some such thing. Now I shall be in\r\nCasterbridge for two or three weeks to come, and should not mind seeing\r\nthe performance. Wait a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned back, entered the\r\nsitting-room, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, good folks; I should like to see the old\r\ncustom you are talking of, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being something towards\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94take that.\xe2\x80\x9d He threw a sovereign on the table and returned to the\r\nlandlady at the door, of whom, having inquired the way into the town,\r\nhe took his leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were more where that one came from,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charl when the\r\nsovereign had been taken up and handed to the landlady for safe\r\nkeeping. \xe2\x80\x9cBy George! we ought to have got a few more while we had him\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a respectable house, thank\r\nGod! And I\xe2\x80\x99ll have nothing done but what\xe2\x80\x99s honourable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp; \xe2\x80\x9cnow we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider the business begun, and will\r\nsoon get it in train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nance. \xe2\x80\x9cA good laugh warms my heart more than a\r\ncordial, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJopp gathered up the letters, and it being now somewhat late he did not\r\nattempt to call at Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s with them that night. He reached home,\r\nsealed them up as before, and delivered the parcel at its address next\r\nmorning. Within an hour its contents were reduced to ashes by Lucetta,\r\nwho, poor soul! was inclined to fall down on her knees in thankfulness\r\nthat at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with Henchard\r\nin her past. For though hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence\r\nthan of intention, that episode, if known, was not the less likely to\r\noperate fatally between herself and her husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when the current affairs of Casterbridge\r\nwere interrupted by an event of such magnitude that its influence\r\nreached to the lowest social stratum there, stirring the depths of its\r\nsociety simultaneously with the preparations for the skimmington. It\r\nwas one of those excitements which, when they move a country town,\r\nleave permanent mark upon its chronicles, as a warm summer permanently\r\nmarks the ring in the tree-trunk corresponding to its date.\r\n\r\nA Royal Personage was about to pass through the borough on his course\r\nfurther west, to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way.\r\nHe had consented to halt half-an-hour or so in the town, and to receive\r\nan address from the corporation of Casterbridge, which, as a\r\nrepresentative centre of husbandry, wished thus to express its sense of\r\nthe great services he had rendered to agricultural science and\r\neconomics, by his zealous promotion of designs for placing the art of\r\nfarming on a more scientific footing.\r\n\r\nRoyalty had not been seen in Casterbridge since the days of the third\r\nKing George, and then only by candlelight for a few minutes, when that\r\nmonarch, on a night-journey, had stopped to change horses at the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArms. The inhabitants therefore decided to make a thorough _f\xc3\xaate\r\ncarillon\xc3\xa9e_ of the unwonted occasion. Half-an-hour\xe2\x80\x99s pause was not\r\nlong, it is true; but much might be done in it by a judicious grouping\r\nof incidents, above all, if the weather were fine.\r\n\r\nThe address was prepared on parchment by an artist who was handy at\r\nornamental lettering, and was laid on with the best gold-leaf and\r\ncolours that the sign-painter had in his shop. The Council had met on\r\nthe Tuesday before the appointed day, to arrange the details of the\r\nprocedure. While they were sitting, the door of the Council Chamber\r\nstanding open, they heard a heavy footstep coming up the stairs. It\r\nadvanced along the passage, and Henchard entered the room, in clothes\r\nof frayed and threadbare shabbiness, the very clothes which he had used\r\nto wear in the primal days when he had sat among them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, advancing to the table and laying his hand\r\nupon the green cloth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should like to join ye in this reception\r\nof our illustrious visitor. I suppose I could walk with the rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmbarrassed glances were exchanged by the Council and Grower nearly ate\r\nthe end of his quill-pen off, so gnawed he it during the silence.\r\nFarfrae the young Mayor, who by virtue of his office sat in the large\r\nchair, intuitively caught the sense of the meeting, and as spokesman\r\nwas obliged to utter it, glad as he would have been that the duty\r\nshould have fallen to another tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly see that it would be proper, Mr. Henchard,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nCouncil are the Council, and as ye are no longer one of the body, there\r\nwould be an irregularity in the proceeding. If ye were included, why\r\nnot others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a particular reason for wishing to assist at the ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae looked round. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have expressed the feeling of the\r\nCouncil,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d from Dr. Bath, Lawyer Long, Alderman Tubber, and several\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it\r\nofficially?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid so; it is out of the question, indeed. But of course you\r\ncan see the doings full well, such as they are to be, like the rest of\r\nthe spectators.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard did not reply to that very obvious suggestion, and, turning on\r\nhis heel, went away.\r\n\r\nIt had been only a passing fancy of his, but opposition crystallized it\r\ninto a determination. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome his Royal Highness, or nobody\r\nshall!\xe2\x80\x9d he went about saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to be sat upon by\r\nFarfrae, or any of the rest of the paltry crew! You shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eventful morning was bright, a full-faced sun confronting early\r\nwindow-gazers eastward, and all perceived (for they were practised in\r\nweather-lore) that there was permanence in the glow. Visitors soon\r\nbegan to flock in from county houses, villages, remote copses, and\r\nlonely uplands, the latter in oiled boots and tilt bonnets, to see the\r\nreception, or if not to see it, at any rate to be near it. There was\r\nhardly a workman in the town who did not put a clean shirt on. Solomon\r\nLongways, Christopher Coney, Buzzford, and the rest of that fraternity,\r\nshowed their sense of the occasion by advancing their customary eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock pint to half-past ten; from which they found a difficulty in\r\ngetting back to the proper hour for several days.\r\n\r\nHenchard had determined to do no work that day. He primed himself in\r\nthe morning with a glass of rum, and walking down the street met\r\nElizabeth-Jane, whom he had not seen for a week. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to her, \xe2\x80\x9cmy twenty-one years had expired before this came on, or I\r\nshould never have had the nerve to carry it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry out what?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis welcome I am going to give our Royal visitor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was perplexed. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we go and see it together?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee it! I have other fish to fry. You see it. It will be worth\r\nseeing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could do nothing to elucidate this, and decked herself out with a\r\nheavy heart. As the appointed time drew near she got sight again of her\r\nstepfather. She thought he was going to the Three Mariners; but no, he\r\nelbowed his way through the gay throng to the shop of Woolfrey, the\r\ndraper. She waited in the crowd without.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he emerged, wearing, to her surprise, a brilliant\r\nrosette, while more surprising still, in his hand he carried a flag of\r\nsomewhat homely construction, formed by tacking one of the small Union\r\nJacks, which abounded in the town to-day, to the end of a deal\r\nwand\xe2\x80\x94probably the roller from a piece of calico. Henchard rolled up his\r\nflag on the doorstep, put it under his arm, and went down the street.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the taller members of the crowd turned their heads, and the\r\nshorter stood on tiptoe. It was said that the Royal _cort\xc3\xa8ge_\r\napproached. The railway had stretched out an arm towards Casterbridge\r\nat this time, but had not reached it by several miles as yet; so that\r\nthe intervening distance, as well as the remainder of the journey, was\r\nto be traversed by road in the old fashion. People thus waited\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncounty families in their carriages, the masses on foot\xe2\x80\x94and watched the\r\nfar-stretching London highway to the ringing of bells and chatter of\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nFrom the background Elizabeth-Jane watched the scene. Some seats had\r\nbeen arranged from which ladies could witness the spectacle, and the\r\nfront seat was occupied by Lucetta, the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, just at present.\r\nIn the road under her eyes stood Henchard. She appeared so bright and\r\npretty that, as it seemed, he was experiencing the momentary weakness\r\nof wishing for her notice. But he was far from attractive to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye, ruled as that is so largely by the superficies of things. He was\r\nnot only a journeyman, unable to appear as he formerly had appeared,\r\nbut he disdained to appear as well as he might. Everybody else, from\r\nthe Mayor to the washerwoman, shone in new vesture according to means;\r\nbut Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weather-beaten\r\ngarments of bygone years.\r\n\r\nHence, alas, this occurred: Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s eyes slid over him to this side\r\nand to that without anchoring on his features\xe2\x80\x94as gaily dressed women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes will too often do on such occasions. Her manner signified quite\r\nplainly that she meant to know him in public no more.\r\n\r\nBut she was never tired of watching Donald, as he stood in animated\r\nconverse with his friends a few yards off, wearing round his young neck\r\nthe official gold chain with great square links, like that round the\r\nRoyal unicorn. Every trifling emotion that her husband showed as he\r\ntalked had its reflex on her face and lips, which moved in little\r\nduplicates to his. She was living his part rather than her own, and\r\ncared for no one\xe2\x80\x99s situation but Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s that day.\r\n\r\nAt length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road,\r\nnamely, on the second bridge of which mention has been made, gave a\r\nsignal, and the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of\r\nthe Town Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town. The\r\ncarriages containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the\r\nspot in a cloud of dust, a procession was formed, and the whole came on\r\nto the Town Hall at a walking pace.\r\n\r\nThis spot was the centre of interest. There were a few clear yards in\r\nfront of the Royal carriage, sanded; and into this space a man stepped\r\nbefore any one could prevent him. It was Henchard. He had unrolled his\r\nprivate flag, and removing his hat he staggered to the side of the\r\nslowing vehicle, waving the Union Jack to and fro with his left hand\r\nwhile he blandly held out his right to the Illustrious Personage.\r\n\r\nAll the ladies said with bated breath, \xe2\x80\x9cO, look there!\xe2\x80\x9d and Lucetta was\r\nready to faint. Elizabeth-Jane peeped through the shoulders of those in\r\nfront, saw what it was, and was terrified; and then her interest in the\r\nspectacle as a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear.\r\n\r\nFarfrae, with Mayoral authority, immediately rose to the occasion. He\r\nseized Henchard by the shoulder, dragged him back, and told him roughly\r\nto be off. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met his, and Farfrae observed the fierce\r\nlight in them despite his excitement and irritation. For a moment\r\nHenchard stood his ground rigidly; then by an unaccountable impulse\r\ngave way and retired. Farfrae glanced to the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 gallery, and saw\r\nthat his Calphurnia\xe2\x80\x99s cheek was pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94it is your husband\xe2\x80\x99s old patron!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Blowbody, a lady of\r\nthe neighbourhood who sat beside Lucetta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatron!\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald\xe2\x80\x99s wife with quick indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you say the man is an acquaintance of Mr. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs.\r\nBath, the physician\xe2\x80\x99s wife, a new-comer to the town through her recent\r\nmarriage with the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe works for my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucetta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94is that all? They have been saying to me that it was through him\r\nyour husband first got a footing in Casterbridge. What stories people\r\nwill tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will indeed. It was not so at all. Donald\xe2\x80\x99s genius would have\r\nenabled him to get a footing anywhere, without anybody\xe2\x80\x99s help! He would\r\nhave been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was partly Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance of the circumstances of Donald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival which led her to speak thus, partly the sensation that\r\neverybody seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time. The\r\nincident had occupied but a few moments, but it was necessarily\r\nwitnessed by the Royal Personage, who, however, with practised tact\r\naffected not to have noticed anything unusual. He alighted, the Mayor\r\nadvanced, the address was read; the Illustrious Personage replied, then\r\nsaid a few words to Farfrae, and shook hands with Lucetta as the\r\nMayor\xe2\x80\x99s wife. The ceremony occupied but a few minutes, and the\r\ncarriages rattled heavily as Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s chariots down Corn Street and\r\nout upon the Budmouth Road, in continuation of the journey coastward.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd stood Coney, Buzzford, and Longways. \xe2\x80\x9cSome difference\r\nbetween him now and when he zung at the Dree Mariners,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis wonderful how he could get a lady of her quality to go snacks wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nen in such quick time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. Yet how folk do worship fine clothes! Now there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbetter-looking woman than she that nobody notices at all, because she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nakin to that hontish fellow Henchard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Nance Mockridge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles. I am\r\nquite unequal to the part of villain myself, or I\xe2\x80\x99d gi\xe2\x80\x99e all my small\r\nsilver to see that lady toppered.... And perhaps I shall soon,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nadded significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not a noble passiont for a \xe2\x80\x99oman to keep up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Longways.\r\n\r\nNance did not reply, but every one knew what she meant. The ideas\r\ndiffused by the reading of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s letters at Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Finger had\r\ncondensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog\r\nthrough Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge.\r\n\r\nThe mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart\r\ninto two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived,\r\nwhile Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what\xe2\x80\x99s brewing down there, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Buzzford\r\nmysteriously to the others.\r\n\r\nConey looked at him. \xe2\x80\x9cNot the skimmity-ride?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuzzford nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Longways. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\r\nare getting it up they are keeping it mighty close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were sure o\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99d lay information,\xe2\x80\x9d said Longways emphatically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis too rough a joke, and apt to wake riots in towns. We know that\r\nthe Scotchman is a right enough man, and that his lady has been a right\r\nenough \xe2\x80\x99oman since she came here, and if there was anything wrong about\r\nher afore, that\xe2\x80\x99s their business, not ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConey reflected. Farfrae was still liked in the community; but it must\r\nbe owned that, as the Mayor and man of money, engrossed with affairs\r\nand ambitions, he had lost in the eyes of the poorer inhabitants\r\nsomething of that wondrous charm which he had had for them as a\r\nlight-hearted penniless young man, who sang ditties as readily as the\r\nbirds in the trees. Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed\r\nnot quite the ardour that would have animated it in former days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we make inquiration into it, Christopher,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Longways;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand if we find there\xe2\x80\x99s really anything in it, drop a letter to them\r\nmost concerned, and advise \xe2\x80\x99em to keep out of the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis course was decided on, and the group separated, Buzzford saying to\r\nConey, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, my ancient friend; let\xe2\x80\x99s move on. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more to\r\nsee here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese well-intentioned ones would have been surprised had they known\r\nhow ripe the great jocular plot really was. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d Jopp had\r\nsaid to the Peter\xe2\x80\x99s party at the corner of Mixen Lane. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a wind-up to\r\nthe Royal visit the hit will be all the more pat by reason of their\r\ngreat elevation to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo him, at least, it was not a joke, but a retaliation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings had been brief\xe2\x80\x94too brief\xe2\x80\x94to Lucetta whom an\r\nintoxicating _Weltlust_ had fairly mastered; but they had brought her a\r\ngreat triumph nevertheless. The shake of the Royal hand still lingered\r\nin her fingers; and the chit-chat she had overheard, that her husband\r\nmight possibly receive the honour of knighthood, though idle to a\r\ndegree, seemed not the wildest vision; stranger things had occurred to\r\nmen so good and captivating as her Scotchman was.\r\n\r\nAfter the collision with the Mayor, Henchard had withdrawn behind the\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 stand; and there he stood, regarding with a stare of\r\nabstraction the spot on the lapel of his coat where Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s hand had\r\nseized it. He put his own hand there, as if he could hardly realize\r\nsuch an outrage from one whom it had once been his wont to treat with\r\nardent generosity. While pausing in this half-stupefied state the\r\nconversation of Lucetta with the other ladies reached his ears; and he\r\ndistinctly heard her deny him\xe2\x80\x94deny that he had assisted Donald, that he\r\nwas anything more than a common journeyman.\r\n\r\nHe moved on homeward, and met Jopp in the archway to the Bull Stake.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a snub,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jopp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if I have?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Henchard sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had one too, so we are both under the same cold shade.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nbriefly related his attempt to win Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s intercession.\r\n\r\nHenchard merely heard his story, without taking it deeply in. His own\r\nrelation to Farfrae and Lucetta overshadowed all kindred ones. He went\r\non saying brokenly to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cShe has supplicated to me in her time;\r\nand now her tongue won\xe2\x80\x99t own me nor her eyes see me!... And he\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nangry he looked. He drove me back as if I were a bull breaking\r\nfence.... I took it like a lamb, for I saw it could not be settled\r\nthere. He can rub brine on a green wound!... But he shall pay for it,\r\nand she shall be sorry. It must come to a tussle\xe2\x80\x94face to face; and then\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see how a coxcomb can front a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout further reflection the fallen merchant, bent on some wild\r\npurpose, ate a hasty dinner and went forth to find Farfrae. After being\r\ninjured by him as a rival, and snubbed by him as a journeyman, the\r\ncrowning degradation had been reserved for this day\xe2\x80\x94that he should be\r\nshaken at the collar by him as a vagabond in the face of the whole\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe crowds had dispersed. But for the green arches which still stood as\r\nthey were erected Casterbridge life had resumed its ordinary shape.\r\nHenchard went down Corn Street till he came to Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s house, where\r\nhe knocked, and left a message that he would be glad to see his\r\nemployer at the granaries as soon as he conveniently could come there.\r\nHaving done this he proceeded round to the back and entered the yard.\r\n\r\nNobody was present, for, as he had been aware, the labourers and\r\ncarters were enjoying a half-holiday on account of the events of the\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94though the carters would have to return for a short time later\r\non, to feed and litter down the horses. He had reached the granary\r\nsteps and was about to ascend, when he said to himself aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nstronger than he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard returned to a shed, where he selected a short piece of rope\r\nfrom several pieces that were lying about; hitching one end of this to\r\na nail, he took the other in his right hand and turned himself bodily\r\nround, while keeping his arm against his side; by this contrivance he\r\npinioned the arm effectively. He now went up the ladders to the top\r\nfloor of the corn-stores.\r\n\r\nIt was empty except of a few sacks, and at the further end was the door\r\noften mentioned, opening under the cathead and chain that hoisted the\r\nsacks. He fixed the door open and looked over the sill. There was a\r\ndepth of thirty or forty feet to the ground; here was the spot on which\r\nhe had been standing with Farfrae when Elizabeth-Jane had seen him lift\r\nhis arm, with many misgivings as to what the movement portended.\r\n\r\nHe retired a few steps into the loft and waited. From this elevated\r\nperch his eyes could sweep the roofs round about, the upper parts of\r\nthe luxurious chestnut trees, now delicate in leaves of a week\xe2\x80\x99s age,\r\nand the drooping boughs of the lines; Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s garden and the green\r\ndoor leading therefrom. In course of time\xe2\x80\x94he could not say how\r\nlong\xe2\x80\x94that green door opened and Farfrae came through. He was dressed as\r\nif for a journey. The low light of the nearing evening caught his head\r\nand face when he emerged from the shadow of the wall, warming them to a\r\ncomplexion of flame-colour. Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly\r\nset, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being\r\nunduly marked.\r\n\r\nFarfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a\r\nway which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of\r\nthe song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three\r\nMariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and\r\nscarcely knowing witherward:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s a hand, my trusty fiere,\r\n    And gie\xe2\x80\x99s a hand o\xe2\x80\x99 thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo it!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill ye come up here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see ye. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrang?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard\r\nhim land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the\r\nascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, coming forward.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke in\r\na tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered\r\nthe untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard\r\nhad been drinking.\r\n\r\nHenchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and\r\nstamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to\r\nthe wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s arms was bound to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe stand face to face\xe2\x80\x94man and man. Your\r\nmoney and your fine wife no longer lift \xe2\x80\x99ee above me as they did but\r\nnow, and my poverty does not press me down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Farfrae simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, my lad. You should ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought twice before you affronted\r\nto extremes a man who had nothing to lose. I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood your rivalry,\r\nwhich ruined me, and your snubbing, which humbled me; but your\r\nhustling, that disgraced me, I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae warmed a little at this. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99d no business there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as any one among ye! What, you forward stripling, tell a man\r\nof my age he\xe2\x80\x99d no business there!\xe2\x80\x9d The anger-vein swelled in his\r\nforehead as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou insulted Royalty, Henchard; and \xe2\x80\x99twas my duty, as the chief\r\nmagistrate, to stop you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoyalty be damned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cI am as loyal as you, come to\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not here to argue. Wait till you cool doon, wait till you cool;\r\nand you will see things the same way as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be the one to cool first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard grimly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow this is\r\nthe case. Here be we, in this four-square loft, to finish out that\r\nlittle wrestle you began this morning. There\xe2\x80\x99s the door, forty foot\r\nabove ground. One of us two puts the other out by that door\xe2\x80\x94the master\r\nstays inside. If he likes he may go down afterwards and give the alarm\r\nthat the other has fallen out by accident\xe2\x80\x94or he may tell the\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s his business. As the strongest man I\xe2\x80\x99ve tied one arm to\r\ntake no advantage of \xe2\x80\x99ee. D\xe2\x80\x99ye understand? Then here\xe2\x80\x99s at \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no time for Farfrae to do aught but one thing, to close with\r\nHenchard, for the latter had come on at once. It was a wrestling match,\r\nthe object of each being to give his antagonist a back fall; and on\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s part, unquestionably, that it should be through the door.\r\n\r\nAt the outset Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s hold by his only free hand, the right, was on\r\nthe left side of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s collar, which he firmly grappled, the latter\r\nholding Henchard by his collar with the contrary hand. With his right\r\nhe endeavoured to get hold of his antagonist\xe2\x80\x99s left arm, which,\r\nhowever, he could not do, so adroitly did Henchard keep it in the rear\r\nas he gazed upon the lowered eyes of his fair and slim antagonist.\r\n\r\nHenchard planted the first toe forward, Farfrae crossing him with his;\r\nand thus far the struggle had very much the appearance of the ordinary\r\nwrestling of those parts. Several minutes were passed by them in this\r\nattitude, the pair rocking and writhing like trees in a gale, both\r\npreserving an absolute silence. By this time their breathing could be\r\nheard. Then Farfrae tried to get hold of the other side of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncollar, which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in\r\na wrenching movement, and this part of the struggle ended by his\r\nforcing Farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his\r\nmuscular arms. Hampered as he was, however, he could not keep him\r\nthere, and Farfrae finding his feet again the struggle proceeded as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBy a whirl Henchard brought Donald dangerously near the precipice;\r\nseeing his position the Scotchman for the first time locked himself to\r\nhis adversary, and all the efforts of that infuriated Prince of\r\nDarkness\xe2\x80\x94as he might have been called from his appearance just now\xe2\x80\x94were\r\ninadequate to lift or loosen Farfrae for a time. By an extraordinary\r\neffort he succeeded at last, though not until they had got far back\r\nagain from the fatal door. In doing so Henchard contrived to turn\r\nFarfrae a complete somersault. Had Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s other arm been free it\r\nwould have been all over with Farfrae then. But again he regained his\r\nfeet, wrenching Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s arm considerably, and causing him sharp\r\npain, as could be seen from the twitching of his face. He instantly\r\ndelivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore-hip, as\r\nit used to be expressed, and following up his advantage thrust him\r\ntowards the door, never loosening his hold till Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s fair head was\r\nhanging over the window-sill, and his arm dangling down outside the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard between his gasps, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the end of what you\r\nbegan this morning. Your life is in my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take it, take it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ve wished to long enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard looked down upon him in silence, and their eyes met. \xe2\x80\x9cO\r\nFarfrae!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s not true!\xe2\x80\x9d he said bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cGod is my witness that no\r\nman ever loved another as I did thee at one time.... And now\xe2\x80\x94though I\r\ncame here to kill \xe2\x80\x99ee, I cannot hurt thee! Go and give me in charge\xe2\x80\x94do\r\nwhat you will\xe2\x80\x94I care nothing for what comes of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe withdrew to the back part of the loft, loosened his arm, and flung\r\nhimself in a corner upon some sacks, in the abandonment of remorse.\r\nFarfrae regarded him in silence; then went to the hatch and descended\r\nthrough it. Henchard would fain have recalled him, but his tongue\r\nfailed in its task, and the young man\xe2\x80\x99s steps died on his ear.\r\n\r\nHenchard took his full measure of shame and self-reproach. The scenes\r\nof his first acquaintance with Farfrae rushed back upon him\xe2\x80\x94that time\r\nwhen the curious mixture of romance and thrift in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposition so commanded his heart that Farfrae could play upon him as\r\non an instrument. So thoroughly subdued was he that he remained on the\r\nsacks in a crouching attitude, unusual for a man, and for such a man.\r\nIts womanliness sat tragically on the figure of so stern a piece of\r\nvirility. He heard a conversation below, the opening of the coach-house\r\ndoor, and the putting in of a horse, but took no notice.\r\n\r\nHere he stayed till the thin shades thickened to opaque obscurity, and\r\nthe loft-door became an oblong of gray light\xe2\x80\x94the only visible shape\r\naround. At length he arose, shook the dust from his clothes wearily,\r\nfelt his way to the hatch, and gropingly descended the steps till he\r\nstood in the yard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thought highly of me once,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cNow he\xe2\x80\x99ll hate me and\r\ndespise me for ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became possessed by an overpowering wish to see Farfrae again that\r\nnight, and by some desperate pleading to attempt the well-nigh\r\nimpossible task of winning pardon for his late mad attack. But as he\r\nwalked towards Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s door he recalled the unheeded doings in the\r\nyard while he had lain above in a sort of stupor. Farfrae he remembered\r\nhad gone to the stable and put the horse into the gig; while doing so\r\nWhittle had brought him a letter; Farfrae had then said that he would\r\nnot go towards Budmouth as he had intended\xe2\x80\x94that he was unexpectedly\r\nsummoned to Weatherbury, and meant to call at Mellstock on his way\r\nthither, that place lying but one or two miles out of his course.\r\n\r\nHe must have come prepared for a journey when he first arrived in the\r\nyard, unsuspecting enmity; and he must have driven off (though in a\r\nchanged direction) without saying a word to any one on what had\r\noccurred between themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be useless to call at Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s house till very\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it but to wait till his return, though waiting\r\nwas almost torture to his restless and self-accusing soul. He walked\r\nabout the streets and outskirts of the town, lingering here and there\r\ntill he reached the stone bridge of which mention has been made, an\r\naccustomed halting-place with him now. Here he spent a long time, the\r\npurl of waters through the weirs meeting his ear, and the Casterbridge\r\nlights glimmering at no great distance off.\r\n\r\nWhile leaning thus upon the parapet his listless attention was awakened\r\nby sounds of an unaccustomed kind from the town quarter. They were a\r\nconfusion of rhythmical noises, to which the streets added yet more\r\nconfusion by encumbering them with echoes. His first incurious thought\r\nthat the clangour arose from the town band, engaged in an attempt to\r\nround off a memorable day in a burst of evening harmony, was\r\ncontradicted by certain peculiarities of reverberation. But\r\ninexplicability did not rouse him to more than a cursory heed; his\r\nsense of degradation was too strong for the admission of foreign ideas;\r\nand he leant against the parapet as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.\r\n\r\nWhen Farfrae descended out of the loft breathless from his encounter\r\nwith Henchard, he paused at the bottom to recover himself. He arrived\r\nat the yard with the intention of putting the horse into the gig\r\nhimself (all the men having a holiday), and driving to a village on the\r\nBudmouth Road. Despite the fearful struggle he decided still to\r\npersevere in his journey, so as to recover himself before going indoors\r\nand meeting the eyes of Lucetta. He wished to consider his course in a\r\ncase so serious.\r\n\r\nWhen he was just on the point of driving off Whittle arrived with a\r\nnote badly addressed, and bearing the word \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate\xe2\x80\x9d upon the\r\noutside. On opening it he was surprised to see that it was unsigned. It\r\ncontained a brief request that he would go to Weatherbury that evening\r\nabout some business which he was conducting there. Farfrae knew nothing\r\nthat could make it pressing; but as he was bent upon going out he\r\nyielded to the anonymous request, particularly as he had a call to make\r\nat Mellstock which could be included in the same tour. Thereupon he\r\ntold Whittle of his change of direction, in words which Henchard had\r\noverheard, and set out on his way. Farfrae had not directed his man to\r\ntake the message indoors, and Whittle had not been supposed to do so on\r\nhis own responsibility.\r\n\r\nNow the anonymous letter was a well-intentioned but clumsy contrivance\r\nof Longways and other of Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s men to get him out of the way for\r\nthe evening, in order that the satirical mummery should fall flat, if\r\nit were attempted. By giving open information they would have brought\r\ndown upon their heads the vengeance of those among their comrades who\r\nenjoyed these boisterous old games; and therefore the plan of sending a\r\nletter recommended itself by its indirectness.\r\n\r\nFor poor Lucetta they took no protective measure, believing with the\r\nmajority there was some truth in the scandal, which she would have to\r\nbear as she best might.\r\n\r\nIt was about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and Lucetta was sitting in the drawing-room\r\nalone. Night had set in for more than half an hour, but she had not had\r\nthe candles lighted, for when Farfrae was away she preferred waiting\r\nfor him by the firelight, and, if it were not too cold, keeping one of\r\nthe window-sashes a little way open that the sound of his wheels might\r\nreach her ears early. She was leaning back in the chair, in a more\r\nhopeful mood than she had enjoyed since her marriage. The day had been\r\nsuch a success, and the temporary uneasiness which Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s show of\r\neffrontery had wrought in her disappeared with the quiet disappearance\r\nof Henchard himself under her husband\xe2\x80\x99s reproof. The floating evidences\r\nof her absurd passion for him, and its consequences, had been\r\ndestroyed, and she really seemed to have no cause for fear.\r\n\r\nThe reverie in which these and other subjects mingled was disturbed by\r\na hubbub in the distance, that increased moment by moment. It did not\r\ngreatly surprise her, the afternoon having been given up to recreation\r\nby a majority of the populace since the passage of the Royal equipages.\r\nBut her attention was at once riveted to the matter by the voice of a\r\nmaid-servant next door, who spoke from an upper window across the\r\nstreet to some other maid even more elevated than she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way be they going now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the first with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the second, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the\r\nmalter\xe2\x80\x99s chimbley. O yes\xe2\x80\x94I can see \xe2\x80\x99em. Well, I declare, I declare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, what?\xe2\x80\x9d from the first, more enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming up Corn Street after all! They sit back to back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94two of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94are there two figures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Two images on a donkey, back to back, their elbows tied to one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s! She\xe2\x80\x99s facing the head, and he\xe2\x80\x99s facing the tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it meant for anybody in particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it mid be. The man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere\r\nleggings; he has black whiskers, and a reddish face. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a stuffed\r\nfigure, with a falseface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe din was increasing now\xe2\x80\x94then it lessened a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94I shan\xe2\x80\x99t see, after all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the disappointed first maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have gone into a back street\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the one who\r\noccupied the enviable position in the attic. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94now I have got \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nall endways nicely!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the woman like? Just say, and I can tell in a moment if \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nmeant for one I\xe2\x80\x99ve in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis dressed just as _she_ was dressed when she sat in the\r\nfront seat at the time the play-actors came to the Town Hall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLucetta started to her feet, and almost at the instant the door of the\r\nroom was quickly and softly opened. Elizabeth-Jane advanced into the\r\nfirelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said breathlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not stop to\r\nknock\xe2\x80\x94forgive me! I see you have not shut your shutters, and the window\r\nis open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s reply she crossed quickly to the window\r\nand pulled out one of the shutters. Lucetta glided to her side. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94hush!\xe2\x80\x9d she said peremptorily, in a dry voice, while she seized\r\nElizabeth-Jane by the hand, and held up her finger. Their intercourse\r\nhad been so low and hurried that not a word had been lost of the\r\nconversation without, which had thus proceeded:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer neck is uncovered, and her hair in bands, and her back-comb in\r\nplace; she\xe2\x80\x99s got on a puce silk, and white stockings, and coloured\r\nshoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Elizabeth-Jane attempted to close the window, but Lucetta held\r\nher by main force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a face pale as death. \xe2\x80\x9cA procession\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nscandal\xe2\x80\x94an effigy of me, and him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look of Elizabeth betrayed that the latter knew it already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us shut it out,\xe2\x80\x9d coaxed Elizabeth-Jane, noting that the rigid\r\nwildness of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s features was growing yet more rigid and wild with\r\nthe meaning of the noise and laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us shut it out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of no use!\xe2\x80\x9d she shrieked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will see it, won\xe2\x80\x99t he? Donald will\r\nsee it! He is just coming home\xe2\x80\x94and it will break his heart\xe2\x80\x94he will\r\nnever love me any more\xe2\x80\x94and O, it will kill me\xe2\x80\x94kill me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane was frantic now. \xe2\x80\x9cO, can\xe2\x80\x99t something be done to stop\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there nobody to do it\xe2\x80\x94not one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe relinquished Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and ran to the door. Lucetta herself,\r\nsaying recklessly \xe2\x80\x9cI will see it!\xe2\x80\x9d turned to the window, threw up the\r\nsash, and went out upon the balcony. Elizabeth immediately followed,\r\nand put her arm round her to pull her in. Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were straight\r\nupon the spectacle of the uncanny revel, now dancing rapidly. The\r\nnumerous lights round the two effigies threw them up into lurid\r\ndistinctness; it was impossible to mistake the pair for other than the\r\nintended victims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Elizabeth; \xe2\x80\x9cand let me shut the window!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s me\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s me\xe2\x80\x94even to the parasol\xe2\x80\x94my green parasol!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lucetta\r\nwith a wild laugh as she stepped in. She stood motionless for one\r\nsecond\xe2\x80\x94then fell heavily to the floor.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the instant of her fall the rude music of the skimmington\r\nceased. The roars of sarcastic laughter went off in ripples, and the\r\ntrampling died out like the rustle of a spent wind. Elizabeth was only\r\nindirectly conscious of this; she had rung the bell, and was bending\r\nover Lucetta, who remained convulsed on the carpet in the paroxysms of\r\nan epileptic seizure. She rang again and again, in vain; the\r\nprobability being that the servants had all run out of the house to see\r\nmore of the Demoniac Sabbath than they could see within.\r\n\r\nAt last Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s man, who had been agape on the doorstep, came up;\r\nthen the cook. The shutters, hastily pushed to by Elizabeth, were quite\r\nclosed, a light was obtained, Lucetta carried to her room, and the man\r\nsent off for a doctor. While Elizabeth was undressing her she recovered\r\nconsciousness; but as soon as she remembered what had passed the fit\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe doctor arrived with unhoped-for promptitude; he had been standing\r\nat his door, like others, wondering what the uproar meant. As soon as\r\nhe saw the unhappy sufferer he said, in answer to Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s mute\r\nappeal, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fit,\xe2\x80\x9d Elizabeth said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But a fit in the present state of her health means mischief. You\r\nmust send at once for Mr. Farfrae. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has driven into the country, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the parlour-maid; \xe2\x80\x9cto some\r\nplace on the Budmouth Road. He\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be back soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, he must be sent for, in case he should not hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ndoctor returned to the bedside again. The man was despatched, and they\r\nsoon heard him clattering out of the yard at the back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Benjamin Grower, that prominent burgess of whom mention\r\nhas been already made, hearing the din of cleavers, tongs, tambourines,\r\nkits, crouds, humstrums, serpents, rams\xe2\x80\x99-horns, and other historical\r\nkinds of music as he sat indoors in the High Street, had put on his hat\r\nand gone out to learn the cause. He came to the corner above Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand soon guessed the nature of the proceedings; for being a native of\r\nthe town he had witnessed such rough jests before. His first move was\r\nto search hither and thither for the constables, there were two in the\r\ntown, shrivelled men whom he ultimately found in hiding up an alley yet\r\nmore shrivelled than usual, having some not ungrounded fears that they\r\nmight be roughly handled if seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we two poor lammigers do against such a multitude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexpostulated Stubberd, in answer to Mr. Grower\xe2\x80\x99s chiding. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\ntempting \xe2\x80\x99em to commit _felo de se_ upon us, and that would be the\r\ndeath of the perpetrator; and we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the cause of a\r\nfellow-creature\xe2\x80\x99s death on no account, not we!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet some help, then! Here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come with you. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what a few\r\nwords of authority can do. Quick now; have you got your staves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the folk to notice us as law officers, being so\r\nshort-handed, sir; so we pushed our Gover\xe2\x80\x99ment staves up this\r\nwater-pipe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with \xe2\x80\x99em, and come along, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Ah, here\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nBlowbody; that\xe2\x80\x99s lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d (Blowbody was the third of the three borough\r\nmagistrates.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the row?\xe2\x80\x9d said Blowbody. \xe2\x80\x9cGot their names\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grower to one of the constables, \xe2\x80\x9cyou go with Mr.\r\nBlowbody round by the Old Walk and come up the street; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with\r\nStubberd straight forward. By this plan we shall have \xe2\x80\x99em between us.\r\nGet their names only: no attack or interruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they started. But as Stubberd with Mr. Grower advanced into Corn\r\nStreet, whence the sounds had proceeded, they were surprised that no\r\nprocession could be seen. They passed Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s, and looked to the end\r\nof the street. The lamp flames waved, the Walk trees soughed, a few\r\nloungers stood about with their hands in their pockets. Everything was\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen a motley crowd making a disturbance?\xe2\x80\x9d Grower said\r\nmagisterially to one of these in a fustian jacket, who smoked a short\r\npipe and wore straps round his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg yer pardon, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d blandly said the person addressed, who was no\r\nother than Charl, of Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Finger. Mr. Grower repeated the words.\r\n\r\nCharl shook his head to the zero of childlike ignorance. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; we\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything; have we, Joe? And you was here afore I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoseph was quite as blank as the other in his reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s odd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grower. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94here\xe2\x80\x99s a respectable man coming\r\nthat I know by sight. Have you,\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, addressing the nearing\r\nshape of Jopp, \xe2\x80\x9chave you seen any gang of fellows making a devil of a\r\nnoise\xe2\x80\x94skimmington riding, or something of the sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no\xe2\x80\x94nothing, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Jopp replied, as if receiving the most singular\r\nnews. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been far tonight, so perhaps\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99twas here\xe2\x80\x94just here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, come to think o\xe2\x80\x99t that the wind in the Walk trees\r\nmakes a peculiar poetical-like murmur to-night, sir; more than common;\r\nso perhaps \xe2\x80\x99twas that?\xe2\x80\x9d Jopp suggested, as he rearranged his hand in\r\nhis greatcoat pocket (where it ingeniously supported a pair of kitchen\r\ntongs and a cow\xe2\x80\x99s horn, thrust up under his waistcoat).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no\xe2\x80\x94d\xe2\x80\x99ye think I\xe2\x80\x99m a fool? Constable, come this way. They must\r\nhave gone into the back street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither in back street nor in front street, however, could the\r\ndisturbers be perceived, and Blowbody and the second constable, who\r\ncame up at this time, brought similar intelligence. Effigies, donkey,\r\nlanterns, band, all had disappeared like the crew of _Comus_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Grower, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing more we can do. Get ye\r\nhalf-a-dozen helpers, and go in a body to Mixen Lane, and into Peter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nFinger. I\xe2\x80\x99m much mistaken if you don\xe2\x80\x99t find a clue to the perpetrators\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe rusty-jointed executors of the law mustered assistance as soon as\r\nthey could, and the whole party marched off to the lane of notoriety.\r\nIt was no rapid matter to get there at night, not a lamp or glimmer of\r\nany sort offering itself to light the way, except an occasional pale\r\nradiance through some window-curtain, or through the chink of some door\r\nwhich could not be closed because of the smoky chimney within. At last\r\nthey entered the inn boldly, by the till then bolted front-door, after\r\na prolonged knocking of loudness commensurate with the importance of\r\ntheir standing.\r\n\r\nIn the settles of the large room, guyed to the ceiling by cords as\r\nusual for stability, an ordinary group sat drinking and smoking with\r\nstatuesque quiet of demeanour. The landlady looked mildly at the\r\ninvaders, saying in honest accents, \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, gentlemen; there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplenty of room. I hope there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing amiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked round the room. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stubberd to one of the men,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you by now in Corn Street\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Grower spoke to \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man, who was Charl, shook his head absently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been here this\r\nlast hour, hain\xe2\x80\x99t I, Nance?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the woman who meditatively\r\nsipped her ale near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, that you have. I came in for my quiet suppertime half-pint, and\r\nyou were here then, as well as all the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other constable was facing the clock-case, where he saw reflected\r\nin the glass a quick motion by the landlady. Turning sharply, he caught\r\nher closing the oven-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething curious about that oven, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d he observed advancing,\r\nopening it, and drawing out a tambourine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said apologetically, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what we keep here to use when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a little quiet dancing. You see damp weather spoils it, so I\r\nput it there to keep it dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe constable nodded knowingly, but what he knew was nothing. Nohow\r\ncould anything be elicited from this mute and inoffensive assembly. In\r\na few minutes the investigators went out, and joining those of their\r\nauxiliaries who had been left at the door they pursued their way\r\nelsewhither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.\r\n\r\nLong before this time Henchard, weary of his ruminations on the bridge,\r\nhad repaired towards the town. When he stood at the bottom of the\r\nstreet a procession burst upon his view, in the act of turning out of\r\nan alley just above him. The lanterns, horns, and multitude startled\r\nhim; he saw the mounted images, and knew what it all meant.\r\n\r\nThey crossed the way, entered another street, and disappeared. He\r\nturned back a few steps and was lost in grave reflection, finally\r\nwending his way homeward by the obscure river-side path. Unable to rest\r\nthere he went to his stepdaughter\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and was told that\r\nElizabeth-Jane had gone to Mr. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s. Like one acting in obedience\r\nto a charm, and with a nameless apprehension, he followed in the same\r\ndirection in the hope of meeting her, the roysterers having vanished.\r\nDisappointed in this he gave the gentlest of pulls to the door-bell,\r\nand then learnt particulars of what had occurred, together with the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s imperative orders that Farfrae should be brought home, and how\r\nthey had set out to meet him on the Budmouth Road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he has gone to Mellstock and Weatherbury!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Henchard, now\r\nunspeakably grieved. \xe2\x80\x9cNot Budmouth way at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, alas! for Henchard; he had lost his good name. They would not\r\nbelieve him, taking his words but as the frothy utterances of\r\nrecklessness. Though Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s life seemed at that moment to depend\r\nupon her husband\xe2\x80\x99s return (she being in great mental agony lest he\r\nshould never know the unexaggerated truth of her past relations with\r\nHenchard), no messenger was despatched towards Weatherbury. Henchard,\r\nin a state of bitter anxiety and contrition, determined to seek Farfrae\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nTo this end he hastened down the town, ran along the eastern road over\r\nDurnover Moor, up the hill beyond, and thus onward in the moderate\r\ndarkness of this spring night till he had reached a second and almost a\r\nthird hill about three miles distant. In Yalbury Bottom, or Plain, at\r\nthe foot of the hill, he listened. At first nothing, beyond his own\r\nheart-throbs, was to be heard but the slow wind making its moan among\r\nthe masses of spruce and larch of Yalbury Wood which clothed the\r\nheights on either hand; but presently there came the sound of light\r\nwheels whetting their felloes against the newly stoned patches of road,\r\naccompanied by the distant glimmer of lights.\r\n\r\nHe knew it was Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s gig descending the hill from an indescribable\r\npersonality in its noise, the vehicle having been his own till bought\r\nby the Scotchman at the sale of his effects. Henchard thereupon\r\nretraced his steps along Yalbury Plain, the gig coming up with him as\r\nits driver slackened speed between two plantations.\r\n\r\nIt was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched\r\noff from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he\r\nhad intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple\r\nof hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the\r\nlight swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noff gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s face. At the same time Farfrae\r\ndiscerned his late antagonist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarfrae\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Farfrae!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nFarfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane\r\nbefore he pulled up. He then drew rein, and said \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d over his\r\nshoulder, as one would towards a pronounced enemy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome back to Casterbridge at once!\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nwrong at your house\xe2\x80\x94requiring your return. I\xe2\x80\x99ve run all the way here on\r\npurpose to tell ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae was silent, and at his silence Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s soul sank within him.\r\nWhy had he not, before this, thought of what was only too obvious? He\r\nwho, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle\r\nstood now in the darkness of late night-time on a lonely road, inviting\r\nhim to come a particular way, where an assailant might have\r\nconfederates, instead of going his purposed way, where there might be a\r\nbetter opportunity of guarding himself from attack. Henchard could\r\nalmost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to go to Mellstock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae coldly, as he loosened his\r\nreins to move on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d implored Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cthe matter is more serious than your\r\nbusiness at Mellstock. It is\xe2\x80\x94your wife! She is ill. I can tell you\r\nparticulars as we go along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicion that this was a _ruse_ to decoy him on to the next wood,\r\nwhere might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of\r\nnerve, Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day. He started the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you think,\xe2\x80\x9d deprecated Henchard running after, almost\r\nbowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous\r\nvillainy that he assumed in his former friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not\r\nwhat you think!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Farfrae; I have come\r\nentirely on your own and your wife\xe2\x80\x99s account. She is in danger. I know\r\nno more; and they want you to come. Your man has gone the other way in\r\na mistake. O Farfrae! don\xe2\x80\x99t mistrust me\xe2\x80\x94I am a wretched man; but my\r\nheart is true to you still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFarfrae, however, did distrust him utterly. He knew his wife was with\r\nchild, but he had left her not long ago in perfect health; and\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s treachery was more credible than his story. He had in his\r\ntime heard bitter ironies from Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s lips, and there might be\r\nironies now. He quickened the horse\xe2\x80\x99s pace, and had soon risen into the\r\nhigh country lying between there and Mellstock, Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s spasmodic\r\nrun after him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe gig and its driver lessened against the sky in Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s eyes; his\r\nexertions for Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s good had been in vain. Over this repentant\r\nsinner, at least, there was to be no joy in heaven. He cursed himself\r\nlike a less scrupulous Job, as a vehement man will do when he loses\r\nself-respect, the last mental prop under poverty. To this he had come\r\nafter a time of emotional darkness of which the adjoining woodland\r\nshade afforded inadequate illustration. Presently he began to walk back\r\nagain along the way by which he had arrived. Farfrae should at all\r\nevents have no reason for delay upon the road by seeing him there when\r\nhe took his journey homeward later on.\r\n\r\nArriving at Casterbridge Henchard went again to Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s house to make\r\ninquiries. As soon as the door opened anxious faces confronted his from\r\nthe staircase, hall, and landing; and they all said in grievous\r\ndisappointment, \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x94it is not he!\xe2\x80\x9d The manservant, finding his mistake,\r\nhad long since returned, and all hopes had centred upon Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut haven\xe2\x80\x99t you found him?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.... I cannot tell \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard replied as he sank down on a\r\nchair within the entrance. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t be home for two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon, returning upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Henchard of Elizabeth, who formed one of the group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn great danger, father. Her anxiety to see her husband makes her\r\nfearfully restless. Poor woman\xe2\x80\x94I fear they have killed her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard regarded the sympathetic speaker for a few instants as if she\r\nstruck him in a new light, then, without further remark, went out of\r\nthe door and onward to his lonely cottage. So much for man\xe2\x80\x99s rivalry,\r\nhe thought. Death was to have the oyster, and Farfrae and himself the\r\nshells. But about Elizabeth-Jane; in the midst of his gloom she seemed\r\nto him as a pin-point of light. He had liked the look on her face as\r\nshe answered him from the stairs. There had been affection in it, and\r\nabove all things what he desired now was affection from anything that\r\nwas good and pure. She was not his own, yet, for the first time, he had\r\na faint dream that he might get to like her as his own,\xe2\x80\x94if she would\r\nonly continue to love him.\r\n\r\nJopp was just going to bed when Henchard got home. As the latter\r\nentered the door Jopp said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather bad about Mrs. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard shortly, though little dreaming of Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplicity in the night\xe2\x80\x99s harlequinade, and raising his eyes just\r\nsufficiently to observe that Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s face was lined with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody has called for you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Jopp, when Henchard was\r\nshutting himself into his own apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cA kind of traveller, or\r\nsea-captain of some sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x94who could he be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed a well-be-doing man\xe2\x80\x94had grey hair and a broadish face; but\r\nhe gave no name, and no message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor do I gi\xe2\x80\x99e him any attention.\xe2\x80\x9d And, saying this, Henchard closed\r\nhis door.\r\n\r\nThe divergence to Mellstock delayed Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s return very nearly the\r\ntwo hours of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s estimate. Among the other urgent reasons for\r\nhis presence had been the need of his authority to send to Budmouth for\r\na second physician; and when at length Farfrae did come back he was in\r\na state bordering on distraction at his misconception of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nA messenger was despatched to Budmouth, late as it had grown; the night\r\nwore on, and the other doctor came in the small hours. Lucetta had been\r\nmuch soothed by Donald\xe2\x80\x99s arrival; he seldom or never left her side; and\r\nwhen, immediately after his entry, she had tried to lisp out to him the\r\nsecret which so oppressed her, he checked her feeble words, lest\r\ntalking should be dangerous, assuring her there was plenty of time to\r\ntell him everything.\r\n\r\nUp to this time he knew nothing of the skimmington-ride. The dangerous\r\nillness and miscarriage of Mrs. Farfrae was soon rumoured through the\r\ntown, and an apprehensive guess having been given as to its cause by\r\nthe leaders in the exploit, compunction and fear threw a dead silence\r\nover all particulars of their orgie; while those immediately around\r\nLucetta would not venture to add to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s distress by alluding\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nWhat, and how much, Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s wife ultimately explained to him of her\r\npast entanglement with Henchard, when they were alone in the solitude\r\nof that sad night, cannot be told. That she informed him of the bare\r\nfacts of her peculiar intimacy with the corn-merchant became plain from\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s own statements. But in respect of her subsequent conduct\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nmotive in coming to Casterbridge to unite herself with Henchard\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nassumed justification in abandoning him when she discovered reasons for\r\nfearing him (though in truth her inconsequent passion for another man\r\nat first sight had most to do with that abandonment)\xe2\x80\x94her method of\r\nreconciling to her conscience a marriage with the second when she was\r\nin a measure committed to the first: to what extent she spoke of these\r\nthings remained Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s secret alone.\r\n\r\nBesides the watchman who called the hours and weather in Casterbridge\r\nthat night there walked a figure up and down Corn Street hardly less\r\nfrequently. It was Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s, whose retiring to rest had proved itself\r\na futility as soon as attempted; and he gave it up to go hither and\r\nthither, and make inquiries about the patient every now and then. He\r\ncalled as much on Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s account as on Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s, and on\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s even more than on either\xe2\x80\x99s. Shorn one by one of all\r\nother interests, his life seemed centring on the personality of the\r\nstepdaughter whose presence but recently he could not endure. To see\r\nher on each occasion of his inquiry at Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s was a comfort to him.\r\n\r\nThe last of his calls was made about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, in\r\nthe steely light of dawn. Lucifer was fading into day across Durnover\r\nMoor, the sparrows were just alighting into the street, and the hens\r\nhad begun to cackle from the outhouses. When within a few yards of\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s he saw the door gently opened, and a servant raise her hand\r\nto the knocker, to untie the piece of cloth which had muffled it. He\r\nwent across, the sparrows in his way scarcely flying up from the\r\nroad-litter, so little did they believe in human aggression at so early\r\na time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you take off that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard.\r\n\r\nShe turned in some surprise at his presence, and did not answer for an\r\ninstant or two. Recognizing him, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause they may knock as\r\nloud as they will; she will never hear it any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI.\r\n\r\nHenchard went home. The morning having now fully broke he lit his fire,\r\nand sat abstractedly beside it. He had not sat there long when a gentle\r\nfootstep approached the house and entered the passage, a finger tapping\r\nlightly at the door. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s face brightened, for he knew the\r\nmotions to be Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s. She came into his room, looking wan and sad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Farfrae! She is\xe2\x80\x94dead! Yes,\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94about an hour ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cI have but lately come in from there. It\r\nis so very good of \xe2\x80\x99ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me. You must be so\r\ntired out, too, with sitting up. Now do you bide here with me this\r\nmorning. You can go and rest in the other room; and I will call \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nwhen breakfast is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo please him, and herself\xe2\x80\x94for his recent kindliness was winning a\r\nsurprised gratitude from the lonely girl\xe2\x80\x94she did as he bade her, and\r\nlay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a\r\nsettle in the adjoining room. She could hear him moving about in his\r\npreparations; but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death in\r\nsuch fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was\r\nappallingly unexpected. Presently she fell asleep.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in\r\nreadiness; but finding that she dozed he would not call her; he waited\r\non, looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with\r\nhouse-wifely care, as if it were an honour to have her in his house. In\r\ntruth, a great change had come over him with regard to her, and he was\r\ndeveloping the dream of a future lit by her filial presence, as though\r\nthat way alone could happiness lie.\r\n\r\nHe was disturbed by another knock at the door, and rose to open it,\r\nrather deprecating a call from anybody just then. A stoutly built man\r\nstood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure\r\nand bearing\xe2\x80\x94an air which might have been called colonial by people of\r\ncosmopolitan experience. It was the man who had asked the way at\r\nPeter\xe2\x80\x99s Finger. Henchard nodded, and looked inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, good morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger with profuse\r\nheartiness. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it Mr. Henchard I am talking to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Henchard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught \xe2\x80\x99ee at home\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Morning\xe2\x80\x99s the time for\r\nbusiness, says I. Can I have a few words with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means,\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard answered, showing the way in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d said his visitor, seating himself.\r\n\r\nHenchard observed him indifferently, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you may not. My name is Newson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s face and eyes seemed to die. The other did not notice it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow the name well,\xe2\x80\x9d Henchard said at last, looking on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make no doubt of that. Well, the fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nthis fortnight past. I landed at Havenpool and went through\r\nCasterbridge on my way to Falmouth, and when I got there, they told me\r\nyou had some years before been living at Casterbridge. Back came I\r\nagain, and by long and by late I got here by coach, ten minutes ago.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He lives down by the mill,\xe2\x80\x99 says they. So here I am. Now\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ntransaction between us some twenty years agone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis that I\xe2\x80\x99ve called\r\nabout. \xe2\x80\x99Twas a curious business. I was younger then than I am now, and\r\nperhaps the less said about it, in one sense, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious business! \xe2\x80\x99Twas worse than curious. I cannot even allow that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m the man you met then. I was not in my senses, and a man\xe2\x80\x99s senses\r\nare himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were young and thoughtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to\r\nmend matters rather than open arguments. Poor Susan\xe2\x80\x94hers was a strange\r\nexperience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was a warm-hearted, home-spun woman. She was not what they call\r\nshrewd or sharp at all\xe2\x80\x94better she had been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you in all likelihood know, she was simple-minded enough to think\r\nthat the sale was in a way binding. She was as guiltless o\xe2\x80\x99 wrong-doing\r\nin that particular as a saint in the clouds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, I know it. I found it out directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, still\r\nwith averted eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThere lay the sting o\xe2\x80\x99t to me. If she had seen it\r\nas what it was she would never have left me. Never! But how should she\r\nbe expected to know? What advantages had she? None. She could write her\r\nown name, and no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was not in my heart to undeceive her when the deed was done,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the sailor of former days. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, and there was not much\r\nvanity in thinking it, that she would be happier with me. She was\r\nfairly happy, and I never would have undeceived her till the day of her\r\ndeath. Your child died; she had another, and all went well. But a time\r\ncame\xe2\x80\x94mind me, a time always does come. A time came\xe2\x80\x94it was some while\r\nafter she and I and the child returned from America\xe2\x80\x94when somebody she\r\nhad confided her history to, told her my claim to her was a mockery,\r\nand made a jest of her belief in my right. After that she was never\r\nhappy with me. She pined and pined, and socked and sighed. She said she\r\nmust leave me, and then came the question of our child. Then a man\r\nadvised me how to act, and I did it, for I thought it was best. I left\r\nher at Falmouth, and went off to sea. When I got to the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic there was a storm, and it was supposed that a lot of us,\r\nincluding myself, had been washed overboard. I got ashore at\r\nNewfoundland, and then I asked myself what I should do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Since I\xe2\x80\x99m here, here I\xe2\x80\x99ll bide,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought to myself; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99twill be most\r\nkindness to her, now she\xe2\x80\x99s taken against me, to let her believe me\r\nlost, for,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, \xe2\x80\x98while she supposes us both alive she\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nmiserable; but if she thinks me dead she\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to him, and the\r\nchild will have a home.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never returned to this country till a\r\nmonth ago, and I found that, as I supposed, she went to you, and my\r\ndaughter with her. They told me in Falmouth that Susan was dead. But my\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94where is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard doggedly. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely you learnt that too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sailor started up, and took an enervated pace or two down the room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of my money to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard, without answering, shook his head as if that were rather a\r\nquestion for Newson himself than for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she buried?\xe2\x80\x9d the traveller inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeside her mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, in the same stolid tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did she die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA year ago and more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe sailor continued standing. Henchard never looked up from the floor.\r\nAt last Newson said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy journey hither has been for nothing! I may as\r\nwell go as I came! It has served me right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded\r\nfloor, the mechanical lifting of the latch, the slow opening and\r\nclosing of the door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man; but\r\nhe did not turn his head. Newson\xe2\x80\x99s shadow passed the window. He was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThen Henchard, scarcely believing the evidence of his senses, rose from\r\nhis seat amazed at what he had done. It had been the impulse of a\r\nmoment. The regard he had lately acquired for Elizabeth, the new-sprung\r\nhope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he\r\ncould feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed\r\nherself to be, had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson\r\nto a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her; so that the sudden\r\nprospect of her loss had caused him to speak mad lies like a child, in\r\npure mockery of consequences. He had expected questions to close in\r\nround him, and unmask his fabrication in five minutes; yet such\r\nquestioning had not come. But surely they would come; Newson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture could be but momentary; he would learn all by inquiries in\r\nthe town; and return to curse him, and carry his last treasure away!\r\n\r\nHe hastily put on his hat, and went out in the direction that Newson\r\nhad taken. Newson\xe2\x80\x99s back was soon visible up the road, crossing\r\nBull-stake. Henchard followed, and saw his visitor stop at the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArms, where the morning coach which had brought him waited half-an-hour\r\nfor another coach which crossed there. The coach Newson had come by was\r\nnow about to move again. Newson mounted, his luggage was put in, and in\r\na few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him.\r\n\r\nHe had not so much as turned his head. It was an act of simple faith in\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s words\xe2\x80\x94faith so simple as to be almost sublime. The young\r\nsailor who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on\r\nthe faith of a glance at her face, more than twenty years before, was\r\nstill living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who\r\nhad taken Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nWas Elizabeth-Jane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a\r\nmoment? \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not for long,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. Newson might converse with his\r\nfellow-travellers, some of whom might be Casterbridge people; and the\r\ntrick would be discovered.\r\n\r\nThis probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude, and instead\r\nof considering how best to right the wrong, and acquaint Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather with the truth at once, he bethought himself of ways to keep the\r\nposition he had accidentally won. Towards the young woman herself his\r\naffection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his\r\nclaim to her was exposed.\r\n\r\nHe watched the distant highway expecting to see Newson return on foot,\r\nenlightened and indignant, to claim his child. But no figure appeared.\r\nPossibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach, but buried his grief in\r\nhis own heart.\r\n\r\nHis grief!\xe2\x80\x94what was it, after all, to that which he, Henchard, would\r\nfeel at the loss of her? Newson\xe2\x80\x99s affection cooled by years, could not\r\nequal his who had been constantly in her presence. And thus his jealous\r\nsoul speciously argued to excuse the separation of father and child.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the house half expecting that she would have vanished.\r\nNo; there she was\xe2\x80\x94just coming out from the inner room, the marks of\r\nsleep upon her eyelids, and exhibiting a generally refreshed air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father!\xe2\x80\x9d she said smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no sooner lain down than I napped,\r\nthough I did not mean to. I wonder I did not dream about poor Mrs.\r\nFarfrae, after thinking of her so; but I did not. How strange it is\r\nthat we do not often dream of latest events, absorbing as they may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you have been able to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking her hand with\r\nanxious proprietorship\xe2\x80\x94an act which gave her a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to breakfast, and Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts reverted to\r\nLucetta. Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had\r\never lain in its meditative soberness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread\r\nmeal, \xe2\x80\x9cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own\r\nhands, and I idly asleep the while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do it every day,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have left me; everybody has left\r\nme; how should I live but by my own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very lonely, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, child\xe2\x80\x94to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault.\r\nYou are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come\r\nno more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that\r\nElizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not\r\nask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what\r\nElizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear\r\napart from her.\r\n\r\nWhen they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the\r\nmoment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily\r\nwork. Then she arose, and with assurance of coming again soon went up\r\nthe hill in the morning sunlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her,\r\nshe would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking! Yet\r\nbefore the evening probably he will have come, and then she will scorn\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself,\r\naccompanied him everywhere through the day. His mood was no longer that\r\nof the rebellious, ironical, reckless misadventurer; but the leaden\r\ngloom of one who has lost all that can make life interesting, or even\r\ntolerable. There would remain nobody for him to be proud of, nobody to\r\nfortify him; for Elizabeth-Jane would soon be but as a stranger, and\r\nworse. Susan, Farfrae, Lucetta, Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x94all had gone from him, one\r\nafter one, either by his fault or by his misfortune.\r\n\r\nIn place of them he had no interest, hobby, or desire. If he could have\r\nsummoned music to his aid his existence might even now have been borne;\r\nfor with Henchard music was of regal power. The merest trumpet or organ\r\ntone was enough to move him, and high harmonies transubstantiated him.\r\nBut hard fate had ordained that he should be unable to call up this\r\nDivine spirit in his need.\r\n\r\nThe whole land ahead of him was as darkness itself; there was nothing\r\nto come, nothing to wait for. Yet in the natural course of life he\r\nmight possibly have to linger on earth another thirty or forty\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94scoffed at; at best pitied.\r\n\r\nThe thought of it was unendurable.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Casterbridge lay moors and meadows through which much\r\nwater flowed. The wanderer in this direction who should stand still for\r\na few moments on a quiet night, might hear singular symphonies from\r\nthese waters, as from a lampless orchestra, all playing in their sundry\r\ntones from near and far parts of the moor. At a hole in a rotten weir\r\nthey executed a recitative; where a tributary brook fell over a stone\r\nbreastwork they trilled cheerily; under an arch they performed a\r\nmetallic cymballing, and at Durnover Hole they hissed. The spot at\r\nwhich their instrumentation rose loudest was a place called Ten\r\nHatches, whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nThe river here was deep and strong at all times, and the hatches on\r\nthis account were raised and lowered by cogs and a winch. A path led\r\nfrom the second bridge over the highway (so often mentioned) to these\r\nHatches, crossing the stream at their head by a narrow plank-bridge.\r\nBut after night-fall human beings were seldom found going that way, the\r\npath leading only to a deep reach of the stream called Blackwater, and\r\nthe passage being dangerous.\r\n\r\nHenchard, however, leaving the town by the east road, proceeded to the\r\nsecond, or stone bridge, and thence struck into this path of solitude,\r\nfollowing its course beside the stream till the dark shapes of the Ten\r\nHatches cut the sheen thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that\r\nstill lingered in the west. In a second or two he stood beside the\r\nweir-hole where the water was at its deepest. He looked backwards and\r\nforwards, and no creature appeared in view. He then took off his coat\r\nand hat, and stood on the brink of the stream with his hands clasped in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nWhile his eyes were bent on the water beneath there slowly became\r\nvisible a something floating in the circular pool formed by the wash of\r\ncenturies; the pool he was intending to make his death-bed. At first it\r\nwas indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank; but it emerged\r\nthence and took shape, which was that of a human body, lying stiff and\r\nstark upon the surface of the stream.\r\n\r\nIn the circular current imparted by the central flow the form was\r\nbrought forward, till it passed under his eyes; and then he perceived\r\nwith a sense of horror that it was _himself_. Not a man somewhat\r\nresembling him, but one in all respects his counterpart, his actual\r\ndouble, was floating as if dead in Ten Hatches Hole.\r\n\r\nThe sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man, and he\r\nturned away as one might have done in the actual presence of an\r\nappalling miracle. He covered his eyes and bowed his head. Without\r\nlooking again into the stream he took his coat and hat, and went slowly\r\naway.\r\n\r\nPresently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling. To his\r\nsurprise Elizabeth-Jane was standing there. She came forward, spoke,\r\ncalled him \xe2\x80\x9cfather\xe2\x80\x9d just as before. Newson, then, had not even yet\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you seemed very sad this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cso I have come\r\nagain to see you. Not that I am anything but sad myself. But everybody\r\nand everything seem against you so, and I know you must be suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow this woman divined things! Yet she had not divined their whole\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nHe said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cAre miracles still worked, do ye think, Elizabeth? I\r\nam not a read man. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know so much as I could wish. I have tried\r\nto peruse and learn all my life; but the more I try to know the more\r\nignorant I seem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite think there are any miracles nowadays,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo interference in the case of desperate intentions, for instance?\r\nWell, perhaps not, in a direct way. Perhaps not. But will you come and\r\nwalk with me, and I will show \xe2\x80\x99ee what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe agreed willingly, and he took her over the highway, and by the\r\nlonely path to Ten Hatches. He walked restlessly, as if some haunting\r\nshade, unseen of her, hovered round him and troubled his glance. She\r\nwould gladly have talked of Lucetta, but feared to disturb him. When\r\nthey got near the weir he stood still, and asked her to go forward and\r\nlook into the pool, and tell him what she saw.\r\n\r\nShe went, and soon returned to him. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard, \xe2\x80\x9cand look narrowly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe proceeded to the river brink a second time. On her return, after\r\nsome delay, she told him that she saw something floating round and\r\nround there; but what it was she could not discern. It seemed to be a\r\nbundle of old clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they like mine?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Henchard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94they are. Dear me\xe2\x80\x94I wonder if\xe2\x80\x94Father, let us go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and look once more; and then we will get home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went back, and he could see her stoop till her head was close to\r\nthe margin of the pool. She started up, and hastened back to his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you say now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me\xe2\x80\x94do\xe2\x80\x94what is it floating there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe effigy,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must have thrown it into the\r\nriver higher up amongst the willows at Blackwater, to get rid of it in\r\ntheir alarm at discovery by the magistrates, and it must have floated\r\ndown here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94to be sure\xe2\x80\x94the image o\xe2\x80\x99 me! But where is the other? Why that one\r\nonly?... That performance of theirs killed her, but kept me alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane thought and thought of these words \xe2\x80\x9ckept me alive,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthey slowly retraced their way to the town, and at length guessed their\r\nmeaning. \xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x94I will not leave you alone like this!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do? I do not mind\r\nyour being poor. I would have agreed to come this morning, but you did\r\nnot ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay you come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cElizabeth, don\xe2\x80\x99t mock me! If\r\nyou only would come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you forgive all my roughness in former days? You cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten it. Talk of that no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus she assured him, and arranged their plans for reunion; and at\r\nlength each went home. Then Henchard shaved for the first time during\r\nmany days, and put on clean linen, and combed his hair; and was as a\r\nman resuscitated thenceforward.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the fact turned out to be as Elizabeth-Jane had\r\nstated; the effigy was discovered by a cowherd, and that of Lucetta a\r\nlittle higher up in the same stream. But as little as possible was said\r\nof the matter, and the figures were privately destroyed.\r\n\r\nDespite this natural solution of the mystery Henchard no less regarded\r\nit as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there.\r\nElizabeth-Jane heard him say, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is such a reprobate as I! And yet it\r\nseems that even I be in Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII.\r\n\r\nBut the emotional conviction that he was in Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s hand began to\r\ndie out of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s breast as time slowly removed into distance the\r\nevent which had given that feeling birth. The apparition of Newson\r\nhaunted him. He would surely return.\r\n\r\nYet Newson did not arrive. Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard\r\npath; Casterbridge had for the last time turned its regard upon her,\r\nbefore proceeding to its work as if she had never lived. But Elizabeth\r\nremained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard, and\r\nnow shared his home. Perhaps, after all, Newson was gone for ever.\r\n\r\nIn due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the, at least, proximate\r\ncause of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s illness and death, and his first impulse was\r\nnaturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the\r\nperpetrators of the mischief. He resolved to wait till the funeral was\r\nover ere he moved in the matter. The time having come he reflected.\r\nDisastrous as the result had been, it was obviously in no way foreseen\r\nor intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession.\r\nThe tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the\r\nhead of affairs\xe2\x80\x94that supreme and piquant enjoyment of those who writhe\r\nunder the heel of the same\xe2\x80\x94had alone animated them, so far as he could\r\nsee; for he knew nothing of Jopp\xe2\x80\x99s incitements. Other considerations\r\nwere also involved. Lucetta had confessed everything to him before her\r\ndeath, and it was not altogether desirable to make much ado about her\r\nhistory, alike for her sake, for Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s, and for his own. To regard\r\nthe event as an untoward accident seemed, to Farfrae, truest\r\nconsideration for the dead one\xe2\x80\x99s memory, as well as best philosophy.\r\n\r\nHenchard and himself mutually forbore to meet. For Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s sake the\r\nformer had fettered his pride sufficiently to accept the small seed and\r\nroot business which some of the Town Council, headed by Farfrae, had\r\npurchased to afford him a new opening. Had he been only personally\r\nconcerned Henchard, without doubt, would have declined assistance even\r\nremotely brought about by the man whom he had so fiercely assailed. But\r\nthe sympathy of the girl seemed necessary to his very existence; and on\r\nher account pride itself wore the garments of humility.\r\n\r\nHere they settled themselves; and on each day of their lives Henchard\r\nanticipated her every wish with a watchfulness in which paternal regard\r\nwas heightened by a burning jealous dread of rivalry. Yet that Newson\r\nwould ever now return to Casterbridge to claim her as a daughter there\r\nwas little reason to suppose. He was a wanderer and a stranger, almost\r\nan alien; he had not seen his daughter for several years; his affection\r\nfor her could not in the nature of things be keen; other interests\r\nwould probably soon obscure his recollections of her, and prevent any\r\nsuch renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that\r\nshe was still a creature of the present. To satisfy his conscience\r\nsomewhat Henchard repeated to himself that the lie which had retained\r\nfor him the coveted treasure had not been deliberately told to that\r\nend, but had come from him as the last defiant word of a despair which\r\ntook no thought of consequences. Furthermore he pleaded within himself\r\nthat no Newson could love her as he loved her, or would tend her to his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s extremity as he was prepared to do cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThus they lived on in the shop overlooking the churchyard, and nothing\r\noccurred to mark their days during the remainder of the year. Going out\r\nbut seldom, and never on a marketday, they saw Donald Farfrae only at\r\nrarest intervals, and then mostly as a transitory object in the\r\ndistance of the street. Yet he was pursuing his ordinary avocations,\r\nsmiling mechanically to fellow-tradesmen, and arguing with\r\nbargainers\xe2\x80\x94as bereaved men do after a while.\r\n\r\nTime, \xe2\x80\x9cin his own grey style,\xe2\x80\x9d taught Farfrae how to estimate his\r\nexperience of Lucetta\xe2\x80\x94all that it was, and all that it was not. There\r\nare men whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or\r\ncause thrown by chance into their keeping, long after their judgment\r\nhas pronounced it no rarity\xe2\x80\x94even the reverse, indeed, and without them\r\nthe band of the worthy is incomplete. But Farfrae was not of those. It\r\nwas inevitable that the insight, briskness, and rapidity of his nature\r\nshould take him out of the dead blank which his loss threw about him.\r\nHe could not but perceive that by the death of Lucetta he had exchanged\r\na looming misery for a simple sorrow. After that revelation of her\r\nhistory, which must have come sooner or later in any circumstances, it\r\nwas hard to believe that life with her would have been productive of\r\nfurther happiness.\r\n\r\nBut as a memory, nothwithstanding such conditions, Lucetta\xe2\x80\x99s image\r\nstill lived on with him, her weaknesses provoking only the gentlest\r\ncriticism, and her sufferings attenuating wrath at her concealments to\r\na momentary spark now and then.\r\n\r\nBy the end of a year Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s little retail seed and grain shop, not\r\nmuch larger than a cupboard, had developed its trade considerably, and\r\nthe stepfather and daughter enjoyed much serenity in the pleasant,\r\nsunny corner in which it stood. The quiet bearing of one who brimmed\r\nwith an inner activity characterized Elizabeth-Jane at this period. She\r\ntook long walks into the country two or three times a week, mostly in\r\nthe direction of Budmouth. Sometimes it occurred to him that when she\r\nsat with him in the evening after those invigorating walks she was\r\ncivil rather than affectionate; and he was troubled; one more bitter\r\nregret being added to those he had already experienced at having, by\r\nhis severe censorship, frozen up her precious affection when originally\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nShe had her own way in everything now. In going and coming, in buying\r\nand selling, her word was law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got a new muff, Elizabeth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her one day quite\r\nhumbly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I bought it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it again as it lay on an adjoining table. The fur was of a\r\nglossy brown, and, though he was no judge of such articles, he thought\r\nit seemed an unusually good one for her to possess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather costly, I suppose, my dear, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d he hazarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was rather above my figure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not\r\nshowy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the netted lion, anxious not to pique her in the least.\r\n\r\nSome little time after, when the year had advanced into another spring,\r\nhe paused opposite her empty bedroom in passing it. He thought of the\r\ntime when she had cleared out of his then large and handsome house in\r\nCorn Street, in consequence of his dislike and harshness, and he had\r\nlooked into her chamber in just the same way. The present room was much\r\nhumbler, but what struck him about it was the abundance of books lying\r\neverywhere. Their number and quality made the meagre furniture that\r\nsupported them seem absurdly disproportionate. Some, indeed many, must\r\nhave been recently purchased; and though he encouraged her to buy in\r\nreason, he had no notion that she indulged her innate passion so\r\nextensively in proportion to the narrowness of their income. For the\r\nfirst time he felt a little hurt by what he thought her extravagance,\r\nand resolved to say a word to her about it. But, before he had found\r\nthe courage to speak an event happened which set his thoughts flying in\r\nquite another direction.\r\n\r\nThe busy time of the seed trade was over, and the quiet weeks that\r\npreceded the hay-season had come\xe2\x80\x94setting their special stamp upon\r\nCasterbridge by thronging the market with wood rakes, new waggons in\r\nyellow, green, and red, formidable scythes, and pitchforks of prong\r\nsufficient to skewer up a small family. Henchard, contrary to his wont,\r\nwent out one Saturday afternoon towards the market-place from a curious\r\nfeeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his\r\nformer triumphs. Farfrae, to whom he was still a comparative stranger,\r\nstood a few steps below the Corn Exchange door\xe2\x80\x94a usual position with\r\nhim at this hour\xe2\x80\x94and he appeared lost in thought about something he was\r\nlooking at a little way off.\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s, and he saw that the object of his\r\ngaze was no sample-showing farmer, but his own stepdaughter, who had\r\njust come out of a shop over the way. She, on her part, was quite\r\nunconscious of his attention, and in this was less fortunate than those\r\nyoung women whose very plumes, like those of Juno\xe2\x80\x99s bird, are set with\r\nArgus eyes whenever possible admirers are within ken.\r\n\r\nHenchard went away, thinking that perhaps there was nothing significant\r\nafter all in Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s look at Elizabeth-Jane at that juncture. Yet he\r\ncould not forget that the Scotchman had once shown a tender interest in\r\nher, of a fleeting kind. Thereupon promptly came to the surface that\r\nidiosyncrasy of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s which had ruled his courses from the\r\nbeginning and had mainly made him what he was. Instead of thinking that\r\na union between his cherished stepdaughter and the energetic thriving\r\nDonald was a thing to be desired for her good and his own, he hated the\r\nvery possibility.\r\n\r\nTime had been when such instinctive opposition would have taken shape\r\nin action. But he was not now the Henchard of former days. He schooled\r\nhimself to accept her will, in this as in other matters, as absolute\r\nand unquestionable. He dreaded lest an antagonistic word should lose\r\nfor him such regard as he had regained from her by his devotion,\r\nfeeling that to retain this under separation was better than to incur\r\nher dislike by keeping her near.\r\n\r\nBut the mere thought of such separation fevered his spirit much, and in\r\nthe evening he said, with the stillness of suspense: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Mr.\r\nFarfrae to-day, Elizabeth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane started at the question; and it was with some confusion\r\nthat she replied \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s right.... It was only that I saw him in the\r\nstreet when we both were there.\xe2\x80\x9d He was wondering if her embarrassment\r\njustified him in a new suspicion\xe2\x80\x94that the long walks which she had\r\nlatterly been taking, that the new books which had so surprised him,\r\nhad anything to do with the young man. She did not enlighten him, and\r\nlest silence should allow her to shape thoughts unfavourable to their\r\npresent friendly relations, he diverted the discourse into another\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nHenchard was, by original make, the last man to act stealthily, for\r\ngood or for evil. But the _solicitus timor_ of his love\xe2\x80\x94the dependence\r\nupon Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s regard into which he had declined (or, in another\r\nsense, to which he had advanced)\xe2\x80\x94denaturalized him. He would often\r\nweigh and consider for hours together the meaning of such and such a\r\ndeed or phrase of hers, when a blunt settling question would formerly\r\nhave been his first instinct. And now, uneasy at the thought of a\r\npassion for Farfrae which should entirely displace her mild filial\r\nsympathy with himself, he observed her going and coming more narrowly.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing secret in Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s movements beyond what\r\nhabitual reserve induced, and it may at once be owned on her account\r\nthat she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they\r\nchanced to meet. Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth Road,\r\nher return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes\xe2\x80\x99 blow on that rather\r\nwindy highway\xe2\x80\x94just to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before\r\nsitting down to tea, as he said. Henchard became aware of this by going\r\nto the Ring, and, screened by its enclosure, keeping his eye upon the\r\nroad till he saw them meet. His face assumed an expression of extreme\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her, too, he means to rob me!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he has the right.\r\nI do not wish to interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe meeting, in truth, was of a very innocent kind, and matters were by\r\nno means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s jealous\r\ngrief inferred. Could he have heard such conversation as passed he\r\nwould have been enlightened thus much:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_He_.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou like walking this way, Miss Henchard\xe2\x80\x94and is it not so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(uttered in his undulatory accents, and with an appraising, pondering\r\ngaze at her).\r\n\r\n_She_.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO yes. I have chosen this road latterly. I have no great reason\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_He_.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut that may make a reason for others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_She_ (reddening).\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that. My reason, however, such as it\r\nis, is that I wish to get a glimpse of the sea every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_He_.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a secret why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_She_ ( reluctantly ).\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_He_ (with the pathos of one of his native ballads).\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I doubt there\r\nwill be any good in secrets! A secret cast a deep shadow over my life.\r\nAnd well you know what it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth admitted that she did, but she refrained from confessing why\r\nthe sea attracted her. She could not herself account for it fully, not\r\nknowing the secret possibly to be that, in addition to early marine\r\nassociations, her blood was a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for those new books, Mr. Farfrae,\xe2\x80\x9d she added shyly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder if I ought to accept so many!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! why not? It gives me more pleasure to get them for you, than you\r\nto have them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey proceeded along the road together till they reached the town, and\r\ntheir paths diverged.\r\n\r\nHenchard vowed that he would leave them to their own devices, put\r\nnothing in the way of their courses, whatever they might mean. If he\r\nwere doomed to be bereft of her, so it must be. In the situation which\r\ntheir marriage would create he could see no _locus standi_ for himself\r\nat all. Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously; his\r\npoverty ensured that, no less than his past conduct. And so Elizabeth\r\nwould grow to be a stranger to him, and the end of his life would be\r\nfriendless solitude.\r\n\r\nWith such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness.\r\nIndeed, within certain lines, he had the right to keep an eye upon her\r\nas his charge. The meetings seemed to become matters of course with\r\nthem on special days of the week.\r\n\r\nAt last full proof was given him. He was standing behind a wall close\r\nto the place at which Farfrae encountered her. He heard the young man\r\naddress her as \xe2\x80\x9cDearest Elizabeth-Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d and then kiss her, the girl\r\nlooking quickly round to assure herself that nobody was near.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone their way Henchard came out from the wall, and\r\nmournfully followed them to Casterbridge. The chief looming trouble in\r\nthis engagement had not decreased. Both Farfrae and Elizabeth-Jane,\r\nunlike the rest of the people, must suppose Elizabeth to be his actual\r\ndaughter, from his own assertion while he himself had the same belief;\r\nand though Farfrae must have so far forgiven him as to have no\r\nobjection to own him as a father-in-law, intimate they could never be.\r\nThus would the girl, who was his only friend, be withdrawn from him by\r\ndegrees through her husband\xe2\x80\x99s influence, and learn to despise him.\r\n\r\nHad she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he\r\nhad rivalled, cursed, wrestled with for life in days before his spirit\r\nwas broken, Henchard would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am content.\xe2\x80\x9d But content with\r\nthe prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire.\r\n\r\nThere is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned,\r\nunsolicited, and of noxious kind, are sometimes allowed to wander for a\r\nmoment prior to being sent off whence they came. One of these thoughts\r\nsailed into Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s ken now.\r\n\r\nSuppose he were to communicate to Farfrae the fact that his betrothed\r\nwas not the child of Michael Henchard at all\xe2\x80\x94legally, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s child;\r\nhow would that correct and leading townsman receive the information? He\r\nmight possibly forsake Elizabeth-Jane, and then she would be her\r\nstep-sire\xe2\x80\x99s own again.\r\n\r\nHenchard shuddered, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid such a thing! Why should\r\nI still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so\r\nhard to keep him away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII.\r\n\r\nWhat Henchard saw thus early was, naturally enough, seen at a little\r\nlater date by other people. That Mr. Farfrae \xe2\x80\x9cwalked with that bankrupt\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s stepdaughter, of all women,\xe2\x80\x9d became a common topic in the\r\ntown, the simple perambulating term being used hereabout to signify a\r\nwooing; and the nineteen superior young ladies of Casterbridge, who had\r\neach looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the\r\nmerchant Councilman happy, indignantly left off going to the church\r\nFarfrae attended, left off conscious mannerisms, left off putting him\r\nin their prayers at night amongst their blood relations; in short,\r\nreverted to their normal courses.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the only inhabitants of the town to whom this looming choice of\r\nthe Scotchman\xe2\x80\x99s gave unmixed satisfaction were the members of the\r\nphilosophic party, which included Longways, Christopher Coney, Billy\r\nWills, Mr. Buzzford, and the like. The Three Mariners having been,\r\nyears before, the house in which they had witnessed the young man and\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s first and humble appearance on the Casterbridge stage, they\r\ntook a kindly interest in their career, not unconnected, perhaps, with\r\nvisions of festive treatment at their hands hereafter. Mrs. Stannidge,\r\nhaving rolled into the large parlour one evening and said that it was a\r\nwonder such a man as Mr. Farfrae, \xe2\x80\x9ca pillow of the town,\xe2\x80\x9d who might\r\nhave chosen one of the daughters of the professional men or private\r\nresidents, should stoop so low, Coney ventured to disagree with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, no wonder at all. \xe2\x80\x99Tis she that\xe2\x80\x99s a stooping to he\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy opinion. A widow man\xe2\x80\x94whose first wife was no credit to him\xe2\x80\x94what is\r\nit for a young perusing woman that\xe2\x80\x99s her own mistress and well liked?\r\nBut as a neat patching up of things I see much good in it. When a man\r\nhave put up a tomb of best marble-stone to the other one, as he\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone, and weeped his fill, and thought it all over, and said to\r\nhisself, \xe2\x80\x98T\xe2\x80\x99other took me in, I knowed this one first; she\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible\r\npiece for a partner, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no faithful woman in high life\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x99;\xe2\x80\x94well, he may do worse than not to take her, if she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntender-inclined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they talked at the Mariners. But we must guard against a too\r\nliberal use of the conventional declaration that a great sensation was\r\ncaused by the prospective event, that all the gossips\xe2\x80\x99 tongues were set\r\nwagging thereby, and so-on, even though such a declaration might lend\r\nsome eclat to the career of our poor only heroine. When all has been\r\nsaid about busy rumourers, a superficial and temporary thing is the\r\ninterest of anybody in affairs which do not directly touch them. It\r\nwould be a truer representation to say that Casterbridge (ever\r\nexcepting the nineteen young ladies) looked up for a moment at the\r\nnews, and withdrawing its attention, went on labouring and victualling,\r\nbringing up its children, and burying its dead, without caring a tittle\r\nfor Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s domestic plans.\r\n\r\nNot a hint of the matter was thrown out to her stepfather by Elizabeth\r\nherself or by Farfrae either. Reasoning on the cause of their reticence\r\nhe concluded that, estimating him by his past, the throbbing pair were\r\nafraid to broach the subject, and looked upon him as an irksome\r\nobstacle whom they would be heartily glad to get out of the way.\r\nEmbittered as he was against society, this moody view of himself took\r\ndeeper and deeper hold of Henchard, till the daily necessity of facing\r\nmankind, and of them particularly Elizabeth-Jane, became well-nigh more\r\nthan he could endure. His health declined; he became morbidly\r\nsensitive. He wished he could escape those who did not want him, and\r\nhide his head for ever.\r\n\r\nBut what if he were mistaken in his views, and there were no necessity\r\nthat his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the\r\nincident of her marriage?\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to draw a picture of the alternative\xe2\x80\x94himself living like a\r\nfangless lion about the back rooms of a house in which his stepdaughter\r\nwas mistress, an inoffensive old man, tenderly smiled on by Elizabeth,\r\nand good-naturedly tolerated by her husband. It was terrible to his\r\npride to think of descending so low; and yet, for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s sake he\r\nmight put up with anything; even from Farfrae; even snubbings and\r\nmasterful tongue-scourgings. The privilege of being in the house she\r\noccupied would almost outweigh the personal humiliation.\r\n\r\nWhether this were a dim possibility or the reverse, the courtship\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nit evidently now was\xe2\x80\x94had an absorbing interest for him.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, as has been said, often took her walks on the Budmouth Road,\r\nand Farfrae as often made it convenient to create an accidental meeting\r\nwith her there. Two miles out, a quarter of a mile from the highway,\r\nwas the prehistoric fort called Mai Dun, of huge dimensions and many\r\nramparts, within or upon whose enclosures a human being as seen from\r\nthe road, was but an insignificant speck. Hitherward Henchard often\r\nresorted, glass in hand, and scanned the hedgeless _Via_\xe2\x80\x94for it was the\r\noriginal track laid out by the legions of the Empire\xe2\x80\x94to a distance of\r\ntwo or three miles, his object being to read the progress of affairs\r\nbetween Farfrae and his charmer.\r\n\r\nOne day Henchard was at this spot when a masculine figure came along\r\nthe road from Budmouth, and lingered. Applying his telescope to his eye\r\nHenchard expected that Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s features would be disclosed as usual.\r\nBut the lenses revealed that today the man was not Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nIt was one clothed as a merchant captain, and as he turned in the\r\nscrutiny of the road he revealed his face. Henchard lived a lifetime\r\nthe moment he saw it. The face was Newson\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHenchard dropped the glass, and for some seconds made no other\r\nmovement. Newson waited, and Henchard waited\xe2\x80\x94if that could be called a\r\nwaiting which was a transfixture. But Elizabeth-Jane did not come.\r\nSomething or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that\r\nday. Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for variety\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. But what did that amount to? She might be here to-morrow, and in\r\nany case Newson, if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the\r\ntruth to her, would soon make his opportunity.\r\n\r\nThen he would tell her not only of his paternity, but of the ruse by\r\nwhich he had been once sent away. Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s strict nature would cause\r\nher for the first time to despise her stepfather, would root out his\r\nimage as that of an arch-deceiver, and Newson would reign in her heart\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\nBut Newson did not see anything of her that morning. Having stood still\r\nawhile he at last retraced his steps, and Henchard felt like a\r\ncondemned man who has a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 respite. When he reached his own\r\nhouse he found her there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father!\xe2\x80\x9d she said innocently. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had a letter\xe2\x80\x94a strange one\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nsigned. Somebody has asked me to meet him, either on the Budmouth Road\r\nat noon today, or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s. He says he came to\r\nsee me some time ago, but a trick was played him, so that he did not\r\nsee me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it; but between you and me I think Donald is\r\nat the bottom of the mystery, and that it is a relation of his who\r\nwants to pass an opinion on his choice. But I did not like to go till I\r\nhad seen you. Shall I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard replied heavily, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of\r\nby this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to\r\nstand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And\r\nbeing an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he\r\nresolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while\r\nimmediately taking his measures.\r\n\r\nHe surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this\r\nworld by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave Casterbridge!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave\xe2\x80\x94me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us\r\nboth; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about shops and streets and folk\xe2\x80\x94I would rather get\r\ninto the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and\r\nleave you to yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down and her tears fell silently. It seemed to her that this\r\nresolve of his had come on account of her attachment and its probable\r\nresult. She showed her devotion to Farfrae, however, by mastering her\r\nemotion and speaking out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you have decided on this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with difficult\r\nfirmness. \xe2\x80\x9cFor I thought it probable\xe2\x80\x94possible\xe2\x80\x94that I might marry Mr.\r\nFarfrae some little time hence, and I did not know that you disapproved\r\nof the step!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI approve of anything you desire to do, Izzy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard huskily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not approve it would be no matter! I wish to go away. My\r\npresence might make things awkward in the future, and, in short, it is\r\nbest that I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing that her affection could urge would induce him to reconsider\r\nhis determination; for she could not urge what she did not know\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwhen she should learn he was not related to her other than as a\r\nstep-parent she would refrain from despising him, and that when she\r\nknew what he had done to keep her in ignorance she would refrain from\r\nhating him. It was his conviction that she would not so refrain; and\r\nthere existed as yet neither word nor event which could argue it away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not be able to come to my wedding;\r\nand that is not as it ought to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; adding\r\nmore softly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut think of me sometimes in your future life\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nthat, Izzy?\xe2\x80\x94think of me when you are living as the wife of the richest,\r\nthe foremost man in the town, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let my sins, _when you know\r\nthem all_, cause \xe2\x80\x99ee to quite forget that though I loved \xe2\x80\x99ee late I\r\nloved \xe2\x80\x99ee well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because of Donald!\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t forbid you to marry him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henchard. \xe2\x80\x9cPromise not to quite\r\nforget me when\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He meant when Newson should come.\r\n\r\nShe promised mechanically, in her agitation; and the same evening at\r\ndusk Henchard left the town, to whose development he had been one of\r\nthe chief stimulants for many years. During the day he had bought a new\r\ntool-basket, cleaned up his old hay-knife and wimble, set himself up in\r\nfresh leggings, kneenaps and corduroys, and in other ways gone back to\r\nthe working clothes of his young manhood, discarding for ever the\r\nshabby-genteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline\r\nhad characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen\r\nbetter days.\r\n\r\nHe went secretly and alone, not a soul of the many who had known him\r\nbeing aware of his departure. Elizabeth-Jane accompanied him as far as\r\nthe second bridge on the highway\xe2\x80\x94for the hour of her appointment with\r\nthe unguessed visitor at Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s had not yet arrived\xe2\x80\x94and parted from\r\nhim with unfeigned wonder and sorrow, keeping him back a minute or two\r\nbefore finally letting him go. She watched his form diminish across the\r\nmoor, the yellow rush-basket at his back moving up and down with each\r\ntread, and the creases behind his knees coming and going alternately\r\ntill she could no longer see them. Though she did not know it Henchard\r\nformed at this moment much the same picture as he had presented when\r\nentering Casterbridge for the first time nearly a quarter of a century\r\nbefore; except, to be sure, that the serious addition to his years had\r\nconsiderably lessened the spring to his stride, that his state of\r\nhopelessness had weakened him, and imparted to his shoulders, as\r\nweighted by the basket, a perceptible bend.\r\n\r\nHe went on till he came to the first milestone, which stood in the\r\nbank, half way up a steep hill. He rested his basket on the top of the\r\nstone, placed his elbows on it, and gave way to a convulsive twitch,\r\nwhich was worse than a sob, because it was so hard and so dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only got her with me\xe2\x80\x94if I only had!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHard work\r\nwould be nothing to me then! But that was not to be. I\xe2\x80\x94Cain\xe2\x80\x94go alone as\r\nI deserve\xe2\x80\x94an outcast and a vagabond. But my punishment is _not_ greater\r\nthan I can bear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sternly subdued his anguish, shouldered his basket, and went on.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her\r\nequanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge. Before she had reached\r\nthe first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was\r\nevidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without\r\nceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is he gone\xe2\x80\x94and did you tell\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x94I mean of the other matter\xe2\x80\x94not of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend. Donald, who is\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, dearie; you will know soon about that. And Mr. Henchard\r\nwill hear of it if he does not go far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will go far\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or\r\nBow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to\r\nher own door. At Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s house they stopped and went in.\r\n\r\nFarfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d and Elizabeth entered. In the arm-chair\r\nsat the broad-faced genial man who had called on Henchard on a\r\nmemorable morning between one and two years before this time, and whom\r\nthe latter had seen mount the coach and depart within half-an-hour of\r\nhis arrival. It was Richard Newson. The meeting with the light-hearted\r\nfather from whom she had been separated half-a-dozen years, as if by\r\ndeath, need hardly be detailed. It was an affecting one, apart from the\r\nquestion of paternity. Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s departure was in a moment explained.\r\nWhen the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her\r\nto her old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed\r\nlikely, for Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s conduct itself was a proof that those facts were\r\ntrue. Moreover, she had grown up under Newson\xe2\x80\x99s paternal care; and even\r\nhad Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early\r\ndomiciliation might almost have carried the point against him, when the\r\nincidents of her parting with Henchard had a little worn off.\r\n\r\nNewson\xe2\x80\x99s pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could\r\nexpress. He kissed her again and again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve saved you the trouble to come and meet me\xe2\x80\x94ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that Mr. Farfrae here, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Come up and stop with me\r\nfor a day or two, Captain Newson, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring her round.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Faith,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays I, \xe2\x80\x98so I will\xe2\x80\x99; and here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Henchard is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, shutting the door. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has done\r\nit all voluntarily, and, as I gather from Elizabeth, he has been very\r\nnice with her. I was got rather uneasy; but all is as it should be, and\r\nwe will have no more deefficulties at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s very much as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson, looking into the\r\nface of each by turns. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to myself, ay, a hundred times, when I\r\ntried to get a peep at her unknown to herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Depend upon it, \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nbest that I should live on quiet for a few days like this till\r\nsomething turns up for the better.\xe2\x80\x99 I now know you are all right, and\r\nwhat can I wish for more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Captain Newson, I will be glad to see ye here every day now,\r\nsince it can do no harm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking is\r\nthat the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof, the house being\r\nlarge, and you being in lodgings by yourself\xe2\x80\x94so that a great deal of\r\ntrouble and expense would be saved ye?\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x99tis a convenience when a\r\ncouple\xe2\x80\x99s married not to hae far to go to get home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Newson; \xe2\x80\x9csince, as ye say, it can do\r\nno harm, now poor Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s gone; though I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it\r\notherwise, or put myself in his way at all; for I\xe2\x80\x99ve already in my\r\nlifetime been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness\r\ncan be expected to put up with. But what do the young woman say herself\r\nabout it? Elizabeth, my child, come and hearken to what we be talking\r\nabout, and not bide staring out o\xe2\x80\x99 the window as if ye didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDonald and you must settle it,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Elizabeth, still keeping up a\r\nscrutinizing gaze at some small object in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Newson, turning anew to Farfrae with a face\r\nexpressing thorough entry into the subject, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ll have it.\r\nAnd, Mr. Farfrae, as you provide so much, and houseroom, and all that,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do my part in the drinkables, and see to the rum and\r\nschiedam\xe2\x80\x94maybe a dozen jars will be sufficient?\xe2\x80\x94as many of the folk\r\nwill be ladies, and perhaps they won\xe2\x80\x99t drink hard enough to make a high\r\naverage in the reckoning? But you know best. I\xe2\x80\x99ve provided for men and\r\nshipmates times enough, but I\xe2\x80\x99m as ignorant as a child how many glasses\r\nof grog a woman, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a drinking woman, is expected to consume at\r\nthese ceremonies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, none\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll no want much of that\xe2\x80\x94O no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae, shaking his\r\nhead with appalled gravity. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you leave all to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone a little further in these particulars Newson,\r\nleaning back in his chair and smiling reflectively at the ceiling,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never told ye, or have I, Mr. Farfrae, how Henchard put me\r\noff the scent that time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe expressed ignorance of what the Captain alluded to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I thought I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. I resolved that I would not, I remember, not\r\nto hurt the man\xe2\x80\x99s name. But now he\xe2\x80\x99s gone I can tell ye. Why, I came to\r\nCasterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that I found\r\nye out. I had been here twice before then. The first time I passed\r\nthrough the town on my way westward, not knowing Elizabeth lived here.\r\nThen hearing at some place\xe2\x80\x94I forget where\xe2\x80\x94that a man of the name of\r\nHenchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one\r\nmorning. The old rascal!\xe2\x80\x94he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Newson. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me, I was that upset, that I\r\nwent back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward\r\nwithout lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99twas a good joke, and\r\nwell carried out, and I give the man credit for\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cA joke?\xe2\x80\x94O no!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x9cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you\r\nmight have been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe father admitted that such was the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought not to have done it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\nElizabeth sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I\r\nought to forget him now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNewson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and\r\nstrange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncrime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer\r\ntherefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious,\r\nhe began to take Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99twas not ten words that he said, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Newson pleaded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe\r\nhim? \xe2\x80\x99Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knew\r\nyour disposition\xe2\x80\x94you always were so trusting, father; I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard my\r\nmother say so hundreds of times\xe2\x80\x94and he did it to wrong you. After\r\nweaning me from you these five years by saying he was my father, he\r\nshould not have done this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they conversed; and there was nobody to set before Elizabeth any\r\nextenuation of the absent one\xe2\x80\x99s deceit. Even had he been present\r\nHenchard might scarce have pleaded it, so little did he value himself\r\nor his good name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well\xe2\x80\x94never mind\xe2\x80\x94it is all over and past,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newson\r\ngood-naturedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, about this wedding again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the man of their talk had pursued his solitary way eastward\r\ntill weariness overtook him, and he looked about for a place of rest.\r\nHis heart was so exacerbated at parting from the girl that he could not\r\nface an inn, or even a household of the most humble kind; and entering\r\na field he lay down under a wheatrick, feeling no want of food. The\r\nvery heaviness of his soul caused him to sleep profoundly.\r\n\r\nThe bright autumn sun shining into his eyes across the stubble awoke\r\nhim the next morning early. He opened his basket and ate for his\r\nbreakfast what he had packed for his supper; and in doing so overhauled\r\nthe remainder of his kit. Although everything he brought necessitated\r\ncarriage at his own back, he had secreted among his tools a few of\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s cast-off belongings, in the shape of gloves, shoes, a\r\nscrap of her handwriting, and the like, and in his pocket he carried a\r\ncurl of her hair. Having looked at these things he closed them up\r\nagain, and went onward.\r\n\r\nDuring five consecutive days Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s rush basket rode along upon his\r\nshoulder between the highway hedges, the new yellow of the rushes\r\ncatching the eye of an occasional field-labourer as he glanced through\r\nthe quickset, together with the wayfarer\xe2\x80\x99s hat and head, and\r\ndown-turned face, over which the twig shadows moved in endless\r\nprocession. It now became apparent that the direction of his journey\r\nwas Weydon Priors, which he reached on the afternoon of the sixth day.\r\n\r\nThe renowned hill whereon the annual fair had been held for so many\r\ngenerations was now bare of human beings, and almost of aught besides.\r\nA few sheep grazed thereabout, but these ran off when Henchard halted\r\nupon the summit. He deposited his basket upon the turf, and looked\r\nabout with sad curiosity; till he discovered the road by which his wife\r\nand himself had entered on the upland so memorable to both,\r\nfive-and-twenty years before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we came up that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after ascertaining his bearings.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was carrying the baby, and I was reading a ballet-sheet. Then we\r\ncrossed about here\xe2\x80\x94she so sad and weary, and I speaking to her hardly\r\nat all, because of my cursed pride and mortification at being poor.\r\nThen we saw the tent\xe2\x80\x94that must have stood more this way.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked to\r\nanother spot, it was not really where the tent had stood but it seemed\r\nso to him. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we went in, and here we sat down. I faced this way.\r\nThen I drank, and committed my crime. It must have been just on that\r\nvery pixy-ring that she was standing when she said her last words to me\r\nbefore going off with him; I can hear their sound now, and the sound of\r\nher sobs: \xe2\x80\x98O Mike! I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with thee all this while, and had nothing\r\nbut temper. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m no more to \xe2\x80\x99ee\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll try my luck elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe experienced not only the bitterness of a man who finds, in looking\r\nback upon an ambitious course, that what he has sacrificed in sentiment\r\nwas worth as much as what he has gained in substance; but the\r\nsuperadded bitterness of seeing his very recantation nullified. He had\r\nbeen sorry for all this long ago; but his attempts to replace ambition\r\nby love had been as fully foiled as his ambition itself. His wronged\r\nwife had foiled them by a fraud so grandly simple as to be almost a\r\nvirtue. It was an odd sequence that out of all this tampering with\r\nsocial law came that flower of Nature, Elizabeth. Part of his wish to\r\nwash his hands of life arose from his perception of its contrarious\r\ninconsistencies\xe2\x80\x94of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s jaunty readiness to support unorthodox\r\nsocial principles.\r\n\r\nHe intended to go on from this place\xe2\x80\x94visited as an act of penance\xe2\x80\x94into\r\nanother part of the country altogether. But he could not help thinking\r\nof Elizabeth, and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived. Out of\r\nthis it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of\r\nthe world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for\r\nhis stepdaughter. As a consequence, instead of following a straight\r\ncourse yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost\r\nunconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention;\r\ntill, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman,\r\nbecame part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In\r\nascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as\r\nhe could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind\r\nthe exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay.\r\nSneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour\xe2\x80\x94nay, every few\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x94conjectured her actions for the time being\xe2\x80\x94her sitting down and\r\nrising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nFarfrae\xe2\x80\x99s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool,\r\nand efface her image. And then he would say to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cO you fool!\r\nAll this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay-trusser,\r\nwork of that sort being in demand at this autumn time. The scene of his\r\nhiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course\r\nwas the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy\r\ncentres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs. He had chosen the\r\nneighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though\r\nat a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose\r\nwelfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he\r\nhad occupied a quarter of a century before. Externally there was\r\nnothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and by\r\nhis new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half-formed\r\nstate had been able to accomplish. But the ingenious machinery\r\ncontrived by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration\r\nto a minimum\xe2\x80\x94which arranges that wisdom to do shall come _pari passu_\r\nwith the departure of zest for doing\xe2\x80\x94stood in the way of all that. He\r\nhad no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a\r\nmere painted scene to him.\r\n\r\nVery often, as his hay-knife crunched down among the sweet-smelling\r\ngrassy stems, he would survey mankind and say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cHere and\r\neverywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves, though\r\nwanted by their families, the country, and the world; while I, an\r\noutcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and despised by\r\nall, live on against my will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed\r\nalong the road\xe2\x80\x94not from a general curiosity by any means\xe2\x80\x94but in the\r\nhope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London some\r\nwould, sooner or later, speak of the former place. The distance,\r\nhowever, was too great to lend much probability to his desire; and the\r\nhighest result of his attention to wayside words was that he did indeed\r\nhear the name \xe2\x80\x9cCasterbridge\xe2\x80\x9d uttered one day by the driver of a\r\nroad-waggon. Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in, and\r\nhailed the speaker, who was a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve come from there, maister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in answer to Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cI trade up and down, ye know; though, what with this\r\ntravelling without horses that\xe2\x80\x99s getting so common, my work will soon\r\nbe done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything moving in the old place, mid I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting\r\nmarried. Now is that true or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say for the life o\xe2\x80\x99 me. O no, I should think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yes, John\xe2\x80\x94you forget,\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman inside the waggon-tilt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nwere them packages we carr\xe2\x80\x99d there at the beginning o\xe2\x80\x99 the week? Surely\r\nthey said a wedding was coming off soon\xe2\x80\x94on Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on\r\njangling over the hill.\r\n\r\nHenchard was convinced that the woman\xe2\x80\x99s memory served her well. The\r\ndate was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on\r\neither side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth;\r\nbut his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet\r\nbefore he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her\r\nwedding was not as she wished it to be.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not\r\nElizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own\r\nhaughty sense that his presence was no longer desired. He had assumed\r\nthe return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to\r\nreturn; still less that Elizabeth-Jane would welcome him; and with no\r\nproof whatever that if he did return he would stay. What if he had been\r\nmistaken in his views; if there had been no necessity that his own\r\nabsolute separation from her he loved should be involved in these\r\nuntoward incidents? To make one more attempt to be near her: to go\r\nback, to see her, to plead his cause before her, to ask forgiveness for\r\nhis fraud, to endeavour strenuously to hold his own in her love; it was\r\nworth the risk of repulse, ay, of life itself.\r\n\r\nBut how to initiate this reversal of all his former resolves without\r\ncausing husband and wife to despise him for his inconsistency was a\r\nquestion which made him tremble and brood.\r\n\r\nHe cut and cut his trusses two days more, and then he concluded his\r\nhesitancies by a sudden reckless determination to go to the wedding\r\nfestivity. Neither writing nor message would be expected of him. She\r\nhad regretted his decision to be absent\xe2\x80\x94his unanticipated presence\r\nwould fill the little unsatisfied corner that would probably have place\r\nin her just heart without him.\r\n\r\nTo intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event\r\nwith which that personality could show nothing in keeping, he decided\r\nnot to make his appearance till evening\xe2\x80\x94when stiffness would have worn\r\noff, and a gentle wish to let bygones be bygones would exercise its\r\nsway in all hearts.\r\n\r\nHe started on foot, two mornings before St. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s-tide, allowing\r\nhimself about sixteen miles to perform for each of the three days\xe2\x80\x99\r\njourney, reckoning the wedding-day as one. There were only two towns,\r\nMelchester and Shottsford, of any importance along his course, and at\r\nthe latter he stopped on the second night, not only to rest, but to\r\nprepare himself for the next evening.\r\n\r\nPossessing no clothes but the working suit he stood in\xe2\x80\x94now stained and\r\ndistorted by their two months of hard usage, he entered a shop to make\r\nsome purchases which should put him, externally at any rate, a little\r\nin harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow. A rough yet\r\nrespectable coat and hat, a new shirt and neck-cloth, were the chief of\r\nthese; and having satisfied himself that in appearance at least he\r\nwould not now offend her, he proceeded to the more interesting\r\nparticular of buying her some present.\r\n\r\nWhat should that present be? He walked up and down the street,\r\nregarding dubiously the display in the shop windows, from a gloomy\r\nsense that what he might most like to give her would be beyond his\r\nmiserable pocket. At length a caged goldfinch met his eye. The cage was\r\na plain and small one, the shop humble, and on inquiry he concluded he\r\ncould afford the modest sum asked. A sheet of newspaper was tied round\r\nthe little creature\xe2\x80\x99s wire prison, and with the wrapped up cage in his\r\nhand Henchard sought a lodging for the night.\r\n\r\nNext day he set out upon the last stage, and was soon within the\r\ndistrict which had been his dealing ground in bygone years. Part of the\r\ndistance he travelled by carrier, seating himself in the darkest corner\r\nat the back of that trader\xe2\x80\x99s van; and as the other passengers, mainly\r\nwomen going short journeys, mounted and alighted in front of Henchard,\r\nthey talked over much local news, not the least portion of this being\r\nthe wedding then in course of celebration at the town they were\r\nnearing. It appeared from their accounts that the town band had been\r\nhired for the evening party, and, lest the convivial instincts of that\r\nbody should get the better of their skill, the further step had been\r\ntaken of engaging the string band from Budmouth, so that there would be\r\na reserve of harmony to fall back upon in case of need.\r\n\r\nHe heard, however, but few particulars beyond those known to him\r\nalready, the incident of the deepest interest on the journey being the\r\nsoft pealing of the Casterbridge bells, which reached the travellers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nears while the van paused on the top of Yalbury Hill to have the drag\r\nlowered. The time was just after twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nThose notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been\r\nno slip \xe2\x80\x99twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald\r\nFarfrae were man and wife.\r\n\r\nHenchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering\r\ncompanions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and\r\nin pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street\r\ntill evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted\r\nhere, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely\r\nfigure on the broad white highway.\r\n\r\nIt was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two\r\nyears earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta.\r\nThe place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but\r\nFarfrae had another wife\xe2\x80\x94and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only\r\nhoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers\r\nat the former time.\r\n\r\nHe passed the remainder of the afternoon in a curious highstrung\r\ncondition, unable to do much but think of the approaching meeting with\r\nher, and sadly satirize himself for his emotions thereon, as a Samson\r\nshorn. Such an innovation on Casterbridge customs as a flitting of\r\nbridegroom and bride from the town immediately after the ceremony, was\r\nnot likely, but if it should have taken place he would wait till their\r\nreturn. To assure himself on this point he asked a market-man when near\r\nthe borough if the newly-married couple had gone away, and was promptly\r\ninformed that they had not; they were at that hour, according to all\r\naccounts, entertaining a houseful of guests at their home in Corn\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nHenchard dusted his boots, washed his hands at the riverside, and\r\nproceeded up the town under the feeble lamps. He need have made no\r\ninquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s residence it was\r\nplain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within, and that\r\nDonald himself shared it, his voice being distinctly audible in the\r\nstreet, giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country\r\nthat he loved so well as never to have revisited it. Idlers were\r\nstanding on the pavement in front; and wishing to escape the notice of\r\nthese Henchard passed quickly on to the door.\r\n\r\nIt was wide open, the hall was lighted extravagantly, and people were\r\ngoing up and down the stairs. His courage failed him; to enter\r\nfootsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency\r\nwas to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court\r\nrepulse from her husband. Accordingly he went round into the street at\r\nthe back that he knew so well, entered the garden, and came quietly\r\ninto the house through the kitchen, temporarily depositing the bird and\r\ncage under a bush outside, to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival.\r\n\r\nSolitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard that he now feared\r\ncircumstances he would formerly have scorned, and he began to wish that\r\nhe had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture. However,\r\nhis progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the\r\nkitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional\r\nhousekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s establishment\r\nwas just then suffering. She was one of those people whom nothing\r\nsurprises, and though to her, a total stranger, his request must have\r\nseemed odd, she willingly volunteered to go up and inform the master\r\nand mistress of the house that \xe2\x80\x9ca humble old friend\xe2\x80\x9d had come.\r\n\r\nOn second thought she said that he had better not wait in the kitchen,\r\nbut come up into the little back-parlour, which was empty. He thereupon\r\nfollowed her thither, and she left him. Just as she got across the\r\nlanding to the door of the best parlour a dance was struck up, and she\r\nreturned to say that she would wait till that was over before\r\nannouncing him\xe2\x80\x94Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae having both joined in the figure.\r\n\r\nThe door of the front room had been taken off its hinges to give more\r\nspace, and that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar, he could see\r\nfractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them\r\nnear the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and\r\nstreaming curls of hair; together with about three-fifths of the band\r\nin profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s elbow, and the\r\ntip of the bass-viol bow.\r\n\r\nThe gaiety jarred upon Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s spirits; and he could not quite\r\nunderstand why Farfrae, a much-sobered man, and a widower, who had had\r\nhis trials, should have cared for it all, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nhe was quite a young man still, and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by\r\ndance and song. That the quiet Elizabeth, who had long ago appraised\r\nlife at a moderate value, and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that\r\nmarriage was as a rule no dancing matter, should have had zest for this\r\nrevelry surprised him still more. However, young people could not be\r\nquite old people, he concluded, and custom was omnipotent.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of the dance the performers spread out somewhat, and\r\nthen for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised\r\ndaughter who had mastered him, and made his heart ache. She was in a\r\ndress of white silk or satin, he was not near enough to say which\xe2\x80\x94snowy\r\nwhite, without a tinge of milk or cream; and the expression of her face\r\nwas one of nervous pleasure rather than of gaiety. Presently Farfrae\r\ncame round, his exuberant Scotch movement making him conspicuous in a\r\nmoment. The pair were not dancing together, but Henchard could discern\r\nthat whenever the chances of the figure made them the partners of a\r\nmoment their emotions breathed a much subtler essence than at other\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nBy degrees Henchard became aware that the measure was trod by some one\r\nwho out-Farfraed Farfrae in saltatory intenseness. This was strange,\r\nand it was stranger to find that the eclipsing personage was\r\nElizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x99s partner. The first time that Henchard saw him he was\r\nsweeping grandly round, his head quivering and low down, his legs in\r\nthe form of an X and his back towards the door. The next time he came\r\nround in the other direction, his white waist-coat preceding his face,\r\nand his toes preceding his white waistcoat. That happy face\xe2\x80\x94Henchard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplete discomfiture lay in it. It was Newson\xe2\x80\x99s, who had indeed come\r\nand supplanted him.\r\n\r\nHenchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other\r\nmovement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His\r\nagitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he\r\ncould leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed\r\nElizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the\r\nroom immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Henchard!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, starting back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Elizabeth?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, as he seized her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x94_Mr._ Henchard? Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t scourge me like that! Call me\r\nworthless old Henchard\xe2\x80\x94anything\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x99ee be so cold as this! O my\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x94I see you have another\xe2\x80\x94a real father in my place. Then you know\r\nall; but don\xe2\x80\x99t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room\r\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed up, and gently drew her hand away. \xe2\x80\x9cI could have loved you\r\nalways\xe2\x80\x94I would have, gladly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I when I know you\r\nhave deceived me so\xe2\x80\x94so bitterly deceived me! You persuaded me that my\r\nfather was not my father\xe2\x80\x94allowed me to live on in ignorance of the\r\ntruth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to\r\nfind me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death,\r\nwhich nearly broke his heart. O how can I love as I once did a man who\r\nhas served us like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s lips half parted to begin an explanation. But he shut them\r\nup like a vice, and uttered not a sound. How should he, there and then,\r\nset before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nhe had himself been deceived in her identity at first, till informed by\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s letter that his own child had died; that, in the second\r\naccusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who\r\nloved her affection better than his own honour? Among the many\r\nhindrances to such a pleading not the least was this, that he did not\r\nsufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal\r\nor elaborate argument.\r\n\r\nWaiving, therefore, his privilege of self-defence, he regarded only his\r\ndiscomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye distress yourself on my account,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with\r\nproud superiority. \xe2\x80\x9cI would not wish it\xe2\x80\x94at such a time, too, as this. I\r\nhave done wrong in coming to \xe2\x80\x99ee\xe2\x80\x94I see my error. But it is only for\r\nonce, so forgive it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never trouble \xe2\x80\x99ee again, Elizabeth-Jane\xe2\x80\x94no,\r\nnot to my dying day! Good-night. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, before she could collect her thoughts, Henchard went out from her\r\nrooms, and departed from the house by the back way as he had come; and\r\nshe saw him no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV.\r\n\r\nIt was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter.\r\nElizabeth-Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation,\r\nand the only difference between Donald\xe2\x80\x99s movements now and formerly was\r\nthat he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than\r\nhe had been in the habit of doing for some time.\r\n\r\nNewson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party\r\n(whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather\r\nthan of the married couple\xe2\x80\x99s), and was stared at and honoured as became\r\nthe returned Crusoe of the hour. But whether or not because\r\nCasterbridge was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and\r\ndisappearances through having been for centuries an assize town, in\r\nwhich sensational exits from the world, antipodean absences, and such\r\nlike, were half-yearly occurrences, the inhabitants did not altogether\r\nlose their equanimity on his account. On the fourth morning he was\r\ndiscovered disconsolately climbing a hill, in his craving to get a\r\nglimpse of the sea from somewhere or other. The contiguity of salt\r\nwater proved to be such a necessity of his existence that he preferred\r\nBudmouth as a place of residence, notwithstanding the society of his\r\ndaughter in the other town. Thither he went, and settled in lodgings in\r\na green-shuttered cottage which had a bow-window, jutting out\r\nsufficiently to afford glimpses of a vertical strip of blue sea to any\r\none opening the sash, and leaning forward far enough to look through a\r\nnarrow lane of tall intervening houses.\r\n\r\nElizabeth-Jane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour,\r\ncritically surveying some re-arrangement of articles with her head to\r\none side, when the housemaid came in with the announcement, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, please\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, we know now how that bird-cage came there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn exploring her new domain during the first week of residence, gazing\r\nwith critical satisfaction on this cheerful room and that, penetrating\r\ncautiously into dark cellars, sallying forth with gingerly tread to the\r\ngarden, now leaf-strewn by autumn winds, and thus, like a wise\r\nfield-marshal, estimating the capabilities of the site whereon she was\r\nabout to open her housekeeping campaign\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Donald Farfrae had\r\ndiscovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper,\r\nand at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\xe2\x80\x94the dead body\r\nof a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come\r\nthere, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death\r\nwas evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her.\r\nShe had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s tender\r\nbanter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please ma\xe2\x80\x99am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nman who called on the evening of the wedding\xe2\x80\x94he was seen wi\xe2\x80\x99 it in his\r\nhand as he came up the street; and \xe2\x80\x99tis thoughted that he put it down\r\nwhile he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where\r\nhe had left it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized\r\nhold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been\r\nbrought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance.\r\nHe had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done\r\nin the past; but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing, and\r\nlive on as one of his own worst accusers. She went out, looked at the\r\ncage, buried the starved little singer, and from that hour her heart\r\nsoftened towards the self-alienated man.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband came in she told him her solution of the bird-cage\r\nmystery; and begged Donald to help her in finding out, as soon as\r\npossible, whither Henchard had banished himself, that she might make\r\nher peace with him; try to do something to render his life less that of\r\nan outcast, and more tolerable to him. Although Farfrae had never so\r\npassionately liked Henchard as Henchard had liked him, he had, on the\r\nother hand, never so passionately hated in the same direction as his\r\nformer friend had done, and he was therefore not the least indisposed\r\nto assist Elizabeth-Jane in her laudable plan.\r\n\r\nBut it was by no means easy to set about discovering Henchard. He had\r\napparently sunk into the earth on leaving Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\nElizabeth-Jane remembered what he had once attempted; and trembled.\r\n\r\nBut though she did not know it Henchard had become a changed man since\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94as far, that is, as change of emotional basis can justify such a\r\nradical phrase; and she needed not to fear. In a few days Farfrae\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiries elicited that Henchard had been seen by one who knew him\r\nwalking steadily along the Melchester highway eastward, at twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at night\xe2\x80\x94in other words, retracing his steps on the road by\r\nwhich he had come.\r\n\r\nThis was enough; and the next morning Farfrae might have been\r\ndiscovered driving his gig out of Casterbridge in that direction,\r\nElizabeth-Jane sitting beside him, wrapped in a thick flat fur\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nvictorine of the period\xe2\x80\x94her complexion somewhat richer than formerly,\r\nand an incipient matronly dignity, which the serene Minerva-eyes of one\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhose gestures beamed with mind\xe2\x80\x9d made becoming, settling on her face.\r\nHaving herself arrived at a promising haven from at least the grosser\r\ntroubles of her life, her object was to place Henchard in some similar\r\nquietude before he should sink into that lower stage of existence which\r\nwas only too possible to him now.\r\n\r\nAfter driving along the highway for a few miles they made further\r\ninquiries, and learnt of a road-mender, who had been working\r\nthereabouts for weeks, that he had observed such a man at the time\r\nmentioned; he had left the Melchester coachroad at Weatherbury by a\r\nforking highway which skirted the north of Egdon Heath. Into this road\r\nthey directed the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head, and soon were bowling across that\r\nancient country whose surface never had been stirred to a finger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndepth, save by the scratchings of rabbits, since brushed by the feet of\r\nthe earliest tribes. The tumuli these had left behind, dun and shagged\r\nwith heather, jutted roundly into the sky from the uplands, as though\r\nthey were the full breasts of Diana Multimammia supinely extended\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThey searched Egdon, but found no Henchard. Farfrae drove onward, and\r\nby the afternoon reached the neighbourhood of some extension of the\r\nheath to the north of Anglebury, a prominent feature of which, in the\r\nform of a blasted clump of firs on a summit of a hill, they soon passed\r\nunder. That the road they were following had, up to this point, been\r\nHenchard\xe2\x80\x99s track on foot they were pretty certain; but the\r\nramifications which now began to reveal themselves in the route made\r\nfurther progress in the right direction a matter of pure guess-work,\r\nand Donald strongly advised his wife to give up the search in person,\r\nand trust to other means for obtaining news of her stepfather. They\r\nwere now a score of miles at least from home, but, by resting the horse\r\nfor a couple of hours at a village they had just traversed, it would be\r\npossible to get back to Casterbridge that same day, while to go much\r\nfurther afield would reduce them to the necessity of camping out for\r\nthe night, \xe2\x80\x9cand that will make a hole in a sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\nShe pondered the position, and agreed with him.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly drew rein, but before reversing their direction paused a\r\nmoment and looked vaguely round upon the wide country which the\r\nelevated position disclosed. While they looked a solitary human form\r\ncame from under the clump of trees, and crossed ahead of them. The\r\nperson was some labourer; his gait was shambling, his regard fixed in\r\nfront of him as absolutely as if he wore blinkers; and in his hand he\r\ncarried a few sticks. Having crossed the road he descended into a\r\nravine, where a cottage revealed itself, which he entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were not so far away from Casterbridge I should say that must be\r\npoor Whittle. \xe2\x80\x99Tis just like him,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it may be Whittle, for he\xe2\x80\x99s never been to the yard these three\r\nweeks, going away without saying any word at all; and I owing him for\r\ntwo days\xe2\x80\x99 work, without knowing who to pay it to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe possibility led them to alight, and at least make an inquiry at the\r\ncottage. Farfrae hitched the reins to the gate-post, and they\r\napproached what was of humble dwellings surely the humblest. The walls,\r\nbuilt of kneaded clay originally faced with a trowel, had been worn by\r\nyears of rain-washings to a lumpy crumbling surface, channelled and\r\nsunken from its plane, its gray rents held together here and there by a\r\nleafy strap of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the\r\npurpose. The rafters were sunken, and the thatch of the roof in ragged\r\nholes. Leaves from the fence had been blown into the corners of the\r\ndoorway, and lay there undisturbed. The door was ajar; Farfrae knocked;\r\nand he who stood before them was Whittle, as they had conjectured.\r\n\r\nHis face showed marks of deep sadness, his eyes lighting on them with\r\nan unfocused gaze; and he still held in his hand the few sticks he had\r\nbeen out to gather. As soon as he recognized them he started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Abel Whittle; is it that ye are heere?\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, yes sir! You see he was kind-like to mother when she wer here\r\nbelow, though \xe2\x80\x99a was rough to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you talking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO sir\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Henchet! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye know it? He\xe2\x80\x99s just gone\xe2\x80\x94about\r\nhalf-an-hour ago, by the sun; for I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no watch to my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot\xe2\x80\x94dead?\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Elizabeth-Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone! He was kind-like to mother when she wer here\r\nbelow, sending her the best ship-coal, and hardly any ashes from it at\r\nall; and taties, and such-like that were very needful to her. I seed en\r\ngo down street on the night of your worshipful\xe2\x80\x99s wedding to the lady at\r\nyer side, and I thought he looked low and faltering. And I followed en\r\nover Grey\xe2\x80\x99s Bridge, and he turned and zeed me, and said, \xe2\x80\x98You go back!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut I followed, and he turned again, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Do you hear, sir? Go\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x99 But I zeed that he was low, and I followed on still. Then \xe2\x80\x99a\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Whittle, what do ye follow me for when I\xe2\x80\x99ve told ye to go back\r\nall these times?\xe2\x80\x99 And I said, \xe2\x80\x98Because, sir, I see things be bad with\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee, and ye wer kind-like to mother if ye wer rough to me, and I would\r\nfain be kind-like to you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he walked on, and I followed; and he\r\nnever complained at me no more. We walked on like that all night; and\r\nin the blue o\xe2\x80\x99 the morning, when \xe2\x80\x99twas hardly day, I looked ahead o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme, and I zeed that he wambled, and could hardly drag along. By the\r\ntime we had got past here, but I had seen that this house was empty as\r\nI went by, and I got him to come back; and I took down the boards from\r\nthe windows, and helped him inside. \xe2\x80\x98What, Whittle,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and can\r\nye really be such a poor fond fool as to care for such a wretch as I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen I went on further, and some neighbourly woodmen lent me a bed, and\r\na chair, and a few other traps, and we brought \xe2\x80\x99em here, and made him\r\nas comfortable as we could. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t gain strength, for you see,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat\xe2\x80\x94no appetite at all\xe2\x80\x94and he got weaker; and to-day\r\nhe died. One of the neighbours have gone to get a man to measure him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me\xe2\x80\x94is that so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farfrae.\r\n\r\nAs for Elizabeth, she said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing\r\nupon it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Abel Whittle. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not being a man o\xe2\x80\x99 letters, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t read writing; so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is. I can get it and show\r\nye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a\r\nmoment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as\r\nfollows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMICHAEL HENCHARD\xe2\x80\x99S WILL.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve\r\non account of me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c& that I be not bury\xe2\x80\x99d in consecrated ground.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c& that no flours be planted on my grave.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c& that no man remember me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo this I put my name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her.\r\n\r\nShe could not answer distinctly. \xe2\x80\x9cO Donald!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried at last through\r\nher tears, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so\r\nmuch if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!... But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no altering\xe2\x80\x94so it must be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as\r\nfar as practicable by Elizabeth-Jane, though less from a sense of the\r\nsacredness of last words, as such, than from her independent knowledge\r\nthat the man who wrote them meant what he said. She knew the directions\r\nto be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of, and\r\nhence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure,\r\nor her husband credit for large-heartedness.\r\n\r\nAll was over at last, even her regrets for having misunderstood him on\r\nhis last visit, for not having searched him out sooner, though these\r\nwere deep and sharp for a good while. From this time forward\r\nElizabeth-Jane found herself in a latitude of calm weather, kindly and\r\ngrateful in itself, and doubly so after the Capharnaum in which some of\r\nher preceding years had been spent. As the lively and sparkling\r\nemotions of her early married life cohered into an equable serenity,\r\nthe finer movements of her nature found scope in discovering to the\r\nnarrow-lived ones around her the secret (as she had once learnt it) of\r\nmaking limited opportunities endurable; which she deemed to consist in\r\nthe cunning enlargement, by a species of microscopic treatment, of\r\nthose minute forms of satisfaction that offer themselves to everybody\r\nnot in positive pain; which, thus handled, have much of the same\r\ninspiring effect upon life as wider interests cursorily embraced.\r\n\r\nHer teaching had a reflex action upon herself, insomuch that she\r\nthought she could perceive no great personal difference between being\r\nrespected in the nether parts of Casterbridge and glorified at the\r\nuppermost end of the social world. Her position was, indeed, to a\r\nmarked degree one that, in the common phrase, afforded much to be\r\nthankful for. That she was not demonstratively thankful was no fault of\r\nhers. Her experience had been of a kind to teach her, rightly or\r\nwrongly, that the doubtful honour of a brief transit through a sorry\r\nworld hardly called for effusiveness, even when the path was suddenly\r\nirradiated at some half-way point by daybeams rich as hers. But her\r\nstrong sense that neither she nor any human being deserved less than\r\nwas given, did not blind her to the fact that there were others\r\nreceiving less who had deserved much more. And in being forced to class\r\nherself among the fortunate she did not cease to wonder at the\r\npersistence of the unforeseen, when the one to whom such unbroken\r\ntranquility had been accorded in the adult stage was she whose youth\r\nhad seemed to teach that happiness was but the occasional episode in a\r\ngeneral drama of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 143-0.txt or 143-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/143/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
