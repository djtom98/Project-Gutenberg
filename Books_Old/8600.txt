Then,\r\nshivering from having remained in a thin loose jacket, exposed to the\r\nfresh air at the window, she had thrown herself across the bed, drowsy,\r\nfeverish, and her cheeks bathed in tears.\r\n\r\nFor a week past, on leaving the \xe2\x80\x9cTwo-Headed Calf,\xe2\x80\x9d where they took\r\ntheir meals, he had sent her home with the children and never\r\nreappeared himself till late at night, alleging that he had been in\r\nsearch of work. That evening, while watching for his return, she\r\nthought she had seen him enter the dancing-hall of the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand-Balcony,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe ten blazing windows of which lighted up with the glare of a\r\nconflagration the dark expanse of the exterior Boulevards; and five or\r\nsix paces behind him, she had caught sight of little Adele, a\r\nburnisher, who dined at the same restaurant, swinging her hands, as if\r\nshe had just quitted his arm so as not to pass together under the\r\ndazzling light of the globes at the door.\r\n\r\nWhen, towards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Gervaise awoke, stiff and sore, she broke\r\nforth into sobs. Lantier had not returned. For the first time he had\r\nslept away from home. She remained seated on the edge of the bed, under\r\nthe strip of faded chintz, which hung from the rod fastened to the\r\nceiling by a piece of string. And slowly, with her eyes veiled by\r\ntears, she glanced round the wretched lodging, furnished with a walnut\r\nchest of drawers, minus one drawer, three rush-bottomed chairs, and a\r\nlittle greasy table, on which stood a broken water-jug. There had been\r\nadded, for the children, an iron bedstead, which prevented any one\r\ngetting to the chest of drawers, and filled two-thirds of the room.\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s and Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s trunk, wide open, in one corner, displayed its\r\nemptiness, and a man\xe2\x80\x99s old hat right at the bottom almost buried\r\nbeneath some dirty shirts and socks; whilst, against the walls, above\r\nthe articles of furniture, hung a shawl full of holes, and a pair of\r\ntrousers begrimed with mud, the last rags which the dealers in\r\nsecond-hand clothes declined to buy. In the centre of the mantel-piece,\r\nlying between two odd zinc candle-sticks, was a bundle of pink\r\npawn-tickets. It was the best room of the hotel, the first floor room,\r\nlooking on to the Boulevard.\r\n\r\nThe two children were sleeping side by side, with their heads on the\r\nsame pillow. Claude, aged eight years, was breathing quietly, with his\r\nlittle hands thrown outside the coverlet; while Etienne, only four\r\nyears old, was smiling, with one arm round his brother\xe2\x80\x99s neck. And\r\nbare-footed, without thinking to again put on the old shoes that had\r\nfallen on the floor, she resumed her position at the window, her eyes\r\nsearching the pavements in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe hotel was situated on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, to the left of\r\nthe Barriere Poissonniere. It was a building of two stories high,\r\npainted a red, of the color of wine dregs, up to the second floor, and\r\nwith shutters all rotted by the rain. Over a lamp with starred panes of\r\nglass, one could manage to read, between the two windows, the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHotel Boncoeur, kept by Marsoullier,\xe2\x80\x9d painted in big yellow letters,\r\nseveral pieces of which the moldering of the plaster had carried away.\r\nThe lamp preventing her seeing, Gervaise raised herself on tiptoe,\r\nstill holding the handkerchief to her lips. She looked to the right,\r\ntowards the Boulevard Rochechouart, where groups of butchers, in aprons\r\nsmeared with blood, were hanging about in front of the\r\nslaughter-houses; and the fresh breeze wafted occasionally a stench of\r\nslaughtered beasts. Looking to the left, she scanned a long avenue that\r\nended nearly in front of her, where the white mass of the Lariboisiere\r\nHospital was then in course of construction. Slowly, from one end of\r\nthe horizon to the other, she followed the octroi wall, behind which\r\nshe sometimes heard, during night time, the shrieks of persons being\r\nmurdered; and she searchingly looked into the remote angles, the dark\r\ncorners, black with humidity and filth, fearing to discern there\r\nLantier\xe2\x80\x99s body, stabbed to death.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the endless gray wall that surrounded the city with its\r\nbelt of desolation. When she raised her eyes higher, she became aware\r\nof a bright burst of sunlight. The dull hum of the city\xe2\x80\x99s awakening\r\nalready filled the air. Craning her neck to look at the Poissonniere\r\ngate, she remained for a time watching the constant stream of men,\r\nhorses, and carts which flooded down from the heights of Montmartre and\r\nLa Chapelle, pouring between the two squat octroi lodges. It was like a\r\nherd of plodding cattle, an endless throng widened by sudden stoppages\r\ninto eddies that spilled off the sidewalks into the street, a steady\r\nprocession of laborers on their way back to work with tools slung over\r\ntheir back and a loaf of bread under their arm. This human inundation\r\nkept pouring down into Paris to be constantly swallowed up. Gervaise\r\nleaned further out at the risk of falling when she thought she\r\nrecognized Lantier among the throng. She pressed the handkerchief\r\ntighter against her mouth, as though to push back the pain within her.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a young and cheerful voice caused her to leave the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the old man isn\xe2\x80\x99t here, Madame Lantier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no, Monsieur Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, trying to smile.\r\n\r\nCoupeau, a zinc-worker who occupied a ten franc room on the top floor,\r\nhaving seen the door unlocked, had walked in as friends will do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m now working over there in the hospital.\r\nWhat beautiful May weather, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? The air is rather sharp this\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he looked at Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s face, red with weeping. When he saw that\r\nthe bed had not been slept in, he shook his head gently; then he went\r\nto the children\xe2\x80\x99s couch where they were sleeping, looking as rosy as\r\ncherubs, and, lowering his voice, he said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, the old man\xe2\x80\x99s not been home, has he? Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry yourself,\r\nMadame Lantier. He\xe2\x80\x99s very much occupied with politics. When they were\r\nvoting for Eugene Sue the other day, he was acting almost crazy. He has\r\nvery likely spent the night with some friends blackguarding crapulous\r\nBonaparte.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured with an effort. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think that. I know\r\nwhere Lantier is. You see, we have our little troubles like the rest of\r\nthe world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau winked his eye, to indicate he was not a dupe of this\r\nfalsehood; and he went off, after offering to fetch her milk, if she\r\ndid not care to go out: she was a good and courageous woman, and might\r\ncount upon him on any day of trouble.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was gone, Gervaise again returned to the window. At the\r\nBarriere, the tramp of the drove still continued in the morning air:\r\nlocksmiths in short blue blouses, masons in white jackets, house\r\npainters in overcoats over long smocks. From a distance the crowd\r\nlooked like a chalky smear of neutral hue composed chiefly of faded\r\nblue and dingy gray. When one of the workers occasionally stopped to\r\nlight his pipe the others kept plodding past him, without sparing a\r\nlaugh or a word to a comrade. With cheeks gray as clay, their eyes were\r\ncontinually drawn toward Paris which was swallowing them one by one.\r\n\r\nAt both corners of the Rue des Poissonniers however, some of the men\r\nslackened their pace as they neared the doors of the two wine-dealers\r\nwho were taking down their shutters; and, before entering, they stood\r\non the edge of the pavement, looking sideways over Paris, with no\r\nstrength in their arms and already inclined for a day of idleness.\r\nInside various groups were already buying rounds of drinks, or just\r\nstanding around, forgetting their troubles, crowding up the place,\r\ncoughing, spitting, clearing their throats with sip after sip.\r\n\r\nGervaise was watching Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s wineshop to the left of the\r\nstreet, where she thought she had seen Lantier, when a stout woman,\r\nbareheaded and wearing an apron called to her from the middle of the\r\nroadway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Madame Lantier, you\xe2\x80\x99re up very early!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise leaned out. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy! It\xe2\x80\x99s you, Madame Boche! Oh! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot\r\nof work to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, things don\xe2\x80\x99t do themselves, do they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued between roadway and window. Madame Boche was\r\nconcierge of the building where the \xe2\x80\x9cTwo-Headed Calf\xe2\x80\x9d was on the ground\r\nfloor. Gervaise had waited for Lantier more than once in the\r\nconcierge\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, so as not to be alone at table with all the men who\r\nate at the restaurant. Madame Boche was going to a tailor who was late\r\nin mending an overcoat for her husband. She mentioned one of her\r\ntenants who had come in with a woman the night before and kept\r\neverybody awake past three in the morning. She looked at Gervaise with\r\nintense curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Monsieur Lantier, then, still in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gervaise, who could not avoid blushing.\r\n\r\nMadame Boche saw the tears come into her eyes; and, satisfied no doubt,\r\nshe turned to go, declaring men to be a cursed, lazy set. As she went\r\noff, she called back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this morning you go to the wash-house, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99ve something\r\nto wash, too. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you a place next to me, and we can chat\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as if moved with sudden pity, she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little thing, you had far better not remain there; you\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nharm. You look quite blue with cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise still obstinately remained at the window during two mortal\r\nhours, till eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Now all the shops had opened. Only a few\r\nwork men were still hurrying along.\r\n\r\nThe working girls now filled the boulevard: metal polishers, milliners,\r\nflower sellers, shivering in their thin clothing. In small groups they\r\nchattered gaily, laughing and glancing here and there. Occasionally\r\nthere would be one girl by herself, thin, pale, serious-faced, picking\r\nher way along the city wall among the puddles and the filth.\r\n\r\nAfter the working girls, the office clerks came past, breathing upon\r\ntheir chilled fingers and munching penny rolls. Some of them are gaunt\r\nyoung fellows in ill-fitting suits, their tired eyes still fogged from\r\nsleep. Others are older men, stooped and tottering, with faces pale and\r\ndrawn from long hours of office work and glancing nervously at their\r\nwatches for fear of arriving late.\r\n\r\nIn time the Boulevards settle into their usual morning quiet. Old folks\r\ncome out to stroll in the sun. Tired young mothers in bedraggled skirts\r\ncuddle babies in their arms or sit on a bench to change diapers.\r\nChildren run, squealing and laughing, pushing and shoving.\r\n\r\nThen Gervaise felt herself choking, dizzy with anguish, all hopes gone;\r\nit seemed to her that everything was ended, even time itself, and that\r\nLantier would return no more. Her eyes vacantly wandered from the old\r\nslaughter-house, foul with butchery and with stench, to the new white\r\nhospital which, through the yawning openings of its ranges of windows,\r\ndisclosed the naked wards, where death was preparing to mow. In front\r\nof her on the other side of the octroi wall the bright heavens dazzled\r\nher, with the rising sun which rose higher and higher over the vast\r\nawaking city.\r\n\r\nThe young woman was seated on a chair, no longer crying, and with her\r\nhands abandoned on her lap, when Lantier quietly entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you! It\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, rising to throw herself upon his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s me. What of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going to begin any\r\nof your nonsense, I hope!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had pushed her aside. Then, with a gesture of ill-humor he threw his\r\nblack felt hat to the chest of drawers. He was a young fellow of\r\ntwenty-six years of age, short and very dark, with a handsome figure,\r\nand slight moustaches which his hand was always mechanically twirling.\r\nHe wore a workman\xe2\x80\x99s overalls and an old soiled overcoat, which he had\r\nbelted tightly at the waist, and he spoke with a strong Provencal\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nGervaise, who had fallen back on her chair, gently complained, in short\r\nsentences: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not had a wink of sleep. I feared some harm had\r\nhappened to you. Where have you been? Where did you spend the night?\r\nFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it again, or I shall go crazy. Tell me\r\nAuguste, where have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I had business, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I was at La Glaciere, with my friend who is to start\r\na hat factory. We sat talking late, so I preferred to sleep there. Now,\r\nyou know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like being spied upon, so just shut up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman recommenced sobbing. The loud voices and the rough\r\nmovements of Lantier, who upset the chairs, had awakened the children.\r\nThey sat up in bed, half naked, disentangling their hair with their\r\ntiny hands, and, hearing their mother weep, they uttered terrible\r\nscreams, crying also with their scarcely open eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! there\xe2\x80\x99s the music!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Lantier furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake my hook! And it will be for good, this time. You won\xe2\x80\x99t shut up?\r\nThen, good morning! I\xe2\x80\x99ll return to the place I\xe2\x80\x99ve just come from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had already taken his hat from off the chest of drawers. But\r\nGervaise threw herself before him, stammering: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she hushed the little ones\xe2\x80\x99 tears with her caresses, smoothed their\r\nhair, and soothed them with soft words. The children, suddenly quieted,\r\nlaughing on their pillow, amused themselves by punching each other. The\r\nfather however, without even taking off his boots, had thrown himself\r\non the bed looking worn out, his face bearing signs of having been up\r\nall night. He did not go to sleep, he lay with his eyes wide open,\r\nlooking round the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a mess here!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. And after observing Gervaise a moment,\r\nhe malignantly added: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you even wash yourself now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise was twenty-two, tall and slim with fine features, but she was\r\nalready beginning to show the strain of her hard life. She seemed to\r\nhave aged ten years from the hours of agonized weeping. Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s mean\r\nremark made her mad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not fair,\xe2\x80\x9d she said spiritedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou well know I do all I can.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault we find ourselves here. I would like to see you, with\r\ntwo children, in a room where there\xe2\x80\x99s not even a stove to heat some\r\nwater. When we arrived in Paris, instead of squandering your money, you\r\nshould have made a home for us at once, as you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d Lantier exploded. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cracked the nut with me; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbecome you to sneer at it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently not listening, Gervaise went on with her own thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\r\nwork hard we can get out of the hole we\xe2\x80\x99re in. Madame Fauconnier, the\r\nlaundress on Rue Neuve, will start me on Monday. If you work with your\r\nfriend from La Glaciere, in six months we will be doing well. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave enough for decent clothes and a place we can call our own. But\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stick with it and work hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier turned over towards the wall, looking greatly bored. Then\r\nGervaise lost her temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, I know the love of work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you much.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re bursting with ambition, you want to be dressed like a gentleman.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think me nice enough, do you, now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made me pawn\r\nall my dresses? Listen, Auguste, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to speak of it, I\r\nwould have waited a bit longer, but I know where you spent the night; I\r\nsaw you enter the \xe2\x80\x98Grand-Balcony\xe2\x80\x99 with that trollop Adele. Ah! you\r\nchoose them well! She\xe2\x80\x99s a nice one, she is! She does well to put on the\r\nairs of a princess! She\xe2\x80\x99s been the ridicule of every man who frequents\r\nthe restaurant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a bound Lantier sprang from the bed. His eyes had become as black as\r\nink in his pale face. With this little man, rage blew like a tempest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, of every man who frequents the restaurant!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the\r\nyoung woman. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Boche intends to give them notice, she and her\r\nlong stick of a sister, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve always a string of men after\r\nthem on the staircase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier raised his fists; then, resisting the desire of striking her,\r\nhe seized hold of her by the arms, shook her violently and sent her\r\nsprawling upon the bed of the children, who recommenced crying. And he\r\nlay down again, mumbling, like a man resolving on something that he\r\npreviously hesitated to do:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, Gervaise. You\xe2\x80\x99ve made a big mistake;\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor an instant the children continued sobbing. Their mother, who\r\nremained bending over the bed, held them both in her embrace, and kept\r\nrepeating the same words in a monotonous tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for you! My poor little ones! If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for you!\r\nIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStretched out quietly, his eyes raised to the faded strip of chintz,\r\nLantier no longer listened, but seemed to be buried in a fixed idea. He\r\nremained thus for nearly an hour, without giving way to sleep, in spite\r\nof the fatigue which weighed his eyelids down.\r\n\r\nHe finally turned toward Gervaise, his face set hard in determination.\r\nShe had gotten the children up and dressed and had almost finished\r\ncleaning the room. The room looked, as always, dark and depressing with\r\nits sooty black ceiling and paper peeling from the damp walls. The\r\ndilapidated furniture was always streaked and dirty despite frequent\r\ndustings. Gervaise, devouring her grief, trying to assume a look of\r\nindifference, hurried over her work.\r\n\r\nLantier watched as she tidied her hair in front of the small mirror\r\nhanging near the window. While she washed herself he looked at her bare\r\narms and shoulders. He seemed to be making comparisons in his mind as\r\nhis lips formed a grimace. Gervaise limped with her right leg, though\r\nit was scarcely noticeable except when she was tired. To-day, exhausted\r\nfrom remaining awake all night, she was supporting herself against the\r\nwall and dragging her leg.\r\n\r\nNeither one spoke, they had nothing more to say. Lantier seemed to be\r\nwaiting, while Gervaise kept busy and tried to keep her countenance\r\nexpressionless. Finally, while she was making a bundle of the dirty\r\nclothes thrown in a corner, behind the trunk, he at length opened his\r\nlips and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing there? Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer at first. Then, when he furiously repeated his\r\nquestion, she made up her mind, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you can see for yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to wash all this. The\r\nchildren can\xe2\x80\x99t live in filth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let her pick up two or three handkerchiefs. And, after a fresh\r\npause, he resumed: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words she stood up and looked him full in the face, without\r\nleaving go of the children\xe2\x80\x99s dirty clothes, which she held in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney! And where do you think I can have stolen any? You know well\r\nenough that I got three francs the day before yesterday on my black\r\nskirt. We\xe2\x80\x99ve lunched twice off it, and money goes quick at the\r\npork-butcher\xe2\x80\x99s. No, you may be quite sure I\xe2\x80\x99ve no money. I\xe2\x80\x99ve four sous\r\nfor the wash-house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an extra income like some women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe let this allusion pass. He had moved off the bed, and was passing in\r\nreview the few rags hanging about the room. He ended by taking up the\r\npair of trousers and the shawl, and searching the drawers, he added two\r\nchemises and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s loose jacket to the parcel; then, he threw the\r\nwhole bundle into Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s arms, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, go and pop this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want me to pop the children as well?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! If\r\nthey lent on children, it would be a fine riddance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went to the pawn-place, however. When she returned at the end of\r\nhalf an hour, she laid a hundred sou piece on the mantel-shelf, and\r\nadded the ticket to the others, between the two candlesticks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what they gave me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted six francs, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage it. Oh! they\xe2\x80\x99ll never ruin themselves. And there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways such a crowd there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier did not pick up the five franc piece directly. He would rather\r\nthat she got change, so as to leave her some of it. But he decided to\r\nslip it into his waistcoat pocket, when he noticed a small piece of ham\r\nwrapped up in paper, and the remains of a loaf on the chest of drawers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t dare go to the milkwoman\xe2\x80\x99s, because we owe her a week,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexplained Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shall be back early; you can get some bread\r\nand some chops whilst I\xe2\x80\x99m away, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have lunch. Bring also a\r\nbottle of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not say no. Their quarrel seemed to be forgotten. The young\r\nwoman was completing her bundle of dirty clothes. But when she went to\r\ntake Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s shirts and socks from the bottom of the trunk, he called\r\nto her to leave them alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave my things, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x99em touched!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it you don\xe2\x80\x99t want touched?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, rising up. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to put these filthy things on again, do you? They must\r\nbe washed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe studied his boyishly handsome face, now so rigid that it seemed\r\nnothing could ever soften it. He angrily grabbed his things from her\r\nand threw them back into the trunk, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust obey me, for once! I tell you I won\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x99em touched!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning pale, a terrible suspicion crossing her\r\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need your shirts now, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going away. What can\r\nit matter to you if I take them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for an instant, embarrassed by the piercing glance she\r\nfixed upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d stammered he, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you go and tell\r\neveryone that you keep me, that you wash and mend. Well! It worries me,\r\nthere! Attend to your own business and I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to mine, washerwomen\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t work for dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe supplicated, she protested she had never complained; but he roughly\r\nclosed the trunk and sat down upon it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d to her face. He\r\ncould surely do as he liked with what belonged to him! Then, to escape\r\nfrom the inquiring looks she leveled at him, he went and laid down on\r\nthe bed again, saying that he was sleepy, and requesting her not to\r\nmake his head ache with any more of her row. This time indeed, he\r\nseemed to fall asleep. Gervaise, for a while, remained undecided. She\r\nwas tempted to kick the bundle of dirty clothes on one side, and to sit\r\ndown and sew. But Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s regular breathing ended by reassuring her.\r\nShe took the ball of blue and the piece of soap remaining from her last\r\nwashing, and going up to the little ones who were quietly playing with\r\nsome old corks in front of the window, she kissed them, and said in a\r\nlow voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe very good, don\xe2\x80\x99t make any noise; papa\xe2\x80\x99s asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she left the room, Claude\xe2\x80\x99s and Etienne\xe2\x80\x99s gentle laughter alone\r\ndisturbed the great silence beneath the blackened ceiling. It was ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. A ray of sunshine entered by the half open window.\r\n\r\nOn the Boulevard, Gervaise turned to the left, and followed the Rue\r\nNeuve de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. As she passed Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s shop, she\r\nslightly bowed her head. The wash-house she was bound for was situated\r\ntowards the middle of the street, at the part where the roadway\r\ncommenced to ascend.\r\n\r\nThe rounded, gray contours of the three large zinc wash tanks, studded\r\nwith rivets, rose above the flat-roofed building. Behind them was the\r\ndrying room, a high second story, closed in on all sides by\r\nnarrow-slatted lattices so that the air could circulate freely, and\r\nthrough which laundry could be seen hanging on brass wires. The steam\r\nengine\xe2\x80\x99s smokestack exhaled puffs of white smoke to the right of the\r\nwater tanks.\r\n\r\nGervaise was used to puddles and did not bother to tuck her skirts up\r\nbefore making her way through the doorway, which was cluttered with\r\njars of bleaching water. She was already acquainted with the mistress\r\nof the wash-house, a delicate little woman with red, inflamed eyes, who\r\nsat in a small glazed closet with account books in front of her, bars\r\nof soap on shelves, balls of blue in glass bowls, and pounds of soda\r\ndone up in packets; and, as she passed, she asked for her beetle and\r\nher scouring-brush, which she had left to be taken care of the last\r\ntime she had done her washing there. Then, after obtaining her number,\r\nshe entered the wash-house.\r\n\r\nIt was an immense shed, with large clear windows, and a flat ceiling,\r\nshowing the beams supported on cast-iron pillars. Pale rays of light\r\npassed through the hot steam, which remained suspended like a milky\r\nfog. Smoke arose from certain corners, spreading about and covering the\r\nrecesses with a bluish veil. A heavy moisture hung around, impregnated\r\nwith a soapy odor, a damp insipid smell, continuous though at moments\r\noverpowered by the more potent fumes of the chemicals. Along the\r\nwashing-places, on either side of the central alley, were rows of\r\nwomen, with bare arms and necks, and skirts tucked up, showing colored\r\nstockings and heavy lace-up shoes. They were beating furiously,\r\nlaughing, leaning back to call out a word in the midst of the din, or\r\nstooping over their tubs, all of them brutal, ungainly, foul of speech,\r\nand soaked as though by a shower, with their flesh red and reeking.\r\n\r\nAll around the women continuously flowed a river from hot-water buckets\r\nemptied with a sudden splash, cold-water faucets left dripping, soap\r\nsuds spattering, and the dripping from rinsed laundry which was hung\r\nup. It splashed their feet and drained away across the sloping\r\nflagstones. The din of the shouting and the rhythmic beating was joined\r\nby the patter of steady dripping. It was slightly muffled by the\r\nmoisture-soaked ceiling. Meanwhile, the steam engine could be heard as\r\nit puffed and snorted ceaselessly while cloaked in its white mist. The\r\ndancing vibration of its flywheel seemed to regulate the volume of the\r\nnoisy turbulence.\r\n\r\nGervaise passed slowly along the alley, looking to the right and left,\r\ncarrying her laundry bundle under one arm, with one hip thrust high and\r\nlimping more than usual. She was jostled by several women in the\r\nhubbub.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Boche, in her loud voice. Then, when\r\nthe young woman had joined her at the very end on the left, the\r\nconcierge, who was furiously rubbing a dirty sock, began to talk\r\nincessantly, without leaving off her work. \xe2\x80\x9cPut your things there, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nkept your place. Oh, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be long over what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got. Boche\r\nscarcely dirties his things at all. And you, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be long either,\r\nwill you? Your bundle\xe2\x80\x99s quite a little one. Before twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock we\r\nshall have finished, and we can go off to lunch. I used to send my\r\nthings to a laundress in the Rue Poulet, but she destroyed everything\r\nwith her chlorine and her brushes; so now I do the washing myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso much saved; it only costs the soap. I say, you should have put those\r\nshirts to soak. Those little rascals of children, on my word! One would\r\nthink their bodies were covered with soot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, having undone her bundle, was spreading out the little ones\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshirts, and as Madame Boche advised her to take a pailful of lye, she\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! warm water will do. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to it.\xe2\x80\x9d She had sorted\r\nher laundry with several colored pieces to one side. Then, after\r\nfilling her tub with four pails of cold water from the tap behind her,\r\nshe plunged her pile of whites into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re used to it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were a washerwoman in\r\nyour native place, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, with her sleeves pushed back, displayed the graceful arms of\r\na young blonde, as yet scarcely reddened at the elbows, and started\r\nscrubbing her laundry. She spread a shirt out on the narrow rubbing\r\nboard which was water-bleached and eroded by years of use. She rubbed\r\nsoap into the shirt, turned it over, and soaped the other side. Before\r\nreplying to Madame Boche she grasped her beetle and began to pound away\r\nso that her shouted phrases were punctuated with loud and rhythmic\r\nthumps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, a washerwoman\xe2\x80\x94When I was ten\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s twelve years ago\xe2\x80\x94We used\r\nto go to the river\xe2\x80\x94It smelt nicer there than it does here\xe2\x80\x94You should\r\nhave seen, there was a nook under the trees, with clear running\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94You know, at Plassans\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know Plassans?\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s near\r\nMarseilles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you go at it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame Boche, amazed at the strength of\r\nher blows. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could flatten out a piece of iron with your little\r\nlady-like arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued in a very high volume. At times, the\r\nconcierge, not catching what was said, was obliged to lean forward. All\r\nthe linen was beaten, and with a will! Gervaise plunged it into the tub\r\nagain, and then took it out once more, each article separately, to rub\r\nit over with soap a second time and brush it. With one hand she held\r\nthe article firmly on the plank; with the other, which grasped the\r\nshort couch-grass brush, she extracted from the linen a dirty lather,\r\nwhich fell in long drips. Then, in the slight noise caused by the\r\nbrush, the two women drew together, and conversed in a more intimate\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we\xe2\x80\x99re not married,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hide it. Lantier\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t so nice for any one to care to be his wife. If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the\r\nchildren! I was fourteen and he was eighteen when we had our first one.\r\nIt happened in the usual way, you know how it is. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy at\r\nhome. Old man Macquart would kick me in the tail whenever he felt like\r\nit, for no reason at all. I had to have some fun outside. We might have\r\nbeen married, but\xe2\x80\x94I forget why\xe2\x80\x94our parents wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her hands, which were growing red in the white suds. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s awfully hard in Paris.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Boche was now washing only very slowly. She kept leaving off,\r\nmaking her work last as long as she could, so as to remain there, to\r\nlisten to that story, which her curiosity had been hankering to know\r\nfor a fortnight past. Her mouth was half open in the midst of her big,\r\nfat face; her eyes, which were almost at the top of her head, were\r\ngleaming. She was thinking, with the satisfaction of having guessed\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, the little one gossips too much. There\xe2\x80\x99s been a row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, she observed out loud, \xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t nice, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cHe used to behave very well in\r\nthe country; but, since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Paris, he\xe2\x80\x99s been unbearable. I\r\nmust tell you that his mother died last year and left him some\r\nmoney\xe2\x80\x94about seventeen hundred francs. He would come to Paris, so, as\r\nold Macquart was forever knocking me about without warning, I consented\r\nto come away with him. We made the journey with two children. He was to\r\nset me up as a laundress, and work himself at his trade of a hatter. We\r\nshould have been very happy; but, you see, Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious and a\r\nspendthrift, a fellow who only thinks of amusing himself. In short,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s not worth much. On arriving, we went to the Hotel Montmartre, in\r\nthe Rue Montmartre. And then there were dinners, and cabs, and the\r\ntheatre; a watch for himself and a silk dress for me, for he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nunkind when he\xe2\x80\x99s got the money. You understand, he went in for\r\neverything, and so well that at the end of two months we were cleaned\r\nout. It was then that we came to live at the Hotel Boncoeur, and that\r\nthis horrible life began.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted herself. A lump had suddenly risen in her throat, and\r\nshe could scarcely restrain her tears. She had finished brushing the\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go and fetch my hot water,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Boche, greatly disappointed at this break off in the\r\ndisclosures, called to the wash-house boy, who was passing, \xe2\x80\x9cMy little\r\nCharles, kindly get madame a pail of hot water; she\xe2\x80\x99s in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youth took the bucket and brought it back filled. Gervaise paid\r\nhim; it was a sou the pailful. She poured the hot water into the tub,\r\nand soaped the things a last time with her hands, leaning over them in\r\na mass of steam, which deposited small beads of grey vapor in her light\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere put some soda in, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some by me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the concierge,\r\nobligingly.\r\n\r\nAnd she emptied into Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s tub what remained of a bag of soda\r\nwhich she had brought with her. She also offered her some of the\r\nchemical water, but the young woman declined it; it was only good for\r\ngrease and wine stains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s rather a loose fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Madame Boche, returning\r\nto Lantier, but without naming him.\r\n\r\nGervaise, bent almost double, her hands all shriveled, and thrust in\r\namongst the clothes, merely tossed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed several little\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But she suddenly interrupted herself, as Gervaise jumped up,\r\nwith a pale face, and staring wildly at her. Then she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nno! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything! He likes to laugh a bit, I think, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall. For instance, you know the two girls who lodge at my place, Adele\r\nand Virginie. Well, he larks about with \xe2\x80\x99em, but he just flirts for\r\nsport.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman standing before her, her face covered with\r\nperspiration, the water dripping from her arms, continued to stare at\r\nher with a fixed and penetrating look. Then the concierge got excited,\r\ngiving herself a blow on the chest, and pledging her word of honor, she\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing, I mean it when I say so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen calming herself, she added in a gentle voice, as if speaking to a\r\nperson on whom loud protestations would have no effect, \xe2\x80\x9cI think he has\r\na frank look about the eyes. He\xe2\x80\x99ll marry you, my dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise wiped her forehead with her wet hand. Shaking her head again,\r\nshe pulled another garment out of the water. Both of them kept silence\r\nfor a moment. The wash-house was quieting down, for eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock had\r\nstruck. Half of the washerwomen were perched on the edge of their tubs,\r\neating sausages between slices of bread and drinking from open bottles\r\nof wine. Only housewives who had come to launder small bundles of\r\nfamily linen were hurrying to finish.\r\n\r\nOccasional beetle blows could still be heard amid the subdued laughter\r\nand gossip half-choked by the greedy chewing of jawbones. The steam\r\nengine never stopped. Its vibrant, snorting voice seemed to fill the\r\nentire hall, though not one of the women even heard it. It was like the\r\nbreathing of the wash-house, its hot breath collecting under the\r\nceiling rafters in an eternal floating mist.\r\n\r\nThe heat was becoming intolerable. Through the tall windows on the left\r\nsunlight was streaming in, touching the steamy vapors with opalescent\r\ntints of soft pinks and grayish blues. Charles went from window to\r\nwindow, letting down the heavy canvas awnings. Then he crossed to the\r\nshady side to open the ventilators. He was applauded by cries and hand\r\nclapping and a rough sort of gaiety spread around. Soon even the last\r\nof the beetle-pounding stopped.\r\n\r\nWith full mouths, the washerwomen could only make gestures. It became\r\nso quiet that the grating sound of the fireman shoveling coal into the\r\nengine\xe2\x80\x99s firebox could be heard at regular intervals from far at the\r\nother end.\r\n\r\nGervaise was washing her colored things in the hot water thick with\r\nlather, which she had kept for the purpose. When she had finished, she\r\ndrew a trestle towards her and hung across it all the different\r\narticles; the drippings from which made bluish puddles on the floor;\r\nand she commenced rinsing. Behind her, the cold water tap was set\r\nrunning into a vast tub fixed to the ground, and across which were two\r\nwooden bars whereon to lay the clothes. High up in the air were two\r\nother bars for the things to finish dripping on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re almost finished, and not a bad job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwait and help you wring all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth while; I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged though,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young\r\nwoman, who was kneading with her hands and sousing the colored things\r\nin some clean water. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d any sheets, it would be another thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had, however, to accept the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s assistance. They were\r\nwringing between them, one at each end, a woolen skirt of a washed-out\r\nchestnut color, from which dribbled a yellowish water, when Madame\r\nBoche exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s tall Virginie! What has she come here to wash, when all\r\nher wardrobe that isn\xe2\x80\x99t on her would go into a pocket handkerchief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise jerked her head up. Virginie was a girl of her own age, taller\r\nthan she was, dark and pretty in spite of her face being rather long\r\nand narrow. She had on an old black dress with flounces, and a red\r\nribbon round her neck; and her hair was done up carefully, the chignon\r\nbeing enclosed in a blue silk net. She stood an instant in the middle\r\nof the central alley, screwing up her eyes as though seeking someone;\r\nthen, when she caught sight of Gervaise, she passed close to her,\r\nerect, insolent, and with a swinging gait, and took a place in the same\r\nrow, five tubs away from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a freak for you!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Madame Boche in a lower tone of\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cShe never does any laundry, not even a pair of cuffs. A\r\nseamstress who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even sew on a loose button! She\xe2\x80\x99s just like her\r\nsister, the brass burnisher, that hussy Adele, who stays away from her\r\njob two days out of three. Nobody knows who their folks are or how they\r\nmake a living. Though, if I wanted to talk . . . What on earth is she\r\nscrubbing there? A filthy petticoat. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wager it\xe2\x80\x99s seen some lovely\r\nsights, that petticoat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Boche was evidently trying to make herself agreeable to\r\nGervaise. The truth was she often took a cup of coffee with Adele and\r\nVirginia, when the girls had any money. Gervaise did not answer, but\r\nhurried over her work with feverish hands. She had just prepared her\r\nblue in a little tub that stood on three legs. She dipped in the linen\r\nthings, and shook them an instant at the bottom of the colored water,\r\nthe reflection of which had a pinky tinge; and after wringing them\r\nlightly, she spread them out on the wooden bars up above. During the\r\ntime she was occupied with this work, she made a point of turning her\r\nback on Virginie. But she heard her chuckles; she could feel her\r\nsidelong glances. Virginie appeared only to have come there to provoke\r\nher. At one moment, Gervaise having turned around, they both stared\r\ninto each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her alone,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pull\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s hair out, I hope. When I tell you there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to it!\r\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t her, anyhow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, as the young woman was hanging up the last article of\r\nclothing, there was a sound of laughter at the door of the wash-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are two brats who want their mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Charles.\r\n\r\nAll the women leant forward. Gervaise recognized Claude and Etienne. As\r\nsoon as they caught sight of her, they ran to her through the puddles,\r\nthe heels of their unlaced shoes resounding on the flagstones. Claude,\r\nthe eldest, held his little brother by the hand. The women, as they\r\npassed them, uttered little exclamations of affection as they noticed\r\ntheir frightened though smiling faces. And they stood there, in front\r\nof their mother, without leaving go of each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and holding\r\ntheir fair heads erect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas papa sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gervaise.\r\n\r\nBut as she stooped to tie the laces of Etienne\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, she saw the key\r\nof their room on one of Claude\xe2\x80\x99s fingers, with the brass number hanging\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought the key!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, greatly surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child, seeing the key which he had forgotten on his finger,\r\nappeared to recollect, and exclaimed in his clear voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x99s gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone to buy the lunch, and told you to come here to fetch me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClaude looked at his brother, hesitated, no longer recollecting. Then\r\nhe resumed all in a breath: \xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x99s gone away. He jumped off the bed,\r\nhe put all the things in the trunk, he carried the trunk down to a cab.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, who was squatting down, slowly rose to her feet, her face\r\nghastly pale. She put her hands to her cheeks and temples, as though\r\nshe felt her head was breaking; and she could find only these words,\r\nwhich she repeated twenty times in the same tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! good heavens!\xe2\x80\x94ah! good heavens!\xe2\x80\x94ah! good heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Boche, however, also questioned the child, quite delighted at\r\nthe chance of hearing the whole story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, little one, you must tell us just what happened. It was he who\r\nlocked the door and who told you to bring the key, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d And,\r\nlowering her voice, she whispered in Claude\xe2\x80\x99s ear: \xe2\x80\x9cWas there a lady in\r\nthe cab?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child again got confused. Then he recommenced his story in a\r\ntriumphant manner: \xe2\x80\x9cHe jumped off the bed, he put all the things in the\r\ntrunk. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, when Madame Boche let him go, he drew his brother in front of the\r\ntap, and they amused themselves by turning on the water. Gervaise was\r\nunable to cry. She was choking, leaning back against her tub, her face\r\nstill buried in her hands. Brief shudders rocked her body and she\r\nwailed out long sighs while pressing her hands tighter against her\r\neyes, as though abandoning herself to the blackness of desolation, a\r\ndark, deep pit into which she seemed to be falling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my dear, pull yourself together!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Boche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only knew! If you only knew!\xe2\x80\x9d said she at length very faintly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sent me this morning to pawn my shawl and my chemises to pay for\r\nthat cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she burst out crying. The memory of the events of that morning and\r\nof her trip to the pawn-place tore from her the sobs that had been\r\nchoking her throat. That abominable trip to the pawn-place was the\r\nthing that hurt most in all her sorrow and despair. Tears were\r\nstreaming down her face but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of using her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe reasonable, do be quiet, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s looking at you,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Boche,\r\nwho hovered round her, kept repeating. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you worry yourself so\r\nmuch on account of a man? You loved him, then, all the same, did you,\r\nmy poor darling? A little while ago you were saying all sorts of things\r\nagainst him; and now you\xe2\x80\x99re crying for him, and almost breaking your\r\nheart. Dear me, how silly we all are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she became quite maternal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty little woman like you! Can it be possible? One may tell you\r\neverything now, I suppose. Well! You recollect when I passed under your\r\nwindow, I already had my suspicions. Just fancy, last night, when Adele\r\ncame home, I heard a man\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps with hers. So I thought I would\r\nsee who it was. I looked up the staircase. The fellow was already on\r\nthe second landing; but I certainly recognized Monsieur Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\novercoat. Boche, who was on the watch this morning, saw him tranquilly\r\nnod adieu. He was with Adele, you know. Virginie has a situation now,\r\nwhere she goes twice a week. Only it\xe2\x80\x99s highly imprudent all the same,\r\nfor they\xe2\x80\x99ve only one room and an alcove, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t very well say\r\nwhere Virginie managed to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted herself an instant, turned round, and then resumed,\r\nsubduing her loud voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s laughing at seeing you cry, that heartless thing over there. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nstake my life that her washing\xe2\x80\x99s all a pretence. She\xe2\x80\x99s packed off the\r\nother two, and she\xe2\x80\x99s come here so as to tell them how you take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise removed her hands from her face and looked. When she beheld\r\nVirginie in front of her, amidst three or four women, speaking low and\r\nstaring at her, she was seized with a mad rage. Her arms in front of\r\nher, searching the ground, she stumbled forward a few paces. Trembling\r\nall over, she found a bucket full of water, grabbed it with both hands,\r\nand emptied it at Virginie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe virago!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled tall Virginie.\r\n\r\nShe had stepped back, and her boots alone got wet. The other women, who\r\nfor some minutes past had all been greatly upset by Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s tears,\r\njostled each other in their anxiety to see the fight. Some, who were\r\nfinishing their lunch, got on the tops of their tubs. Others hastened\r\nforward, their hands smothered with soap. A ring was formed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the virago!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated tall Virginie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her?\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, standing on the defensive, her chin thrust out, her features\r\nconvulsed, said nothing, not having yet acquired the Paris gift of\r\nstreet gab. The other continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out! This girl\xe2\x80\x99s tired of wallowing about in the country; she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t twelve years old when the soldiers were at her. She even lost\r\nher leg serving her country. That leg\xe2\x80\x99s rotting off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lookers-on burst out laughing. Virginie, seeing her success,\r\nadvanced a couple of steps, drawing herself up to her full height, and\r\nyelling louder than ever:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Come a bit nearer, just to see how I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ncome annoying us here. Do I even know her, the hussy? If she\xe2\x80\x99d wetted\r\nme, I\xe2\x80\x99d have pretty soon shown her battle, as you\xe2\x80\x99d have seen. Let her\r\njust say what I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done to her. Speak, you vixen; what\xe2\x80\x99s been done\r\nto you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk so much,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know well enough. Some\r\none saw my husband last night. And shut up, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmost certainly strangle you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good one! As if cripples like her had husbands!\r\nIf he\xe2\x80\x99s left you it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault. Surely you don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve stolen\r\nhim, do you? He was much too good for you and you made him sick. Did\r\nyou keep him on a leash? Has anyone here seen her husband? There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nreward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laughter burst forth again. Gervaise contented herself with\r\ncontinually murmuring in a low tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know well enough, you know well enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s your sister. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstrangle her\xe2\x80\x94your sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go and try it on with my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Virginie sneeringly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it\xe2\x80\x99s my sister! That\xe2\x80\x99s very likely. My sister looks a trifle\r\ndifferent to you; but what\xe2\x80\x99s that to me? Can\xe2\x80\x99t one come and wash one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes in peace now? Just dry up, d\xe2\x80\x99ye hear, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough\r\nof it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut it was she who returned to the attack, after giving five or six\r\nstrokes with her beetle, intoxicated by the insults she had been giving\r\nutterance to, and worked up into a passion. She left off and\r\nrecommenced again, speaking in this way three times:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes! it\xe2\x80\x99s my sister. There now, does that satisfy you? They\r\nadore each other. You should just see them bill and coo! And he\xe2\x80\x99s left\r\nyou with your children. Those pretty kids with scabs all over their\r\nfaces! You got one of them from a gendarme, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? And you let\r\nthree others die because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to pay excess baggage on your\r\njourney. It\xe2\x80\x99s your Lantier who told us that. Ah! he\xe2\x80\x99s been telling some\r\nfine things; he\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dirty jade! You dirty jade! You dirty jade!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Gervaise,\r\nbeside herself, and again seized with a furious trembling. She turned\r\nround, looking once more about the ground; and only observing the\r\nlittle tub, she seized hold of it by the legs, and flung the whole of\r\nthe bluing at Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe beast! She\xe2\x80\x99s spoilt my dress!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the latter, whose shoulder\r\nwas sopping wet and whose left hand was dripping blue. \xe2\x80\x9cJust wait, you\r\nwretch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn her turn she seized a bucket, and emptied it over Gervaise. Then a\r\nformidable battle began. They both ran along the rows of tubs, seized\r\nhold of the pails that were full, and returned to dash the contents at\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s heads. And each deluge was accompanied by a volley of\r\nwords. Gervaise herself answered now:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you scum! You got it that time. It\xe2\x80\x99ll help to cool you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the carrion! That\xe2\x80\x99s for your filth. Wash yourself for once in your\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wash the salt out of you, you cod!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother one! Brush your teeth, fix yourself up for your post to-night\r\nat the corner of the Rue Belhomme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey ended by having to refill the buckets at the water taps,\r\ncontinuing to insult each other the while. The initial bucketfuls were\r\nso poorly aimed as to scarcely reach their targets, but they soon began\r\nto splash each other in earnest. Virginie was the first to receive a\r\nbucketful in the face. The water ran down, soaking her back and front.\r\nShe was still staggering when another caught her from the side, hitting\r\nher left ear and drenching her chignon which then came unwound into a\r\nlimp, bedraggled string of hair.\r\n\r\nGervaise was hit first in the legs. One pail filled her shoes full of\r\nwater and splashed up to her thighs. Two more wet her even higher. Soon\r\nboth of them were soaked from top to bottom and it was impossible to\r\ncount the hits. Their clothes were plastered to their bodies and they\r\nlooked shrunken. Water was dripping everywhere as from umbrellas in a\r\nrainstorm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look jolly funny!\xe2\x80\x9d said the hoarse voice of one of the women.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the wash-house was highly amused. A good space was left to\r\nthe combatants, as nobody cared to get splashed. Applause and jokes\r\ncirculated in the midst of the sluice-like noise of the buckets emptied\r\nin rapid succession! On the floor the puddles were running one into\r\nanother, and the two women were wading in them up to their ankles.\r\nVirginie, however, who had been meditating a treacherous move, suddenly\r\nseized hold of a pail of lye, which one of her neighbors had left there\r\nand threw it. The same cry arose from all. Everyone thought Gervaise\r\nwas scalded; but only her left foot had been slightly touched. And,\r\nexasperated by the pain, she seized a bucket, without troubling herself\r\nto fill it this time, and threw it with all her might at the legs of\r\nVirginie, who fell to the ground. All the women spoke together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s broken one of her limbs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the other tried to cook her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s right, after all, the blonde one, if her man\xe2\x80\x99s been taken from\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Boche held up her arms to heaven, uttering all sorts of\r\nexclamations. She had prudently retreated out of the way between two\r\ntubs; and the children, Claude and Etienne, crying, choking, terrified,\r\nclung to her dress with the continuous cry of \xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d broken by\r\ntheir sobs. When she saw Virginie fall she hastened forward, and tried\r\nto pull Gervaise away by her skirt, repeating the while,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, go home! Be reasonable. On my word, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite upset me.\r\nNever was such a butchery seen before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she had to draw back and seek refuge again between the two tubs,\r\nwith the children. Virginie had just flown at Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s throat. She\r\nsqueezed her round the neck, trying to strangle her. The latter freed\r\nherself with a violent jerk, and in her turn hung on to the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair, as though she was trying to pull her head off. The battle was\r\nsilently resumed, without a cry, without an insult. They did not seize\r\neach other round the body, they attacked each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces with open\r\nhands and clawing fingers, pinching, scratching whatever they caught\r\nhold of. The tall, dark girl\xe2\x80\x99s red ribbon and blue silk hair net were\r\ntorn off. The body of her dress, giving way at the neck, displayed a\r\nlarge portion of her shoulder; whilst the blonde, half stripped, a\r\nsleeve gone from her loose white jacket without her knowing how, had a\r\nrent in her underlinen, which exposed to view the naked line of her\r\nwaist. Shreds of stuff flew in all directions. It was from Gervaise\r\nthat the first blood was drawn, three long scratches from the mouth to\r\nthe chin; and she sought to protect her eyes, shutting them at every\r\ngrab the other made, for fear of having them torn out. No blood showed\r\non Virginie as yet. Gervaise aimed at her ears, maddened at not being\r\nable to reach them. At length she succeeded in seizing hold of one of\r\nthe earrings\xe2\x80\x94an imitation pear in yellow glass\xe2\x80\x94which she pulled out and\r\nslit the ear, and the blood flowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re killing each other! Separate them, the vixens!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nseveral voices.\r\n\r\nThe other women had drawn nearer. They formed themselves into two\r\ncamps. Some were cheering the combatants on as the others were\r\ntrembling and turning their heads away saying that it was making them\r\nsick. A large fight nearly broke out between the two camps as the women\r\ncalled each other names and brandished their fists threateningly. Three\r\nloud slaps rang out.\r\n\r\nMadame Boche, meanwhile, was trying to discover the wash-house boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharles! Charles! Wherever has he got to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she found him in the front rank, looking on with his arms folded.\r\nHe was a big fellow, with an enormous neck. He was laughing and\r\nenjoying the sight of the skin which the two women displayed. The\r\nlittle blonde was as fat as a quail. It would be fun if her chemise\r\nburst open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he, blinking his eye, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s got a strawberry birthmark\r\nunder her arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You\xe2\x80\x99re there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Boche, as she caught sight of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust come and help us separate them. You can easily separate them, you\r\ncan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no! thank you, not if I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get my eye\r\nscratched like I did the other day, I suppose! I\xe2\x80\x99m not here for that\r\nsort of thing; I have enough to do without that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, a\r\nlittle bleeding does \xe2\x80\x99em good; it\xe2\x80\x99ll soften \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe concierge then talked of fetching the police; but the mistress of\r\nthe wash-house, the delicate young woman with the red, inflamed eyes,\r\nwould not allow her to do this. She kept saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t; it\xe2\x80\x99ll compromise my establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe struggle on the ground continued. All on a sudden, Virginie raised\r\nherself up on her knees. She had just gotten hold of a beetle and held\r\nit on high. She had a rattle in her throat and in an altered voice, she\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99ll settle you! Get your dirty linen ready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise quickly thrust out her hand, and also seized a beetle, and\r\nheld it up like a club; and she too spoke in a choking voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you want to wash. Let me get hold of your skin that I may beat it\r\ninto dish-cloths!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment they remained there, on their knees, menacing each other.\r\nTheir hair all over their faces, their breasts heaving, muddy, swelling\r\nwith rage, they watched one another, as they waited and took breath.\r\nGervaise gave the first blow. Her beetle glided off Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder, and she at once threw herself on one side to avoid the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s beetle, which grazed her hip. Then, warming to their work they\r\nstruck at each other like washerwomen beating clothes, roughly, and in\r\ntime. Whenever there was a hit, the sound was deadened, so that one\r\nmight have thought it a blow in a tub full of water. The other women\r\naround them no longer laughed. Several had gone off saying that it\r\nquite upset them; those who remained stretched out their necks, their\r\neyes lighted up with a gleam of cruelty, admiring the pluck displayed.\r\nMadame Boche had led Claude and Etienne away, and one could hear at the\r\nother end of the building the sound of their sobs, mingled with the\r\nsonorous shocks of the two beetles. But Gervaise suddenly yelled.\r\nVirginie had caught her a whack with all her might on her bare arm,\r\njust above the elbow. A large red mark appeared, the flesh at once\r\nbegan to swell. Then she threw herself upon Virginie, and everyone\r\nthought she was going to beat her to death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough! Enough!\xe2\x80\x9d was cried on all sides.\r\n\r\nHer face bore such a terrible expression, that no one dared approach\r\nher. Her strength seemed to have increased tenfold. She seized Virginie\r\nround the waist, bent her down and pressed her face against the\r\nflagstones. Raising her beetle she commenced beating as she used to\r\nbeat at Plassans, on the banks of the Viorne, when her mistress washed\r\nthe clothes of the garrison. The wood seemed to yield to the flesh with\r\na damp sound. At each whack a red weal marked the white skin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the boy Charles, opening his eyes to their full\r\nextent and gloating over the sight.\r\n\r\nLaughter again burst forth from the lookers-on, but soon the cry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough! Enough!\xe2\x80\x9d recommenced. Gervaise heard not, neither did she\r\ntire. She examined her work, bent over it, anxious not to leave a dry\r\nplace. She wanted to see the whole of that skin beaten, covered with\r\ncontusions. And she talked, seized with a ferocious gaiety, recalling a\r\nwasherwoman\xe2\x80\x99s song,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBang! Bang! Margot at her tub.\r\nBang! Bang! Beating rub-a-dub.\r\nBang! Bang! Tries to wash her heart.\r\nBang! Bang! Black with grief to part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she resumed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for you, that\xe2\x80\x99s for your sister.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s for Lantier.\r\nWhen you next see them,\r\nYou can give them that.\r\nAttention! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to begin again.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s for Lantier, that\xe2\x80\x99s for your sister.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s for you.\r\nBang! Bang! Margot at her tub.\r\nBang! Bang! Beating rub-a-dub\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe others were obliged to drag Virginie away from her. The tall, dark\r\ngirl, her face bathed in tears and purple with shame, picked up her\r\nthings and hastened away. She was vanquished. Gervaise slipped on the\r\nsleeve of her jacket again, and fastened up her petticoats. Her arm\r\npained her a good deal, and she asked Madame Boche to place her bundle\r\nof clothes on her shoulder. The concierge referred to the battle, spoke\r\nof her emotions, and talked of examining the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s person, just\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may, perhaps, have something broken. I heard a tremendous blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Gervaise wanted to go home. She made no reply to the pitying\r\nremarks and noisy ovation of the other women who surrounded her, erect\r\nin their aprons. When she was laden she gained the door, where the\r\nchildren awaited her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hours, that makes two sous,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mistress of the wash-house,\r\nalready back at her post in the glazed closet.\r\n\r\nWhy two sous? She no longer understood that she was asked to pay for\r\nher place there. Then she gave the two sous; and limping very much\r\nbeneath the weight of the wet clothes on her shoulder, the water\r\ndripping from off her, her elbow black and blue, her cheek covered with\r\nblood, she went off, dragging Claude and Etienne with her bare arms,\r\nwhilst they trotted along on either side of her, still trembling, and\r\ntheir faces besmeared with their tears.\r\n\r\nOnce she was gone, the wash-house resumed its roaring tumult. The\r\nwasherwomen had eaten their bread and drunk their wine. Their faces\r\nwere lit up and their spirits enlivened by the fight between Gervaise\r\nand Virginie.\r\n\r\nThe long lines of tubs were astir again with the fury of thrashing\r\narms, of craggy profiles, of marionettes with bent backs and slumping\r\nshoulders that twisted and jerked violently as though on hinges.\r\nConversations went on from one end to the other in loud voices.\r\nLaughter and coarse remarks crackled through the ceaseless gurgling of\r\nthe water. Faucets were sputtering, buckets spilling, rivulets flowing\r\nunderneath the rows of washboards. Throughout the huge shed rising\r\nwisps of steam reflected a reddish tint, pierced here and there by\r\ndisks of sunlight, golden globes that had leaked through holes in the\r\nawnings. The air was stiflingly warm and odorous with soap.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hall was filled with a white mist. The huge copper lid of\r\nthe lye-water kettle was rising mechanically along a notched shaft, and\r\nfrom the gaping copper hollow within its wall of bricks came whirling\r\nclouds of vapor. Meanwhile, at one side the drying machines were hard\r\nat work; within their cast-iron cylinders bundles of laundry were being\r\nwrung dry by the centrifugal force of the steam engine, which was still\r\npuffing, steaming, jolting the wash-house with the ceaseless labor of\r\nits iron limbs.\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise turned into the entry of the Hotel Boncoeur, her tears\r\nagain mastered her. It was a dark, narrow passage, with a gutter for\r\nthe dirty water running alongside the wall; and the stench which she\r\nagain encountered there caused her to think of the fortnight she had\r\npassed in the place with Lantier\xe2\x80\x94a fortnight of misery and quarrels,\r\nthe recollection of which was now a bitter regret. It seemed to bring\r\nher abandonment home to her.\r\n\r\nUpstairs the room was bare, in spite of the sunshine which entered\r\nthrough the open window. That blaze of light, that kind of dancing\r\ngolden dust, exposed the lamentable condition of the blackened ceiling,\r\nand of the walls half denuded of paper, all the more. The only thing\r\nleft hanging in the room was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s small neckerchief, twisted like\r\na piece of string. The children\xe2\x80\x99s bedstead, drawn into the middle of\r\nthe apartment, displayed the chest of drawers, the open drawers of\r\nwhich exposed their emptiness. Lantier had washed himself and had used\r\nup the last of the pomatum\xe2\x80\x94two sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of pomatum in a playing\r\ncard; the greasy water from his hands filled the basin. And he had\r\nforgotten nothing. The corner which until then had been filled by the\r\ntrunk seemed to Gervaise an immense empty space. Even the little mirror\r\nwhich hung on the window-fastening was gone. When she made this\r\ndiscovery, she had a presentiment. She looked on the mantel-piece.\r\nLantier had taken away the pawn tickets; the pink bundle was no longer\r\nthere, between the two odd zinc candlesticks.\r\n\r\nShe hung her laundry over the back of a chair and just stood there,\r\ngazing around at the furniture. She was so dulled and bewildered that\r\nshe could no longer cry. She had only one sou left. Then, hearing\r\nClaude and Etienne laughing merrily by the window, their troubles\r\nalready forgotten, she went to them and put her arms about them, losing\r\nherself for a moment in contemplation of that long gray avenue where,\r\nthat very morning, she had watched the awakening of the working\r\npopulation, of the immense work-shop of Paris.\r\n\r\nAt this hour immense heat was rising from the pavement and from all the\r\nfurnaces in the factories, setting alight a reflecting oven over the\r\ncity and beyond the octroi wall. Out upon this very pavement, into this\r\nfurnace blast, she had been tossed, alone with her little ones. As she\r\nglanced up and down the boulevard, she was seized with a dull dread\r\nthat her life would be fixed there forever, between a slaughter-house\r\nand a hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, towards half-past eleven, one beautiful sunshiny\r\nday, Gervaise and Coupeau, the zinc-worker, were each partaking of a\r\nplum preserved in brandy, at \xe2\x80\x9cl\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir\xe2\x80\x9d kept by Pere Colombe.\r\nCoupeau, who had been smoking a cigarette on the pavement, had\r\nprevailed on her to go inside as she returned from taking home a\r\ncustomer\xe2\x80\x99s washing; and her big square laundress\xe2\x80\x99s basket was on the\r\nfloor beside her, behind the little zinc covered table.\r\n\r\nPere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was at the corner of Rue des Poissonniers\r\nand Boulevard de Rochechouart. The sign, in tall blue letters\r\nstretching from one end to the other said: Distillery. Two dusty\r\noleanders planted in half casks stood beside the doorway. A long bar\r\nwith its tin measuring cups was on the left as you entered. The large\r\nroom was decorated with casks painted a gay yellow, bright with\r\nvarnish, and gleaming with copper taps and hoops.\r\n\r\nOn the shelves above the bar were liquor bottles, jars of fruit\r\npreserved in brandy, and flasks of all shapes. They completely covered\r\nthe wall and were reflected in the mirror behind the bar as colorful\r\nspots of apple green, pale gold, and soft brown. The main feature of\r\nthe establishment, however, was the distilling apparatus. It was at the\r\nrear, behind an oak railing in a glassed-in area. The customers could\r\nwatch its functioning, long-necked still-pots, copper worms\r\ndisappearing underground, a devil\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen alluring to drink-sodden\r\nwork men in search of pleasant dreams.\r\n\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was nearly empty at the lunch hour. Pere Colombe, a heavy\r\nman of forty, was serving a ten year old girl who had asked him to\r\nplace four sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of brandy into her cup. A shaft of sunlight came\r\nthrough the entrance to warm the floor which was always damp from the\r\nsmokers\xe2\x80\x99 spitting. From everything, the casks, the bar, the entire\r\nroom, a liquorish odor arose, an alcoholic aroma which seemed to\r\nthicken and befuddle the dust motes dancing in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was making another cigarette. He was very neat, in a short blue\r\nlinen blouse and cap, and was laughing and showing his white teeth.\r\nWith a projecting under jaw and a slightly snub nose, he had handsome\r\nchestnut eyes, and the face of a jolly dog and a thorough good fellow.\r\nHis coarse curly hair stood erect. His skin still preserved the\r\nsoftness of his twenty-six years. Opposite to him, Gervaise, in a thin\r\nblack woolen dress, and bareheaded, was finishing her plum which she\r\nheld by the stalk between the tips of her fingers. They were close to\r\nthe street, at the first of the four tables placed alongside the\r\nbarrels facing the bar.\r\n\r\nWhen the zinc-worker had lit his cigarette, he placed his elbows on the\r\ntable, thrust his face forward, and for an instant looked without\r\nspeaking at the young woman, whose pretty fair face had that day the\r\nmilky transparency of china. Then, alluding to a matter known to\r\nthemselves alone, and already discussed between them, he simply asked\r\nin a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s to be \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99? you say \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! most decidedly \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 Monsieur Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly replied Gervaise\r\nwith a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to talk to me about that here.\r\nYou know you promised me you would be reasonable. Had I known, I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let you treat me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau kept silence, looking at her intently with a boldness. She sat\r\nstill, at ease and friendly. At the end of a brief silence she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t really mean it. I\xe2\x80\x99m an old woman; I\xe2\x80\x99ve a big boy eight years\r\nold. Whatever could we two do together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Coupeau, blinking his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the others do, of\r\ncourse, get married!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a gesture of feeling annoyed. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\npleasant? One can very well see you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen much of living. No,\r\nMonsieur Coupeau, I must think of serious things. Burdening oneself\r\nnever leads to anything, you know! I\xe2\x80\x99ve two mouths at home which are\r\nnever tired of swallowing, I can tell you! How do you suppose I can\r\nbring up my little ones, if I only sit here talking indolently? And\r\nlisten, besides that, my misfortune has been a famous lesson to me. You\r\nknow I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit about men now. They won\xe2\x80\x99t catch me again for a\r\nlong while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with such cool objectivity that it was clear she had resolved\r\nthis in her mind, turning it about thoroughly.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was deeply moved and kept repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cI feel so sorry for you.\r\nIt causes me a great deal of pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed she, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am sorry, Monsieur Coupeau. But\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take it to heart. If I had any idea of enjoying myself,\r\n_mon Dieu!_, I would certainly rather be with you than anyone else.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good boy and gentle. Only, where\xe2\x80\x99s the use, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\ninclination to wed? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been for the last fortnight, now, at Madame\r\nFauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s. The children go to school. I\xe2\x80\x99ve work, I\xe2\x80\x99m contented. So\r\nthe best is to remain as we are, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she stooped down to take her basket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re making me talk; they must be expecting me at the shop. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\neasily find someone else prettier than I, Monsieur Coupeau, and who\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have two boys to drag about with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at the clock inserted in the frame-work of the mirror, and\r\nmade her sit down again, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry! It\xe2\x80\x99s only eleven thirty-five. I\xe2\x80\x99ve still\r\ntwenty-five minutes. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be afraid that I shall do\r\nanything foolish; there\xe2\x80\x99s the table between us. So you detest me so\r\nmuch that you won\xe2\x80\x99t stay and have a little chat with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her basket down again, so as not to disoblige him; and they\r\nconversed like good friends. She had eaten her lunch before going out\r\nwith the laundry. He had gulped down his soup and beef hurriedly to be\r\nable to wait for her. All the while she chatted amiably, Gervaise kept\r\nlooking out the window at the activity on the street. It was now\r\nunusually crowded with the lunch time rush.\r\n\r\nEverywhere were hurried steps, swinging arms, and pushing elbows. Some\r\nlate comers, hungry and angry at being kept extra long at the job,\r\nrushed across the street into the bakery. They emerged with a loaf of\r\nbread and went three doors farther to the Two-Headed Calf to gobble\r\ndown a six-sou meat dish.\r\n\r\nNext door to the bakery was a grocer who sold fried potatoes and\r\nmussels cooked with parsley. A procession of girls went in to get hot\r\npotatoes wrapped in paper and cups of steaming mussels. Other pretty\r\ngirls bought bunches of radishes. By leaning a bit, Gervaise could see\r\ninto the sausage shop from which children issued, holding a fried chop,\r\na sausage or a piece of hot blood pudding wrapped in greasy paper. The\r\nstreet was always slick with black mud, even in clear weather. A few\r\nlaborers had already finished their lunch and were strolling aimlessly\r\nabout, their open hands slapping their thighs, heavy from eating, slow\r\nand peaceful amid the hurrying crowd. A group formed in front of the\r\ndoor of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Bibi-the-Smoker,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded a hoarse voice, \xe2\x80\x9caren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to\r\nbuy us a round of _vitriol_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive laborers came in and stood by the bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Here\xe2\x80\x99s that thief, Pere Colombe!\xe2\x80\x9d the voice continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want\r\nthe real old stuff, you know. And full sized glasses, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPere Colombe served them as three more laborers entered. More blue\r\nsmocks gathered on the street corner and some pushed their way into the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re foolish! You only think of the present,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise was saying to\r\nCoupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cSure, I loved him, but after the disgusting way in which he\r\nleft me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were talking of Lantier. Gervaise had not seen him again; she\r\nthought he was living with Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s sister at La Glaciere, in the\r\nhouse of that friend who was going to start a hat factory. She had no\r\nthought of running after him. She had been so distressed at first that\r\nshe had thought of drowning herself in the river. But now that she had\r\nthought about it, everything seemed to be for the best. Lantier went\r\nthrough money so fast, that she probably never could have raised her\r\nchildren properly. Oh, she\xe2\x80\x99d let him see his children, all right, if he\r\nbothered to come round. But as far as she was concerned, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant him to touch her, not even with his finger tips.\r\n\r\nShe told all this to Coupeau just as if her plan of life was well\r\nsettled. Meanwhile, Coupeau never forgot his desire to possess her. He\r\nmade a jest of everything she said, turning it into ribaldry and asking\r\nsome very direct questions about Lantier. But he proceeded so gaily and\r\nwhich such a smile that she never thought of being offended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one who beat him,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at length. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! you\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nkind. You just go around whipping people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him with a hearty laugh. It was true, though, she had\r\nwhipped Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s tall carcass. She would have delighted in strangling\r\nsomeone on that day. She laughed louder than ever when Coupeau told her\r\nthat Virginie, ashamed at having shown so much cowardice, had left the\r\nneighborhood. Her face, however, preserved an expression of childish\r\ngentleness as she put out her plump hands, insisting she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nharm a fly.\r\n\r\nShe began to tell Coupeau about her childhood at Plassans. She had\r\nnever cared overmuch for men; they had always bored her. She was\r\nfourteen when she got involved with Lantier. She had thought it was\r\nnice because he said he was her husband and she had enjoyed playing a\r\nhousewife. She was too soft-hearted and too weak. She always got\r\npassionately fond of people who caused her trouble later. When she\r\nloved a man, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of having fun in the present; she was\r\ndreaming about being happy and living together forever.\r\n\r\nAnd as Coupeau, with a chuckle, spoke of her two children, saying they\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t come from under a bolster, she slapped his fingers; she added\r\nthat she was, no doubt made on the model of other women; women thought\r\nof their home, slaved to keep the place clean and tidy, and went to bed\r\ntoo tired at night not to go to sleep at once. Besides, she resembled\r\nher mother, a stout laboring woman who died at her work and who had\r\nserved as beast of burden to old Macquart for more than twenty years.\r\nHer mother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders had been heavy enough to smash through doors,\r\nbut that didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent her from being soft-hearted and madly attracted\r\nto people. And if she limped a little, she no doubt owed that to the\r\npoor woman, whom old Macquart used to belabor with blows. Her mother\r\nhad told her about the times when Macquart came home drunk and brutally\r\nbruised her. She had probably been born with her lame leg as a result\r\nof one of those times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly perceptible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau\r\ngallantly.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head; she knew well enough that it could be seen; at\r\nforty she would look broken in two. Then she added gently, with a\r\nslight laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a funny fancy of yours to fall in love with a\r\ncripple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his elbows still on the table, he thrust his face closer to hers\r\nand began complimenting her in rather dubious language as though to\r\nintoxicate her with his words. But she kept shaking her head \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t allow herself to be tempted although she was flattered by the\r\ntone of his voice. While listening, she kept looking out the window,\r\nseeming to be fascinated by the interesting crowd of people passing.\r\n\r\nThe shops were now almost empty. The grocer removed his last panful of\r\nfried potatoes from the stove. The sausage man arranged the dishes\r\nscattered on his counter. Great bearded workmen were as playful as\r\nyoung boys, clumping along in their hobnailed boots. Other workmen were\r\nsmoking, staring up into the sky and blinking their eyes. Factory bells\r\nbegan to ring in the distance, but the workers, in no hurry, relit\r\ntheir pipes. Later, after being tempted by one wineshop after another,\r\nthey finally decided to return to their jobs, but were still dragging\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nGervaise amused herself by watching three workmen, a tall fellow and\r\ntwo short ones who turned to look back every few yards; they ended by\r\ndescending the street, and came straight to Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99re three fellows who don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\ninclined for work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9cI know the tall one, it\xe2\x80\x99s My-Boots, a comrade of\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was now full. You had to shout to be heard.\r\nFists often pounded on the bar, causing the glasses to clink. Everyone\r\nwas standing, hands crossed over belly or held behind back. The\r\ndrinking groups crowded close to one another. Some groups, by the\r\ncasks, had to wait a quarter of an hour before being able to order\r\ntheir drinks of Pere Colombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! It\xe2\x80\x99s that aristocrat, Young Cassis!\xe2\x80\x9d cried My-Boots, bringing\r\nhis hand down roughly on Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cA fine gentleman, who\r\nsmokes paper, and wears shirts! So we want to do the grand with our\r\nsweetheart; we stand her little treats!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up! Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Coupeau, greatly annoyed.\r\n\r\nBut the other added, with a chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cRight you are! We know what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat, my boy. Muffs are muffs, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his back after leering terribly as he looked at Gervaise. The\r\nlatter drew back, feeling rather frightened. The smoke from the pipes,\r\nthe strong odor of all those men, ascended in the air, already foul\r\nwith the fumes of alcohol; and she felt a choking sensation in her\r\nthroat, and coughed slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a horrible thing it is to drink!\xe2\x80\x9d said she in a low voice.\r\n\r\nAnd she related that formerly at Plassans she used to drink anisette\r\nwith her mother. But on one occasion it nearly killed her, and that\r\ndisgusted her with it; now, she could never touch any liqueurs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, pointing to her glass, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten my plum; only\r\nI must leave the juice, because it would make me ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor himself, Coupeau couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how anyone could drink glass\r\nafter glass of cheap brandy. A brandied plum occasionally could not\r\nhurt, but as for cheap brandy, absinthe and the other strong stuff, no,\r\nnot for him, no matter how much his comrades teased him about it. He\r\nstayed out on the sidewalk when his friends went into low\r\nestablishments. Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s father had smashed his head open one day when\r\nhe fell from the eaves of No. 25 on Rue Coquenard. He was drunk. This\r\nmemory keeps Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s entire family from the drink. Every time Coupeau\r\npassed that spot, he thought he would rather lick up water from the\r\ngutter than accept a free drink in a bar. He would always say: \xe2\x80\x9cIn our\r\ntrade, you have to have steady legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had taken up her basket again. She did not rise from her seat\r\nhowever, but held the basket on her knees, with a vacant look in her\r\neyes and lost in thought, as though the young workman\xe2\x80\x99s words had\r\nawakened within her far-off thoughts of existence. And she said again,\r\nslowly, and without any apparent change of manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu_! I\xe2\x80\x99m not ambitious; I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask for much. My desire is to\r\nwork in peace, always to have bread to eat and a decent place to sleep\r\nin, you know; with a bed, a table, and two chairs, nothing more. If I\r\ncan, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to raise my children to be good citizens. Also, I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nnot to be beaten up, if I ever again live with a man. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my idea\r\nof amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d She pondered, thinking if there was anything else she\r\nwanted, but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything of importance. Then, after a moment\r\nshe went on, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, when one reaches the end, one might wish to die in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s bed. For myself, having trudged through life, I should like to\r\ndie in my bed, in my own home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she rose from her seat. Coupeau, who cordially approved her wishes,\r\nwas already standing up, anxious about the time. But they did not leave\r\nyet. Gervaise was curious enough to go to the far end of the room for a\r\nlook at the big still behind the oak railing. It was chugging away in\r\nthe little glassed-in courtyard. Coupeau explained its workings to her,\r\npointing at the different parts of the machinery, showing her the\r\ntrickling of the small stream of limpid alcohol. Not a single gay puff\r\nof steam was coming forth from the endless coils. The breathing could\r\nbarely be heard. It sounded muffled as if from underground. It was like\r\na sombre worker, performing dark deeds in the bright daylight, strong\r\nbut silent.\r\n\r\nMy-Boots, accompanied by his two comrades, came to lean on the railing\r\nuntil they could get a place at the bar. He laughed, looking at the\r\nmachine. _Tonnerre de Dieu_, that\xe2\x80\x99s clever. There\xe2\x80\x99s enough stuff in its\r\nbig belly to last for weeks. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind if they just fixed the\r\nend of the tube in his mouth, so he could feel the fiery spirits\r\nflowing down to his heels like a river. It would be better than the\r\ntiny sips doled out by Pere Colombe! His two comrades laughed with him,\r\nsaying that My-Boots was quite a guy after all.\r\n\r\nThe huge still continued to trickle forth its alcoholic sweat.\r\nEventually it would invade the bar, flow out along the outer\r\nBoulevards, and inundate the immense expanse of Paris.\r\n\r\nGervaise stepped back, shivering. She tried to smile as she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s foolish, but that still and the liquor gives me the creeps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, returning to the idea she nursed of a perfect happiness, she\r\nresumed: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, ain\xe2\x80\x99t I right? It\xe2\x80\x99s much the nicest isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x94to have\r\nplenty of work, bread to eat, a home of one\xe2\x80\x99s own, and to be able to\r\nbring up one\xe2\x80\x99s children and to die in one\xe2\x80\x99s bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd never to be beaten,\xe2\x80\x9d added Coupeau gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I would never beat\r\nyou, if you would only try me, Madame Gervaise. You\xe2\x80\x99ve no cause for\r\nfear. I don\xe2\x80\x99t drink and then I love you too much. Come, shall it be\r\nmarriage? I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you divorced and make you my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was speaking low, whispering at the back of her neck while she made\r\nher way through the crowd of men with her basket held before her. She\r\nkept shaking her head \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet she turned around to smile at him,\r\napparently happy to know that he never drank. Yes, certainly, she would\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to him, except she had already sworn to herself never to\r\nstart up with another man. Eventually they reached the door and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWhen they left, l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was packed to the door, spilling its hubbub\r\nof rough voices and its heavy smell of vitriol into the street.\r\nMy-Boots could be heard railing at Pere Colombe, calling him a\r\nscoundrel and accusing him of only half filling his glass. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave to come in here. He\xe2\x80\x99d never come back. He suggested to his\r\ncomrades a place near the Barriere Saint-Denis where you drank good\r\nstuff straight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Gervaise when they reached the sidewalk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can breathe\r\nout here. Good-bye, Monsieur Coupeau, and thank you. I must hurry now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her hand as she started along the boulevard, insisting, \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\na walk with me along Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. It\xe2\x80\x99s not much farther for\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see my sister before going back to work. We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep\r\neach other company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the end, Gervaise agreed and they walked beside each other along the\r\nRue des Poissonniers, although she did not take his arm. He told her\r\nabout his family. His mother, an old vest-maker, now had to do\r\nhousekeeping because her eyesight was poor. Her birthday was the third\r\nof last month and she was sixty-two. He was the youngest. One of his\r\nsisters, a widow of thirty-six, worked in a flower shop and lived in\r\nthe Batignolles section, on Rue des Moines. The other sister was thirty\r\nyears old now. She had married a deadpan chainmaker named Lorilleux.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s where he was going now. They lived in a big tenement on the left\r\nside. He ate with them in the evenings; it saved a bit for all of them.\r\nBut he had been invited out this evening and he was going to tell her\r\nnot to expect him.\r\n\r\nGervaise, who was listening to him, suddenly interrupted him to ask,\r\nwith a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re called \xe2\x80\x98Young Cassis,\xe2\x80\x99 Monsieur Coupeau?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a nickname my mates have given me because I\r\ngenerally drink \xe2\x80\x98cassis\xe2\x80\x99 when they force me to accompany them to the\r\nwineshop. It\xe2\x80\x99s no worse to be called Young Cassis than My-Boots, is\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. Young Cassis isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ugly name,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the young\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nAnd she questioned him about his work. He was still working there,\r\nbehind the octroi wall at the new hospital. Oh! there was no want of\r\nwork, he would not be finished there for a year at least. There were\r\nyards and yards of gutters!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI can see the Hotel Boncoeur when I\xe2\x80\x99m up there.\r\nYesterday you were at the window, and I waved my arms, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnotice me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had already gone about a hundred paces along the Rue de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, when he stood still and raising his eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the house. I was born farther on, at No. 22. But this house is,\r\nall the same, a fine block of masonry! It\xe2\x80\x99s as big as a barrack\r\ninside!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise looked up, examining the facade. On the street side, the\r\ntenement had five stories, each with fifteen windows, whose black\r\nshutters with their broken slats gave an air of desolation to the wide\r\nexpanse of wall. Four shops occupied the ground floor. To the right of\r\nthe entrance, a large, greasy hash house, and to the left, a coal\r\ndealer, a notions seller, and an umbrella merchant. The building\r\nappeared even larger than it was because it had on each side a small,\r\nlow building which seemed to lean against it for support. This immense,\r\nsquared-off building was outlined against the sky. Its unplastered side\r\nwalls were as bare as prison walls, except for rows of roughly jutting\r\nstones which suggested jaws full of decayed teeth yawning vacantly.\r\n\r\nGervaise was gazing at the entrance with interest. The high, arched\r\ndoorway rose to the second floor and opened onto a deep porch, at the\r\nend of which could be seen the pale daylight of a courtyard. This\r\nentranceway was paved like the street, and down the center flowed a\r\nstreamlet of pink-stained water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9cno one will eat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise wanted to wait for him in the street. However, she could not\r\nresist going through the porch as far as the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s room on the\r\nright. And there, on the threshold, she raised her eyes. Inside, the\r\nbuilding was six stories high, with four identical plain walls\r\nenclosing the broad central court. The drab walls were corroded by\r\nyellowish spots and streaked by drippings from the roof gutters. The\r\nwalls went straight up to the eaves with no molding or ornament except\r\nthe angles on the drain pipes at each floor. Here the sink drains added\r\ntheir stains. The glass window panes resembled murky water. Mattresses\r\nof checkered blue ticking were hanging out of several windows to air.\r\nClothes lines stretched from other windows with family washing hanging\r\nto dry. On a third floor line was a baby\xe2\x80\x99s diaper, still implanted with\r\nfilth. This crowded tenement was bursting at the seams, spilling out\r\npoverty and misery through every crevice.\r\n\r\nEach of the four walls had, at ground level, a narrow entrance,\r\nplastered without a trace of woodwork. This opened into a vestibule\r\ncontaining a dirt-encrusted staircase which spiraled upward. They were\r\neach labeled with one of the first four letters of the alphabet painted\r\non the wall.\r\n\r\nSeveral large work-shops with weather-blackened skylights were\r\nscattered about the court. Near the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s room was the dyeing\r\nestablishment responsible for the pink streamlet. Puddles of water\r\ninfested the courtyard, along with wood shavings and coal cinders.\r\nGrass and weeds grew between the paving stones. The unforgiving\r\nsunlight seemed to cut the court into two parts. On the shady side was\r\na dripping water tap with three small hens scratching for worms with\r\ntheir filth-smeared claws.\r\n\r\nGervaise slowly gazed about, lowering her glance from the sixth floor\r\nto the paving stones, then raising it again, surprised at the vastness,\r\nfeeling as it were in the midst of a living organ, in the very heart of\r\na city, and interested in the house, as though it were a giant before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs madame seeking for any one?\xe2\x80\x9d called out the inquisitive concierge,\r\nemerging from her room.\r\n\r\nThe young woman explained that she was waiting for a friend. She\r\nreturned to the street; then as Coupeau did not come, she went back to\r\nthe courtyard seized with the desire to take another look. She did not\r\nthink the house ugly. Amongst the rags hanging from the windows she\r\ndiscovered various cheerful touches\xe2\x80\x94a wall-flower blooming in a pot, a\r\ncage of chirruping canaries, shaving-glasses shining like stars in the\r\ndepth of the shadow. A carpenter was singing in his work-shop,\r\naccompanied by the whining of his plane. The blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s hammers were\r\nringing rhythmically.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the apparent wretched poverty, at nearly every open\r\nwindow appeared the begrimed faces of laughing children. Women with\r\npeaceful faces could be seen bent over their sewing. The rooms were\r\nempty of men who had gone back to work after lunch. The whole tenement\r\nwas tranquil except for the sounds from the work-shops below which\r\nserved as a sort of lullaby that went on, unceasingly, always the same.\r\n\r\nThe only thing she did not like was the courtyard\xe2\x80\x99s dampness. She would\r\nwant rooms at the rear, on the sunny side. Gervaise took a few more\r\nsteps into the courtyard, inhaling the characteristic odor of the\r\nslums, comprised of dust and rotten garbage. But the sharp odor of the\r\nwaste water from the dye shop was strong, and Gervaise thought it\r\nsmelled better here than at the Hotel Boncoeur. She chose a window for\r\nherself, the one at the far left with a small window box planted with\r\nscarlet runners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve kept you waiting rather a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau,\r\nwhom she suddenly heard close beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cThey always make an awful\r\nfuss whenever I don\xe2\x80\x99t dine with them, and it was worse than ever to-day\r\nas my sister had bought some veal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as Gervaise had slightly started with surprise, he continued\r\nglancing around in his turn:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were looking at the house. It\xe2\x80\x99s always all let from the top to the\r\nbottom. There are three hundred lodgers, I think. If I had any\r\nfurniture, I would have secured a small room. One would be comfortable\r\nhere, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one would be comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cIn our street at\r\nPlassans there weren\xe2\x80\x99t near so many people. Look, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwindow up on the fifth floor, with the scarlet runners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s obstinate desire made him ask her once more whether\r\nshe would or she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. They could rent a place here as soon as they\r\nfound a bed. She hurried out the arched entranceway, asking him not to\r\nstart that subject again. There was as much chance of this building\r\ncollapsing as there was of her sleeping under the same blanket with\r\nhim. Still, when Coupeau left her in front of Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\nhe was allowed to hold her hand for a moment.\r\n\r\nFor a month the young woman and the zinc-worker were the best of\r\nfriends. He admired her courage, when he beheld her half killing\r\nherself with work, keeping her children tidy and clean, and yet finding\r\ntime at night to do a little sewing. Often other women were hopelessly\r\nmessy, forever nibbling or gadding about, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like them at\r\nall. She was much too serious. Then she would laugh, and modestly\r\ndefend herself. It was her misfortune that she had not always been\r\ngood, having been with a man when only fourteen. Then too, she had\r\noften helped her mother empty a bottle of anisette. But she had learned\r\na few things from experience. He was wrong to think of her as\r\nstrong-willed; her will power was very weak. She had always let herself\r\nbe pushed into things because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt someone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings. Her one hope now was to live among decent people, for living\r\namong bad people was like being hit over the head. It cracks your\r\nskull. Whenever she thought of the future, she shivered. Everything she\r\nhad seen in life so far, especially when a child, had given her lessons\r\nto remember.\r\n\r\nCoupeau, however, chaffed her about her gloomy thoughts, and brought\r\nback all her courage by trying to pinch her hips. She pushed him away\r\nfrom her, and slapped his hands, whilst he called out laughingly that,\r\nfor a weak woman, she was not a very easy capture. He, who always joked\r\nabout everything did not trouble himself regarding the future. One day\r\nfollowed another, that was all. There would always be somewhere to\r\nsleep and a bite to eat. The neighborhood seemed decent enough to him,\r\nexcept for a gang of drunkards that ought to be cleaned out of the\r\ngutters.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was not a bad sort of fellow. He sometimes had really sensible\r\nthings to say. He was something of a dandy with his Parisian working\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s gift for banter, a regular gift of gab, and besides, he was\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nThey had ended by rendering each other all sorts of services at the\r\nHotel Boncoeur. Coupeau fetched her milk, ran her errands, carried her\r\nbundles of clothes; often of an evening, as he got home first from\r\nwork, he took the children for a walk on the exterior Boulevard.\r\nGervaise, in return for his polite attentions, would go up into the\r\nnarrow room at the top of the house where he slept, and see to his\r\nclothes, sewing buttons on his blue linen trousers, and mending his\r\nlinen jackets. A great familiarity existed between them. She was never\r\nbored when he was around. The gay songs he sang amused her, and so did\r\nhis continuous banter of jokes and jibes characteristic of the Paris\r\nstreets, this being still new to her.\r\n\r\nOn Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s side, this continual familiarity inflamed him more and\r\nmore until it began to seriously bother him. He began to feel tense and\r\nuneasy. He continued with his foolish talk, never failing to ask her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will it be?\xe2\x80\x9d She understood what he meant and teased him. He\r\nwould then come to visit her carrying his bedroom slippers, as if he\r\nwere moving in. She joked about it and continued calmly without\r\nblushing at the allusions with which he was always surrounding her. She\r\nstood for anything from him as long as he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get rough. She only\r\ngot angry once when he pulled a strand of her hair while trying to\r\nforce a kiss from her.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of June, Coupeau lost his liveliness. He became most\r\npeculiar. Gervaise, feeling uneasy at some of his glances, barricaded\r\nherself in at night. Then, after having sulked ever since the Sunday,\r\nhe suddenly came on the Tuesday night about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock and knocked\r\nat her room. She would not open to him; but his voice was so gentle and\r\nso trembling that she ended by removing the chest of drawers she had\r\npushed against the door. When he entered, she thought he was ill; he\r\nlooked so pale, his eyes were so red, and the veins on his face were\r\nall swollen. And he stood there, stuttering and shaking his head. No,\r\nno, he was not ill. He had been crying for two hours upstairs in his\r\nroom; he wept like a child, biting his pillow so as not to be heard by\r\nthe neighbors. For three nights past he had been unable to sleep. It\r\ncould not go on like that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Madame Gervaise,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a swelling in his throat and\r\non the point of bursting out crying again; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must end this, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe? We\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get married. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I want. I\xe2\x80\x99ve quite made up my\r\nmind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise showed great surprise. She was very grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Monsieur Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever are you thinking of?\r\nYou know I\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked you for that. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about it\xe2\x80\x94that was\r\nall. Oh, no, no! it\xe2\x80\x99s serious now; think of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, I beg\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he continued to shake his head with an air of unalterable\r\nresolution. He had already thought it all over. He had come down\r\nbecause he wanted to have a good night. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to send him\r\nback to weep again he supposed! As soon as she said \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d he would no\r\nlonger bother her, and she could go quietly to bed. He only wanted to\r\nhear her say \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d They could talk it over on the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 just like that,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be able to accuse me later on of having incited you\r\nto do a foolish thing. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so insistent, Monsieur Coupeau.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t really be sure that you\xe2\x80\x99re in love with me. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nme for a week, it might fade away. Sometimes men get married and then\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s day after day, stretching out into an entire lifetime, and they\r\nget pretty well bored by it all. Sit down there; I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to talk it\r\nover at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen until one in the morning, in the dark room and by the faint light\r\nof a smoky tallow candle which they forgot to snuff, they talked of\r\ntheir marriage, lowering their voices so as not to wake the two\r\nchildren, Claude and Etienne, who were sleeping, both heads on the same\r\npillow. Gervaise kept pointing out the children to Coupeau, what a\r\nfunny kind of dowry they were. She really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t burden him with\r\nthem. Besides, what would the neighbors say? She\xe2\x80\x99d feel ashamed for him\r\nbecause everyone knew about the story of her life and her lover. They\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it decent if they saw them getting married barely two\r\nmonths later.\r\n\r\nCoupeau replied by shrugging his shoulders. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about the\r\nneighbors! He never bothered about their affairs. So, there was Lantier\r\nbefore him, well, so what? What\xe2\x80\x99s so bad about that? She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nconstantly bringing men upstairs, as some women did, even rich ladies!\r\nThe children would grow up, they\xe2\x80\x99d raise them right. Never had he known\r\nbefore such a woman, such sound character, so good-hearted. Anyway, she\r\ncould have been anything, a streetwalker, ugly, lazy and\r\ngood-for-nothing, with a whole gang of dirty kids, and so what? He\r\nwanted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I want you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, bringing his hand down on his knee with\r\na continuos hammering. \xe2\x80\x9cYou understand, I want you. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to\r\nbe said to that, is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle by little, Gervaise gave way. Her emotions began to take control\r\nwhen faced with his encompassing desire. Still, with her hands in her\r\nlap and her face suffused with a soft sweetness, she hesitantly offered\r\nobjections. From outside, through the half-open window, a lovely June\r\nnight breathed in puffs of sultry air, disturbing the candle with its\r\nlong wick gleaming red like a glowing coal. In the deep silence of the\r\nsleeping neighborhood the only sound was the infantile weeping of a\r\ndrunkard lying in the middle of the street. Far away, in the back room\r\nof some restaurant, a violin was playing a dance tune for some late\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was silent. Then, knowing she had no more arguments, he smiled,\r\ntook hold of her hands and pulled her toward him. She was in one of\r\nthose moments of weakness she so greatly mistrusted, persuaded at last,\r\ntoo emotionally stirred to refuse anything or to hurt anyone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings. Coupeau didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that she was giving way. He held her\r\nwrists so tightly as to almost crush them. Together they breathed a\r\nlong sigh that to both of them meant a partial satisfaction of their\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll say \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you worry me!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wish it? Well then, \xe2\x80\x98yes.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah!\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re perhaps doing a very foolish thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe jumped up, and, seizing her round the waist, kissed her roughly on\r\nthe face, at random. Then, as this caress caused a noise, he became\r\nanxious, and went softly and looked at Claude and Etienne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, we must be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cand not wake the\r\nchildren. Good-bye till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went back to his room. Gervaise, all in a tremble, remained\r\nseated on the edge of her bed, without thinking of undressing herself\r\nfor nearly an hour. She was touched; she felt that Coupeau was very\r\nhonorable; for at one moment she had really thought it was all over,\r\nand that he would forget her. The drunkard below, under the window, was\r\nnow hoarsely uttering the plaintive cry of some lost animal. The violin\r\nin the distance had left off its saucy tune and was now silent.\r\n\r\nDuring the following days Coupeau sought to get Gervaise to call some\r\nevening on his sister in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or; but the young\r\nwoman, who was very timid, showed a great dread of this visit to the\r\nLorilleux. She knew that Coupeau had a lingering fear of that\r\nhousehold, even though he certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dependent on his sister, who\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t even the oldest of the family. Mamma Coupeau would certainly\r\ngive her consent at once, as she never refused her only son anything.\r\nThe thing was that the Lorilleuxs were supposed to be earning ten\r\nfrancs a day or more and that gave them a certain authority. Coupeau\r\nwould never dare to get married unless his wife was acceptable to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken to them of you, they know our plans,\xe2\x80\x9d explained he to\r\nGervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now! What a child you are! Let\xe2\x80\x99s call on them this\r\nevening. I\xe2\x80\x99ve warned you, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I? You\xe2\x80\x99ll find my sister rather\r\nstiff. Lorilleux, too, isn\xe2\x80\x99t always very amiable. In reality they are\r\ngreatly annoyed, because if I marry, I shall no longer take my meals\r\nwith them, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be an economy the less. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\r\nthey won\xe2\x80\x99t turn you out. Do this for me, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words only frightened Gervaise the more. One Saturday evening,\r\nhowever, she gave in. Coupeau came for her at half-past eight. She had\r\ndressed herself in a black dress, a crape shawl with yellow palms, and\r\na white cap trimmed with a little cheap lace. During the six weeks she\r\nhad been working, she had saved the seven francs for the shawl, and the\r\ntwo and a half francs for the cap; the dress was an old one cleaned and\r\nmade up afresh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re expecting you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau to her, as they went round by the\r\nRue des Poissonniers. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! they\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to get used to the idea of\r\nmy being married. They seem nice indeed, to-night. And you know if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen gold chains made, it\xe2\x80\x99ll amuse you to watch them. They\r\njust happen to have a pressing order for Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got gold in their room?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gervaise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so; there\xe2\x80\x99s some on the walls, on the floor, in fact\r\neverywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had passed the arched doorway and crossed the courtyard. The\r\nLorilleuxs lived on the sixth floor, staircase B. Coupeau laughingly\r\ntold her to hold the hand-rail tight and not to leave go of it. She\r\nlooked up, and blinked her eyes, as she perceived the tall hollow tower\r\nof the staircase, lighted by three gas jets, one on every second\r\nlanding; the last one, right up at the top looked like a star twinkling\r\nin a black sky, whilst the other two cast long flashes of light, of\r\nfantastic shapes, among the interminable windings of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d said the zinc-worker as he reached the first floor, smiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a strong smell of onion soup. Someone\xe2\x80\x99s having onion soup, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStaircase B, with its gray, dirty steps and hand-rail, its scratched\r\nwalls and chipped plaster, was full of strong kitchen odors. Long\r\ncorridors, echoing with noise, led away from each landing. Doors,\r\npainted yellow, gaped open, smeared black around the latch from dirty\r\nhands. A sink on each landing gave forth a fetid humidity, adding its\r\nstench to the sharp flavor of the cooking of onions. From the basement,\r\nall the way to the sixth floor, you could hear dishes clattering,\r\nsaucepans being rinsed, pots being scraped and scoured.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor Gervaise saw a half-opened door with the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDesigner\xe2\x80\x9d written on it in large letters. Inside were two men sitting\r\nby a table, the dishes cleared away from its oilcloth cover, arguing\r\nfuriously amid a cloud of pipe smoke. The second and third floors were\r\nquieter, and through cracks in the woodwork only such sounds filtered\r\nas the rhythm of a cradle rocking, the stifled crying of a child, a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounding like the dull murmur of running water with no\r\nwords distinct. Gervaise read the various signs on the doors giving the\r\nnames of the occupants: \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Gaudron, wool-carder\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur\r\nMadinier, cardboard boxes.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a fight in progress on the fourth\r\nfloor: a stomping of feet that shook the floor, furniture banged\r\naround, a racket of curses and blows; but this did not bother the\r\nneighbors opposite, who were playing cards with their door opened wide\r\nto admit more air.\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise reached the fifth floor, she had to stop to take a\r\nbreath; she was not used to going up so high; that wall for ever\r\nturning, the glimpses she had of the lodgings following each other,\r\nmade her head ache. Anyway, there was a family almost blocking the\r\nlanding: the father washing the dishes over a small earthenware stove\r\nnear the sink and the mother sitting with her back to the stair-rail\r\nand cleaning the baby before putting it to bed.\r\n\r\nCoupeau kept urging Gervaise along, and they finally reached the sixth\r\nfloor. He encouraged her with a smile; they had arrived! She had been\r\nhearing a voice all the way up from the bottom and she was gazing\r\nupward, wondering where it could be coming from, a voice so clear and\r\npiercing that it had dominated all the other sounds. It came from a\r\nlittle old woman in an attic room who sang while putting dresses on\r\ncheap dolls. When a tall girl came by with a pail of water and entered\r\na nearby apartment, Gervaise saw a tumbled bed on which a man was\r\nsprawled, his eyes fixed on the ceiling. As the door closed behind her,\r\nGervaise saw the hand-written card: \xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Clemence, ironing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow that she had finally made it to the top, her legs weary and her\r\nbreath short, Gervaise leaned over the railing to look down. Now it was\r\nthe gaslight on the first floor which seemed a distant star at the\r\nbottom of a narrow well six stories deep. All the odors and all the\r\nmurmurings of the immense variety of life within the tenement came up\r\nto her in one stifling breath that flushed her face as she hazarded a\r\nworried glance down into the gulf below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a journey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had gone down a long corridor on the left. He turned twice, the\r\nfirst time also to the left, the second time to the right. The corridor\r\nstill continued branching off, narrowing between walls full of\r\ncrevices, with plaster peeling off, and lighted at distant intervals by\r\na slender gas-jet; and the doors all alike, succeeded each other the\r\nsame as the doors of a prison or a convent, and nearly all open,\r\ncontinued to display homes of misery and work, which the hot June\r\nevening filled with a reddish mist. At length they reached a small\r\npassage in complete darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re here,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the zinc-worker. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, keep to the wall;\r\nthere are three steps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Gervaise carefully took another ten steps in the obscurity. She\r\nstumbled and then counted the three steps. But at the end of the\r\npassage Coupeau had opened a door, without knocking. A brilliant light\r\nspread over the tiled floor. They entered.\r\n\r\nIt was a narrow apartment, and seemed as if it were the continuation of\r\nthe corridor. A faded woolen curtain, raised up just then by a string,\r\ndivided the place in two. The first part contained a bedstead pushed\r\nbeneath an angle of the attic ceiling, a cast-iron stove still warm\r\nfrom the cooking of the dinner, two chairs, a table and a wardrobe, the\r\ncornice of which had had to be sawn off to make it fit in between the\r\ndoor and the bedstead. The second part was fitted up as a work-shop; at\r\nthe end, a narrow forge with its bellows; to the right, a vise fixed to\r\nthe wall beneath some shelves on which pieces of old iron lay\r\nscattered; to the left near the window, a small workman\xe2\x80\x99s bench,\r\nencumbered with greasy and very dirty pliers, shears and microscopical\r\nsaws, all very dirty and grimy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau advancing as far as the woolen curtain.\r\n\r\nBut no one answered at first. Gervaise, deeply affected, moved\r\nespecially by the thought that she was about to enter a place full of\r\ngold, stood behind the zinc-worker, stammering and venturing upon nods\r\nof her head by way of bowing. The brilliant light, a lamp burning on\r\nthe bench, a brazier full of coals flaring in the forge, increased her\r\nconfusion still more. She ended however, by distinguishing Madame\r\nLorilleux\xe2\x80\x94little, red-haired and tolerably strong, pulling with all the\r\nstrength of her short arms, and with the assistance of a big pair of\r\npincers, a thread of black metal which she passed through the holes of\r\na draw-plate fixed to the vise. Seated in front of the bench,\r\nLorilleux, quite as small of stature, but more slender in the\r\nshoulders, worked with the tips of his pliers, with the vivacity of a\r\nmonkey, at a labor so minute, that it was impossible to follow it\r\nbetween his scraggy fingers. It was the husband who first raised his\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94a head with scanty locks, the face of the yellow tinge of old wax,\r\nlong, and with an ailing expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it\xe2\x80\x99s you; well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a hurry you know.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t come into the work-room, you\xe2\x80\x99d be in our way. Stay in the\r\nbedroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he resumed his minute task, his face again in the reflection of a\r\nglass globe full of green-colored water, through which the lamp shed a\r\ncircle of bright light over his work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the chairs!\xe2\x80\x9d called out Madame Lorilleux in her turn. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nlady, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Very well, very well!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had rolled the wire and she carried it to the forge, and then,\r\nreviving the fire of the brazier with a large wooden fan, she proceeded\r\nto temper the wire before passing it through the last holes of the\r\ndraw-plate.\r\n\r\nCoupeau moved the chairs forward and seated Gervaise by the curtain.\r\nThe room was so narrow that he could not sit beside her, so he sat\r\nbehind her, leaning over her shoulder to explain the work in progress.\r\nGervaise was intimidated by this strange reception and felt uneasy. She\r\nhad a buzzing in her ears and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear clearly. She thought the\r\nwife looked older than her thirty years and not very neat with her hair\r\nin a pigtail dangling down the back of her loosely worn wrapper. The\r\nhusband, who was only a year older, appeared already an old man with\r\nmean, thin lips, as he sat there working in his shirt sleeves with his\r\nbare feet thrust into down at the heel slippers. Gervaise was dismayed\r\nby the smallness of the shop, the grimy walls, the rustiness of the\r\ntools, and the black soot spread all over what looked like the odds and\r\nends of a scrap-iron peddler\xe2\x80\x99s wares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the gold?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gervaise in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHer anxious glances searched the corners and sought amongst all that\r\nfilth for the resplendence she had dreamt of. But Coupeau burst out\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold?\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy there\xe2\x80\x99s some; there\xe2\x80\x99s some more, and there\xe2\x80\x99s some\r\nat your feet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed successively to the fine wire at which his sister was\r\nworking, and to another roll of wire, similar to the ordinary iron\r\nwire, hanging against the wall close to the vise; then going down on\r\nall fours, he picked up, beneath the wooden screen which covered the\r\ntiled floor of the work-room, a piece of waste, a tiny fragment\r\nresembling the point of a rusty needle. But Gervaise protested; that\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be gold, that blackish piece of metal as ugly as iron! He had\r\nto bite into the piece and show her the gleaming notch made by his\r\nteeth. Then he continued his explanations: the employers provided the\r\ngold wire, already alloyed; the craftsmen first pulled it through the\r\ndraw-plate to obtain the correct size, being careful to anneal it five\r\nor six times to keep it from breaking. It required a steady, strong\r\nhand, and plenty of practice. His sister would not let her husband\r\ntouch the wire-drawing since he was subject to coughing spells. She had\r\nstrong arms for it; he had seen her draw gold to the fineness of a\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nLorilleux, seized with a fit of coughing, almost doubled up on his\r\nstool. In the midst of the paroxysm, he spoke, and said in a choking\r\nvoice, still without looking at Gervaise, as though he was merely\r\nmentioning the thing to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m making the herring-bone chain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau urged Gervaise to get up. She might draw nearer and see. The\r\nchainmaker consented with a grunt. He wound the wire prepared by his\r\nwife round a mandrel, a very thin steel rod. Then he sawed gently,\r\ncutting the wire the whole length of the mandrel, each turn forming a\r\nlink, which he soldered. The links were laid on a large piece of\r\ncharcoal. He wetted them with a drop of borax, taken from the bottom of\r\na broken glass beside him; and he made them red-hot at the lamp beneath\r\nthe horizontal flame produced by the blow-pipe. Then, when he had\r\nsoldered about a hundred links he returned once more to his minute\r\nwork, propping his hands against the edge of the _cheville_, a small\r\npiece of board which the friction of his hands had polished. He bent\r\neach link almost double with the pliers, squeezed one end close,\r\ninserted it in the last link already in place and then, with the aid of\r\na point opened out again the end he had squeezed; and he did this with\r\na continuous regularity, the links joining each other so rapidly that\r\nthe chain gradually grew beneath Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, without her being\r\nable to follow, or well understand how it was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the herring-bone chain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s also the long\r\nlink, the cable, the plain ring, and the spiral. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nherring-bone. Lorilleux only makes the herring-bone chain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe latter chuckled with satisfaction. He exclaimed, as he continued\r\nsqueezing the links, invisible between his black finger-nails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, Young Cassis! I was making a calculation this morning. I\r\ncommenced work when I was twelve years old, you know. Well! Can you\r\nguess how long a herring-bone chain I must have made up till to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his pale face, and blinked his red eye-lids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-six thousand feet, do you hear? Two leagues! That\xe2\x80\x99s something!\r\nA herring-bone chain two leagues long! It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to twist round the\r\nnecks of all the women of the neighborhood. And you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s still\r\nincreasing. I hope to make it long enough to reach from Paris to\r\nVersailles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had returned to her seat, disenchanted and thinking everything\r\nvery ugly. She smiled to be polite to the Lorilleuxs. The complete\r\nsilence about her marriage bothered her. It was the sole reason for her\r\nhaving come. The Lorilleuxs were treating her as some stranger brought\r\nin by Coupeau. When a conversation finally did get started, it\r\nconcerned the building\xe2\x80\x99s tenants. Madame Lorilleux asked her husband if\r\nhe had heard the people on the fourth floor having a fight. They fought\r\nevery day. The husband usually came home drunk and the wife had her\r\nfaults too, yelling in the filthiest language. Then they spoke of the\r\ndesigner on the first floor, an uppity show-off with a mound of debts,\r\nalways smoking, always arguing loudly with his friends. Monsieur\r\nMadinier\xe2\x80\x99s cardboard business was barely surviving. He had let two girl\r\nworkers go yesterday. The business ate up all his money, leaving his\r\nchildren to run around in rags. And that Madame Gaudron was pregnant\r\nagain; this was almost indecent at her age. The landlord was going to\r\nevict the Coquets on the fifth floor. They owed nine months\xe2\x80\x99 rent, and\r\nbesides, they insisted on lighting their stove out on the landing. Last\r\nSaturday the old lady on the sixth floor, Mademoiselle Remanjou, had\r\narrived just in time to save the Linguerlot child from being badly\r\nburned. Mademoiselle Clemence, one who took in ironing, well, she lived\r\nlife as she pleased. She was so kind to animals though and had such a\r\ngood heart that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything against her. It was a pity, a\r\nfine girl like her, the company she kept. She\xe2\x80\x99d be walking the streets\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, here\xe2\x80\x99s one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorilleux to his wife, giving her the piece of\r\nchain he had been working on since his lunch. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can trim it.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nadded, with the persistence of a man who does not easily relinquish a\r\njoke: \xe2\x80\x9cAnother four feet and a half. That brings me nearer to\r\nVersailles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux, after tempering it again, trimmed it by passing it\r\nthrough the regulating draw-plate. Then she put it in a little copper\r\nsaucepan with a long handle, full of lye-water, and placed it over the\r\nfire of the forge. Gervaise, again pushed forward by Coupeau, had to\r\nfollow this last operation. When the chain was thoroughly cleansed, it\r\nappeared a dull red color. It was finished, and ready to be delivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re always delivered like that, in their rough state,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nzinc-worker explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThe polishers rub them afterwards with cloths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise felt her courage failing her. The heat, more and more intense,\r\nwas suffocating her. They kept the door shut, because Lorilleux caught\r\ncold from the least draught. Then as they still did not speak of the\r\nmarriage, she wanted to go away and gently pulled Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s jacket. He\r\nunderstood. Besides, he also was beginning to feel ill at ease and\r\nvexed at their affectation of silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re off,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t keep you from your work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved about for a moment, waiting, hoping for a word or some\r\nallusion or other. At length he decided to broach the subject himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Lorilleux, we\xe2\x80\x99re counting on you to be my wife\xe2\x80\x99s witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chainmaker pretended, with a chuckle, to be greatly surprised;\r\nwhilst his wife, leaving her draw-plates, placed herself in the middle\r\nof the work-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s serious then?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he. \xe2\x80\x9cThat confounded Young Cassis, one\r\nnever knows whether he is joking or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes, madame\xe2\x80\x99s the person involved,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wife in her turn, as\r\nshe stared rudely at Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ We\xe2\x80\x99ve no advice to give\r\nyou, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s a funny idea to go and get married, all the same.\r\nAnyhow, it\xe2\x80\x99s your own wish. When it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed, one\xe2\x80\x99s only got\r\noneself to blame, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often succeed, not often,\r\nnot often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered these last words slower and slower, and shaking her head,\r\nshe looked from the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s face to her hands, and then to her\r\nfeet as though she had wished to undress her and see the very pores of\r\nher skin. She must have found her better than she expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is perfectly free,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued more stiffly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt\r\nthe family might have wished\xe2\x80\x94one always makes projects. But things take\r\nsuch funny turns. For myself, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any unpleasantness.\r\nHad he brought us the lowest of the low, I should merely have said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marry her and go to blazes!\xe2\x80\x99 He was not badly off though, here with\r\nus. He\xe2\x80\x99s fat enough; one can very well see he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fast much; and he\r\nalways found his soup hot right on time. I say, Lorilleux, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nthink madame\xe2\x80\x99s like Therese\xe2\x80\x94you know who I mean, that woman who used to\r\nlive opposite, and who died of consumption?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain resemblance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the chainmaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two children, madame? Now, I must admit I said to my\r\nbrother: \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand how you can want to marry a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot two children.\xe2\x80\x99 You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be offended if I consult his interests;\r\nits only natural. You don\xe2\x80\x99t look strong either. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\r\nLorilleux, that madame doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look very strong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, she\xe2\x80\x99s not strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey did not mention her leg; but Gervaise understood by their side\r\nglances, and the curling of their lips, that they were alluding to it.\r\nShe stood before them, wrapped in her thin shawl with the yellow palms,\r\nreplying in monosyllables, as though in the presence of her judges.\r\nCoupeau, seeing she was suffering, ended by exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with it. What you are talking about isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimportant. The wedding will take place on Saturday, July 29. I\r\ncalculated by the almanac. Is it settled? Does it suit you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said his sister. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no necessity\r\nto consult us. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t prevent Lorilleux being witness. I only want\r\npeace and quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, hanging her head, not knowing what to do with herself had put\r\nthe toe of her boot through one of the openings in the wooden screen\r\nwhich covered the tiled floor of the work-room; then afraid of having\r\ndisturbed something when she had withdrawn it, she stooped down and\r\nfelt about with her hand. Lorilleux hastily brought the lamp, and he\r\nexamined her fingers suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tiny bits of gold stick to the\r\nshoes, and get carried away without one knowing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all to do with business. The employers didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow a single\r\nspeck for waste. He showed her the rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s foot he used to brush off\r\nany flecks of gold left on the _cheville_ and the leather he kept on\r\nhis lap to catch any gold that fell. Twice weekly the shop was swept\r\nout carefully, the sweepings collected and burned and the ashes sifted.\r\nThis recovered up to twenty-five or thirty francs\xe2\x80\x99 worth of gold a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux could not take her eyes from Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to get angry,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she with an amiable smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, perhaps madame would not mind looking at the soles of her shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Gervaise, turning very red, sat down again, and holding up her feet\r\nshowed that there was nothing clinging to them. Coupeau had opened the\r\ndoor, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night!\xe2\x80\x9d in an abrupt tone of voice. He called\r\nto her from the corridor. Then she in her turn went off, after\r\nstammering a few polite words: she hoped to see them again, and that\r\nthey would all agree well together. Both of the Lorilleux had already\r\ngone back to their work at the far end of their dark hole of a\r\nwork-room. Madame Lorilleux, her skin reflecting the red glow from the\r\nbed of coals, was drawing on another wire, each effort swelling her\r\nneck and making the strained muscles stand out like taut cords. Her\r\nhusband, hunched over beneath the greenish gleam of the globe was\r\nstarting another length of chain, twisting each link with his pliers,\r\npressing it on one side, inserting it into the next link above, opening\r\nit again with the pointed tool, continuously, mechanically, not wasting\r\na motion, even to wipe the sweat from his face.\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise emerged from the corridor on to the landing, she could\r\nnot help saying, with tears in her eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t promise much happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau shook his head furiously. He would get even with Lorilleux for\r\nthat evening. Had anyone ever seen such a miserly fellow? To think that\r\nthey were going to walk off with two or three grains of his gold dust!\r\nAll the fuss they made was from pure avarice. His sister thought\r\nperhaps that he would never marry, so as to enable her to economize\r\nfour sous on her dinner every day. However, it would take place all the\r\nsame on July 29. He did not care a hang for them!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Gervaise still felt depressed. Tormented by a foolish\r\nfearfulness, she peered anxiously into every dark shadow along the\r\nstair-rail as she descended. It was dark and deserted at this hour, lit\r\nonly by a single gas jet on the second floor. In the shadowy depths of\r\nthe dark pit, it gave a spot of brightness, even with its flame turned\r\nso low. It was now silent behind the closed doors; the weary laborers\r\nhad gone to sleep after eating. However, there was a soft laugh from\r\nMademoiselle Clemence\xe2\x80\x99s room and a ray of light shone through the\r\nkeyhole of Mademoiselle Remanjou\xe2\x80\x99s door. She was still busy cutting out\r\ndresses for the dolls. Downstairs at Madame Gaudron\xe2\x80\x99s, a child was\r\ncrying. The sinks on the landings smelled more offensive than ever in\r\nthe midst of the darkness and stillness.\r\n\r\nIn the courtyard, Gervaise turned back for a last look at the tenement\r\nas Coupeau called out to the concierge. The building seemed to have\r\ngrown larger under the moonless sky. The drip-drip of water from the\r\nfaucet sounded loud in the quiet. Gervaise felt that the building was\r\nthreatening to suffocate her and a chill went through her body. It was\r\na childish fear and she smiled at it a moment later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch your step,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Coupeau.\r\n\r\nTo get to the entrance, Gervaise had to jump over a wide puddle that\r\nhad drained from the dye shop. The puddle was blue now, the deep blue\r\nof a summer sky. The reflections from the night light of the concierge\r\nsparkled in it like stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nGervaise did not want to have a wedding-party! What was the use of\r\nspending money? Besides, she still felt somewhat ashamed; it seemed to\r\nher quite unnecessary to parade the marriage before the whole\r\nneighborhood. But Coupeau cried out at that. One could not be married\r\nwithout having a feed. He did not care a button for the people of the\r\nneighborhood! Nothing elaborate, just a short walk and a rabbit ragout\r\nin the first eating-house they fancied. No music with dessert. Just a\r\nglass or two and then back home.\r\n\r\nThe zinc-worker, chaffing and joking, at length got the young woman to\r\nconsent by promising her that there should be no larks. He would keep\r\nhis eye on the glasses, to prevent sunstrokes. Then he organized a sort\r\nof picnic at five francs a head, at the \xe2\x80\x9cSilver Windmill,\xe2\x80\x9d kept by\r\nAuguste, on the Boulevard de la Chapelle. It was a small cafe with\r\nmoderate charges and had a dancing place in the rear, beneath the three\r\nacacias in the courtyard. They would be very comfortable on the first\r\nfloor. During the next ten days, he got hold of guests in the house\r\nwhere his sister lived in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Madinier,\r\nMademoiselle Remanjou, Madame Gaudron and her husband. He even ended by\r\ngetting Gervaise to consent to the presence of two of his\r\ncomrades\xe2\x80\x94Bibi-the-Smoker and My-Boots. No doubt My-Boots was a boozer;\r\nbut then he had such a fantastic appetite that he was always asked to\r\njoin those sort of gatherings, just for the sight of the caterer\xe2\x80\x99s mug\r\nwhen he beheld that bottomless pit swallowing his twelve pounds of\r\nbread. The young woman on her side, promised to bring her employer\r\nMadame Fauconnier and the Boches, some very agreeable people. On\r\ncounting, they found there would be fifteen to sit down to table, which\r\nwas quite enough. When there are too many, they always wind up by\r\nquarrelling.\r\n\r\nCoupeau however, had no money. Without wishing to show off, he intended\r\nto behave handsomely. He borrowed fifty francs of his employer. Out of\r\nthat, he first of all purchased the wedding-ring\xe2\x80\x94a twelve franc gold\r\nwedding-ring, which Lorilleux procured for him at the wholesale price\r\nof nine francs. He then bought himself a frock coat, a pair of trousers\r\nand a waistcoat at a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s in the Rue Myrrha, to whom he gave merely\r\ntwenty-five francs on account; his patent leather shoes and his hat\r\nwere still good enough. When he had put by the ten francs for his and\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s share of the feast\xe2\x80\x94the two children not being charged for\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad exactly six francs left\xe2\x80\x94the price of a low mass at the altar of the\r\npoor. He had no liking for those black crows, the priests. It would\r\ngripe him to pay his last six francs to keep their whistles wet;\r\nhowever, a marriage without a mass wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a real marriage at all.\r\n\r\nGoing to the church himself, he bargained for a whole hour with a\r\nlittle old priest in a dirty cassock who was as sharp at dealing as a\r\npush-cart peddler. Coupeau felt like boxing his ears. For a joke, he\r\nasked the priest if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a second-hand mass that would do for\r\na modest young couple. The priest, mumbling that God would take small\r\npleasure in blessing their union, finally let him have his mass for\r\nfive francs. Well after all, that meant twenty sous saved.\r\n\r\nGervaise also wanted to look decent. As soon as the marriage was\r\nsettled, she made her arrangements, worked extra time in the evenings,\r\nand managed to put thirty francs on one side. She had a great longing\r\nfor a little silk mantle marked thirteen francs in the Rue du Faubourg\r\nPoissonniere. She treated herself to it, and then bought for ten francs\r\noff the husband of a washerwoman who had died in Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse a blue woolen dress, which she altered to fit herself. With the\r\nseven francs remaining she procured a pair of cotton gloves, a rose for\r\nher cap, and some shoes for Claude, her eldest boy. Fortunately the\r\nyoungsters\xe2\x80\x99 blouses were passable. She spent four nights cleaning\r\neverything, and mending the smallest holes in her stockings and\r\nchemise.\r\n\r\nOn Friday night, the eve of the great day, Gervaise and Coupeau had\r\nstill a good deal of running about to do up till eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after\r\nreturning home from work. Then before separating for the night they\r\nspent an hour together in the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s room, happy at being about\r\nto be released from their awkward position. In spite of the fact that\r\nthey had originally resolved not to put themselves out to impress the\r\nneighbors, they had ended by taking it seriously and working themselves\r\ntill they were weary. By the time they said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d they were\r\nalmost asleep on their feet. They breathed a great sigh of relief now\r\nthat everything was ready.\r\n\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses were to be Monsieur Madinier and Bibi-the-Smoker.\r\nThey were counting on Lorilleux and Boche for Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses.\r\nThey were to go quietly to the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office and the church, just the\r\nsix of them, without a whole procession of people trailing behind them.\r\nThe bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s two sisters had even declared that they would stay\r\nhome, their presence not being necessary. Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s mother, however,\r\nhad sobbed and wailed, threatening to go ahead of them and hide herself\r\nin some corner of the church, until they had promised to take her\r\nalong. The meeting of the guests was set for one o\xe2\x80\x99clock at the Silver\r\nWindmill. From there, they would go to Saint-Denis, going out by\r\nrailroad and returning on foot along the highway in order to work up an\r\nappetite. The party promised to be quite all right.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, while getting dressed, Coupeau felt a qualm of\r\nuneasiness in view of the single franc in his pocket. He began to think\r\nthat it was a matter of ordinary courtesy to offer a glass of wine and\r\na slice of ham to the witnesses while awaiting dinner. Also, there\r\nmight be unforeseen expenses. So, after taking Claude and Etienne to\r\nstay with Madame Boche, who was to bring them to the dinner later that\r\nafternoon, he hurried over to the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or to borrow ten\r\nfrancs from Lorilleux. Having to do that griped him immensely as he\r\ncould guess the attitude his brother-in-law would take. The latter did\r\ngrumble a bit, but ended by lending him two five-franc pieces. However,\r\nCoupeau overheard his sister muttering under her breath, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a\r\nfine beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ceremony at the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s was to take place at half-past ten. It was\r\nbeautiful weather\xe2\x80\x94a magnificent sun seemed to roast the streets. So as\r\nnot to be stared at the bride and bridegroom, the old mother, and the\r\nfour witnesses separated into two bands. Gervaise walked in front with\r\nLorilleux, who gave her his arm; whilst Monsieur Madinier followed with\r\nmother Coupeau. Then, twenty steps behind on the opposite side of the\r\nway, came Coupeau, Boche, and Bibi-the-Smoker. These three were in\r\nblack frock coats, walking erect and swinging their arms. Boche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrousers were bright yellow. Bibi-the-Smoker didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a waistcoat so\r\nhe was buttoned up to the neck with only a bit of his cravat showing.\r\nThe only one in a full dress suit was Monsieur Madinier and passers-by\r\ngazed at this well-dressed gentleman escorting the huge bulk of mother\r\nCoupeau in her green shawl and black bonnet with red ribbons.\r\n\r\nGervaise looked very gay and sweet in her dress of vivid blue and with\r\nher new silk mantle fitted tightly to her shoulders. She listened\r\npolitely to the sneering remarks of Lorilleux, who seemed buried in the\r\ndepths of the immense overcoat he was wearing. From time to time,\r\nGervaise would turn her head a little to smile brightly at Coupeau, who\r\nwas rather uncomfortable under the hot sun in his new clothes.\r\n\r\nThough they walked very slowly, they arrived at the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s quite half\r\nan hour too soon. And as the mayor was late, their turn was not reached\r\ntill close upon eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. They sat down on some chairs and waited\r\nin a corner of the apartment, looking by turns at the high ceiling and\r\nbare walls, talking low, and over-politely pushing back their chairs\r\neach time that one of the attendants passed. Yet among themselves they\r\ncalled the mayor a sluggard, saying he must be visiting his blonde to\r\nget a massage for his gout, or that maybe he\xe2\x80\x99d swallowed his official\r\nsash.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the mayor did put in his appearance, they rose\r\nrespectfully in his honor. They were asked to sit down again and they\r\nhad to wait through three other marriages. The hall was crowded with\r\nthe three bourgeois wedding parties: brides all in white, little girls\r\nwith carefully curled hair, bridesmaids wearing wide sashes, an endless\r\nprocession of ladies and gentlemen dressed in their best and looking\r\nvery stylish.\r\n\r\nWhen at length they were called, they almost missed being married\r\naltogether, Bibi-the-Smoker having disappeared. Boche discovered him\r\noutside smoking his pipe. Well! They were a nice lot inside there to\r\nhumbug people about like that, just because one hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yellow kid\r\ngloves to shove under their noses! And the various formalities\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nreading of the Code, the different questions to be put, the signing of\r\nall the documents\xe2\x80\x94were all got through so rapidly that they looked at\r\neach other with an idea that they had been robbed of a good half of the\r\nceremony. Gervaise, dizzy, her heart full, pressed her handkerchief to\r\nher lips. Mother Coupeau wept bitterly. All had signed the register,\r\nwriting their names in big struggling letters with the exception of the\r\nbridegroom, who not being able to write, had put his cross. They each\r\ngave four sous for the poor. When an attendant handed Coupeau the\r\nmarriage certificate, the latter, prompted by Gervaise who nudged his\r\nelbow, handed him another five sous.\r\n\r\nIt was a fair walk from the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s office in the town hall to the\r\nchurch. The men stopped along the way to have a beer. Mother Coupeau\r\nand Gervaise took cassis with water. Then they had to trudge along the\r\nlong street where the sun glared straight down without the relief of\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the church they were hurried along and asked if\r\nthey came so late in order to make a mockery of religion. A priest came\r\nforward, his face pale and resentful from having to delay his lunch. An\r\naltar boy in a soiled surplice ran before him.\r\n\r\nThe mass went very fast, with the priest turning, bowing his head,\r\nspreading out his arms, making all the ritual gestures in haste while\r\ncasting sidelong glances at the group. Gervaise and Coupeau, before the\r\naltar, were embarrassed, not knowing when they should kneel or rise or\r\nseat themselves, expecting some indication from the attendant. The\r\nwitnesses, not knowing what was proper, remained standing during the\r\nceremony. Mother Coupeau was weeping again and shedding her tears into\r\nthe missal she had borrowed from a neighbor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the noon chimes had sounded and the church began to fill\r\nwith noise from the shuffling feet of sacristans and the clatter of\r\nchairs being put back in place. The high altar was apparently being\r\nprepared for some special ceremony.\r\n\r\nThus, in the depths of this obscure chapel, amid the floating dust, the\r\nsurly priest placed his withered hands on the bared heads of Gervaise\r\nand Coupeau, blessing their union amid a hubbub like that of moving\r\nday. The wedding party signed another registry, this time in the\r\nsacristy, and then found themselves out in the bright sunlight before\r\nthe church doors where they stood for a moment, breathless and confused\r\nfrom having been carried along at such a break-neck speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoila!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau with an embarrassed laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it sure didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake long. They shove it at you so; it\xe2\x80\x99s like being at the painless\r\ndentist\xe2\x80\x99s who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give you time to cry out. Here you get a painless\r\nwedding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a quick job,\xe2\x80\x9d Lorilleux smirked. \xe2\x80\x9cIn five minutes you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntied together for the rest of your life. You poor Young Cassis, you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four witnesses whacked Coupeau on the shoulders as he arched his\r\nback against the friendly blows. Meanwhile Gervaise was hugging and\r\nkissing mother Coupeau, her eyes moist, a smile lighting her face. She\r\nreplied reassuringly to the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s sobbing: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do\r\nmy best. I want so much to have a happy life. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work out it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be my fault. Anyhow, it\xe2\x80\x99s done now. It\xe2\x80\x99s up to us to get along\r\ntogether and do the best we can for each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that they went straight to the Silver Windmill. Coupeau had taken\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s arm. They walked quickly, laughing as though carried away,\r\nquite two hundred steps ahead of the others, without noticing the\r\nhouses or the passers-by, or the vehicles. The deafening noises of the\r\nfaubourg sounded like bells in their ears. When they reached the\r\nwineshop, Coupeau at once ordered two bottles of wine, some bread and\r\nsome slices of ham, to be served in the little glazed closet on the\r\nground floor, without plates or table cloth, simply to have a snack.\r\nThen, noticing that Boche and Bibi-the-Smoker seemed to be very hungry,\r\nhe had a third bottle brought, as well as a slab of brie cheese. Mother\r\nCoupeau was not hungry, being too choked up to be able to eat. Gervaise\r\nfound herself very thirsty, and drank several large glasses of water\r\nwith a small amount of wine added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll settle for this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, going at once to the bar, where\r\nhe paid four francs and five sous.\r\n\r\nIt was now one o\xe2\x80\x99clock and the other guests began to arrive. Madame\r\nFauconnier, a fat woman, still good looking, first put in an\r\nappearance; she wore a chintz dress with a flowery pattern, a pink tie\r\nand a cap over-trimmed with flowers. Next came Mademoiselle Remanjou,\r\nlooking very thin in the eternal black dress which she seemed to keep\r\non even when she went to bed; and the two Gaudrons\xe2\x80\x94the husband, like\r\nsome heavy animal and almost bursting his brown jacket at the slightest\r\nmovement, the wife, an enormous woman, whose figure indicated evident\r\nsigns of an approaching maternity and whose stiff violet colored skirt\r\nstill more increased her rotundity. Coupeau explained that they were\r\nnot to wait for My-Boots; his comrade would join the party on the Route\r\nde Saint-Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame Lerat as she entered, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll pour in torrents\r\nsoon! That\xe2\x80\x99ll be pleasant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she called everyone to the door of the wineshop to see the clouds\r\nas black as ink which were rising rapidly to the south of Paris. Madame\r\nLerat, eldest of the Coupeaus, was a tall, gaunt woman who talked\r\nthrough her nose. She was unattractively dressed in a puce-colored robe\r\nthat hung loosely on her and had such long dangling fringes that they\r\nmade her look like a skinny poodle coming out of the water. She\r\nbrandished her umbrella like a club. After greeting Gervaise, she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea. The heat in the street is like a slap on the face.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d think someone was throwing fire at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone agreed that they knew the storm was coming. It was in the air.\r\nMonsieur Madinier said that he had seen it as they were coming out of\r\nthe church. Lorilleux mentioned that his corns were aching and he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to sleep since three in the morning. A storm was due.\r\nIt had been much too hot for three days in a row.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe it will just be a little mist,\xe2\x80\x9d Coupeau said several\r\ntimes, standing at the door and anxiously studying the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\r\nhave to wait only for my sister. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start as soon as she arrives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux was late. Madame Lerat had stopped by so they could\r\ncome together, but found her only beginning to get dressed. The two\r\nsisters had argued. The widow whispered in her brother\xe2\x80\x99s ear, \xe2\x80\x9cI left\r\nher flat! She\xe2\x80\x99s in a dreadful mood. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the wedding party had to wait another quarter of an hour, walking\r\nabout the wineshop, elbowed and jostled in the midst of the men who\r\nentered to drink a glass of wine at the bar. Now and again Boche, or\r\nMadame Fauconnier, or Bibi-the-Smoker left the others and went to the\r\nedge of the pavement, looking up at the sky. The storm was not passing\r\nover at all; a darkness was coming on and puffs of wind, sweeping along\r\nthe ground, raised little clouds of white dust. At the first clap of\r\nthunder, Mademoiselle Remanjou made the sign of the cross. All the\r\nglances were anxiously directed to the clock over the looking-glass; it\r\nwas twenty minutes to two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it goes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the angels who\xe2\x80\x99re weeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gush of rain swept the pavement, along which some women flew, holding\r\ndown their skirts with both hands. And it was in the midst of this\r\nfirst shower that Madame Lorilleux at length arrived, furious and out\r\nof breath, and struggling on the threshold with her umbrella that would\r\nnot close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid any one ever see such a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt caught me just\r\nat the door. I felt inclined to go upstairs again and take my things\r\noff. I should have been wise had I done so. Ah! it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty wedding!\r\nI said how it would be. I wanted to put it off till next Saturday; and\r\nit rains because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me! So much the better, so\r\nmuch the better! I wish the sky would burst!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau tried to pacify her without success. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay\r\nfor her dress if it was spoilt! She had on a black silk dress in which\r\nshe was nearly choking, the bodice, too tight fitting, was almost\r\nbursting the button-holes, and was cutting her across the shoulders;\r\nwhile the skirt only allowed her to take very short steps in walking.\r\nHowever, the ladies present were all staring at her, quite overcome by\r\nher costume.\r\n\r\nShe appeared not to notice Gervaise, who was sitting beside mother\r\nCoupeau. She asked her husband for his handkerchief. Then she went into\r\na corner and very carefully wiped off the raindrops that had fallen on\r\nher silk dress.\r\n\r\nThe shower had abruptly ceased. The darkness increased, it was almost\r\nlike night\xe2\x80\x94a livid night rent at times by large flashes of lightning.\r\nBibi-the-Smoker said laughingly that it would certainly rain priests.\r\nThen the storm burst forth with extreme violence. For half an hour the\r\nrain came down in bucketsful, and the thunder rumbled unceasingly. The\r\nmen standing up before the door contemplated the grey veil of the\r\ndownpour, the swollen gutters, the splashes of water caused by the rain\r\nbeating into the puddles. The women, feeling frightened, had sat down\r\nagain, holding their hands before their eyes. They no longer conversed,\r\nthey were too upset. A jest Boche made about the thunder, saying that\r\nSt. Peter was sneezing up there, failed to raise a smile. But, when the\r\nthunder-claps became less frequent and gradually died away in the\r\ndistance, the wedding guests began to get impatient, enraged against\r\nthe storm, cursing and shaking their fists at the clouds. A fine and\r\ninterminable rain now poured down from the sky which had become an ashy\r\ngrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s past two o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t stop here\r\nfor ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Remanjou, having suggested going into the country all the\r\nsame, even though they went no farther than the moat of the\r\nfortifications, the others scouted the idea: the roads would be in a\r\nnice state, one would not even be able to sit down on the grass;\r\nbesides, it did not seem to be all over yet, there might perhaps be\r\nanother downpour. Coupeau, who had been watching a workman, completely\r\nsoaked, yet quietly walking along in the rain, murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that animal My-Boots is waiting for us on the Route de Saint-Denis,\r\nhe won\xe2\x80\x99t catch a sunstroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat made some of them laugh; but the general ill-humor increased. It\r\nwas becoming ludicrous. They must decide on something unless they\r\nplanned to sit there, staring at each other, until time for dinner. So\r\nfor the next quarter of an hour, while the persistent rain continued,\r\nthey tried to think of what to do. Bibi-the-Smoker suggested that they\r\nplay cards. Boche slyly suggesting a most amusing game, the game of\r\ntrue confessions. Madame Gaudron thought of going to eat onion tarts on\r\nthe Chaussee Clignancourt. Madame Lerat wanted to hear some stories.\r\nGaudron said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit put out and thought they were quite well\r\noff where they were, out of the downpour. He suggested sitting down to\r\ndinner immediately.\r\n\r\nThere was a discussion after each proposal. Some said that this would\r\nput everybody to sleep or that that would make people think they were\r\nstupid. Lorilleux had to get his word in. He finally suggested a walk\r\nalong the outer Boulevards to Pere Lachaise cemetery. They could visit\r\nthe tomb of Heloise and Abelard. Madame Lorilleux exploded, no longer\r\nable to control herself. She was leaving, she was. Were they trying to\r\nmake fun of her? She got all dressed up and came out in the rain. And\r\nfor what? To be wasting time in a wineshop. No, she had had enough of\r\nthis wedding party. She\xe2\x80\x99d rather be in her own home. Coupeau and\r\nLorilleux had to get between her and the door to keep her from leaving.\r\nShe kept telling them, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of my way! I am leaving, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLorilleux finally succeeded in calming her down. Coupeau went over to\r\nGervaise, who had been sitting quietly in a corner with mother Coupeau\r\nand Madame Fauconnier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t suggested anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Whatever they want,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. We can\r\ngo out or stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed aglow with contentment. She had spoken to each guest as they\r\narrived. She spoke sensibly, in her soft voice, not getting into any\r\ndisagreements. During the downpour, she had sat with her eyes wide\r\nopen, watching the lightning as though she could see the future in the\r\nsudden flashes.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier had up to this time not proposed anything. He was\r\nleaning against the bar, with the tails of his dress coat thrust apart,\r\nwhile he fully maintained the important air of an employer. He kept on\r\nexpectorating, and rolled his big eyes about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu_!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe might go to the Museum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he stroked his chin, as he blinkingly consulted the other members\r\nof the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are antiquities, pictures, paintings, a whole heap of things. It\r\nis very instructive. Perhaps you have never been there. Oh! it is quite\r\nworth seeing at least once in a while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other interrogatively. No, Gervaise had never been;\r\nMadame Fauconnier neither, nor Boche, nor the others. Coupeau thought\r\nhe had been one Sunday, but he was not sure. They hesitated, however,\r\nwhen Madame Lorilleux, greatly impressed by Monsieur Madinier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimportance, thought the suggestion a very worthy and respectable one.\r\nAs they were wasting the day, and were all dressed up, they might as\r\nwell go somewhere for their own instruction. Everyone approved. Then,\r\nas it still rained a little, they borrowed some umbrellas from the\r\nproprietor of the wineshop, old blue, green, and brown umbrellas,\r\nforgotten by different customers, and started off to the Museum.\r\n\r\nThe wedding party turned to the right, and descended into Paris along\r\nthe Faubourg Saint-Denis. Coupeau and Gervaise again took the lead,\r\nalmost running and keeping a good distance in front of the others.\r\nMonsieur Madinier now gave his arm to Madame Lorilleux, mother Coupeau\r\nhaving remained behind in the wineshop on account of her old legs. Then\r\ncame Lorilleux and Madame Lerat, Boche and Madame Fauconnier,\r\nBibi-the-Smoker and Mademoiselle Remanjou, and finally the two\r\nGaudrons. They were twelve and made a pretty long procession on the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you, we had nothing to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Lorilleux\r\nexplained to Monsieur Madinier. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how they met, or,\r\nwe know only too well, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to discuss. My husband\r\neven had to buy the wedding ring. We were scarcely out of bed this\r\nmorning when he had to lend them ten francs. And, not a member of her\r\nfamily at her wedding, what kind of bride is that? She says she has a\r\nsister in Paris who works for a pork butcher. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she invite\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped to point at Gervaise, who was limping awkwardly\r\nbecause of the slope of the pavement. \xe2\x80\x9cJust look at her. Clump-clump.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClump-clump\xe2\x80\x9d ran through the wedding procession. Lorilleux laughed\r\nunder his breath, and said they ought to call her that, but Madame\r\nFauconnier stood up for Gervaise. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of her; she\r\nwas neat as a pin and did a good job when there was washing to be done.\r\n\r\nWhen the wedding procession came out of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, they\r\nhad to cross the boulevard. The street had been transformed into a\r\nmorass of sticky mud by the storm. It had started to pour again and\r\nthey had opened the assorted umbrellas. The women picked their way\r\ncarefully through the mud, holding their skirts high as the men held\r\nthe sorry-looking umbrellas over their heads. The procession stretched\r\nout the width of the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a masquerade!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled two street urchins.\r\n\r\nPeople turned to stare. These couples parading across the boulevard\r\nadded a splash of vivid color against the damp background. It was a\r\nparade of a strange medley of styles showing fancy used clothing such\r\nas constitute the luxury of the poor. The gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s hats caused the\r\nmost merriment, old hats preserved for years in dark and dusty\r\ncupboards, in a variety of comical forms: tall ones, flattened ones,\r\nsharply peaked ones, hats with extraordinary brims, curled back or\r\nflat, too narrow or too wide. Then at the very end, Madame Gaudron came\r\nalong with her bright dress over her bulging belly and caused the\r\nsmiles of the audience to grow even wider. The procession made no\r\neffort to hasten its progress. They were, in fact, rather pleased to\r\nattract so much attention and admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Here comes the bride!\xe2\x80\x9d one of the urchins shouted, pointing to\r\nMadame Gaudron. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it too bad! She must have swallowed\r\nsomething!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe entire wedding procession burst into laughter. Bibi-the-Smoker\r\nturned around and laughed. Madame Gaudron laughed the most of all. She\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed as she thought more than one of the women watching had\r\nlooked at her with envy.\r\n\r\nThey turned into the Rue de Clery. Then they took the Rue du Mail. On\r\nreaching the Place des Victoires, there was a halt. The bride\xe2\x80\x99s left\r\nshoe lace had come undone, and as she tied it up again at the foot of\r\nthe statue of Louis XIV., the couples pressed behind her waiting, and\r\njoking about the bit of calf of her leg that she displayed. At length,\r\nafter passing down the Rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs, they reached the\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier politely asked to be their cicerone. It was a big\r\nplace, and they might lose themselves; besides, he knew the best parts,\r\nbecause he had often come there with an artist, a very intelligent\r\nfellow from whom a large dealer bought designs to put on his cardboard\r\nboxes. Down below, when the wedding party entered the Assyrian Museum,\r\na slight shiver passed through it. The deuce! It was not at all warm\r\nthere; the hall would have made a capital cellar. And the couples\r\nslowly advanced, their chins raised, their eyes blinking, between the\r\ngigantic stone figures, the black marble gods, dumb in their hieratic\r\nrigidity, and the monstrous beasts, half cats and half women, with\r\ndeath-like faces, attenuated noses, and swollen lips. They thought all\r\nthese things very ugly. The stone carvings of the present day were a\r\ngreat deal better. An inscription in Phoenician characters amazed them.\r\nNo one could possibly have ever read that scrawl. But Monsieur\r\nMadinier, already up on the first landing with Madame Lorilleux, called\r\nto them, shouting beneath the vaulted ceiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along! They\xe2\x80\x99re nothing, all those things! The things to see are\r\non the first floor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe severe barrenness of the staircase made them very grave. An\r\nattendant, superbly attired in a red waistcoat and a coat trimmed with\r\ngold lace, who seemed to be awaiting them on the landing, increased\r\ntheir emotion. It was with great respect, and treading as softly as\r\npossible, that they entered the French Gallery.\r\n\r\nThen, without stopping, their eyes occupied with the gilding of the\r\nframes, they followed the string of little rooms, glancing at the\r\npassing pictures too numerous to be seen properly. It would have\r\nrequired an hour before each, if they had wanted to understand it. What\r\na number of pictures! There was no end to them. They must be worth a\r\nmint of money. Right at the end, Monsieur Madinier suddenly ordered a\r\nhalt opposite the \xe2\x80\x9cRaft of the Medusa\xe2\x80\x9d and he explained the subject to\r\nthem. All deeply impressed and motionless, they uttered not a word.\r\nWhen they started off again, Boche expressed the general feeling,\r\nsaying it was marvellous.\r\n\r\nIn the Apollo Gallery, the inlaid flooring especially astonished the\r\nparty\xe2\x80\x94a shining floor, as clear as a mirror, and which reflected the\r\nlegs of the seats. Mademoiselle Remanjou kept her eyes closed, because\r\nshe could not help thinking that she was walking on water. They called\r\nto Madame Gaudron to be careful how she trod on account of her\r\ncondition. Monsieur Madinier wanted to show them the gilding and\r\npaintings of the ceiling; but it nearly broke their necks to look up\r\nabove, and they could distinguish nothing. Then, before entering the\r\nSquare Salon, he pointed to a window, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the balcony from which Charles IX. fired on the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked back to make sure the party was following. In the middle of\r\nthe Salon Carre, he held up his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are only masterpieces\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a subdued voice, as though in church. They went all\r\naround the room. Gervaise wanted to know about \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wedding at Cana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCoupeau paused to stare at the \xe2\x80\x9cMona Lisa,\xe2\x80\x9d saying that she reminded\r\nhim of one of his aunts. Boche and Bibi-the-Smoker snickered at the\r\nnudes, pointing them out to each other and winking. The Gaudrons looked\r\nat the \xe2\x80\x9cVirgin\xe2\x80\x9d of Murillo, he with his mouth open, she with her hands\r\nfolded on her belly.\r\n\r\nWhen they had been all around the Salon, Monsieur Madinier wished them\r\nto go round it again, it was so worth while. He was very attentive to\r\nMadame Lorilleux, because of her silk dress; and each time that she\r\nquestioned him he answered her gravely, with great assurance. She was\r\ncurious about \xe2\x80\x9cTitian\xe2\x80\x99s Mistress\xe2\x80\x9d because the yellow hair resembled her\r\nown. He told her it was \xe2\x80\x9cLa Belle Ferronniere,\xe2\x80\x9d a mistress of Henry IV.\r\nabout whom there had been a play at the Ambigu.\r\n\r\nThen the wedding party invaded the long gallery occupied by the Italian\r\nand Flemish schools. More paintings, always paintings, saints, men and\r\nwomen, with faces which some of them could understand, landscapes that\r\nwere all black, animals turned yellow, a medley of people and things,\r\nthe great mixture of the colors of which was beginning to give them all\r\nviolent headaches. Monsieur Madinier no longer talked as he slowly\r\nheaded the procession, which followed him in good order, with stretched\r\nnecks and upcast eyes. Centuries of art passed before their bewildered\r\nignorance, the fine sharpness of the early masters, the splendors of\r\nthe Venetians, the vigorous life, beautiful with light, of the Dutch\r\npainters. But what interested them most were the artists who were\r\ncopying, with their easels planted amongst the people, painting away\r\nunrestrainedly; an old lady, mounted on a pair of high steps, working a\r\nbig brush over the delicate sky of an immense painting, struck them as\r\nsomething most peculiar.\r\n\r\nSlowly the word must have gone around that a wedding party was visiting\r\nthe Louvre. Several painters came over with big smiles. Some visitors\r\nwere so curious that they went to sit on benches ahead of the group in\r\norder to be comfortable while they watched them pass in review. Museum\r\nguards bit back comments. The wedding party was now quite weary and\r\nbeginning to drag their feet.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier was reserving himself to give more effect to a\r\nsurprise that he had in store. He went straight to the \xe2\x80\x9cKermesse\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nRubens; but still he said nothing. He contented himself with directing\r\nthe others\xe2\x80\x99 attention to the picture by a sprightly glance. The ladies\r\nuttered faint cries the moment they brought their noses close to the\r\npainting. Then, blushing deeply they turned away their heads. The men\r\nthough kept them there, cracking jokes, and seeking for the coarser\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Boche, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s worth the money. There\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nspewing, and another, he\xe2\x80\x99s watering the dandelions; and that one\xe2\x80\x94oh!\r\nthat one. Ah, well! They\xe2\x80\x99re a nice clean lot, they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monsieur Madinier, delighted with his success.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to see here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey retraced their steps, passing again through the Salon Carre and\r\nthe Apollo Gallery. Madame Lerat and Mademoiselle Remanjou complained,\r\ndeclaring that their legs could scarcely bear them. But the cardboard\r\nbox manufacturer wanted to show Lorilleux the old jewelry. It was close\r\nby in a little room which he could find with his eyes shut. However, he\r\nmade a mistake and led the wedding party astray through seven or eight\r\ncold, deserted rooms, only ornamented with severe looking-glass cases,\r\ncontaining numberless broken pots and hideous little figures.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for an exit they stumbled into the collection of\r\ndrawings. It was immense. Through room after room they saw nothing\r\ninteresting, just scribblings on paper that filled all the cases and\r\ncovered the walls. They thought there was no end to these drawings.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier, losing his head, not willing to admit that he did\r\nnot know his way, ascended a flight of stairs, making the wedding party\r\nmount to the next floor. This time they traversed the Naval Museum,\r\namong models of instruments and cannons, plans in relief, and vessels\r\nas tiny as playthings. After going a long way, and walking for a\r\nquarter of an hour, the party came upon another staircase; and, having\r\ndescended this, found itself once more surrounded by the drawings. Then\r\ndespair took possession of them as they wandered at random through long\r\nhalls, following Monsieur Madinier, who was furious and mopping the\r\nsweat from his forehead. He accused the government of having moved the\r\ndoors around. Museum guards and visitors looked on with astonishment as\r\nthe procession, still in a column of couples, passed by. They passed\r\nagain through the Salon Carre, the French Gallery and then along the\r\ncases where minor Eastern divinities slumbered peacefully. It seemed\r\nthey would never find their way out. They were getting tired and made a\r\nlot of noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClosing time! Closing time!\xe2\x80\x9d called out the attendants, in a loud tone\r\nof voice.\r\n\r\nAnd the wedding party was nearly locked in. An attendant was obliged to\r\nplace himself at the head of it, and conduct it to a door. Then in the\r\ncourtyard of the Louvre, when it had recovered its umbrellas from the\r\ncloakroom, it breathed again. Monsieur Madinier regained his assurance.\r\nHe had made a mistake in not turning to the left, now he recollected\r\nthat the jewelry was to the left. The whole party pretended to be very\r\npleased at having seen all they had.\r\n\r\nFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock was striking. There were still two hours to be employed\r\nbefore the dinner time, so it was decided they should take a stroll,\r\njust to occupy the interval. The ladies, who were very tired, would\r\nhave preferred to sit down; but, as no one offered any refreshments,\r\nthey started off, following the line of quays. There they encountered\r\nanother shower and so sharp a one that in spite of the umbrellas, the\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 dresses began to get wet. Madame Lorilleux, her heart sinking\r\nwithin her each time a drop fell upon her black silk, proposed that\r\nthey should shelter themselves under the Pont-Royal; besides if the\r\nothers did not accompany her, she threatened to go all by herself. And\r\nthe procession marched under one of the arches of the bridge. They were\r\nvery comfortable there. It was, most decidedly a capital idea! The\r\nladies, spreading their handkerchiefs over the paving-stones, sat down\r\nwith their knees wide apart, and pulled out the blades of grass that\r\ngrew between the stones with both hands, whilst they watched the dark\r\nflowing water as though they were in the country. The men amused\r\nthemselves with calling out very loud, so as to awaken the echoes of\r\nthe arch. Boche and Bibi-the-Smoker shouted insults into the air at the\r\ntop of their voices, one after the other. They laughed uproariously\r\nwhen the echo threw the insults back at them. When their throats were\r\nhoarse from shouting, they made a game of skipping flat stones on the\r\nsurface of the Seine.\r\n\r\nThe shower had ceased but the whole party felt so comfortable that no\r\none thought of moving away. The Seine was flowing by, an oily sheet\r\ncarrying bottle corks, vegetable peelings, and other refuse that\r\nsometimes collected in temporary whirlpools moving along with the\r\nturbulent water. Endless traffic rumbled on the bridge overhead, the\r\nnoisy bustle of Paris, of which they could glimpse only the rooftops to\r\nthe left and right, as though they were in the bottom of a deep pit.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Remanjou sighed; if the leaves had been out this would\r\nhave reminded her of a bend of the Marne where she used to go with a\r\nyoung man. It still made her cry to think of him.\r\n\r\nAt last, Monsieur Madinier gave the signal for departure. They passed\r\nthrough the Tuileries gardens, in the midst of a little community of\r\nchildren, whose hoops and balls upset the good order of the couples.\r\nThen as the wedding party on arriving at the Place Vendome looked up at\r\nthe column, Monsieur Madinier gallantly offered to treat the ladies to\r\na view from the top. His suggestion was considered extremely amusing.\r\nYes, yes, they would go up; it would give them something to laugh about\r\nfor a long time. Besides, it would be full of interest for those\r\npersons who had never been higher than a cow pasture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think Clump-clump will venture inside there with her leg all\r\nout of place?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Lorilleux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go up with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lerat, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I won\xe2\x80\x99t have any\r\nmen walking behind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the whole party ascended. In the narrow space afforded by the\r\nspiral staircase, the twelve persons crawled up one after the other,\r\nstumbling against the worn steps, and clinging to the walls. Then, when\r\nthe obscurity became complete, they almost split their sides with\r\nlaughing. The ladies screamed when the gentlemen pinched their legs.\r\nBut they were weren\xe2\x80\x99t stupid enough to say anything! The proper plan is\r\nto think that it is the mice nibbling at them. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very serious;\r\nthe men knew when to stop.\r\n\r\nBoche thought of a joke and everyone took it up. They called down to\r\nMadame Gaudron to ask her if she could squeeze her belly through. Just\r\nthink! If she should get stuck there, she would completely block the\r\npassage, and how would they ever get out? They laughed so at the jokes\r\nabout her belly that the column itself vibrated. Boche was now quite\r\ncarried away and declared that they were growing old climbing up this\r\nchimney pipe. Was it ever coming to an end, or did it go right up to\r\nheaven? He tried to frighten the ladies by telling them the structure\r\nwas shaking.\r\n\r\nCoupeau, meanwhile, said nothing. He was behind Gervaise, with his arm\r\naround her waist, and felt that she was everything perfect to him. When\r\nthey suddenly emerged again into the daylight, he was just in the act\r\nof kissing her on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! You\xe2\x80\x99re a nice couple; you don\xe2\x80\x99t stand on ceremony,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame\r\nLorilleux with a scandalized air.\r\n\r\nBibi-the-Smoker pretended to be furious. He muttered between his teeth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made such a noise together! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even able to count the\r\nsteps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Monsieur Madinier was already up on the platform, pointing out the\r\ndifferent monuments. Neither Madame Fauconnier nor Mademoiselle\r\nRemanjou would on any consideration leave the staircase. The thought of\r\nthe pavement below made their blood curdle, and they contented\r\nthemselves with glancing out of the little door. Madame Lerat, who was\r\nbolder, went round the narrow terrace, keeping close to the bronze\r\ndome; but, _mon Dieu_, it gave one a rude emotion to think that one\r\nonly had to slip off. The men were a little paler than usual as they\r\nstared down at the square below. You would think you were up in\r\nmid-air, detached from everything. No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fun, it froze your\r\nvery insides.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier told them to raise their eyes and look straight into\r\nthe distance to avoid feeling dizzy. He went on pointing out the\r\nInvalides, the Pantheon, Notre Dame and the Montmartre hill. Madame\r\nLorilleux asked if they could see the place where they were to have\r\ndinner, the Silver Windmill on the Boulevard de la Chapelle. For ten\r\nminutes they tried to see it, even arguing about it. Everyone had their\r\nown idea where it was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth while coming up here to bite each other\xe2\x80\x99s noses off,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Boche, angrily as he turned to descend the staircase.\r\n\r\nThe wedding party went down, unspeaking and sulky, awakening no other\r\nsound beyond that of shoes clanking on the stone steps. When it reached\r\nthe bottom, Monsieur Madinier wished to pay; but Coupeau would not\r\npermit him, and hastened to place twenty-four sous into the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, two sous for each person. So they returned by the Boulevards and\r\nthe Faubourg du Poissonniers. Coupeau, however, considered that their\r\nouting could not end like that. He bundled them all into a wineshop\r\nwhere they took some vermouth.\r\n\r\nThe repast was ordered for six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. At the Silver Windmill, they\r\nhad been waiting for the wedding party for a good twenty minutes.\r\nMadame Boche, who had got a lady living in the same house to attend to\r\nher duties for the evening, was conversing with mother Coupeau in the\r\nfirst floor room, in front of the table, which was all laid out; and\r\nthe two youngsters, Claude and Etienne, whom she had brought with her,\r\nwere playing about beneath the table and amongst the chairs. When\r\nGervaise, on entering caught sight of the little ones, whom she had not\r\nseen all the day, she took them on her knees, and caressed and kissed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they been good?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she of Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope they haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworried you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as the latter related the things the little rascals had done during\r\nthe afternoon, and which would make one die with laughing, the mother\r\nagain took them up and pressed them to her breast, seized with an\r\noverpowering outburst of maternal affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not very pleasant for Coupeau, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Lorilleux\r\nwas saying to the other ladies, at the end of the room.\r\n\r\nGervaise had kept her smiling peacefulness from the morning, but after\r\nthe long walk she appeared almost sad at times as she watched her\r\nhusband and the Lorilleuxs in a thoughtful way. She had the feeling\r\nthat Coupeau was a little afraid of his sister. The evening before, he\r\nhad been talking big, swearing he would put them in their places if\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t behave. However, she could see that in their presence he\r\nwas hanging on their words, worrying when he thought they might be\r\ndispleased. This gave the young bride some cause for worry about the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThey were now only waiting for My-Boots, who had not yet put in an\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! blow him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s begin. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see, he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\nturn up, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a hollow nose, he can scent the grub from afar. I say\r\nhe must be amusing himself, if he\xe2\x80\x99s still standing like a post on the\r\nRoute de Saint-Denis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the wedding party, feeling very lively, sat down making a great\r\nnoise with the chairs. Gervaise was between Lorilleux and Monsieur\r\nMadinier, and Coupeau between Madame Fauconnier and Madame Lorilleux.\r\nThe other guests seated themselves where they liked, because it always\r\nended with jealousies and quarrels, when one settled their places for\r\nthem. Boche glided to a seat beside Madame Lerat. Bibi-the-Smoker had\r\nfor neighbors Mademoiselle Remanjou and Madame Gaudron. As for Madame\r\nBoche and mother Coupeau, they were right at the end of the table,\r\nlooking after the children, cutting up their meat and giving them\r\nsomething to drink, but not much wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes nobody say grace?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Boche, whilst the ladies arranged their\r\nskirts under the table-cloth, so as not to get them stained.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Lorilleux paid no attention to such pleasantries. The\r\nvermicelli soup, which was nearly cold, was gulped down very quickly,\r\ntheir lips making a hissing noise against the spoons. Two waiters\r\nserved at table, dressed in little greasy jackets and not over-clean\r\nwhite aprons. By the four open windows overlooking the acacias of the\r\ncourtyard there entered the clear light of the close of a stormy day,\r\nwith the atmosphere purified thereby though without sufficiently\r\ncooling it. The light reflected from the humid corner of trees tinged\r\nthe haze-filled room with green and made leaf shadows dance along the\r\ntable-cloth, from which came a vague aroma of dampness and mildew.\r\n\r\nTwo large mirrors, one at each end of the room, seemed to stretch out\r\nthe table. The heavy crockery with which it was set was beginning to\r\nturn yellow and the cutlery was scratched and grimed with grease. Each\r\ntime a waiter came through the swinging doors from the kitchen a whiff\r\nof odorous burnt lard came with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t all talk at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boche, as everyone remained silent with\r\nhis nose in his plate.\r\n\r\nThey were drinking the first glass of wine as their eyes followed two\r\nmeat pies which the waiters were handing round when My-Boots entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re a scurvy lot, you people!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wearing my\r\npins out for three hours waiting on that road, and a gendarme even came\r\nand asked me for my papers. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t right to play such dirty tricks on\r\na friend! You might at least have sent me word by a commissionaire. Ah!\r\nno, you know, joking apart, it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad. And with all that, it rained\r\nso hard that I got my pickets full of water. Honor bright, you might\r\nstill catch enough fish in \xe2\x80\x99em for a meal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others wriggled with laughter. That animal My-Boots was just a bit\r\non; he had certainly already stowed away his two quarts of wine, merely\r\nto prevent his being bothered by all that frog\xe2\x80\x99s liquor with which the\r\nstorm had deluged his limbs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! Count Leg-of-Mutton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9cjust go and sit yourself\r\nthere, beside Madame Gaudron. You see you were expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOh, he did not mind, he would soon catch the others up; and he asked\r\nfor three helpings of soup, platefuls of vermicelli, in which he soaked\r\nenormous slices of bread. Then, when they had attacked the meat pies,\r\nhe became the profound admiration of everyone at the table. How he\r\nstowed it away! The bewildered waiters helped each other to pass him\r\nbread, thin slices which he swallowed at a mouthful. He ended by losing\r\nhis temper; he insisted on having a loaf placed on the table beside\r\nhim. The landlord, very anxious, came for a moment and looked in at the\r\ndoor. The party, which was expecting him, again wriggled with laughter.\r\nIt seemed to upset the caterer. What a rum card he was that My-Boots!\r\nOne day he had eaten a dozen hard-boiled eggs and drank a dozen glasses\r\nof wine while the clock was striking twelve! There are not many who can\r\ndo that. And Mademoiselle Remanjou, deeply moved, watched My-Boots chew\r\nwhilst Monsieur Madinier, seeking for a word to express his almost\r\nrespectful astonishment, declared that such a capacity was\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence. A waiter had just placed on the table a\r\nragout of rabbits in a vast dish as deep as a salad-bowl. Coupeau, who\r\nliked fun, started another joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, waiter, that rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s from the housetops. It still mews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, a faint mew perfectly imitated seemed to issue from the\r\ndish. It was Coupeau who did that with his throat, without opening his\r\nlips; a talent which at all parties, met with decided success, so much\r\nso that he never ordered a dinner abroad without having a rabbit\r\nragout. After that he purred. The ladies pressed their napkins to their\r\nmouths to try and stop their laughter. Madame Fauconnier asked for a\r\nhead, she only liked that part. Mademoiselle Remanjou had a weakness\r\nfor the slices of bacon. And as Boche said he preferred the little\r\nonions when they were nicely broiled, Madame Lerat screwed up her lips,\r\nand murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a dried up stick, living the cloistered life of a hard-working\r\nwoman imprisoned within her daily routine, who had never had a man\r\nstick his nose into her room since the death of her husband; yet she\r\nhad an obsession with double meanings and indecent allusions that were\r\nsometimes so far off the mark that only she understood them.\r\n\r\nAs Boche leaned toward her and, in a whisper, asked for an explanation,\r\nshe resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle onions, why of course. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe general conversation was becoming grave. Each one was talking of\r\nhis trade. Monsieur Madinier raved about the cardboard business. There\r\nwere some real artists. For an example, he mentioned Christmas gift\r\nboxes, of which he\xe2\x80\x99d seen samples that were marvels of splendor.\r\n\r\nLorilleux sneered at this; he was extremely vain because of working\r\nwith gold, feeling that it gave a sort of sheen to his fingers and his\r\nwhole personality. \xe2\x80\x9cIn olden times jewelers wore swords like\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d He often cited the case of Bernard Palissy, even though he\r\nreally knew nothing about him.\r\n\r\nCoupeau told of a masterpiece of a weather vane made by one of his\r\nfellow workers which included a Greek column, a sheaf of wheat, a\r\nbasket of fruit, and a flag, all beautifully worked out of nothing but\r\nstrips of zinc shaped and soldered together.\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat showed Bibi-the-Smoker how to make a rose by rolling the\r\nhandle of her knife between her bony fingers.\r\n\r\nAll the while, their voices had been rising louder and louder,\r\ncompeting for attention. Shrill comments by Madame Fauconnier were\r\nheard. She complained about the girls who worked for her, especially a\r\nlittle apprentice who was nothing but a tart and had badly scorched\r\nsome sheets the evening before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may talk,\xe2\x80\x9d Lorilleux cried, banging his fist down on the table,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut gold is gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, in the midst of the silence caused by the statement of this fact,\r\nthe only sound heard was Mademoiselle Remanjou\xe2\x80\x99s shrill voice\r\ncontinuing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I turn up the skirt and stitch it inside. I stick a pin in the\r\nhead to keep the cap on, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all; and they are sold for thirteen\r\nsous a piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was explaining how she dressed her dolls to My-Boots, whose jaws\r\nwere working slowly like grindstones. He did not listen, though he kept\r\nnodding his head, but looked after the waiters to prevent them removing\r\nany of the dishes he had not cleaned out. They had now finished a veal\r\nstew with green beans. The roast was brought in, two scrawny chickens\r\nresting on a bed of water cress which was limp from the warming oven.\r\n\r\nOutside, only the higher branches of the acacias were touched by the\r\nsetting sun. Inside, the greenish reflected light was thickened by\r\nwisps of steam rising from the table, now messy with spilled wine and\r\ngravy and the debris of the dinner. Along the wall were dirty dishes\r\nand empty bottles which the waiters had piled there like a heap of\r\nrefuse. It was so hot that the men took off their jackets and continued\r\neating in their shirt sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Boche, please don\xe2\x80\x99t spread their butter so thick,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGervaise, who spoke but little, and who was watching Claude and Etienne\r\nfrom a distance.\r\n\r\nShe got up from her seat, and went and talked for a minute while\r\nstanding behind the little ones\xe2\x80\x99 chairs. Children did not reason; they\r\nwould eat all day long without refusing a single thing; and then she\r\nherself helped them to some chicken, a little of the breast. But mother\r\nCoupeau said they might, just for once in a while, risk an attack of\r\nindigestion. Madame Boche, in a low voice accused Boche of caressing\r\nMadame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s knees. Oh, he was a sly one, but he was getting a little\r\ntoo gay. She had certainly seen his hand disappear. If he did it again,\r\ndrat him! she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate throwing a pitcher of water over his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIn the partial silence, Monsieur Madinier was talking politics. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir\r\nlaw of May 31, is an abominable one. Now you must reside in a place for\r\ntwo years. Three millions of citizens are struck off the voting lists.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that Bonaparte is, in reality, very much annoyed for he\r\nloves the people; he has given them proofs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was a republican; but he admired the prince on account of his uncle,\r\na man the like of whom would never be seen again. Bibi-the-Smoker flew\r\ninto a passion. He had worked at the Elysee; he had seen Bonaparte just\r\nas he saw My-Boots in front of him over there. Well that muff of a\r\npresident was just like a jackass, that was all! It was said that he\r\nwas going to travel about in the direction of Lyons; it would be a\r\nprecious good riddance of bad rubbish if he fell into some hole and\r\nbroke his neck. But, as the discussion was becoming too heated, Coupeau\r\nhad to interfere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! How simple you all are to quarrel about politics. Politics\r\nare all humbug! Do such things exist for us? Let there be any one as\r\nking, it won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent me earning my five francs a day, and eating and\r\nsleeping; isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s too stupid to argue about!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLorilleux shook his head. He was born on the same day as the Count of\r\nChambord, the 29th of September, 1820. He was greatly struck with this\r\ncoincidence, indulging himself in a vague dream, in which he\r\nestablished a connection between the king\xe2\x80\x99s return to France and his\r\nown private fortunes. He never said exactly what he was expecting, but\r\nhe led people to suppose that when that time arrived something\r\nextraordinarily agreeable would happen to him. So whenever he had a\r\nwish too great to be gratified, he would put it off to another time,\r\nwhen the king came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d observed he, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the Count de Chambord one evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery face was turned towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite true. A stout man, in an overcoat, and with a good-natured\r\nair. I was at Pequignot\xe2\x80\x99s, one of my friends who deals in furniture in\r\nthe Grand Rue de la Chapelle. The Count of Chambord had forgotten his\r\numbrella there the day before; so he came in, and just simply said,\r\nlike this: \xe2\x80\x98Will you please return me my umbrella?\xe2\x80\x99 Well, yes, it was\r\nhim; Pequignot gave me his word of honor it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot one of the guests suggested the smallest doubt. They had now\r\narrived at dessert and the waiters were clearing the table with much\r\nclattering of dishes. Madame Lorilleux, who up to then had been very\r\ngenteel, very much the lady, suddenly let fly with a curse. One of the\r\nwaiters had spilled something wet down her neck while removing a dish.\r\nThis time her silk dress would be stained for sure. Monsieur Madinier\r\nhad to examine her back, but he swore there was nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\nTwo platters of cheese, two dishes of fruit, and a floating island\r\npudding of frosted eggs in a deep salad-bowl had now been placed along\r\nthe middle of the table. The pudding caused a moment of respectful\r\nattention even though the overdone egg whites had flattened on the\r\nyellow custard. It was unexpected and seemed very fancy.\r\n\r\nMy-Boots was still eating. He had asked for another loaf. He finished\r\nwhat there was of the cheese; and, as there was some cream left, he had\r\nthe salad-bowl passed to him, into which he sliced some large pieces of\r\nbread as though for a soup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman is really remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monsieur Madinier, again\r\ngiving way to his admiration.\r\n\r\nThen the men rose to get their pipes. They stood for a moment behind\r\nMy-Boots, patting him on the back, and asking him if he was feeling\r\nbetter. Bibi-the-Smoker lifted him up in his chair; but _tonnerre de\r\nDieu!_ the animal had doubled in weight. Coupeau joked that My-Boots\r\nwas only getting started, that now he was going to settle down and\r\nreally eat for the rest of the night. The waiters were startled and\r\nquickly vanished from sight.\r\n\r\nBoche, who had gone downstairs for a moment, came up to report the\r\nproprietor\xe2\x80\x99s reaction. He was standing behind his bar, pale as death.\r\nHis wife, dreadfully upset, was wondering if any bakeries were still\r\nopen. Even the cat seemed deep in despair. This was as funny as could\r\nbe, really worth the price of the dinner. It was impossible to have a\r\nproper dinner party without My-Boots, the bottomless pit. The other men\r\neyed him with a brooding jealousy as they puffed on their pipes.\r\nIndeed, to be able to eat so much, you had to be very solidly built!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care to be obliged to support you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Gaudron.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no; you may take my word for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, little mother, no jokes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied My-Boots, casting a side\r\nglance at his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s rotund figure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve swallowed more than I\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others applauded, shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it was well answered. It was\r\nnow pitch dark outside, three gas-jets were flaring in the room,\r\ndiffusing dim rays in the midst of the tobacco-smoke. The waiters,\r\nafter serving the coffee and the brandy, had removed the last piles of\r\ndirty plates. Down below, beneath the three acacias, dancing had\r\ncommenced, a cornet-a-piston and two fiddles playing very loud, and\r\nmingling in the warm night air with the rather hoarse laughter of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have a punch!\xe2\x80\x9d cried My-Boots; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo quarts of brandy, lots of\r\nlemon, and a little sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Coupeau, seeing the anxious look on Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s face in front of\r\nhim, got up from the table, declaring that there should be no more\r\ndrink. They had emptied twenty-five quarts, a quart and a half to each\r\nperson, counting the children as grown-up people; that was already too\r\nmuch. They had had a feed together in good fellowship, and without\r\nceremony, because they esteemed each other, and wished to celebrate the\r\nevent of the day amongst themselves. Everything had been very nice;\r\nthey had had lots of fun. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to get cockeyed drunk now, out\r\nof respect to the ladies. That was all he had to say, they had come\r\ntogether to toast a marriage and they had done so.\r\n\r\nCoupeau delivered the little speech with convincing sincerity and\r\npunctuated each phrase by placing his hand on his heart. He won\r\nwhole-hearted approval from Lorilleux and Monsieur Madinier; but the\r\nother four men, especially My-Boots, were already well lit and sneered.\r\nThey declared in hoarse drunken voices that they were thirsty and\r\nwanted drinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who\xe2\x80\x99re thirsty are thirsty, and those who aren\xe2\x80\x99t thirsty aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthirsty,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked My-Boots. \xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, we\xe2\x80\x99ll order the punch. No one\r\nneed take offence. The aristocrats can drink sugar-and-water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as the zinc-worker commenced another sermon, the other, who had\r\nrisen on his legs, gave himself a slap, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let\xe2\x80\x99s have no more of that, my boy! Waiter, two quarts of your\r\naged stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Coupeau said very well, only they would settle for the dinner at\r\nonce. It would prevent any disputes. The well-behaved people did not\r\nwant to pay for the drunkards; and it just happened that My-Boots,\r\nafter searching in his pockets for a long time, could only produce\r\nthree francs and seven sous. Well, why had they made him wait all that\r\ntime on the Route de Saint-Denis? He could not let himself be drowned\r\nand so he had broken into his five-franc piece. It was the fault of the\r\nothers, that was all! He ended by giving the three francs, keeping the\r\nseven sous for the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s tobacco. Coupeau, who was furious, would\r\nhave knocked him over had not Gervaise, greatly frightened, pulled him\r\nby his coat, and begged him to keep cool. He decided to borrow the two\r\nfrancs of Lorilleux, who after refusing them, lent them on the sly, for\r\nhis wife would never have consented to his doing so.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier went round with a plate. The spinster and the ladies\r\nwho were alone\xe2\x80\x94Madame Lerat, Madame Fauconnier, Mademoiselle\r\nRemanjou\xe2\x80\x94discreetly placed their five-franc pieces in it first. Then\r\nthe gentlemen went to the other end of the room, and made up the\r\naccounts. They were fifteen; it amounted therefore to seventy-five\r\nfrancs. When the seventy-five francs were in the plate, each man added\r\nfive sous for the waiters. It took a quarter of an hour of laborious\r\ncalculations before everything was settled to the general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut when Monsieur Madinier, who wished to deal direct with the\r\nlandlord, had got him to step up, the whole party became lost in\r\nastonishment on hearing him say with a smile that there was still\r\nsomething due to him. There were some extras; and, as the word \xe2\x80\x9cextras\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas greeted with angry exclamations, he entered into\r\ndetails:\xe2\x80\x94Twenty-five quarts of wine, instead of twenty, the number\r\nagreed upon beforehand; the frosted eggs, which he had added, as the\r\ndessert was rather scanty; finally, a quarter of a bottle of rum,\r\nserved with the coffee, in case any one preferred rum. Then a\r\nformidable quarrel ensued. Coupeau, who was appealed to, protested\r\nagainst everything; he had never mentioned twenty quarts; as for the\r\nfrosted eggs, they were included in the dessert, so much the worse for\r\nthe landlord if he choose to add them without being asked to do so.\r\nThere remained the rum, a mere nothing, just a mode of increasing the\r\nbill by putting on the table spirits that no one thought anything\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was on the tray with the coffee,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9ctherefore it goes with\r\nthe coffee. Go to the deuce! Take your money, and never again will we\r\nset foot in your den!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s six francs more,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cPay me my six francs;\r\nand with all that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t counted the four loaves that gentleman\r\nate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole party, pressing forward, surrounded him with furious gestures\r\nand a yelping of voices choking with rage. The women especially threw\r\naside all reserve, and refused to add another centime. This was some\r\nwedding dinner! Mademoiselle Remanjou vowed she would never again\r\nattend such a party. Madame Fauconnier declared she had had a very\r\ndisappointing meal; at home she could have had a finger-licking dish\r\nfor only two francs. Madame Gaudron bitterly complained that she had\r\nbeen shoved down to the worst end of the table next to My-Boots who had\r\nignored her. These parties never turned out well, one should be more\r\ncareful whom one invites. Gervaise had taken refuge with mother Coupeau\r\nnear one of the windows, feeling shamed as she realized that all these\r\nrecriminations would fall back upon her.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Madinier ended by going down with the landlord. One could hear\r\nthem arguing below. Then, when half an hour had gone by the cardboard\r\nbox manufacturer returned; he had settled the matter by giving three\r\nfrancs. But the party continued annoyed and exasperated, constantly\r\nreturning to the question of the extras. And the uproar increased from\r\nan act of vigor on Madame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s part. She had kept an eye on Boche,\r\nand at length detected him squeezing Madame Lerat round the waist in a\r\ncorner. Then, with all her strength, she flung a water pitcher, which\r\nsmashed against the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can easily see that your husband\xe2\x80\x99s a tailor, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ntall widow, with a curl of the lip, full of a double meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npetticoat specialist, even though I gave him some pretty hard kicks\r\nunder the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe harmony of the evening was altogether upset. Everyone became more\r\nand more ill-tempered. Monsieur Madinier suggested some singing, but\r\nBibi-the-Smoker, who had a fine voice, had disappeared some time\r\nbefore; and Mademoiselle Remanjou, who was leaning out of the window,\r\ncaught sight of him under the acacias, swinging round a big girl who\r\nwas bare-headed. The cornet-a-piston and two fiddles were playing \xe2\x80\x9c_Le\r\nMarchand de Moutarde_.\xe2\x80\x9d The party now began to break up. My-Boots and\r\nthe Gaudrons went down to the dance with Boche sneaking along after\r\nthem. The twirling couples could be seen from the windows. The night\r\nwas still as though exhausted from the heat of the day. A serious\r\nconversation started between Lorilleux and Monsieur Madinier. The\r\nladies examined their dresses carefully to see if they had been\r\nstained.\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s fringe looked as though it had been dipped in the\r\ncoffee. Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s chintz dress was spotted with gravy. Mother\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s green shawl, fallen from off a chair, was discovered in a\r\ncorner, rolled up and trodden upon. But it was Madame Lorilleux\r\nespecially who became more ill-tempered still. She had a stain on the\r\nback of her dress; it was useless for the others to declare that she\r\nhad not\xe2\x80\x94she felt it. And, by twisting herself about in front of a\r\nlooking-glass, she ended by catching a glimpse of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I say?\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gravy from the fowl. The waiter\r\nshall pay for the dress. I will bring an action against him. Ah! this\r\nis a fit ending to such a day. I should have done better to have stayed\r\nin bed. To begin with, I\xe2\x80\x99m off. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of their wretched\r\nwedding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she left the room in a rage, causing the staircase to shake beneath\r\nher heavy footsteps. Lorilleux ran after her. But all she would consent\r\nto was that she would wait five minutes on the pavement outside, if he\r\nwanted them to go off together. She ought to have left directly after\r\nthe storm, as she wished to do. She would make Coupeau sorry for that\r\nday. Coupeau was dismayed when he heard how angry she was. Gervaise\r\nagreed to leave at once to avoid embarrassing him any more.\r\n\r\nThere was a flurry of quick good-night kisses. Monsieur Madinier was to\r\nescort mother Coupeau home. Madame Boche would take Claude and Etienne\r\nwith her for the bridal night. The children were sound asleep on\r\nchairs, stuffed full from the dinner. Just as the bridal couple and\r\nLorilleux were about to go out the door, a quarrel broke out near the\r\ndance floor between their group and another group. Boche and My-Boots\r\nwere kissing a lady and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give her up to her escorts, two\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. On the Boulevard de la Chapelle, and in\r\nthe entire neighborhood of the Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, the fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s pay, which\r\nfell due on that Saturday, produced an enormous drunken uproar. Madame\r\nLorilleux was waiting beneath a gas-lamp about twenty paces from the\r\nSilver Windmill. She took her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and walked on in front\r\nwithout looking round, at such a rate, that Gervaise and Coupeau got\r\nquite out of breath in trying to keep up with them. Now and again they\r\nstepped off the pavement to leave room for some drunkard who had fallen\r\nthere. Lorilleux looked back, endeavoring to make things pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see you as far as your door,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Lorilleux, raising her voice, thought it a funny thing to\r\nspend one\xe2\x80\x99s wedding night in such a filthy hole as the Hotel Boncoeur.\r\nOught they not to have put their marriage off, and have saved a few\r\nsous to buy some furniture, so as to have had a home of their own on\r\nthe first night? Ah! they would be comfortable, right up under the\r\nroof, packed into a little closet, at ten francs a month, where there\r\nwas not even the slightest air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve given notice, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to use the room up at the top of\r\nthe house,\xe2\x80\x9d timidly interposed Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are keeping Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, which is larger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux forgot herself. She turned abruptly round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s worse than all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to sleep in\r\nClump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise became quite pale. This nickname, which she received full in\r\nthe face for the first time, fell on her like a blow. And she fully\r\nunderstood it, too, her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation: the Clump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom was the room in which she had lived for a month with Lantier,\r\nwhere the shreds of her past life still hung about. Coupeau did not\r\nunderstand this, but merely felt hurt at the harsh nickname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do wrong to christen others,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nperhaps, that in the neighborhood they call you Cow\xe2\x80\x99s-Tail, because of\r\nyour hair. There, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t please you, does it? Why should we not\r\nkeep the room on the first floor? To-night the children won\xe2\x80\x99t sleep\r\nthere, and we shall be very comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux added nothing further, but retired into her dignity,\r\nhorribly annoyed at being called Cow\xe2\x80\x99s-Tail. To cheer up Gervaise,\r\nCoupeau squeezed her arm softly. He even succeeded in making her smile\r\nby whispering into her ear that they were setting up housekeeping with\r\nthe grand sum of seven sous, three big two-sou pieces and one little\r\nsou, which he jingled in his pocket.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Hotel Boncoeur, the two couples wished each other\r\ngood-night, with an angry air; and as Coupeau pushed the two women into\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, calling them a couple of ninnies, a drunken fellow,\r\nwho seemed to want to go to the right, suddenly slipped to the left and\r\ncame tumbling between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s old Bazouge!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had his fill to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, frightened, squeezed up against the door of the hotel. Old\r\nBazouge, an undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helper of some fifty years of age, had his\r\nblack trousers all stained with mud, his black cape hooked on to his\r\nshoulder, and his black feather hat knocked in by some tumble he had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, he\xe2\x80\x99s harmless,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a neighbor\r\nof ours\xe2\x80\x94the third room in the passage before us. He would find himself\r\nin a nice mess if his people were to see him like this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Bazouge, however, felt offended at the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s evident\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what!\xe2\x80\x9d hiccoughed he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to eat any one. I\xe2\x80\x99m as\r\ngood as another any day, my little woman. No doubt I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a drop!\r\nWhen work\xe2\x80\x99s plentiful one must grease the wheels. It\xe2\x80\x99s not you, nor\r\nyour friends, who would have carried down the stiff \xe2\x80\x99un of forty-seven\r\nstone whom I and a pal brought from the fourth floor to the pavement,\r\nand without smashing him too. I like jolly people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Gervaise retreated further into the doorway, seized with a longing\r\nto cry, which spoilt her day of sober-minded joy. She no longer thought\r\nof kissing her sister-in-law, she implored Coupeau to get rid of the\r\ndrunkard. Then Bazouge, as he stumbled about, made a gesture of\r\nphilosophical disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent you passing though our hands, my little woman.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll perhaps be glad to do so, one of these days. Yes, I know some\r\nwomen who\xe2\x80\x99d be much obliged if we did carry them off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, as Lorilleux led him away, he turned around, and stuttered out a\r\nlast sentence, between two hiccoughs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re dead\xe2\x80\x94listen to this\xe2\x80\x94when you\xe2\x80\x99re dead, it\xe2\x80\x99s for a long,\r\nlong time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen followed four years of hard work. In the neighborhood, Gervaise\r\nand Coupeau had the reputation of being a happy couple, living in\r\nretirement without quarrels, and taking a short walk regularly every\r\nSunday in the direction of St. Ouen. The wife worked twelve hours a day\r\nat Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s, and still found means to keep their lodging as\r\nclean and bright as a new coined sou and to prepare the meals for all\r\nher little family, morning and evening. The husband never got drunk,\r\nbrought his wages home every fortnight, and smoked a pipe at his window\r\nin the evening, to get a breath of fresh air before going to bed. They\r\nwere frequently alluded to on account of their nice, pleasant ways; and\r\nas between them they earned close upon nine francs a day, it was\r\nreckoned that they were able to put by a good deal of money.\r\n\r\nHowever, during their first months together they had to struggle hard\r\nto get by. Their wedding had left them owing two hundred francs. Also,\r\nthey detested the Hotel Boncoeur as they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the other\r\noccupants. Their dream was to have a home of their own with their own\r\nfurniture. They were always figuring how much they would need and\r\ndecided three hundred and fifty francs at least, in order to be able to\r\nbuy little items that came up later.\r\n\r\nThey were in despair at ever being able to collect such a large sum\r\nwhen a lucky chance came their way. An old gentleman at Plassans\r\noffered to take the older boy, Claude, and send him to an academy down\r\nthere. The old man, who loved art, had previously been much impressed\r\nby Claude\xe2\x80\x99s sketches. Claude had already begun to cost them quite a\r\nbit. Now, with only Etienne to support, they were able to accumulate\r\nthe money in a little over seven months. One day they were finally able\r\nto buy their own furniture from a second-hand dealer on Rue Belhomme.\r\nTheir hearts filled with happiness, they celebrated by walking home\r\nalong the exterior Boulevards.\r\n\r\nThey had purchased a bed, a night table, a chest of drawers with a\r\nmarble top, a wardrobe, a round table covered with oilcloth, and six\r\nchairs. All were of dark mahogany. They also bought blankets, linen,\r\nand kitchen utensils that were scarcely used. It meant settling down\r\nand giving themselves a status in life as property owners, as persons\r\nto be respected.\r\n\r\nFor two months past they had been busy seeking some new apartments. At\r\nfirst they wanted above everything to hire these in the big house of\r\nthe Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. But there was not a single room to let\r\nthere; so that they had to relinquish their old dream. To tell the\r\ntruth, Gervaise was rather glad in her heart; the neighborhood of the\r\nLorilleux almost door to door, frightened her immensely. Then, they\r\nlooked about elsewhere. Coupeau, very properly did not wish to be far\r\nfrom Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s so that Gervaise could easily run home at any\r\nhour of the day. And at length they met with exactly what suited them,\r\na large room with a small closet and a kitchen, in the Rue Neuve de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, almost opposite the laundress\xe2\x80\x99s. This was in a small\r\ntwo-story building with a very steep staircase. There were two\r\napartments on the second floor, one to the left, the other to the\r\nright, The ground floor was occupied by a man who rented out carriages,\r\nwhich filled the sheds in the large stable yard by the street.\r\n\r\nGervaise was delighted with this as it made her feel she was back in a\r\ncountry town. With no close neighbors there would be no gossip to worry\r\nabout in this little corner. It reminded her of a small lane outside\r\nthe ramparts of Plassans. She could even see her own window while\r\nironing at the laundry by just tilting her head to the side.\r\n\r\nThey took possession of their new abode at the April quarter. Gervaise\r\nwas then eight months advanced. But she showed great courage, saying\r\nwith a laugh that the baby helped her as she worked; she felt its\r\ninfluence growing within her and giving her strength. Ah, well! She\r\njust laughed at Coupeau whenever he wanted her to lie down and rest\r\nherself! She would take to her bed when the labor pains came. That\r\nwould be quite soon enough as with another mouth to feed, they would\r\nhave to work harder than ever.\r\n\r\nShe made their new place bright and shiny before helping her husband\r\ninstall the furniture. She loved the furniture, polishing it and\r\nbecoming almost heart-broken at the slightest scratch. Any time she\r\nknocked into the furniture while cleaning she would stop with a sudden\r\nshock as though she had hurt herself.\r\n\r\nThe chest of drawers was especially dear to her. She thought it\r\nhandsome, sturdy and most respectable-looking. The dream that she\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t dared to mention was to get a clock and put it right in the\r\nmiddle of the marble top. It would make a splendid effect. She probably\r\nwould have bought one right away except for the expected baby.\r\n\r\nThe couple were thoroughly enchanted with their new home. Etienne\xe2\x80\x99s bed\r\noccupied the small closet, where there was still room to put another\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s crib. The kitchen was a very tiny affair and as dark as night,\r\nbut by leaving the door wide open, one could just manage to see;\r\nbesides, Gervaise had not to cook meals for thirty people, all she\r\nwanted was room to make her soup. As for the large room, it was their\r\npride. The first thing in the morning, they drew the curtains of the\r\nalcove, white calico curtains; and the room was thus transformed into a\r\ndining-room, with the table in the centre, and the wardrobe and chest\r\nof drawers facing each other.\r\n\r\nThey stopped up the chimney since it burned as much as fifteen sous of\r\ncoal a day. A small cast-iron stove on the marble hearth gave them\r\nenough warmth on cold days for only seven sous. Coupeau had also done\r\nhis best to decorate the walls. There was a large engraving showing a\r\nmarshal of France on horseback with a baton in his hand. Family\r\nphotographs were arranged in two rows on top of the chest of drawers on\r\neach side of an old holy-water basin in which they kept matches. Busts\r\nof Pascal and Beranger were on top of the wardrobe. It was really a\r\nhandsome room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess how much we pay here?\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise would ask of every visitor she\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nAnd whenever they guessed too high a sum, she triumphed and delighted\r\nat being so well suited for such a little money, cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and fifty francs, not a sou more! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it almost like\r\nhaving it for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe street, Rue Neuve de la Goutte d\xe2\x80\x99Or, played an important part in\r\ntheir contentment. Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s whole life was there, as she traveled\r\nback and forth endlessly between her home and Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaundry. Coupeau now went down every evening and stood on the doorstep\r\nto smoke his pipe. The poorly-paved street rose steeply and had no\r\nsidewalks. Toward Rue de la Goutte d\xe2\x80\x99Or there were some gloomy shops\r\nwith dirty windows. There were shoemakers, coopers, a run-down grocery,\r\nand a bankrupt cafe whose closed shutters were covered with posters. In\r\nthe opposite direction, toward Paris, four-story buildings blocked the\r\nsky. Their ground floor shops were all occupied by laundries with one\r\nexception\xe2\x80\x94a green-painted store front typical of a small-town\r\nhair-dresser. Its shop windows were full of variously colored flasks.\r\nIt lighted up this drab corner with the gay brightness of its copper\r\nbowls which were always shining.\r\n\r\nThe most pleasant part of the street was in between, where the\r\nbuildings were fewer and lower, letting in more sunlight. The carriage\r\nsheds, the plant which manufactured soda water, and the wash-house\r\nopposite made a wide expanse of quietness. The muffled voices of the\r\nwasherwomen and the rhythmic puffing of the steam engine seemed to\r\ndeepen the almost religious silence. Open fields and narrow lanes\r\nvanishing between dark walls gave it the air of a country village.\r\nCoupeau, always amused by the infrequent pedestrians having to jump\r\nover the continuous streams of soapy water, said it reminded him of a\r\ncountry town where his uncle had taken him when he was five years old.\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s greatest joy was a tree growing in the courtyard to the left\r\nof their window, an acacia that stretched out a single branch and yet,\r\nwith its meager foliage, lent charm to the entire street.\r\n\r\nIt was on the last day of April that Gervaise was confined. The pains\r\ncame on in the afternoon, towards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as she was ironing a\r\npair of curtains at Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s. She would not go home at once,\r\nbut remained there wriggling about on a chair, and continuing her\r\nironing every time the pain allowed her to do so; the curtains were\r\nwanted quickly and she obstinately made a point of finishing them.\r\nBesides, perhaps after all it was only a colic; it would never do to be\r\nfrightened by a bit of a stomach-ache. But as she was talking of\r\nstarting on some shirts, she became quite pale. She was obliged to\r\nleave the work-shop, and cross the street doubled in two, holding on to\r\nthe walls. One of the workwomen offered to accompany her; she declined,\r\nbut begged her to go instead for the midwife, close by, in the Rue de\r\nla Charbonniere. This was only a false alarm; there was no need to make\r\na fuss. She would be like that no doubt all through the night. It was\r\nnot going to prevent her getting Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s dinner ready as soon as she\r\nwas indoors; then she might perhaps lie down on the bed a little, but\r\nwithout undressing. On the staircase she was seized with such a violent\r\npain, that she was obliged to sit down on one of the stairs; and she\r\npressed her two fists against her mouth to prevent herself from crying\r\nout, for she would have been ashamed to have been found there by any\r\nman, had one come up. The pain passed away; she was able to open her\r\ndoor, feeling relieved, and thinking that she had decidedly been\r\nmistaken. That evening she was going to make a stew with some neck\r\nchops. All went well while she peeled the potatoes. The chops were\r\ncooking in a saucepan when the pains returned. She mixed the gravy as\r\nshe stamped about in front of the stove, almost blinded with her tears.\r\nIf she was going to give birth, that was no reason why Coupeau should\r\nbe kept without his dinner. At length the stew began to simmer on a\r\nfire covered with cinders. She went into the other room, and thought\r\nshe would have time to lay the cloth at one end of the table. But she\r\nwas obliged to put down the bottle of wine very quickly; she no longer\r\nhad strength to reach the bed; she fell prostrate, and she had more\r\npains on a mat on the floor. When the midwife arrived, a quarter of an\r\nhour later, she found mother and baby lying there on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe zinc-worker was still employed at the hospital. Gervaise would not\r\nhave him disturbed. When he came home at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he found her in\r\nbed, well covered up, looking very pale on the pillow, and the child\r\ncrying, swathed in a shawl at its mother\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my poor wife!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, kissing Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was joking\r\nonly an hour ago, whilst you were crying with pain! I say, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake much fuss about it\xe2\x80\x94the time to sneeze and it\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly; then she murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d the zinc-worker replied, joking so as to enliven her, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nordered a girl! Well, now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got what I wanted! You do everything I\r\nwish!\xe2\x80\x9d And, taking the child up in his arms, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s have\r\na look at you, miss! You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very black little mug. It\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nwhiter, never fear. You must be good, never run about the streets, and\r\ngrow up sensible like your papa and mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise looked at her daughter very seriously, with wide open eyes,\r\nslowly overshadowed with sadness, for she would rather have had a boy.\r\nBoys can talk care of themselves and don\xe2\x80\x99t have to run such risks on\r\nthe streets of Paris as girls do. The midwife took the infant from\r\nCoupeau. She forbade Gervaise to do any talking; it was bad enough\r\nthere was so much noise around her.\r\n\r\nThen the zinc-worker said that he must tell the news to mother Coupeau\r\nand the Lorilleuxs, but he was dying with hunger, he must first of all\r\nhave his dinner. It was a great worry to the invalid to see him have to\r\nwait on himself, run to the kitchen for the stew, eat it out of a soup\r\nplate, and not be able to find the bread. In spite of being told not to\r\ndo so, she bewailed her condition, and fidgeted about in her bed. It\r\nwas stupid of her not to have managed to set the cloth, the pains had\r\nlaid her on her back like a blow from a bludgeon. Her poor old man\r\nwould not think it kind of her to be nursing herself up there whilst he\r\nwas dining so badly. At least were the potatoes cooked enough? She no\r\nlonger remembered whether she had put salt in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the midwife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if only you could stop her from wearing herself out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau\r\nwith his mouth full. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were not here, I\xe2\x80\x99d bet she\xe2\x80\x99d get up to cut\r\nmy bread. Keep on your back, you big goose! You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t move about,\r\notherwise it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a fortnight before you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to stand on your\r\nlegs. Your stew\xe2\x80\x99s very good. Madame will eat some with me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nMadame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe midwife declined; but she was willing to accept a glass of wine,\r\nbecause it had upset her, said she to find the poor woman with the baby\r\non the mat. Coupeau at length went off to tell the news to his\r\nrelations. Half an hour later he returned with all of them, mother\r\nCoupeau, the Lorilleuxs, and Madame Lerat, whom he had met at the\r\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you the whole gang!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped!\r\nThey wanted to see you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t open your mouth, it\xe2\x80\x99s forbidden. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nstop here and look at you without ceremony, you know. As for me, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to make them some coffee, and of the right sort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into the kitchen. Mother Coupeau after kissing Gervaise,\r\nbecame amazed at the child\xe2\x80\x99s size. The two other women also kissed the\r\ninvalid on her cheeks. And all three, standing before the bed,\r\ncommented with divers exclamations on the details of the confinement\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmost remarkable confinement, just like having a tooth pulled, nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat examined the baby all over, declared she was well formed,\r\neven added that she could grow up into an attractive woman. Noticing\r\nthat the head had been squeezed into a point on top, she kneaded it\r\ngently despite the infant\xe2\x80\x99s cries, trying to round it a bit. Madame\r\nLorilleux grabbed the baby from her; that could be enough to give the\r\npoor little thing all sorts of vicious tendencies, meddling with it\r\nlike that while her skull was still soft. She then tried to figure out\r\nwho the baby resembled. This almost led to a quarrel. Lorilleux,\r\npeering over the women\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, insisted that the little girl\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t look the least bit like Coupeau. Well, maybe a little around the\r\nnose, nothing more. She was her mother all over again, with big eyes\r\nlike hers. Certainly there were no eyes like that in the Coupeau\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nCoupeau, however, had failed to reappear. One could hear him in the\r\nkitchen struggling with the grate and the coffee-pot. Gervaise was\r\nworrying herself frightfully; it was not the proper thing for a man to\r\nmake coffee; and she called and told him what to do, without listening\r\nto the midwife\xe2\x80\x99s energetic \xe2\x80\x9chush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, entering with the coffee-pot in his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I just have a bother with it! It all went wrong on purpose! Now\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll drink out of glasses, won\xe2\x80\x99t we? Because you know, the cups are\r\nstill at the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves around the table, and the zinc-worker insisted\r\non pouring out the coffee himself. It smelt very strong, it was none of\r\nthat weak stuff. When the midwife had sipped hers up, she went off;\r\neverything was going on nicely, she was not required. If the young\r\nwoman did not pass a good night they were to send for her on the\r\nmorrow. She was scarcely down the staircase, when Madame Lorilleux\r\ncalled her a glutton and a good-for-nothing. She put four lumps of\r\nsugar in her coffee, and charged fifteen francs for leaving you with\r\nyour baby all by yourself. But Coupeau took her part; he would\r\nwillingly fork out the fifteen francs. After all those sort of women\r\nspent their youth in studying, they were right to charge a good price.\r\n\r\nIt was then Lorilleux who got into a quarrel with Madame Lerat by\r\nmaintaining that, in order to have a son, the head of the bed should be\r\nturned to the north. She shrugged her shoulders at such nonsense,\r\noffering another formula which consisted in hiding under the mattress,\r\nwithout letting your wife know, a handful of fresh nettles picked in\r\nbright sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe table had been pushed over close to the bed. Until ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nGervaise lay there, smiling although she was only half awake. She was\r\nbecoming more and more weary, her head turned sideways on the pillow.\r\nShe no longer had the energy to venture a remark or a gesture. It\r\nseemed to her that she was dead, a very sweet death, from the depths of\r\nwhich she was happy to observe the others still in the land of the\r\nliving. The thin cries of her baby daughter rose above the hum of heavy\r\nvoices that were discussing a recent murder on Rue du Bon Puits, at the\r\nother end of La Chapelle.\r\n\r\nThen, as the visitors were thinking of leaving, they spoke of the\r\nchristening. The Lorilleux had promised to be godfather and godmother;\r\nthey looked very glum over the matter. However, if they had not been\r\nasked to stand they would have felt rather peculiar. Coupeau did not\r\nsee any need for christening the little one; it certainly would not\r\nprocure her an income of ten thousand francs, and besides she might\r\ncatch a cold from it. The less one had to do with priests the better.\r\nBut mother Coupeau called him a heathen. The Lorilleux, without going\r\nand eating consecrated bread in church, plumed themselves on their\r\nreligious sentiments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be next Sunday, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chainmaker.\r\n\r\nAnd Gervaise having consented by a nod, everyone kissed her and told\r\nher to take good care of herself. They also wished the baby good-bye.\r\nEach one went and leant over the little trembling body with smiles and\r\nloving words as though she were able to understand. They called her\r\nNana, the pet name for Anna, which was her godmother\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, Nana. Come be a good girl, Nana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen they had at length gone off, Coupeau drew his chair close up to\r\nthe bed and finished his pipe, holding Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his. He\r\nsmoked slowly, deeply affected and uttering sentences between the\r\npuffs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old woman, they\xe2\x80\x99ve made your head ache, haven\xe2\x80\x99t they? You see I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent them coming. After all, it shows their friendship. But\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re better alone, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we? I wanted to be alone like this with you.\r\nIt has seemed such a long evening to me! Poor little thing, she\xe2\x80\x99s had a\r\nlot to go through! Those shrimps, when they come out into the world,\r\nhave no idea of the pain they cause. It must really almost be like\r\nbeing split in two. Where does it hurt the most, that I may kiss it and\r\nmake it well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had carefully slid one of his big hands under her back, and now he\r\ndrew her toward him, bending over to kiss her stomach through the\r\ncovers, touched by a rough man\xe2\x80\x99s compassion for the suffering of a\r\nwoman in childbirth. He inquired if he was hurting her. Gervaise felt\r\nvery happy, and answered him that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt any more at all. She\r\nwas only worried about getting up as soon as possible, because there\r\nwas no time to lie about now. He assured her that he\xe2\x80\x99d be responsible\r\nfor earning the money for the new little one. He would be a real bum if\r\nhe abandoned her and the little rascal. The way he figured it, what\r\nreally counted was bringing her up properly. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\r\n\r\nCoupeau did not sleep much that night. He covered up the fire in the\r\nstove. Every hour he had to get up to give the baby spoonfuls of\r\nlukewarm sugar and water. That did not prevent his going off to his\r\nwork in the morning as usual. He even took advantage of his lunch-hour\r\nto make a declaration of the birth at the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s. During this time\r\nMadame Boche, who had been informed of the event, had hastened to go\r\nand pass the day with Gervaise. But the latter, after ten hours of\r\nsleep, bewailed her position, saying that she already felt pains all\r\nover her through having been so long in bed. She would become quite ill\r\nif they did not let her get up. In the evening, when Coupeau returned\r\nhome, she told him all her worries; no doubt she had confidence in\r\nMadame Boche, only it put her beside herself to see a stranger\r\ninstalled in her room, opening the drawers, and touching her things.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the concierge, on returning from some errand, found her\r\nup, dressed, sweeping and getting her husband\xe2\x80\x99s dinner ready; and it\r\nwas impossible to persuade her to go to bed again. They were trying to\r\nmake a fool of her perhaps! It was all very well for ladies to pretend\r\nto be unable to move. When one was not rich one had no time for that\r\nsort of thing. Three days after her confinement she was ironing\r\npetticoats at Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s, banging her irons and all in a\r\nperspiration from the great heat of the stove.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday evening, Madame Lorilleux brought her presents for her\r\ngodchild\xe2\x80\x94a cup that cost thirty-five sous, and a christening dress,\r\nplaited and trimmed with some cheap lace, which she had got for six\r\nfrancs, because it was slightly soiled. On the morrow, Lorilleux, as\r\ngodfather, gave the mother six pounds of sugar. They certainly did\r\nthings properly! At the baptism supper which took place at the Coupeaus\r\nthat evening, they did not come empty-handed. Lorilleux carried a\r\nbottle of fine wine under each arm and his wife brought a large custard\r\npie from a famous pastry shop on Chaussee Clignancourt. But the\r\nLorilleuxs made sure that the entire neighborhood knew they had spent\r\ntwenty francs. As soon as Gervaise learned of their gossiping, furious,\r\nshe stopped giving them credit for generosity.\r\n\r\nIt was at the christening feast that the Coupeaus ended by becoming\r\nintimately acquainted with their neighbors on the opposite side of the\r\nlanding. The other lodging in the little house was occupied by two\r\npersons, mother and son, the Goujets as they were called. Until then\r\nthe two families had merely nodded to each other on the stairs and in\r\nthe street, nothing more; the Coupeaus thought their neighbors seemed\r\nrather bearish. Then the mother, having carried up a pail of water for\r\nGervaise on the morrow of her confinement, the latter had thought it\r\nthe proper thing to invite them to the feast, more especially as she\r\nconsidered them very respectable people. And naturally, they there\r\nbecame well acquainted with each other.\r\n\r\nThe Goujets came from the Departement du Nord. The mother mended lace;\r\nthe son, a blacksmith, worked at an iron bolt factory. They had lived\r\nin their lodging for five years. Behind the quiet peacefulness of their\r\nlife, a long standing sorrow was hidden. Goujet the father, one day\r\nwhen furiously drunk at Lille, had beaten a comrade to death with an\r\niron bar and had afterwards strangled himself in prison with his\r\nhandkerchief. The widow and child, who had come to Paris after their\r\nmisfortune, always felt the tragedy hanging over their heads, and\r\natoned for it by a strict honesty and an unvarying gentleness and\r\ncourage. They had a certain amount of pride in their attitude and\r\nregarded themselves as better than other people.\r\n\r\nMadame Goujet, dressed in black as usual, her forehead framed in a\r\nnun\xe2\x80\x99s hood, had a pale, calm, matronly face, as if the whiteness of the\r\nlace and the delicate work of her fingers had cast a glow of serenity\r\nover her. Goujet was twenty-three years old, huge, magnificently built,\r\nwith deep blue eyes and rosy cheeks, and the strength of Hercules. His\r\ncomrades at the shop called him \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Mouth\xe2\x80\x9d because of his handsome\r\nblonde beard.\r\n\r\nGervaise at once felt a great friendship for these people. When she\r\nentered their home for the first time, she was amazed at the\r\ncleanliness of the lodging. There was no denying it, one might blow\r\nabout the place without raising a grain of dust; and the tiled floor\r\nshone like a mirror. Madame Goujet made her enter her son\xe2\x80\x99s room, just\r\nto see it. It was pretty and white like the room of a young girl; an\r\niron bedstead with muslin curtains, a table, a washstand, and a narrow\r\nbookcase hanging against the wall. Then there were pictures all over\r\nthe place, figures cut out, colored engravings nailed up with four\r\ntacks, and portraits of all kinds of persons taken from the illustrated\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nMadame Goujet said with a smile that her son was a big baby. He found\r\nthat reading in the evening put him to sleep, so he amused himself\r\nlooking at pictures. Gervaise spent an hour with her neighbor without\r\nnoticing the passing of time. Madame Goujet had gone to sit by the\r\nwindow and work on her lace. Gervaise was fascinated by the hundreds of\r\npins that held the lace, and she felt happy to be there, breathing in\r\nthe good clean atmosphere of this home where such a delicate task\r\nenforced a sort of meditative silence.\r\n\r\nThe Goujets were worth visiting. They worked long hours, and placed\r\nmore than a quarter of their fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s earnings in the savings-bank.\r\nIn the neighborhood everyone nodded to them, everyone talked of their\r\nsavings. Goujet never had a hole in his clothes, always went out in a\r\nclean short blue blouse, without a stain. He was very polite, and even\r\na trifle timid, in spite of his broad shoulders. The washerwomen at the\r\nend of the street laughed to see him hold down his head when he passed\r\nthem. He did not like their oaths, and thought it disgusting that women\r\nshould be constantly uttering foul words. One day, however, he came\r\nhome tipsy. Then Madame Goujet, for sole reproach, held his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait before him, a daub of a painting hidden away at the bottom of\r\na drawer; and, ever since that lesson, Goujet never drank more than was\r\ngood for him, without however, any hatred of wine, for wine is\r\nnecessary to the workman. On Sundays he walked out with his mother, who\r\ntook hold of his arm. He would generally conduct her to Vincennes; at\r\nother times they would go to the theatre. His mother remained his\r\npassion. He still spoke to her as though he were a little child.\r\nSquare-headed, his skin toughened by the wielding of the heavy hammer,\r\nhe somewhat resembled the larger animals: dull of intellect, though\r\ngood-natured all the same.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of their acquaintance, Gervaise embarrassed him\r\nimmensely. Then in a few weeks he became accustomed to her. He watched\r\nfor her that he might carry up her parcels, treated her as a sister,\r\nwith an abrupt familiarity, and cut out pictures for her. One morning,\r\nhowever, having opened her door without knocking, he beheld her half\r\nundressed, washing her neck; and, for a week, he did not dare to look\r\nher in the face, so much so that he ended by making her blush herself.\r\n\r\nYoung Cassis, with the casual wit of a born Parisian, called Golden\r\nMouth a dolt. It was all right not to get drunk all the time or chase\r\nwomen, but still, a man must be a man, or else he might as well wear\r\nskirts. Coupeau teased him in front of Gervaise, accusing him of making\r\nup to all the women in the neighborhood. Goujet vigorously defended\r\nhimself against the charge.\r\n\r\nBut this didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent the two workingmen from becoming best of\r\nfriends. They went off to work together in the mornings and sometimes\r\nhad a glass of beer together on the way home.\r\n\r\nIt eventually came about that Golden Mouth could render a service to\r\nYoung Cassis, one of those favors that is remembered forever.\r\n\r\nIt was the second of December. The zinc-worker decided, just for the\r\nfun of it, to go into the city and watch the rioting. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\ncare about the Republic, or Napoleon or anything like that, but he\r\nliked the smell of gunpowder and the sound of the rifles firing. He\r\nwould have been arrested as a rioter if the blacksmith hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned up\r\nat the barricade at just that moment and helped him escape. Goujet was\r\nvery serious as they walked back up the Rue du Faubourg Poissonniere.\r\nHe was interested in politics and believed in the Republic. But he had\r\nnever fired a gun because the common people were getting tired of\r\nfighting battles for the middle classes who always seemed to get the\r\nbenefit of them.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the top of the slope of the Rue du Faubourg\r\nPoissonniere, Goujet turned to look back at Paris and the mobs. After\r\nall, some day people would be sorry that they just stood by and did\r\nnothing. Coupeau laughed at this, saying you would be pretty stupid to\r\nrisk your neck just to preserve the twenty-five francs a day for the\r\nlazybones in the Legislative Assembly. That evening the Coupeaus\r\ninvited the Goujets to dinner. After desert Young Cassis and Golden\r\nMouth kissed each other on the cheek. Their lives were joined till\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFor three years the existence of the two families went on, on either\r\nside of the landing, without an event. Gervaise was able to take care\r\nof her daughter and still work most of the week. She was now a skilled\r\nworker on fine laundry and earned up to three francs a day. She decided\r\nto put Etienne, now nearly eight, into a small boarding-school on Rue\r\nde Chartres for five francs a week. Despite the expenses for the two\r\nchildren, they were able to save twenty or thirty francs each month.\r\nOnce they had six hundred francs saved, Gervaise often lay awake\r\nthinking of her ambitious dream: she wanted to rent a small shop, hire\r\nworkers, and go into the laundry business herself. If this effort\r\nworked, they would have a steady income from savings in twenty years.\r\nThey could retire and live in the country.\r\n\r\nYet she hesitated, saying she was looking for the right shop. She was\r\ngiving herself time to think it over. Their savings were safe in the\r\nbank, and growing larger. So, in three years\xe2\x80\x99 time she had only\r\nfulfilled one of her dreams\xe2\x80\x94she had bought a clock. But even this\r\nclock, made of rosewood with twined columns and a pendulum of gilded\r\nbrass, was being paid for in installments of twenty-two sous each\r\nMonday for a year. She got upset if Coupeau tried to wind it; she liked\r\nto be the only one to lift off the glass dome. It was under the glass\r\ndome, behind the clock, that she hid her bank book. Sometimes, when she\r\nwas dreaming of her shop, she would stare fixedly at the clock, lost in\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThe Coupeaus went out nearly every Sunday with the Goujets. They were\r\npleasant little excursions, sometimes to have some fried fish at\r\nSaint-Ouen, at others a rabbit at Vincennes, in the garden of some\r\neating-house keeper without any grand display. The men drank sufficient\r\nto quench their thirst, and returned home as right as nine-pins, giving\r\ntheir arms to the ladies. In the evening before going to bed, the two\r\nfamilies made up accounts and each paid half the expenses; and there\r\nwas never the least quarrel about a sou more or less.\r\n\r\nThe Lorilleuxs became jealous of the Goujets. It seemed strange to them\r\nto see Young Cassis and Clump-clump going places all the time with\r\nstrangers instead of their own relations. But, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it was;\r\nsome folks didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit about their family. Now that they had\r\nsaved a few sous, they thought they were really somebody. Madame\r\nLorilleux was much annoyed to see her brother getting away from her\r\ninfluence and begin to continually run down Gervaise to everyone. On\r\nthe other hand, Madame Lerat took the young wife\xe2\x80\x99s side. Mother Coupeau\r\ntried to get along with everybody. She only wanted to be welcomed by\r\nall three of her children. Now that her eyesight was getting dimmer and\r\ndimmer she only had one regular house cleaning job but she was able to\r\npick up some small jobs now and again.\r\n\r\nOn the day on which Nana was three years old, Coupeau, on returning\r\nhome in the evening, found Gervaise quite upset. She refused to talk\r\nabout it; there was nothing at all the matter with her, she said. But,\r\nas she had the table all wrong, standing still with the plates in her\r\nhands, absorbed in deep reflection, her husband insisted upon knowing\r\nwhat was the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is this,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe little draper\xe2\x80\x99s shop in\r\nthe Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, is to let. I saw it only an hour ago, when\r\ngoing to buy some cotton. It gave me quite a turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a very decent shop, and in that big house where they dreamed of\r\nliving in former days. There was the shop, a back room, and two other\r\nrooms to the right and left; in short, just what they required. The\r\nrooms were rather small, but well placed. Only, she considered they\r\nwanted too much; the landlord talked of five hundred francs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve been over the place, and asked the price?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you know, only out of curiosity!\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, affecting an air of\r\nindifference. \xe2\x80\x9cOne looks about, and goes in wherever there\xe2\x80\x99s a bill\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bind one to anything. But that shop is altogether too\r\ndear. Besides, it would perhaps be foolish of me to set up in\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, after dinner, she again referred to the draper\xe2\x80\x99s shop. She\r\ndrew a plan of the place on the margin of a newspaper. And, little by\r\nlittle, she talked it over, measuring the corners, and arranging the\r\nrooms, as though she were going to move all her furniture in there on\r\nthe morrow. Then Coupeau advised her to take it, seeing how she wanted\r\nto do so; she would certainly never find anything decent under five\r\nhundred francs; besides they might perhaps get a reduction. He knew\r\nonly one objection to it and that was living in the same house as the\r\nLorilleux, whom she could not bear.\r\n\r\nGervaise declared that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t mad at anybody. So much did she want\r\nher own shop that she even spoke up for the Lorilleuxs, saying that\r\nthey weren\xe2\x80\x99t mean at heart and that she would be able to get along just\r\nfine with them. When they went to bed, Coupeau fell asleep immediately,\r\nbut she stayed awake, planning how she could arrange the new place even\r\nthough she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet made up her mind completely.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, when she was alone, she could not resist removing the\r\nglass cover from the clock, and taking a peep at the savings-bank book.\r\nTo think that her shop was there, in those dirty pages, covered with\r\nugly writing! Before going off to her work, she consulted Madame\r\nGoujet, who highly approved her project of setting up in business for\r\nherself; with a husband like hers, a good fellow who did not drink, she\r\nwas certain of getting on, and of not having her earnings squandered.\r\nAt the luncheon hour Gervaise even called on the Lorilleuxs to ask\r\ntheir advice; she did not wish to appear to be doing anything unknown\r\nto the family. Madame Lorilleux was struck all of a heap. What!\r\nClump-clump was going in for a shop now! And her heart bursting with\r\nenvy, she stammered, and tried to pretend to be pleased: no doubt the\r\nshop was a convenient one\xe2\x80\x94Gervaise was right in taking it. However,\r\nwhen she had somewhat recovered, she and her husband talked of the\r\ndampness of the courtyard, of the poor light of the rooms on the ground\r\nfloor. Oh! it was a good place for rheumatism. Yet, if she had made up\r\nher mind to take it, their observations, of course, would not make her\r\nalter her decision.\r\n\r\nThat evening Gervaise frankly owned with a laugh that she would have\r\nfallen ill if she had been prevented from having the shop.\r\nNevertheless, before saying \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s done!\xe2\x80\x9d she wished to take Coupeau to\r\nsee the place, and try and obtain a reduction in the rent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, to-morrow, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\ncome and fetch me towards six o\xe2\x80\x99clock at the house where I\xe2\x80\x99m working,\r\nin the Rue de la Nation, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll call in at the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or\r\non our way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau was then finishing the roofing of a new three-storied house. It\r\nso happened that on that day he was to fix the last sheets of zinc. As\r\nthe roof was almost flat, he had set up his bench on it, a wide shutter\r\nsupported on two trestles. A beautiful May sun was setting, giving a\r\ngolden hue to the chimney-pots. And, right up at the top, against the\r\nclear sky, the workman was quietly cutting up his zinc with a big pair\r\nof shears, leaning over the bench, and looking like a tailor in his\r\nshop cutting out a pair of trousers. Close to the wall of the next\r\nhouse, his boy, a youngster of seventeen, thin and fair, was keeping\r\nthe fire of the chafing dish blazing by the aid of an enormous pair of\r\nbellows, each puff of which raised a cloud of sparks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Zidore, put in the irons!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau.\r\n\r\nThe boy stuck the soldering irons into the midst of the charcoal, which\r\nlooked a pale rose color in the daylight. Then he resumed blowing.\r\nCoupeau held the last sheet of zinc. It had to be placed at the edge of\r\nthe roof, close to the gutter-pipe; there was an abrupt slant there,\r\nand the gaping void of the street opened beneath. The zinc-worker, just\r\nas though in his own home, wearing his list-shoes, advanced, dragging\r\nhis feet, and whistling the air, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! the little lambs.\xe2\x80\x9d Arrived in\r\nfront of the opening, he let himself down, and then, supporting himself\r\nwith one knee against the masonry of a chimney-stack, remained half-way\r\nout over the pavement below. One of his legs dangled. When he leant\r\nback to call that young viper, Zidore, he held on to a corner of the\r\nmasonry, on account of the street beneath him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou confounded dawdler! Give me the irons! It\xe2\x80\x99s no use looking up in\r\nthe air, you skinny beggar! The larks won\xe2\x80\x99t tumble into your mouth\r\nalready cooked!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Zidore did not hurry himself. He was interested in the neighboring\r\nroofs, and in a cloud of smoke which rose from the other side of Paris,\r\nclose to Grenelle; it was very likely a fire. However, he came and laid\r\ndown on his stomach, his head over the opening, and he passed the irons\r\nto Coupeau. Then the latter commenced to solder the sheet. He squatted,\r\nhe stretched, always managing to balance himself, sometimes seated on\r\none side, at other times standing on the tip of one foot, often only\r\nholding on by a finger. He had a confounded assurance, the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ncheek, familiar with danger, and braving it. It knew him. It was the\r\nstreet that was afraid, not he. As he kept his pipe in his mouth, he\r\nturned round every now and then to spit onto the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, there\xe2\x80\x99s Madame Boche,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly exclaimed and called down to\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cHi! Madame Boche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had just caught sight of the concierge crossing the road. She raised\r\nher head and recognised him, and a conversation ensued between them.\r\nShe hid her hands under her apron, her nose elevated in the air. He,\r\nstanding up now, his left arm passed round a chimney-pot, leant over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the concierge. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she around here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s coming to fetch me. And are they all well at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, thanks; I\xe2\x80\x99m the most ill, as you see. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the\r\nChaussee Clignancourt to buy a small leg of mutton. The butcher near\r\nthe Moulin-Rouge only charges sixteen sous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey raised their voices, because a vehicle was passing. In the wide,\r\ndeserted Rue de la Nation, their words, shouted out with all their\r\nmight, had only caused a little old woman to come to her window; and\r\nthis little old woman remained there leaning out, giving herself the\r\ntreat of a grand emotion by watching that man on the roof over the way,\r\nas though she expected to see him fall, from one minute to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Good evening,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t disturb you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau turned round, and took back the iron that Zidore was holding\r\nfor him. But just as the concierge was moving off, she caught sight of\r\nGervaise on the other side of the way, holding Nana by the hand. She\r\nwas already raising her head to tell the zinc-worker, when the young\r\nwoman closed her mouth by an energetic gesture, and, in a low voice, so\r\nas not to be heard up there, she told her of her fear: she was afraid,\r\nby showing herself suddenly, of giving her husband a shock which might\r\nmake him lose his balance. During the four years, she had only been\r\nonce to fetch him at his work. That day was the second time. She could\r\nnot witness it, her blood turned cold when she beheld her old man\r\nbetween heaven and earth, in places where even the sparrows would not\r\nventure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, it\xe2\x80\x99s not pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ntailor, so I have none of these terrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only knew, in the early days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise again, \xe2\x80\x9cI had\r\nfrights from morning till night. I was always seeing him on a\r\nstretcher, with his head smashed. Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it so much. One\r\ngets used to everything. Bread must be earned. All the same, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nprecious dear loaf, for one risks one\xe2\x80\x99s bones more than is fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she left off speaking, hiding Nana in her skirt, fearing a cry from\r\nthe little one. Very pale, she looked up in spite of herself. At that\r\nmoment Coupeau was soldering the extreme edge of the sheet close to the\r\ngutter; he slid down as far as possible, but without being able to\r\nreach the edge. Then, he risked himself with those slow movements\r\npeculiar to workmen. For an instant he was immediately over the\r\npavement, no long holding on, all absorbed in his work; and, from\r\nbelow, one could see the little white flame of the solder frizzling up\r\nbeneath the carefully wielded iron. Gervaise, speechless, her throat\r\ncontracted with anguish, had clasped her hands together, and held them\r\nup in mechanical gesture of prayer. But she breathed freely as Coupeau\r\ngot up and returned back along the roof, without hurrying himself, and\r\ntaking the time to spit once more into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah! so you\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing the spy on me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, gaily, on\r\nbeholding her. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s been making a stupid of herself, eh, Madame\r\nBoche? She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call to me. Wait a bit, I shall have finished in\r\nten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll that remained to do was to fix the top of the chimney\xe2\x80\x94a mere\r\nnothing. The laundress and the concierge waited on the pavement,\r\ndiscussing the neighborhood, and giving an eye to Nana, to prevent her\r\nfrom dabbling in the gutter, where she wanted to look for little\r\nfishes; and the two women kept glancing up at the roof, smiling and\r\nnodding their heads, as though to imply that they were not losing\r\npatience. The old woman opposite had not left her window, had continued\r\nwatching the man, and waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever can she have to look at, that old she-goat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame\r\nBoche. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mug she has!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne could hear the loud voice of the zinc-worker up above singing, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s nice to gather strawberries!\xe2\x80\x9d Bending over his bench, he was now\r\nartistically cutting out his zinc. With his compasses he traced a line,\r\nand he detached a large fan-shaped piece with the aid of a pair of\r\ncurved shears; then he lightly bent this fan with his hammer into the\r\nform of a pointed mushroom. Zidore was again blowing the charcoal in\r\nthe chafing-dish. The sun was setting behind the house in a brilliant\r\nrosy light, which was gradually becoming paler, and turning to a\r\ndelicate lilac. And, at this quiet hour of the day, right up against\r\nthe sky, the silhouettes of the two workmen, looking inordinately\r\nlarge, with the dark line of the bench, and the strange profile of the\r\nbellows, stood out from the limpid back-ground of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen the chimney-top was got into shape, Coupeau called out: \xe2\x80\x9cZidore!\r\nThe irons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Zidore had disappeared. The zinc-worker swore, and looked about for\r\nhim, even calling him through the open skylight of the loft. At length\r\nhe discovered him on a neighboring roof, two houses off. The young\r\nrogue was taking a walk, exploring the environs, his fair scanty locks\r\nblowing in the breeze, his eyes blinking as they beheld the immensity\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, lazy bones! Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re having a day in the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Coupeau, in a rage. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re like Monsieur Beranger, composing\r\nverses, perhaps! Will you give me those irons! Did any one ever see\r\nsuch a thing! Strolling about on the house-tops! Why not bring your\r\nsweetheart at once, and tell her of your love? Will you give me those\r\nirons? You confounded little shirker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe finished his soldering, and called to Gervaise: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, it\xe2\x80\x99s done.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m coming down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chimney-pot to which he had to fix the flue was in the middle of\r\nthe roof. Gervaise, who was no longer uneasy, continued to smile as she\r\nfollowed his movements. Nana, amused all on a sudden by the view of her\r\nfather, clapped her little hands. She had seated herself on the\r\npavement to see the better up there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d called she with all her might. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Just look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe zinc-worker wished to lean forward, but his foot slipped. Then\r\nsuddenly, stupidly, like a cat with its legs entangled, he rolled and\r\ndescended the slight slope of the roof without being able to grab hold\r\nof anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu_,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a choked voice.\r\n\r\nAnd he fell. His body described a gentle curve, turned twice over on\r\nitself, and came smashing into the middle of the street with the dull\r\nthud of a bundle of clothes thrown from on high.\r\n\r\nGervaise, stupefied, her throat rent by one great cry, stood holding up\r\nher arms. Some passers-by hastened to the spot; a crowd soon formed.\r\nMadame Boche, utterly upset, her knees bending under her, took Nana in\r\nher arms, to hide her head and prevent her seeing. Meanwhile, the\r\nlittle old woman opposite quietly closed her window, as though\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nFour men ended by carrying Coupeau into a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s, at the corner of\r\nthe Rue des Poissonniers; and he remained there on a blanket, in the\r\nmiddle of the shop, whilst they sent to the Lariboisiere Hospital for a\r\nstretcher. He was still breathing.\r\n\r\nGervaise, sobbing, was kneeling on the floor beside him, her face\r\nsmudged with tears, stunned and unseeing. Her hands would reach to feel\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s limbs with the utmost gentleness. Then she would draw\r\nback as she had been warned not to touch him. But a few seconds later\r\nshe would touch him to assure herself that he was still warm, feeling\r\nsomehow that she was helping him.\r\n\r\nWhen the stretcher at length arrived, and they talked of starting for\r\nthe hospital, she got up, saying violently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, not to the hospital! We live in the Rue Neuve de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was useless for them to explain to her that the illness would cost\r\nher a great deal of money, if she took her husband home. She\r\nobstinately repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRue Neuve de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or; I will show you the house. What can it\r\nmatter to you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got money. He\xe2\x80\x99s my husband, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? He\xe2\x80\x99s mine,\r\nand I want him at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they had to take Coupeau to his own home. When the stretcher was\r\ncarried through the crowd which was crushing up against the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshop, the women of the neighborhood were excitedly talking of Gervaise.\r\nShe limped, the dolt, but all the same she had some pluck. She would be\r\nsure to save her old man; whilst at the hospital the doctors let the\r\npatients die who were very bad, so as not to have the bother of trying\r\nto cure them. Madame Boche, after taking Nana home with her, returned,\r\nand gave her account of the accident, with interminable details, and\r\nstill feeling agitated with the emotion she had passed through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to buy a leg of mutton; I was there, I saw him fall,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrepeated she. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all through the little one; he turned to look at\r\nher, and bang! Ah! good heavens! I never want to see such a sight\r\nagain. However, I must be off to get my leg of mutton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a week Coupeau was very bad. The family, the neighbors, everyone,\r\nexpected to see him turn for the worse at any moment. The doctor\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\nexpensive doctor, who charged five francs for each visit\xe2\x80\x94apprehended\r\ninternal injuries, and these words filled everyone with fear. It was\r\nsaid in the neighborhood that the zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s heart had been injured\r\nby the shock. Gervaise alone, looking pale through her nights of\r\nwatching, serious and resolute, shrugged her shoulders. Her old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright leg was broken, everyone knew that; it would be set for him, and\r\nthat was all. As for the rest, the injured heart, that was nothing. She\r\nknew how to restore a heart with ceaseless care. She was certain of\r\ngetting him well and displayed magnificent faith. She stayed close by\r\nhim and caressed him gently during the long bouts of fever without a\r\nmoment of doubt. She was on her feet continuously for a whole week,\r\ncompletely absorbed by her determination to save him. She forgot the\r\nstreet outside, the entire city, and even her own children. On the\r\nninth day, the doctor finally said that Coupeau would live. Gervaise\r\ncollapsed into a chair, her body limp from fatigue. That night she\r\nconsented to sleep for two hours with her head against the foot of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s accident had created quite a commotion in the family. Mother\r\nCoupeau passed the nights with Gervaise; but as early as nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nshe fell asleep on a chair. Every evening, on returning from work,\r\nMadame Lerat went a long round out of her way to inquire how her\r\nbrother was getting on. At first the Lorilleuxs had called two or three\r\ntimes a day, offering to sit up and watch, and even bringing an\r\neasy-chair for Gervaise. Then it was not long before there were\r\ndisputes as to the proper way to nurse invalids. Madame Lorilleux said\r\nthat she had saved enough people\xe2\x80\x99s lives to know how to go about it.\r\nShe accused the young wife of pushing her aside, of driving her away\r\nfrom her own brother\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Certainly that Clump-clump ought to be\r\nconcerned about Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s getting well, for if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone to Rue\r\nde la Nation to disturb him at his job, he would never had fallen.\r\nOnly, the way she was taking care of him, she would certainly finish\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise saw that Coupeau was out of danger, she ceased guarding\r\nhis bedside with so much jealous fierceness. Now, they could no longer\r\nkill him, and she let people approach without mistrust. The family\r\ninvaded the room. The convalescence would be a very long one; the\r\ndoctor had talked of four months. Then, during the long hours the\r\nzinc-worker slept, the Lorilleux talked of Gervaise as of a fool. She\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t done any good by having her husband at home. At the hospital\r\nthey would have cured him twice as quickly. Lorilleux would have liked\r\nto have been ill, to have caught no matter what, just to show her that\r\nhe did not hesitate for a moment to go to Lariboisiere. Madame\r\nLorilleux knew a lady who had just come from there. Well! She had had\r\nchicken to eat morning and night.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the two of them went over their estimate of how much\r\nfour months of convalescence would cost; workdays lost, the doctor and\r\nthe medicines, and afterward good wine and fresh meat. If the Coupeaus\r\nonly used up their small savings, they would be very lucky indeed. They\r\nwould probably have to go into debt. Well, that was to be expected and\r\nit was their business. They had no right to expect any help from the\r\nfamily, which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford the luxury of keeping an invalid at home.\r\nIt was just Clump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s bad luck, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she have\r\ndone as others did and let her man be taken to hospital? This just\r\nshowed how stuck up she was.\r\n\r\nOne evening Madame Lorilleux had the spitefulness to ask Gervaise\r\nsuddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! And your shop, when are you going to take it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled Lorilleux, \xe2\x80\x9cthe landlord\xe2\x80\x99s still waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise was astonished. She had completely forgotten the shop; but she\r\nsaw the wicked joy of those people, at the thought that she would no\r\nlonger be able to take it, and she was bursting with anger. From that\r\nevening, in fact, they watched for every opportunity to twit her about\r\nher hopeless dream. When any one spoke of some impossible wish, they\r\nwould say that it might be realized on the day that Gervaise started in\r\nbusiness, in a beautiful shop opening onto the street. And behind her\r\nback they would laugh fit to split their sides. She did not like to\r\nthink such an unkind thing, but, really, the Lorilleuxs now seemed to\r\nbe very pleased at Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s accident, as it prevented her setting up\r\nas a laundress in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or.\r\n\r\nThen she also wished to laugh, and show them how willingly she parted\r\nwith the money for the sake of curing her husband. Each time she took\r\nthe savings-bank book from beneath the glass clock-tower in their\r\npresence, she would say gaily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going out; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to rent my shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not been willing to withdraw the money all at once. She took it\r\nout a hundred francs at a time, so as not to keep such a pile of gold\r\nand silver in her drawer; then, too, she vaguely hoped for some\r\nmiracle, some sudden recovery, which would enable them not to part with\r\nthe entire sum. At each journey to the savings-bank, on her return\r\nhome, she added up on a piece of paper the money they had still left\r\nthere. It was merely for the sake of order. Their bank account might be\r\ngetting smaller all the time, yet she went on with her quiet smile and\r\ncommon-sense attitude, keeping the account straight. It was a\r\nconsolation to be able to use this money for such a good purpose, to\r\nhave had it when faced with their misfortune.\r\n\r\nWhile Coupeau was bed-ridden the Goujets were very kind to Gervaise.\r\nMadame Goujet was always ready to assist. She never went to shop\r\nwithout stopping to ask Gervaise if there was anything she needed,\r\nsugar or butter or salt. She always brought over hot bouillon on the\r\nevenings she cooked _pot au feu_. Sometimes, when Gervaise seemed to\r\nhave too much to do, Madame Goujet helped her do the dishes, or cleaned\r\nthe kitchen herself. Goujet took her water pails every morning and\r\nfilled them at the tap on Rue des Poissonniers, saving her two sous a\r\nday. After dinner, if no family came to visit, the Goujets would come\r\nover to visit with the Coupeaus.\r\n\r\nUntil ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the blacksmith would smoke his pipe and watch\r\nGervaise busy with her invalid. He would not speak ten words the entire\r\nevening. He was moved to pity by the sight of her pouring Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s tea\r\nand medicine into a cup, or stirring the sugar in it very carefully so\r\nas to make no sound with the spoon. It stirred him deeply when she\r\nwould lean over Coupeau and speak in her soft voice. Never before had\r\nhe known such a fine woman. Her limp increased the credit due her for\r\nwearing herself out doing things for her husband all day long. She\r\nnever sat down for ten minutes, not even to eat. She was always running\r\nto the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s. And then she would still keep the house clean, not\r\neven a speck of dust. She never complained, no matter how exhausted she\r\nbecame. Goujet developed a very deep affection for Gervaise in this\r\natmosphere of unselfish devotion.\r\n\r\nOne day he said to the invalid, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, old man, now you\xe2\x80\x99re patched up\r\nagain! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worried about you. Your wife works miracles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoujet was supposed to be getting married. His mother had found a\r\nsuitable girl, a lace-mender like herself, whom she was urging him to\r\nmarry. He had agreed so as not to hurt her feelings and the wedding had\r\nbeen set for early September. Money had long since been saved to set\r\nthem up in housekeeping. However, when Gervaise referred to his coming\r\nmarriage, he shook his head, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNot every woman is like you,\r\nMadame Coupeau. If all women were like you, I\xe2\x80\x99d marry ten of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of two months, Coupeau was able to get up. He did not go\r\nfar, only from the bed to the window, and even then Gervaise had to\r\nsupport him. There he would sit down in the easy-chair the Lorilleuxs\r\nhad brought, with his right leg stretched out on a stool. This joker,\r\nwho used to laugh at the people who slipped down on frosty days, felt\r\ngreatly put out by his accident. He had no philosophy. He had spent\r\nthose two months in bed, in cursing, and in worrying the people about\r\nhim. It was not an existence, really, to pass one\xe2\x80\x99s life on one\xe2\x80\x99s back,\r\nwith a pin all tied up and as stiff as a sausage. Ah, he certainly knew\r\nthe ceiling by heart; there was a crack, at the corner of the alcove,\r\nthat he could have drawn with his eyes shut. Then, when he was made\r\ncomfortable in the easy-chair, it was another grievance. Would he be\r\nfixed there for long, just like a mummy?\r\n\r\nNobody ever passed along the street, so it was no fun to watch.\r\nBesides, it stank of bleach water all day. No, he was just growing old;\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d have given ten years of his life just to go see how the\r\nfortifications were getting along. He kept going on about his fate. It\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t right, what had happened to him. A good worker like him, not a\r\nloafer or a drunkard, he could have understood in that case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbroke his neck one day that he\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nboozing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that it was deserved, but anyhow it was\r\nexplainable. I had had nothing since my lunch, was perfectly quiet, and\r\nwithout a drop of liquor in my body; and yet I came to grief just\r\nbecause I wanted to turn round to smile at Nana! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo much? If there is a providence, it certainly arranges things in a\r\nvery peculiar manner. I, for one, shall never believe in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when at last he was able to use his legs, he retained a secret\r\ngrudge against work. It was a handicraft full of misfortunes to pass\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s days, like the cats, on the roofs of the houses. The employers\r\nwere no fools! They sent you to your death\xe2\x80\x94being far too cowardly to\r\nventure themselves on a ladder\xe2\x80\x94and stopped at home in safety at their\r\nfire-sides without caring a hang for the poorer classes; and he got to\r\nthe point of saying that everyone ought to fix the zinc himself on his\r\nown house. _Mon Dieu_! It was the only fair way to do it! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant the rain to come in, do the work yourself. He regretted he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlearned another trade, something more pleasant, something less\r\ndangerous, maybe cabinetmaking. It was really his father\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Lots\r\nof fathers have the foolish habit of shoving their sons into their own\r\nline of work.\r\n\r\nFor another two months Coupeau hobbled about on crutches. He had first\r\nof all managed to get as far as the street, and smoke his pipe in front\r\nof the door. Then he had managed to reach the exterior Boulevard,\r\ndragging himself along in the sunshine, and remaining for hours on one\r\nof the seats. Gaiety returned to him; his infernal tongue got sharper\r\nin these long hours of idleness. And with the pleasure of living, he\r\ngained there a delight in doing nothing, an indolent feeling took\r\npossession of his limbs, and his muscles gradually glided into a very\r\nsweet slumber. It was the slow victory of laziness, which took\r\nadvantage of his convalescence to obtain possession of his body and\r\nunnerve him with its tickling. He regained his health, as thorough a\r\nbanterer as before, thinking life beautiful, and not seeing why it\r\nshould not last for ever.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could get about without the crutches, he made longer\r\nwalks, often visiting construction jobs to see old comrades. He would\r\nstand with his arms folded, sneering and shaking his head, ridiculing\r\nthe workers slaving at the job, stretching out his leg to show them\r\nwhat you got for wearing yourself out. Being able to stand about and\r\nmock others while they were working satisfied his spite against hard\r\nwork. No doubt he\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back to it, but he\xe2\x80\x99d put it off as long\r\nas possible. He had a reason now to be lazy. Besides, it seemed good to\r\nhim to loaf around like a bum!\r\n\r\nOn the afternoons when Coupeau felt dull, he would call on the\r\nLorilleuxs. The latter would pity him immensely, and attract him with\r\nall sorts of amiable attentions. During the first years following his\r\nmarriage, he had avoided them, thanks to Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s influence. Now they\r\nregained their sway over him by twitting him about being afraid of his\r\nwife. He was no man, that was evident! The Lorilleuxs, however, showed\r\ngreat discretion, and were loud in their praise of the laundress\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nqualities. Coupeau, without as yet coming to wrangling, swore to the\r\nlatter that his sister adored her, and requested that she would behave\r\nmore amiably to her. The first quarrel which the couple had occurred\r\none evening on account of Etienne. The zinc-worker had passed the\r\nafternoon with the Lorilleuxs. On arriving home, as the dinner was not\r\nquite ready, and the children were whining for their soup, he suddenly\r\nturned upon Etienne, and boxed his ears soundly. And during an hour he\r\ndid not cease to grumble; the brat was not his; he did not know why he\r\nallowed him to be in the place; he would end by turning him out into\r\nthe street. Up till then he had tolerated the youngster without all\r\nthat fuss. On the morrow he talked of his dignity. Three days after, he\r\nkept kicking the little fellow, morning and evening, so much so that\r\nthe child, whenever he heard him coming, bolted into the Goujets\xe2\x80\x99 where\r\nthe old lace-mender kept a corner of the table clear for him to do his\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nGervaise had for some time past, returned to work. She no longer had\r\nthe trouble of looking under the glass cover of the clock; all the\r\nsavings were gone; and she had to work hard, work for four, for there\r\nwere four to feed now. She alone maintained them. Whenever she heard\r\npeople pitying her, she at once found excuses for Coupeau. Recollect!\r\nHe had suffered so much; it was not surprising if his disposition had\r\nsoured! But it would pass off when his health returned. And if any one\r\nhinted that Coupeau seemed all right again, that he could very well\r\nreturn to work, she protested: No, no; not yet! She did not want to see\r\nhim take to his bed again. They would allow her to know best what the\r\ndoctor said, perhaps! It was she who prevented him returning to work,\r\ntelling him every morning to take his time and not to force himself.\r\nShe even slipped twenty sou pieces into his waistcoat pocket. Coupeau\r\naccepted this as something perfectly natural. He was always complaining\r\nof aches and pains so that she would coddle him. At the end of six\r\nmonths he was still convalescing.\r\n\r\nNow, whenever he went to watch others working, he was always ready to\r\njoin his comrades in downing a shot. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad, after all. They\r\nhad their fun, and they never stayed more than five minutes. That\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt anybody. Only a hypocrite would say he went in because he\r\nwanted a drink. No wonder they had laughed at him in the past. A glass\r\nof wine never hurt anybody. He only drank wine though, never brandy.\r\nWine never made you sick, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get you drunk, and helped you to live\r\nlonger. Soon though, several times, after a day of idleness in going\r\nfrom one building job to another, he came home half drunk. On those\r\noccasions Gervaise pretended to have a terrible headache and kept their\r\ndoor closed so that the Goujets wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s drunken\r\nbabblings.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, the young woman lost her cheerfulness. Morning and\r\nevening she went to the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or to look at the shop,\r\nwhich was still to be let; and she would hide herself as though she\r\nwere committing some childish prank unworthy of a grown-up person. This\r\nshop was beginning to turn her brain. At night-time, when the light was\r\nout she experienced the charm of some forbidden pleasure by thinking of\r\nit with her eyes open. She again made her calculations; two hundred and\r\nfifty francs for the rent, one hundred and fifty francs for utensils\r\nand moving, one hundred francs in hand to keep them going for a\r\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x94in all five hundred francs at the very lowest figure. If she\r\nwas not continually thinking of it aloud, it was for fear she should be\r\nsuspected of regretting the savings swallowed up by Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s illness.\r\nShe often became quite pale, having almost allowed her desire to escape\r\nher and catching back her words, quite confused as though she had been\r\nthinking of something wicked. Now they would have to work for four or\r\nfive years before they would succeed in saving such a sum. Her regret\r\nwas at not being able to start in business at once; she would have\r\nearned all the home required, without counting on Coupeau, letting him\r\ntake months to get into the way of work again; she would no longer have\r\nbeen uneasy, but certain of the future and free from the secret fears\r\nwhich sometimes seized her when he returned home very gay and singing,\r\nand relating some joke of that animal My-Boots, whom he had treated to\r\na drink.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Gervaise being at home alone, Goujet entered, and did not\r\nhurry off again, according to his habit. He seated himself, and smoked\r\nas he watched her. He probably had something very serious to say; he\r\nthought it over, let it ripen without being able to put it into\r\nsuitable words. At length, after a long silence, he appeared to make up\r\nhis mind, and took his pipe out of his mouth to say all in a breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Gervaise, will you allow me to lend you some money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was leaning over an open drawer, looking for some dish-cloths. She\r\ngot up, her face very red. He must have seen her then, in the morning,\r\nstanding in ecstacy before the shop for close upon ten minutes. He was\r\nsmiling in an embarrassed way, as though he had made some insulting\r\nproposal. But she hastily refused. Never would she accept money from\r\nany one without knowing when she would be able to return it. Then also\r\nit was a question of too large an amount. And as he insisted, in a\r\nfrightened manner, she ended by exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your marriage? I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t take the money you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saving\r\nfor your marriage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let that bother you,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, turning red in his turn.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be married now. That was just an idea, you know.\r\nReally, I would much sooner lend you the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they both held down their heads. There was something very pleasant\r\nbetween them to which they did not give expression. And Gervaise\r\naccepted. Goujet had told his mother. They crossed the landing, and\r\nwent to see her at once. The lace-mender was very grave, and looked\r\nrather sad as she bent her face over her tambour-frame. She would not\r\nthwart her son, but she no longer approved Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s project; and she\r\nplainly told her why. Coupeau was going to the bad; Coupeau would\r\nswallow up her shop. She especially could not forgive the zinc-worker\r\nfor having refused to learn to read during his convalescence. The\r\nblacksmith had offered to teach him, but the other had sent him to the\r\nright about, saying that learning made people get thin. This had almost\r\ncaused a quarrel between the two workmen; each went his own way. Madame\r\nGoujet, however, seeing her big boy\xe2\x80\x99s beseeching glances, behaved very\r\nkindly to Gervaise. It was settled that they would lend their neighbors\r\nfive hundred francs; the latter were to repay the amount by\r\ninstallments of twenty francs a month; it would last as long as it\r\nlasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s sweet on you,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Coupeau, laughing,\r\nwhen he heard what had taken place. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite easy; he\xe2\x80\x99s too big a\r\nmuff. We\xe2\x80\x99ll pay him back his money. But, really, if he had to deal with\r\nsome people, he\xe2\x80\x99d find himself pretty well duped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the Coupeaus took the shop. All day long, Gervaise was\r\nrunning from Rue Neuve de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. When the neighbors beheld her\r\npass thus, nimble and delighted to the extent that she no longer\r\nlimped, they said she must have undergone some operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the Boches had left the Rue des Poissonniers at the\r\nApril quarter, and were now taking charge of the great house in the Rue\r\nde la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. It was a curious coincidence, all the same! One\r\nthing that worried Gervaise who had lived so quietly in her lodgings in\r\nthe Rue Neuve, was the thought of again being under the subjection of\r\nsome unpleasant person, with whom she would be continually quarrelling,\r\neither on account of water spilt in the passage or of a door shut too\r\nnoisily at night-time. Concierges are such a disagreeable class! But it\r\nwould be a pleasure to be with the Boches. They knew one another\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwould always get on well together. It would be just like members of the\r\nsame family.\r\n\r\nOn the day the Coupeaus went to sign their lease, Gervaise felt her\r\nheart swollen with pride as she passed through the high doorway. She\r\nwas then at length going to live in that house as vast as a little\r\ntown, with its interminable staircases, and passages as long and\r\nwinding as streets. She was excited by everything: the gray walls with\r\nvaricolored rugs hanging from windows to dry in the sun, the dingy\r\ncourtyard with as many holes in its pavement as a public square, the\r\nhum of activity coming through the walls. She felt joy that she was at\r\nlast about to realize her ambition. She also felt fear that she would\r\nfail and be crushed in the endless struggle against the poverty and\r\nstarvation she could feel breathing down her neck. It seemed to her\r\nthat she was doing something very bold, throwing herself into the midst\r\nof some machinery in motion, as she listened to the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhammers and the cabinetmakers\xe2\x80\x99 planes, hammering and hissing in the\r\ndepths of the work-shops on the ground floor. On that day the water\r\nflowing from the dyer\xe2\x80\x99s under the entrance porch was a very pale apple\r\ngreen. She smilingly stepped over it; to her the color was a pleasant\r\nomen.\r\n\r\nThe meeting with the landlord was to take place in the Boches\xe2\x80\x99 room.\r\nMonsieur Marescot, a wealthy cutler of the Rue de la Paix, had at one\r\ntime turned a grindstone through the streets. He was now stated to be\r\nworth several millions. He was a man of fifty-five, large and\r\nbig-boned. Even though he now wore a decoration in his button-hole, his\r\nhuge hands were still those of a former workingman. It was his joy to\r\ncarry off the scissors and knives of his tenants, to sharpen them\r\nhimself, for the fun of it. He often stayed for hours with his\r\nconcierges, closed up in the darkness of their lodges, going over the\r\naccounts. That\xe2\x80\x99s where he did all his business. He was now seated by\r\nMadame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen table, listening to her story of how the\r\ndressmaker on the third floor, staircase A, had used a filthy word in\r\nrefusing to pay her rent. He had had to work precious hard once upon a\r\ntime. But work was the high road to everything. And, after counting the\r\ntwo hundred and fifty francs for the first two quarters in advance, and\r\ndropping them into his capacious pocket, he related the story of his\r\nlife, and showed his decoration.\r\n\r\nGervaise, however, felt rather ill at ease on account of the Boches\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbehavior. They pretended not to know her. They were most assiduous in\r\ntheir attentions to the landlord, bowing down before him, watching for\r\nhis least words, and nodding their approval of them. Madame Boche\r\nsuddenly ran out and dispersed a group of children who were paddling\r\nabout in front of the cistern, the tap of which they had turned full\r\non, causing the water to flow over the pavement; and when she returned,\r\nupright and severe in her skirts, crossing the courtyard and glancing\r\nslowly up at all the windows, as though to assure herself of the good\r\nbehavior of the household, she pursed her lips in a way to show with\r\nwhat authority she was invested, now that she reigned over three\r\nhundred tenants. Boche again spoke of the dressmaker on the second\r\nfloor; he advised that she should be turned out; he reckoned up the\r\nnumber of quarters she owed with the importance of a steward whose\r\nmanagement might be compromised. Monsieur Marescot approved the\r\nsuggestion of turning her out, but he wished to wait till the half\r\nquarter. It was hard to turn people out into the street, more\r\nespecially as it did not put a sou into the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s pocket. And\r\nGervaise asked herself with a shudder if she too would be turned out\r\ninto the street the day that some misfortune rendered her unable to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nThe concierge\xe2\x80\x99s lodge was as dismal as a cellar, black from smoke and\r\ncrowded with dark furniture. All the sunlight fell upon the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworkbench by the window. An old frock coat that was being reworked lay\r\non it. The Boches\xe2\x80\x99 only child, a four-year-old redhead named Pauline,\r\nwas sitting on the floor, staring quietly at the veal simmering on the\r\nstove, delighted with the sharp odor of cooking that came from the\r\nfrying pan.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Marescot again held out his hand to the zinc-worker, when the\r\nlatter spoke of the repairs, recalling to his mind a promise he had\r\nmade to talk the matter over later on. But the landlord grew angry, he\r\nhad never promised anything; besides, it was not usual to do any\r\nrepairs to a shop. However, he consented to go over the place, followed\r\nby the Coupeaus and Boche. The little linen-draper had carried off all\r\nhis shelves and counters; the empty shop displayed its blackened\r\nceiling and its cracked wall, on which hung strips of an old yellow\r\npaper. In the sonorous emptiness of the place, there ensued a heated\r\ndiscussion. Monsieur Marescot exclaimed that it was the business of\r\nshopkeepers to embellish their shops, for a shopkeeper might wish to\r\nhave gold put about everywhere, and he, the landlord, could not put out\r\ngold. Then he related that he had spent more than twenty thousand\r\nfrancs in fitting up his premises in the Rue de la Paix. Gervaise, with\r\nher woman\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy, kept repeating an argument which she considered\r\nunanswerable. He would repaper a lodging, would he not? Then, why did\r\nhe not treat the shop the same as a lodging? She did not ask him for\r\nanything else\xe2\x80\x94only to whitewash the ceiling, and put some fresh paper\r\non the walls.\r\n\r\nBoche, all this while, remained dignified and impenetrable; he turned\r\nabout and looked up in the air, without expressing an opinion. Coupeau\r\nwinked at him in vain; he affected not to wish to take advantage of his\r\ngreat influence over the landlord. He ended, however, by making a\r\nslight grimace\xe2\x80\x94a little smile accompanied by a nod of the head. Just\r\nthen Monsieur Marescot, exasperated, and seemingly very unhappy, and\r\nclutching his fingers like a miser being despoiled of his gold, was\r\ngiving way to Gervaise, promising to do the ceiling and repaper the\r\nshop on condition that she paid for half of the paper. And he hurried\r\naway declining to discuss anything further.\r\n\r\nNow that Boche was alone with the Coupeaus, the concierge became quite\r\ntalkative and slapped them on the shoulders. Well, well, see what they\r\nhad gotten. Without his help, they would never have gotten the\r\nconcessions. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they notice how the landlord had looked to him out\r\nof the corner of his eye for advice and how he\xe2\x80\x99d made up his mind\r\nsuddenly when he saw Boche smile? He confessed to them confidentially\r\nthat he was the real boss of the building. It was he who decided who\r\ngot eviction notices and who could become tenants. He collected all the\r\nrents and kept them for a couple of weeks in his bureau drawer.\r\n\r\nThat evening the Coupeaus, to express their gratitude to the Boches,\r\nsent them two bottles of wine as a present.\r\n\r\nThe following Monday the workmen started doing up the shop. The\r\npurchasing of the paper turned out especially to be a very big affair.\r\nGervaise wanted a grey paper with blue flowers, so as to enliven and\r\nbrighten the walls. Boche offered to take her to the dealers, so that\r\nshe might make her own selection. But the landlord had given him formal\r\ninstructions not to go beyond the price of fifteen sous the piece. They\r\nwere there an hour. The laundress kept looking in despair at a very\r\npretty chintz pattern costing eighteen sous the piece, and thought all\r\nthe other papers hideous. At length the concierge gave in; he would\r\narrange the matter, and, if necessary, would make out there was a piece\r\nmore used than was really the case. So, on her way home, Gervaise\r\npurchased some tarts for Pauline. She did not like being behindhand\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nalways gained by behaving nicely to her.\r\n\r\nThe shop was to be ready in four days. The workmen were there three\r\nweeks. At first it was arranged that they should merely wash the paint.\r\nBut this paint, originally maroon, was so dirty and so sad-looking,\r\nthat Gervaise allowed herself to be tempted to have the whole of the\r\nfrontage painted a light blue with yellow moldings. Then the repairs\r\nseemed as though they would last for ever. Coupeau, as he was still not\r\nworking, arrived early each morning to see how things were going. Boche\r\nleft the overcoat or trousers on which he was working to come and\r\nsupervise. Both of them would stand and watch with their hands behind\r\ntheir backs, puffing on their pipes.\r\n\r\nThe painters were very merry fellows who would often desert their work\r\nto stand in the middle of the shop and join the discussion, shaking\r\ntheir heads for hours, admiring the work already done. The ceiling had\r\nbeen whitewashed quickly, but the paint on the walls never seemed to\r\ndry in a hurry.\r\n\r\nAround nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the painters would arrive with their paint pots\r\nwhich they stuck in a corner. They would look around and then\r\ndisappear. Perhaps they went to eat breakfast. Sometimes Coupeau would\r\ntake everyone for a drink\xe2\x80\x94Boche, the two painters and any of Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends who were nearby. This meant another afternoon wasted.\r\n\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s patience was thoroughly exhausted, when, suddenly,\r\neverything was finished in two days, the paint varnished, the paper\r\nhung, and the dirt all cleared away. The workmen had finished it off as\r\nthough they were playing, whistling away on their ladders, and singing\r\nloud enough to deafen the whole neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe moving in took place at once. During the first few days Gervaise\r\nfelt as delighted as a child. Whenever she crossed the road on\r\nreturning from some errand, she lingered to smile at her home. From a\r\ndistance her shop appeared light and gay with its pale blue signboard,\r\non which the word \xe2\x80\x9cLaundress\xe2\x80\x9d was painted in big yellow letters, amidst\r\nthe dark row of the other frontages. In the window, closed in behind by\r\nlittle muslin curtains, and hung on either side with blue paper to show\r\noff the whiteness of the linen, some shirts were displayed, with some\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s caps hanging above them on wires. She thought her shop looked\r\npretty, being the same color as the heavens.\r\n\r\nInside there was more blue; the paper, in imitation of a Pompadour\r\nchintz, represented a trellis overgrown with morning-glories. A huge\r\ntable, taking up two-thirds of the room, was her ironing-table. It was\r\ncovered with thick blanketing and draped with a strip of cretonne\r\npatterned with blue flower sprays that hid the trestles beneath.\r\n\r\nGervaise was enchanted with her pretty establishment and would often\r\nseat herself on a stool and sigh with contentment, delighted with all\r\nthe new equipment. Her first glance always went to the cast-iron stove\r\nwhere the irons were heated ten at a time, arranged over the heat on\r\nslanting rests. She would kneel down to look into the stove to make\r\nsure the apprentice had not put in too much coke.\r\n\r\nThe lodging at the back of the shop was quite decent. The Coupeaus\r\nslept in the first room, where they also did the cooking and took their\r\nmeals; a door at the back opened on to the courtyard of the house.\r\nNana\xe2\x80\x99s bed was in the right hand room, which was lighted by a little\r\nround window close to the ceiling. As for Etienne, he shared the left\r\nhand room with the dirty clothes, enormous bundles of which lay about\r\non the floor. However, there was one disadvantage\xe2\x80\x94the Coupeaus would\r\nnot admit it at first\xe2\x80\x94but the damp ran down the walls, and it was\r\nimpossible to see clearly in the place after three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood the new shop produced a great sensation. The\r\nCoupeaus were accused of going too fast, and making too much fuss. They\r\nhad, in fact, spent the five hundred francs lent by the Goujets in\r\nfitting up the shop and in moving, without keeping sufficient to live\r\nupon for a fortnight, as they had intended doing. The morning that\r\nGervaise took down her shutters for the first time, she had just six\r\nfrancs in her purse. But that did not worry her, customers began to\r\narrive, and things seemed promising. A week later on the Saturday,\r\nbefore going to bed, she remained two hours making calculations on a\r\npiece of paper, and she awoke Coupeau to tell him, with a bright look\r\non her face, that there were hundreds and thousands of francs to be\r\nmade, if they were only careful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lorilleux all over the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy fool of a brother is seeing some funny things! All that was wanting\r\nwas that Clump-clump should go about so haughty. It becomes her well,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lorilleuxs had declared a feud to the death against Gervaise. To\r\nbegin with, they had almost died of rage during the time while the\r\nrepairs were being done to the shop. If they caught sight of the\r\npainters from a distance, they would walk on the other side of the way,\r\nand go up to their rooms with their teeth set. A blue shop for that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnobody,\xe2\x80\x9d it was enough to discourage all honest, hard-working people!\r\nBesides, the second day after the shop opened the apprentice happened\r\nto throw out a bowl of starch just at the moment when Madame Lorilleux\r\nwas passing. The zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s sister caused a great commotion in the\r\nstreet, accusing her sister-in-law of insulting her through her\r\nemployees. This broke off all relations. Now they only exchanged\r\nterrible glares when they encountered each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she leads a pretty life!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Lorilleux kept saying. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all\r\nknow where the money came from that she paid for her wretched shop! She\r\nborrowed it from the blacksmith; and he springs from a nice family too!\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t the father cut his own throat to save the guillotine the trouble\r\nof doing so? Anyhow, there was something disreputable of that sort!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bluntly accused Gervaise of flirting with Goujet. She lied\xe2\x80\x94she\r\npretended she had surprised them together one night on a seat on the\r\nexterior Boulevards. The thought of this liaison, of pleasures that her\r\nsister-in-law was no doubt enjoying, exasperated her still more,\r\nbecause of her own ugly woman\xe2\x80\x99s strict sense of propriety. Every day\r\nthe same cry came from her heart to her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she have, that wretched cripple, for people to fall in love\r\nwith her? Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t any one want me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe busied herself in endless gossiping among the neighbors. She told\r\nthem the whole story. The day the Coupeaus got married she turned up\r\nher nose at her. Oh, she had a keen nose, she could smell in advance\r\nhow it would turn out. Then, Clump-clump pretended to be so sweet, what\r\na hypocrite! She and her husband had only agreed to be Nana\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngodparents for the sake of her brother. What a bundle it had cost, that\r\nfancy christening. If Clump-clump were on her deathbed she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive her a glass of water, no matter how much she begged.\r\n\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything to do with such a shameless baggage. Little\r\nNana would always be welcome when she came up to see her godparents.\r\nThe child couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed for her mother\xe2\x80\x99s sins. But there was no\r\nuse trying to tell Coupeau anything. Any real man in his situation\r\nwould have beaten his wife and put a stop to it all. All they wanted\r\nwas for him to insist on respect for his family. _Mon Dieu_! If she,\r\nMadame Lorilleux, had acted like that, Coupeau wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so\r\ncomplacent. He would have stabbed her for sure with his shears.\r\n\r\nThe Boches, however, who sternly disapproved of quarrels in their\r\nbuilding, said that the Lorilleuxs were in the wrong. The Lorilleuxs\r\nwere no doubt respectable persons, quiet, working the whole day long,\r\nand paying their rent regularly. But, really, jealousy had driven them\r\nmad. And they were mean enough to skin an egg, real misers. They were\r\nso stingy that they\xe2\x80\x99d hide their bottle when any one came in, so as not\r\nto have to offer a glass of wine\xe2\x80\x94not regular people at all.\r\n\r\nGervaise had brought over cassis and soda water one day to drink with\r\nthe Boches. When Madame Lorilleux went by, she acted out spitting\r\nbefore the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s door. Well, after that when Madame Boche swept\r\nthe corridors on Saturdays, she always left a pile of trash before the\r\nLorilleuxs\xe2\x80\x99 door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be wondered at!\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Lorilleux would exclaim,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s always stuffing them, the gluttons! Ah! they\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nalike; but they had better not annoy me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll complain to the landlord.\r\nOnly yesterday I saw that sly old Boche chasing after Madame Gaudron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskirts. Just fancy! A woman of that age, and who has half a dozen\r\nchildren, too; it\xe2\x80\x99s positively disgusting! If I catch them at anything\r\nof the sort again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Madame Boche, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll give them both a\r\nhiding. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be something to laugh at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau continued to visit the two houses, agreeing with\r\neverybody and even managing to get asked oftener to dinner, by\r\ncomplaisantly listening one night to her daughter and the next night to\r\nher daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Lerat did not go to visit the Coupeaus because she had\r\nargued with Gervaise about a Zouave who had cut the nose of his\r\nmistress with a razor. She was on the side of the Zouave, saying it was\r\nevidence of a great passion, but without explaining further her\r\nthought. Then, she had made Madame Lorilleux even more angry by telling\r\nher that Clump-clump had called her \xe2\x80\x9cCow Tail\xe2\x80\x9d in front of fifteen or\r\ntwenty people. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Boches and all the neighbors called\r\nher now, \xe2\x80\x9cCow Tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise remained calm and cheerful among all these goings-on. She\r\noften stood by the door of her shop greeting friends who passed by with\r\na nod and a smile. It was her pleasure to take a moment between batches\r\nof ironing to enjoy the street and take pride in her own stretch of\r\nsidewalk.\r\n\r\nShe felt that the Rue de la Goutte d\xe2\x80\x99Or was hers, and the neighboring\r\nstreets, and the whole neighborhood. As she stood there, with her\r\nblonde hair slightly damp from the heat of the shop, she would look\r\nleft and right, taking in the people, the buildings, and the sky. To\r\nthe left Rue de la Goutte d\xe2\x80\x99Or was peaceful and almost empty, like a\r\ncountry town with women idling in their doorways. While, to the right,\r\nonly a short distance away, Rue des Poissonniers had a noisy throng of\r\npeople and vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe stretch of gutter before her own shop became very important in her\r\nmind. It was like a wide river which she longed to see neat and clean.\r\nIt was a lively river, colored by the dye shop with the most fanciful\r\nof hues which contrasted with the black mud beside it.\r\n\r\nThen there were the shops: a large grocery with a display of dried\r\nfruits protected by mesh nets; a shop selling work clothes which had\r\nwhite tunics and blue smocks hanging before it with arms that waved at\r\nthe slightest breeze. Cats were purring on the counters of the fruit\r\nstore and the tripe shop. Madame Vigouroux, the coal dealer next door,\r\nreturned her greetings. She was a plump, short woman with bright eyes\r\nin a dark face who was always joking with the men while standing at her\r\ndoorway. Her shop was decorated in imitation of a rustic chalet. The\r\nneighbors on the other side were a mother and daughter, the Cudorges.\r\nThe umbrella sellers kept their door closed and never came out to\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nGervaise always looked across the road, too, through the wide carriage\r\nentrance of the windowless wall opposite her, at the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforge. The courtyard was cluttered with vans and carts. Inscribed on\r\nthe wall was the word \xe2\x80\x9cBlacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the wall between the small shops selling scrap iron\r\nand fried potatoes was a watchmaker. He wore a frock coat and was\r\nalways very neat. His cuckoo clocks could be heard in chorus against\r\nthe background noise of the street and the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s rhythmic\r\nclanging.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood in general thought Gervaise very nice. There was, it\r\nis true, a good deal of scandal related regarding her; but everyone\r\nadmired her large eyes, small mouth and beautiful white teeth. In short\r\nshe was a pretty blonde, and had it not been for her crippled leg she\r\nmight have ranked amongst the comeliest. She was now in her\r\ntwenty-eighth year, and had grown considerably plumper. Her fine\r\nfeatures were becoming puffy, and her gestures were assuming a pleasant\r\nindolence.\r\n\r\nAt times she occasionally seemed to forget herself on the edge of a\r\nchair, whilst she waited for her iron to heat, smiling vaguely and with\r\nan expression of greedy joy upon her face. She was becoming fond of\r\ngood living, everybody said so; but that was not a very grave fault,\r\nbut rather the contrary. When one earns sufficient to be able to buy\r\ngood food, one would be foolish to eat potato parings. All the more so\r\nas she continued to work very hard, slaving to please her customers,\r\nsitting up late at night after the place was closed, whenever there was\r\nanything urgent.\r\n\r\nShe was lucky as all her neighbors said; everything prospered with her.\r\nShe did the washing for all the house\xe2\x80\x94M. Madinier, Mademoiselle\r\nRemanjou, the Boches. She even secured some of the customers of her old\r\nemployer, Madame Fauconnier, Parisian ladies living in the Rue du\r\nFaubourg-Poissonniere. As early as the third week she was obliged to\r\nengage two workwomen, Madame Putois and tall Clemence, the girl who\r\nused to live on the sixth floor; counting her apprentice, that little\r\nsquint-eyed Augustine, who was as ugly as a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s behind, that made\r\nthree persons in her employ. Others would certainly have lost their\r\nheads at such a piece of good fortune. It was excusable for her to\r\nslack a little on Monday after drudging all through the week. Besides,\r\nit was necessary to her. She would have had no courage left, and would\r\nhave expected to see the shirts iron themselves, if she had not been\r\nable to dress up in some pretty thing.\r\n\r\nGervaise was always so amiable, meek as a lamb, sweet as sugar. There\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t any one she disliked except Madame Lorilleux. While she was\r\nenjoying a good meal and coffee, she could be indulgent and forgive\r\neverybody saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to forgive each other\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x94unless we\r\nwant to live like savages.\xe2\x80\x9d Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t all her dreams come true? She\r\nremembered her old dream: to have a job, enough bread to eat and a\r\ncorner in which to sleep, to bring up her children, not to be beaten,\r\nand to die in her own bed. She had everything she wanted now and more\r\nthan she had ever expected. She laughed, thinking of delaying dying in\r\nher own bed as long as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was to Coupeau especially that Gervaise behaved nicely. Never an\r\nangry word, never a complaint behind her husband\xe2\x80\x99s back. The\r\nzinc-worker had at length resumed work; and as the job he was engaged\r\non was at the other side of Paris, she gave him every morning forty\r\nsous for his luncheon, his glass of wine and his tobacco. Only, two\r\ndays out of every six, Coupeau would stop on the way, spend the forty\r\nsous in drink with a friend, and return home to lunch, with some\r\ncock-and-bull story. Once even he did not take the trouble to go far;\r\nhe treated himself, My-Boots and three others to a regular\r\nfeast\xe2\x80\x94snails, roast meat, and some sealed bottles of wine\xe2\x80\x94at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapuchin,\xe2\x80\x9d on the Barriere de la Chapelle. Then, as his forty sous\r\nwere not sufficient, he had sent the waiter to his wife with the bill\r\nand the information that he was in pawn. She laughed and shrugged her\r\nshoulders. Where was the harm if her old man amused himself a bit? You\r\nmust give men a long rein if you want to live peaceably at home. From\r\none word to another, one soon arrived at blows. _Mon Dieu_! It was easy\r\nto understand. Coupeau still suffered from his leg; besides, he was led\r\nastray. He was obliged to do as the others did, or else he would be\r\nthought a cheap skate. And it was really a matter of no consequence. If\r\nhe came home a bit elevated, he went to bed, and two hours afterwards\r\nhe was all right again.\r\n\r\nIt was now the warm time of the year. One June afternoon, a Saturday\r\nwhen there was a lot of work to get through, Gervaise herself had piled\r\nthe coke into the stove, around which ten irons were heating, whilst a\r\nrumbling sound issued from the chimney. At that hour the sun was\r\nshining full on the shop front, and the pavement reflected the heat\r\nwaves, causing all sorts of quaint shadows to dance over the ceiling,\r\nand that blaze of light which assumed a bluish tinge from the color of\r\nthe paper on the shelves and against the window, was almost blinding in\r\nthe intensity with which it shone over the ironing-table, like a golden\r\ndust shaken among the fine linen. The atmosphere was stifling. The shop\r\ndoor was thrown wide open, but not a breath of air entered; the clothes\r\nwhich were hung up on brass wires to dry, steamed and became as stiff\r\nas shavings in less than three quarters of an hour. For some little\r\nwhile past an oppressive silence had reigned in that furnace-like heat,\r\ninterrupted only by the smothered sound of the banging down of the\r\nirons on the thick blanket covered with calico.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s enough to melt one! We might have to\r\ntake off our chemises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the floor, in front of a basin, starching some\r\nthings. Her sleeves were rolled up and her camisole was slipping down\r\nher shoulders. Little curls of golden hair were stuck to her skin by\r\nperspiration. She carefully dipped caps, shirt-fronts, entire\r\npetticoats, and the trimmings of women\xe2\x80\x99s drawers into the milky water.\r\nThen she rolled the things up and placed them at the bottom of a square\r\nbasket, after dipping her hand in a pail and shaking it over the\r\nportions of the shirts and drawers which she had not starched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis basketful\xe2\x80\x99s for you, Madame Putois,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook sharp, now!\r\nIt dries at once, and will want doing all over again in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Putois, a thin little woman of forty-five, was ironing. Though\r\nshe was buttoned up in an old chestnut-colored dress, there was not a\r\ndrop of perspiration to be seen. She had not even taken her cap off, a\r\nblack cap trimmed with green ribbons turned partly yellow. And she\r\nstood perfectly upright in front of the ironing-table, which was too\r\nhigh for her, sticking out her elbows, and moving her iron with the\r\njerky evolutions of a puppet. On a sudden she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no! Mademoiselle Clemence, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take your camisole off. You\r\nknow I don\xe2\x80\x99t like such indecencies. Whilst you\xe2\x80\x99re about it, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter show everything. There\xe2\x80\x99s already three men over the way stopping\r\nto look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTall Clemence called her an old beast between her teeth. She was\r\nsuffocating; she might certainly make herself comfortable; everyone was\r\nnot gifted with a skin as dry as touchwood. Besides no one could see\r\nanything; and she held up her arms, whilst her opulent bosom almost\r\nripped her chemise, and her shoulders were bursting through the straps.\r\nAt the rate she was going, Clemence was not likely to have any marrow\r\nleft in her bones long before she was thirty years old. Mornings after\r\nbig parties she was unable to feel the ground she trod upon, and fell\r\nasleep over her work, whilst her head and her stomach seemed as though\r\nstuffed full of rags. But she was kept on all the same, for no other\r\nworkwoman could iron a shirt with her style. Shirts were her specialty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is mine, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, tapping her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t bite; it hurts nobody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClemence, put your wrapper on again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Putois is\r\nright, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t decent. People will begin to take my house for what it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo tall Clemence dressed herself again, grumbling the while. \xe2\x80\x9c_Mon\r\nDieu!_ There\xe2\x80\x99s prudery for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she vented her rage on the apprentice, that squint-eyed Augustine\r\nwho was ironing some stockings and handkerchiefs beside her. She\r\njostled her and pushed her with her elbow; but Augustine who was of a\r\nsurly disposition, and slyly spiteful in the way of an animal and a\r\ndrudge, spat on the back of the other\xe2\x80\x99s dress just out of revenge,\r\nwithout being seen. Gervaise, during this incident, had commenced a cap\r\nbelonging to Madame Boche, which she intended to take great pains with.\r\nShe had prepared some boiled starch to make it look new again. She was\r\ngently passing a little iron rounded at both ends over the inside of\r\nthe crown of the cap, when a bony-looking woman entered the shop, her\r\nface covered with red blotches and her skirts sopping wet. It was a\r\nwasherwoman who employed three assistants at the wash-house in the Rue\r\nde la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come too soon, Madame Bijard!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you to\r\ncall this evening. I\xe2\x80\x99m too busy to attend to you now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as the washerwoman began lamenting and fearing that she would not\r\nbe able to put all the things to soak that day, she consented to give\r\nher the dirty clothes at once. They went to fetch the bundles in the\r\nleft hand room where Etienne slept, and returned with enormous armfuls\r\nwhich they piled up on the floor at the back of the shop. The sorting\r\nlasted a good half hour. Gervaise made heaps all round her, throwing\r\nthe shirts in one, the chemises in another, the handkerchiefs, the\r\nsocks, the dish-cloths in others. Whenever she came across anything\r\nbelonging to a new customer, she marked it with a cross in red cotton\r\nthread so as to know it again. And from all this dirty linen which they\r\nwere throwing about there issued an offensive odor in the warm\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! La, la. What a stench!\xe2\x80\x9d said Clemence, holding her nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course there is! If it were clean they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send it to us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nquietly explained Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt smells as one would expect it to,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all! We said fourteen chemises, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we, Madame Bijard?\r\nFifteen, sixteen, seventeen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she continued counting aloud. Used to this kind of thing she\r\nevinced no disgust. She thrust her bare pink arms deep into the piles\r\nof laundry: shirts yellow with grime, towels stiff from dirty dish\r\nwater, socks threadbare and eaten away by sweat. The strong odor which\r\nslapped her in the face as she sorted the piles of clothes made her\r\nfeel drowsy. She seemed to be intoxicating herself with this stench of\r\nhumanity as she sat on the edge of a stool, bending far over, smiling\r\nvaguely, her eyes slightly misty. It was as if her laziness was started\r\nby a kind of smothering caused by the dirty clothes which poisoned the\r\nair in the shop. Just as she was shaking out a child\xe2\x80\x99s dirty diaper,\r\nCoupeau came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d he stuttered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a sun! It shines full on your head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe zinc-worker caught hold of the ironing-table to save himself from\r\nfalling. It was the first time he had been so drunk. Until then he had\r\nsometimes come home slightly tipsy, but nothing more. This time,\r\nhowever, he had a black eye, just a friendly slap he had run up against\r\nin a playful moment. His curly hair, already streaked with grey, must\r\nhave dusted a corner in some low wineshop, for a cobweb was hanging to\r\none of his locks over the back of his neck. He was still as attractive\r\nas ever, though his features were rather drawn and aged, and his under\r\njaw projected more; but he was always lively, as he would sometimes\r\nsay, with a complexion to be envied by a duchess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just explain it to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, addressing Gervaise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Celery-Root, you know him, the bloke with a wooden leg. Well,\r\nas he was going back to his native place, he wanted to treat us. Oh! We\r\nwere all right, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for that devil of a sun. In the\r\nstreet everybody looks shaky. Really, all the world\xe2\x80\x99s drunk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as tall Clemence laughed at his thinking that the people in the\r\nstreet were drunk, he was himself seized with an intense fit of gaiety\r\nwhich almost strangled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at them! The blessed tipplers! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they funny?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not their fault. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sun that\xe2\x80\x99s causing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the shop laughed, even Madame Putois, who did not like drunkards.\r\nThat squint-eyed Augustine was cackling like a hen, suffocating with\r\nher mouth wide open. Gervaise, however, suspected Coupeau of not having\r\ncome straight home, but of having passed an hour with the Lorilleuxs\r\nwho were always filling his head with unpleasant ideas. When he swore\r\nhe had not been near them she laughed also, full of indulgence and not\r\neven reproaching him with having wasted another day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ What nonsense he does talk,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does he\r\nmanage to say such stupid things?\xe2\x80\x9d Then in a maternal tone of voice she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cNow go to bed, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? You see we\xe2\x80\x99re busy; you\xe2\x80\x99re in our\r\nway. That makes thirty-two handkerchiefs, Madame Bijard; and two more,\r\nthirty-four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Coupeau was not sleepy. He stood there wagging his body from side\r\nto side like the pendulum of a clock and chuckling in an obstinate and\r\nteasing manner. Gervaise, wanting to finish with Madame Bijard, called\r\nto Clemence to count the laundry while she made the list. Tall Clemence\r\nmade a dirty remark about every item that she touched. She commented on\r\nthe customers\xe2\x80\x99 misfortunes and their bedroom adventures. She had a\r\nwash-house joke for every rip or stain that passed through her hands.\r\nAugustine pretended that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, but her ears were wide\r\nopen. Madame Putois compressed her lips, thinking it a disgrace to say\r\nsuch things in front of Coupeau. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a man\xe2\x80\x99s business to have\r\nanything to do with dirty linen. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not done among decent\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nGervaise, serious and her mind fully occupied with what she was about,\r\ndid not seem to notice. As she wrote she gave a glance to each article\r\nas it passed before her, so as to recognize it; and she never made a\r\nmistake; she guessed the owner\xe2\x80\x99s name just by the look or the color.\r\nThose napkins belonged to the Goujets, that was evident; they had not\r\nbeen used to wipe out frying-pans. That pillow-case certainly came from\r\nthe Boches on account of the pomatum with which Madame Boche always\r\nsmeared her things. There was no need to put your nose close to the\r\nflannel vests of Monsieur Madinier; his skin was so oily that it\r\nclogged up his woolens.\r\n\r\nShe knew many peculiarities, the cleanliness of some, the ragged\r\nunderclothes of neighborhood ladies who appeared on the streets in silk\r\ndresses; how many items each family soiled weekly; the way some\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s garments were always torn at the same spot. Oh, she had many\r\ntales to tell. For instance, the chemises of Mademoiselle Remanjou\r\nprovided material for endless comments: they wore out at the top first\r\nbecause the old maid had bony, sharp shoulders; and they were never\r\nreally dirty, proving that you dry up by her age, like a stick of wood\r\nout of which it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to squeeze a drop of anything. It was thus that\r\nat every sorting of the dirty linen in the shop they undressed the\r\nwhole neighborhood of the Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, here\xe2\x80\x99s something luscious!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clemence, opening another\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\nGervaise, suddenly seized with a great repugnance, drew back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Gaudron\xe2\x80\x99s bundle?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll no longer wash for her, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind some excuse. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not more particular than another. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhandled some most disgusting linen in my time; but really, that lot I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stomach. What can the woman do to get her things into such a\r\nstate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she requested Clemence to look sharp. But the girl continued her\r\nremarks, thrusting the clothes sullenly about her, with complaints on\r\nthe soiled caps she waved like triumphal banners of filth. Meanwhile\r\nthe heaps around Gervaise had grown higher. Still seated on the edge of\r\nthe stool, she was now disappearing between the petticoats and\r\nchemises. In front of her were the sheets, the table cloths, a\r\nveritable mass of dirtiness.\r\n\r\nShe seemed even rosier and more languid than usual within this\r\nspreading sea of soiled laundry. She had regained her composure,\r\nforgetting Madame Gaudron\xe2\x80\x99s laundry, stirring the various piles of\r\nclothing to make sure there had been no mistake in sorting. Squint-eyed\r\nAugustine had just stuffed the stove so full of coke that its cast-iron\r\nsides were bright red. The sun was shining obliquely on the window; the\r\nshop was in a blaze. Then, Coupeau, whom the great heat intoxicated all\r\nthe more, was seized with a sudden fit of tenderness. He advanced\r\ntowards Gervaise with open arms and deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a good wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cI must kiss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he caught his foot in the garments which barred the way and nearly\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nuisance you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise without getting angry. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep\r\nstill, we\xe2\x80\x99re nearly done now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, he wanted to kiss her. He must do so because he loved her so much.\r\nWhilst he stuttered he tried to get round the heap of petticoats and\r\nstumbled against the pile of chemises; then as he obstinately persisted\r\nhis feet caught together and he fell flat, his nose in the midst of the\r\ndish-cloths. Gervaise, beginning to lose her temper pushed him, saying\r\nthat he was mixing all the things up. But Clemence and even Madame\r\nPutois maintained that she was wrong. It was very nice of him after\r\nall. He wanted to kiss her. She might very well let herself be kissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re lucky, you are, Madame Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Bijard, whose\r\ndrunkard of a husband, a locksmith, was nearly beating her to death\r\neach evening when he came in. \xe2\x80\x9cIf my old man was like that when he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad a drop, it would be a real pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had calmed down and was already regretting her hastiness. She\r\nhelped Coupeau up on his legs again. Then she offered her cheek with a\r\nsmile. But the zinc-worker, without caring a button for the other\r\npeople being present, seized her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not for the sake of saying so,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your dirty\r\nlinen stinks tremendously! Still, I love you all the same, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off, you\xe2\x80\x99re tickling me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, laughing the louder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\na great silly you are! How can you be so absurd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had caught hold of her and would not let her go. She gradually\r\nabandoned herself to him, dizzy from the slight faintness caused by the\r\nheap of clothes and not minding Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s foul-smelling breath. The\r\nlong kiss they exchanged on each other\xe2\x80\x99s mouths in the midst of the\r\nfilth of the laundress\xe2\x80\x99s trade was perhaps the first tumble in the slow\r\ndownfall of their life together.\r\n\r\nMadame Bijard had meanwhile been tying the laundry up into bundles and\r\ntalking about her daughter, Eulalie, who at two was as smart as a grown\r\nwoman. She could be left by herself; she never cried or played with\r\nmatches. Finally Madame Bijard took the laundry away a bundle at a\r\ntime, her face splotched with purple and her tall form bent under the\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis heat is becoming unbearable, we\xe2\x80\x99re roasting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise,\r\nwiping her face before returning to Madame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s cap.\r\n\r\nThey talked of boxing Augustine\xe2\x80\x99s ears when they saw that the stove was\r\nred-hot. The irons, also, were getting in the same condition. She must\r\nhave the very devil in her body! One could not turn one\xe2\x80\x99s back a moment\r\nwithout her being up to some of her tricks. Now they would have to wait\r\na quarter of an hour before they would be able to use their irons.\r\nGervaise covered the fire with two shovelfuls of cinders. Then she\r\nthought to hang some sheets on the brass wires near the ceiling to\r\nserve as curtains to keep out the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThings were now better in the shop. The temperature was still high, but\r\nyou could imagine it was cooler. Footsteps could still be heard outside\r\nbut you were free to make yourself comfortable. Clemence removed her\r\ncamisole again. Coupeau still refused to go to bed, so they allowed him\r\nto stay, but he had to promise to be quiet in a corner, for they were\r\nvery busy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever has that vermin done with my little iron?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gervaise,\r\nspeaking of Augustine.\r\n\r\nThey were for ever seeking the little iron, which they found in the\r\nmost out-of-the-way places, where the apprentice, so they said, hid it\r\nout of spite. Gervaise could now finish Madame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s cap. First she\r\nroughly smoothed the lace, spreading it out with her hand, and then she\r\nstraightened it up by light strokes of the iron. It had a very fancy\r\nborder consisting of narrow puffs alternating with insertions of\r\nembroidery. She was working on it silently and conscientiously, ironing\r\nthe puffs and insertions.\r\n\r\nSilence prevailed for a time. Nothing was to be heard except the soft\r\nthud of irons on the ironing pad. On both sides of the huge rectangular\r\ntable Gervaise, her two employees, and the apprentice were bending\r\nover, slaving at their tasks with rounded shoulders, their arms moving\r\nincessantly. Each had a flat brick blackened by hot irons near her. A\r\nsoup plate filled with clean water was on the middle of the table with\r\na moistening rag and a small brush soaking in it.\r\n\r\nA bouquet of large white lilies bloomed in what had once been a\r\nbrandied cherry jar. Its cluster of snowy flowers suggested a corner of\r\na royal garden. Madame Putois had begun the basket that Gervaise had\r\nbrought to her filled with towels, wrappers, cuffs and underdrawers.\r\nAugustine was dawdling with the stockings and washcloths, gazing into\r\nthe air, seemingly fascinated by a large fly that was buzzing around.\r\nClemence had done thirty-four men\xe2\x80\x99s shirts so far that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways wine, never spirits!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly said the zinc-worker, who felt\r\nthe necessity of making this declaration. \xe2\x80\x9cSpirits make me drunk, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave none of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClemence took an iron from the stove with her leather holder in which a\r\npiece of sheet iron was inserted, and held it up to her cheek to see\r\nhow hot it was. She rubbed it on her brick, wiped it on a piece of rag\r\nhanging from her waist-band and started on her thirty-fifth shirt,\r\nfirst of all ironing the shoulders and the sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! Monsieur Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d said she after a minute or two, \xe2\x80\x9ca little\r\nglass of brandy isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad. It sets me going. Besides, the sooner you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmerry, the jollier it is. Oh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t make any mistake; I know that I\r\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t make old bones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nuisance you are with your funeral ideas!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Madame\r\nPutois who did not like hearing people talk of anything sad.\r\n\r\nCoupeau had arisen and was becoming angry thinking that he had been\r\naccused of drinking brandy. He swore on his own head and on the heads\r\nof his wife and child that there was not a drop of brandy in his veins.\r\nAnd he went up to Clemence and blew in her face so that she might smell\r\nhis breath. Then he began to giggle because her bare shoulders were\r\nright under his nose. He thought maybe he could see more. Clemence,\r\nhaving folded over the back of the shirt and ironed it on both sides,\r\nwas now working on the cuffs and collar. However, as he was shoving\r\nagainst her, he caused her to make a wrinkle, obliging her to reach for\r\nthe brush soaking in the soup plate to smooth it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cdo make him leave off bothering me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave her alone; it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid of you to go on like that,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly\r\nobserved Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a hurry, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were in a hurry, well! What? It was not his fault. He was doing no\r\nharm. He was not touching, he was only looking. Was it no longer\r\nallowed to look at the beautiful things that God had made? All the\r\nsame, she had precious fine arms, that artful Clemence! She might\r\nexhibit herself for two sous and nobody would have to regret his money.\r\nThe girl allowed him to go on, laughing at these coarse compliments of\r\na drunken man. And she soon commenced joking with him. He chuffed her\r\nabout the shirts. So she was always doing shirts? Why yes, she\r\npractically lived in them. _Mon Dieu!_ She knew them pretty well.\r\nHundreds and hundreds of them had passed through her hands. Just about\r\nevery man in the neighborhood was wearing her handiwork on his body.\r\nHer shoulders were shaking with laughter through all this, but she\r\nmanaged to continue ironing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the banter!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing harder than ever.\r\n\r\nThat squint-eyed Augustine almost burst, the joke seemed to her so\r\nfunny. The others bullied her. There was a brat for you who laughed at\r\nwords she ought not to understand! Clemence handed her her iron; the\r\napprentice finished up the irons on the stockings and the dish-cloths\r\nwhen they were not hot enough for the starched things. But she took\r\nhold of this one so clumsily that she made herself a cuff in the form\r\nof a long burn on the wrist. And she sobbed and accused Clemence of\r\nhaving burnt her on purpose. The latter who had gone to fetch a very\r\nhot iron for the shirt-front consoled her at once by threatening to\r\niron her two ears if she did not leave off. Then she placed a piece of\r\nflannel under the front and slowly passed the iron over it giving the\r\nstarch time to show up and dry. The shirt-front became as stiff and as\r\nshiny as cardboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy golly!\xe2\x80\x9d swore Coupeau, who was treading behind her with the\r\nobstinacy of a drunkard.\r\n\r\nHe raised himself up with a shrill laugh that resembled a pulley in\r\nwant of grease. Clemence, leaning heavily over the ironing-table, her\r\nwrists bent in, her elbows sticking out and wide apart was bending her\r\nneck in a last effort; and all her muscles swelled, her shoulders rose\r\nwith the slow play of the muscles beating beneath the soft skin, her\r\nbreasts heaved, wet with perspiration in the rosy shadow of the half\r\nopen chemise. Then Coupeau thrust out his hands, trying to touch her\r\nbare flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame! Madame!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Clemence, \xe2\x80\x9cdo make him leave off! I shall go\r\naway if it continues. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be intimated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise glanced over just as her husband\xe2\x80\x99s hands began to explore\r\ninside the chemise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Coupeau, you\xe2\x80\x99re too foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a vexed air, as\r\nthough she were scolding a child who persisted in eating his jam\r\nwithout bread. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go to bed, Monsieur Coupeau; it will be far better,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMadame Putois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Well,\xe2\x80\x9d stuttered he, without ceasing to chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\nprecious particular! So one mustn\xe2\x80\x99t amuse oneself now? Women, I know\r\nhow to handle them; I\xe2\x80\x99ll only kiss them, no more. One admires a lady,\r\nyou know, and wants to show it. And, besides, when one displays one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoods, it\xe2\x80\x99s that one may make one\xe2\x80\x99s choice, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Why does the tall\r\nblonde show everything she\xe2\x80\x99s got? It\xe2\x80\x99s not decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd turning towards Clemence, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my lovely, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nwrong to be to very insolent. If it\xe2\x80\x99s because there are others here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was unable to continue. Gervaise very calmly seized hold of him\r\nwith one hand, and placed the other on his mouth. He struggled, just by\r\nway of a joke, whilst she pushed him to the back of the shop, towards\r\nthe bedroom. He got his mouth free and said that he was willing to go\r\nto bed, but that the tall blonde must come and warm his feet.\r\n\r\nThen Gervaise could be heard taking off his shoes. She removed his\r\nclothes too, bullying him in a motherly way. He burst out laughing\r\nafter she had removed his trousers and kicked about, pretending that\r\nshe was tickling him. At last she tucked him in carefully like a child.\r\nWas he comfortable now? But he did not answer; he called to Clemence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, my lovely, I\xe2\x80\x99m here, and waiting for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise went back into the shop, the squint-eyed Augustine was\r\nbeing properly chastised by Clemence because of a dirty iron that\r\nMadame Putois had used and which had caused her to soil a camisole.\r\nClemence, in defending herself for not having cleaned her iron, blamed\r\nAugustine, swearing that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hers, in spite of the spot of burned\r\nstarch still clinging to the bottom. The apprentice, outraged at the\r\ninjustice, openly spat on the front of Clemence\xe2\x80\x99s dress, earning a slap\r\nfor her boldness. Now, as Augustine went about cleaning the iron, she\r\nsaved up her spit and each time she passed Clemence spat on her back\r\nand laughed to herself.\r\n\r\nGervaise continued with the lace of Madame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s cap. In the sudden\r\ncalm which ensued, one could hear Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s husky voice issuing from\r\nthe depths of the bedroom. He was still jolly, and was laughing to\r\nhimself as he uttered bits of phrases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid she is, my wife! How stupid of her to put me to bed!\r\nReally, it\xe2\x80\x99s too absurd, in the middle of the day, when one isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, all on a sudden, he snored. Then Gervaise gave a sigh of relief,\r\nhappy in knowing that he was at length quiet, and sleeping off his\r\nintoxication on two good mattresses. And she spoke out in the silence,\r\nin a slow and continuous voice, without taking her eyes off her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t his reason, one can\xe2\x80\x99t be angry. Were I to be harsh\r\nwith him, it would be of no use. I prefer to agree with him and get him\r\nto bed; then, at least, it\xe2\x80\x99s over at once and I\xe2\x80\x99m quiet. Besides, he\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t ill-natured, he loves me very much. You could see that just a\r\nmoment ago when he was desperate to give me a kiss. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite nice\r\nof him. There are plenty of men, you know, who after drinking a bit\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t come straight home but stay out chasing women. Oh, he may fool\r\naround with the women in the shop, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to anything.\r\nClemence, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t feel insulted. You know how it is when a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad too much to drink. He could do anything and not even remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke composedly, not at all angry, being quite used to Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsprees and not holding them against him. A silence settled down for a\r\nwhile when she stopped talking. There was a lot of work to get done.\r\nThey figured they would have to keep at it until eleven, working as\r\nfast as they could. Now that they were undisturbed, all of them were\r\npounding away. Bare arms were moving back and forth, showing glimpses\r\nof pink among the whiteness of the laundry.\r\n\r\nMore coke had been put into the stove and the sunlight slanted in\r\nbetween the sheets onto the stove. You could see the heat rising up\r\nthrough the rays of the sun. It became so stifling that Augustine ran\r\nout of spit and was forced to lick her lips. The room smelled of the\r\nheat and of the working women. The white lilies in the jar were\r\nbeginning to fade, yet they still exuded a pure and strong perfume.\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s heavy snores were heard like the regular ticking of a huge\r\nclock, setting the tempo for the heavy labor in the shop.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of his carouses, the zinc-worker always had a headache, a\r\nsplitting headache which kept him all day with his hair uncombed, his\r\nbreath offensive, and his mouth all swollen and askew. He got up late\r\non those days, not shaking the fleas off till about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock; and\r\nhe would hang about the shop, unable to make up his mind to start off\r\nto his work. It was another day lost. In the morning he would complain\r\nthat his legs bent like pieces of thread, and would call himself a\r\ngreat fool to guzzle to such an extent, as it broke one\xe2\x80\x99s constitution.\r\nThen, too, there were a lot of lazy bums who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let you go and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d get to drinking more in spite of yourself. No, no, no more for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch he would always begin to perk up and deny that he had been\r\nreally drunk the night before. Maybe just a bit lit up. He was rock\r\nsolid and able to drink anything he wanted without even blinking an\r\neye.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thoroughly badgered the workwomen, Gervaise would give him\r\ntwenty sous to clear out. And off he would go to buy his tobacco at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Civet,\xe2\x80\x9d in the Rue des Poissonniers, where he generally took a\r\nplum in brandy whenever he met a friend. Then, he spent the rest of the\r\ntwenty sous at old Francois\xe2\x80\x99s, at the corner of the Rue de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, where there was a famous wine, quite young, which tickled\r\nyour gullet. This was an old-fashioned place with a low ceiling. There\r\nwas a smoky room to one side where soup was served. He would stay there\r\nuntil evening drinking because there was an understanding that he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay right away and they would never send the bill to his\r\nwife. Besides he was a jolly fellow, who would never do the least\r\nharm\xe2\x80\x94a chap who loved a spree sure enough, and who colored his nose in\r\nhis turn but in a nice manner, full of contempt for those pigs of men\r\nwho have succumbed to alcohol, and whom one never sees sober! He always\r\nwent home as gay and as gallant as a lark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your lover been?\xe2\x80\x9d he would sometimes ask Gervaise by way of\r\nteasing her. \xe2\x80\x9cOne never sees him now; I must go and rout him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lover was Goujet. He avoided, in fact, calling too often for fear\r\nof being in the way, and also of causing people to talk. Yet he\r\nfrequently found a pretext, such as bringing the washing; and he would\r\npass no end of time on the pavement in front of the shop. There was a\r\ncorner right at the back in which he liked to sit, without moving for\r\nhours, and smoke his short pipe. Once every ten days, in the evening\r\nafter his dinner, he would venture there and take up his favorite\r\nposition. And he was no talker, his mouth almost seemed sewn up, as he\r\nsat with his eyes fixed on Gervaise, and only removed his pipe to laugh\r\nat everything she said. When they were working late on a Saturday he\r\nwould stay on, and appeared to amuse himself more than if he had gone\r\nto a theatre.\r\n\r\nSometimes the women stayed in the shop ironing until three in the\r\nmorning. A lamp hung from the ceiling and spread a brilliant light\r\nmaking the linen look like fresh snow. The apprentice would put up the\r\nshop shutters, but since these July nights were scorching hot, the door\r\nwould be left open. The later the hour the more casual the women became\r\nwith their clothes while trying to be comfortable. The lamplight\r\nflecked their rosy skin with gold specks, especially Gervaise who was\r\nso pleasantly rounded.\r\n\r\nOn these nights Goujet would be overcome by the heat from the stove and\r\nthe odor of linen steaming under the hot irons. He would drift into a\r\nsort of giddiness, his thinking slowed and his eyes obsessed by these\r\nhurrying women as their naked arms moved back and forth, working far\r\ninto the night to have the neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s best clothes ready for\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nEverything around the laundry was slumbering, settled into sleep for\r\nthe night. Midnight rang, then one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, then two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There\r\nwere no vehicles or pedestrians. In the dark and deserted street, only\r\ntheir shop door let out any light. Once in a while, footsteps would be\r\nheard and a man would pass the shop. As he crossed the path of light he\r\nwould stretch his neck to look in, startled by the sound of the\r\nthudding irons, and carry with him the quick glimpse of bare-shouldered\r\nlaundresses immersed in a rosy mist.\r\n\r\nGoujet, seeing that Gervaise did not know what to do with Etienne, and\r\nwishing to deliver him from Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s kicks, had engaged him to go and\r\nblow the bellows at the factory where he worked. The profession of\r\nbolt-maker, if not one to be proud of on account of the dirt of the\r\nforge and of the monotony of constantly hammering on pieces of iron of\r\na similar kind, was nevertheless a well paid one, at which ten and even\r\ntwelve francs a day could be earned. The youngster, who was then twelve\r\nyears old, would soon be able to go in for it, if the calling was to\r\nhis liking. And Etienne had thus become another link between the\r\nlaundress and the blacksmith. The latter would bring the child home and\r\nspeak of his good conduct. Everyone laughingly said that Goujet was\r\nsmitten with Gervaise. She knew it, and blushed like a young girl, the\r\nflush of modesty coloring her cheeks with the bright tints of an apple.\r\nThe poor fellow, he was never any trouble! He never made a bold gesture\r\nor an indelicate remark. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t find many men like him. Gervaise\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit it, but she derived a great deal of pleasure from\r\nbeing adored like this. Whenever a problem arose she thought\r\nimmediately of the blacksmith and was consoled. There was never any\r\nawkward tension when they were alone together. They just looked at each\r\nother and smiled happily with no need to talk. It was a very sensible\r\nkind of affection.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer, Nana quite upset the household. She was\r\nsix years old and promised to be a thorough good-for-nothing. So as not\r\nto have her always under her feet her mother took her every morning to\r\na little school in the Rue Polonceau kept by Mademoiselle Josse. She\r\nfastened her playfellows\xe2\x80\x99 dresses together behind, she filled the\r\nschool-mistress\xe2\x80\x99s snuff-box with ashes, and invented other tricks much\r\nless decent which could not be mentioned. Twice Mademoiselle Josse\r\nexpelled her and then took her back again so as not to lose the six\r\nfrancs a month. Directly lessons were over Nana avenged herself for\r\nhaving been kept in by making an infernal noise under the porch and in\r\nthe courtyard where the ironers, whose ears could not stand the racket,\r\nsent her to play. There she would meet Pauline, the Boches\xe2\x80\x99 daughter,\r\nand Victor, the son of Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s old employer\xe2\x80\x94a big booby of ten who\r\ndelighted in playing with very little girls. Madame Fauconnier who had\r\nnot quarreled with the Coupeaus would herself send her son. In the\r\nhouse, too, there was an extraordinary swarm of brats, flights of\r\nchildren who rolled down the four staircases at all hours of the day\r\nand alighted on the pavement of the courtyard like troops of noisy\r\npillaging sparrows. Madame Gaudron was responsible for nine of them,\r\nall with uncombed hair, runny noses, hand-me-down clothes, saggy\r\nstockings and ripped jackets. Another woman on the sixth floor had\r\nseven of them. This hoard that only got their faces washed when it\r\nrained were in all shapes and sizes, fat, thin, big and barely out of\r\nthe cradle.\r\n\r\nNana reigned supreme over this host of urchins; she ordered about girls\r\ntwice her own size, and only deigned to relinquish a little of her\r\npower in favor of Pauline and Victor, intimate confidants who enforced\r\nher commands. This precious chit was for ever wanting to play at being\r\nmamma, undressing the smallest ones to dress them again, insisting on\r\nexamining the others all over, messing them about and exercising the\r\ncapricious despotism of a grown-up person with a vicious disposition.\r\nUnder her leadership they got up tricks for which they should have been\r\nwell spanked. The troop paddled in the colored water from the dyer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand emerged from it with legs stained blue or red as high as the knees;\r\nthen off it flew to the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s where it purloined nails and\r\nfilings and started off again to alight in the midst of the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshavings, enormous heaps of shavings, which delighted it immensely and\r\nin which it rolled head over heels exposing their behinds.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard was her kingdom. It echoed with the clatter of little\r\nshoes as they stampeded back and forth with piercing cries. On some\r\ndays the courtyard was too small for them and the troop would dash down\r\ninto the cellar, race up a staircase, run along a corridor, then dash\r\nup another staircase and follow another corridor for hours. They never\r\ngot tired of their yelling and clambering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t they abominable, those little toads?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Boche.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, people can have but very little to do to have time to get so\r\nmany brats. And yet they complain of having no bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoche said that children pushed up out of poverty like mushrooms out of\r\nmanure. All day long his wife was screaming at them and chasing them\r\nwith her broom. Finally she had to lock the door of the cellar when she\r\nlearned from Pauline that Nana was playing doctor down there in the\r\ndark, viciously finding pleasure in applying remedies to the others by\r\nbeating them with sticks.\r\n\r\nWell, one afternoon there was a frightful scene. It was bound to have\r\ncome sooner or later. Nana had thought of a very funny little game. She\r\nhad stolen one of Madame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s wooden shoes from outside the\r\nconcierge\xe2\x80\x99s room. She tied a string to it and began dragging it about\r\nlike a cart. Victor on his side had had the idea to fill it with potato\r\nparings. Then a procession was formed. Nana came first dragging the\r\nwooden shoe. Pauline and Victor walked on her right and left. Then the\r\nentire crowd of urchins followed in order, the big ones first, the\r\nlittle ones next, jostling one another; a baby in long skirts about as\r\ntall as a boot with an old tattered bonnet cocked on one side of its\r\nhead, brought up the rear. And the procession chanted something sad\r\nwith plenty of ohs! and ahs! Nana had said that they were going to play\r\nat a funeral; the potato parings represented the body. When they had\r\ngone the round of the courtyard, they recommenced. They thought it\r\nimmensely amusing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can they be up to?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Boche, who emerged from her\r\nroom to see, ever mistrustful and on the alert.\r\n\r\nAnd when she understood: \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s my shoe!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she furiously. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nthe rogues!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe distributed some smacks, clouted Nana on both cheeks and\r\nadministered a kick to Pauline, that great goose who allowed the others\r\nto steal her mother\xe2\x80\x99s shoe. It so happened that Gervaise was filling a\r\nbucket at the tap. When she beheld Nana, her nose bleeding and choking\r\nwith sobs, she almost sprang at the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s chignon. It was not\r\nright to hit a child as though it were an ox. One could have no heart,\r\none must be the lowest of the low if one did so. Madame Boche naturally\r\nreplied in a similar strain. When one had a beast of a girl like that\r\none should keep her locked up. At length Boche himself appeared in the\r\ndoorway to call his wife to come in and not to enter into so many\r\nexplanations with a filthy thing like her. There was a regular quarrel.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact things had not gone on very pleasantly between the\r\nBoches and the Coupeaus for a month past. Gervaise, who was of a very\r\ngenerous nature, was continually bestowing wine, broth, oranges and\r\nslices of cake on the Boches. One night she had taken the remains of an\r\nendive and beetroot salad to the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s room, knowing that the\r\nlatter would have done anything for such a treat. But on the morrow she\r\nbecame quite pale with rage on hearing Mademoiselle Remanjou relate how\r\nMadame Boche had thrown the salad away in the presence of several\r\npersons with an air of disgust and under the pretext that she, thank\r\ngoodness, was not yet reduced to feeding on things which others had\r\nmessed about. From that time Gervaise took no more presents to the\r\nBoches\xe2\x80\x94nothing. Now the Boches seemed to think that Gervaise was\r\nstealing something which was rightfully theirs. Gervaise saw that she\r\nhad made a mistake. If she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t catered to them so much in the\r\nbeginning, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten into the habit of expecting it and\r\nmight have remained on good terms with her.\r\n\r\nNow the concierge began to spread slander about Gervaise. There was a\r\ngreat fuss with the landlord, Monsieur Marescot, at the October rental\r\nperiod, because Gervaise was a day late with the rent. Madame Boche\r\naccused her of eating up all her money in fancy dishes. Monsieur\r\nMarescot charged into the laundry demanding to be paid at once. He\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to remove his hat. The money was ready and was paid\r\nto him immediately. The Boches had now made up with the Lorilleuxs who\r\nnow came and did their guzzling in the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. They assured\r\neach other that they never would have fallen out if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for\r\nClump-clump. She was enough to set mountains to fighting. Ah! the\r\nBoches knew her well now, they could understand how much the Lorilleuxs\r\nmust suffer. And whenever she passed beneath the doorway they all\r\naffected to sneer at her.\r\n\r\nOne day, Gervaise went up to see the Lorilleuxs in spite of this. It\r\nwas with respect to mother Coupeau who was then sixty-seven years old.\r\nMother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s eyesight was almost completely gone. Her legs too were\r\nno longer what they used to be. She had been obliged to give up her\r\nlast cleaning job and now threatened to die of hunger if assistance\r\nwere not forthcoming. Gervaise thought it shameful that a woman of her\r\nage, having three children should be thus abandoned by heaven and\r\nearth. And as Coupeau refused to speak to the Lorilleuxs on the subject\r\nsaying that she, Gervaise, could very well go and do so, the latter\r\nwent up in a fit of indignation with which her heart was almost\r\nbursting.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached their door she entered without knocking. Nothing had\r\nbeen changed since the night when the Lorilleuxs, at their first\r\nmeeting had received her so ungraciously. The same strip of faded\r\nwoolen stuff separated the room from the workshop, a lodging like a gun\r\nbarrel, and which looked as though it had been built for an eel. Right\r\nat the back Lorilleux, leaning over his bench, was squeezing together\r\none by one the links of a piece of chain, whilst Madame Lorilleux,\r\nstanding in front of the vise was passing a gold wire through the\r\ndraw-plate. In the broad daylight the little forge had a rosy\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you\xe2\x80\x99re surprised to see me as\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re at daggers drawn. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve come neither for you nor myself you\r\nmay be quite sure. It\xe2\x80\x99s for mother Coupeau that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come. Yes, I have\r\ncome to see if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let her beg her bread from the charity of\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine way to burst in upon one!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame\r\nLorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cOne must have a rare cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she turned her back and resumed drawing her gold wire, affecting to\r\nignore her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s presence. But Lorilleux raised his pale face\r\nand cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as he had heard perfectly well, he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore back-bitings, eh? She\xe2\x80\x99s nice, mother Coupeau, to go and cry\r\nstarvation everywhere! Yet only the day before yesterday she dined\r\nhere. We do what we can. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got all the gold of Peru. Only if\r\nshe goes about gossiping with others she had better stay with them, for\r\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t like spies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took up the piece of chain and turned his back also, adding as\r\nthough with regret:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen everyone gives five francs a month, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give five francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had calmed down and felt quite chilled by the wooden looking\r\nfaces of the Lorilleux. She had never once set foot in their rooms\r\nwithout experiencing a certain uneasiness. With her eyes fixed on the\r\nfloor, staring at the holes of the wooden grating through which the\r\nwaste gold fell she now explained herself in a reasonable manner.\r\nMother Coupeau had three children; if each one gave five francs it\r\nwould only make fifteen francs, and really that was not enough, one\r\ncould not live on it; they must at least triple the sum. But Lorilleux\r\ncried out. Where did she think he could steal fifteen francs a month?\r\nIt was quite amusing, people thought he was rich simply because he had\r\ngold in his place. He began then to criticize mother Coupeau: she had\r\nto have her morning coffee, she took a sip of brandy now and then, she\r\nwas as demanding as if she were rich. _Mon Dieu!_ Sure, everyone liked\r\nthe good things of life. But if you\xe2\x80\x99ve never saved a sou, you had to do\r\nwhat other folks did and do without. Besides, mother Coupeau wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too\r\nold to work. She could see well enough when she was trying to pick a\r\nchoice morsel from the platter. She was just an old spendthrift trying\r\nto get others to provide her with comforts. Even had he had the means,\r\nhe would have considered it wrong to support any one in idleness.\r\n\r\nGervaise remained conciliatory, and peaceably argued against all this\r\nbad reasoning. She tried to soften the Lorilleuxs. But the husband\r\nended by no longer answering her. The wife was now at the forge\r\nscouring a piece of chain in the little, long-handled brass saucepan\r\nfull of lye-water. She still affectedly turned her back, as though a\r\nhundred leagues away. And Gervaise continued speaking, watching them\r\npretending to be absorbed in their labor in the midst of the black dust\r\nof the workshop, their bodies distorted, their clothes patched and\r\ngreasy, both become stupidly hardened like old tools in the pursuit of\r\ntheir narrow mechanical task. Then suddenly anger again got the better\r\nof her and she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather it was so; keep your money! I\xe2\x80\x99ll give mother\r\nCoupeau a home, do you hear? I picked up a cat the other evening, so I\r\ncan at least do the same for your mother. And she shall be in want of\r\nnothing; she shall have her coffee and her drop of brandy! Good\r\nheavens! what a vile family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words Madame Lorilleux turned round. She brandished the\r\nsaucepan as though she was about to throw the lye-water in her\r\nsister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s face. She stammered with rage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off, or I shall do you an injury! And don\xe2\x80\x99t count on the five\r\nfrancs because I won\xe2\x80\x99t give a radish! No, not a radish! Ah well, yes,\r\nfive francs! Mother would be your servant and you would enjoy yourself\r\nwith my five francs! If she goes to live with you, tell her this, she\r\nmay croak, I won\xe2\x80\x99t even send her a glass of water. Now off you go!\r\nClear out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a monster of a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise violently slamming the door.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow she brought mother Coupeau to live with her, putting her\r\nbed in the inner room where Nana slept. The moving did not take long,\r\nfor all the furniture mother Coupeau had was her bed, an ancient walnut\r\nwardrobe which was put in the dirty-clothes room, a table, and two\r\nchairs. They sold the table and had the chairs recaned. From the very\r\nfirst the old lady took over the sweeping. She washed the dishes and\r\nmade herself useful, happy to have settled her problem.\r\n\r\nThe Lorilleux were furious enough to explode, especially since Madame\r\nLerat was now back on good terms with the Coupeaus. One day the two\r\nsisters, the flower-maker and the chainmaker came to blows about\r\nGervaise because Madame Lerat dared to express approval of the way she\r\nwas taking care of their mother. When she noticed how this upset the\r\nother, she went on to remark that Gervaise had magnificent eyes, eyes\r\nwarm enough to set paper on fire. The two of them commenced slapping\r\neach other and swore they never would see each other again. Nowadays\r\nMadame Lerat often spent her evenings in the shop, laughing to herself\r\nat Clemence\xe2\x80\x99s spicy remarks.\r\n\r\nThree years passed by. There were frequent quarrels and\r\nreconciliations. Gervaise did not care a straw for the Lorilleux, the\r\nBoches and all the others who were not of her way of thinking. If they\r\ndid not like it, they could forget it. She earned what she wished, that\r\nwas her principal concern. The people of the neighborhood had ended by\r\ngreatly esteeming her, for one did not find many customers so kind as\r\nshe was, paying punctually, never caviling or higgling. She bought her\r\nbread of Madame Coudeloup, in the Rue des Poissonniers; her meat of\r\nstout Charles, a butcher in the Rue Polonceau; her groceries at\r\nLehongre\xe2\x80\x99s, in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, almost opposite her own shop.\r\nFrancois, the wine merchant at the corner of the street, supplied her\r\nwith wine in baskets of fifty bottles. Her neighbor Vigouroux, whose\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s hips must have been black and blue, the men pinched her so much,\r\nsold coke to her at the same price as the gas company. And, in all\r\ntruth, her tradespeople served her faithfully, knowing that there was\r\neverything to gain by treating her well.\r\n\r\nBesides, whenever she went out around the neighborhood, she was greeted\r\neverywhere. She felt quite at home. Sometimes she put off doing a\r\nlaundry job just to enjoy being outdoors among her good friends. On\r\ndays when she was too rushed to do her own cooking and had to go out to\r\nbuy something already cooked, she would stop to gossip with her arms\r\nfull of bowls. The neighbor she respected the most was still the\r\nwatchmaker. Often she would cross the street to greet him in his tiny\r\ncupboard of a shop, taking pleasure in the gaiety of the little cuckoo\r\nclocks with their pendulums ticking away the hours in chorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in the autumn Gervaise, who had been taking some washing\r\nhome to a customer in the Rue des Portes-Blanches, found herself at the\r\nbottom of the Rue des Poissonniers just as the day was declining. It\r\nhad rained in the morning, the weather was very mild and an odor rose\r\nfrom the greasy pavement; and the laundress, burdened with her big\r\nbasket, was rather out of breath, slow of step, and inclined to take\r\nher ease as she ascended the street with the vague preoccupation of a\r\nlonging increased by her weariness. She would have liked to have had\r\nsomething to eat. Then, on raising her eyes she beheld the name of the\r\nRue Marcadet, and she suddenly had the idea of going to see Goujet at\r\nhis forge. He had no end of times told her to look in any day she was\r\ncurious to see how iron was wrought. Besides in the presence of other\r\nworkmen she would ask for Etienne, and make believe that she had merely\r\ncalled for the youngster.\r\n\r\nThe factory was somewhere on this end of the Rue Marcadet, but she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where and street numbers were often lacking on\r\nthose ramshackle buildings separated by vacant lots. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nlived on this street for all the gold in the world. It was a wide\r\nstreet, but dirty, black with soot from factories, with holes in the\r\npavement and deep ruts filled with stagnant water. On both sides were\r\nrows of sheds, workshops with beams and brickwork exposed so that they\r\nseemed unfinished, a messy collection of masonry. Beside them were\r\ndubious lodging houses and even more dubious taverns. All she could\r\nrecall was that the bolt factory was next to a yard full of scrap iron\r\nand rags, a sort of open sewer spread over the ground, storing\r\nmerchandise worth hundreds of thousands of francs, according to Goujet.\r\n\r\nThe street was filled with a noisy racket. Exhaust pipes on roofs\r\npuffed out violent jets of steam; an automatic sawmill added a rhythmic\r\nscreeching; a button factory shook the ground with the rumbling of its\r\nmachines. She was looking up toward the Montmartre height, hesitant,\r\nuncertain whether to continue, when a gust of wind blew down a mass of\r\nsooty smoke that covered the entire street. She closed her eyes and\r\nheld her breath. At that moment she heard the sound of hammers in\r\ncadence. Without realizing it, she had arrived directly in front of the\r\nbolt factory which she now recognized by the vacant lot beside it full\r\nof piles of scrap iron and old rags.\r\n\r\nShe still hesitated, not knowing where to enter. A broken fence opened\r\na passage which seemed to lead through the heaps of rubbish from some\r\nbuildings recently pulled down. Two planks had been thrown across a\r\nlarge puddle of muddy water that barred the way. She ended by venturing\r\nalong them, turned to the left and found herself lost in the depths of\r\na strange forest of old carts, standing on end with their shafts in the\r\nair, and of hovels in ruins, the wood-work of which was still standing.\r\nToward the back, stabbing through the half-light of sundown, a flame\r\ngleamed red. The clamor of the hammers had ceased. She was advancing\r\ncarefully when a workman, his face blackened with coal-dust and wearing\r\na goatee passed near her, casting a side-glance with his pale eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d asked she, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s here is it not that a boy named Etienne works?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEtienne, Etienne,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the workman in a hoarse voice as he\r\ntwisted himself about. \xe2\x80\x9cEtienne; no I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic reek like that from old brandy casks issued from his\r\nmouth. Meeting a woman in this dark corner seemed to be giving the\r\nfellow ideas, and so Gervaise drew back saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yet it\xe2\x80\x99s here that Monsieur Goujet works, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Goujet, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the workman; \xe2\x80\x9cI know Goujet! If you come for\r\nGoujet, go right to the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd turning round he called out at the top of his voice, which had a\r\nsound of cracked brass:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say Golden-Mug, here\xe2\x80\x99s a lady wants you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a clanging of iron drowned the cry! Gervaise went to the end. She\r\nreached a door and stretching out her neck looked in. At first she\r\ncould distinguish nothing. The forge had died down, but there was still\r\na little glow which held back the advancing shadows from its corner.\r\nGreat shadows seemed to float in the air. At times black shapes passed\r\nbefore the fire, shutting off this last bit of brightness, silhouettes\r\nof men so strangely magnified that their arms and legs were indistinct.\r\nGervaise, not daring to venture in, called from the doorway in a faint\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Goujet! Monsieur Goujet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly all became lighted up. Beneath the puff of the bellows a jet\r\nof white flame had ascended and the whole interior of the shed could be\r\nseen, walled in by wooden planks, with openings roughly plastered over,\r\nand brick walls reinforcing the corners. Coal-ash had painted the whole\r\nexpanse a sooty grey. Spider webs hung from the beams like rags hung up\r\nto dry, heavy with the accumulated dust of years. On shelves along the\r\nwalls, or hanging from nails, or tossed into corners, she saw rusty\r\niron, battered implements and huge tools. The white flame flared\r\nhigher, like an explosion of dazzling sunlight revealing the trampled\r\ndirt underfoot, where the polished steel of four anvils fixed on blocks\r\ntook on a reflection of silver sprinkled with gold.\r\n\r\nThen Gervaise recognized Goujet in front of the forge by his beautiful\r\nyellow beard. Etienne was blowing the bellows. Two other workmen were\r\nthere, but she only beheld Goujet and walked forward and stood before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s Madame Gervaise!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed with a bright look on his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pleasant surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as his comrades appeared to be rather amused, he pushed Etienne\r\ntowards his mother and resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come to see the youngster. He behaves himself well, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeginning to get some strength in his wrists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to find your way here. I thought I was\r\ngoing to the end of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter telling about her journey, she asked why no one in the shop knew\r\nEtienne\xe2\x80\x99s name. Goujet laughed and explained to her that everybody\r\ncalled him \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Zouzou\xe2\x80\x9d because he had his hair cut short like that\r\nof a Zouave. While they were talking together Etienne stopped working\r\nthe bellows and the flame of the forge dwindled to a rosy glow amid the\r\ngathering darkness. Touched by the presence of this smiling young\r\nwoman, the blacksmith stood gazing at her.\r\n\r\nThen, as neither continued speaking, he seemed to recollect and broke\r\nthe silence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Madame Gervaise, I\xe2\x80\x99ve something that has to be finished.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll stay, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? You\xe2\x80\x99re not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained. Etienne returned to the bellows. The forge was soon\r\nablaze again with a cloud of sparks; the more so as the youngster,\r\nwanting to show his mother what he could do, was making the bellows\r\nblow a regular hurricane. Goujet, standing up watching a bar of iron\r\nheating, was waiting with the tongs in his hand. The bright glare\r\nilluminated him without a shadow\xe2\x80\x94sleeves rolled back, shirt neck open,\r\nbare arms and chest. When the bar was at white heat he seized it with\r\nthe tongs and cut it with a hammer on the anvil, in pieces of equal\r\nlength, as though he had been gently breaking pieces of glass. Then he\r\nput the pieces back into the fire, from which he took them one by one\r\nto work them into shape. He was forging hexagonal rivets. He placed\r\neach piece in a tool-hole of the anvil, bent down the iron that was to\r\nform the head, flattened the six sides and threw the finished rivet\r\nstill red-hot on to the black earth, where its bright light gradually\r\ndied out; and this with a continuous hammering, wielding in his right\r\nhand a hammer weighing five pounds, completing a detail at every blow,\r\nturning and working the iron with such dexterity that he was able to\r\ntalk to and look at those about him. The anvil had a silvery ring.\r\nWithout a drop of perspiration, quite at his ease, he struck in a\r\ngood-natured sort of a way, not appearing to exert himself more than on\r\nthe evenings when he cut out pictures at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! these are little rivets of twenty millimetres,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in reply\r\nto Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s questions. \xe2\x80\x9cA fellow can do his three hundred a day. But\r\nit requires practice, for one\xe2\x80\x99s arm soon grows weary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when she asked him if his wrist did not feel stiff at the end of\r\nthe day he laughed aloud. Did she think him a young lady? His wrist had\r\nhad plenty of drudgery for fifteen years past; it was now as strong as\r\nthe iron implements it had been so long in contact with. She was right\r\nthough; a gentleman who had never forged a rivet or a bolt, and who\r\nwould try to show off with his five pound hammer, would find himself\r\nprecious stiff in the course of a couple of hours. It did not seem\r\nmuch, but a few years of it often did for some very strong fellows.\r\nDuring this conversation the other workmen were also hammering away all\r\ntogether. Their tall shadows danced about in the light, the red flashes\r\nof the iron that the fire traversed, the gloomy recesses, clouds of\r\nsparks darted out from beneath the hammers and shone like suns on a\r\nlevel with the anvils. And Gervaise, feeling happy and interested in\r\nthe movement round the forge, did not think of leaving. She was going a\r\nlong way round to get nearer to Etienne without having her hands burnt,\r\nwhen she saw the dirty and bearded workman, whom she had spoken to\r\noutside, enter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve found him, madame?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he in his drunken bantering way.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Golden-Mug, it\xe2\x80\x99s I who told madame where to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was called Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, the brick\r\nof bricks, a dab hand at bolt forging, who wetted his iron every day\r\nwith a pint and a half of brandy. He had gone out to have a drop,\r\nbecause he felt he wanted greasing to make him last till six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nWhen he learnt that Little Zouzou\xe2\x80\x99s real name was Etienne, he thought\r\nit very funny; and he showed his black teeth as he laughed. Then he\r\nrecognized Gervaise. Only the day before he had had a glass of wine\r\nwith Coupeau. You could speak to Coupeau about Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst; he would at once say: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly dog!\xe2\x80\x9d Ah!\r\nthat joker Coupeau! He was one of the right sort; he stood treat\r\noftener than his turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m awfully glad to know you\xe2\x80\x99re his missus,\xe2\x80\x9d added he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe deserves to have a pretty wife. Eh, Golden-Mug, madame is a fine\r\nwoman, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was becoming quite gallant, sidling up towards the laundress, who\r\ntook hold of her basket and held it in front of her so as to keep him\r\nat a distance. Goujet, annoyed and seeing that his comrade was joking\r\nbecause of his friendship for Gervaise, called out to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, lazybones, what about the forty millimetre bolts? Do you think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re equal to them now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your gullet full, you\r\nconfounded guzzler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith was alluding to an order for big bolts which\r\nnecessitated two beaters at the anvil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to start at this moment, big baby!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Salted-Mouth,\r\notherwise Drink-without-Thirst. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sucks it\xe2\x80\x99s thumb and thinks itself\r\na man. In spite of your size I\xe2\x80\x99m equal to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, at once. Look sharp and off we go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight you are, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey taunted each other, stimulated by Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s presence. Goujet\r\nplaced the pieces of iron that had been cut beforehand in the fire,\r\nthen he fixed a tool-hole of large bore on an anvil. His comrade had\r\ntaken from against the wall two sledge-hammers weighing twenty pounds\r\neach, the two big sisters of the factory whom the workers called Fifine\r\nand Dedele. And he continued to brag, talking of a half-gross of rivets\r\nwhich he had forged for the Dunkirk lighthouse, regular jewels, things\r\nto be put in a museum, they were so daintily finished off. Hang it all,\r\nno! he did not fear competition; before meeting with another chap like\r\nhim, you might search every factory in the capital. They were going to\r\nhave a laugh; they would see what they would see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame will be judge,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning towards the young woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough chattering,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Goujet. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Zouzou, show your muscle!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hot enough, my lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, asked: \xe2\x80\x9cSo we strike\r\ntogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it! each his own bolt, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis statement operated as a damper, and Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, on hearing\r\nit, remained speechless, in spite of his boasting. Bolts of forty\r\nmillimetres fashioned by one man had never before been seen; the more\r\nso as the bolts were to be round-headed, a work of great difficulty, a\r\nreal masterpiece to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe three other workmen came over, leaving their jobs, to watch. A\r\ntall, lean one wagered a bottle of wine that Goujet would be beaten.\r\nMeanwhile the two blacksmiths had chosen their sledge hammers with eyes\r\nclosed, because Fifine weighed a half pound more than Dedele.\r\nSalted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, had the good luck to put\r\nhis hand on Dedele; Fifine fell to Golden-Mug.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the iron to get hot enough, Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, again showing off, struck a pose before the anvil\r\nwhile casting side glances toward Gervaise. He planted himself solidly,\r\ntapping his feet impatiently like a man ready for a fight, throwing all\r\nhis strength into practice swings with Dedele. _Mon Dieu!_ He was good\r\nat this; he could have flattened the Vendome column like a pancake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, off you go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Goujet, placing one of the pieces of iron,\r\nas thick as a girl\xe2\x80\x99s wrist, in the tool-hole.\r\n\r\nSalted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, leant back, and swung\r\nDedele round with both hands. Short and lean, with his goatee\r\nbristling, and with his wolf-like eyes glaring beneath his unkempt\r\nhair, he seemed to snap at each swing of the hammer, springing up from\r\nthe ground as though carried away by the force he put into the blow. He\r\nwas a fierce one, who fought with the iron, annoyed at finding it so\r\nhard, and he even gave a grunt whenever he thought he had planted a\r\nfierce stroke. Perhaps brandy did weaken other people\xe2\x80\x99s arms, but he\r\nneeded brandy in his veins, instead of blood. The drop he had taken a\r\nlittle while before had made his carcass as warm as a boiler; he felt\r\nhe had the power of a steam-engine within him. And the iron seemed to\r\nbe afraid of him this time; he flattened it more easily than if it had\r\nbeen a quid of tobacco. And it was a sight to see how Dedele waltzed!\r\nShe cut such capers, with her tootsies in the air, just like a little\r\ndancer at the Elysee Montmartre, who exhibits her fine underclothes;\r\nfor it would never do to dawdle, iron is so deceitful, it cools at\r\nonce, just to spite the hammer. With thirty blows, Salted-Mouth,\r\notherwise Drink-without-Thirst, had fashioned the head of his bolt. But\r\nhe panted, his eyes were half out of his head, and got into a great\r\nrage as he felt his arms growing tired. Then, carried away by wrath,\r\njumping about and yelling, he gave two more blows, just out of revenge\r\nfor his trouble. When he took the bolt from the hole, it was deformed,\r\nits head being askew like a hunchback\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that quickly beaten into shape?\xe2\x80\x9d said he all the same,\r\nwith his self-confidence, as he presented his work to Gervaise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no judge, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the laundress, reservedly.\r\n\r\nBut she saw plainly enough the marks of Dedele\xe2\x80\x99s last two kicks on the\r\nbolt, and she was very pleased. She bit her lips so as not to laugh,\r\nfor now Goujet had every chance of winning.\r\n\r\nIt was now Golden-Mug\xe2\x80\x99s turn. Before commencing, he gave the laundress\r\na look full of confident tenderness. Then he did not hurry himself. He\r\nmeasured his distance, and swung the hammer from on high with all his\r\nmight and at regular intervals. He had the classic style, accurate,\r\nevenly balanced, and supple. Fifine, in his hands, did not cut capers,\r\nlike at a dance-hall, but made steady, certain progress; she rose and\r\nfell in cadence, like a lady of quality solemnly leading some ancient\r\nminuet.\r\n\r\nThere was no brandy in Golden-Mug\xe2\x80\x99s veins, only blood, throbbing\r\npowerfully even into Fifine and controlling the job. That stalwart\r\nfellow! What a magnificent man he was at work. The high flame of the\r\nforge shone full on his face. His whole face seemed golden indeed with\r\nhis short hair curling over his forehead and his splendid yellow beard.\r\nHis neck was as straight as a column and his immense chest was wide\r\nenough for a woman to sleep across it. His shoulders and sculptured\r\narms seemed to have been copied from a giant\xe2\x80\x99s statue in some museum.\r\nYou could see his muscles swelling, mountains of flesh rippling and\r\nhardening under the skin; his shoulders, his chest, his neck expanded;\r\nhe seemed to shed light about him, becoming beautiful and all-powerful\r\nlike a kindly god.\r\n\r\nHe had now swung Fifine twenty times, his eyes always fixed on the\r\niron, drawing a deep breath with each blow, yet showing only two great\r\ndrops of sweat trickling down from his temples. He counted:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Calmly Fifine continued, like a\r\nnoble lady dancing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a show-off!\xe2\x80\x9d jeeringly murmured Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst.\r\n\r\nGervaise, standing opposite Goujet, looked at him with an affectionate\r\nsmile. _Mon Dieu!_ What fools men are! Here these two men were,\r\npounding on their bolts to pay court to her. She understood it. They\r\nwere battling with hammer blows, like two big red roosters vying for\r\nthe favors of a little white hen. Sometimes the human heart has\r\nfantastic ways of expressing itself. This thundering of Dedele and\r\nFifine upon the anvil was for her, this forge roaring and overflowing\r\nwas for her. They were forging their love before her, battling over\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, she rather enjoyed it. All women are happy to receive\r\ncompliments. The mighty blows of Golden-Mug found echoes in her heart;\r\nthey rang within her, a crystal-clear music in time with the throbbing\r\nof her pulse. She had the feeling that this hammering was driving\r\nsomething deep inside of her, something solid, something hard as the\r\niron of the bolt.\r\n\r\nShe had no doubt Goujet would win. Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, was much too ugly in his dirty tunic, jumping\r\naround like a monkey that had escaped from a zoo. She waited, blushing\r\nred, happy that the heat could explain the blush.\r\n\r\nGoujet was still counting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd twenty-eight!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he at length, laying the hammer on the\r\nground. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s finished; you can look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head of the bolt was clean, polished, and without a flaw, regular\r\ngoldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s work, with the roundness of a marble cast in a mold. The\r\nother men looked at it and nodded their heads; there was no denying it\r\nwas lovely enough to be worshipped. Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, tried indeed to chuff; but it was no use, and\r\nended by returning to his anvil, with his nose put out of joint.\r\nGervaise had squeezed up against Goujet, as though to get a better\r\nview. Etienne having let go the bellows, the forge was once more\r\nbecoming enveloped in shadow, like a brilliant red sunset suddenly\r\ngiving way to black night. And the blacksmith and the laundress\r\nexperienced a sweet pleasure in feeling this gloom surround them in\r\nthat shed black with soot and filings, and where an odor of old iron\r\nprevailed. They could not have thought themselves more alone in the\r\nBois de Vincennes had they met there in the depths of some copse. He\r\ntook her hand as though he had conquered her.\r\n\r\nOutside, they scarcely exchanged a word. All he could find to say was\r\nthat she might have taken Etienne away with her, had it not been that\r\nthere was still another half-hour\xe2\x80\x99s work to get through. When she\r\nstarted away he called her back, wanting a few more minutes with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along. You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen all the place. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led her to another shed where the owner was installing a new\r\nmachine. She hesitated in the doorway, oppressed by an instinctive\r\ndread. The great hall was vibrating from the machines and black shadows\r\nfilled the air. He reassured her with a smile, swearing that there was\r\nnothing to fear, only she should be careful not to let her skirts get\r\ncaught in any of the gears. He went first and she followed into the\r\ndeafening hubbub of whistling, amid clouds of steam peopled by human\r\nshadows moving busily.\r\n\r\nThe passages were very narrow and there were obstacles to step over,\r\nholes to avoid, passing carts to move back from. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndistinguish anything clearly or hear what Goujet was saying.\r\n\r\nGervaise looked up and stopped to stare at the leather belts hanging\r\nfrom the roof in a gigantic spider web, each strip ceaselessly\r\nrevolving. The steam engine that drove them was hidden behind a low\r\nbrick wall so that the belts seemed to be moving by themselves. She\r\nstumbled and almost fell while looking up.\r\n\r\nGoujet raised his voice with explanations. There were the tapping\r\nmachines operated by women, which put threads on bolts and nuts. Their\r\nsteel gears were shining with oil. She could follow the entire process.\r\nShe nodded her head and smiled.\r\n\r\nShe was still a little tense, however, feeling uneasy at being so small\r\namong these rough metalworkers. She jumped back more than once, her\r\nblood suddenly chilled by the dull thud of a machine.\r\n\r\nGoujet had stopped before one of the rivet machines. He stood there\r\nbrooding, his head lowered, his gaze fixed. This machine forged forty\r\nmillimetre rivets with the calm ease of a giant. Nothing could be\r\nsimpler. The stoker took the iron shank from the furnace; the striker\r\nput it into the socket, where a continuous stream of water cooled it to\r\nprevent softening of the steel. The press descended and the bolt flew\r\nout onto the ground, its head as round as though cast in a mold. Every\r\ntwelve hours this machine made hundreds of kilograms of bolts!\r\n\r\nGoujet was not a mean person, but there were moments when he wanted to\r\ntake Fifine and smash this machine to bits because he was angry to see\r\nthat its arms were stronger than his own. He reasoned with himself,\r\ntelling himself that human flesh cannot compete with steel. But he was\r\nstill deeply hurt. The day would come when machinery would destroy the\r\nskilled worker. Their day\xe2\x80\x99s pay had already fallen from twelve francs\r\nto nine francs. There was talk of cutting it again. He stared at it,\r\nfrowning, for three minutes without saying a word. His yellow beard\r\nseemed to bristle defiantly. Then, gradually an expression of\r\nresignation came over his face and he turned toward Gervaise who was\r\nclinging tightly to him and said with a sad smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! That machine would certainly win a contest. But perhaps it will\r\nbe for the good of mankind in the long run.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit about the welfare of mankind. Smiling, she\r\nsaid to Goujet:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like yours better, because they show the hand of an artist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHearing this gave him great happiness because he had been afraid that\r\nshe might be scornful of him after seeing the machines. _Mon Dieu!_ He\r\nmight be stronger than Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst,\r\nbut the machines were stronger yet. When Gervaise finally took her\r\nleave, Goujet was so happy that he almost crushed her with a hug.\r\n\r\nThe laundress went every Saturday to the Goujets to deliver their\r\nwashing. They still lived in the little house in the Rue Neuve de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. During the first year she had regularly repaid them twenty\r\nfrancs a month; so as not to jumble up the accounts, the washing-book\r\nwas only made up at the end of each month, and then she added to the\r\namount whatever sum was necessary to make the twenty francs, for the\r\nGoujets\xe2\x80\x99 washing rarely came to more than seven or eight francs during\r\nthat time. She had therefore paid off nearly half the sum owing, when\r\none quarter day, not knowing what to do, some of her customers not\r\nhaving kept their promises, she had been obliged to go to the Goujets\r\nand borrow from them sufficient for her rent. On two other occasions\r\nshe had also applied to them for the money to pay her workwomen, so\r\nthat the debt had increased again to four hundred and twenty-five\r\nfrancs. Now, she no longer gave a halfpenny; she worked off the amount\r\nsolely by the washing. It was not that she worked less, or that her\r\nbusiness was not so prosperous. But something was going wrong in her\r\nhome; the money seemed to melt away, and she was glad when she was able\r\nto make both ends meet. _Mon Dieu!_ What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of complaining as\r\nlong as one gets by. She was putting on weight and this caused her to\r\nbecome a bit lazy. She no longer had the energy that she had in the\r\npast. Oh well, there was always something coming in.\r\n\r\nMadame Goujet felt a motherly concern for Gervaise and sometimes\r\nreprimanded her. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t due to the money owed but because she\r\nliked her and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see her get into difficulties. She never\r\nmentioned the debt. In short, she behaved with the utmost delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe morrow of Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the forge happened to be the last\r\nSaturday of the month. When she reached the Goujets, where she made a\r\npoint of going herself, her basket had so weighed on her arms that she\r\nwas quite two minutes before she could get her breath. One would hardly\r\nbelieve how heavy clothes are, especially when there are sheets among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought everything?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame Goujet.\r\n\r\nShe was very strict on that point. She insisted on having her washing\r\nbrought home without a single article being kept back for the sake of\r\norder, as she said. She also required the laundress always to come on\r\nthe day arranged and at the same hour; in that way there was no time\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! yes, everything is here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gervaise smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\r\nnever leave anything behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Madame Goujet; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got into many bad habits\r\nbut you\xe2\x80\x99re still free of that one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd while the laundress emptied her basket, laying the linen on the\r\nbed, the old woman praised her; she never burnt the things nor tore\r\nthem like so many others did, neither did she pull the buttons off with\r\nthe iron; only she used too much blue and made the shirt-fronts too\r\nstiff with starch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look, it\xe2\x80\x99s like cardboard,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, making one crackle\r\nbetween her fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son does not complain, but it cuts his neck.\r\nTo-morrow his neck will be all scratched when we return from\r\nVincennes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gervaise, quite grieved. \xe2\x80\x9cTo look nice,\r\nshirts must be rather stiff, otherwise it\xe2\x80\x99s as though one had a rag on\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s body. You should just see what the gentlemen wear. I do all your\r\nthings myself. The workwomen never touch them and I assure you I take\r\ngreat pains. I would, if necessary, do everything over a dozen times,\r\nbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s for you, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slightly blushed as she stammered out the last words. She was\r\nafraid of showing the great pleasure she took in ironing Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshirts. She certainly had no wicked thoughts, but she was none the less\r\na little bit ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I\xe2\x80\x99m not complaining of your work; I know it\xe2\x80\x99s perfection,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMadame Goujet. \xe2\x80\x9cFor instance, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done this cap splendidly, only you\r\ncould bring out the embroidery like that. And the flutings are all so\r\neven. Oh! I recognize your hand at once. When you give even a\r\ndish-cloth to one of your workwomen I detect it at once. In future, use\r\na little less starch, that\xe2\x80\x99s all! Goujet does not care to look like a\r\nstylish gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had taken out her notebook and was crossing off the various items.\r\nEverything was in order. She noticed that Gervaise was charging six\r\nsous for each bonnet. She protested, but had to agree that it was in\r\nline with present prices. Men\xe2\x80\x99s shirts were five sous, women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunderdrawers four sous, pillow-cases a sou and a half, and aprons one\r\nsou. No, the prices weren\xe2\x80\x99t high. Some laundresses charged a sou more\r\nfor each item.\r\n\r\nGervaise was now calling out the soiled clothes, as she packed them in\r\nher basket, for Madame Goujet to list. Then she lingered on,\r\nembarrassed by a request which she wished to make.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Goujet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cif it does not inconvenience you,\r\nI would like to take the money for the month\xe2\x80\x99s washing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt so happened that that month was a very heavy one, the account they\r\nhad made up together amounting to ten francs, seven sous. Madame Goujet\r\nlooked at her a moment in a serious manner, then she replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, it shall be as you wish. I will not refuse you the money as\r\nyou are in need of it. Only it\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely the way to pay off your debt;\r\nI say that for your sake, you know. Really now, you should be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise received the lecture with bowed head and stammering excuses.\r\nThe ten francs were to make up the amount of a bill she had given her\r\ncoke merchant. But on hearing the word \xe2\x80\x9cbill,\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Goujet became\r\nseverer still. She gave herself as an example; she had reduced her\r\nexpenditure ever since Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s wages had been lowered from twelve to\r\nnine francs a day. When one was wanting in wisdom whilst young, one\r\ndies of hunger in one\xe2\x80\x99s old age. But she held back and didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nGervaise that she gave her their laundry only in order to help her pay\r\noff the debt. Before that she had done all her own washing, and she\r\nwould have to do it herself again if the laundry continued taking so\r\nmuch cash out of her pocket. Gervaise spoke her thanks and left quickly\r\nas soon as she had received the ten francs seven sous. Outside on the\r\nlanding she was so relieved she wanted to dance. She was becoming used\r\nto the annoying, unpleasant difficulties caused by a shortage of money\r\nand preferred to remember not the embarrassment but the joy in escaping\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nIt was also on that Saturday that Gervaise met with a rather strange\r\nadventure as she descended the Goujets\xe2\x80\x99 staircase. She was obliged to\r\nstand up close against the stair-rail with her basket to make way for a\r\ntall bare-headed woman who was coming up, carrying in her hand a very\r\nfresh mackerel, with bloody gills, in a piece of paper. She recognized\r\nVirginie, the girl whose face she had slapped at the wash-house. They\r\nlooked each other full in the face. Gervaise shut her eyes. She thought\r\nfor a moment that she was going to be hit in the face with the fish.\r\nBut no, Virginie even smiled slightly. Then, as her basket was blocking\r\nthe staircase, the laundress wished to show how polite she, too, could\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are completely excused,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tall brunette.\r\n\r\nAnd they remained conversing together on the stairs, reconciled at once\r\nwithout having ventured on a single allusion to the past. Virginie,\r\nthen twenty-nine years old, had become a superb woman of strapping\r\nproportions, her face, however, looking rather long between her two\r\nplaits of jet black hair. She at once began to relate her history just\r\nto show off. She had a husband now; she had married in the spring an\r\nex-journeyman cabinetmaker, who recently left the army, and who had\r\napplied to be admitted into the police, because a post of that kind is\r\nmore to be depended upon and more respectable. She had been out to buy\r\nthe mackerel for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe adores mackerel,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must spoil them, those naughty men,\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t we? But come up. You shall see our home. We are standing in a\r\ndraught here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter Gervaise had told of her own marriage and that she had formerly\r\noccupied the very apartment Virginie now had, Virginie urged her even\r\nmore strongly to come up since it is always nice to visit a spot where\r\none had been happy.\r\n\r\nVirginie had lived for five years on the Left Bank at Gros-Caillou.\r\nThat was where she had met her husband while he was still in the army.\r\nBut she got tired of it, and wanted to come back to the Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or\r\nneighborhood where she knew everyone. She had only been living in the\r\nrooms opposite the Goujets for two weeks. Oh! everything was still a\r\nmess, but they were slowly getting it in order.\r\n\r\nThen, still on the staircase, they finally told each other their names.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Coupeau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Poisson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd from that time forth, they called each other on every possible\r\noccasion Madame Poisson and Madame Coupeau, solely for the pleasure of\r\nbeing madame, they who in former days had been acquainted when\r\noccupying rather questionable positions. However, Gervaise felt rather\r\nmistrustful at heart. Perhaps the tall brunette had made it up the\r\nbetter to avenge herself for the beating at the wash-house by\r\nconcocting some plan worthy of a spiteful hypocritical creature.\r\nGervaise determined to be upon her guard. For the time being, as\r\nVirginie behaved so nicely, she would be nice also.\r\n\r\nIn the room upstairs, Poisson, the husband, a man of thirty-five, with\r\na cadaverous-looking countenance and carroty moustaches and beard, was\r\nseated working at a table near the window. He was making little boxes.\r\nHis only tools were a knife, a tiny saw the size of a nail file and a\r\npot of glue. He was using wood from old cigar boxes, thin boards of\r\nunfinished mahogany upon which he executed fretwork and embellishments\r\nof extraordinary delicacy. All year long he worked at making the same\r\nsize boxes, only varying them occasionally by inlay work, new designs\r\nfor the cover, or putting compartments inside. He did not sell his\r\nwork, he distributed it in presents to persons of his acquaintance. It\r\nwas for his own amusement, a way of occupying his time while waiting\r\nfor his appointment to the police force. It was all that remained with\r\nhim from his former occupation of cabinetmaking.\r\n\r\nPoisson rose from his seat and politely bowed to Gervaise, when his\r\nwife introduced her as an old friend. But he was no talker; he at once\r\nreturned to his little saw. From time to time he merely glanced in the\r\ndirection of the mackerel placed on the corner of the chest of drawers.\r\nGervaise was very pleased to see her old lodging once more. She told\r\nthem whereabouts her own furniture stood, and pointed out the place on\r\nthe floor where Nana had been born. How strange it was to meet like\r\nthis again, after so many years! They never dreamed of running into\r\neach other like this and even living in the same rooms.\r\n\r\nVirginie added some further details. Her husband had inherited a little\r\nmoney from an aunt and he would probably set her up in a shop before\r\nlong. Meanwhile she was still sewing. At length, at the end of a full\r\nhalf hour, the laundress took her leave. Poisson scarcely seemed to\r\nnotice her departure. While seeing her to the door, Virginie promised\r\nto return the visit. And she would have Gervaise do her laundry. While\r\nVirginie was keeping her in further conversation on the landing,\r\nGervaise had the feeling that she wanted to say something about Lantier\r\nand her sister Adele, and this notion upset her a bit. But not a word\r\nwas uttered respecting those unpleasant things; they parted, wishing\r\neach other good-bye in a very amiable manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Madame Coupeau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Madame Poisson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the starting point of a great friendship. A week later,\r\nVirginie never passed Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s shop without going in; and she\r\nremained there gossiping for hours together, to such an extent indeed\r\nthat Poisson, filled with anxiety, fearing she had been run over, would\r\ncome and seek her with his expressionless and death-like countenance.\r\nNow that she was seeing the dressmaker every day Gervaise became aware\r\nof a strange obsession. Every time Virginie began to talk Gervaise had\r\nthe feeling Lantier was going to be mentioned. So she had Lantier on\r\nher mind throughout all of Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s visits. This was silly because,\r\nin fact, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit about Lantier or Adele at this time. She\r\nwas quite certain that she had no curiosity as to what had happened to\r\neither of them. But this obsession got hold of her in spite of herself.\r\nAnyway, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hold it against Virginie, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her fault,\r\nsurely. She enjoyed being with her and looked forward to her visits.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile winter had come, the Coupeaus\xe2\x80\x99 fourth winter in the Rue de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. December and January were particularly cold. It froze hard\r\nas it well could. After New Year\xe2\x80\x99s day the snow remained three weeks\r\nwithout melting. It did not interfere with work, but the contrary, for\r\nwinter is the best season for the ironers. It was very pleasant inside\r\nthe shop! There was never any ice on the window-panes like there was at\r\nthe grocer\xe2\x80\x99s and the hosier\xe2\x80\x99s opposite. The stove was always stuffed\r\nwith coke and kept things as hot as a Turkish bath. With the laundry\r\nsteaming overhead you could almost imagine it was summer. You were\r\nquite comfortable with the doors closed and so much warmth everywhere\r\nthat you were tempted to doze off with your eyes open. Gervaise laughed\r\nand said it reminded her of summer in the country. The street traffic\r\nmade no noise in the snow and you could hardly hear the pedestrians who\r\npassed by. Only children\xe2\x80\x99s voices were heard in the silence, especially\r\nthe noisy band of urchins who had made a long slide in the gutter near\r\nthe blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\nGervaise would sometimes go over to the door, wipe the moisture from\r\none of the panes with her hand, and look out to see what was happening\r\nto her neighborhood due to this extraordinary cold spell. Not one nose\r\nwas being poked out of the adjacent shops. The entire neighborhood was\r\nmuffled in snow. The only person she was able to exchange nods with was\r\nthe coal-dealer next door, who still walked out bare-headed despite the\r\nsevere freeze.\r\n\r\nWhat was especially enjoyable in this awful weather was to have some\r\nnice hot coffee in the middle of the day. The workwomen had no cause\r\nfor complaint. The mistress made it very strong and without a grain of\r\nchicory. It was quite different to Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s coffee, which\r\nwas like ditch-water. Only whenever mother Coupeau undertook to make\r\nit, it was always an interminable time before it was ready, because she\r\nwould fall asleep over the kettle. On these occasions, when the\r\nworkwomen had finished their lunch, they would do a little ironing\r\nwhilst waiting for the coffee.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that on the morrow of Twelfth-day half-past twelve\r\nstruck and still the coffee was not ready. It seemed to persist in\r\ndeclining to pass through the strainer. Mother Coupeau tapped against\r\nthe pot with a tea-spoon; and one could hear the drops falling slowly,\r\none by one, and without hurrying themselves any the more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said tall Clemence; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll make it thick. To-day\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be as much to eat as to drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTall Clemence was working on a man\xe2\x80\x99s shirt, the plaits of which she\r\nseparated with her finger-nail. She had caught a cold, her eyes were\r\nfrightfully swollen and her chest was shaken with fits of coughing,\r\nwhich doubled her up beside the work-table. With all that she had not\r\neven a handkerchief round her neck and she was dressed in some cheap\r\nflimsy woolen stuff in which she shivered. Close by, Madame Putois,\r\nwrapped up in flannel muffled up to her ears, was ironing a petticoat\r\nwhich she turned round the skirt-board, the narrow end of which rested\r\non the back of a chair; whilst a sheet laid on the floor prevented the\r\npetticoat from getting dirty as it trailed along the tiles. Gervaise\r\nalone occupied half the work-table with some embroidered muslin\r\ncurtains, over which she passed her iron in a straight line with her\r\narms stretched out to avoid making any creases. All on a sudden the\r\ncoffee running through noisily caused her to raise her head. It was\r\nthat squint-eyed Augustine who had just given it an outlet by thrusting\r\na spoon through the strainer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it alone!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever is the matter with you?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be like drinking mud now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau had placed five glasses on a corner of the work-table\r\nthat was free. The women now left their work. The mistress always\r\npoured out the coffee herself after putting two lumps of sugar into\r\neach glass. It was the moment that they all looked forward to. On this\r\noccasion, as each one took her glass and squatted down on a little\r\nstool in front of the stove, the shop-door opened. Virginie entered,\r\nshivering all over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my children,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cit cuts you in two! I can no longer feel\r\nmy ears. The cold is something awful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s Madame Poisson!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! You\xe2\x80\x99ve come\r\nat the right time. You must have some coffee with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say no. One feels the frost in one\xe2\x80\x99s bones merely\r\nby crossing the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was still some coffee left, luckily. Mother Coupeau went and\r\nfetched a sixth glass, and Gervaise let Virginie help herself to sugar\r\nout of politeness. The workwomen moved to give Virginie a small space\r\nclose to the stove. Her nose was very red, she shivered a bit, pressing\r\nher hands which were stiff with cold around the glass to warm them. She\r\nhad just come from the grocery store where you froze to death waiting\r\nfor a quarter-pound of cheese and so she raved about the warmth of the\r\nshop. It felt so good on one\xe2\x80\x99s skin. After warming up, she stretched\r\nout her long legs and the six of them relaxed together, supping their\r\ncoffee slowly, surround by all the work still to be done. Mother\r\nCoupeau and Virginie were the only ones on chairs, the others, on low\r\nbenches, seemed to be sitting on the floor. Squint-eyed Augustine had\r\npulled over a corner of the cloth below the skirt, stretching herself\r\nout on it.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke at first; all kept their noses in their glasses, enjoying\r\ntheir coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Clemence.\r\n\r\nBut she was seized with a fit of coughing, and almost choked. She leant\r\nher head against the wall to cough with more force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad cough you\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginie. \xe2\x80\x9cWherever did you catch\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne never knows!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Clemence, wiping her face with her sleeve.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been the other night. There were two girls who were\r\nflaying each other outside the \xe2\x80\x98Grand-Balcony.\xe2\x80\x99 I wanted to see, so I\r\nstood there whilst the snow was falling. Ah, what a drubbing! It was\r\nenough to make one die with laughing. One had her nose almost pulled\r\noff; the blood streamed on the ground. When the other, a great long\r\nstick like me, saw the blood, she slipped away as quick as she could.\r\nAnd I coughed nearly all night. Besides that too, men are so stupid in\r\nbed, they don\xe2\x80\x99t let you have any covers over you half the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty conduct that,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Putois. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re killing\r\nyourself, my girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if it pleases me to kill myself! Life isn\xe2\x80\x99t so very amusing.\r\nSlaving all the blessed day long to earn fifty-five sous, cooking one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood from morning to night in front of the stove; no, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad enough of it! All the same though, this cough won\xe2\x80\x99t do me the\r\nservice of making me croak. It\xe2\x80\x99ll go off the same way it came.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA short silence ensued. The good-for-nothing Clemence, who led riots in\r\nlow dancing establishments, and shrieked like a screech-owl at work,\r\nalways saddened everyone with her thoughts of death. Gervaise knew her\r\nwell, and so merely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re never very gay the morning after a night of high living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Gervaise did not like this talk about women\r\nfighting. Because of the flogging at the wash-house it annoyed her\r\nwhenever anyone spoke before her and Virginie of kicks with wooden\r\nshoes and of slaps in the face. It so happened, too, that Virginie was\r\nlooking at her and smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cyesterday I saw some hair-pulling.\r\nThey almost tore each other to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho were they?\xe2\x80\x9d Madame Putois inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe midwife and her maid, you know, a little blonde. What a pest the\r\ngirl is! She was yelling at her employer that she had got rid of a\r\nchild for the fruit woman and that she was going to tell the police if\r\nshe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid to keep quiet. So the midwife slapped her right in the\r\nface and then the little blonde jumped on her and started scratching\r\nher and pulling her hair, really\xe2\x80\x94by the roots. The sausage-man had to\r\ngrab her to put a stop to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workwomen laughed. Then they all took a sip of coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe that she really got rid of a child?\xe2\x80\x9d Clemence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! The rumor was all round the neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginie answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it myself, you understand, but it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the job. All\r\nmidwives do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Madame Putois. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be pretty stupid to put\r\nyourself in their hands. No thanks, you could be maimed for life. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a sure way to do it. Drink a glass of holy water every evening\r\nand make the sign of the cross three times over your stomach with your\r\nthumb. Then your troubles will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEveryone thought mother Coupeau was asleep, but she shook her head in\r\nprotest. She knew another way and it was infallible. You had to eat a\r\nhard-cooked egg every two hours, and put spinach leaves on your loins.\r\nSquint-eyed Augustine set up a hen-cackling when she heard this. They\r\nhad forgotten about her. Gervaise lifted up the petticoat that was\r\nbeing ironed and found her rolling on the floor with laughter. She\r\njerked her upright. What was she laughing about? Was it right for her\r\nto be eavesdropping when older people were talking, the little goose?\r\nAnyway it was time for her to deliver the laundry to a friend of Madame\r\nLerat at Les Batignolles. So Gervaise hung a basket on her arm and\r\npushed her toward the door. Augustine went off, sobbing and sniveling,\r\ndragging her feet in the snow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile mother Coupeau, Madame Putois and Clemence were discussing\r\nthe effectiveness of hard-cooked eggs and spinach leaves. Then Virginie\r\nsaid softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ you have a fight, and then you make it up, if you have a\r\ngenerous heart.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned toward Gervaise with a smile and added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold any grudge against you for that business at the\r\nwash-house. You remember it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was what Gervaise had been dreading. She guessed that the subject\r\nof Lantier and Adele would now come up.\r\n\r\nVirginie had moved close to Gervaise so as not to be overheard by the\r\nothers. Gervaise, lulled by the excessive heat, felt so limp that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even summon the willpower to change the subject. She foresaw\r\nwhat the tall brunette would say and her heart was stirred with an\r\nemotion which she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to admit to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99m not hurting your feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginie continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOften I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad it on the tip of my tongue. But since we are now on the subject,\r\nword of honor, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any grudge against you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stirred her remaining coffee and then took a small sip. Gervaise,\r\nwith her heart in her throat, wondered if Virginie had really forgiven\r\nher as completely as she said, for she seemed to observe sparks in her\r\ndark eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginie went on, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had an excuse. They played a really\r\nrotten, dirty trick on you. To be fair about it, if it had been me, I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave taken a knife to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drank another small sip, then added rapidly without a pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring them happiness, _mon Dieu_! Not a bit of it.\r\nThey went to live over at La Glaciere, in a filthy street that was\r\nalways muddy. I went two days later to have lunch with them. I can tell\r\nyou, it was quite a trip by bus. Well, I found them already fighting.\r\nReally, as I came in they were boxing each other\xe2\x80\x99s ears. Fine pair of\r\nlove birds! Adele isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the rope to hang her. I say that even if\r\nshe is my own sister. It would take too long to relate all the nasty\r\ntricks she played on me, and anyhow, it\xe2\x80\x99s between the two of us. As for\r\nLantier\xe2\x80\x94well, he\xe2\x80\x99s no good either. He\xe2\x80\x99d beat the hide off you for\r\nanything, and with his fist closed too. They fought all the time. The\r\npolice even came once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginie went on about other fights. Oh, she knew of things that would\r\nmake your hair stand up. Gervaise listened in silence, her face pale.\r\nIt was nearly seven years since she had heard a word about Lantier. She\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t realized what a strong curiosity she had as to what had become\r\nof the poor man, even though he had treated her badly. And she never\r\nwould have believed that just the mention of his name could put such a\r\nglowing warmth in the pit of her stomach. She certainly had no reason\r\nto be jealous of Adele any more but she rejoiced to think of her body\r\nall bruised from the beatings. She could have listened to Virginie all\r\nnight, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask any questions, not wanting to appear much\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nVirginie stopped to sip at her coffee. Gervaise, realizing that she was\r\nexpected to say something, asked, with a pretence of indifference:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they still living at La Glaciere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d the other replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you? They separated last week.\r\nOne morning, Adele moved out and Lantier didn\xe2\x80\x99t chase after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they\xe2\x80\x99re separated!\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d Clemence asked, interrupting her\r\nconversation with mother Coupeau and Madame Putois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginie.\r\n\r\nShe was looking at Gervaise carefully and could see that she was upset.\r\nShe moved still closer, maliciously finding pleasure in bringing up\r\nthese old stories. Of a sudden she asked Gervaise what she would do if\r\nLantier came round here. Men were really such strange creatures, he\r\nmight decide to return to his first love. This caused Gervaise to sit\r\nup very straight and dignified. She was a married woman; she would send\r\nLantier off immediately. There was no possibility of anything further\r\nbetween them, not even a handshake. She would not even want to look\r\nthat man in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that Etienne is his son, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship that\r\nremains,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Lantier wants to see his son, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send the boy\r\nto him because you can\xe2\x80\x99t stop a father from seeing his child. But as\r\nfor myself, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to touch me even with the tip of his\r\nfinger. That is all finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDesiring to break off this conversation, she seemed to awake with a\r\nstart and called out to the women:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ladies! Do you think all these clothes are going to iron\r\nthemselves? Get to work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workwomen, slow from the heat and general laziness, didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurry\r\nthemselves, but went right on talking, gossiping about other people\r\nthey had known.\r\n\r\nGervaise shook herself and got to her feet. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t earn money by\r\nsitting all day. She was the first to return to the ironing, but found\r\nthat her curtains had been spotted by the coffee and she had to rub out\r\nthe stains with a damp cloth. The other women were now stretching and\r\ngetting ready to begin ironing.\r\n\r\nClemence had a terrible attack of coughing as soon as she moved.\r\nFinally she was able to return to the shirt she had been doing. Madame\r\nPutois began to work on the petticoat again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginie. \xe2\x80\x9cI only came out for a quarter-pound\r\nof Swiss cheese. Poisson must think I\xe2\x80\x99ve frozen to death on the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had only just stepped outside when she turned back to say that\r\nAugustine was at the end of the street, sliding on the ice with some\r\nurchins. The squint-eyed imp rushed in all red-faced and out of breath\r\nwith snow all in her hair. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the scolding she received,\r\nmerely saying that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to walk fast because of the ice\r\nand then some brats threw snow at her.\r\n\r\nThe afternoons were all the same these winter days. The laundry was the\r\nrefuge for anyone in the neighborhood who was cold. There was an\r\nendless procession of gossiping women. Gervaise took pride in the\r\ncomforting warmth of her shop and welcomed those who came in, \xe2\x80\x9cholding\r\na salon,\xe2\x80\x9d as the Lorilleuxs and the Boches remarked meanly.\r\n\r\nGervaise was always thoughtful and generous. Sometimes she even invited\r\npoor people in if she saw them shivering outside. A friendship sprang\r\nup with an elderly house-painter who was seventy. He lived in an attic\r\nroom and was slowly dying of cold and hunger. His three sons had been\r\nkilled in the war. He survived the best he could, but it had been two\r\nyears since he had been able to hold a paint-brush in his hand.\r\nWhenever Gervaise saw Pere Bru walking outside, she would call him in\r\nand arrange a place for him close to the stove. Often she gave him some\r\nbread and cheese. Pere Bru\xe2\x80\x99s face was as wrinkled as a withered apple.\r\nHe would sit there, with his stooping shoulders and his white beard,\r\nwithout saying a word, just listening to the coke sputtering in the\r\nstove. Maybe he was thinking of his fifty years of hard work on high\r\nladders, his fifty years spent painting doors and whitewashing ceilings\r\nin every corner of Paris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pere Bru,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise would say, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you thinking of now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much. All sorts of things,\xe2\x80\x9d he would answer quietly.\r\n\r\nThe workwomen tried to joke with him to cheer him up, saying he was\r\nworrying over his love affairs, but he scarcely listened to them before\r\nhe fell back into his habitual attitude of meditative melancholy.\r\n\r\nVirginie now frequently spoke to Gervaise of Lantier. She seemed to\r\nfind amusement in filling her mind with ideas of her old lover just for\r\nthe pleasure of embarrassing her by making suggestions. One day she\r\nrelated that she had met him; then, as the laundress took no notice,\r\nshe said nothing further, and it was only on the morrow that she added\r\nhe had spoken about her for a long time, and with a great show of\r\naffection. Gervaise was much upset by these reports whispered in her\r\near in a corner of the shop. The mention of Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s name always\r\ncaused a worried sensation in the pit of her stomach. She certainly\r\nthought herself strong; she wished to lead the life of an industrious\r\nwoman, because labor is the half of happiness. So she never considered\r\nCoupeau in this matter, having nothing to reproach herself with as\r\nregarded her husband, not even in her thoughts. But with a hesitating\r\nand suffering heart, she would think of the blacksmith. It seemed to\r\nher that the memory of Lantier\xe2\x80\x94that slow possession which she was\r\nresuming\xe2\x80\x94rendered her unfaithful to Goujet, to their unavowed love,\r\nsweet as friendship. She passed sad days whenever she felt herself\r\nguilty towards her good friend. She would have liked to have had no\r\naffection for anyone but him outside of her family. It was a feeling\r\nfar above all carnal thoughts, for the signs of which upon her burning\r\nface Virginie was ever on the watch.\r\n\r\nAs soon as spring came Gervaise often went and sought refuge with\r\nGoujet. She could no longer sit musing on a chair without immediately\r\nthinking of her first lover; she pictured him leaving Adele, packing\r\nhis clothes in the bottom of their old trunk, and returning to her in a\r\ncab. The days when she went out, she was seized with the most foolish\r\nfears in the street; she was ever thinking she heard Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfootsteps behind her. She did not dare turn round, but tremblingly\r\nfancied she felt his hands seizing her round the waist. He was, no\r\ndoubt, spying upon her; he would appear before her some afternoon; and\r\nthe bare idea threw her into a cold perspiration, because he would to a\r\ncertainty kiss her on the ear, as he used to do in former days solely\r\nto tease her. It was this kiss which frightened her; it rendered her\r\ndeaf beforehand; it filled her with a buzzing amidst which she could\r\nonly distinguish the sound of her heart beating violently. So, as soon\r\nas these fears seized upon her, the forge was her only shelter; there,\r\nunder Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s protection, she once more became easy and smiling, as\r\nhis sonorous hammer drove away her disagreeable reflections.\r\n\r\nWhat a happy time! The laundress took particular pains with the washing\r\nof her customer in the Rue des Portes-Blanches; she always took it home\r\nherself because that errand, every Friday, was a ready excuse for\r\npassing through the Rue Marcadet and looking in at the forge. The\r\nmoment she turned the corner of the street she felt light and gay, as\r\nthough in the midst of those plots of waste land surrounded by grey\r\nfactories, she were out in the country; the roadway black with\r\ncoal-dust, the plumage of steam over the roofs, amused her as much as a\r\nmoss-covered path leading through masses of green foliage in a wood in\r\nthe environs; and she loved the dull horizon, streaked by the tall\r\nfactory-chimneys, the Montmartre heights, which hid the heavens from\r\nview, the chalky white houses pierced with the uniform openings of\r\ntheir windows. She would slacken her steps as she drew near, jumping\r\nover the pools of water, and finding a pleasure in traversing the\r\ndeserted ins and outs of the yard full of old building materials. Right\r\nat the further end the forge shone with a brilliant light, even at\r\nmid-day. Her heart leapt with the dance of the hammers. When she\r\nentered, her face turned quite red, the little fair hairs at the nape\r\nof her neck flew about like those of a woman arriving at some lovers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmeeting. Goujet was expecting her, his arms and chest bare, whilst he\r\nhammered harder on the anvil on those days so as to make himself heard\r\nat a distance. He divined her presence, and greeted her with a good\r\nsilent laugh in his yellow beard. But she would not let him leave off\r\nhis work; she begged him to take up his hammer again, because she loved\r\nhim the more when he wielded it with his big arms swollen with muscles.\r\nShe would go and give Etienne a gentle tap on the cheek, as he hung on\r\nto the bellows, and then remain for an hour watching the rivets.\r\n\r\nThe two did not exchange a dozen words. They could not have more\r\ncompletely satisfied their love if alone in a room with the door\r\ndouble-locked. The snickering of Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, did not bother them in the least, for they no\r\nlonger even heard him. At the end of a quarter of an hour she would\r\nbegin to feel slightly oppressed; the heat, the powerful smell, the\r\nascending smoke, made her dizzy, whilst the dull thuds of the hammers\r\nshook her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. Then she\r\ndesired nothing more; it was her pleasure. Had Goujet pressed her in\r\nhis arms it would not have procured her so sweet an emotion. She drew\r\nclose to him that she might feel the wind raised by his hammer beat\r\nupon her cheek, and become, as it were, a part of the blow he struck.\r\nWhen the sparks made her soft hands smart, she did not withdraw them;\r\non the contrary, she enjoyed the rain of fire which stung her skin. He\r\nfor certain, divined the happiness which she tasted there; he always\r\nkept the most difficult work for the Fridays, so as to pay his court to\r\nher with all his strength and all his skill; he no longer spared\r\nhimself at the risk of splitting the anvils in two, as he panted and\r\nhis loins vibrated with the joy he was procuring her. All one\r\nspring-time their love thus filled Goujet with the rumbling of a storm.\r\nIt was an idyll amongst giant-like labor in the midst of the glare of\r\nthe coal fire, and of the shaking of the shed, the cracking carcass of\r\nwhich was black with soot. All that beaten iron, kneaded like red wax,\r\npreserved the rough marks of their love. When on the Fridays the\r\nlaundress parted from Golden-Mug, she slowly reascended the Rue des\r\nPoissonniers, contented and tired, her mind and her body alike\r\ntranquil.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, her fear of Lantier diminished; her good sense got\r\nthe better of her. At that time she would still have led a happy life,\r\nhad it not been for Coupeau, who was decidedly going to the bad. One\r\nday she just happened to be returning from the forge, when she fancied\r\nshe recognized Coupeau inside Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir, in the act of\r\ntreating himself to a round of vitriol in the company of My-Boots,\r\nBibi-the-Smoker, and Salted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst. She\r\npassed quickly by, so as not to seem to be spying on them. But she\r\nglanced back; it was indeed Coupeau who was tossing his little glass of\r\nbad brandy down his throat with a gesture already familiar. He lied\r\nthen; so he went in for brandy now! She returned home in despair; all\r\nher old dread of brandy took possession of her. She forgave the wine,\r\nbecause wine nourishes the workman; all kinds of spirit, on the\r\ncontrary, were filth, poisons which destroyed in the workman the taste\r\nfor bread. Ah! the government ought to prevent the manufacture of such\r\nhorrid stuff!\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, she found the whole house\r\nupset. Her workwomen had left the shop, and were in the courtyard\r\nlooking up above. She questioned Clemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s old Bijard who\xe2\x80\x99s giving his wife a hiding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the ironer.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in the doorway, as drunk as a trooper, watching for her return\r\nfrom the wash-house. He whacked her up the stairs, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinishing her off up there in their room. Listen, can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear her\r\nshrieks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise hastened to the spot. She felt some friendship for her\r\nwasher-woman, Madame Bijard, who was a very courageous woman. She had\r\nhoped to put a stop to what was going on. Upstairs, on the sixth floor\r\nthe door of the room was wide open, some lodgers were shouting on the\r\nlanding, whilst Madame Boche, standing in front of the door, was\r\ncalling out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you leave off? I shall send for the police; do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one dared to venture inside the room, because it was known that\r\nBijard was like a brute beast when he was drunk. As a matter of fact,\r\nhe was scarcely ever sober. The rare days on which he worked, he placed\r\na bottle of brandy beside his blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s vise, gulping some of it\r\ndown every half hour. He could not keep himself going any other way. He\r\nwould have blazed away like a torch if anyone had placed a lighted\r\nmatch close to his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t let her be murdered!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, all in a tremble.\r\n\r\nAnd she entered. The room, an attic, and very clean, was bare and cold,\r\nalmost emptied by the drunken habits of the man, who took the very\r\nsheets from the bed to turn them into liquor. During the struggle the\r\ntable had rolled away to the window, the two chairs, knocked over, had\r\nfallen with their legs in the air. In the middle of the room, on the\r\ntile floor, lay Madame Bijard, all bloody, her skirts, still soaked\r\nwith the water of the wash-house, clinging to her thighs, her hair\r\nstraggling in disorder. She was breathing heavily, with a rattle in her\r\nthroat, as she muttered prolonged ohs! each time she received a blow\r\nfrom the heel of Bijard\xe2\x80\x99s boot. He had knocked her down with his fists,\r\nand now he stamped upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, strumpet! Ah, strumpet! Ah strumpet!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted he in a choking\r\nvoice, accompanying each blow with the word, taking a delight in\r\nrepeating it, and striking all the harder the more he found his voice\r\nfailing him.\r\n\r\nThen when he could no longer speak, he madly continued to kick with a\r\ndull sound, rigid in his ragged blue blouse and overalls, his face\r\nturned purple beneath his dirty beard, and his bald forehead streaked\r\nwith big red blotches. The neighbors on the landing related that he was\r\nbeating her because she had refused him twenty sous that morning.\r\nBoche\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard at the foot of the staircase. He was calling\r\nMadame Boche, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down; let them kill each other, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be so much scum the less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Pere Bru had followed Gervaise into the room. Between them\r\nthey were trying to get him towards the door. But he turned round,\r\nspeechless and foaming at the lips, and in his pale eyes the alcohol\r\nwas blazing with a murderous glare. The laundress had her wrist\r\ninjured; the old workman was knocked against the table. On the floor,\r\nMadame Bijard was breathing with greater difficulty, her mouth wide\r\nopen, her eyes closed. Now Bijard kept missing her. He had madly\r\nreturned to the attack, but blinded by rage, his blows fell on either\r\nside, and at times he almost fell when his kicks went into space. And\r\nduring all this onslaught, Gervaise beheld in a corner of the room\r\nlittle Lalie, then four years old, watching her father murdering her\r\nmother. The child held in her arms, as though to protect her, her\r\nsister Henriette, only recently weaned. She was standing up, her head\r\ncovered with a cotton cap, her face very pale and grave. Her large\r\nblack eyes gazed with a fixedness full of thought and were without a\r\ntear.\r\n\r\nWhen at length Bijard, running against a chair, stumbled onto the tiled\r\nfloor, where they left him snoring, Pere Bru helped Gervaise to raise\r\nMadame Bijard. The latter was now sobbing bitterly; and Lalie, drawing\r\nnear, watched her crying, being used to such sights and already\r\nresigned to them. As the laundress descended the stairs, in the silence\r\nof the now quieted house, she kept seeing before her that look of this\r\nchild of four, as grave and courageous as that of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Coupeau is on the other side of the street,\xe2\x80\x9d called out\r\nClemence as soon as she caught sight of her. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks awfully drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau was just then crossing the street. He almost smashed a pane of\r\nglass with his shoulder as he missed the door. He was in a state of\r\ncomplete drunkenness, with his teeth clinched and his nose inflamed.\r\nAnd Gervaise at once recognized the vitriol of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir in the\r\npoisoned blood which paled his skin. She tried to joke and get him to\r\nbed, the same as on the days when the wine had made him merry; but he\r\npushed her aside without opening his lips, and raised his fist in\r\npassing as he went to bed of his own accord. He made Gervaise think of\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x94the drunkard who was snoring upstairs, tired out by the blows\r\nhe had struck. A cold shiver passed over her. She thought of the men\r\nshe knew\xe2\x80\x94of her husband, of Goujet, of Lantier\xe2\x80\x94her heart breaking,\r\ndespairing of ever being happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s saint\xe2\x80\x99s day fell on the 19th of June. On such occasions, the\r\nCoupeaus always made a grand display; they feasted till they were as\r\nround as balls, and their stomachs were filled for the rest of the\r\nweek. There was a complete clear out of all the money they had. The\r\nmoment there were a few sous in the house they went in gorging. They\r\ninvented saints for those days which the almanac had not provided with\r\nany, just for the sake of giving themselves a pretext for gormandizing.\r\nVirginie highly commended Gervaise for stuffing herself with all sorts\r\nof savory dishes. When one has a husband who turns all he can lay hands\r\non into drink, it\xe2\x80\x99s good to line one\xe2\x80\x99s stomach well, and not to let\r\neverything go off in liquids. Since the money would disappear anyway,\r\nsurely it was better to pay it to the butcher. Gervaise used that\r\nexcuse to justify overeating, saying it was Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s fault if they\r\ncould no longer save a sou. She had grown considerably fatter, and she\r\nlimped more than before because her leg, now swollen with fat, seemed\r\nto be getting gradually shorter.\r\n\r\nThat year they talked about her saint\xe2\x80\x99s day a good month beforehand.\r\nThey thought of dishes and smacked their lips in advance. All the shop\r\nhad a confounded longing to junket. They wanted a merry-making of the\r\nright sort\xe2\x80\x94something out of the ordinary and highly successful. One\r\ndoes not have so many opportunities for enjoyment. What most troubled\r\nthe laundress was to decide whom to invite; she wished to have twelve\r\npersons at table, no more, no less. She, her husband, mother Coupeau,\r\nand Madame Lerat, already made four members of the family. She would\r\nalso have the Goujets and the Poissons. Originally, she had decided not\r\nto invite her workwomen, Madame Putois and Clemence, so as not to make\r\nthem too familiar; but as the projected feast was being constantly\r\nspoken of in their presence, and their mouths watered, she ended by\r\ntelling them to come. Four and four, eight, and two are ten. Then,\r\nwishing particularly to have twelve, she became reconciled with the\r\nLorilleuxs, who for some time past had been hovering around her; at\r\nleast it was agreed that the Lorilleuxs should come to dinner, and that\r\npeace should be made with glasses in hand. You really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nfamily quarrels going forever. When the Boches heard that a\r\nreconciliation was planned, they also sought to make up with Gervaise,\r\nand so they had to be invited to the dinner too. That would make\r\nfourteen, not counting the children. Never before had she given such a\r\nlarge dinner and the thought frightened and excited her at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe saint\xe2\x80\x99s day happened to fall on a Monday. It was a piece of luck.\r\nGervaise counted on the Sunday afternoon to begin the cooking. On the\r\nSaturday, whilst the workwomen hurried with their work, there was a\r\nlong discussion in the shop with the view of finally deciding upon what\r\nthe feast should consist of. For three weeks past one thing alone had\r\nbeen chosen\xe2\x80\x94a fat roast goose. There was a gluttonous look on every\r\nface whenever it was mentioned. The goose was even already bought.\r\nMother Coupeau went and fetched it to let Clemence and Madame Putois\r\nfeel its weight. And they uttered all kinds of exclamations; it looked\r\nsuch an enormous bird, with its rough skin all swelled out with yellow\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore that there will be the pot-au-feu,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cthe soup\r\nand just a small piece of boiled beef, it\xe2\x80\x99s always good. Then we must\r\nhave something in the way of a stew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTall Clemence suggested rabbit, but they were always having that,\r\neveryone was sick of it. Gervaise wanted something more distinguished.\r\nMadame Putois having spoken of stewed veal, they looked at one another\r\nwith broad smiles. It was a real idea, nothing would make a better\r\nimpression than a veal stew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after that,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must have some other dish with\r\na sauce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau proposed fish. But the others made a grimace, as they\r\nbanged down their irons. None of them liked fish; it was not a bit\r\nsatisfying; and besides that it was full of bones. Squint-eyed\r\nAugustine, having dared to observe that she liked skate, Clemence shut\r\nher mouth for her with a good sound clout. At length the mistress\r\nthought of stewed pig\xe2\x80\x99s back and potatoes, which restored the smiles to\r\nevery countenance. Then Virginie entered like a puff of wind, with a\r\nstrange look on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come just at the right time!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cMother\r\nCoupeau, do show her the bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd mother Coupeau went a second time and fetched the goose, which\r\nVirginie had to take in her hands. She uttered no end of exclamations.\r\nBy Jove! It was heavy! But she soon laid it down on the work-table,\r\nbetween a petticoat and a bundle of shirts. Her thoughts were\r\nelsewhere. She dragged Gervaise into the back-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she rapidly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to warn you.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess who I just met at the corner of the street. Lantier,\r\nmy dear! He\xe2\x80\x99s hovering about on the watch; so I hastened here at once.\r\nIt frightened me on your account, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laundress turned quite pale. What could the wretched man want with\r\nher? Coming, too, like that, just in the midst of the preparations for\r\nthe feast. She had never had any luck; she could not even be allowed to\r\nenjoy herself quietly. But Virginie replied that she was very foolish\r\nto put herself out about it like that. Why! If Lantier dared to follow\r\nher about, all she had to do was to call a policeman and have him\r\nlocked up. In the month since her husband had been appointed a\r\npoliceman, Virginie had assumed rather lordly manners and talked of\r\narresting everybody. She began to raise her voice, saying that she\r\nwished some passer-by would pinch her bottom so that she could take the\r\nfresh fellow to the police station herself and turn him over to her\r\nhusband. Gervaise signaled her to be quiet since the workwomen were\r\nlistening and led the way back into the shop, reopening the discussion\r\nabout the dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t we need a vegetable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not peas with bacon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Virginie. \xe2\x80\x9cI like nothing better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, peas with bacon.\xe2\x80\x9d The others approved. Augustine was so\r\nenthusiastic that she jabbed the poker into the stove harder than ever.\r\n\r\nBy three o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the morrow, Sunday, mother Coupeau had lighted\r\ntheir two stoves and also a third one of earthenware which they had\r\nborrowed from the Boches. At half-past three the pot-au-feu was boiling\r\naway in an enormous earthenware pot lent by the eating-house keeper\r\nnext door, the family pot having been found too small. They had decided\r\nto cook the veal and the pig\xe2\x80\x99s back the night before, since both of\r\nthose dishes are better when reheated. But the cream sauce for the veal\r\nwould not be prepared until just before sitting down for the feast.\r\n\r\nThere was still plenty of work left for Monday: the soup, the peas with\r\nbacon, the roast goose. The inner room was lit by three fires. Butter\r\nwas sizzling in the pans and emitting a sharp odor of burnt flour.\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau and Gervaise, with white aprons tied on, were bustling\r\nall around, cleaning parsley, dashing for salt and pepper, turning the\r\nmeat. They had sent Coupeau away so as not to have him underfoot, but\r\nthey still had plenty of people looking in throughout the afternoon.\r\nThe luscious smells from the kitchen had spread through the entire\r\nbuilding so that neighboring ladies came into the shop on various\r\npretexts, very curious to see what was being cooked.\r\n\r\nVirginie put in an appearance towards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. She had again seen\r\nLantier; really, it was impossible to go down the street now without\r\nmeeting him. Madame Boche also had just caught sight of him standing at\r\nthe corner of the pavement with his head thrust forward in an\r\nuncommonly sly manner. Then Gervaise who had at that moment intended\r\ngoing for a sou\xe2\x80\x99s worth of burnt onions for the pot-au-feu, began to\r\ntremble from head to foot and did not dare leave the house; the more\r\nso, as the concierge and the dressmaker put her into a terrible fright\r\nby relating horrible stories of men waiting for women with knives and\r\npistols hidden beneath their overcoats. Well, yes! one reads of such\r\nthings every day in the newspapers. When one of those scoundrels gets\r\nhis monkey up on discovering an old love leading a happy life he\r\nbecomes capable of everything. Virginie obligingly offered to run and\r\nfetch the burnt onions. Women should always help one another, they\r\ncould not let that little thing be murdered. When she returned she said\r\nthat Lantier was no longer there; he had probably gone off on finding\r\nhe was discovered. In spite of that thought, he was the subject of\r\nconversation around the saucepans until night-time. When Madame Boche\r\nadvised her to inform Coupeau, Gervaise became really terrified, and\r\nimplored her not to say a word about it. Oh, yes, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be a\r\nnice situation! Her husband must have become suspicious already because\r\nfor the last few days, at night, he would swear to himself and bang the\r\nwall with his fists. The mere thought that the two men might destroy\r\neach other because of her made her shudder. She knew that Coupeau was\r\njealous enough to attack Lantier with his shears.\r\n\r\nWhile the four of them had been deep in contemplating this drama, the\r\nsaucepans on the banked coals of the stoves had been quietly simmering.\r\nWhen mother Coupeau lifted the lids, the veal and the pig\xe2\x80\x99s back were\r\ndiscreetly bubbling. The pot-au-feu was steadily steaming with\r\nsnore-like sounds. Eventually each of them dipped a piece of bread into\r\nthe soup to taste the bouillon.\r\n\r\nAt length Monday arrived. Now that Gervaise was going to have fourteen\r\npersons at table, she began to fear that she would not be able to find\r\nroom for them all. She decided that they should dine in the shop; and\r\nthe first thing in the morning she took measurements so as to settle\r\nwhich way she should place the table. After that they had to remove all\r\nthe clothes and take the ironing-table to pieces; the top of this laid\r\non to some shorter trestles was to be the dining-table. But just in the\r\nmidst of all this moving a customer appeared and made a scene because\r\nshe had been waiting for her washing ever since the Friday; they were\r\nhumbugging her, she would have her things at once. Then Gervaise tried\r\nto excuse herself and lied boldly; it was not her fault, she was\r\ncleaning out her shop, the workmen would not be there till the morrow;\r\nand she pacified her customer and got rid of her by promising to busy\r\nherself with her things at the earliest possible moment. Then, as soon\r\nas the woman had left, she showed her temper. Really, if you listened\r\nto all your customers, you\xe2\x80\x99d never have time to eat. You could work\r\nyourself to death like a dog on a leash! Well! No matter who came in\r\nto-day, even if they offered one hundred thousand francs, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntouch an iron on this Monday, because it was her turn to enjoy herself.\r\n\r\nThe entire morning was spent in completing the purchases. Three times\r\nGervaise went out and returned laden like a mule. But just as she was\r\ngoing to order wine she noticed that she had not sufficient money left.\r\nShe could easily have got it on credit; only she could not be without\r\nmoney in the house, on account of the thousand little expenses that one\r\nis liable to forget. And mother Coupeau and she had lamented together\r\nin the back-room as they reckoned that they required at least twenty\r\nfrancs. How could they obtain them, those four pieces of a hundred sous\r\neach? Mother Coupeau who had at one time done the charring for a little\r\nactress of the Theatre des Batignolles, was the first to suggest the\r\npawn-shop. Gervaise laughed with relief. How stupid she was not to have\r\nthought of it! She quickly folded her black silk dress upon a towel\r\nwhich she then pinned together. Then she hid the bundle under mother\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s apron, telling her to keep it very flat against her stomach,\r\non account of the neighbors who had no need to know; and she went and\r\nwatched at the door to see that the old woman was not followed. But the\r\nlatter had only gone as far as the charcoal dealer\xe2\x80\x99s when she called\r\nher back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made her return to the shop, and taking her wedding-ring off her\r\nfinger said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, put this with it. We shall get all the more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen mother Coupeau brought her twenty-five francs, she danced for joy.\r\nShe would order an extra six bottles of wine, sealed wine to drink with\r\nthe roast. The Lorilleuxs would be crushed.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight past it had been the Coupeaus\xe2\x80\x99 dream to crush the\r\nLorilleuxs. Was it not true that those sly ones, the man and his wife,\r\na truly pretty couple, shut themselves up whenever they had anything\r\nnice to eat as though they had stolen it? Yes, they covered up the\r\nwindow with a blanket to hide the light and make believe that they were\r\nalready asleep in bed. This stopped anyone from coming up, and so the\r\nLorilleuxs could stuff everything down, just the two of them. They were\r\neven careful the next day not to throw the bones into the garbage so\r\nthat no one would know what they had eaten. Madame Lorilleux would walk\r\nto the end of the street to toss them into a sewer opening. One morning\r\nGervaise surprised her emptying a basket of oyster shells there. Oh,\r\nthose penny-pinchers were never open-handed, and all their mean\r\ncontrivances came from their desire to appear to be poor. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nshow them, we\xe2\x80\x99d prove to them that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t mean.\r\n\r\nGervaise would have laid her table in the street, had she been able to,\r\njust for the sake of inviting each passer-by. Money was not invented\r\nthat it should be allowed to grow moldy, was it? It is pretty when it\r\nshines all new in the sunshine. She resembled them so little now, that\r\non the days when she had twenty sous she arranged things to let people\r\nthink that she had forty.\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau and Gervaise talked of the Lorilleuxs whilst they laid\r\nthe cloth about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. They had hung some big curtains at the\r\nwindows; but as it was very warm the door was left open and the whole\r\nstreet passed in front of the little table. The two women did not place\r\na decanter, or a bottle, or a salt-cellar, without trying to arrange\r\nthem in such a way as to annoy the Lorilleuxs. They had arranged their\r\nseats so as to give them a full view of the superbly laid cloth, and\r\nthey had reserved the best crockery for them, well knowing that the\r\nporcelain plates would create a great effect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gervaise; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t give them those napkins! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntwo damask ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, good!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the old woman; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99ll break their hearts, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they smiled to each other as they stood up on either side of that\r\nbig white table on which the fourteen knives and forks, placed all\r\nround, caused them to swell with pride. It had the appearance of the\r\naltar of some chapel in the middle of the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99re so stingy themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow they lied last month when the woman went about everywhere saying\r\nthat she had lost a piece of gold chain as she was taking the work\r\nhome. The idea! There\xe2\x80\x99s no fear of her ever losing anything! It was\r\nsimply a way of making themselves out very poor and of not giving you\r\nyour five francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen my five francs twice,\xe2\x80\x9d said mother Coupeau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bet next month they\xe2\x80\x99ll concoct some other story. That explains\r\nwhy they cover their window up when they have a rabbit to eat. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see? One would have the right to say to them: \xe2\x80\x98As you can afford a\r\nrabbit you can certainly give five francs to your mother!\xe2\x80\x99 Oh! they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\njust rotten! What would have become of you if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken you to\r\nlive with us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau slowly shook her head. That day she was all against the\r\nLorilleuxs, because of the great feast the Coupeaus were giving. She\r\nloved cooking, the little gossipings round the saucepans, the place\r\nturned topsy-turvy by the revels of saints\xe2\x80\x99 days. Besides she generally\r\ngot on pretty well with Gervaise. On other days when they plagued one\r\nanother as happens in all families, the old woman grumbled saying she\r\nwas wretchedly unfortunate in thus being at her daughter-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmercy. In point of fact she probably had some affection for Madame\r\nLorilleux who after all was her daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so fat, would you, if you\r\nwere living with them? And no coffee, no snuff, no little luxuries of\r\nany sort! Tell me, would they have given you two mattresses to your\r\nbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s very certain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied mother Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they arrive I\r\nshall place myself so as to have a good view of the door to see the\r\nfaces they\xe2\x80\x99ll make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThinking of the faces they would make gave them pleasure ahead of time.\r\nHowever, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remain standing there admiring the table. The\r\nCoupeaus had lunched very late on just a bite or two, because the\r\nstoves were already in use, and because they did not want to dirty any\r\ndishes needed for the evening. By four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the two women were\r\nworking very hard. The huge goose was being cooked on a spit.\r\nSquint-eyed Augustine was sitting on a low bench solemnly basting the\r\ngoose with a long-handled spoon. Gervaise was busy with the peas with\r\nbacon. Mother Coupeau, kept spinning around, a bit confused, waiting\r\nfor the right time to begin reheating the pork and the veal.\r\n\r\nTowards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock the guests began to arrive. First of all came the\r\ntwo workwomen, Clemence and Madame Putois, both in their Sunday best,\r\nthe former in blue, the latter in black; Clemence carried a geranium,\r\nMadame Putois a heliotrope, and Gervaise, whose hands were just then\r\nsmothered with flour, had to kiss each of them on both cheeks with her\r\narms behind her back. Then following close upon their heels entered\r\nVirginie dressed like a lady in a printed muslin costume with a sash\r\nand a bonnet though she had only a few steps to come. She brought a pot\r\nof red carnations. She took the laundress in her big arms and squeezed\r\nher tight. At length Boche appeared with a pot of pansies and Madame\r\nBoche with a pot of mignonette; then came Madame Lerat with a\r\nbalm-mint, the pot of which had dirtied her violet merino dress. All\r\nthese people kissed each other and gathered together in the back-room\r\nin the midst of the three stoves and the roasting apparatus, which gave\r\nout a stifling heat. The noise from the saucepans drowned the voices. A\r\ndress catching in the Dutch oven caused quite an emotion. The smell of\r\nroast goose was so strong that it made their mouths water. And Gervaise\r\nwas very pleasant, thanking everyone for their flowers without however\r\nletting that interfere with her preparing the thickening for the stewed\r\nveal at the bottom of a soup plate. She had placed the pots in the shop\r\nat one end of the table without removing the white paper that was round\r\nthem. A sweet scent of flowers mingled with the odor of cooking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want any assistance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Virginie. \xe2\x80\x9cJust fancy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nthree days preparing all this feast and it will be gobbled up in no\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prepare itself. No,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t dirty your hands. You see everything\xe2\x80\x99s ready. There\xe2\x80\x99s only the\r\nsoup to warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they all made themselves comfortable. The ladies laid their shawls\r\nand their caps on the bed and pinned up their skirts so as not to soil\r\nthem. Boche sent his wife back to the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s lodge until time to\r\neat and had cornered Clemence in a corner trying to find out if she was\r\nticklish. She was gasping for breath, as the mere thought of being\r\ntickled sent shivers through her. So as not to bother the cooks, the\r\nother ladies had gone into the shop and were standing against the wall\r\nfacing the table. They were talking through the door though, and as\r\nthey could not hear very well, they were continually invading the\r\nback-room and crowding around Gervaise, who would forget what she was\r\ndoing to answer them.\r\n\r\nThere were a few stories which brought sly laughter. When Virginie\r\nmentioned that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t eaten for two days in order to have more room\r\nfor today\xe2\x80\x99s feast, tall Clemence said that she had cleaned herself out\r\nthat morning with an enema like the English do. Then Boche suggested a\r\nway of digesting the food quickly by squeezing oneself after each\r\ncourse, another English custom. After all, when you were invited to\r\ndinner, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it polite to eat as much as you could? Veal and pork and\r\ngoose are placed out for the cats to eat. The hostess didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to\r\nworry a bit, they were going to clean their plates so thoroughly that\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wash them.\r\n\r\nAll of them kept coming to smell the air above the saucepans and the\r\nroaster. The ladies began to act like young girls, scurrying from room\r\nto room and pushing each other.\r\n\r\nJust as they were all jumping about and shouting by way of amusement,\r\nGoujet appeared. He was so timid he scarcely dared enter, but stood\r\nstill, holding a tall white rose-tree in his arms, a magnificent plant\r\nwith a stem that reached to his face and entangled the flowers in his\r\nbeard. Gervaise ran to him, her cheeks burning from the heat of the\r\nstoves. But he did not know how to get rid of his pot; and when she had\r\ntaken it from his hands he stammered, not daring to kiss her. It was\r\nshe who was obliged to stand on tip-toe and place her cheek against his\r\nlips; he was so agitated that even then he kissed her roughly on the\r\neye almost blinding her. They both stood trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Monsieur Goujet, it\xe2\x80\x99s too lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, placing the rose-tree\r\nbeside the other flowers which it overtopped with the whole of its tuft\r\nof foliage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, not at all!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he, unable to say anything else.\r\n\r\nThen, after sighing deeply, he slightly recovered himself and stated\r\nthat she was not to expect his mother; she was suffering from an attack\r\nof sciatica. Gervaise was greatly grieved; she talked of putting a\r\npiece of the goose on one side as she particularly wished Madame Goujet\r\nto have a taste of the bird. No one else was expected. Coupeau was no\r\ndoubt strolling about in the neighborhood with Poisson whom he had\r\ncalled for directly after his lunch; they would be home directly, they\r\nhad promised to be back punctually at six. Then as the soup was almost\r\nready, Gervaise called to Madame Lerat, saying that she thought it was\r\ntime to go and fetch the Lorilleuxs. Madame Lerat became at once very\r\ngrave; it was she who had conducted all the negotiations and who had\r\nsettled how everything should pass between the two families. She put\r\nher cap and shawl on again and went upstairs very stiffly in her\r\nskirts, looking very stately. Down below the laundress continued to\r\nstir her vermicelli soup without saying a word. The guests suddenly\r\nbecame serious and solemnly waited.\r\n\r\nIt was Madame Lerat who appeared first. She had gone round by the\r\nstreet so as to give more pomp to the reconciliation. She held the\r\nshop-door wide open whilst Madame Lorilleux, wearing a silk dress,\r\nstopped at the threshold. All the guests had risen from their seats;\r\nGervaise went forward and kissing her sister-in-law as had been agreed,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? We\xe2\x80\x99ll both be nice to each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Madame Lorilleux replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be only too happy if we\xe2\x80\x99re so always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she had entered Lorilleux also stopped at the threshold and he\r\nlikewise waited to be embraced before penetrating into the shop.\r\nNeither the one nor the other had brought a bouquet. They had decided\r\nnot to do so as they thought it would look too much like giving way to\r\nClump-clump if they carried flowers with them the first time they set\r\nfoot in her home. Gervaise called to Augustine to bring two bottles of\r\nwine. Then, filling some glasses on a corner of the table, she called\r\neveryone to her. And each took a glass and drank to the good friendship\r\nof the family. There was a pause whilst the guests were drinking, the\r\nladies raising their elbows and emptying their glasses to the last\r\ndrop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is better before soup,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Boche, smacking his lips.\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau had placed herself opposite the door to see the faces\r\nthe Lorilleuxs would make. She pulled Gervaise by the skirt and dragged\r\nher into the back-room. And as they both leant over the soup they\r\nconversed rapidly in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHuh! What a sight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see them; but I\r\nwas watching. When she caught sight of the table her face twisted\r\naround like that, the corners of her mouth almost touched her eyes; and\r\nas for him, it nearly choked him, he coughed and coughed. Now just look\r\nat them over there; they\xe2\x80\x99ve no saliva left in their mouths, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nchewing their lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite painful to see people as jealous as that,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured\r\nGervaise.\r\n\r\nReally the Lorilleuxs had a funny look about them. No one of course\r\nlikes to be crushed; in families especially when the one succeeds, the\r\nothers do not like it; that is only natural. Only one keeps it in, one\r\ndoes not make an exhibition of oneself. Well! The Lorilleuxs could not\r\nkeep it in. It was more than a match for them. They squinted\xe2\x80\x94their\r\nmouths were all on one side. In short it was so apparent that the other\r\nguests looked at them, and asked them if they were unwell. Never would\r\nthey be able to stomach this table with its fourteen place-settings,\r\nits white linen table cloth, its slices of bread cut in advance, all in\r\nthe style of a first-class restaurant. Mme. Lorilleux went around the\r\ntable, surreptitiously fingering the table cloth, tortured by the\r\nthought that it was a new one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s ready!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gervaise as she reappeared with a smile,\r\nher arms bare and her little fair curls blowing over her temples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the boss would only come,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the laundress, \xe2\x80\x9cwe might begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lorilleux, \xe2\x80\x9cthe soup will be cold by then.\r\nCoupeau always forgets. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have let him go off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was already half-past six. Everything was burning now; the goose\r\nwould be overdone. Then Gervaise, feeling quite dejected, talked of\r\nsending someone to all the wineshops in the neighborhood to find\r\nCoupeau. And as Goujet offered to go, she decided to accompany him.\r\nVirginie, anxious about her husband went also. The three of them,\r\nbareheaded, quite blocked up the pavement. The blacksmith who wore his\r\nfrock-coat, had Gervaise on his left arm and Virginie on his right; he\r\nwas doing the two-handled basket as he said; and it seemed to them such\r\na funny thing to say that they stopped, unable to move their legs for\r\nlaughing. They looked at themselves in the pork-butcher\xe2\x80\x99s glass and\r\nlaughed more than ever. Beside Goujet, all in black, the two women\r\nlooked like two speckled hens\xe2\x80\x94the dressmaker in her muslin costume,\r\nsprinkled with pink flowers, the laundress in her white cambric dress\r\nwith blue spots, her wrists bare, and wearing round her neck a little\r\ngrey silk scarf tied in a bow. People turned round to see them pass,\r\nlooking so fresh and lively, dressed in their Sunday best on a week day\r\nand jostling the crowd which hung about the Rue des Poissonniers, on\r\nthat warm June evening. But it was not a question of amusing\r\nthemselves. They went straight to the door of each wineshop, looked in\r\nand sought amongst the people standing before the counter. Had that\r\nanimal Coupeau gone to the Arc de Triomphe to get his dram? They had\r\nalready done the upper part of the street, looking in at all the likely\r\nplaces; at the \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Civet,\xe2\x80\x9d renowned for its preserved plums; at old\r\nmother Baquet\xe2\x80\x99s, who sold Orleans wine at eight sous; at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly,\xe2\x80\x9d the coachmen\xe2\x80\x99s house of call, gentlemen who were not easy\r\nto please. But no Coupeau. Then as they were going down towards the\r\nBoulevard, Gervaise uttered a faint cry on passing the eating-house at\r\nthe corner kept by Francois.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Goujet.\r\n\r\nThe laundress no longer laughed. She was very pale, and laboring under\r\nso great an emotion that she had almost fallen. Virginie understood it\r\nall as she caught a sight of Lantier seated at one of Francois\xe2\x80\x99s tables\r\nquietly dining. The two women dragged the blacksmith along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ankle twisted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise as soon as she was able to speak.\r\n\r\nAt length they discovered Coupeau and Poisson at the bottom of the\r\nstreet inside Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir. They were standing up in the\r\nmidst of a number of men; Coupeau, in a grey blouse, was shouting with\r\nfurious gestures and banging his fists down on the counter. Poisson,\r\nnot on duty that day and buttoned up in an old brown coat, was\r\nlistening to him in a dull sort of way and without uttering a word,\r\nbristling his carroty moustaches and beard the while. Goujet left the\r\nwomen on the edge of the pavement, and went and laid his hand on the\r\nzinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. But when the latter caught sight of Gervaise\r\nand Virginie outside he grew angry. Why was he badgered with such\r\nfemales as those? Petticoats had taken to tracking him about now! Well!\r\nHe declined to stir, they could go and eat their beastly dinner all by\r\nthemselves. To quiet him Goujet was obliged to accept a drop of\r\nsomething; and even then Coupeau took a fiendish delight in dawdling a\r\ngood five minutes at the counter. When he at length came out he said to\r\nhis wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like this. It\xe2\x80\x99s my business where I go. Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. She was all in a tremble. She must have said\r\nsomething about Lantier to Virginie, for the latter pushed her husband\r\nand Goujet ahead, telling them to walk in front. The two women got on\r\neach side of Coupeau to keep him occupied and prevent him seeing\r\nLantier. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really drunk, being more intoxicated from shouting\r\nthan from drinking. Since they seemed to want to stay on the left side,\r\nto tease them, he crossed over to the other side of the street.\r\nWorried, they ran after him and tried to block his view of the door of\r\nFrancois\xe2\x80\x99s. But Coupeau must have known that Lantier was there.\r\nGervaise almost went out of her senses on hearing him grunt:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my duck, there\xe2\x80\x99s a young fellow of our acquaintance inside there!\r\nYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t take me for a ninny. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me catch you gallivanting\r\nabout again with your side glances!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made use of some very coarse expressions. It was not him that\r\nshe had come to look for with her bare elbows and her mealy mouth; it\r\nwas her old beau. Then he was suddenly seized with a mad rage against\r\nLantier. Ah! the brigand! Ah! the filthy hound! One or the other of\r\nthem would have to be left on the pavement, emptied of his guts like a\r\nrabbit. Lantier, however, did not appear to notice what was going on\r\nand continued slowly eating some veal and sorrel. A crowd began to\r\nform. Virginie led Coupeau away and he calmed down at once as soon as\r\nhe had turned the corner of the street. All the same they returned to\r\nthe shop far less lively than when they left it.\r\n\r\nThe guests were standing round the table with very long faces. The\r\nzinc-worker shook hands with them, showing himself off before the\r\nladies. Gervaise, feeling rather depressed, spoke in a low voice as she\r\ndirected them to their places. But she suddenly noticed that, as Madame\r\nGoujet had not come, a seat would remain empty\xe2\x80\x94the one next to Madame\r\nLorilleux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are thirteen!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, deeply affected, seeing in that a fresh\r\nomen of the misfortune with which she had felt herself threatened for\r\nsome time past.\r\n\r\nThe ladies already seated rose up looking anxious and annoyed. Madame\r\nPutois offered to retire because according to her it was not a matter\r\nto laugh about; besides she would not touch a thing, the food would do\r\nher no good. As to Boche, he chuckled. He would sooner be thirteen than\r\nfourteen; the portions would be larger, that was all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cI can manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd going out on to the pavement she called Pere Bru who was just then\r\ncrossing the roadway. The old workman entered, stooping and stiff and\r\nhis face without expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeat yourself there, my good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the laundress. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind eating with us, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe simply nodded his head. He was willing; he did not mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs well him as another,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, lowering her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t often eat his fill. He will at least enjoy himself once more.\r\nWe shall feel no remorse in stuffing ourselves now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis touched Goujet so deeply that his eyes filled with tears. The\r\nothers were also moved by compassion and said that it would bring them\r\nall good luck. However, Madame Lorilleux seemed unhappy at having the\r\nold man next to her. She cast glances of disgust at his work-roughened\r\nhands and his faded, patched smock, and drew away from him.\r\n\r\nPere Bru sat with his head bowed, waiting. He was bothered by the\r\nnapkin that was on the plate before him. Finally he lifted it off and\r\nplaced it gently on the edge of the table, not thinking to spread it\r\nover his knees.\r\n\r\nNow at last Gervaise served the vermicelli soup; the guests were taking\r\nup their spoons when Virginie remarked that Coupeau had disappeared. He\r\nhad perhaps returned to Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s. This time the company got\r\nangry. So much the worse! One would not run after him; he could stay in\r\nthe street if he was not hungry; and as the spoons touched the bottom\r\nof the plates, Coupeau reappeared with two pots of flowers, one under\r\neach arm, a stock and a balsam. They all clapped their hands. He\r\ngallantly placed the pots, one on the right, the other on the left of\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s glass; then bending over and kissing her, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten you, my lamb. But in spite of that, we love each other\r\nall the same, especially on such a day as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s very nice this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Clemence in\r\nBoche\xe2\x80\x99s ear. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s just got what he required, sufficient to make him\r\namiable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good behavior of the master of the house restored the gaiety of the\r\nproceedings, which at one moment had been compromised. Gervaise, once\r\nmore at her ease, was all smiles again. The guests finished their soup.\r\nThen the bottles circulated and they drank their first glass of wine,\r\njust a drop pure, to wash down the vermicelli. One could hear the\r\nchildren quarrelling in the next room. There were Etienne, Pauline,\r\nNana and little Victor Fauconnier. It had been decided to lay a table\r\nfor the four of them, and they had been told to be very good. That\r\nsquint-eyed Augustine who had to look after the stoves was to eat off\r\nher knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly screamed Nana, \xe2\x80\x9cAugustine is dipping her bread\r\nin the Dutch oven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laundress hastened there and caught the squint-eyed one in the act\r\nof burning her throat in her attempts to swallow without loss of time a\r\nslice of bread soaked in boiling goose fat. She boxed her ears when the\r\nyoung monkey called out that it was not true. When, after the boiled\r\nbeef, the stewed veal appeared, served in a salad-bowl, as they did not\r\nhave a dish large enough, the party greeted it with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s becoming serious,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Poisson, who seldom spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven. They had closed the shop door, so as not to be\r\nspied upon by the whole neighborhood; the little clockmaker opposite\r\nespecially was opening his eyes to their full size and seemed to take\r\nthe pieces from their mouths with such a gluttonous look that it almost\r\nprevented them from eating. The curtains hung before the windows\r\nadmitted a great white uniform light which bathed the entire table with\r\nits symmetrical arrangement of knives and forks and its pots of flowers\r\nenveloped in tall collars of white paper; and this pale fading light,\r\nthis slowly approaching dusk, gave to the party somewhat of an air of\r\ndistinction. Virginie looked round the closed apartment hung with\r\nmuslin and with a happy criticism declared it to be very cozy. Whenever\r\na cart passed in the street the glasses jingled together on the table\r\ncloth and the ladies were obliged to shout out as loud as the men. But\r\nthere was not much conversation; they all behaved very respectably and\r\nwere very attentive to each other. Coupeau alone wore a blouse, because\r\nas he said one need not stand on ceremony with friends and besides\r\nwhich the blouse was the workman\xe2\x80\x99s garb of honor. The ladies, laced up\r\nin their bodices, wore their hair in plaits greasy with pomatum in\r\nwhich the daylight was reflected; whilst the gentlemen, sitting at a\r\ndistance from the table, swelled out their chests and kept their elbows\r\nwide apart for fear of staining their frock coats.\r\n\r\nAh! thunder! What a hole they were making in the stewed veal! If they\r\nspoke little, they were chewing in earnest. The salad-bowl was becoming\r\nemptier and emptier with a spoon stuck in the midst of the thick\r\nsauce\xe2\x80\x94a good yellow sauce which quivered like a jelly. They fished\r\npieces of veal out of it and seemed as though they would never come to\r\nthe end; the salad-bowl journeyed from hand to hand and faces bent over\r\nit as forks picked out the mushrooms. The long loaves standing against\r\nthe wall behind the guests appeared to melt away. Between the mouthfuls\r\none could hear the sound of glasses being replaced on the table. The\r\nsauce was a trifle too salty. It required four bottles of wine to drown\r\nthat blessed stewed veal, which went down like cream, but which\r\nafterwards lit up a regular conflagration in one\xe2\x80\x99s stomach. And before\r\none had time to take a breath, the pig\xe2\x80\x99s back, in the middle of a deep\r\ndish surrounded by big round potatoes, arrived in the midst of a cloud\r\nof smoke. There was one general cry. By Jove! It was just the thing!\r\nEveryone liked it. They would do it justice; and they followed the dish\r\nwith a side glance as they wiped their knives on their bread so as to\r\nbe in readiness. Then as soon as they were helped they nudged one\r\nanother and spoke with their mouths full. It was just like butter!\r\nSomething sweet and solid which one could feel run through one\xe2\x80\x99s guts\r\nright down into one\xe2\x80\x99s boots. The potatoes were like sugar. It was not a\r\nbit salty; only, just on account of the potatoes, it required a wetting\r\nevery few minutes. Four more bottles were placed on the table. The\r\nplates were wiped so clean that they also served for the green peas and\r\nbacon. Oh! vegetables were of no consequence. They playfully gulped\r\nthem down in spoonfuls. The best part of the dish was the small pieces\r\nof bacon just nicely grilled and smelling like horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoof. Two\r\nbottles were sufficient for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d called out Nana suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cAugustine\xe2\x80\x99s putting her\r\nfingers in my plate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother me! give her a slap!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gervaise, in the act of\r\nstuffing herself with green peas.\r\n\r\nAt the children\xe2\x80\x99s table in the back-room, Nana was playing the role of\r\nlady of the house, sitting next to Victor and putting her brother\r\nEtienne beside Pauline so they could play house, pretending they were\r\ntwo married couples. Nana had served her guests very politely at first,\r\nbut now she had given way to her passion for grilled bacon, trying to\r\nkeep every piece for herself. While Augustine was prowling around the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s table, she would grab the bits of bacon under the pretext of\r\ndividing them amongst the children. Nana was so furious that she bit\r\nAugustine on the wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you know,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Augustine, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell your mother that after\r\nthe veal you asked Victor to kiss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut all became quiet again as Gervaise and mother Coupeau came in to\r\nget the goose. The guests at the big table were leaning back in their\r\nchairs taking a breather. The men had unbuttoned their waistcoats, the\r\nladies were wiping their faces with their napkins. The repast was, so\r\nto say, interrupted; only one or two persons, unable to keep their jaws\r\nstill, continued to swallow large mouthfuls of bread, without even\r\nknowing that they were doing so. The others were waiting and allowing\r\ntheir food to settle while waiting for the main course. Night was\r\nslowly coming on; a dirty ashy grey light was gathering behind the\r\ncurtains. When Augustine brought two lamps and placed one at each end\r\nof the table, the general disorder became apparent in the bright\r\nglare\xe2\x80\x94the greasy forks and plates, the table cloth stained with wine\r\nand covered with crumbs. A strong stifling odor pervaded the room.\r\nCertain warm fumes, however, attracted all the noses in the direction\r\nof the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Virginie.\r\n\r\nShe left her chair and passed into the inner room. All the women\r\nfollowed one by one. They surrounded the Dutch oven, and watched with\r\nprofound interest as Gervaise and mother Coupeau tried to pull the bird\r\nout. Then a clamor arose, in the midst of which one could distinguish\r\nthe shrill voices and the joyful leaps of the children. And there was a\r\ntriumphal entry. Gervaise carried the goose, her arms stiff, and her\r\nperspiring face expanded in one broad silent laugh; the women walked\r\nbehind her, laughing in the same way; whilst Nana, right at the end,\r\nraised herself up to see, her eyes open to their full extent. When the\r\nenormous golden goose, streaming with gravy, was on the table, they did\r\nnot attack it at once. It was a wonder, a respectful wonderment, which\r\nfor a moment left everyone speechless. They drew one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention to it with winks and nods of the head. Golly! What a bird!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one didn\xe2\x80\x99t get fat by licking the walls, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boche.\r\n\r\nThen they entered into details respecting the bird. Gervaise gave the\r\nfacts. It was the best she could get at the poulterer\xe2\x80\x99s in the Faubourg\r\nPoissonniers; it weighed twelve and a half pounds on the scales at the\r\ncharcoal-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s; they had burnt nearly half a bushel of charcoal in\r\ncooking it, and it had given three bowls full of drippings.\r\n\r\nVirginie interrupted her to boast of having seen it before it was\r\ncooked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could have eaten it just as it was,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cits skin\r\nwas so fine, like the skin of a blonde.\xe2\x80\x9d All the men laughed at this,\r\nsmacking their lips. Lorilleux and Madame Lorilleux sniffed\r\ndisdainfully, almost choking with rage to see such a goose on\r\nClump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! We can\xe2\x80\x99t eat it whole,\xe2\x80\x9d the laundress observed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99ll cut it\r\nup? No, no, not me! It\xe2\x80\x99s too big; I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau offered his services. _Mon Dieu!_ it was very simple. You\r\ncaught hold of the limbs, and pulled them off; the pieces were good all\r\nthe same. But the others protested; they forcibly took possession of\r\nthe large kitchen knife which the zinc-worker already held in his hand,\r\nsaying that whenever he carved he made a regular graveyard of the\r\nplatter. Finally, Madame Lerat suggested in a friendly tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, it should be Monsieur Poisson; yes, Monsieur Poisson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, as the others did not appear to understand, she added in a more\r\nflattering manner still:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, of course, it should be Monsieur Poisson, who\xe2\x80\x99s accustomed\r\nto the use of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she passed the kitchen knife to the policeman. All round the table\r\nthey laughed with pleasure and approval. Poisson bowed his head with\r\nmilitary stiffness, and moved the goose before him. When he thrust the\r\nknife into the goose, which cracked, Lorilleux was seized with an\r\noutburst of patriotism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if it was a Cossack!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever fought with Cossacks, Monsieur Poisson?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame\r\nBoche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I have with Bedouins,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the policeman, who was cutting\r\noff a wing. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no more Cossacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA great silence ensued. Necks were stretched out as every eye followed\r\nthe knife. Poisson was preparing a surprise. Suddenly he gave a last\r\ncut; the hind-quarter of the bird came off and stood up on end, rump in\r\nthe air, making a bishop\xe2\x80\x99s mitre. Then admiration burst forth. None\r\nwere so agreeable in company as retired soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe policeman allowed several minutes for the company to admire the\r\nbishop\xe2\x80\x99s mitre and then finished cutting the slices and arranging them\r\non the platter. The carving of the goose was now complete.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies complained that they were getting rather warm, Coupeau\r\nopened the door to the street and the gaiety continued against the\r\nbackground of cabs rattling down the street and pedestrians bustling\r\nalong the pavement. The goose was attacked furiously by the rested\r\njaws. Boche remarked that just having to wait and watch the goose being\r\ncarved had been enough to make the veal and pork slide down to his\r\nankles.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a famous tuck-in; that is to say, not one of the party\r\nrecollected ever having before run the risk of such a stomach-ache.\r\nGervaise, looking enormous, her elbows on the table, ate great pieces\r\nof breast, without uttering a word, for fear of losing a mouthful, and\r\nmerely felt slightly ashamed and annoyed at exhibiting herself thus, as\r\ngluttonous as a cat before Goujet. Goujet, however, was too busy\r\nstuffing himself to notice that she was all red with eating. Besides,\r\nin spite of her greediness, she remained so nice and good! She did not\r\nspeak, but she troubled herself every minute to look after Pere Bru,\r\nand place some dainty bit on his plate. It was even touching to see\r\nthis glutton take a piece of wing almost from her mouth to give it to\r\nthe old fellow, who did not appear to be very particular, and who\r\nswallowed everything with bowed head, almost besotted from having\r\ngobbled so much after he had forgotten the taste of bread. The\r\nLorilleuxs expended their rage on the roast goose; they ate enough to\r\nlast them three days; they would have stowed away the dish, the table,\r\nthe very shop, if they could have ruined Clump-clump by doing so. All\r\nthe ladies had wanted a piece of the breast, traditionally the ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nportion. Madame Lerat, Madame Boche, Madame Putois, were all picking\r\nbones; whilst mother Coupeau, who adored the neck, was tearing off the\r\nflesh with her two last teeth. Virginie liked the skin when it was\r\nnicely browned, and the other guests gallantly passed their skin to\r\nher; so much so, that Poisson looked at his wife severely, and bade her\r\nstop, because she had had enough as it was. Once already, she had been\r\na fortnight in bed, with her stomach swollen out, through having eaten\r\ntoo much roast goose. But Coupeau got angry and helped Virginie to the\r\nupper part of a leg, saying that, by Jove\xe2\x80\x99s thunder! if she did not\r\npick it, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a proper woman. Had roast goose ever done harm to\r\nanybody? On the contrary, it cured all complaints of the spleen. One\r\ncould eat it without bread, like dessert. He could go on swallowing it\r\nall night without being the least bit inconvenienced; and, just to show\r\noff, he stuffed a whole drum-stick into his mouth. Meanwhile, Clemence\r\nhad got to the end of the rump, and was sucking it with her lips,\r\nwhilst she wriggled with laughter on her chair because Boche was\r\nwhispering all sorts of smutty things to her. Ah, by Jove! Yes, there\r\nwas a dinner! When one\xe2\x80\x99s at it, one\xe2\x80\x99s at it, you know; and if one only\r\nhas the chance now and then, one would be precious stupid not to stuff\r\noneself up to one\xe2\x80\x99s ears. Really, one could see their sides puff out by\r\ndegrees. They were cracking in their skins, the blessed gormandizers!\r\nWith their mouths open, their chins besmeared with grease, they had\r\nsuch bloated red faces that one would have said they were bursting with\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nAs for the wine, well, that was flowing as freely around the table as\r\nwater flows in the Seine. It was like a brook overflowing after a\r\nrainstorm when the soil is parched. Coupeau raised the bottle high when\r\npouring to see the red jet foam in the glass. Whenever he emptied a\r\nbottle, he would turn it upside down and shake it. One more dead\r\nsolder! In a corner of the laundry the pile of dead soldiers grew\r\nlarger and larger, a veritable cemetery of bottles onto which other\r\ndebris from the table was tossed.\r\n\r\nCoupeau became indignant when Madame Putois asked for water. He took\r\nall the water pitchers from the table. Do respectable citizens ever\r\ndrink water? Did she want to grow frogs in her stomach?\r\n\r\nMany glasses were emptied at one gulp. You could hear the liquid\r\ngurgling its way down the throats like rainwater in a drainpipe after a\r\nstorm. One might say it was raining wine. _Mon Dieu!_ the juice of the\r\ngrape was a remarkable invention. Surely the workingman couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nalong without his wine. Papa Noah must have planted his grapevine for\r\nthe benefit of zinc-workers, tailors and blacksmiths. It brightened you\r\nup and refreshed you after a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was in a high mood. He proclaimed that all the ladies present\r\nwere very cute, and jingled the three sous in his pocket as if they had\r\nbeen five-franc pieces.\r\n\r\nEven Goujet, who was ordinarily very sober, had taken plenty of wine.\r\nBoche\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were narrowing, those of Lorilleux were paling, and\r\nPoisson was developing expressions of stern severity on his soldierly\r\nface. All the men were as drunk as lords and the ladies had reached a\r\ncertain point also, feeling so warm that they had to loosen their\r\nclothes. Only Clemence carried this a bit too far.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Gervaise recollected the six sealed bottles of wine. She had\r\nforgotten to put them on the table with the goose; she fetched them,\r\nand all the glasses were filled. Then Poisson rose, and holding his\r\nglass in the air, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink to the health of the missus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll of them stood up, making a great noise with their chairs as they\r\nmoved. Holding out their arms, they clinked glasses in the midst of an\r\nimmense uproar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to this day fifty years hence!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Virginie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gervaise, deeply moved and smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be too\r\nold. Ah! a day comes when one\xe2\x80\x99s glad to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough the door, which was wide open, the neighborhood was looking on\r\nand taking part in the festivities. Passers-by stopped in the broad ray\r\nof light which shone over the pavement, and laughed heartily at seeing\r\nall these people stuffing away so jovially.\r\n\r\nThe aroma from the roasted goose brought joy to the whole street. The\r\nclerks on the sidewalk opposite thought they could almost taste the\r\nbird. Others came out frequently to stand in front of their shops,\r\nsniffing the air and licking their lips. The little jeweler was unable\r\nto work, dizzy from having counted so many bottles. He seemed to have\r\nlost his head among his merry little cuckoo clocks.\r\n\r\nYes, the neighbors were devoured with envy, as Coupeau said. But why\r\nshould there be any secret made about the matter? The party, now fairly\r\nlaunched, was no longer ashamed of being seen at table; on the\r\ncontrary, it felt flattered and excited at seeing the crowd gathered\r\nthere, gaping with gluttony; it would have liked to have knocked out\r\nthe shop-front and dragged the table into the road-way, and there to\r\nhave enjoyed the dessert under the very nose of the public, and amidst\r\nthe commotion of the thoroughfare. Nothing disgusting was to be seen in\r\nthem, was there? Then there was no need to shut themselves in like\r\nselfish people. Coupeau, noticing the little clockmaker looked very\r\nthirsty, held up a bottle; and as the other nodded his head, he carried\r\nhim the bottle and a glass. A fraternity was established in the street.\r\nThey drank to anyone who passed. They called in any chaps who looked\r\nthe right sort. The feast spread, extending from one to another, to the\r\ndegree that the entire neighborhood of the Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or sniffed the\r\ngrub, and held its stomach, amidst a rumpus worthy of the devil and all\r\nhis demons. For some minutes, Madame Vigouroux, the charcoal-dealer,\r\nhad been passing to and fro before the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Madame Vigouroux! Madame Vigouroux!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the party.\r\n\r\nShe entered with a broad grin on her face, which was washed for once,\r\nand so fat that the body of her dress was bursting. The men liked\r\npinching her, because they might pinch her all over without ever\r\nencountering a bone. Boche made room for her beside him and reached\r\nslyly under the table to grab her knee. But she, being accustomed to\r\nthat sort of thing, quietly tossed off a glass of wine, and related\r\nthat all the neighbors were at their windows, and that some of the\r\npeople of the house were beginning to get angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s our business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Boche. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re the concierges,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t we? Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re answerable for good order. Let them come and\r\ncomplain to us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll receive them in a way they don\xe2\x80\x99t expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the back-room there had just been a furious fight between Nana and\r\nAugustine, on account of the Dutch oven, which both wanted to scrape\r\nout. For a quarter of an hour, the Dutch oven had rebounded over the\r\ntile floor with the noise of an old saucepan. Nana was now nursing\r\nlittle Victor, who had a goose-bone in his throat. She pushed her\r\nfingers under his chin, and made him swallow big lumps of sugar by way\r\nof a remedy. That did not prevent her keeping an eye on the big table.\r\nAt every minute she came and asked for wine, bread, or meat, for\r\nEtienne and Pauline, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Burst!\xe2\x80\x9d her mother would say to her. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll leave us in\r\npeace now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children were scarcely able to swallow any longer, but they\r\ncontinued to eat all the same, banging their forks down on the table to\r\nthe tune of a canticle, in order to excite themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the noise, however, a conversation was going on between\r\nPere Bru and mother Coupeau. The old fellow, who was ghastly pale in\r\nspite of the wine and the food, was talking of his sons who had died in\r\nthe Crimea. Ah! if the lads had only lived, he would have had bread to\r\neat every day. But mother Coupeau, speaking thickly, leant towards him\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! one has many worries with children! For instance, I appear to be\r\nhappy here, don\xe2\x80\x99t I? Well! I cry more often than you think. No, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwish you still had your children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPere Bru shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get work anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m too old. When I enter a\r\nworkshop the young fellows joke, and ask me if I polished Henri IV.\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboots. To-day it\xe2\x80\x99s all over; they won\xe2\x80\x99t have me anywhere. Last year I\r\ncould still earn thirty sous a day painting a bridge. I had to lie on\r\nmy back with the river flowing under me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bad cough ever\r\nsince then. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m finished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at his poor stiff hands and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to understand, I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer good for anything. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nright; were I in their place I should do the same. You see, the\r\nmisfortune is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not dead. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. One should lie\r\ndown and croak when one\xe2\x80\x99s no longer able to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorilleux, who was listening, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why\r\nthe Government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the aid of the invalids of labor. I was\r\nreading that in a newspaper the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Poisson thought it his duty to defend the Government.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorkmen are not soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d declared he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Invalides is for\r\nsoldiers. You must not ask for what is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDessert was now served. In the centre of the table was a Savoy cake in\r\nthe form of a temple, with a dome fluted with melon slices; and this\r\ndome was surmounted by an artificial rose, close to which was a silver\r\npaper butterfly, fluttering at the end of a wire. Two drops of gum in\r\nthe centre of the flower imitated dew. Then, to the left, a piece of\r\ncream cheese floated in a deep dish; whilst in another dish to the\r\nright, were piled up some large crushed strawberries, with the juice\r\nrunning from them. However, there was still some salad left, some large\r\ncoss lettuce leaves soaked with oil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Madame Boche,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, coaxingly, \xe2\x80\x9ca little more salad. I\r\nknow how fond you are of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, thank you! I\xe2\x80\x99ve already had as much as I can manage,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nthe concierge.\r\n\r\nThe laundress turning towards Virginie, the latter put her finger in\r\nher mouth, as though to touch the food she had taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I\xe2\x80\x99m full,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no room left. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nswallow a mouthful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! but if you tried a little,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\ncan always find a tiny corner empty. Once doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be hungry to\r\nbe able to eat salad. You\xe2\x80\x99re surely not going to let this be wasted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can eat it to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lerat; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nicer when its\r\nwilted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ladies sighed as they looked regretfully at the salad-bowl.\r\nClemence related that she had one day eaten three bunches of\r\nwatercresses at her lunch. Madame Putois could do more than that, she\r\nwould take a coss lettuce and munch it up with some salt just as it was\r\nwithout separating the leaves. They could all have lived on salad,\r\nwould have treated themselves to tubfuls. And, this conversation\r\naiding, the ladies cleaned out the salad-bowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could go on all fours in a meadow,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the concierge with her\r\nmouth full.\r\n\r\nThen they chuckled together as they eyed the dessert. Dessert did not\r\ncount. It came rather late but that did not matter; they would nurse it\r\nall the same. When you\xe2\x80\x99re that stuffed, you can\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself be\r\nstopped by strawberries and cake. There was no hurry. They had the\r\nentire night if they wished. So they piled their plates with\r\nstrawberries and cream cheese. Meanwhile the men lit their pipes. They\r\nwere drinking the ordinary wine while they smoked since the special\r\nwine had been finished. Now they insisted that Gervaise cut the Savoy\r\ncake. Poisson got up and took the rose from the cake and presented it\r\nin his most gallant manner to the hostess amidst applause from the\r\nother guests. She pinned it over her left breast, near the heart. The\r\nsilver butterfly fluttered with her every movement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, look,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lorilleux, who had just made a discovery, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour work-table that we\xe2\x80\x99re eating off! Ah, well! I daresay it\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nseen so much work before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis malicious joke had a great success. Witty allusions came from all\r\nsides. Clemence could not swallow a spoonful of strawberries without\r\nsaying that it was another shirt ironed; Madame Lerat pretended that\r\nthe cream cheese smelt of starch; whilst Madame Lorilleux said between\r\nher teeth that it was capital fun to gobble up the money so quickly on\r\nthe very boards on which one had had so much trouble to earn it. There\r\nwas quite a tempest of shouts and laughter.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a loud voice called for silence. It was Boche who,\r\nstanding up in an affected and vulgar way, was commencing to sing \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nVolcano of Love, or the Seductive Trooper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thunder of applause greeted the first verse. Yes, yes, they would\r\nsing songs! Everyone in turn. It was more amusing than anything else.\r\nAnd they all put their elbows on the table or leant back in their\r\nchairs, nodding their heads at the best parts and sipping their wine\r\nwhen they came to the choruses. That rogue Boche had a special gift for\r\ncomic songs. He would almost make the water pitchers laugh when he\r\nimitated the raw recruit with his fingers apart and his hat on the back\r\nof his head. Directly after \xe2\x80\x9cThe Volcano of Love,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out into\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Baroness de Follebiche,\xe2\x80\x9d one of his greatest successes. When he\r\nreached the third verse he turned towards Clemence and almost murmured\r\nit in a slow and voluptuous tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe baroness had people there,\r\nHer sisters four, oh! rare surprise;\r\nAnd three were dark, and one was fair;\r\nBetween them, eight bewitching eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the whole party, carried away, joined in the chorus. The men beat\r\ntime with their heels, whilst the ladies did the same with their knives\r\nagainst their glasses. All of them singing at the top of their voices:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jingo! who on earth will pay\r\nA drink to the pa\xe2\x80\x94to the pa\xe2\x80\x94pa\xe2\x80\x94?\r\nBy Jingo! who on earth will pay\r\nA drink to the pa\xe2\x80\x94to the pa\xe2\x80\x94tro\xe2\x80\x94o\xe2\x80\x94l?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe panes of glass of the shop-front resounded, the singers\xe2\x80\x99 great\r\nvolume of breath agitated the muslin curtains. Whilst all this was\r\ngoing on, Virginie had already twice disappeared and each time, on\r\nreturning, had leant towards Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s ear to whisper a piece of\r\ninformation. When she returned the third time, in the midst of the\r\nuproar, she said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, he\xe2\x80\x99s still at Francois\xe2\x80\x99s; he\xe2\x80\x99s pretending to read the\r\nnewspaper. He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly meditating some evil design.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was speaking of Lantier. It was him that she had been watching. At\r\neach fresh report Gervaise became more and more grave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she of Virginie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the tall brunette. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks as though he had merely had\r\nwhat he required. It\xe2\x80\x99s that especially which makes me anxious. Why does\r\nhe remain there if he\xe2\x80\x99s had all he wanted? _Mon Dieu!_ I hope nothing\r\nis going to happen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe laundress, greatly upset, begged her to leave off. A profound\r\nsilence suddenly succeeded the clamor. Madame Putois had just risen and\r\nwas about to sing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Boarding of the Pirate.\xe2\x80\x9d The guests, silent and\r\nthoughtful, watched her; even Poisson had laid his pipe down on the\r\nedge of the table the better to listen to her. She stood up to the full\r\nheight of her little figure, with a fierce expression about her, though\r\nher face looked quite pale beneath her black cap; she thrust out her\r\nleft fist with a satisfied pride as she thundered in a voice bigger\r\nthan herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the pirate audacious\r\nShould o\xe2\x80\x99er the waves chase us,\r\nThe buccaneer slaughter,\r\nAccord him no quarter.\r\nTo the guns every man,\r\nAnd with rum fill each can!\r\nWhile these pests of the seas\r\nDangle from the cross-trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was something serious. By Jove! it gave one a fine idea of the\r\nreal thing. Poisson, who had been on board ship nodded his head in\r\napproval of the description. One could see too that that song was in\r\naccordance with Madame Putois\xe2\x80\x99s own feeling. Coupeau then told how\r\nMadame Putois, one evening on Rue Poulet, had slapped the face of four\r\nmen who sought to attack her virtue.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of mother Coupeau, Gervaise was now serving the\r\ncoffee, though some of the guests had not yet finished their Savoy\r\ncake. They would not let her sit down again, but shouted that it was\r\nher turn. With a pale face, and looking very ill at ease, she tried to\r\nexcuse herself; she seemed so queer that someone inquired whether the\r\ngoose had disagreed with her. She finally gave them \xe2\x80\x9cOh! let me\r\nslumber!\xe2\x80\x9d in a sweet and feeble voice. When she reached the chorus with\r\nits wish for a sleep filled with beautiful dreams, her eyelids partly\r\nclosed and her rapt gaze lost itself in the darkness of the street.\r\n\r\nPoisson stood next and with an abrupt bow to the ladies, sang a\r\ndrinking song: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wines of France.\xe2\x80\x9d But his voice wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very musical\r\nand only the final verse, a patriotic one mentioning the tricolor flag,\r\nwas a success. Then he raised his glass high, juggled it a moment, and\r\npoured the contents into his open mouth.\r\n\r\nThen came a string of ballads; Madame Boche\xe2\x80\x99s barcarolle was all about\r\nVenice and the gondoliers; Madame Lorilleux sang of Seville and the\r\nAndalusians in her bolero; whilst Lorilleux went so far as to allude to\r\nthe perfumes of Arabia, in reference to the loves of Fatima the dancer.\r\n\r\nGolden horizons were opening up all around the heavily laden table. The\r\nmen were smoking their pipes and the women unconsciously smiling with\r\npleasure. All were dreaming they were far away.\r\n\r\nClemence began to sing softly \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Make a Nest\xe2\x80\x9d with a tremolo in her\r\nvoice which pleased them greatly for it made them think of the open\r\ncountry, of songbirds, of dancing beneath an arbor, and of flowers. In\r\nshort, it made them think of the Bois de Vincennes when they went there\r\nfor a picnic.\r\n\r\nBut Virginie revived the joking with \xe2\x80\x9cMy Little Drop of Brandy.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nimitated a camp follower, with one hand on her hip, the elbow arched to\r\nindicate the little barrel; and with the other hand she poured out the\r\nbrandy into space by turning her fist round. She did it so well that\r\nthe party then begged mother Coupeau to sing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mouse.\xe2\x80\x9d The old woman\r\nrefused, vowing that she did not know that naughty song. Yet she\r\nstarted off with the remnants of her broken voice; and her wrinkled\r\nface with its lively little eyes underlined the allusions, the terrors\r\nof Mademoiselle Lise drawing her skirts around her at the sight of a\r\nmouse. All the table laughed; the women could not keep their\r\ncountenances, and continued casting bright glances at their neighbors;\r\nit was not indecent after all, there were no coarse words in it. All\r\nduring the song Boche was playing mouse up and down the legs of the\r\nlady coal-dealer. Things might have gotten a bit out of line if Goujet,\r\nin response to a glance from Gervaise, had not brought back the\r\nrespectful silence with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Farewell of Abdul-Kader,\xe2\x80\x9d which he sang\r\nout loudly in his bass voice. The song rang out from his golden beard\r\nas if from a brass trumpet. All the hearts skipped a beat when he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my noble comrade!\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s black mare.\r\nThey burst into applause even before the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pere Bru, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn!\xe2\x80\x9d said mother Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cSing your song.\r\nThe old ones are the best any day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd everybody turned towards the old man, pressing him and encouraging\r\nhim. He, in a state of torpor, with his immovable mask of tanned skin,\r\nlooked at them without appearing to understand. They asked him if he\r\nknew the \xe2\x80\x9cFive Vowels.\xe2\x80\x9d He held down his head; he could not recollect\r\nit; all the songs of the good old days were mixed up in his head. As\r\nthey made up their minds to leave him alone, he seemed to remember, and\r\nbegan to stutter in a cavernous voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrou la la, trou la la,\r\nTrou la, trou la, trou la la!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHis face assumed an animated expression, this chorus seemed to awake\r\nsome far-off gaieties within him, enjoyed by himself alone, as he\r\nlistened with a childish delight to his voice which became more and\r\nmore hollow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay there, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginie came and whispered in Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s ear,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just been there again, you know. It worried me. Well! Lantier has\r\ndisappeared from Francois\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet him outside?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the laundress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I walked quickly, not as if I was looking for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Virginie raised her eyes, interrupted herself and heaved a\r\nsmothered sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! _Mon Dieu!_ He\xe2\x80\x99s there, on the pavement opposite; he\xe2\x80\x99s looking\r\nthis way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, quite beside herself, ventured to glance in the direction\r\nindicated. Some persons had collected in the street to hear the party\r\nsing. And Lantier was indeed there in the front row, listening and\r\ncoolly looking on. It was rare cheek, everything considered. Gervaise\r\nfelt a chill ascend from her legs to her heart, and she no longer dared\r\nto move, whilst old Bru continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrou la la, trou la la,\r\nTrou la, trou la, trou la la!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Thank you, my ancient one, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the whole of it? You shall sing it for us another day when\r\nwe need something sad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis raised a few laughs. The old fellow stopped short, glanced round\r\nthe table with his pale eyes and resumed his look of a meditative\r\nanimal. Coupeau called for more wine as the coffee was finished.\r\nClemence was eating strawberries again. With the pause in singing, they\r\nbegan to talk about a woman who had been found hanging that morning in\r\nthe building next door. It was Madame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s turn, but she required to\r\nprepare herself. She dipped the corner of her napkin into a glass of\r\nwater and applied it to her temples because she was too hot. Then, she\r\nasked for a thimbleful of brandy, drank it, and slowly wiped her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Child of God,\xe2\x80\x99 shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98Child of God.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, tall and masculine-looking, with her bony nose and her shoulders\r\nas square as a grenadier\xe2\x80\x99s she began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lost child left by its mother alone\r\nIs sure of a home in Heaven above,\r\nGod sees and protects it on earth from His throne,\r\nThe child that is lost is the child of God\xe2\x80\x99s love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHer voice trembled at certain words, and dwelt on them in liquid notes;\r\nshe looked out of the corner of her eyes to heaven, whilst her right\r\nhand swung before her chest or pressed against her heart with an\r\nimpressive gesture. Then Gervaise, tortured by Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\ncould not restrain her tears; it seemed to her that the song was\r\nrelating her own suffering, that she was the lost child, abandoned by\r\nits mother, and whom God was going to take under his protection.\r\nClemence was now very drunk and she burst into loud sobbing and placed\r\nher head down onto the table in an effort to smother her gasps. There\r\nwas a hush vibrant with emotion.\r\n\r\nThe ladies had pulled out their handkerchiefs, and were drying their\r\neyes, with their heads erect from pride. The men had bowed their heads\r\nand were staring straight before them, blinking back their tears.\r\nPoisson bit off the end of his pipe twice while gulping and gasping.\r\nBoche, with two large tears trickling down his face, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nbothering to squeeze the coal-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s knee any longer. All these drunk\r\nrevelers were as soft-hearted as lambs. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the wine almost coming\r\nout of their eyes? When the refrain began again, they all let\r\nthemselves go, blubbering into their plates.\r\n\r\nBut Gervaise and Virginie could not, in spite of themselves, take their\r\neyes off the pavement opposite. Madame Boche, in her turn, caught sight\r\nof Lantier and uttered a faint cry without ceasing to besmear her face\r\nwith her tears. Then all three had very anxious faces as they exchanged\r\ninvoluntary signs. _Mon Dieu!_ if Coupeau were to turn round, if\r\nCoupeau caught sight of the other! What a butchery! What carnage! And\r\nthey went on to such an extent that the zinc-worker asked them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leant forward and recognized Lantier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamnation! It\xe2\x80\x99s too much,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered he. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! the dirty scoundrel\xe2\x80\x94ah!\r\nthe dirty scoundrel. No, it\xe2\x80\x99s too much, it must come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he rose from his seat muttering most atrocious threats,\r\nGervaise, in a low voice, implored him to keep quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, I implore you. Leave the knife alone. Remain where you\r\nare, don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginie had to take the knife which he had picked up off the table\r\nfrom him. But she could not prevent him leaving the shop and going up\r\nto Lantier.\r\n\r\nThose around the table saw nothing of this, so involved were they in\r\nweeping over the song as Madame Lerat sang the last verse. It sounded\r\nlike a moaning wail of the wind and Madame Putois was so moved that she\r\nspilled her wine over the table. Gervaise remained frozen with fright,\r\none hand tight against her lips to stifle her sobs. She expected at any\r\nmoment to see one of the two men fall unconscious in the street.\r\n\r\nAs Coupeau rushed toward Lantier, he was so astonished by the fresh air\r\nthat he staggered, and Lantier, with his hands in his pockets, merely\r\ntook a step to the side. Now the two men were almost shouting at each\r\nother, Coupeau calling the other a lousy pig and threatening to make\r\nsausage of his guts. They were shouting loudly and angrily and waving\r\ntheir arms violently. Gervaise felt faint and as it continued for a\r\nwhile, she closed her eyes. Suddenly, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear any shouting and\r\nopened her eyes. The two men were chatting amiably together.\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s voice rose higher and higher, warbling another verse.\r\n\r\nGervaise exchanged a glance with Madame Boche and Virginie. Was it\r\ngoing to end amicably then? Coupeau and Lantier continued to converse\r\non the edge of the pavement. They were still abusing each other, but in\r\na friendly way. As people were staring at them, they ended by strolling\r\nleisurely side by side past the houses, turning round again every ten\r\nyards or so. A very animated conversation was now taking place.\r\nSuddenly Coupeau appeared to become angry again, whilst the other was\r\nrefusing something and required to be pressed. And it was the\r\nzinc-worker who pushed Lantier along and who forced him to cross the\r\nstreet and enter the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite welcome!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass of\r\nwine. Men are men, you know. We ought to understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat was finishing the last chorus. The ladies were singing all\r\ntogether as they twisted their handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child that is lost is the child of God\xe2\x80\x99s love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe singer was greatly complimented and she resumed her seat affecting\r\nto be quite broken down. She asked for something to drink because she\r\nalways put too much feeling into that song and she was constantly\r\nafraid of straining her vocal chords. Everyone at the table now had\r\ntheir eyes fixed on Lantier who, quietly seated beside Coupeau, was\r\ndevouring the last piece of Savoy cake which he dipped in his glass of\r\nwine. With the exception of Virginie and Madame Boche none of the\r\nguests knew him. The Lorilleuxs certainly scented some underhand\r\nbusiness, but not knowing what, they merely assumed their most\r\nconceited air. Goujet, who had noticed Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s emotion, gave the\r\nnewcomer a sour look. As an awkward pause ensued Coupeau simply said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd turning to his wife, added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, stir yourself! Perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s still some hot coffee left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, feeling meek and stupid, looked at them one after the other.\r\nAt first, when her husband pushed her old lover into the shop, she\r\nburied her head between her hands, the same as she instinctively did on\r\nstormy days at each clap of thunder. She could not believe it possible;\r\nthe walls would fall in and crush them all. Then, when she saw the two\r\nsitting together peacefully, she suddenly accepted it as quite natural.\r\nA happy feeling of languor benumbed her, retained her all in a heap at\r\nthe edge of the table, with the sole desire of not being bothered. _Mon\r\nDieu!_ what is the use of putting oneself out when others do not, and\r\nwhen things arrange themselves to the satisfaction of everybody? She\r\ngot up to see if there was any coffee left.\r\n\r\nIn the back-room the children had fallen asleep. That squint-eyed\r\nAugustine had tyrannized over them all during the dessert, pilfering\r\ntheir strawberries and frightening them with the most abominable\r\nthreats. Now she felt very ill, and was bent double upon a stool, not\r\nuttering a word, her face ghastly pale. Fat Pauline had let her head\r\nfall against Etienne\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and he himself was sleeping on the\r\nedge of the table. Nana was seated with Victor on the rug beside the\r\nbedstead, she had passed her arm round his neck and was drawing him\r\ntowards her; and, succumbing to drowsiness and with her eyes shut, she\r\nkept repeating in a feeble voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mamma, I\xe2\x80\x99m not well; oh! mamma, I\xe2\x80\x99m not well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Augustine, whose head was rolling about on her\r\nshoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re drunk; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been singing like grown up persons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise received another blow on beholding Etienne. She felt as though\r\nshe would choke when she thought of the youngster\xe2\x80\x99s father being there\r\nin the other room, eating cake, and that he had not even expressed a\r\ndesire to kiss the little fellow. She was on the point of rousing\r\nEtienne and of carrying him there in her arms. Then she again felt that\r\nthe quiet way in which matters had been arranged was the best. It would\r\nnot have been proper to have disturbed the harmony of the end of the\r\ndinner. She returned with the coffee-pot and poured out a glass of\r\ncoffee for Lantier, who, by the way, did not appear to take any notice\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s my turn,\xe2\x80\x9d stuttered Coupeau, in a thick voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nkeeping the best for the last. Well! I\xe2\x80\x99ll sing you \xe2\x80\x98That Piggish\r\nChild.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, \xe2\x80\x98That Piggish Child,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d cried everyone.\r\n\r\nThe uproar was beginning again. Lantier was forgotten. The ladies\r\nprepared their glasses and their knives for accompanying the chorus.\r\nThey laughed beforehand, as they looked at the zinc-worker, who\r\nsteadied himself on his legs as he put on his most vulgar air.\r\nMimicking the hoarse voice of an old woman, he sang:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen out of bed each morn I hop,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m always precious queer;\r\nI send him for a little drop\r\nTo the drinking-den that\xe2\x80\x99s near.\r\nA good half hour or more he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay,\r\nAnd that makes me so riled,\r\nHe swigs it half upon his way:\r\nWhat a piggish child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the ladies, striking their glasses, repeated in chorus in the midst\r\nof a formidable gaiety:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a piggish child!\r\nWhat a piggish child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or itself joined in now. The whole\r\nneighborhood was singing \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a piggish child!\xe2\x80\x9d The little clockmaker,\r\nthe grocery clerks, the tripe woman and the fruit woman all knew the\r\nsong and joined in the chorus. The entire street seemed to be getting\r\ndrunk on the odors from the Coupeau party. In the reddish haze from the\r\ntwo lamps, the noise of the party was enough to shut out the rumbling\r\nof the last vehicles in the street. Two policemen rushed over, thinking\r\nthere was a riot, but on recognizing Poisson, they saluted him smartly\r\nand went away between the darkened buildings.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was now singing this verse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Sundays at Petite Villette,\r\nWhene\xe2\x80\x99er the weather\xe2\x80\x99s fine,\r\nWe call on uncle, old Tinette,\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s in the dustman line.\r\nTo feast upon some cherry stones\r\nThe young un\xe2\x80\x99s almost wild,\r\nAnd rolls amongst the dust and bones,\r\nWhat a piggish child!\r\nWhat a piggish child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the house almost collapsed, such a yell ascended in the calm warm\r\nnight air that the shouters applauded themselves, for it was useless\r\ntheir hoping to be able to bawl any louder.\r\n\r\nNot one of the party could ever recollect exactly how the carouse\r\nterminated. It must have been very late, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite certain, for not a\r\ncat was to be seen in the street. Possibly too, they had all joined\r\nhands and danced round the table. But all was submerged in a yellow\r\nmist, in which red faces were jumping about, with mouths slit from ear\r\nto ear. They had probably treated themselves to something stronger than\r\nwine towards the end, and there was a vague suspicion that some one had\r\nplayed them the trick of putting salt into the glasses. The children\r\nmust have undressed and put themselves to bed. On the morrow, Madame\r\nBoche boasted of having treated Boche to a couple of clouts in a\r\ncorner, where he was conversing a great deal too close to the\r\ncharcoal-dealer; but Boche, who recollected nothing, said she must have\r\ndreamt it. Everyone agreed that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very decent the way Clemence\r\nhad carried on. She had ended by showing everything she had and then\r\nbeen so sick that she had completely ruined one of the muslin curtains.\r\nThe men had at least the decency to go into the street; Lorilleux and\r\nPoisson, feeling their stomachs upset, had stumblingly glided as far as\r\nthe pork-butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop. It is easy to see when a person has been well\r\nbrought up. For instance, the ladies, Madame Putois, Madame Lerat, and\r\nVirginie, indisposed by the heat, had simply gone into the back-room\r\nand taken their stays off; Virginie had even desired to lie on the bed\r\nfor a minute, just to obviate any unpleasant effects. Thus the party\r\nhad seemed to melt away, some disappearing behind the others, all\r\naccompanying one another, and being lost sight of in the surrounding\r\ndarkness, to the accompaniment of a final uproar, a furious quarrel\r\nbetween the Lorilleuxs, and an obstinate and mournful \xe2\x80\x9ctrou la la, trou\r\nla la,\xe2\x80\x9d of old Bru\xe2\x80\x99s. Gervaise had an idea that Goujet had burst out\r\nsobbing when bidding her good-bye; Coupeau was still singing; and as\r\nfor Lantier, he must have remained till the end. At one moment even,\r\nshe could still feel a breath against her hair, but she was unable to\r\nsay whether it came from Lantier or if it was the warm night air.\r\n\r\nSince Madame Lerat didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to return to Les Batignolles at such a\r\nlate hour, they took one of the mattresses off the bed and spread it\r\nfor her in a corner of the shop, after pushing back the table. She\r\nslept right there amid all the dinner crumbs. All night long, while the\r\nCoupeaus were sleeping, a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s cat took advantage of an open\r\nwindow and was crunching the bones of the goose with its sharp teeth,\r\ngiving the bird its final resting place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday Coupeau, who had not come home to dinner,\r\nbrought Lantier with him towards ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. They had had some sheep\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrotters at Chez Thomas at Montmartre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t scold, wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said the zinc-worker. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re sober, as you\r\ncan see. Oh! there\xe2\x80\x99s no fear with him; he keeps one on the straight\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he related how they happened to meet in the Rue Rochechouart. After\r\ndinner Lantier had declined to have a drink at the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Ball,\xe2\x80\x9d saying\r\nthat when one was married to a pretty and worthy little woman, one\r\nought not to go liquoring-up at all the wineshops. Gervaise smiled\r\nslightly as she listened. Oh! she was not thinking of scolding, she\r\nfelt too much embarrassed for that. She had been expecting to see her\r\nformer lover again some day ever since their dinner party; but at such\r\nan hour, when she was about to go to bed, the unexpected arrival of the\r\ntwo men had startled her. Her hands were quivering as she pinned back\r\nthe hair which had slid down her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9cas he was so polite as to decline a drink\r\noutside, you must treat us to one here. Ah! you certainly owe us that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workwomen had left long ago. Mother Coupeau and Nana had just gone\r\nto bed. Gervaise, who had been just about to put up the shutters when\r\nthey appeared, left the shop open and brought some glasses which she\r\nplaced on a corner of the work-table with what was left of a bottle of\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\nLantier remained standing and avoided speaking directly to her.\r\nHowever, when she served him, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a thimbleful, madame, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau looked at them and then spoke his mind very plainly. They were\r\nnot going to behave like a couple of geese he hoped! The past was past\r\nwas it not? If people nursed grudges for nine and ten years together\r\none would end by no longer seeing anybody. No, no, he carried his heart\r\nin his hand, he did! First of all, he knew who he had to deal with, a\r\nworthy woman and a worthy man\xe2\x80\x94in short two friends! He felt easy; he\r\nknew he could depend upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that\xe2\x80\x99s certain, quite certain,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gervaise, looking on the\r\nground and scarcely understanding what she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a sister now\xe2\x80\x94nothing but a sister!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Lantier in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ shake hands,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9cand let those who don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nit go to blazes! When one has proper feelings one is better off than\r\nmillionaires. For myself I prefer friendship before everything because\r\nfriendship is friendship and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to beat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dealt himself heavy blows on the chest, and seemed so moved that\r\nthey had to calm him. They all three silently clinked glasses, and\r\ndrank their drop of brandy. Gervaise was then able to look at Lantier\r\nat her ease; for on the night of her saint\xe2\x80\x99s day, she had only seen him\r\nthrough a fog. He had grown more stout, his arms and legs seeming too\r\nheavy because of his small stature. His face was still handsome even\r\nthough it was a little puffy now due to his life of idleness. He still\r\ntook great pains with his narrow moustache. He looked about his actual\r\nage. He was wearing grey trousers, a heavy blue overcoat, and a round\r\nhat. He even had a watch with a silver chain on which a ring was\r\nhanging as a keepsake. He looked quite like a gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI live no end of a distance from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was already on the pavement when the zinc-worker called him back to\r\nmake him promise never to pass the door without looking in to wish them\r\ngood day. Meanwhile Gervaise, who had quietly disappeared, returned\r\npushing Etienne before her. The child, who was in his shirt-sleeves and\r\nhalf asleep, smiled as he rubbed his eyes. But when he beheld Lantier\r\nhe stood trembling and embarrassed, and casting anxious glances in the\r\ndirection of his mother and Coupeau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember this gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the latter.\r\n\r\nThe child held down his head without replying. Then he made a slight\r\nsign which meant that he did remember the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Then, don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there like a fool; go and kiss him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier gravely and quietly waited. When Etienne had made up his mind\r\nto approach him, he stooped down, presented both his cheeks, and then\r\nkissed the youngster on the forehead himself. At this the boy ventured\r\nto look at his father; but all on a sudden he burst out sobbing and\r\nscampered away like a mad creature with his clothes half falling off\r\nhim, whilst Coupeau angrily called him a young savage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe emotion\xe2\x80\x99s too much for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, pale and agitated\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he\xe2\x80\x99s generally very gentle and nice,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought him up properly, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see. He\xe2\x80\x99ll get used to you. He must\r\nlearn to know people. We can\xe2\x80\x99t stay mad. We should have made up a long\r\ntime ago for his sake. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have my head cut off than keep a\r\nfather from seeing his own son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thus delivered himself, he talked of finishing the bottle of\r\nbrandy. All three clinked glasses again. Lantier showed no surprise,\r\nbut remained perfectly calm. By way of repaying the zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoliteness he persisted in helping him put up the shutters before\r\ntaking his departure. Then rubbing his hands together to get rid of the\r\ndust on them, he wished the couple good-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep well. I shall try and catch the last bus. I promise you I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlook in again soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that evening Lantier frequently called at the Rue de la\r\nGoutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. He came when the zinc-worker was there, inquiring after\r\nhis health the moment he passed the door and affecting to have solely\r\ncalled on his account. Then clean-shaven, his hair nicely combed and\r\nalways wearing his overcoat, he would take a seat by the window and\r\nconverse politely with the manners of an educated man. It was thus that\r\nthe Coupeaus learnt little by little the details of his life. During\r\nthe last eight years he had for a while managed a hat factory; and when\r\nthey asked him why he had retired from it he merely alluded to the\r\nrascality of a partner, a fellow from his native place, a scoundrel who\r\nhad squandered all the takings with women. His former position as an\r\nemployer continued to affect his entire personality, like a title of\r\nnobility that he could not abandon. He was always talking of concluding\r\na magnificent deal with some hatmakers who were going to set him up in\r\nbusiness. While waiting for this he did nothing but stroll around all\r\nday like one of the idle rich. If anyone dared to mention a hat factory\r\nlooking for workers, he smiled and said he was not interested in\r\nbreaking his back working for others.\r\n\r\nA smart fellow like Lantier, according to Coupeau, knew how to take\r\ncare of himself. He always looked prosperous and it took money to look\r\nthus. He must have some deal going. One morning Coupeau had seen him\r\nhaving his shoes shined on the Boulevard Montmartre. Lantier was very\r\ntalkative about others, but the truth was that he told lies about\r\nhimself. He would not even say where he lived, only that he was staying\r\nwith a friend and there was no use in coming to see him because he was\r\nnever in.\r\n\r\nIt was now early November. Lantier would gallantly bring bunches of\r\nviolets for Gervaise and the workwomen. He was now coming almost every\r\nday. He won the favor of Clemence and Madame Putois with his little\r\nattentions. At the end of the month they adored him. The Boches, whom\r\nhe flattered by going to pay his respects in their concierge\xe2\x80\x99s lodge,\r\nwent into ecstasies over his politeness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Lorilleuxs knew who he was, they howled at the impudence\r\nof Gervaise in bringing her former lover into her home. However, one\r\nday Lantier went to visit them and made such a good impression when he\r\nordered a necklace for a lady of his acquaintance that they invited him\r\nto sit down. He stayed an hour and they were so charmed by his\r\nconversation that they wondered how a man of such distinction had ever\r\nlived with Clump-clump. Soon Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s visits to the Coupeaus were\r\naccepted as perfectly natural; he was in the good graces of everyone\r\nalong the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. Goujet was the only one who remained\r\ncold. If he happened to be there when Lantier arrived, he would leave\r\nat once as he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be obliged to be friendly to him.\r\n\r\nIn the midst, however, of all this extraordinary affection for Lantier,\r\nGervaise lived in a state of great agitation for the first few weeks.\r\nShe felt that burning sensation in the pit of her stomach which\r\naffected her on the day when Virginie first alluded to her past life.\r\nHer great fear was that she might find herself without strength, if he\r\ncame upon her all alone one night and took it into his head to kiss\r\nher. She thought of him too much; she was for ever thinking of him. But\r\nshe gradually became calmer on seeing him behave so well, never looking\r\nher in the face, never even touching her with the tips of his fingers\r\nwhen no one was watching. Then Virginie, who seemed to read within her,\r\nmade her ashamed of all her wicked thoughts. Why did she tremble? Once\r\ncould not hope to come across a nicer man. She certainly had nothing to\r\nfear now. And one day the tall brunette maneuvered in such a way as to\r\nget them both into a corner, and to turn the conversation to the\r\nsubject of love. Lantier, choosing his words, declared in a grave voice\r\nthat his heart was dead, that for the future he wished to consecrate\r\nhis life solely for his son\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. Every evening he would kiss\r\nEtienne on the forehead, yet he was apt to forget him in teasing back\r\nand forth with Clemence. And he never mentioned Claude who was still in\r\nthe south. Gervaise began to feel at ease. Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s actual presence\r\novershadowed her memories, and seeing him all the time, she no longer\r\ndreamed about him. She even felt a certain repugnance at the thought of\r\ntheir former relationship. Yes, it was over. If he dared to approach\r\nher, she\xe2\x80\x99d box his ears, or even better, she\xe2\x80\x99d tell her husband. Once\r\nagain her thoughts turned to Goujet and his affection for her.\r\n\r\nOne morning Clemence reported that the previous night, at about eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, she had seen Monsieur Lantier with a woman. She told about it\r\nmaliciously and in coarse terms to see how Gervaise would react. Yes,\r\nMonsieur Lantier was on the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette with a blonde and\r\nshe followed them. They had gone into a shop where the worn-out and\r\nused-up woman had bought some shrimps. Then they went to the Rue de La\r\nRochefoucauld. Monsieur Lantier had waited on the pavement in front of\r\nthe house while his lady friend went in alone. Then she had beckoned to\r\nhim from the window to join her.\r\n\r\nNo matter how Clemence went on with the story Gervaise went on\r\npeacefully ironing a white dress. Sometimes she smiled faintly. These\r\nsoutherners, she said, are all crazy about women; they have to have\r\nthem no matter what, even if they come from a dung heap. When Lantier\r\ncame in that evening, Gervaise was amused when Clemence teased him\r\nabout the blonde. He seemed to feel flattered that he had been seen.\r\n_Mon Dieu!_ she was just an old friend, he explained. He saw her from\r\ntime to time. She was quite stylish. He mentioned some of her former\r\nlovers, among them a count, an important merchant and the son of a\r\nlawyer. He added that a bit of playing around didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a thing, his\r\nheart was dead. In the end Clemence had to pay a price for her\r\nmeanness. She certainly felt Lantier pinching her hard two or three\r\ntimes without seeming to do so. She was also jealous because she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreek of musk like that boulevard work-horse.\r\n\r\nWhen spring came, Lantier, who was now quite one of the family, talked\r\nof living in the neighborhood, so as to be nearer his friends. He\r\nwanted a furnished room in a decent house. Madame Boche, and even\r\nGervaise herself went searching about to find it for him. They explored\r\nthe neighboring streets. But he was always too difficult to please; he\r\nrequired a big courtyard, a room on the ground floor; in fact, every\r\nluxury imaginable. And then every evening, at the Coupeaus\xe2\x80\x99, he seemed\r\nto measure the height of the ceilings, study the arrangement of the\r\nrooms, and covet a similar lodging. Oh, he would never have asked for\r\nanything better, he would willingly have made himself a hole in that\r\nwarm, quiet corner. Then each time he wound up his inspection with\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! you are comfortably situated here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne evening, when he had dined there, and was making the same remark\r\nduring the dessert, Coupeau, who now treated him most familiarly,\r\nsuddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must stay here, old boy, if it suits you. It\xe2\x80\x99s easily arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he explained that the dirty-clothes room, cleaned out, would make a\r\nnice apartment. Etienne could sleep in the shop, on a mattress on the\r\nfloor, that was all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot accept. It would inconvenience you\r\ntoo much. I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s willingly offered, but we should be too warm\r\nall jumbled up together. Besides, you know, each one likes his liberty.\r\nI should have to go through your room, and that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be exactly\r\nfunny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the rogue!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the zinc-worker, choking with laughter,\r\nbanging his fist down on the table, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s always thinking of something\r\nsmutty! But, you joker, we\xe2\x80\x99re of an inventive turn of mind! There\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntwo windows in the room, aren\xe2\x80\x99t there? Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll knock one out and\r\nturn it into a door. Then, you understand you come in by way of the\r\ncourtyard, and we can even stop up the other door, if we like. Thus\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be in your home, and we in ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pause ensued. At length the hatter murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, in that manner perhaps we might. And yet no, I should be too\r\nmuch in your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe avoided looking at Gervaise. But he was evidently waiting for a word\r\nfrom her before accepting. She was very much annoyed at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nidea; not that the thought of seeing Lantier living with them wounded\r\nher feelings, or made her particularly uneasy, but she was wondering\r\nwhere she would be able to keep the dirty clothes. Coupeau was going on\r\nabout the advantages of the arrangement. Their rent, five hundred\r\nfrancs, had always been a bit steep. Their friend could pay twenty\r\nfrancs a month for a nicely furnished room and it would help them with\r\nthe rent. He would be responsible for fixing up a big box under their\r\nbed that would be large enough to hold all the dirty clothes. Gervaise\r\nstill hesitated. She looked toward mother Coupeau for guidance. Lantier\r\nhad won over mother Coupeau months ago by bringing her gum drops for\r\nher cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would certainly not be in our way,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise ended by saying. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\ncould so arrange things\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the hatter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too kind; it would be\r\nasking too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau could no longer restrain himself. Was he going to continue\r\nmaking objections when they told him it was freely offered? He would be\r\nobliging them. There, did he understand? Then in an excited tone of\r\nvoice he yelled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEtienne! Etienne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe youngster had fallen asleep on the table. He raised his head with a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, tell him that you wish it. Yes, that gentleman there. Tell him\r\nas loud as you can: \xe2\x80\x98I wish it!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it!\xe2\x80\x9d stuttered Etienne, his voice thick with sleep.\r\n\r\nEveryone laughed. But Lantier resumed his grave and impressive air. He\r\nsqueezed Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s hand across the table as he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept. It\xe2\x80\x99s in all good fellowship on both sides, is it not? Yes, I\r\naccept for the child\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day when the landlord, Monsieur Marescot, came to spend an\r\nhour with the Boches, Gervaise mentioned the matter to him. He refused\r\nangrily at first. Then, after a careful inspection of the premises,\r\nparticularly gazing upward to verify that the upper floors would not be\r\nweakened, he finally granted permission on condition there would be no\r\nexpense to him. He had the Coupeaus sign a paper saying they would\r\nrestore everything to its original state on the expiration of the\r\nlease.\r\n\r\nCoupeau brought in some friends of his that very evening\xe2\x80\x94a mason, a\r\ncarpenter and a painter. They would do this job in the evenings as a\r\nfavor to him. Still, installing the door and cleaning up the room cost\r\nover one hundred francs, not counting the wine that kept the work\r\ngoing. Coupeau told his friends he\xe2\x80\x99d pay them something later, out of\r\nthe rent from his tenant.\r\n\r\nThen the furniture for the room had to be sorted out. Gervaise left\r\nmother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe where it was, and added a table and two\r\nchairs taken from her own room. She had to buy a washing-stand and a\r\nbed with mattress and bedclothes, costing one hundred and thirty\r\nfrancs, which she was to pay off at ten francs a month. Although\r\nLantier\xe2\x80\x99s twenty francs would be used to pay off these debts for ten\r\nmonths, there would be a nice little profit later.\r\n\r\nIt was during the early days of June that the hatter moved in. The day\r\nbefore, Coupeau had offered to go with him and fetch his box, to save\r\nhim the thirty sous for a cab. But the other became quite embarrassed,\r\nsaying that the box was too heavy, as though he wished up to the last\r\nmoment to hide the place where he lodged. He arrived in the afternoon\r\ntowards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Coupeau did not happen to be in. And Gervaise,\r\nstanding at the shop door became quite pale on recognizing the box\r\noutside the cab. It was their old box, the one with which they had\r\njourneyed from Plassans, all scratched and broken now and held together\r\nby cords. She saw it return as she had often dreamt it would and it\r\nneeded no great stretch of imagination to believe that the same cab,\r\nthat cab in which that strumpet of a burnisher had played her such a\r\nfoul trick, had brought the box back again. Meanwhile Boche was giving\r\nLantier a helping hand. The laundress followed them in silence and\r\nfeeling rather dazed. When they had deposited their burden in the\r\nmiddle of the room she said for the sake of saying something:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing finished, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen pulling herself together, seeing that Lantier, busy in undoing the\r\ncords was not even looking at her, she added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Boche, you must have a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she went and fetched a quart of wine and some glasses.\r\n\r\nJust then Poisson passed along the pavement in uniform. She signaled to\r\nhim, winking her eye and smiling. The policeman understood perfectly.\r\nWhen he was on duty and anyone winked their eye to him it meant a glass\r\nof wine. He would even walk for hours up and down before the laundry\r\nwaiting for a wink. Then so as not to be seen, he would pass through\r\nthe courtyard and toss off the liquor in secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier when he saw him enter, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s you, Badingue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called him Badingue for a joke, just to show how little he cared for\r\nthe Emperor. Poisson put up with it in his stiff way without one\r\nknowing whether it really annoyed him or not. Besides the two men,\r\nthough separated by their political convictions, had become very good\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know that the Emperor was once a policeman in London,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boche\r\nin his turn. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, on my word! He used to take the drunken women to the\r\nstation-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had filled three glasses on the table. She would not drink\r\nherself, she felt too sick at heart, but she stood there longing to see\r\nwhat the box contained and watching Lantier remove the last cords.\r\nBefore raising the lid Lantier took his glass and clinked it with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSame to you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Boche and Poisson.\r\n\r\nThe laundress filled the glasses again. The three men wiped their lips\r\non the backs of their hands. And at last the hatter opened the box. It\r\nwas full of a jumble of newspapers, books, old clothes and underlinen,\r\nin bundles. He took out successively a saucepan, a pair of boots, a\r\nbust of Ledru-Rollin with the nose broken, an embroidered shirt and a\r\npair of working trousers. Gervaise could smell the odor of tobacco and\r\nthat of a man whose linen wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too clean, one who took care only of\r\nthe outside, of what people could see.\r\n\r\nThe old hat was no longer in the left corner. There was a pincushion\r\nshe did not recognize, doubtless a present from some woman. She became\r\ncalmer, but felt a vague sadness as she continued to watch the objects\r\nthat appeared, wondering if they were from her time or from the time of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Badingue, do you know this?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Lantier.\r\n\r\nHe thrust under his nose a little book printed at Brussels. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Amours\r\nof Napoleon III.,\xe2\x80\x9d Illustrated with engravings. It related, among other\r\nanecdotes, how the Emperor had seduced a girl of thirteen, the daughter\r\nof a cook; and the picture represented Napoleon III., bare-legged, and\r\nalso wearing the grand ribbon of the Legion of Honor, pursuing a little\r\ngirl who was trying to escape his lust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s it exactly!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Boche, whose slyly ridiculous\r\ninstincts felt flattered by the sight. \xe2\x80\x9cIt always happens like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoisson was seized with consternation, and he could not find a word to\r\nsay in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s defense. It was in a book, so he could not deny\r\nit. Then, Lantier, continuing to push the picture under his nose in a\r\njeering way, he extended his arms and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier didn\xe2\x80\x99t reply. He busied himself arranging his books and\r\nnewspapers on a shelf in the wardrobe. He seemed upset not to have a\r\nsmall bookshelf over his table, so Gervaise promised to get him one. He\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9cThe History of Ten Years\xe2\x80\x9d by Louis Blanc (except for the first\r\nvolume), Lamartine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Girondins\xe2\x80\x9d in installments, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mysteries of\r\nParis\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wandering Jew\xe2\x80\x9d by Eugene Sue, and a quantity of\r\nbooklets on philosophic and humanitarian subjects picked up from used\r\nbook dealers.\r\n\r\nHis newspapers were his prized possessions, a collection made over a\r\nnumber of years. Whenever he read an article in a cafe that seemed to\r\nhim to agree with his own ideas, he would buy that newspaper and keep\r\nit. He had an enormous bundle of them, papers of every date and every\r\ntitle, piled up in no discernable order. He patted them and said to the\r\nother two:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see that? No one else can boast of having anything to match it.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine all that\xe2\x80\x99s in there. I mean, if they put into\r\npractice only half the ideas, it would clean up the social order\r\novernight. That would be good medicine for your Emperor and all his\r\nstool pigeons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman\xe2\x80\x99s red mustache and beard began to bristle on his pale\r\nface and he interrupted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the army, tell me, what are you going to do about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier flew into a passion. He banged his fists down on the newspapers\r\nas he yelled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI require the suppression of militarism, the fraternity of peoples. I\r\nrequire the abolition of privileges, of titles, and of monopolies. I\r\nrequire the equality of salaries, the division of benefits, the\r\nglorification of the protectorate. All liberties, do you hear? All of\r\nthem! And divorce!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, divorce for morality!\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Boche.\r\n\r\nPoisson had assumed a majestic air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet if I won\xe2\x80\x99t have your liberties, I\xe2\x80\x99m free to refuse them,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nLantier was choking with passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want them\xe2\x80\x94if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not free at all! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want them, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you off to\r\nDevil\xe2\x80\x99s Island. Yes, Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Island with your Emperor and all the rats\r\nof his crew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey always quarreled thus every time they met. Gervaise, who did not\r\nlike arguments, usually interfered. She roused herself from the torpor\r\ninto which the sight of the box, full of the stale perfume of her past\r\nlove, had plunged her, and she drew the three men\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier, becoming suddenly calm and taking his glass.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood health!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood health!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Boche and Poisson, clinking glasses with him.\r\n\r\nBoche, however, was moving nervously about, troubled by an anxiety as\r\nhe looked at the policeman out of the corner of his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this between ourselves, eh, Monsieur Poisson?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he at\r\nlength. \xe2\x80\x9cWe say and show you things to show off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Poisson did not let him finish. He placed his hand upon his heart,\r\nas though to explain that all remained buried there. He certainly did\r\nnot go spying about on his friends. Coupeau arriving, they emptied a\r\nsecond quart. Then the policeman went off by way of the courtyard and\r\nresumed his stiff and measured tread along the pavement.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the new arrangement, the entire routine of the\r\nestablishment was considerably upset. Lantier had his own separate\r\nroom, with his own entrance and his own key. However, since they had\r\ndecided not to close off the door between the rooms, he usually came\r\nand went through the shop. Besides, the dirty clothes were an\r\ninconvenience to Gervaise because her husband never made the case he\r\nhad promised and she had to tuck the dirty laundry into any odd corner\r\nshe could find. They usually ended up under the bed and this was not\r\nvery pleasant on warm summer nights. She also found it a nuisance\r\nhaving to make up Etienne\xe2\x80\x99s bed every evening in the shop. When her\r\nemployees worked late, the lad had to sleep in a chair until they\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nGoujet had mentioned sending Etienne to Lille where a machinist he knew\r\nwas looking for apprentices. As the boy was unhappy at home and eager\r\nto be out on his own, Gervaise seriously considered the proposal. Her\r\nonly fear was that Lantier would refuse. Since he had come to live with\r\nthem solely to be near his son, surely he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose him\r\nonly two weeks after he moved in. However he approved whole-heartedly\r\nwhen she timidly broached the matter to him. He said that young men\r\nneeded to see a bit of the country. The morning that Etienne left\r\nLantier made a speech to him, kissed him and ended by saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever forget that a workingman is not a slave, and that whoever is not\r\na workingman is a lazy drone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe household was now able to get into the new routine. Gervaise became\r\naccustomed to having dirty laundry lying all around. Lantier was\r\nforever talking of important business deals. Sometimes he went out,\r\nwearing fresh linen and neatly combed. He would stay out all night and\r\non his return pretend that he was completely exhausted because he had\r\nbeen discussing very serious matters. Actually he was merely taking\r\nlife easy. He usually slept until ten. In the afternoons he would take\r\na walk if the weather was nice. If it was raining, he would sit in the\r\nshop reading his newspaper. This atmosphere suited him. He always felt\r\nat his ease with women and enjoyed listening to them.\r\n\r\nLantier first took his meals at Francois\xe2\x80\x99s, at the corner of the Rue\r\ndes Poissonniers. But of the seven days in the week he dined with the\r\nCoupeaus on three or four; so much so that he ended by offering to\r\nboard with them and to pay them fifteen francs every Saturday. From\r\nthat time he scarcely ever left the house, but made himself completely\r\nat home there. Morning to night he was in the shop, even giving orders\r\nand attending to customers.\r\n\r\nLantier didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the wine from Francois\xe2\x80\x99s, so he persuaded Gervaise\r\nto buy her wine from Vigouroux, the coal-dealer. Then he decided that\r\nCoudeloup\xe2\x80\x99s bread was not baked to his satisfaction, so he sent\r\nAugustine to the Viennese bakery in the Faubourg Poissonniers for their\r\nbread. He changed from the grocer Lehongre but kept the butcher, fat\r\nCharles, because of his political opinions. After a month he wanted all\r\nthe cooking done with olive oil. Clemence joked that with a Provencal\r\nlike him you could never wash out the oil stains. He wanted his omelets\r\nfried on both sides, as hard as pancakes. He supervised mother\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s cooking, wanting his steaks cooked like shoe leather and with\r\ngarlic on everything. He got angry if she put herbs in the salad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re just weeds and some of them might be poisonous,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\nHis favorite soup was made with over-boiled vermicelli. He would pour\r\nin half a bottle of olive oil. Only he and Gervaise could eat this\r\nsoup, the others being too used to Parisian cooking.\r\n\r\nLittle by little Lantier also came to mixing himself up in the affairs\r\nof the family. As the Lorilleuxs always grumbled at having to part with\r\nthe five francs for mother Coupeau, he explained that an action could\r\nbe brought against them. They must think that they had a set of fools\r\nto deal with! It was ten francs a month which they ought to give! And\r\nhe would go up himself for the ten francs so boldly and yet so amiably\r\nthat the chainmaker never dared refuse them. Madame Lerat also gave two\r\nfive-franc pieces now. Mother Coupeau could have kissed Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. He was, moreover, the grand arbiter in all the quarrels between\r\nthe old woman and Gervaise. Whenever the laundress, in a moment of\r\nimpatience, behaved roughly to her mother-in-law and the latter went\r\nand cried on her bed, he hustled them about and made them kiss each\r\nother, asking them if they thought themselves amusing with their bad\r\ntempers.\r\n\r\nAnd Nana, too; she was being brought up badly, according to his idea.\r\nIn that he was right, for whenever the father spanked the child, the\r\nmother took her part, and if the mother, in her turn, boxed her ears,\r\nthe father made a disturbance. Nana delighted at seeing her parents\r\nabuse each other, and knowing that she was forgiven beforehand, was up\r\nto all kinds of tricks. Her latest mania was to go and play in the\r\nblacksmith shop opposite; she would pass the entire day swinging on the\r\nshafts of the carts; she would hide with bands of urchins in the\r\nremotest corners of the gray courtyard, lighted up with the red glare\r\nof the forge; and suddenly she would reappear, running and shouting,\r\nunkempt and dirty and followed by the troop of urchins, as though a\r\nsudden clash of the hammers had frightened the ragamuffins away.\r\nLantier alone could scold her; and yet she knew perfectly well how to\r\nget over him. This tricky little girl of ten would walk before him like\r\na lady, swinging herself about and casting side glances at him, her\r\neyes already full of vice. He had ended by undertaking her education:\r\nhe taught her to dance and to talk patois.\r\n\r\nA year passed thus. In the neighborhood it was thought that Lantier had\r\na private income, for this was the only way to account for the\r\nCoupeaus\xe2\x80\x99 grand style of living. No doubt Gervaise continued to earn\r\nmoney; but now that she had to support two men in doing nothing, the\r\nshop certainly could not suffice; more especially as the shop no longer\r\nhad so good a reputation, customers were leaving and the workwomen were\r\ntippling from morning till night. The truth was that Lantier paid\r\nnothing, neither for rent nor board. During the first months he had\r\npaid sums on account, then he had contented himself with speaking of a\r\nlarge amount he was going to receive, with which later on he would pay\r\noff everything in a lump sum. Gervaise no longer dared ask him for a\r\ncentime. She had the bread, the wine, the meat, all on credit. The\r\nbills increased everywhere at the rate of three and four francs a day.\r\nShe had not paid a sou to the furniture dealer nor to the three\r\ncomrades, the mason, the carpenter and the painter. All these people\r\ncommenced to grumble, and she was no longer greeted with the same\r\npoliteness at the shops.\r\n\r\nShe was as though intoxicated by a mania for getting into debt; she\r\ntried to drown her thoughts, ordered the most expensive things, and\r\ngave full freedom to her gluttony now that she no longer paid for\r\nanything; she remained withal very honest at heart, dreaming of earning\r\nfrom morning to night hundreds of francs, though she did not exactly\r\nknow how, to enable her to distribute handfuls of five-franc pieces to\r\nher tradespeople. In short, she was sinking, and as she sank lower and\r\nlower she talked of extending her business. Instead she went deeper\r\ninto debt. Clemence left around the middle of the summer because there\r\nwas no longer enough work for two women and she had not been paid in\r\nseveral weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring this impending ruin, Coupeau and Lantier were, in effect,\r\ndevouring the shop and growing fat on the ruin of the establishment. At\r\ntable they would challenge each other to take more helpings and slap\r\ntheir rounded stomachs to make more room for dessert.\r\n\r\nThe great subject of conversation in the neighborhood was as to whether\r\nLantier had really gone back to his old footing with Gervaise. On this\r\npoint opinions were divided. According to the Lorilleuxs, Clump-clump\r\nwas doing everything she could to hook Lantier again, but he would no\r\nlonger have anything to do with her because she was getting old and\r\nfaded and he had plenty of younger girls that were prettier. On the\r\nother hand, according to the Boches, Gervaise had gone back to her\r\nformer mate the very first night, just as soon as poor Coupeau had gone\r\nto sleep. The picture was not pretty, but there were a lot of worse\r\nthings in life, so folks ended by accepting the threesome as altogether\r\nnatural. In fact, they thought them rather nice since there were never\r\nany fights and the outward decencies remained. Certainly if you stuck\r\nyour nose into some of the other neighborhood households you could\r\nsmell far worse things. So what if they slept together like a nice\r\nlittle family. It never kept the neighbors awake. Besides, everyone was\r\nstill very much impressed by Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s good manners. His charm helped\r\ngreatly to keep tongues from wagging. Indeed, when the fruit dealer\r\ninsisted to the tripe seller that there had been no intimacies, the\r\nlatter appeared to feel that this was really too bad, because it made\r\nthe Coupeaus less interesting.\r\n\r\nGervaise was quite at her ease in this matter, and not much troubled\r\nwith these thoughts. Things reached the point that she was accused of\r\nbeing heartless. The family did not understand why she continued to\r\nbear a grudge against the hatter. Madame Lerat now came over every\r\nevening. She considered Lantier as utterly irresistible and said that\r\nmost ladies would be happy to fall into his arms. Madame Boche declared\r\nthat her own virtue would not be safe if she were ten years younger.\r\nThere was a sort of silent conspiracy to push Gervaise into the arms of\r\nLantier, as if all the women around her felt driven to satisfy their\r\nown longings by giving her a lover. Gervaise didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand this\r\nbecause she no longer found Lantier seductive. Certainly he had changed\r\nfor the better. He had gotten a sort of education in the cafes and\r\npolitical meetings but she knew him well. She could pierce to the\r\ndepths of his soul and she found things there that still gave her the\r\nshivers. Well, if the others found him so attractive, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ntry it themselves. In the end she suggested this one day to Virginie\r\nwho seemed the most eager. Then, to excite Gervaise, Madame Lerat and\r\nVirginie told her of the love of Lantier and tall Clemence. Yes, she\r\nhad not noticed anything herself; but as soon as she went out on an\r\nerrand, the hatter would bring the workgirl into his room. Now people\r\nmet them out together; he probably went to see her at her own place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the laundress, her voice trembling slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat can it\r\nmatter to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked straight into Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Did this woman still have it\r\nin for her?\r\n\r\nVirginie replied with an air of innocence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t matter to you, of course. Only, you ought to advise him to\r\nbreak off with that girl, who is sure to cause him some\r\nunpleasantness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that Lantier, feeling himself supported by public\r\nopinion, changed altogether in his behavior towards Gervaise. Now,\r\nwhenever he shook hands with her, he held her fingers for a minute\r\nbetween his own. He tried her with his glance, fixing a bold look upon\r\nher, in which she clearly read that he wanted her. If he passed behind\r\nher, he dug his knees into her skirt, or breathed upon her neck. Yet he\r\nwaited a while before being rough and openly declaring himself. But one\r\nevening, finding himself alone with her, he pushed her before him\r\nwithout a word, and viewed her all trembling against the wall at the\r\nback of the shop, and tried to kiss her. It so chanced that Goujet\r\nentered just at that moment. Then she struggled and escaped. And all\r\nthree exchanged a few words, as though nothing had happened. Goujet,\r\nhis face deadly pale, looked on the ground, fancying that he had\r\ndisturbed them, and that she had merely struggled so as not to be\r\nkissed before a third party.\r\n\r\nThe next day Gervaise moved restlessly about the shop. She was\r\nmiserable and unable to iron even a single handkerchief. She only\r\nwanted to see Goujet and explain to him how Lantier happened to have\r\npinned her against the wall. But since Etienne had gone to Lille, she\r\nhad hesitated to visit Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s forge where she felt she would be\r\ngreeted by his fellow workers with secret laughter. This afternoon,\r\nhowever, she yielded to the impulse. She took an empty basket and went\r\nout under the pretext of going for the petticoats of her customer on\r\nRue des Portes-Blanches. Then, when she reached Rue Marcadet, she\r\nwalked very slowly in front of the bolt factory, hoping for a lucky\r\nmeeting. Goujet must have been hoping to see her, too, for within five\r\nminutes he came out as if by chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been on an errand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you are on\r\nyour way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nActually Gervaise had her back toward Rue des Poissonniers. He only\r\nsaid that for something to say. They walked together up toward\r\nMontmartre, but without her taking his arm. They wanted to get a bit\r\naway from the factory so as not to seem to be having a rendezvous in\r\nfront of it. They turned into a vacant lot between a sawmill and a\r\nbutton factory. It was like a small green meadow. There was even a goat\r\ntied to a stake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d think you were in the\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went to sit under a dead tree. Gervaise placed the laundry basket\r\nby her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had an errand to do, and so I came out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt deeply ashamed and was afraid to try to explain. Yet she\r\nrealized that they had come here to discuss it. It remained a\r\ntroublesome burden.\r\n\r\nThen, all in a rush, with tears in her eyes, she told him of the death\r\nthat morning of Madame Bijard, her washerwoman. She had suffered\r\nhorrible agonies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband caused it by kicking her in the stomach,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a\r\nmonotone. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must have damaged her insides. _Mon Dieu!_ She was in\r\nagony for three days with her stomach all swelled up. Plenty of\r\nscoundrels have been sent to the galleys for less than that, but the\r\ncourts won\xe2\x80\x99t concern themselves with a wife-beater. Especially since\r\nthe woman said she had hurt herself falling. She wanted to save him\r\nfrom the scaffold, but she screamed all night long before she died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoujet clenched his hands and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe weaned her youngest only two weeks ago, little Jules,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise\r\nwent on. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for the baby, he won\xe2\x80\x99t have to suffer. Still,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s the child Lalie and she has two babies to look after. She isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neight yet, but she\xe2\x80\x99s already sensible. Her father will beat her now\r\neven more than before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoujet gazed at her silently. Then, his lips trembling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hurt me yesterday, yes, you hurt me badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise turned pale and clasped her hands as he continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would happen. You should have told me, you should have\r\ntrusted me enough to confess what was happening, so as not to leave me\r\nthinking that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoujet could not finish the sentence. Gervaise stood up, realizing that\r\nhe thought she had gone back with Lantier as the neighbors asserted.\r\nStretching her arms toward him, she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I swear to you. He was pushing against me, trying to kiss me,\r\nbut his face never even touched mine. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, and that was the first\r\ntime he tried. Oh, I swear on my life, on the life of my children, oh,\r\nbelieve me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGoujet was shaking his head. Gervaise said slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur Goujet, you know me well. You know that I do not lie. On my\r\nword of honor, it never happened, and it never will, do you understand?\r\nNever! I\xe2\x80\x99d be the lowest of the low if it ever happened, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeserve the friendship of an honest man like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed so sincere that he took her hand and made her sit down\r\nagain. He could breathe freely; his heart rejoiced. This was the first\r\ntime he had ever held her hand like this. He pressed it in his own and\r\nthey both sat quietly for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise said in a low voice.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother to deny it. We owe you so much money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hand tightly. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk of money. Finally\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking of something for a long time. You are not happy\r\nwhere you are. My mother tells me things are getting worse for you.\r\nWell, then, we can go away together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand at first and stared at him, startled by this\r\nsudden declaration of a love that he had never mentioned.\r\n\r\nFinally she asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get away from here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking down at the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo live somewhere else, in Belgium, if you wish. With both of us\r\nworking, we would soon be very comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise flushed. She thought she would have felt less shame if he had\r\ntaken her in his arms and kissed her. Goujet was an odd fellow,\r\nproposing to elope, just the way it happens in novels. Well, she had\r\nseen plenty of workingmen making up to married women, but they never\r\ntook them even as far as Saint-Denis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Monsieur Goujet,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, not knowing what else to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere would only be the two of us. It annoys\r\nme having others around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving regained her self-possession, however, she refused his proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, Monsieur Goujet. It would be very wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nmarried woman and I have children. We\xe2\x80\x99d soon regret it. I know you care\r\nfor me, and I care for you also, too much to let you do anything\r\nfoolish. It\xe2\x80\x99s much better to stay just as we are. We have respect for\r\neach other and that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a comfort to me many times. When\r\npeople in our situation stay on the straight, it is better in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head as he listened. He agreed with her and was unable to\r\noffer any arguments. Suddenly he pulled her into his arms and kissed\r\nher, crushing her. Then he let her go and said nothing more about their\r\nlove. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t angry. She felt they had earned that small moment of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nGoujet now didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with his hands, so he went around\r\npicking dandelions and tossing them into her basket. This amused him\r\nand gradually soothed him. Gervaise was becoming relaxed and cheerful.\r\nWhen they finally left the vacant lot they walked side by side and\r\ntalked of how much Etienne liked being at Lille. Her basket was full of\r\nyellow dandelions.\r\n\r\nGervaise, at heart, did not feel as courageous when with Lantier as she\r\nsaid. She was, indeed, perfectly resolved not to hear his flattery,\r\neven with the slightest interest; but she was afraid, if ever he should\r\ntouch her, of her old cowardice, of that feebleness and gloominess into\r\nwhich she allowed herself to glide, just to please people. Lantier,\r\nhowever, did not avow his affection. He several times found himself\r\nalone with her and kept quiet. He seemed to think of marrying the\r\ntripe-seller, a woman of forty-five and very well preserved. Gervaise\r\nwould talk of the tripe-seller in Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s presence, so as to set his\r\nmind at ease. She would say to Virginie and Madame Lerat, whenever they\r\nwere singing the hatter\xe2\x80\x99s praises, that he could very well do without\r\nher admiration, because all the women of the neighborhood were smitten\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nCoupeau went braying about everywhere that Lantier was a friend and a\r\ntrue one. People might jabber about them; he knew what he knew and did\r\nnot care a straw for their gossip, for he had respectability on his\r\nside. When they all three went out walking on Sundays, he made his wife\r\nand the hatter walk arm-in-arm before him, just by way of swaggering in\r\nthe street; and he watched the people, quite prepared to administer a\r\ndrubbing if anyone had ventured on the least joke. It was true that he\r\nregarded Lantier as a bit of a high flyer. He accused him of avoiding\r\nhard liquor and teased him because he could read and spoke like an\r\neducated man. Still, he accepted him as a regular comrade. They were\r\nideally suited to each other and friendship between men is more\r\nsubstantial than love for a woman.\r\n\r\nCoupeau and Lantier were forever going out junketing together. Lantier\r\nwould now borrow money from Gervaise\xe2\x80\x94ten francs, twenty francs at a\r\ntime, whenever he smelt there was money in the house. Then on those\r\ndays he would keep Coupeau away from his work, talk of some distant\r\nerrand and take him with him. Then seated opposite to each other in the\r\ncorner of some neighboring eating house, they would guzzle fancy dishes\r\nwhich one cannot get at home and wash them down with bottles of\r\nexpensive wine. The zinc-worker would have preferred to booze in a less\r\npretentious place, but he was impressed by the aristocratic tastes of\r\nLantier, who would discover on the bill of fare dishes with the most\r\nextraordinary names.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to understand a man so hard to please. Maybe it was from\r\nbeing a southerner. Lantier didn\xe2\x80\x99t like anything too rich and argued\r\nabout every dish, sending back meat that was too salty or too peppery.\r\nHe hated drafts. If a door was left open, he complained loudly. At the\r\nsame time, he was very stingy, only giving the waiter a tip of two sous\r\nfor a meal of seven or eight francs. He was treated with respect in\r\nspite of that.\r\n\r\nThe pair were well known along the exterior boulevards, from\r\nBatignolles to Belleville. They would go to the Grand Rue des\r\nBatignolles to eat tripe cooked in the Caen style. At the foot of\r\nMontmartre they obtained the best oysters in the neighborhood at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTown of Bar-le-Duc.\xe2\x80\x9d When they ventured to the top of the height as\r\nfar as the \xe2\x80\x9cGalette Windmill\xe2\x80\x9d they had a stewed rabbit. The \xe2\x80\x9cLilacs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin the Rue des Martyrs, had a reputation for their calf\xe2\x80\x99s head, whilst\r\nthe restaurant of the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Lion\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Chestnut Trees,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe Chaussee Clignancourt, served them stewed kidneys which made them\r\nlick their lips. Usually they went toward Belleville where they had\r\ntables reserved for them at some places of such excellent repute that\r\nyou could order anything with your eyes closed. These eating sprees\r\nwere always surreptitious and the next day they would refer to them\r\nindirectly while playing with the potatoes served by Gervaise. Once\r\nLantier brought a woman with him to the \xe2\x80\x9cGalette Windmill\xe2\x80\x9d and Coupeau\r\nleft immediately after dessert.\r\n\r\nOne naturally cannot both guzzle and work; so that ever since the\r\nhatter was made one of the family, the zinc-worker, who was already\r\npretty lazy, had got to the point of never touching a tool. When tired\r\nof doing nothing, he sometimes let himself be prevailed upon to take a\r\njob. Then his comrade would look him up and chaff him unmercifully when\r\nhe found him hanging to his knotty cord like a smoked ham, and he would\r\ncall to him to come down and have a glass of wine. And that settled it.\r\nThe zinc-worker would send the job to blazes and commence a booze which\r\nlasted days and weeks. Oh, it was a famous booze\xe2\x80\x94a general review of\r\nall the dram shops of the neighborhood, the intoxication of the morning\r\nslept off by midday and renewed in the evening; the goes of \xe2\x80\x9cvitriol\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsucceeded one another, becoming lost in the depths of the night, like\r\nthe Venetian lanterns of an illumination, until the last candle\r\ndisappeared with the last glass! That rogue of a hatter never kept on\r\nto the end. He let the other get elevated, then gave him the slip and\r\nreturned home smiling in his pleasant way. He could drink a great deal\r\nwithout people noticing it. When one got to know him well one could\r\nonly tell it by his half-closed eyes and his overbold behavior to\r\nwomen. The zinc-worker, on the contrary, became quite disgusting, and\r\ncould no longer drink without putting himself into a beastly state.\r\n\r\nThus, towards the beginning of November, Coupeau went in for a booze\r\nwhich ended in a most dirty manner, both for himself and the others.\r\nThe day before he had been offered a job. This time Lantier was full of\r\nfine sentiments; he lauded work, because work ennobles a man. In the\r\nmorning he even rose before it was light, for he gravely wished to\r\naccompany his friend to the workshop, honoring in him the workman\r\nreally worthy of the name. But when they arrived before the \xe2\x80\x9cLittle\r\nCivet,\xe2\x80\x9d which was just opening, they entered to have a plum in brandy,\r\nonly one, merely to drink together to the firm observance of a good\r\nresolution. On a bench opposite the counter, and with his back against\r\nthe wall, Bibi-the-Smoker was sitting smoking with a sulky look on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Bibi having a snooze,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you down in\r\nthe dumps, old bloke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the comrade, stretching his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the employers\r\nwho disgust me. I sent mine to the right about yesterday. They\xe2\x80\x99re all\r\ntoads and scoundrels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBibi-the-Smoker accepted a plum. He was, no doubt, waiting there on\r\nthat bench for someone to stand him a drink. Lantier, however, took the\r\npart of the employers; they often had some very hard times, as he who\r\nhad been in business himself well knew. The workers were a bad lot,\r\nforever getting drunk! They didn\xe2\x80\x99t take their work seriously. Sometimes\r\nthey quit in the middle of a job and only returned when they needed\r\nsomething in their pockets. Then Lantier would switch his attack to the\r\nemployers. They were nasty exploiters, regular cannibals. But he could\r\nsleep with a clear conscience as he had always acted as a friend to his\r\nemployees. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get rich the way others did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s be off, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, speaking to Coupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must be going\r\nor we shall be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBibi-the-Smoker followed them, swinging his arms. Outside the sun was\r\nscarcely rising, the pale daylight seemed dirtied by the muddy\r\nreflection of the pavement; it had rained the night before and it was\r\nvery mild. The gas lamps had just been turned out; the Rue des\r\nPoissonniers, in which shreds of night rent by the houses still\r\nfloated, was gradually filling with the dull tramp of the workmen\r\ndescending towards Paris. Coupeau, with his zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s bag slung\r\nover his shoulder, walked along in the imposing manner of a fellow who\r\nfeels in good form for a change. He turned round and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBibi, do you want a job. The boss told me to bring a pal if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bibi-the-Smoker; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m purging myself. You should\r\nask My-Boots. He was looking for something yesterday. Wait a minute.\r\nMy-Boots is most likely in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as they reached the bottom of the street they indeed caught sight\r\nof My-Boots inside Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s. In spite of the early hour\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was flaring, the shutters down, the gas lighted. Lantier\r\nstood at the door, telling Coupeau to make haste, because they had only\r\nten minutes left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You\xe2\x80\x99re going to work for that rascal Bourguignon?\xe2\x80\x9d yelled\r\nMy-Boots, when the zinc-worker had spoken to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch\r\nme in his hutch again! No, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go till next year with my tongue\r\nhanging out of my mouth. But, old fellow, you won\xe2\x80\x99t stay three days,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s I who tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally now, is it such a dirty hole?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Coupeau anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the dirtiest. You can\xe2\x80\x99t move there. The ape\xe2\x80\x99s for ever\r\non your back. And such queer ways too\xe2\x80\x94a missus who always says you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndrunk, a shop where you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t spit. I sent them to the right about\r\nthe first night, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood; now I\xe2\x80\x99m warned. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t stop there for ever. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go this\r\nmorning to see what it\xe2\x80\x99s like; but if the boss bothers me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch\r\nhim up and plant him upon his missus, you know, bang together like two\r\nfillets of sole!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Coupeau thanked his friend for the useful information and shook\r\nhis hand. As he was about to leave, My-Boots cursed angrily. Was that\r\nlousy Bourguignon going to stop them from having a drink? Weren\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\nfree any more? He could well wait another five minutes. Lantier came in\r\nto share in the round and they stood together at the counter. My-Boots,\r\nwith his smock black with dirt and his cap flattened on his head had\r\nrecently been proclaimed king of pigs and drunks after he had eaten a\r\nsalad of live beetles and chewed a piece of a dead cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay there, old Borgia,\xe2\x80\x9d he called to Pere Colombe, \xe2\x80\x9cgive us some of\r\nyour yellow stuff, first class mule\xe2\x80\x99s wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when Pere Colombe, pale and quiet in his blue-knitted waistcoat,\r\nhad filled the four glasses, these gentlemen tossed them off, so as not\r\nto let the liquor get flat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat does some good when it goes down,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bibi-the-Smoker.\r\n\r\nThe comic My-Boots had a story to tell. He was so drunk on the Friday\r\nthat his comrades had stuck his pipe in his mouth with a handful of\r\nplaster. Anyone else would have died of it; he merely strutted about\r\nand puffed out his chest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you gentlemen require anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pere Colombe in his\r\noily voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, fill us up again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow they were talking of women. Bibi-the-Smoker had taken his girl to\r\nan aunt\xe2\x80\x99s at Montrouge on the previous Sunday. Coupeau asked for the\r\nnews of the \xe2\x80\x9cIndian Mail,\xe2\x80\x9d a washerwoman of Chaillot who was known in\r\nthe establishment. They were about to drink, when My-Boots loudly\r\ncalled to Goujet and Lorilleux who were passing by. They came just to\r\nthe door, but would not enter. The blacksmith did not care to take\r\nanything. The chainmaker, pale and shivering, held in his pocket the\r\ngold chains he was going to deliver; and he coughed and asked them to\r\nexcuse him, saying that the least drop of brandy would nearly make him\r\nsplit his sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are hypocrites for you!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted My-Boots. \xe2\x80\x9cI bet they have\r\ntheir drinks on the sly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he had poked his nose in his glass he attacked Pere Colombe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVile druggist, you\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the bottle! You know it\xe2\x80\x99s no good your\r\ntrying to palm your cheap stuff off on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe day had advanced; a doubtful sort of light lit up l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir,\r\nwhere the landlord was turning out the gas. Coupeau found excuses for\r\nhis brother-in-law who could not stand drink, which after all was no\r\ncrime. He even approved Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s behavior for it was a real blessing\r\nnever to be thirsty. And as he talked of going off to his work Lantier,\r\nwith his grand air of a gentleman, sharply gave him a lesson. One at\r\nleast stood one\xe2\x80\x99s turn before sneaking off; one should not leave one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends like a mean blackguard, even when going to do one\xe2\x80\x99s duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he going to badger us much longer about his work?\xe2\x80\x9d cried My-Boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is your turn, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pere Colombe of Coupeau.\r\n\r\nThe latter paid. But when it came to Bibi-the-Smoker\xe2\x80\x99s turn he\r\nwhispered to the landlord who refused with a shake of the head.\r\nMy-Boots understood, and again set to abusing the old Jew Colombe.\r\nWhat! A rascal like him dared to behave in that way to a comrade!\r\nEverywhere else one could get drink on tick! It was only in such low\r\nboozing-dens that one was insulted! The landlord remained calm, leaning\r\nhis big fists on the edge of the counter. He politely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLend the gentleman some money\xe2\x80\x94that will be far simpler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend him some,\xe2\x80\x9d yelled My-Boots. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! Bibi,\r\nthrow this money in his face, the limb of Satan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, excited and annoyed at seeing Coupeau with his bag slung over his\r\nshoulder, he continued speaking to the zinc-worker:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look like a wet-nurse. Drop your brat. It\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a\r\nhump-back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau hesitated an instant; and then, quietly, as though he had only\r\nmade up his mind after considerable reflection, he laid his bag on the\r\nground saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Bourguignon\xe2\x80\x99s after lunch. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him\r\nthat the missus was ill. Listen, Pere Colombe, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave my tools\r\nunder this seat and I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for them at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier gave his blessing to this arrangement with an approving nod.\r\nLabor was necessary, yes, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re with good friends, courtesy\r\ncomes first. Now the four had five hours of idleness before them. They\r\nwere full of noisy merriment. Coupeau was especially relieved. They had\r\nanother round and then went to a small bar that had a billiard table.\r\n\r\nAt first Lantier turned up his nose at this establishment because it\r\nwas rather shabby. So much liquor had been spilled on the billiard\r\ntable that the balls stuck to it. Once the game got started though,\r\nLantier recovered his good humor and began to flaunt his extraordinary\r\nknack with a cue.\r\n\r\nWhen lunch time came Coupeau had an idea. He stamped his feet and\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must go and fetch Salted-Mouth. I know where he\xe2\x80\x99s working. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake him to Mere Louis\xe2\x80\x99 to have some pettitoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea was greeted with acclamation. Yes, Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, was no doubt in want of some pettitoes. They\r\nstarted off. Coupeau took them to the bolt factory in the Rue Marcadet.\r\nAs they arrived a good half hour before the time the workmen came out,\r\nthe zinc-worker gave a youngster two sous to go in and tell\r\nSalted-Mouth that his wife was ill and wanted him at once. The\r\nblacksmith made his appearance, waddling in his walk, looking very\r\ncalm, and scenting a tuck-out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you jokers!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as soon as he caught sight of them hiding in\r\na doorway. \xe2\x80\x9cI guessed it. Well, what are we going to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt mother Louis\xe2\x80\x99, whilst they sucked the little bones of the pettitoes,\r\nthey again fell to abusing the employers. Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, related that they had a most pressing order to\r\nexecute at the shop. Oh! the ape was pleasant for the time being. One\r\ncould be late, and he would say nothing; he no doubt considered himself\r\nlucky when one turned up at all. At any rate, no boss would dare to\r\nthrow Salted-Mouth out the door, because you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find lads of his\r\ncapacity any more. After the pettitoes they had an omelet. When each of\r\nthem had emptied his bottle, Mere Louis brought out some Auvergne wine,\r\nthick enough to cut with a knife. The party was really warming up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think is the ape\xe2\x80\x99s latest idea?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Salted-Mouth at\r\ndessert. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99s been and put a bell up in his shed! A bell! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood for slaves. Ah, well! It can ring to-day! They won\xe2\x80\x99t catch me\r\nagain at the anvil! For five days past I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sticking there; I may\r\ngive myself a rest now. If he deducts anything, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send him to\r\nblazes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coupeau, with an air of importance, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to leave\r\nyou; I\xe2\x80\x99m off to work. Yes, I promised my wife. Amuse yourselves; my\r\nspirit you know remains with my pals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others chuffed him. But he seemed so decided that they all\r\naccompanied him when he talked of going to fetch his tools from Pere\r\nColombe\xe2\x80\x99s. He took his bag from under the seat and laid it on the\r\nground before him whilst they had a final drink. But at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\nparty was still standing drinks. Then Coupeau, with a bored gesture\r\nplaced the tools back again under the seat. They were in his way; he\r\ncould not get near the counter without stumbling against them. It was\r\ntoo absurd; he would go to Bourguignon\xe2\x80\x99s on the morrow. The other four,\r\nwho were quarrelling about the question of salaries, were not at all\r\nsurprised when the zinc-worker, without any explanation, proposed a\r\nlittle stroll on the Boulevard, just to stretch their legs. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo very far. They seemed to have nothing to say to each other out in\r\nthe fresh air. Without even consulting each other with so much as a\r\nnudge, they slowly and instinctively ascended the Rue des Poissonniers,\r\nwhere they went to Francois\xe2\x80\x99s and had a glass of wine out of the\r\nbottle. Lantier pushed his comrades inside the private room at the\r\nback; it was a narrow place with only one table in it, and was\r\nseparated from the shop by a dull glazed partition. He liked to do his\r\ndrinking in private rooms because it seemed more respectable. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthey like it here? It was as comfortable as being at home. You could\r\neven take a nap here without being embarrassed. He called for the\r\nnewspaper, spread it out open before him, and looked through it,\r\nfrowning the while. Coupeau and My-Boots had commenced a game of\r\npiquet. Two bottles of wine and five glasses were scattered about the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThey emptied their glasses. Then Lantier read out loud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA frightful crime has just spread consternation throughout the Commune\r\nof Gaillon, Department of Seine-et-Marne. A son has killed his father\r\nwith blows from a spade in order to rob him of thirty sous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all uttered a cry of horror. There was a fellow whom they would\r\nhave taken great pleasure in seeing guillotined! No, the guillotine was\r\nnot enough; he deserved to be cut into little pieces. The story of an\r\ninfanticide equally aroused their indignation; but the hatter, highly\r\nmoral, found excuses for the woman, putting all the wrong on the back\r\nof her husband; for after all, if some beast of a man had not put the\r\nwretched woman into the way of bleak poverty, she could not have\r\ndrowned it in a water closet.\r\n\r\nThey were most delighted though by the exploit of a Marquis who, coming\r\nout of a dance hall at two in the morning, had defended himself against\r\nan attack by three blackguards on the Boulevard des Invalides. Without\r\ntaking off his gloves, he had disposed of the first two villains by\r\nramming his head into their stomachs, and then had marched the third\r\none off to the police. What a man! Too bad he was a noble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to this now,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lantier. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s some society news: \xe2\x80\x98A\r\nmarriage is arranged between the eldest daughter of the Countess de\r\nBretigny and the young Baron de Valancay, aide-de-camp to His Majesty.\r\nThe wedding trousseau will contain more than three hundred thousand\r\nfrancs\xe2\x80\x99 worth of lace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that to us?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Bibi-the-Smoker. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nknow the color of her mantle. The girl can have no end of lace;\r\nnevertheless she\xe2\x80\x99ll see the folly of loving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Lantier seemed about to continue his reading, Salted-Mouth,\r\notherwise Drink-without-Thirst, took the newspaper from him and sat\r\nupon it, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! no, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough! This is all the paper is good for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, My-Boots, who had been looking at his hand, triumphantly\r\nbanged his fist down on the table. He scored ninety-three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Revolution!\xe2\x80\x9d he exulted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck, comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d the others told Coupeau.\r\n\r\nThey ordered two fresh bottles. The glasses were filled up again as\r\nfast as they were emptied, the booze increased. Towards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock it\r\nbegan to get disgusting, so much so that Lantier kept very quiet,\r\nthinking of how to give the others the slip; brawling and throwing the\r\nwine about was no longer his style. Just then Coupeau stood up to make\r\nthe drunkard\xe2\x80\x99s sign of the cross. Touching his head he pronounced\r\nMontpernasse, then Menilmonte as he brought his hand to his right\r\nshoulder, Bagnolet giving himself a blow in the chest, and wound up by\r\nsaying stewed rabbit three times as he hit himself in the pit of the\r\nstomach. Then the hatter took advantage of the clamor which greeted the\r\nperformance of this feat and quietly made for the door. His comrades\r\ndid not even notice his departure. He had already had a pretty good\r\ndose. But once outside he shook himself and regained his\r\nself-possession; and he quietly made for the shop, where he told\r\nGervaise that Coupeau was with some friends.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed by. The zinc-worker had not returned. He was reeling\r\nabout the neighborhood, but no one knew exactly where. Several persons,\r\nhowever, stated that they had seen him at mother Baquet\xe2\x80\x99s, at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly,\xe2\x80\x9d and at the \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Old Man with a Cough.\xe2\x80\x9d Only some said\r\nthat he was alone, whilst others affirmed that he was in the company of\r\nseven or eight drunkards like himself. Gervaise shrugged her shoulders\r\nin a resigned sort of way. _Mon Dieu!_ She just had to get used to it.\r\nShe never ran about after her old man; she even went out of her way if\r\nshe caught sight of him inside a wineshop, so as to not anger him; and\r\nshe waited at home till he returned, listening at night-time to hear if\r\nhe was snoring outside the door. He would sleep on a rubbish heap, or\r\non a seat, or in a piece of waste land, or across a gutter. On the\r\nmorrow, after having only badly slept off his booze of the day before,\r\nhe would start off again, knocking at the doors of all the consolation\r\ndealers, plunging afresh into a furious wandering, in the midst of nips\r\nof spirits, glasses of wine, losing his friends and then finding them\r\nagain, going regular voyages from which he returned in a state of\r\nstupor, seeing the streets dance, the night fall and the day break,\r\nwithout any other thought than to drink and sleep off the effects\r\nwherever he happened to be. When in the latter state, the world was\r\nended so far as he was concerned. On the second day, however, Gervaise\r\nwent to Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir to find out something about him; he\r\nhad been there another five times, they were unable to tell her\r\nanything more. All she could do was to take away his tools which he had\r\nleft under a seat.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Lantier, seeing that the laundress seemed very worried,\r\noffered to take her to a music-hall, just by way of passing a pleasant\r\nhour or two. She refused at first, she was in no mood for laughing.\r\nOtherwise she would not have said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d for the hatter made the\r\nproposal in too straightforward a manner for her to feel any mistrust.\r\nHe seemed to feel for her in quite a paternal way. Never before had\r\nCoupeau slept out two nights running. So that in spite of herself, she\r\nwould go every ten minutes to the door, with her iron in her hand, and\r\nlook up and down the street to see if her old man was coming.\r\n\r\nIt might be that Coupeau had broken a leg, or fallen under a wagon and\r\nbeen crushed and that might be good riddance to bad rubbish. She saw no\r\nreason for cherishing in her heart any affection for a filthy character\r\nlike him, but it was irritating, all the same, to have to wonder every\r\nnight whether he would come in or not. When it got dark, Lantier again\r\nsuggested the music-hall, and this time she accepted. She decided it\r\nwould be silly to deny herself a little pleasure when her husband had\r\nbeen out on the town for three days. If he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming in, then she\r\nmight as well go out herself. Let the entire dump burn up if it felt\r\nlike it. She might even put a torch to it herself. She was getting\r\ntired of the boring monotony of her present life.\r\n\r\nThey ate their dinner quickly. Then, when she went off at eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, arm-in-arm with the hatter, Gervaise told mother Coupeau and\r\nNana to go to bed at once. The shop was shut and the shutters up. She\r\nleft by the door opening into the courtyard and gave Madame Boche the\r\nkey, asking her, if her pig of a husband came home, to have the\r\nkindness to put him to bed. The hatter was waiting for her under the\r\nbig doorway, arrayed in his best and whistling a tune. She had on her\r\nsilk dress. They walked slowly along the pavement, keeping close to\r\neach other, lighted up by the glare from the shop windows which showed\r\nthem smiling and talking together in low voices.\r\n\r\nThe music-hall was in the Boulevard de Rochechouart. It had originally\r\nbeen a little cafe and had been enlarged by means of a kind of wooden\r\nshed erected in the courtyard. At the door a string of glass globes\r\nformed a luminous porch. Tall posters pasted on boards stood upon the\r\nground, close to the gutter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-night, first appearance of\r\nMademoiselle Amanda, serio-comic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he caught sight of Bibi-the-Smoker, who was also reading the\r\nposter. Bibi had a black eye; some punch he had run up against the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Where\xe2\x80\x99s Coupeau?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the hatter, looking about. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you,\r\nthen, lost Coupeau?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! long ago, since yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a bit of\r\na free-for-all on leaving mother Baquet\xe2\x80\x99s. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for fisticuffs.\r\nWe had a row, you know, with mother Baquet\xe2\x80\x99s pot-boy, because he wanted\r\nto make us pay for a quart twice over. Then I left. I went and had a\r\nbit of a snooze.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still yawning; he had slept eighteen hours at a stretch. He was,\r\nmoreover, quite sobered, with a stupid look on his face, and his jacket\r\nsmothered with fluff; for he had no doubt tumbled into bed with his\r\nclothes on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where my husband is, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the laundress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, not a bit. It was five o\xe2\x80\x99clock when we left mother Baquet\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all I know about it. Perhaps he went down the street. Yes, I\r\nfancy now that I saw him go to the \xe2\x80\x98Butterfly\xe2\x80\x99 with a coachman. Oh! how\r\nstupid it is! Really, we deserve to be shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier and Gervaise spent a very pleasant evening at the music-hall.\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the place closed, they strolled home without\r\nhurrying themselves. The cold was quite sharp. People seemed to be in\r\ngroups. Some of the girls were giggling in the darkness as their men\r\npressed close to them. Lantier was humming one of Mademoiselle Amanda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsongs. Gervaise, with her head spinning from too much drink, hummed the\r\nrefrain with him. It had been very warm at the music-hall and the two\r\ndrinks she had had, along with all the smoke, had upset her stomach a\r\nbit. She had been quite impressed with Mademoiselle Amanda. She\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to appear in public wearing so little, but she had to\r\nadmit that the lady had lovely skin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone\xe2\x80\x99s asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, after ringing three times without\r\nthe Boches opening the door.\r\n\r\nAt length the door opened, but inside the porch it was very dark, and\r\nwhen she knocked at the window of the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s room to ask for her\r\nkey, the concierge, who was half asleep, pulled out some rigmarole\r\nwhich she could make nothing of at first. She eventually understood\r\nthat Poisson, the policeman, had brought Coupeau home in a frightful\r\nstate, and that the key was no doubt in the lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deuce!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Lantier, when they had entered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever has he\r\nbeen up to here? The stench is abominable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a most powerful stench. As Gervaise went to look for\r\nmatches, she stepped into something messy. After she succeeded in\r\nlighting a candle, a pretty sight met their eyes. Coupeau appeared to\r\nhave disgorged his very insides. The bed was splattered all over, so\r\nwas the carpet, and even the bureau had splashes on its sides. Besides\r\nthat, he had fallen from the bed where Poisson had probably thrown him,\r\nand was snoring on the floor in the midst of the filth like a pig\r\nwallowing in the mire, exhaling his foul breath through his open mouth.\r\nHis grey hair was straggling into the puddle around his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the pig! the pig!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gervaise, indignant and exasperated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dirtied everything. No, a dog wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that, even a\r\ndead dog is cleaner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both hesitated to move, not knowing where to place their feet.\r\nCoupeau had never before come home and put the bedroom into such a\r\nshocking state. This sight was a blow to whatever affection his wife\r\nstill had for him. Previously she had been forgiving and not seriously\r\noffended, even when he had been blind drunk. But this made her sick; it\r\nwas too much. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have touched Coupeau for the world, and just\r\nthe thought of this filthy bum touching her caused a repugnance such as\r\nshe might have felt had she been required to sleep beside the corpse of\r\nsomeone who had died from a terrible disease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I must get into that bed,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go and sleep in\r\nthe street. Oh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll crawl into it foot first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to step over the drunkard, but had to catch hold of a corner\r\nof the chest of drawers to save herself from slipping in the mess.\r\nCoupeau completely blocked the way to the bed. Then, Lantier, who\r\nlaughed to himself on seeing that she certainly could not sleep on her\r\nown pillow that night, took hold of her hand, saying, in a low and\r\nangry voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGervaise, he is a pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe understood what he meant and pulled her hand free. She sighed to\r\nherself, and, in her bewilderment, addressed him familiarly, as in the\r\nold days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, leave me alone, Auguste. Go to your own bed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll manage somehow\r\nto lie at the foot of the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Gervaise, don\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too abominable;\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t remain here. Come with me. He won\xe2\x80\x99t hear us. What are you\r\nafraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied firmly, shaking her head vigorously. Then, to show\r\nthat she would remain where she was, she began to take off her clothes,\r\nthrowing her silk dress over a chair. She was quickly in only her\r\nchemise and petticoat. Well, it was her own bed. She wanted to sleep in\r\nher own bed and made two more attempts to reach a clean corner of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nLantier, having no intention of giving up, whispered things to her.\r\n\r\nWhat a predicament she was in, with a louse of a husband that prevented\r\nher from crawling under her own blankets and a low skunk behind her\r\njust waiting to take advantage of the situation to possess her again.\r\nShe begged Lantier to be quiet. Turning toward the small room where\r\nNana and mother Coupeau slept, she listened anxiously. She could hear\r\nonly steady breathing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, Auguste,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll wake them. Be\r\nsensible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLantier didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer, but just smiled at her. Then he began to kiss\r\nher on the ear just as in the old days.\r\n\r\nGervaise felt like sobbing. Her strength deserted her; she felt a great\r\nbuzzing in her ears, a violent tremor passed through her. She advanced\r\nanother step forward. And she was again obliged to draw back. It was\r\nnot possible, the disgust was too great. She felt on the verge of\r\nvomiting herself. Coupeau, overpowered by intoxication, lying as\r\ncomfortably as though on a bed of down, was sleeping off his booze,\r\nwithout life in his limbs, and with his mouth all on one side. The\r\nwhole street might have entered and laughed at him, without a hair of\r\nhis body moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s his own fault. _Mon Dieu!_\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s forcing me out of my own bed. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no bed any longer. No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it. It\xe2\x80\x99s his own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was trembling so she scarcely knew what she was doing. While\r\nLantier was urging her into his room, Nana\xe2\x80\x99s face appeared at one of\r\nthe glass panes in the door of the little room. The young girl, pale\r\nfrom sleep, had awakened and gotten out of bed quietly. She stared at\r\nher father lying in his vomit. Then, she stood watching until her\r\nmother disappeared into Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s room. She watched with the intensity\r\nand the wide-open eyes of a vicious child aflame with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThat winter mother Coupeau nearly went off in one of her coughing fits.\r\nEach December she could count on her asthma keeping her on her back for\r\ntwo and three weeks at a time. She was no longer fifteen, she would be\r\nseventy-three on Saint-Anthony\xe2\x80\x99s day. With that she was very rickety,\r\ngetting a rattling in her throat for nothing at all, though she was\r\nplump and stout. The doctor said she would go off coughing, just time\r\nenough to say: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, the candle\xe2\x80\x99s out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she was in her bed mother Coupeau became positively unbearable. It\r\nis true though that the little room in which she slept with Nana was\r\nnot at all gay. There was barely room for two chairs between the beds.\r\nThe wallpaper, a faded gray, hung loose in long strips. The small\r\nwindow near the ceiling let in only a dim light. It was like a cavern.\r\nAt night, as she lay awake, she could listen to the breathing of the\r\nsleeping Nana as a sort of distraction; but in the day-time, as there\r\nwas no one to keep her company from morning to night, she grumbled and\r\ncried and repeated to herself for hours together, as she rolled her\r\nhead on the pillow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! What a miserable creature I am! Good heavens! What a\r\nmiserable creature I am! They\xe2\x80\x99ll leave me to die in prison, yes, in\r\nprison!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as anyone called, Virginie or Madame Boche, to ask after her\r\nhealth, she would not reply directly, but immediately started on her\r\nlist of complaints: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I pay dearly for the food I eat here. I\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nmuch better off with strangers. I asked for a cup of tisane and they\r\nbrought me an entire pot of hot water. It was a way of saying that I\r\ndrank too much. I brought Nana up myself and she scurries away in her\r\nbare feet every morning and I never see her again all day. Then at\r\nnight she sleeps so soundly that she never wakes up to ask me if I\xe2\x80\x99m in\r\npain. I\xe2\x80\x99m just a nuisance to them. They\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for me to die. That\r\nwill happen soon enough. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a son any more; that\r\nlaundress has taken him from me. She\xe2\x80\x99d beat me to death if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nafraid of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise was indeed rather hasty at times. The place was going to the\r\ndogs, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s temper was getting spoilt and they sent each other to\r\nthe right about for the least word. Coupeau, one morning that he had a\r\nhangover, exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cThe old thing\xe2\x80\x99s always saying she\xe2\x80\x99s going to die,\r\nand yet she never does!\xe2\x80\x9d The words struck mother Coupeau to the heart.\r\nThey frequently complained of how much she cost them, observing that\r\nthey would save a lot of money when she was gone.\r\n\r\nWhen at her worst that winter, one afternoon, when Madame Lorilleux and\r\nMadame Lerat had met at her bedside, mother Coupeau winked her eye as a\r\nsignal to them to lean over her. She could scarcely speak. She rather\r\nhissed than said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s becoming indecent. I heard them last night. Yes, Clump-clump and\r\nthe hatter. And they were kicking up such a row together! Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\ndecent for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she related in short sentences, coughing and choking between each,\r\nthat her son had come home dead drunk the night before. Then, as she\r\nwas not asleep, she was easily able to account for all the noises, of\r\nClump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s bare feet tripping over the tiled floor, the hissing\r\nvoice of the hatter calling her, the door between the two rooms gently\r\nclosed, and the rest. It must have lasted till daylight. She could not\r\ntell the exact time, because, in spite of her efforts, she had ended by\r\nfalling into a dose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s most disgusting is that Nana might have heard everything,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued she. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was indeed restless all the night, she who usually\r\nsleeps so sound. She tossed about and kept turning over as though there\r\nhad been some lighted charcoal in her bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other two women did not seem at all surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Lorilleux, \xe2\x80\x9cit probably began the very\r\nfirst night. But as it pleases Coupeau, we\xe2\x80\x99ve no business to interfere.\r\nAll the same, it\xe2\x80\x99s not very respectable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Madame Lerat through clenched teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99d been\r\nthere, I\xe2\x80\x99d have thrown a fright into them. I\xe2\x80\x99d have shouted something,\r\nanything. A doctor\xe2\x80\x99s maid told me once that the doctor had told her\r\nthat a surprise like that, at a certain moment, could strike a woman\r\ndead. If she had died right there, that would have been well, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit? She would have been punished right where she had sinned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long until the entire neighborhood knew that Gervaise visited\r\nLantier\xe2\x80\x99s room every night. Madame Lorilleux was loudly indignant,\r\ncalling her brother a poor fool whose wife had shamed him. And her poor\r\nmother, forced to live in the midst of such horrors. As a result, the\r\nneighbors blamed Gervaise. Yes, she must have led Lantier astray; you\r\ncould see it in her eyes. In spite of the nasty gossip, Lantier was\r\nstill liked because he was always so polite. He always had candy or\r\nflowers to give the ladies. _Mon Dieu!_ Men shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to\r\npush away women who threw themselves at them. There was no excuse for\r\nGervaise. She was a disgrace. The Lorilleuxs used to bring Nana up to\r\ntheir apartment in order to find out more details from her, their\r\ngodchild. But Nana would put on her expression of innocent stupidity\r\nand lower her long silky eyelashes to hide the fire in her eyes as she\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this general indignation, Gervaise lived quietly on,\r\nfeeling tired out and half asleep. At first she considered herself very\r\nsinful and felt a disgust for herself. When she left Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s room she\r\nwould wash her hands and scrub herself as if trying to get rid of an\r\nevil stain. If Coupeau then tried to joke with her, she would fly into\r\na passion, and run and shiveringly dress herself in the farthest corner\r\nof the shop; neither would she allow Lantier near her soon after her\r\nhusband had kissed her. She would have liked to have changed her skin\r\nas she changed men. But she gradually became accustomed to it. Soon it\r\nwas too much trouble to scrub herself each time. Her thirst for\r\nhappiness led her to enjoy as much as she could the difficult\r\nsituation. She had always been disposed to make allowances for herself,\r\nso why not for others? She only wanted to avoid causing trouble. As\r\nlong as the household went along as usual, there was nothing to\r\ncomplain about.\r\n\r\nThen, after all, she could not be doing anything to make Coupeau stop\r\ndrinking; matters were arranged so easily to the general satisfaction.\r\nOne is generally punished if one does what is not right. His\r\ndissoluteness had gradually become a habit. Now it was as regular an\r\naffair as eating and drinking. Each time Coupeau came home drunk, she\r\nwould go to Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s room. This was usually on Mondays, Tuesdays and\r\nWednesdays. Sometimes on other nights, if Coupeau was snoring too\r\nloudly, she would leave in the middle of the night. It was not that she\r\ncared more for Lantier, but just that she slept better in his room.\r\n\r\nMother Coupeau never dared speak openly of it. But after a quarrel,\r\nwhen the laundress had bullied her, the old woman was not sparing in\r\nher allusions. She would say that she knew men who were precious fools\r\nand women who were precious hussies, and she would mutter words far\r\nmore biting, with the sharpness of language pertaining to an old\r\nwaistcoat-maker. The first time this had occurred Gervaise looked at\r\nher straight in the face without answering. Then, also avoiding going\r\ninto details, she began to defend herself with reasons given in a\r\ngeneral sort of way. When a woman had a drunkard for a husband, a pig\r\nwho lived in filth, that woman was to be excused if she sought for\r\ncleanliness elsewhere. Once she pointed out that Lantier was just as\r\nmuch her husband as Coupeau was. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she known him since she was\r\nfourteen and didn\xe2\x80\x99t she have children by him?\r\n\r\nAnyway, she\xe2\x80\x99d like to see anyone make trouble for her. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the\r\nonly one around the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or. Madame Vigouroux, the\r\ncoal-dealer had a merry dance from morning to night. Then there was the\r\ngrocer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Madame Lehongre with her brother-in-law. _Mon Dieu!_\r\nWhat a slob of a fellow. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth touching with a shovel. Even\r\nthe neat little clockmaker was said to have carried on with his own\r\ndaughter, a streetwalker. Ah, the entire neighborhood. Oh, she knew\r\nplenty of dirt.\r\n\r\nOne day when mother Coupeau was more pointed than usual in her\r\nobservations, Gervaise had replied to her, clinching her teeth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re confined to your bed and you take advantage of it. Listen!\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. You see that I behave nicely to you, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve never\r\nthrown your past life into your teeth. Oh! I know all about it. No,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t cough. I\xe2\x80\x99ve finished what I had to say. It\xe2\x80\x99s only to request you\r\nto mind your own business, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman almost choked. On the morrow, Goujet having called about\r\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s washing when Gervaise happened to be out, mother Coupeau\r\ncalled him to her and kept him some time seated beside her bed. She\r\nknew all about the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s friendship, and had noticed that for\r\nsome time past he had looked dismal and wretched, from a suspicion of\r\nthe melancholy things that were taking place. So, for the sake of\r\ngossiping, and out of revenge for the quarrel of the day before, she\r\nbluntly told him the truth, weeping and complaining as though\r\nGervaise\xe2\x80\x99s wicked behavior did her some special injury. When Goujet\r\nquitted the little room, he leant against the wall, almost stifling\r\nwith grief. Then, when the laundress returned home, mother Coupeau\r\ncalled to her that Madame Goujet required her to go round with her\r\nclothes, ironed or not; and she was so animated that Gervaise, seeing\r\nsomething was wrong, guessed what had taken place and had a\r\npresentiment of the unpleasantness which awaited her.\r\n\r\nVery pale, her limbs already trembling, she placed the things in a\r\nbasket and started off. For years past she had not returned the Goujets\r\na sou of their money. The debt still amounted to four hundred and\r\ntwenty-five francs. She always spoke of her embarrassments and received\r\nthe money for the washing. It filled her with shame, because she seemed\r\nto be taking advantage of the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s friendship to make a fool of\r\nhim. Coupeau, who had now become less scrupulous, would chuckle and say\r\nthat Goujet no doubt had fooled around with her a bit, and had so paid\r\nhimself. But she, in spite of the relations she had fallen into with\r\nCoupeau, would indignantly ask her husband if he already wished to eat\r\nof that sort of bread. She would not allow anyone to say a word against\r\nGoujet in her presence; her affection for the blacksmith remained like\r\na last shred of her honor. Thus, every time she took the washing home\r\nto those worthy people, she felt a spasm of her heart the moment she\r\nput a foot on their stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it\xe2\x80\x99s you, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Goujet sharply, on opening the\r\ndoor to her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m in want of death, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send you to fetch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise entered, greatly embarrassed, not even daring to mutter an\r\nexcuse. She was no longer punctual, never came at the time arranged,\r\nand would keep her customers waiting for days on end. Little by little\r\nshe was giving way to a system of thorough disorder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a week past I\xe2\x80\x99ve been expecting you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the lace-mender.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you tell falsehoods too; you send your apprentice to me with all\r\nsorts of stories; you are then busy with my things, you will deliver\r\nthem the same evening, or else you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an accident, the bundle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfallen into a pail of water. Whilst all this is going on, I waste my\r\ntime, nothing turns up, and it worries me exceedingly. No, you\xe2\x80\x99re most\r\nunreasonable. Come, what have you in your basket? Is everything there\r\nnow? Have you brought me the pair of sheets you\xe2\x80\x99ve been keeping back\r\nfor a month past, and the chemise which was missing the last time you\r\nbrought home the washing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the chemise. Here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Madame Goujet cried out. That chemise was not hers, she would have\r\nnothing to do with it. Her things were changed now; it was too bad!\r\nOnly the week before, there were two handkerchiefs which hadn\xe2\x80\x99t her\r\nmark on them. It was not to her taste to have clothes coming from no\r\none knew where. Besides that, she liked to have her own things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the sheets?\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re lost, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? Well! Woman,\r\nyou must see about them, for I insist upon having them to-morrow\r\nmorning, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a silence which particularly bothered Gervaise when she\r\nnoticed that the door to Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s room was open. If he was in there, it\r\nwas most annoying that he should hear these just criticisms. She made\r\nno reply, meekly bowing her head, and placing the laundry on the bed as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\nMatters became worse when Madame Goujet began to look over the things,\r\none by one. She took hold of them and threw them down again saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you don\xe2\x80\x99t get them up nearly so well as you used to do. One can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncompliment you every day now. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to mucking your\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94doing it in a most slovenly way. Just look at this shirt-front,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s scorched, there\xe2\x80\x99s the mark of the iron on the plaits; and the\r\nbuttons have all been torn off. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you manage it, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s never a button left on anything. Oh! now, here\xe2\x80\x99s a petticoat\r\nbody which I shall certainly not pay you for. Look there! The dirt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstill on it, you\xe2\x80\x99ve simply smoothed it over. So now the things are not\r\neven clean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped whilst she counted the different articles. Then she\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! This is all you\xe2\x80\x99ve brought? There are two pairs of stockings,\r\nsix towels, a table-cloth, and several dish-cloths short. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nregularly trifling with me, it seems! I sent word that you were to\r\nbring me everything, ironed or not. If your apprentice isn\xe2\x80\x99t here on\r\nthe hour with the rest of the things, we shall fall out, Madame\r\nCoupeau, I warn you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Goujet coughed in his room. Gervaise slightly started.\r\n_Mon Dieu!_ How she was treated before him. And she remained standing\r\nin the middle of the rooms, embarrassed and confused and waiting for\r\nthe dirty clothes; but after making up the account Madame Goujet had\r\nquietly returned to her seat near the window, and resumed the mending\r\nof a lace shawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the dirty things?\xe2\x80\x9d timidly inquired the laundress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old woman, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be no laundry this\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise turned pale. She was no longer to have the washing. Then she\r\nquite lost her head; she was obliged to sit down on a chair, for her\r\nlegs were giving way under her. She did not attempt to vindicate\r\nherself. All that she would find to say was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Monsieur Goujet ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, he was not well. He had been obliged to come home instead of\r\nreturning to the forge, and he had gone to lie down on his bed to get a\r\nrest. Madame Goujet talked gravely, wearing her black dress as usual\r\nand her white face framed in her nun-like coif. The pay at the forge\r\nhad been cut again. It was now only seven francs a day because the\r\nmachines did so much of the work. This forced her to save money every\r\nway she could. She would do her own washing from now on. It would\r\nnaturally have been very helpful if the Coupeaus had been able to\r\nreturn her the money lent them by her son; but she was not going to set\r\nthe lawyers on them, as they were unable to pay. As she was talking\r\nabout the debt, Gervaise lowered her eyes in embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the lace-maker, \xe2\x80\x9cby pinching yourselves a\r\nlittle you could manage to pay it off. For really now, you live very\r\nwell; and spend a great deal, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. If you were only to pay off ten\r\nfrancs a month\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by the sound of Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s voice as he called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when she returned to her seat, which was almost immediately, she\r\nchanged the conversation. The blacksmith had doubtless begged her not\r\nto ask Gervaise for money; but in spite of herself she again spoke of\r\nthe debt at the expiration of five minutes. Oh! She had foreseen long\r\nago what was now happening. Coupeau was drinking all that the laundry\r\nbusiness brought in and dragging his wife down with him. Her son would\r\nnever have loaned the money if he had only listened to her. By now he\r\nwould have been married, instead of miserably sad with only unhappiness\r\nto look forward to for the rest of his life. She grew quite stern and\r\nangry, even accusing Gervaise of having schemed with Coupeau to take\r\nadvantage of her foolish son. Yes, some women were able to play the\r\nhypocrite for years, but eventually the truth came out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d again called Goujet, but louder this time.\r\n\r\nShe rose from her seat and when she returned she said, as she resumed\r\nher lace mending:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in, he wishes to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, all in a tremble left the door open. This scene filled her\r\nwith emotion because it was like an avowal of their affection before\r\nMadame Goujet. She again beheld the quiet little chamber, with its\r\nnarrow iron bedstead, and papered all over with pictures, the whole\r\nlooking like the room of some girl of fifteen. Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s big body was\r\nstretched on the bed. Mother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s disclosures and the things his\r\nmother had been saying seemed to have knocked all the life out of his\r\nlimbs. His eyes were red and swollen, his beautiful yellow beard was\r\nstill wet. In the first moment of rage he must have punched away at his\r\npillow with his terrible fists, for the ticking was split and the\r\nfeathers were coming out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, mamma\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the laundress in a voice that was\r\nscarcely audible. \xe2\x80\x9cYou owe me nothing. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it mentioned\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had raised himself up and was looking at her. Big tears at once\r\nfilled his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suffer, Monsieur Goujet?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter\r\nwith you? Tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, thanks. I tired myself with too much work yesterday. I will\r\nrest a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, his heart breaking, he could not restrain himself and burst out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ It was never to be\xe2\x80\x94never. You swore it.\r\nAnd now it is\xe2\x80\x94it is! Ah, it pains me too much, leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with his hand he gently and imploringly motioned to her to go. She\r\ndid not draw nearer to the bed. She went off as he requested her to,\r\nfeeling stupid, unable to say anything to soothe him. When in the other\r\nroom she took up her basket; but she did not go home. She stood there\r\ntrying to find something to say. Madame Goujet continued her mending\r\nwithout raising her head. It was she who at length said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Good-night; send me back my things and we will settle up\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be best so\xe2\x80\x94good-night,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Gervaise.\r\n\r\nShe took a last look around the neatly arranged room and thought as she\r\nshut the door that she seemed to be leaving some part of her better\r\nself behind. She plodded blindly back to the laundry, scarcely knowing\r\nwhere she was going.\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise arrived, she found mother Coupeau out of her bed, sitting\r\non a chair by the stove. Gervaise was too tired to scold her. Her bones\r\nached as though she had been beaten and she was thinking that her life\r\nwas becoming too hard to bear. Surely a quick death was the only escape\r\nfrom the pain in her heart.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Gervaise became indifferent to everything. With a vague\r\ngesture of her hand she would send everybody about their business. At\r\neach fresh worry she buried herself deeper in her only pleasure, which\r\nwas to have her three meals a day. The shop might have collapsed. So\r\nlong as she was not beneath it, she would have gone off willingly\r\nwithout a chemise to her back. And the little shop was collapsing, not\r\nsuddenly, but little by little, morning and evening. One by one the\r\ncustomers got angry, and sent their washing elsewhere. Monsieur\r\nMadinier, Mademoiselle Remanjou, the Boches themselves had returned to\r\nMadame Fauconnier, where they could count on great punctuality. One\r\nends by getting tired of asking for a pair of stockings for three weeks\r\nstraight, and of putting on shirts with grease stains dating from the\r\nprevious Sunday. Gervaise, without losing a bite, wished them a\r\npleasant journey, and spoke her mind about them, saying that she was\r\nprecious glad she would no longer have to poke her nose into their\r\nfilth. The entire neighborhood could quit her; that would relieve her\r\nof the piles of stinking junk and give her less work to do.\r\n\r\nNow her only customers were those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay regularly, the\r\nstreet-walkers, and women like Madame Gaudron, whose laundry smelled so\r\nbad that not one of the laundresses on the Rue Neuve would take it. She\r\nhad to let Madame Putois go, leaving only her apprentice, squint-eyed\r\nAugustine, who seemed to grow more stupid as time passed. Frequently\r\nthere was not even enough work for the two of them and they sat on\r\nstools all afternoon doing nothing.\r\n\r\nWhilst idleness and poverty entered, dirtiness naturally entered also.\r\nOne would never have recognised that beautiful blue shop, the color of\r\nheaven, which had once been Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s pride. Its window-frames and\r\npanes, which were never washed, were covered from top to bottom with\r\nthe splashes of the passing vehicles. On the brass rods in the windows\r\nwere displayed three grey rags left by customers who had died in the\r\nhospital. And inside it was more pitiable still; the dampness of the\r\nclothes hung up at the ceiling to dry had loosed all the wallpaper; the\r\nPompadour chintz hung in strips like cobwebs covered with dust; the big\r\nstove, broken and in holes from the rough use of the poker, looked in\r\nits corner like the stock in trade of a dealer in old iron; the\r\nwork-table appeared as though it had been used by a regiment, covered\r\nas it was with wine and coffee stains, sticky with jam, greasy from\r\nspilled gravy.\r\n\r\nGervaise was so at ease among it all that she never even noticed the\r\nshop was getting filthy. She became used to it all, just as she got\r\nused to wearing torn skirts and no longer washing herself carefully.\r\nThe disorder was like a warm nest.\r\n\r\nHer own ease was her sole consideration; she did not care a pin for\r\nanything else. The debts, though still increasing, no longer troubled\r\nher. Her honesty gradually deserted her; whether she would be able to\r\npay or not was altogether uncertain, and she preferred not to think\r\nabout it. When her credit was stopped at one shop, she would open an\r\naccount at some other shop close by. She was in debt all over the\r\nneighborhood, she owed money every few yards. To take merely the Rue de\r\nla Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, she no longer dared pass in front of the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s, nor\r\nthe charcoal-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s, nor the greengrocer\xe2\x80\x99s; and this obliged her,\r\nwhenever she required to be at the wash-house, to go round by the Rue\r\ndes Poissonniers, which was quite ten minutes out of her way. The\r\ntradespeople came and treated her as a swindler. One evening the dealer\r\nfrom whom she had purchased Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s furniture made a scene in the\r\nstreet. Scenes like this upset her at the time, but were soon forgotten\r\nand never spoiled her appetite. What a nerve to bother her like that\r\nwhen she had no money to pay. They were all robbers anyway and it\r\nserved them right to have to wait. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99d have to go bankrupt, but\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend to fret about it now.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile mother Coupeau had recovered. For another year the household\r\njogged along. During the summer months there was naturally a little\r\nmore work\xe2\x80\x94the white petticoats and the cambric dresses of the\r\nstreet-walkers of the exterior Boulevard. The catastrophe was slowly\r\napproaching; the home sank deeper into the mire every week; there were\r\nups and downs, however\xe2\x80\x94days when one had to rub one\xe2\x80\x99s stomach before\r\nthe empty cupboard, and others when one ate veal enough to make one\r\nburst. Mother Coupeau was for ever being seen in the street, hiding\r\nbundles under her apron, and strolling in the direction of the\r\npawn-place in the Rue Polonceau. She strutted along with the air of a\r\ndevotee going to mass; for she did not dislike these errands; haggling\r\nabout money amused her; this crying up of her wares like a second-hand\r\ndealer tickled the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s fancy for driving hard bargains. The\r\nclerks knew her well and called her \xe2\x80\x9cMamma Four Francs,\xe2\x80\x9d because she\r\nalways demanded four francs when they offered three, on bundles no\r\nbigger than two sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of butter.\r\n\r\nAt the start, Gervaise took advantage of good weeks to get things back\r\nfrom the pawn-shops, only to put them back again the next week. Later\r\nshe let things go altogether, selling her pawn tickets for cash.\r\n\r\nOne thing alone gave Gervaise a pang\xe2\x80\x94it was having to pawn her clock to\r\npay an acceptance for twenty francs to a bailiff who came to seize her\r\ngoods. Until then, she had sworn rather to die of hunger than to part\r\nwith her clock. When mother Coupeau carried it away in a little\r\nbonnet-box, she sunk on to a chair, without a particle of strength left\r\nin her arms, her eyes full of tears, as though a fortune was being torn\r\nfrom her. But when mother Coupeau reappeared with twenty-five francs,\r\nthe unexpected loan, the five francs profit consoled her; she at once\r\nsent the old woman out again for four sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of brandy in a glass,\r\njust to toast the five-franc piece.\r\n\r\nThe two of them would often have a drop together, when they were on\r\ngood terms with each other. Mother Coupeau was very successful at\r\nbringing back a full glass hidden in her apron pocket without spilling\r\na drop. Well, the neighbors didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to know, did they. But the\r\nneighbors knew perfectly well. This turned the neighborhood even more\r\nagainst Gervaise. She was devouring everything; a few more mouthfuls\r\nand the place would be swept clean.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this general demolishment, Coupeau continued to\r\nprosper. The confounded tippler was as well as well could be. The sour\r\nwine and the \xe2\x80\x9cvitriol\xe2\x80\x9d positively fattened him. He ate a great deal,\r\nand laughed at that stick Lorilleux, who accused drink of killing\r\npeople, and answered him by slapping himself on the stomach, the skin\r\nof which was so stretched by the fat that it resembled the skin of a\r\ndrum. He would play him a tune on it, the glutton\xe2\x80\x99s vespers, with rolls\r\nand beats loud enough to have made a quack\xe2\x80\x99s fortune. Lorilleux,\r\nannoyed at not having any fat himself, said that it was soft and\r\nunhealthy. Coupeau ignored him and went on drinking more and more,\r\nsaying it was for his health\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nHis hair was beginning to turn grey and his face to take on the\r\ndrunkard\xe2\x80\x99s hue of purplish wine. He continued to act like a mischievous\r\nchild. Well, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his concern if there was nothing about the place\r\nto eat. When he went for weeks without work he became even more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nStill, he was always giving Lantier friendly slaps on the back. People\r\nswore he had no suspicion at all. Surely something terrible would\r\nhappen if he ever found out. Madame Lerat shook her head at this. His\r\nsister said she had known of husbands who didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind at all.\r\n\r\nLantier wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wasting away either. He took great care of himself,\r\nmeasuring his stomach by the waist-band of his trousers, with the\r\nconstant dread of having to loosen the buckle or draw it tighter; for\r\nhe considered himself just right, and out of coquetry neither desired\r\nto grow fatter nor thinner. That made him hard to please in the matter\r\nof food, for he regarded every dish from the point of view of keeping\r\nhis waist as it was. Even when there was not a sou in the house, he\r\nrequired eggs, cutlets, light and nourishing things. Since he was\r\nsharing the lady of the house, he considered himself to have a half\r\ninterest in everything and would pocket any franc pieces he saw lying\r\nabout. He kept Gervaise running here and there and seemed more at home\r\nthan Coupeau. Nana was his favorite because he adored pretty little\r\ngirls, but he paid less and less attention to Etienne, since boys,\r\naccording to him, ought to know how to take care of themselves. If\r\nanyone came to see Coupeau while he was out, Lantier, in shirt sleeves\r\nand slippers, would come out of the back room with the bored expression\r\nof a husband who has been disturbed, saying he would answer for Coupeau\r\nas it was all the same.\r\n\r\nBetween these two gentlemen, Gervaise had nothing to laugh about. She\r\nhad nothing to complain of as regards her health, thank goodness! She\r\nwas growing too fat. But two men to coddle was often more than she\r\ncould manage. Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ one husband is already too much for a\r\nwoman! The worst was that they got on very well together, the rogues.\r\nThey never quarreled; they would chuckle in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces, as they\r\nsat of an evening after dinner, their elbows on the table; they would\r\nrub up against one another all the live-long day, like cats which seek\r\nand cultivate their pleasure. The days when they came home in a rage,\r\nit was on her that they vented it. Go it! hammer away at the animal!\r\nShe had a good back; it made them all the better friends when they\r\nyelled together. And it never did for her to give them tit-for-tat. In\r\nthe beginning, whenever one of them yelled at her, she would appeal to\r\nthe other, but this seldom worked. Coupeau had a foul mouth and called\r\nher horrible things. Lantier chose his insults carefully, but they\r\noften hurt her even more.\r\n\r\nBut one can get used to anything. Soon their nasty remarks and all the\r\nwrongs done her by these two men slid off her smooth skin like water\r\noff a duck\xe2\x80\x99s back. It was even easier to have them angry, because when\r\nthey were in good moods they bothered her too much, never giving her\r\ntime to get a bonnet ironed.\r\n\r\nYes, Coupeau and Lantier were wearing her out. The zinc-worker, sure\r\nenough, lacked education; but the hatter had too much, or at least he\r\nhad education in the same way that dirty people have a white shirt,\r\nwith uncleanliness underneath it. One night, she dreamt that she was on\r\nthe edge of a wall; Coupeau was knocking her into it with a blow of his\r\nfist, whilst Lantier was tickling her in the ribs to make her fall\r\nquicker. Well! That resembled her life. It was no surprise if she was\r\nbecoming slipshod. The neighbors weren\xe2\x80\x99t fair in blaming her for the\r\nfrightful habits she had fallen into. Sometimes a cold shiver ran\r\nthrough her, but things could have been worse, so she tried to make the\r\nbest of it. Once she had seen a play in which the wife detested her\r\nhusband and poisoned him for the sake of her lover. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it more\r\nsensible for the three of them to live together in peace? In spite of\r\nher debts and poverty she thought she was quite happy and could live in\r\npeace if only Coupeau and Lantier would stop yelling at her so much.\r\n\r\nTowards the autumn, unfortunately, things became worse. Lantier\r\npretended he was getting thinner, and pulled a longer face over the\r\nmatter every day. He grumbled at everything, sniffed at the dishes of\r\npotatoes\xe2\x80\x94a mess he could not eat, he would say, without having the\r\ncolic. The least jangling now turned to quarrels, in which they accused\r\none another of being the cause of all their troubles, and it was a\r\ndevil of a job to restore harmony before they all retired for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nLantier sensed a crisis coming and it exasperated him to realise that\r\nthis place was already so thoroughly cleaned out that he could see the\r\nday coming when he\xe2\x80\x99d have to take his hat and seek elsewhere for his\r\nbed and board. He had become accustomed to this little paradise where\r\nhe was nicely treated by everybody. He should have blamed himself for\r\neating himself out of house and home, but instead he blamed the\r\nCoupeaus for letting themselves be ruined in less than two years. He\r\nthought Gervaise was too extravagant. What was going to happen to them\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nOne evening in December they had no dinner at all. There was not a\r\nradish left. Lantier, who was very glum, went out early, wandering\r\nabout in search of some other den where the smell of the kitchen would\r\nbring a smile to one\xe2\x80\x99s face. He would now remain for hours beside the\r\nstove wrapt in thought. Then, suddenly, he began to evince a great\r\nfriendship for the Poissons. He no longer teased the policeman and even\r\nwent so far as to concede that the Emperor might not be such a bad\r\nfellow after all. He seemed to especially admire Virginie. No doubt he\r\nwas hoping to board with them. Virginie having acquainted him with her\r\ndesire to set up in some sort of business, he agreed with everything\r\nshe said, and declared that her idea was a most brilliant one. She was\r\njust the person for trade\xe2\x80\x94tall, engaging and active. Oh! she would make\r\nas much as she liked. The capital had been available for some time,\r\nthanks to an inheritance from an aunt. Lantier told her of all the\r\nshopkeepers who were making fortunes. The time was right for it; you\r\ncould sell anything these days. Virginie, however, hesitated; she was\r\nlooking for a shop that was to be let, she did not wish to leave the\r\nneighborhood. Then Lantier would take her into corners and converse\r\nwith her in an undertone for ten minutes at a time. He seemed to be\r\nurging her to do something in spite of herself; and she no longer said\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d but appeared to authorize him to act. It was as a secret between\r\nthem, with winks and words rapidly exchanged, some mysterious\r\nunderstanding which betrayed itself even in their handshakings.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the hatter would covertly watch the Coupeaus whilst\r\neating their dry bread, and becoming very talkative again, would deafen\r\nthem with his continual jeremiads. All day long Gervaise moved in the\r\nmidst of that poverty which he so obligingly spread out. _Mon Dieu!_ he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of himself; he would go on starving with his friends as\r\nlong as they liked. But look at it with common sense. They owed at\r\nleast five hundred francs in the neighborhood. Besides which, they were\r\ntwo quarters\xe2\x80\x99 rent behind with the rent, which meant another two\r\nhundred and fifty francs; the landlord, Monsieur Marescot, even spoke\r\nof having them evicted if they did not pay him by the first of January.\r\nFinally the pawn-place had absorbed everything, one could not have got\r\ntogether three francs\xe2\x80\x99 worth of odds and ends, the clearance had been\r\nso complete; the nails remained in the walls and that was all and\r\nperhaps there were two pounds of them at three sous the pound.\r\nGervaise, thoroughly entangled in it all, her nerves quite upset by\r\nthis calculation, would fly into a passion and bang her fists down upon\r\nthe table or else she would end by bursting into tears like a fool. One\r\nnight she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be off to-morrow! I prefer to put the key under the door and to\r\nsleep on the pavement rather than continue to live in such frights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be wiser,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier slyly, \xe2\x80\x9cto get rid of the lease if\r\nyou could find someone to take it. When you are both decided to give up\r\nthe shop\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him more violently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once, at once! Ah! it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good riddance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the hatter became very practical. On giving up the lease one would\r\nno doubt get the new tenant to be responsible for the two overdue\r\nquarters. And he ventured to mention the Poissons, he reminded them\r\nthat Virginie was looking for a shop; theirs would perhaps suit her. He\r\nremembered that he had heard her say she longed for one just like it.\r\nBut when Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned the laundress suddenly regained\r\nher composure. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how things go along. When you\xe2\x80\x99re angry you\r\nalways talk of quitting, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so easy when you just stop to\r\nthink about it.\r\n\r\nDuring the following days it was in vain that Lantier harped upon the\r\nsubject. Gervaise replied that she had seen herself worse off and had\r\npulled through. How would she be better off when she no longer had her\r\nshop? That would not put bread into their mouths. She would, on the\r\ncontrary, engage some fresh workwomen and work up a fresh connection.\r\n\r\nLantier made the mistake of mentioning Virginie again. This stirred\r\nGervaise into furious obstinacy. No! Never! She had always had her\r\nsuspicions of what was in Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s heart. Virginie only wanted to\r\nhumiliate her. She would rather turn it over to the first woman to come\r\nin from the street than to that hypocrite who had been waiting for\r\nyears to see her fail. Yes, Virginie still had in mind that fight in\r\nthe wash-house. Well, she\xe2\x80\x99d be wiser to forget about it, unless she\r\nwanted another one now.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this flow of angry retorts, Lantier began by attacking\r\nGervaise. He called her stupid and stuck-up. He even went so far as to\r\nabuse Coupeau, accusing him of not knowing how to make his wife respect\r\nhis friend. Then, realising that passion would compromise everything,\r\nhe swore that he would never again interest himself in the affairs of\r\nother people, for one always got more kicks than thanks; and indeed he\r\nappeared to have given up all idea of talking them into parting with\r\nthe lease, but he was really watching for a favorable opportunity of\r\nbroaching the subject again and of bringing the laundress round to his\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nJanuary had now arrived; the weather was wretched, both damp and cold.\r\nMother Coupeau, who had coughed and choked all through December, was\r\nobliged to take to her bed after Twelfth-night. It was her annuity,\r\nwhich she expected every winter. This winter though, those around her\r\nsaid she\xe2\x80\x99d never come out of her bedroom except feet first. Indeed, her\r\ngaspings sounded like a death rattle. She was still fat, but one eye\r\nwas blind and one side of her face was twisted. The doctor made one\r\ncall and didn\xe2\x80\x99t return again. They kept giving her tisanes and going to\r\ncheck on her every hour. She could no longer speak because her\r\nbreathing was so difficult.\r\n\r\nOne Monday evening, Coupeau came home totally drunk. Ever since his\r\nmother was in danger, he had lived in a continual state of deep\r\nemotion. When he was in bed, snoring soundly, Gervaise walked about the\r\nplace for a while. She was in the habit of watching over mother Coupeau\r\nduring a part of the night. Nana had showed herself very brave, always\r\nsleeping beside the old woman, and saying that if she heard her dying,\r\nshe would wake everyone. Since the invalid seemed to be sleeping\r\npeacefully this night, Gervaise finally yielded to the appeals of\r\nLantier to come into his room for a little rest. They only kept a\r\ncandle alight, standing on the ground behind the wardrobe. But towards\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock Gervaise abruptly jumped out of bed, shivering and\r\noppressed with anguish. She thought she had felt a cold breath pass\r\nover her body. The morsel of candle had burnt out; she tied on her\r\npetticoats in the dark, all bewildered, and with feverish hands. It was\r\nnot till she got into the little room, after knocking up against the\r\nfurniture, that she was able to light a small lamp. In the midst of the\r\noppressive silence of night, the zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s snores alone sounded as\r\ntwo grave notes. Nana, stretched on her back, was breathing gently\r\nbetween her pouting lips. And Gervaise, holding down the lamp which\r\ncaused big shadows to dance about the room, cast the light on mother\r\nCoupeau\xe2\x80\x99s face, and beheld it all white, the head lying on the\r\nshoulder, the eyes wide open. Mother Coupeau was dead.\r\n\r\nGently, without uttering a cry, icy cold yet prudent, the laundress\r\nreturned to Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s room. He had gone to sleep again. She bent over\r\nhim and murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, it\xe2\x80\x99s all over, she\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeavy with sleep, only half awake, he grunted at first:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, get into bed. We can\xe2\x80\x99t do her any good if she\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he raised himself on his elbow and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly three o\xe2\x80\x99clock! Get into bed quick. You\xe2\x80\x99ll catch cold. When it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaylight, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she did not listen to him, she dressed herself completely. Bundling\r\nhimself in the blankets, Lantier muttered about how stubborn women\r\nwere. What was the hurry to announce a death in the house? He was\r\nirritated at having his sleep spoiled by such gloomy matters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gervaise had moved her things back into her own room. Then\r\nshe felt free to sit down and cry, no longer fearful of being caught in\r\nLantier\xe2\x80\x99s room. She had been fond of mother Coupeau and felt a deep\r\nsorrow at her loss. She sat, crying by herself, her sobs loud in the\r\nsilence, but Coupeau never stirred. She had spoken to him and even\r\nshaken him and finally decided to let him sleep. He would be more of a\r\nnuisance if he woke up.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the body, she found Nana sitting up in bed rubbing her\r\neyes. The child understood, and with her vicious urchin\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity,\r\nstretched out her neck to get a better view of her grandmother; she\r\nsaid nothing but she trembled slightly, surprised and satisfied in the\r\npresence of this death which she had been promising herself for two\r\ndays past, like some nasty thing hidden away and forbidden to children;\r\nand her young cat-like eyes dilated before that white face all\r\nemaciated at the last gasp by the passion of life, she felt that\r\ntingling in her back which she felt behind the glass door when she\r\ncrept there to spy on what was no concern of chits like her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t remain\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe regretfully slid out of bed, turning her head round and not taking\r\nher eyes off the corpse. Gervaise was much worried about her, not\r\nknowing where to put her till day-time. She was about to tell her to\r\ndress herself, when Lantier, in his trousers and slippers, rejoined\r\nher. He could not get to sleep again, and was rather ashamed of his\r\nbehavior. Then everything was arranged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can sleep in my bed,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana looked at her mother and Lantier with her big, clear eyes and put\r\non her stupid air, the same as on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s day when anyone made her a\r\npresent of a box of chocolate candy. And there was certainly no need\r\nfor them to hurry her. She trotted off in her night-gown, her bare feet\r\nscarcely touching the tiled floor; she glided like a snake into the\r\nbed, which was still quite warm, and she lay stretched out and buried\r\nin it, her slim body scarcely raising the counterpane. Each time her\r\nmother entered the room she beheld her with her eyes sparkling in her\r\nmotionless face\xe2\x80\x94not sleeping, not moving, very red with excitement, and\r\nappearing to reflect on her own affairs.\r\n\r\nLantier assisted Gervaise in dressing mother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x94and it was not an\r\neasy matter, for the body was heavy. One would never have thought that\r\nthat old woman was so fat and so white. They put on her stockings, a\r\nwhite petticoat, a short linen jacket and a white cap\xe2\x80\x94in short, the\r\nbest of her linen. Coupeau continued snoring, a high note and a low\r\none, the one sharp, the other flat. One could almost have imagined it\r\nto be church music accompanying the Good Friday ceremonies. When the\r\ncorpse was dressed and properly laid out on the bed, Lantier poured\r\nhimself out a glass of wine, for he felt quite upset. Gervaise searched\r\nthe chest of drawers to find a little brass crucifix which she had\r\nbrought from Plassans, but she recollected that mother Coupeau had, in\r\nall probability, sold it herself. They had lighted the stove, and they\r\npassed the rest of the night half asleep on chairs, finishing the\r\nbottle of wine that had been opened, worried and sulking, as though it\r\nwas their own fault.\r\n\r\nTowards seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, before daylight, Coupeau at length awoke. When\r\nhe learnt his loss he at first stood still with dry eyes, stuttering\r\nand vaguely thinking that they were playing him some joke. Then he\r\nthrew himself on the ground and went and knelt beside the corpse. His\r\nkissed it and wept like a child, with such a copious flow of tears that\r\nhe quite wetted the sheet with wiping his cheeks. Gervaise had\r\nrecommenced sobbing, deeply affected by her husband\xe2\x80\x99s grief, and the\r\nbest of friends with him again. Yes, he was better at heart than she\r\nthought he was. Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s despair mingled with a violent pain in his\r\nhead. He passed his fingers through his hair. His mouth was dry, like\r\non the morrow of a booze, and he was still a little drunk in spite of\r\nhis ten hours of sleep. And, clenching his fist, he complained aloud.\r\n_Mon Dieu!_ she was gone now, his poor mother, whom he loved so much!\r\nAh! what a headache he had; it would settle him! It was like a wig of\r\nfire! And now they were tearing out his heart! No, it was not just of\r\nfate thus to set itself against one man!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, cheer up, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier, raising him from the\r\nground; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must pull yourself together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe poured him out a glass of wine, but Coupeau refused to drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got copper in my throat. It\xe2\x80\x99s mamma.\r\nWhen I saw her I got a taste of copper in my mouth. Mamma! _Mon Dieu!_\r\nmamma, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he recommenced crying like a child. Then he drank the glass of\r\nwine, hoping to put out the flame searing his breast. Lantier soon\r\nleft, using the excuse of informing the family and filing the necessary\r\ndeclaration at the town hall. Really though, he felt the need of fresh\r\nair, and so he took his time, smoking cigarettes and enjoying the\r\nmorning air. When he left Madame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s house, he went into a dairy\r\nplace on Les Batignolles for a cup of hot coffee and remained there an\r\nhour, thinking things over.\r\n\r\nTowards nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the family were all united in the shop, the\r\nshutters of which were kept up. Lorilleux did not cry. Moreover he had\r\nsome pressing work to attend to, and he returned almost directly to his\r\nroom, after having stalked about with a face put on for the occasion.\r\nMadame Lorilleux and Madame Lerat embraced the Coupeaus and wiped their\r\neyes, from which a few tears were falling. But Madame Lorilleux, after\r\ngiving a hasty glance round the death chamber, suddenly raised her\r\nvoice to say that it was unheard of, that one never left a lighted lamp\r\nbeside a corpse; there should be a candle, and Nana was sent to\r\npurchase a packet of tall ones. Ah, well! It made one long to die at\r\nClump-clump\xe2\x80\x99s, she laid one out in such a fine fashion! What a fool,\r\nnot even to know what to do with a corpse! Had she then never buried\r\nanyone in her life? Madame Lerat had to go to the neighbors and borrow\r\na crucifix; she brought one back which was too big, a cross of black\r\nwood with a Christ in painted cardboard fastened to it, which covered\r\nthe whole of mother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s chest, and seemed to crush her under its\r\nweight. Then they tried to obtain some holy water, but no one had any,\r\nand it was again Nana who was sent to the church to bring some back in\r\na bottle. In practically no time the tiny room presented quite another\r\nappearance; on a little table a candle was burning beside a glass full\r\nof holy water into which a sprig of boxwood was dipped. Now, if anyone\r\ncame, it would at least look decent. And they arranged the chairs in a\r\ncircle in the shop for receiving people.\r\n\r\nLantier only returned at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He had been to the\r\nundertaker\xe2\x80\x99s for information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coffin is twelve francs,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you desire a mass, it will\r\nbe ten francs more. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the hearse, which is charged for\r\naccording to the ornaments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s quite unnecessary to be fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Madame Lorilleux,\r\nraising her head in a surprised and anxious manner. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t bring\r\nmamma to life again, can we? One must do according to one\xe2\x80\x99s means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I think,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the hatter. \xe2\x80\x9cI merely\r\nasked the prices to guide you. Tell me what you desire; and after lunch\r\nI will give the orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were talking in lowered voices. Only a dim light came into the\r\nroom through the cracks in the shutters. The door to the little room\r\nstood half open, and from it came the deep silence of death. Children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaughter echoed in the courtyard. Suddenly they heard the voice of\r\nNana, who had escaped from the Boches to whom she had been sent. She\r\nwas giving commands in her shrill voice and the children were singing a\r\nsong about a donkey.\r\n\r\nGervaise waited until it was quiet to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not rich certainly; but all the same we wish to act decently. If\r\nmother Coupeau has left us nothing, it\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for pitching her\r\ninto the ground like a dog. No; we must have a mass, and a hearse with\r\na few ornaments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will pay for them?\xe2\x80\x9d violently inquired Madame Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nwe, who lost some money last week; and you either, as you\xe2\x80\x99re stumped.\r\nAh! you ought, however, to see where it has led you, this trying to\r\nimpress people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau, when consulted, mumbled something with a gesture of profound\r\nindifference, and then fell asleep again on his chair. Madame Lerat\r\nsaid that she would pay her share. She was of Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, they\r\nshould do things decently. Then the two of them fell to making\r\ncalculations on a piece of paper: in all, it would amount to about\r\nninety francs, because they decided, after a long discussion, to have a\r\nhearse ornamented with a narrow scallop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re three,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the laundress. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give thirty francs each.\r\nIt won\xe2\x80\x99t ruin us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Madame Lorilleux broke out in a fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I refuse, yes, I refuse! It\xe2\x80\x99s not for the thirty francs. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive a hundred thousand, if I had them, and if it would bring mamma to\r\nlife again. Only, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like vain people. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a shop, you only\r\ndream of showing off before the neighborhood. We don\xe2\x80\x99t fall in with it,\r\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t. We don\xe2\x80\x99t try to make ourselves out what we are not. Oh! you\r\ncan manage it to please yourself. Put plumes on the hearse if it amuses\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one asks you for anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise ended by answering. \xe2\x80\x9cEven\r\nthough I should have to sell myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not have anything to reproach\r\nmyself with. I\xe2\x80\x99ve fed mother Coupeau without your help, and I can\r\ncertainly bury her without your help also. I already once before gave\r\nyou a bit of my mind; I pick up stray cats, I\xe2\x80\x99m not likely to leave\r\nyour mother in the mire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Madame Lorilleux burst into tears and Lantier had to prevent her\r\nfrom leaving. The argument became so noisy that Madame Lerat felt she\r\nhad to go quietly into the little room and glance tearfully at her dead\r\nmother, as though fearing to find her awake and listening. Just at this\r\nmoment the girls playing in the courtyard, led by Nana, began singing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ how those children grate on one\xe2\x80\x99s nerves with their\r\nsinging!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, all upset and on the point of sobbing with\r\nimpatience and sadness. Turning to the hatter, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo please make them leave off, and send Nana back to the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwith a kick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat and Madame Lorilleux went away to eat lunch, promising to\r\nreturn. The Coupeaus sat down to eat a bite without much appetite,\r\nfeeling hesitant about even raising a fork. After lunch Lantier went to\r\nthe undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s again with the ninety francs. Thirty had come from\r\nMadame Lerat and Gervaise had run, with her hair all loose, to borrow\r\nsixty francs from Goujet.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the neighbors called in the afternoon, mainly out of\r\ncuriosity. They went into the little room to make the sign of the cross\r\nand sprinkle some holy water with the boxwood sprig. Then they sat in\r\nthe shop and talked endlessly about the departed. Mademoiselle Remanjou\r\nhad noticed that her right eye was still open. Madame Gaudron\r\nmaintained that she had a fine complexion for her age. Madame\r\nFauconnier kept repeating that she had seen her having coffee only\r\nthree days earlier.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the Coupeaus were beginning to have had enough of it.\r\nIt was too great an affliction for a family to have to keep a corpse so\r\nlong a time. The government ought to have made a new law on the\r\nsubject. All through another evening, another night, and another\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x94no! it would never come to an end. When one no longer weeps,\r\ngrief turns to irritation; is it not so? One would end by misbehaving\r\noneself. Mother Coupeau, dumb and stiff in the depths of the narrow\r\nchamber, was spreading more and more over the lodging and becoming\r\nheavy enough to crush the people in it. And the family, in spite of\r\nitself, gradually fell into the ordinary mode of life, and lost some\r\nportion of its respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have a mouthful with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise to Madame Lerat and\r\nMadame Lorilleux, when they returned. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re too sad; we must keep\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laid the cloth on the work-table. Each one, on seeing the plates,\r\nthought of the feastings they had had on it. Lantier had returned.\r\nLorilleux came down. A pastry-cook had just brought a meat pie, for the\r\nlaundress was too upset to attend to any cooking. As they were taking\r\ntheir seats, Boche came to say that Monsieur Marescot asked to be\r\nadmitted, and the landlord appeared, looking very grave, and wearing a\r\nbroad decoration on his frock-coat. He bowed in silence and went\r\nstraight to the little room, where he knelt down. All the family,\r\nleaving the table, stood up, greatly impressed. Monsieur Marescot,\r\nhaving finished his devotions, passed into the shop and said to the\r\nCoupeaus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come for the two quarters\xe2\x80\x99 rent that\xe2\x80\x99s overdue. Are you\r\nprepared to pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, not quite,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Gervaise, greatly put out at hearing\r\nthis mentioned before the Lorilleuxs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, with the misfortune\r\nwhich has fallen upon us\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, but everyone has their troubles,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the landlord,\r\nspreading out his immense fingers, which indicated the former workman.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, but I cannot wait any longer. If I am not paid by the\r\nmorning after to-morrow, I shall be obliged to have you put out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, struck dumb, imploringly clasped her hands, her eyes full of\r\ntears. With an energetic shake of his big bony head, he gave her to\r\nunderstand that supplications were useless. Besides, the respect due to\r\nthe dead forbade all discussion. He discreetly retired, walking\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand pardons for having disturbed you,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nmorning after to-morrow; do not forget.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as on withdrawing he again passed before the little room, he\r\nsaluted the corpse a last time through the wide open door by devoutly\r\nbending his knee.\r\n\r\nThey began eating and gobbled the food down very quickly, so as not to\r\nseem to be enjoying it, only slowing down when they reached the\r\ndessert. Occasionally Gervaise or one of the sisters would get up,\r\nstill holding her napkin, to look into the small room. They made plenty\r\nof strong coffee to keep them awake through the night. The Poissons\r\narrived about eight and were invited for coffee.\r\n\r\nThen Lantier, who had been watching Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s face, seemed to seize an\r\nopportunity that he had been waiting for ever since the morning. In\r\nspeaking of the indecency of landlords who entered houses of mourning\r\nto demand their money, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a Jesuit, the beast, with his air of officiating at a mass! But\r\nin your place, I\xe2\x80\x99d just chuck up the shop altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, quite worn out and feeling weak and nervous, gave way and\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall certainly not wait for the bailiffs. Ah! it\xe2\x80\x99s more than I\r\ncan bear\xe2\x80\x94more than I can bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lorilleuxs, delighted at the idea that Clump-clump would no longer\r\nhave a shop, approved the plan immensely. One could hardly conceive the\r\ngreat cost a shop was. If she only earned three francs working for\r\nothers she at least had no expenses; she did not risk losing large sums\r\nof money. They repeated this argument to Coupeau, urging him on; he\r\ndrank a great deal and remained in a continuous fit of sensibility,\r\nweeping all day by himself in his plate. As the laundress seemed to be\r\nallowing herself to be convinced, Lantier looked at the Poissons and\r\nwinked. And tall Virginie intervened, making herself most amiable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, we might arrange the matter between us. I would relieve you\r\nof the rest of the lease and settle your matter with the landlord. In\r\nshort, you would not be worried nearly so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Gervaise, shaking herself as though she felt a\r\nshudder pass over her. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll work; I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my two arms, thank heaven!\r\nto help me out of my difficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can talk about it some other time,\xe2\x80\x9d the hatter hastened to put in.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely the thing to do so this evening. Some other time\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nmorning for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Madame Lerat, who had gone into the little room,\r\nuttered a faint cry. She had had a fright because she had found the\r\ncandle burnt out. They all busied themselves in lighting another; they\r\nshook their heads, saying that it was not a good sign when the light\r\nwent out beside a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe wake commenced. Coupeau had gone to lie down, not to sleep, said\r\nhe, but to think; and five minutes afterwards he was snoring. When they\r\nsent Nana off to sleep at the Boches\xe2\x80\x99 she cried; she had been looking\r\nforward ever since the morning to being nice and warm in her good\r\nfriend Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s big bed. The Poissons stayed till midnight. Some hot\r\nwine had been made in a salad-bowl because the coffee affected the\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 nerves too much. The conversation became tenderly effusive.\r\nVirginie talked of the country: she would like to be buried at the\r\ncorner of a wood with wild flowers on her grave. Madame Lerat had\r\nalready put by in her wardrobe the sheet for her shroud, and she kept\r\nit perfumed with a bunch of lavender; she wished always to have a nice\r\nsmell under her nose when she would be eating the dandelions by the\r\nroots. Then, with no sort of transition, the policeman related that he\r\nhad arrested a fine girl that morning who had been stealing from a\r\npork-butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop; on undressing her at the commissary of police\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthey had found ten sausages hanging round her body. And Madame\r\nLorilleux having remarked, with a look of disgust, that she would not\r\neat any of those sausages, the party burst into a gentle laugh. The\r\nwake became livelier, though not ceasing to preserve appearances.\r\n\r\nBut just as they were finishing the hot wine a peculiar noise, a dull\r\ntrickling sound, issued from the little room. All raised their heads\r\nand looked at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier quietly, lowering his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nemptying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe explanation caused the others to nod their heads in a reassured\r\nway, and they replaced their glasses on the table.\r\n\r\nWhen the Poissons left for home, Lantier left also, saying he would\r\nsleep with a friend and leave his bed for the ladies in case they\r\nwanted to take turns napping. Lorilleux went upstairs to bed. Gervaise\r\nand the two sisters arranged themselves by the stove where they huddled\r\ntogether close to the warmth, talking quietly. Coupeau was still\r\nsnoring.\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux was complaining that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a black dress and\r\nasked Gervaise about the black skirt they had given mother Coupeau on\r\nher saint\xe2\x80\x99s day. Gervaise went to look for it. Madame Lorilleux then\r\nwanted some of the old linen and mentioned the bed, the wardrobe, and\r\nthe two chairs as she looked around for other odds and ends. Madame\r\nLerat had to serve as peace maker when a quarrel nearly broke out. She\r\npointed out that as the Coupeaus had cared for their mother, they\r\ndeserved to keep the few things she had left. Soon they were all dozing\r\naround the stove.\r\n\r\nThe night seemed terribly long to them. Now and again they shook\r\nthemselves, drank some coffee and stretched their necks in the\r\ndirection of the little room, where the candle, which was not to be\r\nsnuffed, was burning with a dull red flame, flickering the more because\r\nof the black soot on the wick. Towards morning, they shivered, in spite\r\nof the great heat of the stove. Anguish, and the fatigue of having\r\ntalked too much was stifling them, whilst their mouths were parched,\r\nand their eyes ached. Madame Lerat threw herself on Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and\r\nsnored as loud as a man; whilst the other two, their heads falling\r\nforward, and almost touching their knees, slept before the fire. At\r\ndaybreak, a shudder awoke them. Mother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s candle had again gone\r\nout; and as, in the obscurity, the dull trickling sound recommenced,\r\nMadame Lorilleux gave the explanation of it anew in a loud voice, so as\r\nto reassure herself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s emptying,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she, lighting another candle.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was to take place at half-past ten. A nice morning to add\r\nto the night and the day before! Gervaise, though without a sou, said\r\nshe would have given a hundred francs to anybody who would have come\r\nand taken mother Coupeau away three hours sooner. No, one may love\r\npeople, but they are too great a weight when they are dead; and the\r\nmore one has loved them, the sooner one would like to be rid of their\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nThe morning of a funeral is, fortunately, full of diversions. One has\r\nall sorts of preparations to make. To begin with, they lunched. Then it\r\nhappened to be old Bazouge, the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helper, who lived on the\r\nsixth floor, who brought the coffin and the sack of bran. He was never\r\nsober, the worthy fellow. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that day, he was still\r\nlively from the booze of the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is for here, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\nAnd he laid down the coffin, which creaked like a new box. But as he\r\nwas throwing the sack of bran on one side, he stood with a look of\r\namazement in his eyes, his mouth opened wide, on beholding Gervaise\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg pardon, excuse me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered he. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told\r\nit was for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had already taken up the sack again, and the laundress was obliged\r\nto call to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it alone, it\xe2\x80\x99s for here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! _Mon Dieu!_ Now I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed he, slapping his thigh.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for the old lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had turned quite pale. Old Bazouge had brought the coffin for\r\nher. By way of apology, he tried to be gallant, and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not to blame, am I? It was said yesterday that someone on the\r\nground floor had passed away. Then I thought\xe2\x80\x94you know, in our business,\r\nthese things enter by one ear and go out by the other. All the same, my\r\ncompliments to you. As late as possible, eh? That\xe2\x80\x99s best, though life\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t always amusing; ah! no, by no means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Gervaise listened to him, she draw back, afraid he would grab her\r\nand take her away in the box. She remembered the time before, when he\r\nhad told her he knew of women who would thank him to come and get them.\r\nWell, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready yet. _Mon Dieu!_ The thought sent chills down\r\nher spine. Her life may have been bitter, but she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to give\r\nit up yet. No, she would starve for years first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s abominably drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, with an air of disgust mingled\r\nwith dread. \xe2\x80\x9cThey at least oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to send us tipplers. We pay dear\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he became insolent, and jeered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, little woman, it\xe2\x80\x99s only put off until another time. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nentirely at your service, remember! You\xe2\x80\x99ve only to make me a sign. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthe ladies\xe2\x80\x99 consoler. And don\xe2\x80\x99t spit on old Bazouge, because he\xe2\x80\x99s held\r\nin his arms finer ones than you, who let themselves be tucked in\r\nwithout a murmur, very pleased to continue their by-by in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, old Bazouge!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorilleux severely, having\r\nhastened to the spot on hearing the noise, \xe2\x80\x9csuch jokes are highly\r\nimproper. If we complained about you, you would get the sack. Come, be\r\noff, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve no respect for principles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBazouge moved away, but one could hear him stuttering as he dragged\r\nalong the pavement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! What? Principles! There\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as principles, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno such thing as principles\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s only common decency!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck. The hearse was late. There were already\r\nseveral people in the shop, friends and neighbors\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Madinier,\r\nMy-Boots, Madame Gaudron, Mademoiselle Remanjou; and every minute, a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s or a woman\xe2\x80\x99s head was thrust out of the gaping opening of the\r\ndoor between the closed shutters, to see if that creeping hearse was in\r\nsight. The family, all together in the back room, was shaking hands.\r\nShort pauses occurred interrupted by rapid whisperings, a tiresome and\r\nfeverish waiting with sudden rushes of skirts\xe2\x80\x94Madame Lorilleux who had\r\nforgotten her handkerchief, or else Madame Lerat who was trying to\r\nborrow a prayer-book. Everyone, on arriving, beheld the open coffin in\r\nthe centre of the little room before the bed; and in spite of oneself,\r\neach stood covertly studying it, calculating that plump mother Coupeau\r\nwould never fit into it. They all looked at each other with this\r\nthought in their eyes, though without communicating it. But there was a\r\nslight pushing at the front door. Monsieur Madinier, extending his\r\narms, came and said in a low grave voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not the hearse though. Four helpers entered hastily in single\r\nfile, with their red faces, their hands all lumpy like persons in the\r\nhabit of moving heavy things, and their rusty black clothes worn and\r\nfrayed from constant rubbing against coffins. Old Bazouge walked first,\r\nvery drunk and very proper. As soon as he was at work he found his\r\nequilibrium. They did not utter a word, but slightly bowed their heads,\r\nalready weighing mother Coupeau with a glance. And they did not dawdle;\r\nthe poor old woman was packed in, in the time one takes to sneeze. A\r\nyoung fellow with a squint, the smallest of the men, poured the bran\r\ninto the coffin and spread it out. The tall and thin one spread the\r\nwinding sheet over the bran. Then, two at the feet and two at the head,\r\nall four took hold of the body and lifted it. Mother Coupeau was in the\r\nbox, but it was a tight fit. She touched on every side.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helpers were now standing up and waiting; the little\r\none with the squint took the coffin lid, by way of inviting the family\r\nto bid their last farewell, whilst Bazouge had filled his mouth with\r\nnails and was holding the hammer in readiness. Then Coupeau, his two\r\nsisters and Gervaise threw themselves on their knees and kissed the\r\nmamma who was going away, weeping bitterly, the hot tears falling on\r\nand streaming down the stiff face now cold as ice. There was a\r\nprolonged sound of sobbing. The lid was placed on, and old Bazouge\r\nknocked the nails in with the style of a packer, two blows for each;\r\nand they none of them listened any longer to their own weeping in that\r\ndin, which resembled the noise of furniture being repaired. It was\r\nover. The time for starting had arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fuss to make at such a time!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lorilleux to her\r\nhusband as she caught sight of the hearse before the door.\r\n\r\nThe hearse was creating quite a revolution in the neighborhood. The\r\ntripe-seller called to the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s men, the little clockmaker came out\r\non to the pavement, the neighbors leant out of their windows; and all\r\nthese people talked about the scallop with its white cotton fringe. Ah!\r\nthe Coupeaus would have done better to have paid their debts. But as\r\nthe Lorilleuxs said, when one is proud it shows itself everywhere and\r\nin spite of everything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s shameful!\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise was saying at the same moment, speaking of\r\nthe chainmaker and his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cTo think that those skinflints have not\r\neven brought a bunch of violets for their mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lorilleuxs, true enough, had come empty-handed. Madame Lerat had\r\ngiven a wreath of artificial flowers. And a wreath of immortelles and a\r\nbouquet bought by the Coupeaus were also placed on the coffin. The\r\nundertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helpers had to give a mighty heave to lift the coffin and\r\ncarry it to the hearse. It was some time before the procession was\r\nformed. Coupeau and Lorilleux, in frock coats and with their hats in\r\ntheir hands, were chief mourners. The first, in his emotion which two\r\nglasses of white wine early in the morning had helped to sustain, clung\r\nto his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s arm, with no strength in his legs, and a\r\nviolent headache. Then followed the other men\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Madinier, very\r\ngrave and all in black; My-Boots, wearing a great-coat over his blouse;\r\nBoche, whose yellow trousers produced the effect of a petard; Lantier,\r\nGaudron, Bibi-the-Smoker, Poisson and others. The ladies came next\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe first row Madame Lorilleux, dragging the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s skirt, which\r\nshe had altered; Madame Lerat, hiding under a shawl her hastily got-up\r\nmourning, a gown with lilac trimmings; and following them, Virginie,\r\nMadame Gaudron, Madame Fauconnier, Mademoiselle Remanjou and the rest.\r\nWhen the hearse started and slowly descended the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or,\r\namidst signs of the cross and heads bared, the four helpers took the\r\nlead, two in front, the two others on the right and left. Gervaise had\r\nremained behind to close the shop. She left Nana with Madame Boche and\r\nran to rejoin the procession, whilst the child, firmly held by the\r\nconcierge under the porch, watched with a deeply interested gaze her\r\ngrandmother disappear at the end of the street in that beautiful\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Gervaise caught up with the procession, Goujet\r\narrived from another direction. He nodded to her so sympathetically\r\nthat she was reminded of how unhappy she was, and began to cry again as\r\nGoujet took his place with the men.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony at the church was soon got through. The mass dragged a\r\nlittle, though, because the priest was very old. My-Boots and\r\nBibi-the-Smoker preferred to remain outside on account of the\r\ncollection. Monsieur Madinier studied the priests all the while, and\r\ncommunicated his observations to Lantier. Those jokers, though so glib\r\nwith their Latin, did not even know a word of what they were saying.\r\nThey buried a person just in the same way that they would have baptized\r\nor married him, without the least feeling in their heart.\r\n\r\nHappily, the cemetery was not far off, the little cemetery of La\r\nChapelle, a bit of a garden which opened on to the Rue Marcadet. The\r\nprocession arrived disbanded, with stampings of feet and everybody\r\ntalking of his own affairs. The hard earth resounded, and many would\r\nhave liked to have moved about to keep themselves warm. The gaping hole\r\nbeside which the coffin was laid was already frozen over, and looked\r\nwhite and stony, like a plaster quarry; and the followers, grouped\r\nround little heaps of gravel, did not find it pleasant standing in such\r\npiercing cold, whilst looking at the hole likewise bored them. At\r\nlength a priest in a surplice came out of a little cottage. He\r\nshivered, and one could see his steaming breath at each _de profundis_\r\nthat he uttered. At the final sign of the cross he bolted off, without\r\nthe least desire to go through the service again. The sexton took his\r\nshovel, but on account of the frost, he was only able to detach large\r\nlumps of earth, which beat a fine tune down below, a regular\r\nbombardment of the coffin, an enfilade of artillery sufficient to make\r\none think the wood was splitting. One may be a cynic; nevertheless that\r\nsort of music soon upsets one\xe2\x80\x99s stomach. The weeping recommenced. They\r\nmoved off, they even got outside, but they still heard the detonations.\r\nMy-Boots, blowing on his fingers, uttered an observation aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tonnerre de Dieu!_ poor mother Coupeau won\xe2\x80\x99t feel very warm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the zinc-worker to the few friends who\r\nremained in the street with the family, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you permit us to offer\r\nyou some refreshments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to a wine shop in the Rue Marcadet, the \xe2\x80\x9cArrival at the\r\nCemetery.\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise, remaining outside, called Goujet, who was moving\r\noff, after again nodding to her. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he accept a glass of wine?\r\nHe was in a hurry; he was going back to the workshop. Then they looked\r\nat each other a moment without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask your pardon for troubling you about the sixty francs,\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nlength murmured the laundress. \xe2\x80\x9cI was half crazy, I thought of you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it; you\xe2\x80\x99re fully forgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the\r\nblacksmith. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know, I am quite at your service if any misfortune\r\nshould overtake you. But don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to mamma, because she has\r\nher ideas, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to cause her annoyance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him. He seemed to her such a good man, and sad-looking,\r\nand so handsome. She was on the verge of accepting his former proposal,\r\nto go away with him and find happiness together somewhere else. Then an\r\nevil thought came to her. It was the idea of borrowing the six months\xe2\x80\x99\r\nback rent from him.\r\n\r\nShe trembled and resumed in a caressing tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re still friends, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head as he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll always be friends. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that, you know, all is over\r\nbetween us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he went off with long strides, leaving Gervaise bewildered,\r\nlistening to his last words which rang in her ears with the clang of a\r\nbig bell. On entering the wine shop, she seemed to hear a hollow voice\r\nwithin her which said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll is over, well! All is over; there is\r\nnothing more for me to do if all is over!\xe2\x80\x9d Sitting down, she swallowed\r\na mouthful of bread and cheese, and emptied a glass full of wine which\r\nshe found before her.\r\n\r\nThe wine shop was a single, long room with a low ceiling occupied by\r\ntwo large tables on which loaves of bread, large chunks of Brie cheese\r\nand bottles of wine were set out. They ate informally, without a\r\ntablecloth. Near the stove at the back the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helpers were\r\nfinishing their lunch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Monsieur Madinier, \xe2\x80\x9cwe each have our time. The\r\nold folks make room for the young ones. Your lodging will seem very\r\nempty to you now when you go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my brother is going to give notice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lorilleux\r\nquickly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat shop\xe2\x80\x99s ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been working upon Coupeau. Everyone was urging him to give up\r\nthe lease. Madame Lerat herself, who had been on very good terms with\r\nLantier and Virginie for some time past, and who was tickled with the\r\nidea that they were a trifle smitten with each other, talked of\r\nbankruptcy and prison, putting on the most terrified airs. And\r\nsuddenly, the zinc-worker, already overdosed with liquor, flew into a\r\npassion, his emotion turned to fury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, poking his nose in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s face; \xe2\x80\x9cI intend that\r\nyou shall listen to me! Your confounded head will always have its own\r\nway. But, this time, I intend to have mine, I warn you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier, \xe2\x80\x9cone never yet brought her to reason by fair\r\nwords; it wants a mallet to drive it into her head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a time they both went on at her. Meanwhile, the Brie was quickly\r\ndisappearing and the wine bottles were pouring like fountains. Gervaise\r\nbegan to weaken under this persistent pounding. She answered nothing,\r\nbut hurried herself, her mouth ever full, as though she had been very\r\nhungry. When they got tired, she gently raised her head and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t care a straw for the shop! I want no\r\nmore of it. Do you understand? It can go to the deuce! All is over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they ordered some more bread and cheese and talked business. The\r\nPoissons took the rest of the lease and agreed to be answerable for the\r\ntwo quarters\xe2\x80\x99 rent overdue. Boche, moreover, pompously agreed to the\r\narrangement in the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s name. He even then and there let a\r\nlodging to the Coupeaus\xe2\x80\x94the vacant one on the sixth floor, in the same\r\npassage as the Lorilleuxs\xe2\x80\x99 apartment. As for Lantier, well! He would\r\nlike to keep his room, if it did not inconvenience the Poissons. The\r\npoliceman bowed; it did not inconvenience him at all; friends always\r\nget on together, in spite of any difference in their political ideas.\r\nAnd Lantier, without mixing himself up any more in the matter, like a\r\nman who has at length settled his little business, helped himself to an\r\nenormous slice of bread and cheese; he leant back in his chair and ate\r\ndevoutly, his blood tingling beneath his skin, his whole body burning\r\nwith a sly joy, and he blinked his eyes to peep first at Gervaise, and\r\nthen at Virginie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! Old Bazouge!\xe2\x80\x9d called Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and have a drink. We\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nproud; we\xe2\x80\x99re all workers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe four undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helpers, who had started to leave, came back to\r\nraise glasses with the group. They thought that the lady had weighed\r\nquite a bit and they had certainly earned a glass of wine. Old Bazouge\r\ngazed steadily at Gervaise without saying a word. It made her feel\r\nuneasy though and she got up and left the men who were beginning to\r\nshow signs of being drunk. Coupeau began to sob again, saying he was\r\nfeeling very sad.\r\n\r\nThat evening when Gervaise found herself at home again, she remained in\r\na stupefied state on a chair. It seemed to her that the rooms were\r\nimmense and deserted. Really, it would be a good riddance. But it was\r\ncertainly not only mother Coupeau that she had left at the bottom of\r\nthe hole in the little garden of the Rue Marcadet. She missed too many\r\nthings, most likely a part of her life, and her shop, and her pride of\r\nbeing an employer, and other feelings besides, which she had buried on\r\nthat day. Yes, the walls were bare, and her heart also; it was a\r\ncomplete clear out, a tumble into the pit. And she felt too tired; she\r\nwould pick herself up again later on if she could.\r\n\r\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when undressing, Nana cried and stamped. She wanted to\r\nsleep in mother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Her mother tried to frighten her; but\r\nthe child was too precocious. Corpses only filled her with a great\r\ncuriosity; so that, for the sake of peace, she was allowed to lie down\r\nin mother Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s place. She liked big beds, the chit; she spread\r\nherself out and rolled about. She slept uncommonly well that night in\r\nthe warm and pleasant feather bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coupeaus\xe2\x80\x99 new lodging was on the sixth floor, staircase B. After\r\npassing Mademoiselle Remanjou\xe2\x80\x99s door, you took the corridor to the\r\nleft, and then turned again further along. The first door was for the\r\napartment of the Bijards. Almost opposite, in an airless corner under a\r\nsmall staircase leading to the roof, was where Pere Bru slept. Two\r\ndoors further was Bazouge\xe2\x80\x99s room and the Coupeaus were opposite him,\r\noverlooking the court, with one room and a closet. There were only two\r\nmore doors along the corridor before reaching that of the Lorilleuxs at\r\nthe far end.\r\n\r\nA room and a closet, no more. The Coupeaus perched there now. And the\r\nroom was scarcely larger than one\xe2\x80\x99s hand. And they had to do everything\r\nin there\xe2\x80\x94eat, sleep, and all the rest. Nana\xe2\x80\x99s bed just squeezed into\r\nthe closet; she had to dress in her father and mother\xe2\x80\x99s room, and her\r\ndoor was kept open at night-time so that she should not be suffocated.\r\nThere was so little space that Gervaise had left many things in the\r\nshop for the Poissons. A bed, a table, and four chairs completely\r\nfilled their new apartment but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the courage to part with\r\nher old bureau and so it blocked off half the window. This made the\r\nroom dark and gloomy, especially since one shutter was stuck shut.\r\nGervaise was now so fat that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t room for her in the limited\r\nwindow space and she had to lean sideways and crane her neck if she\r\nwanted to see the courtyard.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days, the laundress would continually sit down and\r\ncry. It seemed to her too hard, not being able to move about in her\r\nhome, after having been used to so much room. She felt stifled; she\r\nremained at the window for hours, squeezed between the wall and the\r\ndrawers and getting a stiff neck. It was only there that she could\r\nbreathe freely. However, the courtyard inspired rather melancholy\r\nthoughts. Opposite her, on the sunny side, she would see that same\r\nwindow she had dreamed about long ago where the spring brought scarlet\r\nvines. Her own room was on the shady side where pots of mignonette died\r\nwithin a week. Oh, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all the sort of life she had dreamed\r\nof. She had to wallow in filth instead of having flowers all about her.\r\n\r\nOn leaning out one day, Gervaise experienced a peculiar sensation: she\r\nfancied she beheld herself down below, near the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s room under\r\nthe porch, her nose in the air, and examining the house for the first\r\ntime; and this leap thirteen years backwards caused her heart to throb.\r\nThe courtyard was a little dingier and the walls more stained,\r\notherwise it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t changed much. But she herself felt terribly changed\r\nand worn. To begin with, she was no longer below, her face raised to\r\nheaven, feeling content and courageous and aspiring to a handsome\r\nlodging. She was right up under the roof, among the most wretched, in\r\nthe dirtiest hole, the part that never received a ray of sunshine. And\r\nthat explained her tears; she could scarcely feel enchanted with her\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Gervaise had grown somewhat used to it, the early days of\r\nthe little family in their new home did not pass off so badly. The\r\nwinter was almost over, and the trifle of money received for the\r\nfurniture sold to Virginie helped to make things comfortable. Then with\r\nthe fine weather came a piece of luck, Coupeau was engaged to work in\r\nthe country at Etampes; and he was there for nearly three months\r\nwithout once getting drunk, cured for a time by the fresh air. One has\r\nno idea what a quench it is to the tippler\xe2\x80\x99s thirst to leave Paris\r\nwhere the very streets are full of the fumes of wine and brandy. On his\r\nreturn he was as fresh as a rose, and he brought back in his pocket\r\nfour hundred francs with which they paid the two overdue quarters\xe2\x80\x99 rent\r\nat the shop that the Poissons had become answerable for, and also the\r\nmost pressing of their little debts in the neighborhood. Gervaise thus\r\nopened two or three streets through which she had not passed for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nShe had naturally become an ironer again. Madame Fauconnier was quite\r\ngood-hearted if you flattered her a bit, and she was happy to take\r\nGervaise back, even paying her the same three francs a day as her best\r\nworker. This was out of respect for her former status as an employer.\r\nThe household seemed to be getting on well and Gervaise looked forward\r\nto the day when all the debts would be paid. Hard work and economy\r\nwould solve all their money troubles. Unfortunately, she dreamed of\r\nthis in the warm satisfaction of the large sum earned by her husband.\r\nSoon, she said that the good things never lasted and took things as\r\nthey came.\r\n\r\nWhat the Coupeaus most suffered from at that time was seeing the\r\nPoissons installing themselves at their former shop. They were not\r\nnaturally of a particularly jealous disposition, but people aggravated\r\nthem by purposely expressing amazement in their presence at the\r\nembellishments of their successors. The Boches and the Lorilleuxs\r\nespecially, never tired. According to them, no one had ever seen so\r\nbeautiful a shop. They were also continually mentioning the filthy\r\nstate in which the Poissons had found the premises, saying that it had\r\ncost thirty francs for the cleaning alone.\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, Virginie had decided to open a shop\r\nspecializing in candies, chocolate, coffee and tea. Lantier had advised\r\nthis, saying there was much money to be made from such delicacies. The\r\nshop was stylishly painted black with yellow stripes. Three carpenters\r\nworked for eight days on the interior, putting up shelves, display\r\ncases and counters. Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s small inheritance must have been almost\r\ncompletely used, but Virginie was ecstatic. The Lorilleuxs and the\r\nBoches made sure that Gervaise did not miss a single improvement and\r\nchuckled to themselves while watching her expression.\r\n\r\nThere was also a question of a man beneath all this. It was reported\r\nthat Lantier had broken off with Gervaise. The neighborhood declared\r\nthat it was quite right. In short, it gave a moral tone to the street.\r\nAnd all the honor of the separation was accorded to the crafty hatter\r\non whom all the ladies continued to dote. Some said that she was still\r\ncrazy about him and he had to slap her to make her leave him alone. Of\r\ncourse, no one told the actual truth. It was too simple and not\r\ninteresting enough.\r\n\r\nActually Lantier climbed to the sixth floor to see her whenever he felt\r\nthe impulse. Mademoiselle Remanjou had often seen him coming out of the\r\nCoupeaus\xe2\x80\x99 at odd hours.\r\n\r\nThe situation was even more complicated by neighborhood gossip linking\r\nLantier and Virginie. The neighbors were a bit too hasty in this also;\r\nhe had not even reached the stage of buttock-pinching with her. Still,\r\nthe Lorilleuxs delighted in talking sympathetically to Gervaise about\r\nthe affair between Lantier and Virginie. The Boches maintained they had\r\nnever seen a more handsome couple. The odd thing in all this was that\r\nthe Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or seemed to have no objection to this new\r\narrangement which everyone thought was progressing nicely. Those who\r\nhad been so harsh to Gervaise were now quite lenient toward Virginie.\r\n\r\nGervaise had previously heard numerous reports about Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s affairs\r\nwith all sorts of girls on the street and they had bothered her so\r\nlittle that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even felt enough resentment to break off the\r\naffair. However, this new intrigue with Virginie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so easy\r\nto accept because she was sure that the two of them were just out to\r\nspite her. She hid her resentment though to avoid giving any\r\nsatisfaction to her enemies. Mademoiselle Remanjou thought that\r\nGervaise had words with Lantier over this because one afternoon she\r\nheard the sound of a slap. There was certainly a quarrel because\r\nLantier stopped speaking to Gervaise for a couple of weeks, but then he\r\nwas the first one to make up and things seemed to go along the same as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nCoupeau found all this most amusing. The complacent husband who had\r\nbeen blind to his own situation laughed heartily at Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npredicament. Then Coupeau even teased Gervaise. Her lovers always\r\ndropped her. First the blacksmith and now the hatmaker. The trouble was\r\nthat she got involved with undependable trades. She should take up with\r\na mason, a good solid man. He said such things as if he were joking,\r\nbut they upset Gervaise because his small grey eyes seemed to be boring\r\nright into her.\r\n\r\nOn evenings when Coupeau became bored being alone with his wife up in\r\ntheir tiny hole under the roof, he would go down for Lantier and invite\r\nhim up. He thought their dump was too dreary without Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s company\r\nso he patched things up between Gervaise and Lantier whenever they had\r\na falling out.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this Lantier put on the most consequential airs. He\r\nshowed himself both paternal and dignified. On three successive\r\noccasions he had prevented a quarrel between the Coupeaus and the\r\nPoissons. The good understanding between the two families formed a part\r\nof his contentment. Thanks to the tender though firm glances with which\r\nhe watched over Gervaise and Virginie, they always pretended to\r\nentertain a great friendship for each other. He reigned over both\r\nblonde and brunette with the tranquillity of a pasha, and fattened on\r\nhis cunning. The rogue was still digesting the Coupeaus when he already\r\nbegan to devour the Poissons. Oh, it did not inconvenience him much! As\r\nsoon as one shop was swallowed, he started on a second. It was only men\r\nof his sort who ever have any luck.\r\n\r\nIt was in June of that year that Nana was confirmed. She was then\r\nnearly thirteen years old, as tall as an asparagus shoot run to seed,\r\nand had a bold, impudent air about her. The year before she had been\r\nsent away from the catechism class on account of her bad behavior; and\r\nthe priest had only allowed her to join it this time through fear of\r\nlosing her altogether, and of casting one more heathen onto the street.\r\nNana danced for joy as she thought of the white dress. The Lorilleuxs,\r\nbeing godfather and godmother, had promised to provide it, and took\r\ncare to let everyone in the house know of their present. Madame Lerat\r\nwas to give the veil and the cap, Virginie the purse, and Lantier the\r\nprayer-book; so that the Coupeaus looked forward to the ceremony\r\nwithout any great anxiety. Even the Poissons, wishing to give a\r\nhouse-warming, chose this occasion, no doubt on the hatter\xe2\x80\x99s advice.\r\nThey invited the Coupeaus and the Boches, whose little girl was also\r\ngoing to be confirmed. They provided a leg of mutton and trimmings for\r\nthe evening in question.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that on the evening before, Coupeau returned home in a\r\nmost abominable condition, just as Nana was lost in admiration before\r\nthe presents spread out on the top of the chest of drawers. The Paris\r\natmosphere was getting the better of him again; and he fell foul of his\r\nwife and child with drunken arguments and disgusting language which no\r\none should have uttered at such a time. Nana herself was beginning to\r\nget hold of some very bad expressions in the midst of the filthy\r\nconversations she was continually hearing. On the days when there was a\r\nrow, she would often call her mother an old camel and a cow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s my food?\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the zinc-worker. \xe2\x80\x9cI want my soup, you couple\r\nof jades! There\xe2\x80\x99s females for you, always thinking of finery! I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit\r\non the gee-gaws, you know, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get my soup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable when he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gervaise, out of patience;\r\nand turning towards him, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s warming up, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana was being modest, because she thought it nice on such a day. She\r\ncontinued to look at the presents on the chest of drawers, affectedly\r\nlowering her eyelids and pretending not to understand her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnaughty words. But the zinc-worker was an awful plague on the nights\r\nwhen he had had too much. Poking his face right against her neck, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you white dresses! So the finery tickles your fancy. They\r\nexcite your imagination. Just you cut away from there, you ugly little\r\nbrat! Move your hands about, bundle them all into a drawer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana, with bowed head, did not answer a word. She had taken up the\r\nlittle tulle cap and was asking her mother how much it cost. And as\r\nCoupeau thrust out his hand to seize hold of the cap, it was Gervaise\r\nwho pushed him aside exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo leave the child alone! She\xe2\x80\x99s very good, she\xe2\x80\x99s doing no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the zinc-worker let out in real earnest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the viragos! The mother and daughter, they make the pair. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nnice thing to go to church just to leer at the men. Dare to say it\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t true, little slattern! I\xe2\x80\x99ll dress you in a sack, just to disgust\r\nyou, you and your priests. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be taught anything worse\r\nthan you know already. _Mon Dieu!_ Just listen to me, both of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Nana turned round in a fury, whilst Gervaise had to spread out\r\nher arms to protect the things which Coupeau talked of tearing. The\r\nchild looked her father straight in the face; then, forgetting the\r\nmodest bearing inculcated by her confessor, she said, clinching her\r\nteeth: \xe2\x80\x9cPig!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as the zinc-worker had had his soup he went off to sleep. On\r\nthe morrow he awoke in a very good humor. He still felt a little of the\r\nbooze of the day before but only just sufficient to make him amiable.\r\nHe assisted at the dressing of the child, deeply affected by the white\r\ndress and finding that a mere nothing gave the little vermin quite the\r\nlook of a young lady.\r\n\r\nThe two families started off together for the church. Nana and Pauline\r\nwalked first, their prayer-books in their hands and holding down their\r\nveils on account of the wind; they did not speak but were bursting with\r\ndelight at seeing people come to their shop-doors, and they smiled\r\nprimly and devoutly every time they heard anyone say as they passed\r\nthat they looked very nice. Madame Boche and Madame Lorilleux lagged\r\nbehind, because they were interchanging their ideas about Clump-clump,\r\na gobble-all, whose daughter would never have been confirmed if the\r\nrelations had not found everything for her; yes, everything, even a new\r\nchemise, out of respect for the holy altar. Madame Lorilleux was rather\r\nconcerned about the dress, calling Nana a dirty thing every time the\r\nchild got dust on her skirt by brushing against the store fronts.\r\n\r\nAt church Coupeau wept all the time. It was stupid but he could not\r\nhelp it. It affected him to see the priest holding out his arms and all\r\nthe little girls, looking like angels, pass before him, clasping their\r\nhands; and the music of the organ stirred up his stomach and the\r\npleasant smell of the incense forced him to sniff, the same as though\r\nsomeone had thrust a bouquet of flowers into his face. In short he saw\r\neverything cerulean, his heart was touched. Anyway, other sensitive\r\nsouls around him were wetting their handkerchiefs. This was a beautiful\r\nday, the most beautiful of his life. After leaving the church, Coupeau\r\nwent for a drink with Lorilleux, who had remained dry-eyed.\r\n\r\nThat evening the Poissons\xe2\x80\x99 house-warming was very lively. Friendship\r\nreigned without a hitch from one end of the feast to the other. When\r\nbad times arrive one thus comes in for some pleasant evenings, hours\r\nduring which sworn enemies love each other. Lantier, with Gervaise on\r\nhis left and Virginie on his right, was most amiable to both of them,\r\nlavishing little tender caresses like a cock who desires peace in his\r\npoultry-yard. But the queens of the feast were the two little ones,\r\nNana and Pauline, who had been allowed to keep on their things; they\r\nsat bolt upright through fear of spilling anything on their white\r\ndresses and at every mouthful they were told to hold up their chins so\r\nas to swallow cleanly. Nana, greatly bored by all this fuss, ended by\r\nslobbering her wine over the body of her dress, so it was taken off and\r\nthe stains were at once washed out in a glass of water.\r\n\r\nThen at dessert the children\xe2\x80\x99s future careers were gravely discussed.\r\n\r\nMadame Boche had decided that Pauline would enter a shop to learn how\r\nto punch designs on gold and silver. That paid five or six francs a\r\nday. Gervaise didn\xe2\x80\x99t know yet because Nana had never indicated any\r\npreference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lerat, \xe2\x80\x9cI would bring Nana up as an\r\nartificial flower-maker. It is a pleasant and clean employment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlower-makers?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one of them might as well\r\nwalk the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about me?\xe2\x80\x9d objected Madame Lerat, pursing her lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncertainly not very polite. I assure you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t lie down for\r\nanyone who whistles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen all the rest joined together in hushing her. \xe2\x80\x9cMadame Lerat! Oh,\r\nMadame Lerat!\xe2\x80\x9d By side glances they reminded her of the two girls,\r\nfresh from communion, who were burying their noses in their glasses to\r\nkeep from laughing out loud. The men had been very careful, for\r\npropriety\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to use only suitable language, but Madame Lerat\r\nrefused to follow their example. She flattered herself on her command\r\nof language, as she had often been complimented on the way she could\r\nsay anything before children, without any offence to decency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust you listen, there are some very fine women among the\r\nflower-makers!\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re just like other women and they\r\nshow good taste when they choose to commit a sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no dislike for artificial\r\nflower-making. Only it must please Nana, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I care about; one\r\nshould never thwart children on the question of a vocation. Come Nana,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid; tell me now, would you like to make flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child was leaning over her plate gathering up the cake crumbs with\r\nher wet finger, which she afterwards sucked. She did not hurry herself.\r\nShe grinned in her vicious way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes, mamma, I should like to,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended by declaring.\r\n\r\nThen the matter was at once settled. Coupeau was quite willing that\r\nMadame Lerat should take the child with her on the morrow to the place\r\nwhere she worked in the Rue du Caire. And they all talked very gravely\r\nof the duties of life. Boche said that Nana and Pauline were women now\r\nthat they had partaken of communion. Poisson added that for the future\r\nthey ought to know how to cook, mend socks and look after a house.\r\nSomething was even said of their marrying, and of the children they\r\nwould some day have. The youngsters listened, laughing to themselves,\r\nelated by the thought of being women. What pleased them the most was\r\nwhen Lantier teased them, asking if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t already have little\r\nhusbands. Nana eventually admitted that she cared a great deal for\r\nVictor Fauconnier, son of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s employer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lorilleux to the Boches, as they were all\r\nleaving, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s our goddaughter, but as they\xe2\x80\x99re going to put her into\r\nartificial flower-making, we don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to have anything more to do\r\nwith her. Just one more for the boulevards. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be leading them a\r\nmerry chase before six months are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn going up to bed, the Coupeaus agreed that everything had passed off\r\nwell and that the Poissons were not at all bad people. Gervaise even\r\nconsidered the shop was nicely got up. She was surprised to discover\r\nthat it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t pained her at all to spend an evening there. While Nana\r\nwas getting ready for bed she contemplated her white dress and asked\r\nher mother if the young lady on the third floor had had one like it\r\nwhen she was married last month.\r\n\r\nThis was their last happy day. Two years passed by, during which they\r\nsank deeper and deeper. The winters were especially hard for them. If\r\nthey had bread to eat during the fine weather, the rain and cold came\r\naccompanied by famine, by drubbings before the empty cupboard, and by\r\ndinner-hours with nothing to eat in the little Siberia of their larder.\r\nVillainous December brought numbing freezing spells and the black\r\nmisery of cold and dampness.\r\n\r\nThe first winter they occasionally had a fire, choosing to keep warm\r\nrather than to eat. But the second winter, the stove stood mute with\r\nits rust, adding a chill to the room, standing there like a cast-iron\r\ngravestone. And what took the life out of their limbs, what above all\r\nutterly crushed them was the rent. Oh! the January quarter, when there\r\nwas not a radish in the house and old Boche came up with the bill! It\r\nwas like a bitter storm, a regular tempest from the north. Monsieur\r\nMarescot then arrived the following Saturday, wrapped up in a good warm\r\novercoat, his big hands hidden in woolen gloves; and he was for ever\r\ntalking of turning them out, whilst the snow continued to fall outside,\r\nas though it were preparing a bed for them on the pavement with white\r\nsheets. To have paid the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s rent they would have sold their very\r\nflesh. It was the rent which emptied the larder and the stove.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Coupeaus had only themselves to blame. Life may be a hard\r\nfight, but one always pulls through when one is orderly and\r\neconomical\xe2\x80\x94witness the Lorilleuxs, who paid their rent to the day, the\r\nmoney folded up in bits of dirty paper. But they, it is true, led a\r\nlife of starved spiders, which would disgust one with hard work. Nana\r\nas yet earned nothing at flower-making; she even cost a good deal for\r\nher keep. At Madame Fauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s Gervaise was beginning to be looked\r\ndown upon. She was no longer so expert. She bungled her work to such an\r\nextent that the mistress had reduced her wages to two francs a day, the\r\nprice paid to the clumsiest bungler. But she was still proud, reminding\r\neveryone of her former status as boss of her own shop. When Madame\r\nFauconnier hired Madame Putois, Gervaise was so annoyed at having to\r\nwork beside her former employee that she stayed away for two weeks.\r\n\r\nAs for Coupeau, he did perhaps work, but in that case he certainly made\r\na present of his labor to the Government, for since the time he\r\nreturned from Etampes Gervaise had never seen the color of his money.\r\nShe no longer looked in his hands when he came home on paydays. He\r\narrived swinging his arms, his pockets empty, and often without his\r\nhandkerchief; well, yes, he had lost his rag, or else some rascally\r\ncomrade had sneaked it. At first he always fibbed; there was a donation\r\nto charity, or some money slipped through the hole in his pocket, or he\r\npaid off some imaginary debts. Later, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to make up\r\nanything. He had nothing left because it had all gone into his stomach.\r\n\r\nMadame Boche suggested to Gervaise that she go to wait for him at the\r\nshop exit. This rarely worked though, because Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s comrades would\r\nwarn him and the money would disappear into his shoe or someone else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nYes, it was their own fault if every season found them lower and lower.\r\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing one never tells oneself, especially when\r\none is down in the mire. They accused their bad luck; they pretended\r\nthat fate was against them. Their home had become a regular shambles\r\nwhere they wrangled the whole day long. However, they had not yet come\r\nto blows, with the exception of a few impulsive smacks, which somehow\r\nflew about at the height of their quarrels. The saddest part of the\r\nbusiness was that they had opened the cage of affection; all their\r\nbetter feelings had taken flight, like so many canaries. The genial\r\nwarmth of father, mother and child, when united together and wrapped up\r\nin each other, deserted them, and left them shivering, each in his or\r\nher own corner. All three\xe2\x80\x94Coupeau, Gervaise and Nana\xe2\x80\x94were always in the\r\nmost abominable tempers, biting each other\xe2\x80\x99s noses off for nothing at\r\nall, their eyes full of hatred; and it seemed as though something had\r\nbroken the mainspring of the family, the mechanism which, with happy\r\npeople, causes hearts to beat in unison. Ah! it was certain Gervaise\r\nwas no longer moved as she used to be when she saw Coupeau at the edge\r\nof a roof forty or fifty feet above the pavement. She would not have\r\npushed him off herself, but if he had fallen accidentally, in truth it\r\nwould have freed the earth of one who was of but little account. The\r\ndays when they were more especially at enmity she would ask him why he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come back on a stretcher. She was awaiting it. It would be her\r\ngood luck they were bringing back to her. What use was he\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ndrunkard? To make her weep, to devour all she possessed, to drive her\r\nto sin. Well! Men so useless as he should be thrown as quickly as\r\npossible into the hole and the polka of deliverance be danced over\r\nthem. And when the mother said \xe2\x80\x9cKill him!\xe2\x80\x9d the daughter responded\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock him on the head!\xe2\x80\x9d Nana read all of the reports of accidents in\r\nthe newspapers, and made reflections that were unnatural for a girl.\r\nHer father had such good luck an omnibus had knocked him down without\r\neven sobering him. Would the beggar never croak?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her own poverty Gervaise suffered even more because\r\nother families around her were also starving to death. Their corner of\r\nthe tenement housed the most wretched. There was not a family that ate\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nGervaise felt the most pity for Pere Bru in his cubbyhole under the\r\nstaircase where he hibernated. Sometimes he stayed on his bed of straw\r\nwithout moving for days. Even hunger no longer drove him out since\r\nthere was no use taking a walk when no one would invite him to dinner.\r\nWhenever he didn\xe2\x80\x99t show his face for several days, the neighbors would\r\npush open his door to see if his troubles were over. No, he was still\r\nalive, just barely. Even Death seemed to have neglected him. Whenever\r\nGervaise had any bread she gave him the crusts. Even when she hated all\r\nmen because of her husband, she still felt sincerely sorry for Pere\r\nBru, the poor old man. They were letting him starve to death because he\r\ncould no longer hold tools in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe laundress also suffered a great deal from the close neighborhood of\r\nBazouge, the undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helper. A simple partition, and a very thin\r\none, separated the two rooms. He could not put his fingers down his\r\nthroat without her hearing it. As soon as he came home of an evening\r\nshe listened, in spite of herself, to everything he did. His black\r\nleather hat laid with a dull thud on the chest of drawers, like a\r\nshovelful of earth; the black cloak hung up and rustling against the\r\nwalls like the wings of some night bird; all the black toggery flung\r\ninto the middle of the room and filling it with the trappings of\r\nmourning. She heard him stamping about, felt anxious at the least\r\nmovement, and was quite startled if he knocked against the furniture or\r\nrattled any of his crockery. This confounded drunkard was her\r\npreoccupation, filling her with a secret fear mingled with a desire to\r\nknow. He, jolly, his belly full every day, his head all upside down,\r\ncoughed, spat, sang \xe2\x80\x9cMother Godichon,\xe2\x80\x9d made use of many dirty\r\nexpressions and fought with the four walls before finding his bedstead.\r\nAnd she remained quite pale, wondering what he could be doing in there.\r\nShe imagined the most atrocious things. She got into her head that he\r\nmust have brought a corpse home, and was stowing it away under his\r\nbedstead. Well! the newspapers had related something of the kind\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nundertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helper who collected the coffins of little children at his\r\nhome, so as to save himself trouble and to make only one journey to the\r\ncemetery.\r\n\r\nFor certain, directly Bazouge arrived, a smell of death seemed to\r\npermeate the partition. One might have thought oneself lodging against\r\nthe Pere Lachaise cemetery, in the midst of the kingdom of moles. He\r\nwas frightful, the animal, continually laughing all by himself, as\r\nthough his profession enlivened him. Even when he had finished his\r\nrumpus and had laid himself on his back, he snored in a manner so\r\nextraordinary that it caused the laundress to hold her breath. For\r\nhours she listened attentively, with an idea that funerals were passing\r\nthrough her neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nThe worst was that, in spite of her terrors, something incited Gervaise\r\nto put her ear to the wall, the better to find out what was taking\r\nplace. Bazouge had the same effect on her as handsome men have on good\r\nwomen: they would like to touch them. Well! if fear had not kept her\r\nback, Gervaise would have liked to have handled death, to see what it\r\nwas like. She became so peculiar at times, holding her breath,\r\nlistening attentively, expecting to unravel the secret through one of\r\nBazouge\xe2\x80\x99s movements, that Coupeau would ask her with a chuckle if she\r\nhad a fancy for that gravedigger next door. She got angry and talked of\r\nmoving, the close proximity of this neighbor was so distasteful to her;\r\nand yet, in spite of herself, as soon as the old chap arrived, smelling\r\nlike a cemetery, she became wrapped again in her reflections, with the\r\nexcited and timorous air of a wife thinking of passing a knife through\r\nthe marriage contract. Had he not twice offered to pack her up and\r\ncarry her off with him to some place where the enjoyment of sleep is so\r\ngreat, that in a moment one forgets all one\xe2\x80\x99s wretchedness? Perhaps it\r\nwas really very pleasant. Little by little the temptation to taste it\r\nbecame stronger. She would have liked to have tried it for a fortnight\r\nor a month. Oh! to sleep a month, especially in winter, the month when\r\nthe rent became due, when the troubles of life were killing her! But it\r\nwas not possible\xe2\x80\x94one must sleep forever, if one commences to sleep for\r\nan hour; and the thought of this froze her, her desire for death\r\ndeparted before the eternal and stern friendship which the earth\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nHowever, one evening in January she knocked with both her fists against\r\nthe partition. She had passed a frightful week, hustled by everyone,\r\nwithout a sou, and utterly discouraged. That evening she was not at all\r\nwell, she shivered with fever, and seemed to see flames dancing about\r\nher. Then, instead of throwing herself out of the window, as she had at\r\none moment thought of doing, she set to knocking and calling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Bazouge! Old Bazouge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s helper was taking off his shoes and singing, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwere three lovely girls.\xe2\x80\x9d He had probably had a good day, for he seemed\r\neven more maudlin than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Bazouge! Old Bazouge!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gervaise, raising her voice.\r\n\r\nDid he not hear her then? She was ready to give herself at once; he\r\nmight come and take her on his neck, and carry her off to the place\r\nwhere he carried his other women, the poor and the rich, whom he\r\nconsoled. It pained her to hear his song, \xe2\x80\x9cThere were three lovely\r\ngirls,\xe2\x80\x9d because she discerned in it the disdain of a man with too many\r\nsweethearts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d stuttered Bazouge; \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99s unwell? We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncoming, little woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the sound of this husky voice awoke Gervaise as though from a\r\nnightmare. And a feeling of horror ascended from her knees to her\r\nshoulders at the thought of seeing herself lugged along in the old\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s arms, all stiff and her face as white as a china plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! is there no one there now?\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Bazouge in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a\r\nbit, we\xe2\x80\x99re always ready to oblige the ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the laundress at length in a choking\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t require anything, thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe remained anxious, listening to old Bazouge grumbling himself to\r\nsleep, afraid to stir for fear he would think he heard her knocking\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn her corner of misery, in the midst of her cares and the cares of\r\nothers, Gervaise had, however, a beautiful example of courage in the\r\nhome of her neighbors, the Bijards. Little Lalie, only eight years old\r\nand no larger than a sparrow, took care of the household as competently\r\nas a grown person. The job was not an easy one because she had two\r\nlittle tots, her brother Jules and her sister Henriette, aged three and\r\nfive, to watch all day long while sweeping and cleaning.\r\n\r\nEver since Bijard had killed his wife with a kick in the stomach, Lalie\r\nhad become the little mother of them all. Without saying a word, and of\r\nher own accord, she filled the place of one who had gone, to the extent\r\nthat her brute of a father, no doubt to complete the resemblance, now\r\nbelabored the daughter as he had formerly belabored the mother.\r\nWhenever he came home drunk, he required a woman to massacre. He did\r\nnot even notice that Lalie was quite little; he would not have beaten\r\nsome old trollop harder. Little Lalie, so thin it made you cry, took it\r\nall without a word of complaint in her beautiful, patient eyes. Never\r\nwould she revolt. She bent her neck to protect her face and stifled her\r\nsobs so as not to alarm the neighbors. When her father got tired of\r\nkicking her, she would rest a bit until she got her strength back and\r\nthen resume her work. It was part of her job, being beaten daily.\r\n\r\nGervaise entertained a great friendship for her little neighbor. She\r\ntreated her as an equal, as a grown-up woman of experience. It must be\r\nsaid that Lalie had a pale and serious look, with the expression of an\r\nold girl. One might have thought her thirty on hearing her speak. She\r\nknew very well how to buy things, mend the clothes, attend to the home,\r\nand she spoke of the children as though she had already gone through\r\ntwo or three nurseries in her time. It made people smile to hear her\r\ntalk thus at eight years old; and then a lump would rise in their\r\nthroats, and they would hurry away so as not to burst out crying.\r\nGervaise drew the child towards her as much as she could, gave her all\r\nshe could spare of food and old clothing. One day as she tried one of\r\nNana\xe2\x80\x99s old dresses on her, she almost choked with anger on seeing her\r\nback covered with bruises, the skin off her elbow, which was still\r\nbleeding, and all her innocent flesh martyred and sticking to her\r\nbones. Well! Old Bazouge could get a box ready; she would not last long\r\nat that rate! But the child had begged the laundress not to say a word.\r\nShe would not have her father bothered on her account. She took his\r\npart, affirming that he would not have been so wicked if it had not\r\nbeen for the drink. He was mad, he did not know what he did. Oh! she\r\nforgave him, because one ought to forgive madmen everything.\r\n\r\nFrom that time Gervaise watched and prepared to interfere directly she\r\nheard Bijard coming up the stairs. But on most of the occasions she\r\nonly caught some whack for her trouble. When she entered their room in\r\nthe day-time, she often found Lalie tied to the foot of the iron\r\nbedstead; it was an idea of the locksmith\xe2\x80\x99s, before going out, to tie\r\nher legs and her body with some stout rope, without anyone being able\r\nto find out why\xe2\x80\x94a mere whim of a brain diseased by drink, just for the\r\nsake, no doubt, of maintaining his tyranny over the child when he was\r\nno longer there. Lalie, as stiff as a stake, with pins and needles in\r\nher legs, remained whole days at the post. She once even passed a night\r\nthere, Bijard having forgotten to come home. Whenever Gervaise, carried\r\naway by her indignation, talked of unfastening her, she implored her\r\nnot to disturb the rope, because her father became furious if he did\r\nnot find the knots tied the same way he had left them. Really, it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad, it gave her a rest. She smiled as she said this though\r\nher legs were swollen and bruised. What upset her the most was that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do her work while tied to the bed. She could watch the\r\nchildren though, and even did some knitting, so as not to entirely\r\nwaste the time.\r\n\r\nThe locksmith had thought of another little game too. He heated sous in\r\nthe frying pan, then placed them on a corner of the mantle-piece; and\r\nhe called Lalie, and told her to fetch a couple of pounds of bread. The\r\nchild took up the sous unsuspectingly, uttered a cry and threw them on\r\nthe ground, shaking her burnt hand. Then he flew into a fury. Who had\r\nsaddled him with such a piece of carrion? She lost the money now! And\r\nhe threatened to beat her to a jelly if she did not pick the sous up at\r\nonce. When the child hesitated she received the first warning, a clout\r\nof such force that it made her see thirty-six candles. Speechless and\r\nwith two big tears in the corners of her eyes, she would pick up the\r\nsous and go off, tossing them in the palm of her hand to cool them.\r\n\r\nNo, one could never imagine the ferocious ideas which may sprout from\r\nthe depths of a drunkard\xe2\x80\x99s brain. One afternoon, for instance, Lalie\r\nhaving made everything tidy was playing with the children. The window\r\nwas open, there was a draught, and the wind blowing along the passage\r\ngently shook the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Monsieur Hardy,\xe2\x80\x9d the child was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Monsieur Hardy.\r\nPray have the kindness to walk in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she curtsied before the door, she bowed to the wind. Henriette and\r\nJules, behind her, also bowed, delighted with the game and splitting\r\ntheir sides with laughing, as though being tickled. She was quite rosy\r\nat seeing them so heartily amused and even found some pleasure in it on\r\nher own account, which generally only happened to her on the\r\nthirty-sixth day of each month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, Monsieur Hardy. How do you do, Monsieur Hardy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a rough hand pushed open the door, and Bijard entered. Then the\r\nscene changed. Henriette and Jules fell down flat against the wall;\r\nwhilst Lalie, terrified, remained standing in the very middle of the\r\ncurtsey. The locksmith held in his hand a big waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s whip, quite\r\nnew, with a long white wooden handle, and a leather thong, terminating\r\nwith a bit of whip-cord. He placed the whip in the corner against the\r\nbed and did not give the usual kick to the child who was already\r\npreparing herself by presenting her back. A chuckle exposed his\r\nblackened teeth and he was very lively, very drunk, his red face\r\nlighted up by some idea that amused him immensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re playing the deuce, eh, you confounded\r\nyoung hussy! I could hear you dancing about from downstairs. Now then,\r\ncome here! Nearer and full face. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sniff you from behind.\r\nAm I touching you that you tremble like a mass of giblets? Take my\r\nshoes off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLalie turned quite pale again and, amazed at not receiving her usual\r\ndrubbing, took his shoes off. He had seated himself on the edge of the\r\nbed. He lay down with his clothes on and remained with his eyes open,\r\nwatching the child move about the room. She busied herself with one\r\nthing and another, gradually becoming bewildered beneath his glance,\r\nher limbs overcome by such a fright that she ended by breaking a cup.\r\nThen, without getting off the bed, he took hold of the whip and showed\r\nit to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, little chickie, look at this. It\xe2\x80\x99s a present for you. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother fifty sous you\xe2\x80\x99ve cost me. With this plaything I shall no\r\nlonger be obliged to run after you, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be no use you getting\r\ninto the corners. Will you have a try? Ah! you broke a cup! Now then,\r\ngee up! Dance away, make your curtsies to Monsieur Hardy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not even raise himself but lay sprawling on his back, his head\r\nburied in his pillow, making the big whip crack about the room with the\r\nnoise of a postillion starting his horses. Then, lowering his arm he\r\nlashed Lalie in the middle of the body, encircling her with the whip\r\nand unwinding it again as though she were a top. She fell and tried to\r\nescape on her hands and knees; but lashing her again he jerked her to\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee up, gee up!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the donkey race! Eh, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine\r\nof a cold morning in winter. I can lie snug without getting cold or\r\nhurting my chilblains and catch the calves from a distance. In that\r\ncorner there, a hit, you hussy! And in that other corner, a hit again!\r\nAnd in that one, another hit. Ah! if you crawl under the bed I\xe2\x80\x99ll whack\r\nyou with the handle. Gee up, you jade! Gee up! Gee up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA slight foam came to his lips, his yellow eyes were starting from\r\ntheir black orbits. Lalie, maddened, howling, jumped to the four\r\ncorners of the room, curled herself up on the floor and clung to the\r\nwalls; but the lash at the end of the big whip caught her everywhere,\r\ncracking against her ears with the noise of fireworks, streaking her\r\nflesh with burning weals. A regular dance of the animal being taught\r\nits tricks. This poor kitten waltzed. It was a sight! Her heels in the\r\nair like little girls playing at skipping, and crying \xe2\x80\x9cFather!\xe2\x80\x9d She was\r\nall out of breath, rebounding like an india-rubber ball, letting\r\nherself be beaten, unable to see or any longer to seek a refuge. And\r\nher wolf of a father triumphed, calling her a virago, asking her if she\r\nhad had enough and whether she understood sufficiently that she was in\r\nfuture to give up all hope of escaping from him.\r\n\r\nBut Gervaise suddenly entered the room, attracted by the child\xe2\x80\x99s howls.\r\nOn beholding such a scene she was seized with a furious indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you brute of a man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave her alone, you brigand!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put the police on to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBijard growled like an animal being disturbed, and stuttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind your own business a bit, Limper. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to put\r\ngloves on when I stir her up. It\xe2\x80\x99s merely to warm her, as you can\r\nplainly see\xe2\x80\x94simply to show her that I\xe2\x80\x99ve a long arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he gave a final lash with the whip which caught Lalie across the\r\nface. The upper lip was cut, the blood flowed. Gervaise had seized a\r\nchair, and was about to fall on to the locksmith; but the child held\r\nher hands towards her imploringly, saying that it was nothing and that\r\nit was all over. She wiped away the blood with the corner of her apron\r\nand quieted the babies, who were sobbing bitterly, as though they had\r\nreceived all the blows.\r\n\r\nWhenever Gervaise thought of Lalie, she felt she had no right to\r\ncomplain for herself. She wished she had as much patient courage as the\r\nlittle girl who was only eight years old and had to endure more than\r\nthe rest of the women on their staircase put together. She had seen\r\nLalie living on stale bread for months and growing thinner and weaker.\r\nWhenever she smuggled some remnants of meat to Lalie, it almost broke\r\nher heart to see the child weeping silently and nibbling it down only\r\nby little bits because her throat was so shrunken. Gervaise looked on\r\nLalie as a model of suffering and forgiveness and tried to learn from\r\nher how to suffer in silence.\r\n\r\nIn the Coupeau household the vitriol of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was also commencing\r\nits ravages. Gervaise could see the day coming when her husband would\r\nget a whip like Bijard\xe2\x80\x99s to make her dance.\r\n\r\nYes, Coupeau was spinning an evil thread. The time was past when a\r\ndrink would make him feel good. His unhealthy soft fat of earlier years\r\nhad melted away and he was beginning to wither and turn a leaden grey.\r\nHe seemed to have a greenish tint like a corpse putrefying in a pond.\r\nHe no longer had a taste for food, not even the most beautifully\r\nprepared stew. His stomach would turn and his decayed teeth refuse to\r\ntouch it. A pint a day was his daily ration, the only nourishment he\r\ncould digest. When he awoke in the mornings he sat coughing and\r\nspitting up bile for at least a quarter of an hour. It never failed,\r\nyou might as well have the basin ready. He was never steady on his pins\r\ntill after his first glass of consolation, a real remedy, the fire of\r\nwhich cauterized his bowels; but during the day his strength returned.\r\nAt first he would feel a tickling sensation, a sort of pins-and-needles\r\nin his hands and feet; and he would joke, relating that someone was\r\nhaving a lark with him, that he was sure his wife put horse-hair\r\nbetween the sheets. Then his legs would become heavy, the tickling\r\nsensation would end by turning into the most abominable cramps, which\r\ngripped his flesh as though in a vise. That though did not amuse him so\r\nmuch. He no longer laughed; he stopped suddenly on the pavement in a\r\nbewildered way with a ringing in his ears and his eyes blinded with\r\nsparks. Everything appeared to him to be yellow; the houses danced and\r\nhe reeled about for three seconds with the fear of suddenly finding\r\nhimself sprawling on the ground. At other times, while the sun was\r\nshining full on his back, he would shiver as though iced water had been\r\npoured down his shoulders. What bothered him the most was a slight\r\ntrembling of both his hands; the right hand especially must have been\r\nguilty of some crime, it suffered from so many nightmares. _Mon Dieu!_\r\nwas he then no longer a man? He was becoming an old woman! He furiously\r\nstrained his muscles, he seized hold of his glass and bet that he would\r\nhold it perfectly steady as with a hand of marble; but in spite of his\r\nefforts the glass danced about, jumped to the right, jumped to the left\r\nwith a hurried and regular trembling movement. Then in a fury he\r\nemptied it into his gullet, yelling that he would require dozens like\r\nit, and afterwards he undertook to carry a cask without so much as\r\nmoving a finger. Gervaise, on the other hand, told him to give up drink\r\nif he wished to cease trembling, and he laughed at her, emptying quarts\r\nuntil he experienced the sensation again, flying into a rage and\r\naccusing the passing omnibuses of shaking up his liquor.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March Coupeau returned home one evening soaked through.\r\nHe had come with My-Boots from Montrouge, where they had stuffed\r\nthemselves full of eel soup, and he had received the full force of the\r\nshower all the way from the Barriere des Fourneaux to the Barriere\r\nPoissonniere, a good distance. During the night he was seized with a\r\nconfounded fit of coughing. He was very flushed, suffering from a\r\nviolent fever and panting like a broken bellows. When the Boches\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndoctor saw him in the morning and listened against his back he shook\r\nhis head, and drew Gervaise aside to advise her to have her husband\r\ntaken to the hospital. Coupeau was suffering from pneumonia.\r\n\r\nGervaise did not worry herself, you may be sure. At one time she would\r\nhave been chopped into pieces before trusting her old man to the\r\nsaw-bones. After the accident in the Rue de la Nation she had spent\r\ntheir savings in nursing him. But those beautiful sentiments don\xe2\x80\x99t last\r\nwhen men take to wallowing in the mire. No, no; she did not intend to\r\nmake a fuss like that again. They might take him and never bring him\r\nback; she would thank them heartily. Yet, when the litter arrived and\r\nCoupeau was put into it like an article of furniture, she became all\r\npale and bit her lips; and if she grumbled and still said it was a good\r\njob, her heart was no longer in her words. Had she but ten francs in\r\nher drawer she would not have let him go.\r\n\r\nShe accompanied him to the Lariboisiere Hospital, saw the nurses put\r\nhim to bed at the end of a long hall, where the patients in a row,\r\nlooking like corpses, raised themselves up and followed with their eyes\r\nthe comrade who had just been brought in. It was a veritable death\r\nchamber. There was a suffocating, feverish odor and a chorus of\r\ncoughing. The long hall gave the impression of a small cemetery with\r\nits double row of white beds looking like an aisle of marble tombs.\r\nWhen Coupeau remained motionless on his pillow, Gervaise left, having\r\nnothing to say, nor anything in her pocket that could comfort him.\r\n\r\nOutside, she turned to look up at the monumental structure of the\r\nhospital and recalled the days when Coupeau was working there, putting\r\non the zinc roof, perched up high and singing in the sun. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndrinking in those days. She used to watch for him from her window in\r\nthe Hotel Boncoeur and they would both wave their handkerchiefs in\r\ngreeting. Now, instead of being on the roof like a cheerful sparrow, he\r\nwas down below. He had built his own place in the hospital where he had\r\ncome to die. _Mon Dieu!_ It all seemed so far way now, that time of\r\nyoung love.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the morrow, when Gervaise called to obtain news of\r\nhim, she found the bed empty. A Sister of Charity told her that they\r\nhad been obliged to remove her husband to the Asylum of Sainte-Anne,\r\nbecause the day before he had suddenly gone wild. Oh! a total\r\nleave-taking of his senses; attempts to crack his skull against the\r\nwall; howls which prevented the other patients from sleeping. It all\r\ncame from drink, it seemed. Gervaise went home very upset. Well, her\r\nhusband had gone crazy. What would it be like if he came home? Nana\r\ninsisted that they should leave him in the hospital because he might\r\nend by killing both of them.\r\n\r\nGervaise was not able to go to Sainte-Anne until Sunday. It was a\r\ntremendous journey. Fortunately, the omnibus from the Boulevard\r\nRochechouart to La Glaciere passed close to the asylum. She went down\r\nthe Rue de la Sante, buying two oranges on her way, so as not to arrive\r\nempty-handed. It was another monumental building, with grey courtyards,\r\ninterminable corridors and a smell of rank medicaments, which did not\r\nexactly inspire liveliness. But when they had admitted her into a cell\r\nshe was quite surprised to see Coupeau almost jolly. He was just then\r\nseated on the throne, a spotlessly clean wooden case, and they both\r\nlaughed at her finding him in this position. Well, one knows what an\r\ninvalid is. He squatted there like a pope with his cheek of earlier\r\ndays. Oh! he was better, as he could do this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the pneumonia?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the laundress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone for!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cThey cured it in no time. I still cough a\r\nlittle, but that\xe2\x80\x99s all that is left of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen at the moment of leaving the throne to get back into his bed, he\r\njoked once more. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky you have a strong nose and are not\r\nbothered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed louder than ever. At heart they felt joyful. It was by way\r\nof showing their contentment without a host of phrases that they thus\r\njoked together. One must have had to do with patients to know the\r\npleasure one feels at seeing all their functions at work again.\r\n\r\nWhen he was back in bed she gave him the two oranges and this filled\r\nhim with emotion. He was becoming quite nice again ever since he had\r\nhad nothing but tisane to drink. She ended by venturing to speak to him\r\nabout his violent attack, surprised at hearing him reason like in the\r\ngood old times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, joking at his own expense; \xe2\x80\x9cI talked a precious lot\r\nof nonsense! Just fancy, I saw rats and ran about on all fours to put a\r\ngrain of salt under their tails. And you, you called to me, men were\r\ntrying to kill you. In short, all sorts of stupid things, ghosts in\r\nbroad daylight. Oh! I remember it well, my noodle\xe2\x80\x99s still solid. Now\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s over, I dream a bit when I\xe2\x80\x99m asleep. I have nightmares, but\r\neveryone has nightmares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise remained with him until the evening. When the house surgeon\r\ncame, at the six o\xe2\x80\x99clock inspection, he made him spread his hands; they\r\nhardly trembled at all, scarcely a quiver at the tips of the fingers.\r\nHowever, as night approached, Coupeau was little by little seized with\r\nuneasiness. He twice sat up in bed looking on the ground and in the\r\ndark corners of the room. Suddenly he thrust out an arm and appeared to\r\ncrush some vermin against the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gervaise, frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rats! The rats!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he.\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, gliding into sleep, he tossed about, uttering\r\ndisconnected phrases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ they\xe2\x80\x99re tearing my skin!\xe2\x80\x94Oh! the filthy beasts!\xe2\x80\x94Keep\r\nsteady! Hold your skirts right round you! beware of the dirty bloke\r\nbehind you!\xe2\x80\x94_Mon Dieu!_ she\xe2\x80\x99s down and the scoundrels\r\nlaugh!\xe2\x80\x94Scoundrels! Blackguards! Brigands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dealt blows into space, caught hold of his blanket and rolled it\r\ninto a bundle against his chest, as though to protect the latter from\r\nthe violence of the bearded men whom he beheld. Then, an attendant\r\nhaving hastened to the spot, Gervaise withdrew, quite frozen by the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nBut when she returned a few days later, she found Coupeau completely\r\ncured. Even the nightmares had left him; he could sleep his ten hours\r\nright off as peacefully as a child and without stirring a limb. So his\r\nwife was allowed to take him away. The house surgeon gave him the usual\r\ngood advice on leaving and advised him to follow it. If he recommenced\r\ndrinking, he would again collapse and would end by dying. Yes, it\r\nsolely depended upon himself. He had seen how jolly and healthy one\r\ncould become when one did not get drunk. Well, he must continue at home\r\nthe sensible life he had led at Sainte-Anne, fancy himself under lock\r\nand key and that dram-shops no longer existed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise in the omnibus which was taking\r\nthem back to the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Coupeau.\r\n\r\nThen, after thinking a minute, he resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you know, a little glass now and again can\xe2\x80\x99t kill a man; it helps\r\nthe digestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd that very evening he swallowed a glass of bad spirit, just to keep\r\nhis stomach in order. For eight days he was pretty reasonable. He was a\r\ngreat coward at heart; he had no desire to end his days in the Bicetre\r\nmad-house. But his passion got the better of him; the first little\r\nglass led him, in spite of himself, to a second, to a third and to a\r\nfourth, and at the end of a fortnight, he had got back to his old\r\nration, a pint of vitriol a day. Gervaise, exasperated, could have\r\nbeaten him. To think that she had been stupid enough to dream once more\r\nof leading a worthy life, just because she had seen him at the asylum\r\nin full possession of his good sense! Another joyful hour had flown,\r\nthe last one no doubt! Oh! now, as nothing could reclaim him, not even\r\nthe fear of his near death, she swore she would no longer put herself\r\nout; the home might be all at sixes and sevens, she did not care any\r\nlonger; and she talked also of leaving him.\r\n\r\nThen hell upon earth recommenced, a life sinking deeper into the mire,\r\nwithout a glimmer of hope for something better to follow. Nana,\r\nwhenever her father clouted her, furiously asked why the brute was not\r\nat the hospital. She was awaiting the time when she would be earning\r\nmoney, she would say, to treat him to brandy and make him croak\r\nquicker. Gervaise, on her side, flew into a passion one day that\r\nCoupeau was regretting their marriage. Ah! she had brought him her\r\nsaucy children; ah! she had got herself picked up from the pavement,\r\nwheedling him with rosy dreams! _Mon Dieu!_ he had a rare cheek! So\r\nmany words, so many lies. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wished to have anything to do with\r\nhim, that was the truth. He had dragged himself at her feet to make her\r\ngive way, whilst she was advising him to think well what he was about.\r\nAnd if it was all to come over again, he would hear how she would just\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cno!\xe2\x80\x9d She would sooner have an arm cut off. Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99d had a lover\r\nbefore him; but a woman who has had a lover, and who is a worker, is\r\nworth more than a sluggard of a man who sullies his honor and that of\r\nhis family in all the dram-shops. That day, for the first time, the\r\nCoupeaus went in for a general brawl, and they whacked each other so\r\nhard that an old umbrella and the broom were broken.\r\n\r\nGervaise kept her word. She sank lower and lower; she missed going to\r\nher work oftener, spent whole days in gossiping, and became as soft as\r\na rag whenever she had a task to perform. If a thing fell from her\r\nhands, it might remain on the floor; it was certainly not she who would\r\nhave stooped to pick it up. She took her ease about everything, and\r\nnever handled a broom except when the accumulation of filth almost\r\nbrought her to the ground. The Lorilleuxs now made a point of holding\r\nsomething to their noses whenever they passed her room; the stench was\r\npoisonous, said they. Those hypocrites slyly lived at the end of the\r\npassage, out of the way of all these miseries which filled the corner\r\nof the house with whimpering, locking themselves in so as not to have\r\nto lend twenty sou pieces. Oh! kind-hearted folks, neighbors awfully\r\nobliging! Yes, you may be sure! One had only to knock and ask for a\r\nlight or a pinch of salt or a jug of water, one was certain of getting\r\nthe door banged in one\xe2\x80\x99s face. With all that they had vipers\xe2\x80\x99 tongues.\r\nThey protested everywhere that they never occupied themselves with\r\nother people. This was true whenever it was a question of assisting a\r\nneighbor; but they did so from morning to night, directly they had a\r\nchance of pulling any one to pieces. With the door bolted and a rug\r\nhung up to cover the chinks and the key-hole, they would treat\r\nthemselves to a spiteful gossip without leaving their gold wire for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Clump-clump in particular kept them purring like pet cats.\r\nCompletely ruined! Not a sou remaining. They smiled gleefully at the\r\nsmall piece of bread she would bring back when she went shopping and\r\nkept count of the days when she had nothing at all to eat. And the\r\nclothes she wore now. Disgusting rags! That\xe2\x80\x99s what happened when one\r\ntried to live high.\r\n\r\nGervaise, who had an idea of the way in which they spoke of her, would\r\ntake her shoes off, and place her ear against their door; but the rug\r\nover the door prevented her from hearing much. She was heartily sick of\r\nthem; she continued to speak to them, to avoid remarks, though\r\nexpecting nothing but unpleasantness from such nasty persons, but no\r\nlonger having strength even to give them as much as they gave her,\r\npassed the insults off as a lot of nonsense. And besides she only\r\nwanted her own pleasure, to sit in a heap twirling her thumbs, and only\r\nmoving when it was a question of amusing herself, nothing more.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday Coupeau had promised to take her to the circus. It was\r\nwell worth while disturbing oneself to see ladies galloping along on\r\nhorses and jumping through paper hoops. Coupeau had just finished a\r\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x99s work, he could well spare a couple of francs; and they had\r\nalso arranged to dine out, just the two of them, Nana having to work\r\nvery late that evening at her employer\xe2\x80\x99s because of some pressing\r\norder. But at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock there was no Coupeau; at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock it\r\nwas still the same. Gervaise was furious. Her drunkard was certainly\r\nsquandering his earnings with his comrades at the dram-shops of the\r\nneighborhood. She had washed a cap and had been slaving since the\r\nmorning over the holes of an old dress, wishing to look decent. At\r\nlast, towards nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, her stomach empty, her face purple with\r\nrage, she decided to go down and look for Coupeau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your husband you want?\xe2\x80\x9d called Madame Boche, on catching sight\r\nof Gervaise looking very glum. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s at Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s. Boche has just\r\nbeen having some cherry brandy with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise uttered her thanks and stalked stiffly along the pavement with\r\nthe determination of flying at Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. A fine rain was falling\r\nwhich made the walk more unpleasant still. But when she reached\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir, the fear of receiving the drubbing herself if she badgered\r\nher old man suddenly calmed her and made her prudent. The shop was\r\nablaze with the lighted gas, the flames of which were as brilliant as\r\nsuns, and the bottles and jars illuminated the walls with their colored\r\nglass. She stood there an instant stretching her neck, her eyes close\r\nto the window, looking between two bottle placed there for show,\r\nwatching Coupeau who was right at the back; he was sitting with some\r\ncomrades at a little zinc table, all looking vague and blue in the\r\ntobacco smoke; and, as one could not hear them yelling, it created a\r\nfunny effect to see them gesticulating with their chins thrust forward\r\nand their eyes starting out of their heads. Good heavens! Was it really\r\npossible that men could leave their wives and their homes to shut\r\nthemselves up thus in a hole where they were choking?\r\n\r\nThe rain trickled down her neck; she drew herself up and went off to\r\nthe exterior Boulevard, wrapped in thought and not daring to enter. Ah!\r\nwell Coupeau would have welcomed her in a pleasant way, he who objected\r\nto be spied upon! Besides, it really scarcely seemed to her the proper\r\nplace for a respectable woman. Twice she went back and stood before the\r\nshop window, her eyes again riveted to the glass, annoyed at still\r\nbeholding those confounded drunkards out of the rain and yelling and\r\ndrinking. The light of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir was reflected in the puddles on the\r\npavement, which simmered with little bubbles caused by the downpour. At\r\nlength she thought she was too foolish, and pushing open the door, she\r\nwalked straight up to the table where Coupeau was sitting. After all it\r\nwas her husband she came for, was it not? And she was authorized in\r\ndoing so, because he had promised to take her to the circus that\r\nevening. So much the worse! She had no desire to melt like a cake of\r\nsoap out on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo! It\xe2\x80\x99s you, old woman!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the zinc-worker, half choking\r\nwith a chuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s a good joke. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a good joke now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the company laughed. Gervaise remained standing, feeling rather\r\nbewildered. Coupeau appeared to her to be in a pleasant humor, so she\r\nventured to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember, we\xe2\x80\x99ve somewhere to go. We must hurry. We shall still be\r\nin time to see something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get up, I\xe2\x80\x99m glued, oh! without joking,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Coupeau, who\r\ncontinued laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cTry, just to satisfy yourself; pull my arm with\r\nall your strength; try it! harder than that, tug away, up with it! You\r\nsee it\xe2\x80\x99s that louse Pere Colombe who\xe2\x80\x99s screwed me to his seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had humored him at this game, and when she let go of his arm,\r\nthe comrades thought the joke so good that they tumbled up against one\r\nanother, braying and rubbing their shoulders like donkeys being\r\ngroomed. The zinc-worker\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was so wide with laughter that you\r\ncould see right down his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou great noodle!\xe2\x80\x9d said he at length, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can surely sit down a\r\nminute. You\xe2\x80\x99re better here than splashing about outside. Well, yes; I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t come home as I promised, I had business to attend to. Though you\r\nmay pull a long face, it won\xe2\x80\x99t alter matters. Make room, you others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf madame would accept my knees she would find them softer than the\r\nseat,\xe2\x80\x9d gallantly said My-Boots.\r\n\r\nGervaise, not wishing to attract attention, took a chair and sat down\r\nat a short distance from the table. She looked at what the men were\r\ndrinking, some rotgut brandy which shone like gold in the glasses; a\r\nlittle of it had dropped upon the table and Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst, dipped his finger in it whilst conversing and\r\nwrote a woman\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEulalie\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in big letters. She noticed that\r\nBibi-the-Smoker looked shockingly jaded and thinner than a\r\nhundred-weight of nails. My-Boot\xe2\x80\x99s nose was in full bloom, a regular\r\npurple Burgundy dahlia. They were all quite dirty, their beards stiff,\r\ntheir smocks ragged and stained, their hands grimy with dirt. Yet they\r\nwere still quite polite.\r\n\r\nGervaise noticed a couple of men at the bar. They were so drunk that\r\nthey were spilling the drink down their chins when they thought they\r\nwere wetting their whistles. Fat Pere Colombe was calmly serving round\r\nafter round.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was very warm, the smoke from the pipes ascended in the\r\nblinding glare of the gas, amidst which it rolled about like dust,\r\ndrowning the customers in a gradually thickening mist; and from this\r\ncloud there issued a deafening and confused uproar, cracked voices,\r\nclinking of glasses, oaths and blows sounding like detonations. So\r\nGervaise pulled a very wry face, for such a sight is not funny for a\r\nwoman, especially when she is not used to it; she was stifling, with a\r\nsmarting sensation in her eyes, and her head already feeling heavy from\r\nthe alcoholic fumes exhaled by the whole place. Then she suddenly\r\nexperienced the sensation of something more unpleasant still behind her\r\nback. She turned round and beheld the still, the machine which\r\nmanufactured drunkards, working away beneath the glass roof of the\r\nnarrow courtyard with the profound trepidation of its hellish cookery.\r\nOf an evening, the copper parts looked more mournful than ever, lit up\r\nonly on their rounded surface with one big red glint; and the shadow of\r\nthe apparatus on the wall at the back formed most abominable figures,\r\nbodies with tails, monsters opening their jaws as though to swallow\r\neveryone up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, mother Talk-too-much, don\xe2\x80\x99t make any of your grimaces!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nCoupeau. \xe2\x80\x9cTo blazes, you know, with all wet blankets! What\xe2\x80\x99ll you\r\ndrink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the laundress. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t dined yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason for having a glass; a drop of\r\nsomething sustains one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, as she still retained her glum expression, My-Boots again did the\r\ngallant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame probably likes sweet things,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like men who don\xe2\x80\x99t get drunk,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted she, getting angry. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\r\nlike a fellow who brings home his earnings, and who keeps his word when\r\nhe makes a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! so that\xe2\x80\x99s what upsets you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the zinc-worker, without ceasing\r\nto chuckle. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you want your share. Then, big goose, why do you\r\nrefuse a drink? Take it, it\xe2\x80\x99s so much to the good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him fixedly, in a grave manner, a wrinkle marking her\r\nforehead with a black line. And she slowly replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea. That way, we can drink up the\r\ncoin together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBibi-the-Smoker rose from his seat to fetch her a glass of anisette.\r\nShe drew her chair up to the table. Whilst she was sipping her\r\nanisette, a recollection suddenly flashed across her mind, she\r\nremembered the plum she had taken with Coupeau, near the door, in the\r\nold days, when he was courting her. At that time, she used to leave the\r\njuice of fruits preserved in brandy. And now, here was she going back\r\nto liqueurs. Oh! she knew herself well, she had not two thimblefuls of\r\nwill. One would only have had to have given her a walloping across the\r\nback to have made her regularly wallow in drink. The anisette even\r\nseemed to be very good, perhaps rather too sweet and slightly\r\nsickening. She went on sipping as she listened to Salted-Mouth,\r\notherwise Drink-without-Thirst, tell of his affair with fat Eulalie, a\r\nfish peddler and very shrewd at locating him. Even if his comrades\r\ntried to hide him, she could usually sniff him out when he was late.\r\nJust the night before she had slapped his face with a flounder to teach\r\nhim not to neglect going to work. Bibi-the-Smoker and My-Boots nearly\r\nsplit their sides laughing. They slapped Gervaise on the shoulder and\r\nshe began to laugh also, finding it amusing in spite of herself. They\r\nthen advised her to follow Eulalie\xe2\x80\x99s example and bring an iron with her\r\nso as to press Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s ears on the counters of the wineshops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, no thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau as he turned upside down the glass\r\nhis wife had emptied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou pump it out pretty well. Just look, you\r\nfellows, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill madame take another?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Salted-Mouth, otherwise\r\nDrink-without-Thirst.\r\n\r\nNo, she had had enough. Yet she hesitated. The anisette had slightly\r\nbothered her stomach. She should have taken straight brandy to settle\r\nher digestion.\r\n\r\nShe cast side glances at the drunkard manufacturing machine behind her.\r\nThat confounded pot, as round as the stomach of a tinker\xe2\x80\x99s fat wife,\r\nwith its nose that was so long and twisted, sent a shiver down her\r\nback, a fear mingled with a desire. Yes, one might have thought it the\r\nmetal pluck of some big wicked woman, of some witch who was discharging\r\ndrop by drop the fire of her entrails. A fine source of poison, an\r\noperation which should have been hidden away in a cellar, it was so\r\nbrazen and abominable! But all the same she would have liked to have\r\npoked her nose inside it, to have sniffed the odor, have tasted the\r\nfilth, though the skin might have peeled off her burnt tongue like the\r\nrind off an orange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re drinking?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she slyly of the men, her eyes\r\nlighted up by the beautiful golden color of their glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Coupeau, \xe2\x80\x9cis Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s camphor. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe silly now and we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a taste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when they had brought her a glass of the vitriol, the rotgut, and\r\nher jaws had contracted at the first mouthful, the zinc-worker resumed,\r\nslapping his thighs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! It tickles your gullet! Drink it off at one go. Each glassful\r\ncheats the doctor of six francs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the second glass Gervaise no longer felt the hunger which had been\r\ntormenting her. Now she had made it up with Coupeau, she no longer felt\r\nangry with him for not having kept his word. They would go to the\r\ncircus some other day; it was not so funny to see jugglers galloping\r\nabout on horses. There was no rain inside Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s and if the\r\nmoney went in brandy, one at least had it in one\xe2\x80\x99s body; one drank it\r\nbright and shining like beautiful liquid gold. Ah! she was ready to\r\nsend the whole world to blazes! Life was not so pleasant after all,\r\nbesides it seemed some consolation to her to have her share in\r\nsquandering the cash. As she was comfortable, why should she not\r\nremain? One might have a discharge of artillery; she did not care to\r\nbudge once she had settled in a heap. She nursed herself in a pleasant\r\nwarmth, her bodice sticking to her back, overcome by a feeling of\r\ncomfort which benumbed her limbs. She laughed all to herself, her\r\nelbows on the table, a vacant look in her eyes, highly amused by two\r\ncustomers, a fat heavy fellow and a tiny shrimp, seated at a\r\nneighboring table, and kissing each other lovingly. Yes, she laughed at\r\nthe things to see in l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir, at Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s full moon face, a\r\nregular bladder of lard, at the customers smoking their short clay\r\npipes, yelling and spitting, and at the big flames of gas which lighted\r\nup the looking-glasses and the bottles of liqueurs. The smell no longer\r\nbothered her, on the contrary it tickled her nose, and she thought it\r\nvery pleasant. Her eyes slightly closed, whilst she breathed very\r\nslowly, without the least feeling of suffocation, tasting the enjoyment\r\nof the gentle slumber which was overcoming her. Then, after her third\r\nglass, she let her chin fall on her hands; she now only saw Coupeau and\r\nhis comrades, and she remained nose to nose with them, quite close, her\r\ncheeks warmed by their breath, looking at their dirty beards as though\r\nshe had been counting the hairs. My-Boots drooled, his pipe between his\r\nteeth, with the dumb and grave air of a dozing ox. Bibi-the-Smoker was\r\ntelling a story\xe2\x80\x94the manner in which he emptied a bottle at a draught,\r\ngiving it such a kiss that one instantly saw its bottom. Meanwhile\r\nSalted-Mouth, otherwise Drink-without-Thirst, had gone and fetched the\r\nwheel of fortune from the counter, and was playing with Coupeau for\r\ndrinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred! You\xe2\x80\x99re lucky; you get high numbers every time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe needle of the wheel grated, and the figure of Fortune, a big red\r\nwoman placed under glass, turned round and round until it looked like a\r\nmere spot in the centre, similar to a wine stain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree hundred and fifty! You must have been inside it, you confounded\r\nlascar! Ah! I shan\xe2\x80\x99t play any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise amused herself with the wheel of fortune. She was feeling\r\nawfully thirsty, and calling My-Boots \xe2\x80\x9cmy child.\xe2\x80\x9d Behind her the\r\nmachine for manufacturing drunkards continued working, with its murmur\r\nof an underground stream; and she despaired of ever stopping it, of\r\nexhausting it, filled with a sullen anger against it, feeling a longing\r\nto spring upon the big still as upon some animal, to kick it with her\r\nheels and stave in its belly. Then everything began to seem all mixed\r\nup. The machine seemed to be moving itself and she thought she was\r\nbeing grabbed by its copper claws, and that the underground stream was\r\nnow flowing over her body.\r\n\r\nThen the room danced round, the gas-jets seemed to shoot like stars.\r\nGervaise was drunk. She heard a furious wrangle between Salted-Mouth,\r\notherwise Drink-without-Thirst, and that rascal Pere Colombe. There was\r\na thief of a landlord who wanted one to pay for what one had not had!\r\nYet one was not at a gangster\xe2\x80\x99s hang-out. Suddenly there was a\r\nscuffling, yells were heard and tables were upset. It was Pere Colombe\r\nwho was turning the party out without the least hesitation, and in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye. On the other side of the door they blackguarded\r\nhim and called him a scoundrel. It still rained and blew icy cold.\r\nGervaise lost Coupeau, found him and then lost him again. She wished to\r\ngo home; she felt the shops to find her way. This sudden darkness\r\nsurprised her immensely. At the corner of the Rue des Poissonniers, she\r\nsat down in the gutter thinking she was at the wash-house. The water\r\nwhich flowed along caused her head to swim, and made her very ill. At\r\nlength she arrived, she passed stiffly before the concierge\xe2\x80\x99s room\r\nwhere she perfectly recognized the Lorilleuxs and the Poissons seated\r\nat the table having dinner, and who made grimaces of disgust on\r\nbeholding her in that sorry state.\r\n\r\nShe never remembered how she had got up all those flights of stairs.\r\nJust as she was turning into the passage at the top, little Lalie, who\r\nheard her footsteps, hastened to meet her, opening her arms\r\ncaressingly, and saying, with a smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Gervaise, papa has not returned. Just come and see my little\r\nchildren sleeping. Oh! they look so pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut on beholding the laundress\xe2\x80\x99 besotted face, she tremblingly drew\r\nback. She was acquainted with that brandy-laden breath, those pale\r\neyes, that convulsed mouth. Then Gervaise stumbled past without\r\nuttering a word, whilst the child, standing on the threshold of her\r\nroom, followed her with her dark eyes, grave and speechless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nNana was growing up and becoming wayward. At fifteen years old she had\r\nexpanded like a calf, white-skinned and very fat; so plump, indeed, you\r\nmight have called her a pincushion. Yes, such she was\xe2\x80\x94fifteen years\r\nold, full of figure and no stays. A saucy magpie face, dipped in milk,\r\na skin as soft as a peach skin, a funny nose, pink lips and eyes\r\nsparkling like tapers, which men would have liked to light their pipes\r\nat. Her pile of fair hair, the color of fresh oats, seemed to have\r\nscattered gold dust over her temples, freckle-like as it were, giving\r\nher brow a sunny crown. Ah! a pretty doll, as the Lorilleuxs say, a\r\ndirty nose that needed wiping, with fat shoulders, which were as fully\r\nrounded and as powerful as those of a full-grown woman. Nana no longer\r\nneeded to stuff wads of paper into her bodice, her breasts were grown.\r\nShe wished they were larger though, and dreamed of having breasts like\r\na wet-nurse.\r\n\r\nWhat made her particularly tempting was a nasty habit she had of\r\nprotruding the tip of her tongue between her white teeth. No doubt on\r\nseeing herself in the looking-glasses she had thought she was pretty\r\nlike this; and so, all day long, she poked her tongue out of her mouth,\r\nin view of improving her appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHide your lying tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her mother.\r\n\r\nCoupeau would often get involved, pounding his fist, swearing and\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake haste and draw that red rag inside again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana showed herself very coquettish. She did not always wash her feet,\r\nbut she bought such tight boots that she suffered martyrdom in St.\r\nCrispin\xe2\x80\x99s prison; and if folks questioned her when she turned purple\r\nwith pain, she answered that she had the stomach ache, so as to avoid\r\nconfessing her coquetry. When bread was lacking at home it was\r\ndifficult for her to trick herself out. But she accomplished miracles,\r\nbrought ribbons back from the workshop and concocted toilettes\xe2\x80\x94dirty\r\ndresses set off with bows and puffs. The summer was the season of her\r\ngreatest triumphs. With a cambric dress which had cost her six francs\r\nshe filled the whole neighborhood of the Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or with her fair\r\nbeauty. Yes, she was known from the outer Boulevards to the\r\nFortifications, and from the Chaussee de Clignancourt to the Grand Rue\r\nof La Chapelle. Folks called her \xe2\x80\x9cchickie,\xe2\x80\x9d for she was really as\r\ntender and as fresh-looking as a chicken.\r\n\r\nThere was one dress which suited her perfectly, a white one with pink\r\ndots. It was very simple and without a frill. The skirt was rather\r\nshort and revealed her ankles. The sleeves were deeply slashed and\r\nloose, showing her arms to the elbow. She pinned the neck back into a\r\nwide V as soon as she reached a dark corner of the staircase to avoid\r\ngetting her ears boxed by her father for exposing the snowy whiteness\r\nof her throat and the golden shadow between her breasts. She also tied\r\na pink ribbon round her blond hair.\r\n\r\nSundays she spent the entire day out with the crowds and loved it when\r\nthe men eyed her hungrily as they passed. She waited all week long for\r\nthese glances. She would get up early to dress herself and spend hours\r\nbefore the fragment of mirror that was hung over the bureau. Her mother\r\nwould scold her because the entire building could see her through the\r\nwindow in her chemise as she mended her dress.\r\n\r\nAh! she looked cute like that said father Coupeau, sneering and jeering\r\nat her, a real Magdalene in despair! She might have turned \xe2\x80\x9csavage\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x9d at a fair, and have shown herself for a penny. Hide your meat,\r\nhe used to say, and let me eat my bread! In fact, she was adorable,\r\nwhite and dainty under her overhanging golden fleece, losing temper to\r\nthe point that her skin turned pink, not daring to answer her father,\r\nbut cutting her thread with her teeth with a hasty, furious jerk, which\r\nshook her plump but youthful form.\r\n\r\nThen immediately after breakfast she tripped down the stairs into the\r\ncourtyard. The entire tenement seemed to be resting sleepily in the\r\npeacefulness of a Sunday afternoon. The workshops on the ground floor\r\nwere closed. Gaping windows revealed tables in some apartments that\r\nwere already set for dinner, awaiting families out working up an\r\nappetite by strolling along the fortifications.\r\n\r\nThen, in the midst of the empty, echoing courtyard, Nana, Pauline and\r\nother big girls engaged in games of battledore and shuttlecock. They\r\nhad grown up together and were now becoming queens of their building.\r\nWhenever a man crossed the court, flutelike laugher would arise, and\r\nthen starched skirts would rustle like the passing of a gust of wind.\r\n\r\nThe games were only an excuse for them to make their escape. Suddenly\r\nstillness fell upon the tenement. The girls had glided out into the\r\nstreet and made for the outer Boulevards. Then, linked arm-in-arm\r\nacross the full breadth of the pavement, they went off, the whole six\r\nof them, clad in light colors, with ribbons tied around their bare\r\nheads. With bright eyes darting stealthy glances through their\r\npartially closed eyelids, they took note of everything, and constantly\r\nthrew back their necks to laugh, displaying the fleshy part of their\r\nchins. They would swing their hips, or group together tightly, or\r\nflaunt along with awkward grace, all for the purpose of calling\r\nattention to the fact that their forms were filling out.\r\n\r\nNana was in the centre with her pink dress all aglow in the sunlight.\r\nShe gave her arm to Pauline, whose costume, yellow flowers on a white\r\nground, glared in similar fashion, dotted as it were with little\r\nflames. As they were the tallest of the band, the most woman-like and\r\nmost unblushing, they led the troop and drew themselves up with breasts\r\nwell forward whenever they detected glances or heard complimentary\r\nremarks. The others extended right and left, puffing themselves out in\r\norder to attract attention. Nana and Pauline resorted to the\r\ncomplicated devices of experienced coquettes. If they ran till they\r\nwere out of breath, it was in view of showing their white stockings and\r\nmaking the ribbons of their chignons wave in the breeze. When they\r\nstopped, pretending complete breathlessness, you would certainly spot\r\nsomeone they knew quite near, one of the young fellows of the\r\nneighborhood. This would make them dawdle along languidly, whispering\r\nand laughing among themselves, but keeping a sharp watch through their\r\ndowncast eyelids.\r\n\r\nThey went on these strolls of a Sunday mainly for the sake of these\r\nchance meetings. Tall lads, wearing their Sunday best, would stop them,\r\njoking and trying to catch them round their waists. Pauline was forever\r\nrunning into one of Madame Gaudron\xe2\x80\x99s sons, a seventeen-year-old\r\ncarpenter, who would treat her to fried potatoes. Nana could spot\r\nVictor Fauconnier, the laundress\xe2\x80\x99s son and they would exchange kisses\r\nin dark corners. It never went farther than that, but they told each\r\nother some tall tales.\r\n\r\nThen when the sun set, the great delight of these young hussies was to\r\nstop and look at the mountebanks. Conjurors and strong men turned up\r\nand spread threadbare carpets on the soil of the avenue. Loungers\r\ncollected and a circle formed whilst the mountebank in the centre tried\r\nhis muscles under his faded tights. Nana and Pauline would stand for\r\nhours in the thickest part of the crowd. Their pretty, fresh frocks\r\nwould get crushed between great-coats and dirty work smocks. In this\r\natmosphere of wine and sweat they would laugh gaily, finding amusement\r\nin everything, blooming naturally like roses growing out of a dunghill.\r\nThe only thing that vexed them was to meet their fathers, especially\r\nwhen the latter had been drinking. So they watched and warned one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Nana,\xe2\x80\x9d Pauline would suddenly cry out, \xe2\x80\x9chere comes father\r\nCoupeau!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s drunk too. Oh, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nana, greatly bothered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to beat it, you know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to give me a wallop.\r\nHullo! How he stumbles! Good Lord, if he could only break his neck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt other times, when Coupeau came straight up to her without giving her\r\ntime to run off, she crouched down, made herself small and muttered:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust you hide me, you others. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking for me, and he promised\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d knock my head off if he caught me hanging about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen when the drunkard had passed them she drew herself up again, and\r\nall the others followed her with bursts of laughter. He\xe2\x80\x99ll find her\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x94he won\xe2\x80\x99t! It was a true game of hide and seek. One day, however,\r\nBoche had come after Pauline and caught her by both ears, and Coupeau\r\nhad driven Nana home with kicks.\r\n\r\nNana was now a flower-maker and earned forty sous a day at Titreville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace in the Rue du Caire, where she had served as apprentice. The\r\nCoupeaus had kept her there so that she might remain under the eye of\r\nMadame Lerat, who had been forewoman in the workroom for ten years. Of\r\na morning, when her mother looked at the cuckoo clock, off she went by\r\nherself, looking very pretty with her shoulders tightly confined in her\r\nold black dress, which was both too narrow and too short; and Madame\r\nLerat had to note the hour of her arrival and tell it to Gervaise. She\r\nwas allowed twenty minutes to go from the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or to the\r\nRue du Caire, and it was enough, for these young hussies have the legs\r\nof racehorses. Sometimes she arrived exactly on time but so breathless\r\nand flushed that she must have covered most of the distance at a run\r\nafter dawdling along the way. More often she was a few minutes late.\r\nThen she would fawn on her aunt all day, hoping to soften her and keep\r\nher from telling. Madame Lerat understood what it was to be young and\r\nwould lie to the Coupeaus, but she also lectured Nana, stressing the\r\ndangers a young girl runs on the streets of Paris. _Mon Dieu!_ she\r\nherself was followed often enough!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I watch, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the widow to the Coupeaus. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill answer to you for her as I would for myself. And rather than let a\r\nblackguard squeeze her, why I\xe2\x80\x99d step between them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workroom at Titreville\xe2\x80\x99s was a large apartment on the first floor,\r\nwith a broad work-table standing on trestles in the centre. Round the\r\nfour walls, the plaster of which was visible in parts where the dirty\r\nyellowish-grey paper was torn away, there were several stands covered\r\nwith old cardboard boxes, parcels and discarded patterns under a thick\r\ncoating of dust. The gas had left what appeared to be like a daub of\r\nsoot on the ceiling. The two windows opened so wide that without\r\nleaving the work-table the girls could see the people walking past on\r\nthe pavement over the way.\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat arrived the first, in view of setting an example. Then for\r\na quarter of an hour the door swayed to and fro, and all the workgirls\r\nscrambled in, perspiring with tumbled hair. One July morning Nana\r\narrived the last, as very often happened. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe a pity when I have a carriage of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d And without even taking\r\noff her hat, one which she was weary of patching up, she approached the\r\nwindow and leant out, looking to the right and the left to see what was\r\ngoing on in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Madame Lerat, suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cDid your\r\nfather come with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you may be sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nana coolly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking at\r\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing how hot it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make anyone, having to\r\nrun like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a stifling hot morning. The workgirls had drawn down the\r\nVenetian blinds, between which they could spy out into the street; and\r\nthey had at last begun working on either side of the table, at the\r\nupper end of which sat Madame Lerat. They were eight in number, each\r\nwith her pot of glue, pincers, tools and curling stand in front of her.\r\nOn the work-table lay a mass of wire, reels, cotton wool, green and\r\nbrown paper, leaves and petals cut out of silk, satin or velvet. In the\r\ncentre, in the neck of a large decanter, one flower-girl had thrust a\r\nlittle penny nosegay which had been fading on her breast since the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I have some news,\xe2\x80\x9d said a pretty brunette named Leonie as she\r\nleaned over her cushion to crimp some rose petals. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Caroline is\r\nvery unhappy about that fellow who used to wait for her every evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nana, who was cutting thin strips of green paper. \xe2\x80\x9cA man who\r\ncheats on her every day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lerat had to display severity over the muffled laughter. Then\r\nLeonie whispered suddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet. The boss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Madame Titreville who entered. The tall thin woman\r\nusually stayed down in the shop. The girls were quite in awe of her\r\nbecause she never joked with them. All the heads were now bent over the\r\nwork in diligent silence. Madame Titreville slowly circled the\r\nwork-table. She told one girl her work was sloppy and made her do the\r\nflower over. Then she stalked out as stiffly as she had come in.\r\n\r\nThe complaining and low laughter began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, young ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lerat, trying to look more severe\r\nthan ever. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will force me to take measures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe workgirls paid no attention to her. They were not afraid of her.\r\nShe was too easy-going because she enjoyed being surrounded by these\r\nyoung girls whose zest for life sparkled in their eyes. She enjoyed\r\ntaking them aside to hear their confidences about their lovers. She\r\neven told their fortunes with cards whenever a corner of the work-table\r\nwas free. She was only offended by coarse expressions. As long as you\r\navoided those you could say what you pleased.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Nana perfected her education in nice style in the\r\nworkroom! No doubt she was already inclined to go wrong. But this was\r\nthe finishing stroke\xe2\x80\x94associating with a lot of girls who were already\r\nworn out with misery and vice. They all hobnobbed and rotted together,\r\njust the story of the baskets of apples when there are rotten ones\r\namong them. They maintained a certain propriety in public, but the smut\r\nflowed freely when they got to whispering together in a corner.\r\n\r\nFor inexperienced girls like Nana, there was an undesirable atmosphere\r\naround the workshop, an air of cheap dance halls and unorthodox\r\nevenings brought in by some of the girls. The laziness of mornings\r\nafter a gay night, the shadows under the eyes, the lounging, the hoarse\r\nvoices, all spread an odor of dark perversion over the work-table which\r\ncontrasted sharply with the brilliant fragility of the artificial\r\nflowers. Nana eagerly drank it all in and was dizzy with joy when she\r\nfound herself beside a girl who had been around. She always wanted to\r\nsit next to big Lisa, who was said to be pregnant, and she kept\r\nglancing curiously at her neighbor as though expecting her to swell up\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hot enough to make one stifle,\xe2\x80\x9d Nana said, approaching a window\r\nas if to draw the blind farther down; but she leant forward and again\r\nlooked out both to the right and left.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Leonie, who was watching a man stationed at the foot\r\nof the pavement over the way, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that old fellow about?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s been spying here for the last quarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome tom cat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Lerat. \xe2\x80\x9cNana, just come and sit down! I\r\ntold you not to stand at the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana took up the stems of some violets she was rolling, and the whole\r\nworkroom turned its attention to the man in question. He was a\r\nwell-dressed individual wearing a frock coat and he looked about fifty\r\nyears old. He had a pale face, very serous and dignified in expression,\r\nframed round with a well trimmed grey beard. He remained for an hour in\r\nfront of a herbalist\xe2\x80\x99s shop with his eyes fixed on the Venetian blinds\r\nof the workroom. The flower-girls indulged in little bursts of laughter\r\nwhich died away amid the noise of the street, and while leaning\r\nforward, to all appearance busy with their work, they glanced askance\r\nso as not to lose sight of the gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Leonie, \xe2\x80\x9che wears glasses. He\xe2\x80\x99s a swell. He\xe2\x80\x99s waiting\r\nfor Augustine, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Augustine, a tall, ugly, fair-haired girl, sourly answered that she\r\ndid not like old men; whereupon Madame Lerat, jerking her head,\r\nanswered with a smile full of underhand meaning:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a great mistake on your part, my dear; the old ones are more\r\naffectionate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Leonie\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor, a plump little body, whispered\r\nsomething in her ear and Leonie suddenly threw herself back on her\r\nchair, seized with a fit of noisy laughter, wriggling, looking at the\r\ngentleman and then laughing all the louder. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Oh! that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe stammered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dirty that Sophie is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she say? What did she say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the whole workroom, aglow\r\nwith curiosity.\r\n\r\nLeonie wiped the tears from her eyes without answering. When she became\r\nsomewhat calmer, she began curling her flowers again and declared, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be repeated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others insisted, but she shook her head, seized again with a gust\r\nof gaiety. Thereupon Augustine, her left-hand neighbor, besought her to\r\nwhisper it to her; and finally Leonie consented to do so with her lips\r\nclose to Augustine\xe2\x80\x99s ear. Augustine threw herself back and wriggled\r\nwith convulsive laughter in her turn. Then she repeated the phrase to a\r\ngirl next to her, and from ear to ear it traveled round the room amid\r\nexclamations and stifled laughter. When they were all of them\r\nacquainted with Sophie\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting remark they looked at one another\r\nand burst out laughing together although a little flushed and confused.\r\nMadame Lerat alone was not in the secret and she felt extremely vexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very impolite behavior on your part, young ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not right to whisper when other people are present. Something\r\nindecent no doubt! Ah! that\xe2\x80\x99s becoming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not dare go so far as to ask them to pass Sophie\xe2\x80\x99s remark on to\r\nher although she burned to hear it. So she kept her eyes on her work,\r\namusing herself by listening to the conversation. Now no one could make\r\neven an innocent remark without the others twisting it around and\r\nconnecting it with the gentleman on the sidewalk. Madame Lerat herself\r\nonce sent them into convulsions of laughter when she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMademoiselle Lisa, my fire\xe2\x80\x99s gone out. Pass me yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Madame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s fire\xe2\x80\x99s out!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the whole shop.\r\n\r\nThey refused to listen to any explanation, but maintained they were\r\ngoing to call in the gentleman outside to rekindle Madame Lerat\xe2\x80\x99s fire.\r\n\r\nHowever, the gentleman over the way had gone off. The room grew calmer\r\nand the work was carried on in the sultry heat. When twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nstruck\xe2\x80\x94meal-time\xe2\x80\x94they all shook themselves. Nana, who had hastened to\r\nthe window again, volunteered to do the errands if they liked. And\r\nLeonie ordered two sous worth of shrimps, Augustine a screw of fried\r\npotatoes, Lisa a bunch of radishes, Sophie a sausage. Then as Nana was\r\ndoing down the stairs, Madame Lerat, who found her partiality for the\r\nwindow that morning rather curious, overtook her with her long legs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you. I want to buy something\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in the passage below she perceived the gentleman, stuck there like\r\na candle and exchanging glances with Nana. The girl flushed very red,\r\nwhereupon her aunt at once caught her by the arm and made her trot over\r\nthe pavement, whilst the individual followed behind. Ah! so the tom cat\r\nhad come for Nana. Well, that _was_ nice! At fifteen years and a half\r\nto have men trailing after her! Then Madame Lerat hastily began to\r\nquestion her. _Mon Dieu!_ Nana didn\xe2\x80\x99t know; he had only been following\r\nher for five days, but she could not poke her nose out of doors without\r\nstumbling on men. She believed he was in business; yes, a manufacturer\r\nof bone buttons. Madame Lerat was greatly impressed. She turned round\r\nand glanced at the gentleman out of the corner of her eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can see he\xe2\x80\x99s got a deep purse,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\r\nkitten; you must tell me everything. You have nothing more to fear\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking they hastened from shop to shop\xe2\x80\x94to the pork butcher\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthe fruiterer\xe2\x80\x99s, the cook-shop; and the errands in greasy paper were\r\npiled up in their hands. Still they remained amiable, flouncing along\r\nand casting bright glances behind them with gusts of gay laughter.\r\nMadame Lerat herself was acting the young girl, on account of the\r\nbutton manufacturer who was still following them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very distinguished looking,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared as they returned into\r\nthe passage. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he only has honorable views\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, as they were going up the stairs she suddenly seemed to remember\r\nsomething. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, tell me what the girls were whispering to each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94you know, what Sophie said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana did not make any ceremony. Only she caught Madame Lerat by the\r\nhand, and caused her to descend a couple of steps, for, really, it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do to say it aloud, not even on the stairs. When she whispered\r\nit to her, it was so obscene that Madame Lerat could only shake her\r\nhead, opening her eyes wide, and pursing her lips. Well, at least her\r\ncuriosity wasn\xe2\x80\x99t troubling her any longer.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth Madame Lerat regaled herself with her niece\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nlove adventure. She no longer left her, but accompanied her morning and\r\nevening, bringing her responsibility well to the fore. This somewhat\r\nannoyed Nana, but all the same she expanded with pride at seeing\r\nherself guarded like a treasure; and the talk she and her aunt indulged\r\nin in the street with the button manufacturer behind them flattered\r\nher, and rather quickened her desire for new flirtations. Oh! her aunt\r\nunderstood the feelings of the heart; she even compassionated the\r\nbutton manufacturer, this elderly gentleman, who looked so respectable,\r\nfor, after all, sentimental feelings are more deeply rooted among\r\npeople of a certain age. Still she watched. And, yes, he would have to\r\npass over her body before stealing her niece.\r\n\r\nOne evening she approached the gentleman, and told him, as straight as\r\na bullet, that his conduct was most improper. He bowed to her politely\r\nwithout answering, like an old satyr who was accustomed to hear parents\r\ntell him to go about his business. She really could not be cross with\r\nhim, he was too well mannered.\r\n\r\nThen came lectures on love, allusions to dirty blackguards of men, and\r\nall sorts of stories about hussies who had repented of flirtations,\r\nwhich left Nana in a state of pouting, with eyes gleaming brightly in\r\nher pale face.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere the button\r\nmanufacturer ventured to poke his nose between the aunt and the niece\r\nto whisper some things which ought not to have been said. Thereupon\r\nMadame Lerat was so frightened that she declared she no longer felt\r\nable to handle the matter and she told the whole business to her\r\nbrother. Then came another row. There were some pretty rumpuses in the\r\nCoupeaus\xe2\x80\x99 room. To begin with, the zinc-worker gave Nana a hiding. What\r\nwas that he learnt? The hussy was flirting with old men. All right.\r\nOnly let her be caught philandering out of doors again, she\xe2\x80\x99d be done\r\nfor; he, her father, would cut off her head in a jiffy. Had the like\r\never been seen before! A dirty nose who thought of beggaring her\r\nfamily! Thereupon he shook her, declaring in God\xe2\x80\x99s name that she\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nto walk straight, for he\xe2\x80\x99d watch her himself in future. He now looked\r\nher over every night when she came in, even going so far as to sniff at\r\nher and make her turn round before him.\r\n\r\nOne evening she got another hiding because he discovered a mark on her\r\nneck that he maintained was the mark of a kiss. Nana insisted it was a\r\nbruise that Leonie had given her when they were having a bit of a\r\nrough-house. Yet at other times her father would tease her, saying she\r\nwas certainly a choice morsel for men. Nana began to display the sullen\r\nsubmissiveness of a trapped animal. She was raging inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you leave her alone?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gervaise, who was more\r\nreasonable. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will end by making her wish to do it by talking to her\r\nabout it so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh! yes, indeed, she did wish to do it. She itched all over, longing to\r\nbreak loose and gad all the time, as father Coupeau said. He insisted\r\nso much on the subject that even an honest girl would have fired up.\r\nEven when he was abusing her, he taught her a few things she did not\r\nknow as yet, which, to say the least was astonishing. Then, little by\r\nlittle she acquired some singular habits. One morning he noticed her\r\nrummaging in a paper bag and rubbing something on her face. It was rice\r\npowder, which she plastered on her delicate satin-like skin with\r\nperverse taste. He caught up the paper bag and rubbed it over her face\r\nviolently enough to graze her skin and called her a miller\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\nOn another occasion she brought some ribbon home, to do up her old\r\nblack hat which she was so ashamed of. He asked her in a furious voice\r\nwhere she had got those ribbons from. Had she earned them by lying on\r\nher back or had she bagged them somewhere? A hussy or a thief, and\r\nperhaps both by now?\r\n\r\nMore than once he found her with some pretty little doodad. She had\r\nfound a little interlaced heart in the street on Rue d\xe2\x80\x99Aboukir. Her\r\nfather crushed the heart under his foot, driving her to the verge of\r\nthrowing herself at him to ruin something of his. For two years she had\r\nbeen longing for one of those hearts, and now he had smashed it! This\r\nwas too much, she was reaching the end of the line with him.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was often in the wrong in the manner in which he tried to rule\r\nNana. His injustice exasperated her. She at last left off attending the\r\nworkshop and when the zinc-worker gave her a hiding, she declared she\r\nwould not return to Titreville\xe2\x80\x99s again, for she was always placed next\r\nto Augustine, who must have swallowed her feet to have such a foul\r\nbreath. Then Coupeau took her himself to the Rue du Caire and requested\r\nthe mistress of the establishment to place her always next to\r\nAugustine, by way of punishment. Every morning for a fortnight he took\r\nthe trouble to come down from the Barriere Poissonniere to escort Nana\r\nto the door of the flower shop. And he remained for five minutes on the\r\nfootway, to make sure that she had gone in. But one morning while he\r\nwas drinking a glass with a friend in a wineshop in the Rue\r\nSaint-Denis, he perceived the hussy darting down the street. For a\r\nfortnight she had been deceiving him; instead of going into the\r\nworkroom, she climbed a story higher, and sat down on the stairs,\r\nwaiting till he had gone off. When Coupeau began casting the blame on\r\nMadame Lerat, the latter flatly replied that she would not accept it.\r\nShe had told her niece all she ought to tell her, to keep her on her\r\nguard against men, and it was not her fault if the girl still had a\r\nliking for the nasty beasts. Now, she washed her hands of the whole\r\nbusiness; she swore she would not mix up in it, for she knew what she\r\nknew about scandalmongers in her own family, yes, certain persons who\r\nhad the nerve to accuse her of going astray with Nana and finding an\r\nindecent pleasure in watching her take her first misstep. Then Coupeau\r\nfound out from the proprietress that Nana was being corrupted by that\r\nlittle floozie Leonie, who had given up flower-making to go on the\r\nstreet. Nana was being tempted by the jingle of cash and the lure of\r\nadventure on the streets.\r\n\r\nIn the tenement in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, Nana\xe2\x80\x99s old fellow was\r\ntalked about as a gentleman everyone was acquainted with. Oh! he\r\nremained very polite, even a little timid, but awfully obstinate and\r\npatient, following her ten paces behind like an obedient poodle.\r\nSometimes, indeed, he ventured into the courtyard. One evening, Madame\r\nGaudron met him on the second floor landing, and he glided down\r\nalongside the balusters with his nose lowered and looking as if on\r\nfire, but frightened. The Lorilleuxs threatened to move out if that\r\nwayward niece of theirs brought men trailing in after her. It was\r\ndisgusting. The staircase was full of them. The Boches said that they\r\nfelt sympathy for the old gentleman because he had fallen for a tramp.\r\nHe was really a respectable businessman, they had seen his button\r\nfactory on the Boulevard de la Villette. He would be an excellent catch\r\nfor a decent girl.\r\n\r\nFor the first month Nana was greatly amused with her old flirt. You\r\nshould have seen him always dogging her\xe2\x80\x94a perfect great nuisance, who\r\nfollowed far behind, in the crowd, without seeming to do so. And his\r\nlegs! Regular lucifers. No more moss on his pate, only four straight\r\nhairs falling on his neck, so that she was always tempted to ask him\r\nwhere his hairdresser lived. Ah! what an old gaffer, he was comical and\r\nno mistake, nothing to get excited over.\r\n\r\nThen, on finding him always behind her, she no longer thought him so\r\nfunny. She became afraid of him and would have called out if he had\r\napproached her. Often, when she stopped in front of a jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\nshe heard him stammering something behind her. And what he said was\r\ntrue; she would have liked to have had a cross with a velvet neck-band,\r\nor a pair of coral earrings, so small you would have thought they were\r\ndrops of blood.\r\n\r\nMore and more, as she plodded through the mire of the streets, getting\r\nsplashed by passing vehicles and being dazzled by the magnificence of\r\nthe window displays, she felt longings that tortured her like hunger\r\npangs, yearnings for better clothes, for eating in restaurants, for\r\ngoing to the theatre, for a room of her own with nice furniture. Right\r\nat those moments, it never failed that her old gentleman would come up\r\nto whisper something in her ear. Oh, if only she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of him,\r\nhow readily she would have taken up with him.\r\n\r\nWhen the winter arrived, life became impossible at home. Nana had her\r\nhiding every night. When her father was tired of beating her, her\r\nmother smacked her to teach her how to behave. And there were\r\nfree-for-alls; as soon as one of them began to beat her, the other took\r\nher part, so that all three of them ended by rolling on the floor in\r\nthe midst of the broken crockery. And with all this, there were short\r\nrations and they shivered with cold. Whenever the girl bought anything\r\npretty, a bow or a pair of buttons, her parents confiscated the\r\npurchase and drank what they could get for it. She had nothing of her\r\nown, excepting her allowance of blows, before coiling herself up\r\nbetween the rags of a sheet, where she shivered under her little black\r\nskirt, which she stretched out by way of a blanket. No, that cursed\r\nlife could not continue; she was not going to leave her skin in it. Her\r\nfather had long since ceased to count for her; when a father gets drunk\r\nlike hers did, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t a father, but a dirty beast one longs to be rid\r\nof. And now, too, her mother was doing down the hill in her esteem. She\r\ndrank as well. She liked to go and fetch her husband at Pere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nso as to be treated; and she willingly sat down, with none of the air\r\nof disgust that she had assumed on the first occasion, draining glasses\r\nindeed at one gulp, dragging her elbows over the table for hours and\r\nleaving the place with her eyes starting out of her head.\r\n\r\nWhen Nana passed in front of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir and saw her mother inside,\r\nwith her nose in her glass, fuddled in the midst of the disputing men,\r\nshe was seized with anger; for youth which has other dainty thoughts\r\nuppermost does not understand drink. On these evenings it was a pretty\r\nsight. Father drunk, mother drunk, a hell of a home that stunk with\r\nliquor, and where there was no bread. To tell the truth, a saint would\r\nnot have stayed in the place. So much the worse if she flew the coop\r\none of these days; her parents would have to say their _mea culpa_, and\r\nown that they had driven her out themselves.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday when Nana came home she found her father and her mother in\r\na lamentable condition. Coupeau, who had fallen across the bed was\r\nsnoring. Gervaise, crouching on a chair was swaying her head, with her\r\neyes vaguely and threateningly staring into vacancy. She had forgotten\r\nto warm the dinner, the remains of a stew. A tallow dip which she\r\nneglected to snuff revealed the shameful misery of their hovel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you, shrimp?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, your father will\r\ntake care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana did not answer, but remained pale, looking at the cold stove, the\r\ntable on which no plates were laid, the lugubrious hovel which this\r\npair of drunkards invested with the pale horror of their callousness.\r\nShe did not take off her hat but walked round the room; then with her\r\nteeth tightly set, she opened the door and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are doing down again?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her mother, who was unable even to\r\nturn her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten something. I shall come up again. Good evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she did not return. On the morrow when the Coupeaus were sobered\r\nthey fought together, reproaching each other with being the cause of\r\nNana\xe2\x80\x99s flight. Ah! she was far away if she were running still! As\r\nchildren are told of sparrows, her parents might set a pinch of salt on\r\nher tail, and then perhaps they would catch her. It was a great blow,\r\nand crushed Gervaise, for despite the impairment of her faculties, she\r\nrealized perfectly well that her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct lowered her\r\nstill more; she was alone now, with no child to think about, able to\r\nlet herself sink as low as she could fall. She drank steadily for three\r\ndays. Coupeau prowled along the exterior Boulevards without seeing Nana\r\nand then came home to smoke his pipe peacefully. He was always back in\r\ntime for his soup.\r\n\r\nIn this tenement, where girls flew off every month like canaries whose\r\ncages are left open, no one was astonished to hear of the Coupeaus\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmishap. But the Lorilleuxs were triumphant. Ah! they had predicted that\r\nthe girl would reward her parents in this fashion. It was deserved; all\r\nartificial flower-girls went that way. The Boches and the Poissons also\r\nsneered with an extraordinary display and outlay of grief. Lantier\r\nalone covertly defended Nana. _Mon Dieu!_ said he, with his puritanical\r\nair, no doubt a girl who so left her home did offend her parents; but,\r\nwith a gleam in the corner of his eyes, he added that, dash it! the\r\ngirl was, after all, too pretty to lead such a life of misery at her\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Lorilleux, one day in the Boches\xe2\x80\x99 room,\r\nwhere the party were taking coffee; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, as sure as daylight,\r\nClump-clump sold her daughter. Yes she sold her, and I have proof of\r\nit! That old fellow, who was always on the stairs morning and night,\r\nwent up to pay something on account. It stares one in the face. They\r\nwere seen together at the Ambigu Theatre\xe2\x80\x94the young wench and her old\r\ntom cat. Upon my word of honor, they\xe2\x80\x99re living together, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nplain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey discussed the scandal thoroughly while finishing their coffee.\r\nYes, it was quite possible. Soon most of the neighborhood accepted the\r\nconclusion that Gervaise had actually sold her daughter.\r\n\r\nGervaise now shuffled along in her slippers, without caring a rap for\r\nanyone. You might have called her a thief in the street, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave turned round. For a month past she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t looked at Madame\r\nFauconnier\xe2\x80\x99s; the latter had had to turn her out of the place to avoid\r\ndisputes. In a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time she had successively entered the service\r\nof eight washerwomen; she only lasted two or three days in each place\r\nbefore she got the sack, so badly did she iron the things entrusted to\r\nher, careless and dirty, her mind failing to such a point that she\r\nquite forgot her own craft. At last realizing her own incapacity she\r\nabandoned ironing; and went out washing by the day at the wash-house in\r\nthe Rue Neuve, where she still jogged on, floundering about in the\r\nwater, fighting with filth, reduced to the roughest but simplest work,\r\na bit lower on the down-hill slopes. The wash-house scarcely beautified\r\nher. A real mud-splashed dog when she came out of it, soaked and\r\nshowing her blue skin. At the same time she grew stouter and stouter,\r\ndespite her frequent dances before the empty sideboard, and her leg\r\nbecame so crooked that she could no longer walk beside anyone without\r\nthe risk of knocking him over, so great indeed was her limp.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough when a woman falls to this point all her pride leaves\r\nher. Gervaise had divested herself of all her old self-respect,\r\ncoquetry and need of sentiment, propriety and politeness. You might\r\nhave kicked her, no matter where, she did not feel kicks for she had\r\nbecome too fat and flabby. Lantier had altogether neglected her; he no\r\nlonger escorted her or even bothered to give her a pinch now and again.\r\nShe did not seem to notice this finish of a long liaison slowly spun\r\nout, and ending in mutual insolence. It was a chore the less for her.\r\nEven Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy with Virginie left her quite calm, so great was\r\nher indifference now for all that she had been so upset about in the\r\npast. She would even have held a candle for them now.\r\n\r\nEveryone was aware that Virginie and Lantier were carrying on. It was\r\nmuch too convenient, especially with Poisson on duty every other night.\r\nLantier had thought of himself when he advised Virginie to deal in\r\ndainties. He was too much of a Provincial not to adore sugared things;\r\nand in fact he would have lived off sugar candy, lozenges, pastilles,\r\nsugar plums and chocolate. Sugared almonds especially left a little\r\nfroth on his lips so keenly did they tickle his palate. For a year he\r\nhad been living only on sweetmeats. He opened the drawers and stuffed\r\nhimself whenever Virginie asked him to mind the shop. Often, when he\r\nwas talking in the presence of five or six other people, he would take\r\nthe lid off a jar on the counter, dip his hand into it and begin to\r\nnibble at something sweet; the glass jar remained open and its contents\r\ndiminished. People ceased paying attention to it, it was a mania of his\r\nso he had declared. Besides, he had devised a perpetual cold, an\r\nirritation of the throat, which he always talked of calming.\r\n\r\nHe still did not work, for he had more and more important schemes than\r\never in view. He was contriving a superb invention\xe2\x80\x94the umbrella hat, a\r\nhat which transformed itself into an umbrella on your head as soon as a\r\nshower commenced to fall; and he promised Poisson half shares in the\r\nprofit of it, and even borrowed twenty franc pieces of him to defray\r\nthe cost of experiments. Meanwhile the shop melted away on his tongue.\r\nAll the stock-in-trade followed suit down to the chocolate cigars and\r\npipes in pink caramel. Whenever he was stuffed with sweetmeats and\r\nseized with a fit of tenderness, he paid himself with a last lick on\r\nthe groceress in a corner, who found him all sugar with lips which\r\ntasted like burnt almonds. Such a delightful man to kiss! He was\r\npositively becoming all honey. The Boches said he merely had to dip a\r\nfinger into his coffee to sweeten it.\r\n\r\nSoftened by this perpetual dessert, Lantier showed himself paternal\r\ntowards Gervaise. He gave her advice and scolded her because she no\r\nlonger liked to work. Indeed! A woman of her age ought to know how to\r\nturn herself round. And he accused her of having always been a glutton.\r\nNevertheless, as one ought to hold out a helping hand, even to folks\r\nwho don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it, he tried to find her a little work. Thus he had\r\nprevailed upon Virginie to let Gervaise come once a week to scrub the\r\nshop and the rooms. That was the sort of thing she understood and on\r\neach occasion she earned her thirty sous. Gervaise arrived on the\r\nSaturday morning with a pail and a scrubbing brush, without seeming to\r\nsuffer in the least at having to perform a dirty, humble duty, a\r\ncharwoman\xe2\x80\x99s work in the dwelling-place where she had reigned as the\r\nbeautiful fair-haired mistress. It was a last humiliation, the end of\r\nher pride.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday she had a hard job of it. It had rained for three days and\r\nthe customers seemed to have brought all the mud of the neighborhood\r\ninto the shop on the soles of their boots. Virginie was at the counter\r\ndoing the grand, with her hair well combed, and wearing a little white\r\ncollar and a pair of lace cuffs. Beside her, on the narrow seat covered\r\nwith red oil-cloth, Lantier did the dandy, looking for the world as if\r\nhe were at home, as if he were the real master of the place, and from\r\ntime to time he carelessly dipped his hand into a jar of peppermint\r\ndrops, just to nibble something sweet according to his habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Madame Coupeau!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Virginie, who was watching the\r\nscrubbing with compressed lips, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have left some dirt over there in\r\nthe corner. Scrub that rather better please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise obeyed. She returned to the corner and began to scrub again.\r\nShe bent double on her knees in the midst of the dirty water, with her\r\nshoulders protruding, her arms stiff and purple with cold. Her old\r\nskirt, fairly soaked, stuck to her figure. And there on the floor she\r\nlooked a dirty, ill-combed drab, the rents in her jacket showing her\r\npuffy form, her fat, flabby flesh which heaved, swayed and floundered\r\nabout as she went about her work; and all the while she perspired to\r\nsuch a point that from her moist face big drops of sweat fell on to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more elbow grease one uses, the more it shines,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lantier,\r\nsententiously, with his mouth full of peppermint drops.\r\n\r\nVirginie, who sat back with the demeanor of a princess, her eyes partly\r\nopen, was still watching the scrubbing, and indulging in remarks. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nlittle more on the right there. Take care of the wainscot. You know I\r\nwas not very well pleased last Saturday. There were some stains left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd both together, the hatter and the groceress assumed a more\r\nimportant air, as if they had been on a throne whilst Gervaise dragged\r\nherself through the black mud at their feet. Virginie must have enjoyed\r\nherself, for a yellowish flame darted from her cat\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and she\r\nlooked at Lantier with an insidious smile. At last she was revenged for\r\nthat hiding she had received at the wash-house, and which she had never\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nWhenever Gervaise ceased scrubbing, a sound of sawing could be heard\r\nfrom the back room. Through the open doorway, Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s profile stood\r\nout against the pale light of the courtyard. He was off duty that day\r\nand was profiting by his leisure time to indulge in his mania for\r\nmaking little boxes. He was seated at a table and was cutting out\r\narabesques in a cigar box with extraordinary care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Badingue!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lantier, who had given him this surname again,\r\nout of friendship. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall want that box of yours as a present for a\r\nyoung lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginie gave him a pinch and he reached under the counter to run his\r\nfingers like a creeping mouse up her leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman. \xe2\x80\x9cI was working for you, Auguste, in\r\nview of presenting you with a token of friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep your little memento!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nLantier with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hang it round my neck with a ribbon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, as if this thought brought another one to his memory,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI met Nana last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis news caused Gervaise such emotion that she sunk down in the dirty\r\nwater which covered the floor of the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered speechlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; as I was going down the Rue des Martyrs, I caught sight of a girl\r\nwho was on the arm of an old fellow in front of me, and I said to\r\nmyself: I know that shape. I stepped faster and sure enough found\r\nmyself face to face with Nana. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to pity her, she looked\r\nvery happy, with her pretty woolen dress on her back, a gold cross and\r\nan awfully pert expression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gervaise in a husky voice.\r\n\r\nLantier, who had finished the pastilles, took some barley-sugar out of\r\nanother jar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s sneaky,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe made a sign to me to follow her, with\r\nwonderful composure. Then she left her old fellow somewhere in a\r\ncafe\xe2\x80\x94oh a wonderful chap, the old bloke, quite used up!\xe2\x80\x94and she came\r\nand joined me under the doorway. A pretty little serpent, pretty, and\r\ndoing the grand, and fawning on you like a little dog. Yes, she kissed\r\nme, and wanted to have news of everyone\xe2\x80\x94I was very pleased to meet\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise for the third time. She drew herself together, and\r\nstill waited. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t her daughter had a word for her then? In the\r\nsilence Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s saw could be heard again. Lantier, who felt gay, was\r\nsucking his barley-sugar, and smacking his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if _I_ saw her, I should go over to the other side of the\r\nstreet,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Virginie, who had just pinched the hatter again\r\nmost ferociously. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t because you are there, Madame Coupeau, but\r\nyour daughter is rotten to the core. Why, every day Poisson arrests\r\ngirls who are better than she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise said nothing, nor did she move; her eyes staring into space.\r\nShe ended by jerking her head to and fro, as if in answer to her\r\nthoughts, whilst the hatter, with a gluttonous mien, muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a man wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind getting a bit of indigestion from that sort of\r\nrottenness. It\xe2\x80\x99s as tender as chicken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the grocer gave him such a terrible look that he had to pause and\r\nquiet her with some delicate attention. He watched the policeman, and\r\nperceiving that he had his nose lowered over his little box again, he\r\nprofited of the opportunity to shove some barley-sugar into Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth. Thereupon she laughed at him good-naturedly and turned all her\r\nanger against Gervaise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust make haste, eh? The work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do itself while you remain stuck\r\nthere like a street post. Come, look alive, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to flounder\r\nabout in the water till night time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she added hatefully in a lower tone: \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault if her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s gone and left her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo doubt Gervaise did not hear. She had begun to scrub the floor again,\r\nwith her back bent and dragging herself along with a frog-like motion.\r\nShe still had to sweep the dirty water out into the gutter, and then do\r\nthe final rinsing.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Lantier, who felt bored, raised his voice again: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow, Badingue,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI met your boss yesterday in the Rue de\r\nRivoli. He looked awfully down in the mouth. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t six months\xe2\x80\x99 life\r\nleft in his body. Ah! after all, with the life he leads\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was talking about the Emperor. The policeman did not raise his eyes,\r\nbut curtly answered: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were the Government you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so\r\nfat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear fellow, if I were the Government,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the hatter,\r\nsuddenly affecting an air of gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cthings would go on rather\r\nbetter, I give you my word for it. Thus, their foreign policy\xe2\x80\x94why, for\r\nsome time past it has been enough to make a fellow sweat. If I\xe2\x80\x94I who\r\nspeak to you\xe2\x80\x94only knew a journalist to inspire him with my ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was growing animated, and as he had finished crunching his\r\nbarley-sugar, he opened a drawer from which he took a number of\r\njujubes, which he swallowed while gesticulating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite simple. Before anything else, I should give Poland her\r\nindependence again, and I should establish a great Scandinavian state\r\nto keep the Giant of the North at bay. Then I should make a republic\r\nout of all the little German states. As for England, she\xe2\x80\x99s scarcely to\r\nbe feared; if she budged ever so little I should send a hundred\r\nthousand men to India. Add to that I should send the Sultan back to\r\nMecca and the Pope to Jerusalem, belaboring their backs with the butt\r\nend of a rifle. Eh? Europe would soon be clean. Come, Badingue, just\r\nlook here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused to take five or six jujubes in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake longer than to swallow these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he threw one jujube after another into his open mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor has another plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman, after reflecting\r\nfor a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the hatter. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what his plan is. All\r\nEurope is laughing at us. Every day the Tuileries footmen find your\r\nboss under the table between a couple of high society floozies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoisson rose to his feet. He came forward and placed his hand on his\r\nheart, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou hurt me, Auguste. Discuss, but don\xe2\x80\x99t involve\r\npersonalities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon Virginie intervened, bidding them stop their row. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a fig for Europe. How could two men, who shared everything else,\r\nalways be disputing about politics? For a minute they mumbled some\r\nindistinct words. Then the policeman, in view of showing that he\r\nharbored no spite, produced the cover of his little box, which he had\r\njust finished; it bore the inscription in marquetry: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Auguste, a\r\ntoken of friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d Lantier, feeling exceedingly flattered, lounged\r\nback and spread himself out so that he almost sat upon Virginie. And\r\nthe husband viewed the scene with his face the color of an old wall and\r\nhis bleared eyes fairly expressionless; but all the same, at moments\r\nthe red hairs of his moustaches stood up on end of their own accord in\r\na very singular fashion, which would have alarmed any man who was less\r\nsure of his business than the hatter.\r\n\r\nThis beast of a Lantier had the quiet cheek which pleases ladies. As\r\nPoisson turned his back he was seized with the idea of printing a kiss\r\non Madame Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s left eye. As a rule he was stealthily prudent, but\r\nwhen he had been disputing about politics he risked everything, so as\r\nto show the wife his superiority. These gloating caresses, cheekily\r\nstolen behind the policeman\xe2\x80\x99s back, revenged him on the Empire which\r\nhad turned France into a house of quarrels. Only on this occasion he\r\nhad forgotten Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s presence. She had just finished rinsing and\r\nwiping the shop, and she stood near the counter waiting for her thirty\r\nsous. However, the kiss on Virginie\xe2\x80\x99s eye left her perfectly calm, as\r\nbeing quite natural, and as part of a business she had no right to mix\r\nherself up in. Virginie seemed rather vexed. She threw the thirty sous\r\non to the counter in front of Gervaise. The latter did not budge but\r\nstood there waiting, still palpitating with the effort she had made in\r\nscrubbing, and looking as soaked and as ugly as a dog fished out of the\r\nsewer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you anything?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the hatter at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; you mean Nana. No, nothing else. What a\r\ntempting mouth she has, the little hussy! Real strawberry jam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise went off with her thirty sous in her hand. The holes in her\r\nshoes spat water forth like pumps; they were real musical shoes, and\r\nplayed a tune as they left moist traces of their broad soles along the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood the feminine tipplers of her own class now related\r\nthat she drank to console herself for her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct. She\r\nherself, when she gulped down her dram of spirits on the counter,\r\nassumed a dramatic air, and tossed the liquor into her mouth, wishing\r\nit would \xe2\x80\x9cdo\xe2\x80\x9d for her. And on the days when she came home boozed she\r\nstammered that it was all through grief. But honest folks shrugged\r\ntheir shoulders. They knew what that meant: ascribing the effects of\r\nthe peppery fire of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir to grief, indeed! At all events, she\r\nought to have called it bottled grief. No doubt at the beginning she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t digest Nana\xe2\x80\x99s flight. All the honest feelings remaining in her\r\nrevolted at the thought, and besides, as a rule a mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto have to think that her daughter, at that very moment, perhaps, is\r\nbeing familiarly addressed by the first chance comer. But Gervaise was\r\nalready too stultified with a sick head and a crushed heart, to think\r\nof the shame for long. With her it came and went. She remained\r\nsometimes for a week together without thinking of her daughter, and\r\nthen suddenly a tender or an angry feeling seized hold of her,\r\nsometimes when she had her stomach empty, at others when it was full, a\r\nfurious longing to catch Nana in some corner, where she would perhaps\r\nhave kissed her or perhaps have beaten her, according to the fancy of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nWhenever these thoughts came over her, Gervaise looked on all sides in\r\nthe streets with the eyes of a detective. Ah! if she had only seen her\r\nlittle sinner, how quickly she would have brought her home again! The\r\nneighborhood was being turned topsy-turvy that year. The Boulevard\r\nMagenta and the Boulevard Ornano were being pierced; they were doing\r\naway with the old Barriere Poissonniere and cutting right through the\r\nouter Boulevard. The district could not be recognized. The whole of one\r\nside of the Rue des Poissonniers had been pulled down. From the Rue de\r\nla Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or a large clearing could now be seen, a dash of sunlight\r\nand open air; and in place of the gloomy buildings which had hidden the\r\nview in this direction there rose up on the Boulevard Ornano a perfect\r\nmonument, a six-storied house, carved all over like a church, with\r\nclear windows, which, with their embroidered curtains, seemed\r\nsymbolical of wealth. This white house, standing just in front of the\r\nstreet, illuminated it with a jet of light, as it were, and every day\r\nit caused discussions between Lantier and Poisson.\r\n\r\nGervaise had several times had tidings of Nana. There are always ready\r\ntongues anxious to pay you a sorry compliment. Yes, she had been told\r\nthat the hussy had left her old gentleman, just like the inexperienced\r\ngirl she was. She had gotten along famously with him, petted, adored,\r\nand free, too, if she had only known how to manage the situation. But\r\nyouth is foolish, and she had no doubt gone off with some young rake,\r\nno one knew exactly where. What seemed certain was that one afternoon\r\nshe had left her old fellow on the Place de la Bastille, just for half\r\na minute, and he was still waiting for her to return. Other persons\r\nswore they had seen her since, dancing on her heels at the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Hall\r\nof Folly,\xe2\x80\x9d in the Rue de la Chapelle. Then it was that Gervaise took it\r\ninto her head to frequent all the dancing places of the neighborhood.\r\nShe did not pass in front of a public ball-room without going in.\r\nCoupeau accompanied her. At first they merely made the round of the\r\nroom, looking at the drabs who were jumping about. But one evening, as\r\nthey had some coin, they sat down and ordered a large bowl of hot wine\r\nin view of regaling themselves and waiting to see if Nana would turn\r\nup. At the end of a month or so they had practically forgotten her, but\r\nthey frequented the halls for their own pleasure, liking to look at the\r\ndancers. They would remain for hours without exchanging a word, resting\r\ntheir elbows on the table, stultified amidst the quaking of the floor,\r\nand yet no doubt amusing themselves as they stared with pale eyes at\r\nthe Barriere women in the stifling atmosphere and ruddy glow of the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nIt happened one November evening that they went into the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Hall of\r\nFolly\xe2\x80\x9d to warm themselves. Out of doors a sharp wind cut you across the\r\nface. But the hall was crammed. There was a thundering big swarm\r\ninside; people at all the tables, people in the middle, people up\r\nabove, quite an amount of flesh. Yes, those who cared for tripes could\r\nenjoy themselves. When they had made the round twice without finding a\r\nvacant table, they decided to remain standing and wait till somebody\r\nwent off. Coupeau was teetering on his legs, in a dirty blouse, with an\r\nold cloth cap which had lost its peak flattened down on his head. And\r\nas he blocked the way, he saw a scraggy young fellow who was wiping his\r\ncoat-sleeve after elbowing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Coupeau in a fury, as he took his pipe out of his black\r\nmouth. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you apologize? And you play the disgusted one? Just\r\nbecause a fellow wears a blouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man turned round and looked at the zinc-worker from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll just teach you, you scraggy young scamp,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Coupeau,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the blouse is the finest garment out; yes! the garment of work.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll wipe you if you like with my fists. Did one ever hear of such a\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94a ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-well insulting a workman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise tried to calm him, but in vain. He drew himself up in his\r\nrags, in full view, and struck his blouse, roaring: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchest under that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon the young man dived into the midst of the crowd, muttering:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dirty blackguard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau wanted to follow and catch him. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to let himself\r\nbe insulted by a fellow with a coat on. Probably it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even paid\r\nfor! Some second-hand toggery to impress a girl with, without having to\r\nfork out a centime. If he caught the chap again, he\xe2\x80\x99d bring him down on\r\nhis knees and make him bow to the blouse. But the crush was too great;\r\nthere was no means of walking. He and Gervaise turned slowly round the\r\ndancers; there were three rows of sightseers packed close together,\r\nwhose faces lighted up whenever any of the dancers showed off. As\r\nCoupeau and Gervaise were both short, they raised themselves up on\r\ntiptoe, trying to see something besides the chignons and hats that were\r\nbobbing about. The cracked brass instruments of the orchestra were\r\nfuriously thundering a quadrille, a perfect tempest which made the hall\r\nshake; while the dancers, striking the floor with their feet, raised a\r\ncloud of dust which dimmed the brightness of the gas. The heat was\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, at that velvet hat over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey raised themselves up on tiptoe. On the left hand there was an old\r\nblack velvet hat trimmed with ragged feathers bobbing about\xe2\x80\x94regular\r\nhearse\xe2\x80\x99s plumes. It was dancing a devil of a dance, this hat\xe2\x80\x94bouncing\r\nand whirling round, diving down and then springing up again. Coupeau\r\nand Gervaise lost sight of it as the people round about moved their\r\nheads, but then suddenly they saw it again, swaying farther off with\r\nsuch droll effrontery that folks laughed merely at the sight of this\r\ndancing hat, without knowing what was underneath it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Coupeau.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you recognize that head of hair?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Gervaise in a stifled\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cMay my head be cut off if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith one shove the zinc-worker made his way through the crowd. _Mon\r\nDieu!_ yes, it was Nana! And in a nice pickle too! She had nothing on\r\nher back but an old silk dress, all stained and sticky from having\r\nwiped the tables of boozing dens, and with its flounces so torn that\r\nthey fell in tatters round about. Not even a bit of a shawl over her\r\nshoulders. And to think that the hussy had had such an attentive,\r\nloving gentleman, and had yet fallen to this condition, merely for the\r\nsake of following some rascal who had beaten her, no doubt!\r\nNevertheless she had remained fresh and insolent, with her hair as\r\nfrizzy as a poodle\xe2\x80\x99s, and her mouth bright pink under that rascally hat\r\nof hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust wait a bit, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make her dance!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Coupeau.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, Nana was not on her guard. You should have seen how\r\nshe wriggled about! She twisted to the right and to the left, bending\r\ndouble as if she were going to break herself in two, and kicking her\r\nfeet as high as her partner\xe2\x80\x99s face. A circle had formed about her and\r\nthis excited her even more. She raised her skirts to her knees and\r\nreally let herself go in a wild dance, whirling and turning, dropping\r\nto the floor in splits, and then jigging and bouncing.\r\n\r\nCoupeau was trying to force his way through the dancers and was\r\ndisrupting the quadrille.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s my daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9clet me pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNana was now dancing backwards, sweeping the floor with her flounces,\r\nrounding her figure and wriggling it, so as to look all the more\r\ntempting. She suddenly received a masterly blow just on the right\r\ncheek. She raised herself up and turned quite pale on recognizing her\r\nfather and mother. Bad luck and no mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn him out!\xe2\x80\x9d howled the dancers.\r\n\r\nBut Coupeau, who had just recognized his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s cavalier as the\r\nscraggy young man in the coat, did not care a fig for what the people\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s us,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared. \xe2\x80\x9cEh? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it. So we catch you\r\nhere, and with a whipper-snapper, too, who insulted me a little while\r\nago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise, whose teeth were tight set, pushed him aside, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need of so much explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, stepping forward, she dealt Nana a couple of hearty cuffs. The\r\nfirst knocked the feathered hat on one side, and the second left a red\r\nmark on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s white cheek. Nana was too stupefied either to cry or\r\nresist. The orchestra continued playing, the crowd grew angry and\r\nrepeated savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cTurn them out! Turn them out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gervaise. \xe2\x80\x9cJust walk in front, and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntry to run off. You shall sleep in prison if you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scraggy young man had prudently disappeared. Nana walked ahead,\r\nvery stiff and still stupefied by her bad luck. Whenever she showed the\r\nlest unwillingness, a cuff from behind brought her back to the\r\ndirection of the door. And thus they went out, all three of them, amid\r\nthe jeers and banter of the spectators, whilst the orchestra finished\r\nplaying the finale with such thunder that the trombones seemed to be\r\nspitting bullets.\r\n\r\nThe old life began again. After sleeping for twelve hours in her\r\ncloset, Nana behaved very well for a week or so. She had patched\r\nherself a modest little dress, and wore a cap with the strings tied\r\nunder her chignon. Seized indeed with remarkable fervor, she declared\r\nshe would work at home, where one could earn what one liked without\r\nhearing any nasty work-room talk; and she procured some work and\r\ninstalled herself at a table, getting up at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning\r\non the first few days to roll her sprigs of violets. But when she had\r\ndelivered a few gross, she stretched her arms and yawned over her work,\r\nwith her hands cramped, for she had lost her knack of stem-rolling, and\r\nsuffocated, shut up like this at home after allowing herself so much\r\nopen air freedom during the last six months. Then the glue dried, the\r\npetals and the green paper got stained with grease, and the\r\nflower-dealer came three times in person to make a row and claim his\r\nspoiled materials.\r\n\r\nNana idled along, constantly getting a hiding from her father, and\r\nwrangling with her mother morning and night\xe2\x80\x94quarrels in which the two\r\nwomen flung horrible words at each other\xe2\x80\x99s head. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t last; the\r\ntwelfth day she took herself off, with no more luggage than her modest\r\ndress on her back and her cap perched over one ear. The Lorilleuxs, who\r\nhad pursed their lips on hearing of her return and repentance, nearly\r\ndied of laughter now. Second performance, eclipse number two, all\r\naboard for the train for Saint-Lazare, the prison-hospital for\r\nstreetwalkers! No, it was really too comical. Nana took herself off in\r\nsuch an amusing style. Well, if the Coupeaus wanted to keep her in the\r\nfuture, they must shut her up in a cage.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of other people the Coupeaus pretended they were very\r\nglad to be rid of the girl, though in reality they were enraged.\r\nHowever, rage can\xe2\x80\x99t last forever, and soon they heard without even\r\nblinking that Nana was seen in the neighborhood. Gervaise, who accused\r\nher of doing it to enrage them, set herself above the scandal; she\r\nmight meet her daughter on the street, she said; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\ndirty her hand to cuff her; yes, it was all over; she might have seen\r\nher lying in the gutter, dying on the pavement, and she would have\r\npassed by without even admitting that such a hussy was her own child.\r\n\r\nNana meanwhile was enlivening the dancing halls of the neighborhood.\r\nShe was known from the \xe2\x80\x9cBall of Queen Blanche\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Hall of\r\nFolly.\xe2\x80\x9d When she entered the \xe2\x80\x9cElysee-Montmartre,\xe2\x80\x9d folks climbed onto\r\nthe tables to see her do the \xe2\x80\x9csniffling crawfish\xe2\x80\x9d during the\r\npastourelle. As she had twice been turned out of the \xe2\x80\x9cChateau Rouge\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhall, she walked outside the door waiting for someone she knew to\r\nescort her inside. The \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Ball\xe2\x80\x9d on the outer Boulevard and the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrand Turk\xe2\x80\x9d in the Rue des Poissonniers, were respectable places where\r\nshe only went when she had some fine dress on. Of all the jumping\r\nplaces of the neighborhood, however, those she most preferred were the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHermitage Ball\xe2\x80\x9d in a damp courtyard and \xe2\x80\x9cRobert\xe2\x80\x99s Ball\xe2\x80\x9d in the Impasse\r\ndu Cadran, two dirty little halls, lighted up with a half dozen oil\r\nlamps, and kept very informally, everyone pleased and everyone free, so\r\nmuch so that the men and their girls kissed each other at their ease,\r\nin the dances, without being disturbed. Nana had ups and downs, perfect\r\ntransformations, now tricked out like a stylish woman and now all dirt.\r\nAh! she had a fine life.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions the Coupeaus fancied they saw her in some shady\r\ndive. They turned their backs and decamped in another direction so as\r\nnot to be obliged to recognize her. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to be laughed at\r\nby a whole dancing hall again for the sake of bringing such a dolt\r\nhome. One night as they were going to bed, however, someone knocked at\r\nthe door. It was Nana who matter-of-factly came to ask for a bed; and\r\nin what a state. _Mon Dieu!_ her head was bare, her dress in tatters,\r\nand her boots full of holes\xe2\x80\x94such a toilet as might have led the police\r\nto run her in, and take her off to the Depot. Naturally enough she\r\nreceived a hiding, and then she gluttonously fell on a crust of stale\r\nbread and went to sleep, worn out, with the last mouthful between her\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThen this sort of life continued. As soon as she was somewhat recovered\r\nshe would go off and not a sight or sound of her. Weeks or months would\r\npass and she would suddenly appear with no explanation. The Coupeaus\r\ngot used to these comings and goings. Well, as long as she didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave\r\nthe door open. What could you expect?\r\n\r\nThere was only one thing that really bothered Gervaise. This was to see\r\nher daughter come home in a dress with a train and a hat covered with\r\nfeathers. No, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stomach this display. Nana might indulge in\r\nriotous living if she chose, but when she came home to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s she\r\nought to dress like a workgirl. The dresses with trains caused quite a\r\nsensation in the house; the Lorilleuxs sneered; Lantier, whose mouth\r\nsneered, turned the girl round to sniff at her delicious aroma; the\r\nBoches had forbidden Pauline to associate with this baggage in her\r\nfrippery. And Gervaise was also angered by Nana\xe2\x80\x99s exhausted slumber,\r\nwhen after one of her adventures, she slept till noon, with her chignon\r\nundone and still full of hair pins, looking so white and breathing so\r\nfeebly that she seemed to be dead. Her mother shook her five or six\r\ntimes in the course of the morning, threatening to throw a jugful of\r\nwater over her. The sight of this handsome lazy girl, half naked and\r\nbesotted with wine, exasperated her, as she saw her lying there.\r\nSometimes Nana opened an eye, closed it again, and then stretched\r\nherself out all the more.\r\n\r\nOne day after reproaching her with the life she led and asking her if\r\nshe had taken on an entire battalion of soldiers, Gervaise put her\r\nthreat into execution to the extent of shaking her dripping hand over\r\nNana\xe2\x80\x99s body. Quite infuriated, the girl pulled herself up in the sheet,\r\nand cried out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough, mamma. It would be better not to talk of men. You did\r\nas you liked, and now I do the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! What!\xe2\x80\x9d stammered the mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I never spoke to you about it, for it didn\xe2\x80\x99t concern me; but you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t used to be very fussy. I often saw you when we lived at the shop\r\nsneaking off as soon as papa started snoring. So just shut up; you\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have set me the example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise remained pale, with trembling hands, turning round without\r\nknowing what she was about, whilst Nana, flattened on her breast,\r\nembraced her pillow with both arms and subsided into the torpor of her\r\nleaden slumber.\r\n\r\nCoupeau growled, no longer sane enough to think of launching out a\r\nwhack. He was altogether losing his mind. And really there was no need\r\nto call him an unprincipled father, for liquor had deprived him of all\r\nconsciousness of good and evil.\r\n\r\nNow it was a settled thing. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sober once in six months; then he\r\nwas laid up and had to go into the Sainte-Anne hospital; a pleasure\r\ntrip for him. The Lorilleuxs said that the Duke of Bowel-Twister had\r\ngone to visit his estates. At the end of a few weeks he left the\r\nasylum, repaired and set together again, and then he began to pull\r\nhimself to bits once more, till he was down on his back and needed\r\nanother mending. In three years he went seven times to Sainte-Anne in\r\nthis fashion. The neighborhood said that his cell was kept ready for\r\nhim. But the worst of the matter was that this obstinate tippler\r\ndemolished himself more and more each time so that from relapse to\r\nrelapse one could foresee the final tumble, the last cracking of this\r\nshaky cask, all the hoops of which were breaking away, one after the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he forgot to improve in appearance; a perfect ghost\r\nto look at! The poison was having terrible effects. By dint of imbibing\r\nalcohol, his body shrunk up like the embryos displayed in glass jars in\r\nchemical laboratories. When he approached a window you could see\r\nthrough his ribs, so skinny had he become. Those who knew his age, only\r\nforty years just gone, shuddered when he passed by, bent and unsteady,\r\nlooking as old as the streets themselves. And the trembling of his\r\nhands increased, the right one danced to such an extent, that sometimes\r\nhe had to take his glass between both fists to carry it to his lips.\r\nOh! that cursed trembling! It was the only thing that worried his\r\naddled brains. You could hear him growling ferocious insults against\r\nthose hands of his.\r\n\r\nThis last summer, during which Nana usually came home to spend her\r\nnights, after she had finished knocking about, was especially bad for\r\nCoupeau. His voice changed entirely as if liquor had set a new music in\r\nhis throat. He became deaf in one ear. Then in a few days his sight\r\ngrew dim, and he had to clutch hold of the stair railings to prevent\r\nhimself from falling. As for his health, he had abominable headaches\r\nand dizziness. All on a sudden he was seized with acute pains in his\r\narms and legs; he turned pale; was obliged to sit down, and remained on\r\na chair witless for hours; indeed, after one such attack, his arm\r\nremained paralyzed for the whole day. He took to his bed several times;\r\nhe rolled himself up and hid himself under the sheet, breathing hard\r\nand continuously like a suffering animal. Then the strange scenes of\r\nSainte-Anne began again. Suspicious and nervous, worried with a burning\r\nfever, he rolled about in a mad rage, tearing his blouse and biting the\r\nfurniture with his convulsed jaws; or else he sank into a great state\r\nof emotion, complaining like a child, sobbing and lamenting because\r\nnobody loved him. One night when Gervaise and Nana returned home\r\ntogether they were surprised not to find him in his bed. He had laid\r\nthe bolster in his place. And when they discovered him, hiding between\r\nthe bed and the wall, his teeth were chattering, and he related that\r\nsome men had come to murder him. The two women were obliged to put him\r\nto bed again and quiet him like a child.\r\n\r\nCoupeau knew only one remedy, to toss down a pint of spirits; a whack\r\nin his stomach, which set him on his feet again. This was how he\r\ndoctored his gripes of a morning. His memory had left him long ago, his\r\nbrain was empty; and he no sooner found himself on his feet than he\r\npoked fun at illness. He had never been ill. Yes, he had got to the\r\npoint when a fellow kicks the bucket declaring that he\xe2\x80\x99s quite well.\r\nAnd his wits were going a-wool-gathering in other respects too. When\r\nNana came home after gadding about for six weeks or so he seemed to\r\nfancy she had returned from doing some errand in the neighborhood.\r\nOften when she was hanging on an acquaintance\xe2\x80\x99s arm she met him and\r\nlaughed at him without his recognizing her. In short, he no longer\r\ncounted for anything; she might have sat down on him if she had been at\r\na loss for a chair.\r\n\r\nWhen the first frosts came Nana took herself off once more under the\r\npretence of going to the fruiterer\xe2\x80\x99s to see if there were any baked\r\npears. She scented winter and didn\xe2\x80\x99t care to let her teeth chatter in\r\nfront of the fireless stove. The Coupeaus had called her no good\r\nbecause they had waited for the pears. No doubt she would come back\r\nagain. The other winter she had stayed away three weeks to fetch her\r\nfather two sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of tobacco. But the months went by and the girl\r\ndid not show herself. This time she must have indulged in a hard\r\ngallop. When June arrived she did not even turn up with the sunshine.\r\nEvidently it was all over, she had found a new meal ticket somewhere or\r\nother. One day when the Coupeaus were totally broke they sold Nana\xe2\x80\x99s\r\niron bedstead for six francs, which they drank together at Saint-Ouen.\r\nThe bedstead had been in their way.\r\n\r\nOne morning in July Virginie called to Gervaise, who was passing by,\r\nand asked her to lend a hand in washing up, for Lantier had entertained\r\na couple of friends on the day before. And while Gervaise was cleaning\r\nup the plates and dishes, greasy with the traces of the spread, the\r\nhatter, who was still digesting in the shop, suddenly called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, I saw Nana the other day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVirginie, who was seated at the counter looking very careworn in front\r\nof the jars and drawers which were already three parts emptied, jerked\r\nher head furiously. She restrained herself so as not to say too much,\r\nbut really it was angering her. Lantier was seeing Nana often. Oh! she\r\nwas by no means sure of him; he was a man to do much worse than that,\r\nwhen a fancy for a woman came into his head. Madame Lerat, very\r\nintimate just then with Virginie, who confided in her, had that moment\r\nentered the shop, and hearing Lantier\xe2\x80\x99s remark, she pouted\r\nridiculously, and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, you saw her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in the street here,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hatter, who felt highly\r\nflattered, and began to laugh and twirl his moustaches. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was in a\r\ncarriage and I was floundering on the pavement. Really it was so, I\r\nswear it! There\xe2\x80\x99s no use denying it, the young fellows of position who\r\nare on friendly terms with her are terribly lucky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eyes had brightened and he turned towards Gervaise who was standing\r\nin the rear of the shop wiping a dish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she was in a carriage, and wore such a stylish dress! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrecognise her, she looked so much like a lady of the upper set, with\r\nher white teeth and her face as fresh as a flower. It was she who waved\r\nher glove to me. She has caught a count, I believe. Oh! she\xe2\x80\x99s launched\r\nfor good. She can afford to do without any of us; she\xe2\x80\x99s head over heels\r\nin happiness, the little beggar! What a love of a little kitten! No,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea what a little kitten she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise was still wiping the same plate, although it had long since\r\nbeen clean and shiny. Virginie was reflecting, anxious about a couple\r\nof bills which fell due on the morrow and which she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\npay; whilst Lantier, stout and fat, perspiring the sugar he fed off,\r\nventured his enthusiasm for well-dressed little hussies. The shop,\r\nwhich was already three parts eaten up, smelt of ruin. Yes, there were\r\nonly a few more burnt almonds to nibble, a little more barley-sugar to\r\nsuck, to clean the Poissons\xe2\x80\x99 business out. Suddenly, on the pavement\r\nover the way, he perceived the policeman, who was on duty, pass by all\r\nbuttoned up with his sword dangling by his side. And this made him all\r\nthe gayer. He compelled Virginie to look at her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cBadingue looks fine this morning! Just look,\r\nsee how stiff he walks. He must have stuck a glass eye in his back to\r\nsurprise people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise went back upstairs, she found Coupeau seated on the bed,\r\nin the torpid state induced by one of his attacks. He was looking at\r\nthe window-panes with his dim expressionless eyes. She sat herself down\r\non a chair, tired out, her hands hanging beside her dirty skirt; and\r\nfor a quarter of an hour she remained in front of him without saying a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had some news,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYour daughter\xe2\x80\x99s been seen.\r\nYes, your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s precious stylish and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any more need of you.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s awfully happy, she is! Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ I\xe2\x80\x99d give a great deal to\r\nbe in her place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau was still staring at the window-pane. But suddenly he raised\r\nhis ravaged face, and stammered with an idiotic laugh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my little lamb, I\xe2\x80\x99m not stopping you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not yet so bad\r\nlooking when you wash yourself. As folks say, however old a pot may be,\r\nit ends by finding its lid. And, after all, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care if it only\r\nbuttered our bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been the Saturday after quarter day, something like the\r\n12th or 13th of January\xe2\x80\x94Gervaise didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know. She was losing her\r\nwits, for it was centuries since she had had anything warm in her\r\nstomach. Ah! what an infernal week! A complete clear out. Two loaves of\r\nfour pounds each on Tuesday, which had lasted till Thursday; then a dry\r\ncrust found the night before, and finally not a crumb for thirty-six\r\nhours, a real dance before the cupboard! What did she know, by the way,\r\nwhat she felt on her back, was the frightful cold, a black cold, the\r\nsky as grimy as a frying-pan, thick with snow which obstinately refused\r\nto fall. When winter and hunger are both together in your guts, you may\r\ntighten your belt as much as you like, it hardly feeds you.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Coupeau would bring back some money in the evening. He said\r\nthat he was working. Anything is possible, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And Gervaise,\r\nalthough she had been caught many and many a time, had ended by relying\r\non this coin. After all sorts of incidents, she herself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\nas much as a duster to wash in the whole neighborhood; and even an old\r\nlady, whose rooms she did, had just given her the sack, charging her\r\nwith swilling her liqueurs. No one would engage her, she was washed up\r\neverywhere; and this secretly suited her, for she had fallen to that\r\nstate of indifference when one prefers to croak rather than move one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfingers. At all events, if Coupeau brought his pay home they would have\r\nsomething warm to eat. And meanwhile, as it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet noon, she\r\nremained stretched on the mattress, for one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so cold or so\r\nhungry when one is lying down.\r\n\r\nThe bed was nothing but a pile of straw in a corner. Bed and bedding\r\nhad gone, piece by piece, to the second-hand dealers of the\r\nneighborhood. First she had ripped open the mattress to sell handfuls\r\nof wool at ten sous a pound. When the mattress was empty she got thirty\r\nsous for the sack so as to be able to have coffee. Everything else had\r\nfollowed. Well, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the straw good enough for them?\r\n\r\nGervaise bent herself like a gun-trigger on the heap of straw, with her\r\nclothes on and her feet drawn up under her rag of a skirt, so as to\r\nkeep them warm. And huddled up, with her eyes wide open, she turned\r\nsome scarcely amusing ideas over in her mind that morning. Ah! no, they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t continue living without food. She no longer felt her hunger,\r\nonly she had a leaden weight on her chest and her brain seemed empty.\r\nCertainly there was nothing gay to look at in the four corners of the\r\nhovel. A perfect kennel now, where greyhounds, who wear wrappers in the\r\nstreets, would not even have lived in effigy. Her pale eyes stared at\r\nthe bare walls. Everything had long since gone to \xe2\x80\x9cuncle\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d All that\r\nremained were the chest of drawers, the table and a chair. Even the\r\nmarble top of the chest of drawers and the drawers themselves, had\r\nevaporated in the same direction as the bedstead. A fire could not have\r\ncleaned them out more completely; the little knick-knacks had melted,\r\nbeginning with the ticker, a twelve franc watch, down to the family\r\nphotos, the frames of which had been bought by a woman keeping a\r\nsecond-hand store; a very obliging woman, by the way, to whom Gervaise\r\ncarried a saucepan, an iron, a comb and who gave her five, three or two\r\nsous in exchange, according to the article; enough, at all events to go\r\nupstairs again with a bit of bread. But now there only remained a\r\nbroken pair of candle snuffers, which the woman refused to give her\r\neven a sou for.\r\n\r\nOh! if she could only have sold the rubbish and refuse, the dust and\r\nthe dirt, how speedily she would have opened shop, for the room was\r\nfilthy to behold! She only saw cobwebs in the corners and although\r\ncobwebs are good for cuts, there are, so far, no merchants who buy\r\nthem. Then turning her head, abandoning the idea of doing a bit of\r\ntrade, Gervaise gathered herself together more closely on her straw,\r\npreferring to stare through the window at the snow-laden sky, at the\r\ndreary daylight, which froze the marrow in her bones.\r\n\r\nWhat a lot of worry! Though, after all, what was the use of putting\r\nherself in such a state and puzzling her brains? If she had only been\r\nable to have a snooze. But her hole of a home wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go out of her\r\nmind. Monsieur Marescot, the landlord had come in person the day before\r\nto tell them that he would turn them out into the street if the two\r\nquarters\xe2\x80\x99 rent now overdue were not paid during the ensuing week. Well,\r\nso he might, they certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worse off on the pavement!\r\nFancy this ape, in his overcoat and his woolen gloves, coming upstairs\r\nto talk to them about rent, as if they had had a treasure hidden\r\nsomewhere!\r\n\r\nJust the same with that brute of a Coupeau, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come home now\r\nwithout beating her; she wished him in the same place as the landlord.\r\nShe sent them all there, wishing to rid herself of everyone, and of\r\nlife too. She was becoming a real storehouse for blows. Coupeau had a\r\ncudgel, which he called his ass\xe2\x80\x99s fan, and he fanned his old woman. You\r\nshould just have seen him giving her abominable thrashings, which made\r\nher perspire all over. She was no better herself, for she bit and\r\nscratched him. Then they stamped about in the empty room and gave each\r\nother such drubbings as were likely to ease them of all taste for bread\r\nfor good. But Gervaise ended by not caring a fig for these thwacks, not\r\nmore than she did for anything else. Coupeau might celebrate Saint\r\nMonday for weeks altogether, go off on the spree for months at a time,\r\ncome home mad with liquor, and seek to sharpen her as he said, she had\r\ngrown accustomed to it, she thought him tiresome, but nothing more. It\r\nwas on these occasions that she wished him somewhere else. Yes,\r\nsomewhere, her beast of a man and the Lorilleuxs, the Boches, and the\r\nPoissons too; in fact, the whole neighborhood, which she had such\r\ncontempt for. She sent all Paris there with a gesture of supreme\r\ncarelessness, and was pleased to be able to revenge herself in this\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nOne could get used to almost anything, but still, it is hard to break\r\nthe habit of eating. That was the one thing that really annoyed\r\nGervaise, the hunger that kept gnawing at her insides. Oh, those\r\npleasant little snacks she used to have. Now she had fallen low enough\r\nto gobble anything she could find.\r\n\r\nOn special occasions, she would get waste scraps of meat from the\r\nbutcher for four sous a pound. Blacked and dried out meat that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind a purchaser. She would mix this with potatoes for a stew. On other\r\noccasions, when she had some wine, she treated herself to a sop, a true\r\nparrot\xe2\x80\x99s pottage. Two sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of Italian cheese, bushels of white\r\npotatoes, quarts of dry beans, cooked in their own juice, these also\r\nwere dainties she was not often able to indulge in now. She came down\r\nto leavings from low eating dens, where for a sou she had a pile of\r\nfish-bones, mixed with the parings of moldy roast meat. She fell even\r\nlower\xe2\x80\x94she begged a charitable eating-house keeper to give her his\r\ncustomers\xe2\x80\x99 dry crusts, and she made herself a bread soup, letting the\r\ncrusts simmer as long as possible on a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s fire. On the days\r\nwhen she was really hungry, she searched about with the dogs, to see\r\nwhat might be lying outside the tradespeople\xe2\x80\x99s doors before the dustmen\r\nwent by; and thus at times she came across rich men\xe2\x80\x99s food, rotten\r\nmelons, stinking mackerel and chops, which she carefully inspected for\r\nfear of maggots.\r\n\r\nYes, she had come to this. The idea may be a repugnant one to\r\ndelicate-minded folks, but if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t chewed anything for three\r\ndays running, we should hardly see them quarreling with their stomachs;\r\nthey would go down on all fours and eat filth like other people. Ah!\r\nthe death of the poor, the empty entrails, howling hunger, the animal\r\nappetite that leads one with chattering teeth to fill one\xe2\x80\x99s stomach\r\nwith beastly refuse in this great Paris, so bright and golden! And to\r\nthink that Gervaise used to fill her belly with fat goose! Now the\r\nthought of it brought tears to her eyes. One day, when Coupeau bagged\r\ntwo bread tickets from her to go and sell them and get some liquor, she\r\nnearly killed him with the blow of a shovel, so hungered and so enraged\r\nwas she by this theft of a bit of bread.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a long contemplation of the pale sky, she had fallen\r\ninto a painful doze. She dreamt that the snow-laden sky was falling on\r\nher, so cruelly did the cold pinch. Suddenly she sprang to her feet,\r\nawakened with a start by a shudder of anguish. _Mon Dieu!_ was she\r\ngoing to die? Shivering and haggard she perceived that it was still\r\ndaylight. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the night ever come? How long the time seems when\r\nthe stomach is empty! Hers was waking up in its turn and beginning to\r\ntorture her. Sinking down on the chair, with her head bent and her\r\nhands between her legs to warm them, she began to think what they would\r\nhave for dinner as soon as Coupeau brought the money home: a loaf, a\r\nquart of wine and two platefuls of tripe in the Lyonnaise fashion.\r\nThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck by father Bazouge\xe2\x80\x99s clock. Yes, it was only three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Then she began to cry. She would never have strength enough to\r\nwait until seven. Her body swayed backwards and forwards, she\r\noscillated like a child nursing some sharp pain, bending herself double\r\nand crushing her stomach so as not to feel it. Ah! an accouchement is\r\nless painful than hunger! And unable to ease herself, seized with rage,\r\nshe rose and stamped about, hoping to send her hunger to sleep by\r\nwalking it to and fro like an infant. For half an hour or so, she\r\nknocked against the four corners of the empty room. Then, suddenly, she\r\npaused with a fixed stare. So much the worse! They might say what they\r\nliked; she would lick their feet if needs be, but she would go and ask\r\nthe Lorilleuxs to lend her ten sous.\r\n\r\nAt winter time, up these stairs of the house, the paupers\xe2\x80\x99 stairs,\r\nthere was a constant borrowing of ten sous and twenty sous, petty\r\nservices which these hungry beggars rendered each other. Only they\r\nwould rather have died than have applied to the Lorilleuxs, for they\r\nknew they were too tight-fisted. Thus Gervaise displayed remarkable\r\ncourage in going to knock at their door. She felt so frightened in the\r\npassage that she experienced the sudden relief of people who ring a\r\ndentist\xe2\x80\x99s bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the chainmaker in a sour voice.\r\n\r\nHow warm and nice it was inside. The forge was blazing, its white flame\r\nlighting up the narrow workroom, whilst Madame Lorilleux set a coil of\r\ngold wire to heat. Lorilleux, in front of his worktable, was perspiring\r\nwith the warmth as he soldered the links of a chain together. And it\r\nsmelt nice. Some cabbage soup was simmering on the stove, exhaling a\r\nsteam which turned Gervaise\xe2\x80\x99s heart topsy-turvy, and almost made her\r\nfaint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Madame Lorilleux, without even asking her to\r\nsit down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise did not answer for a moment. She had recently been on fairly\r\ngood terms with the Lorilleuxs, but she saw Boche sitting by the stove.\r\nHe seemed very much at home, telling funny stories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lorilleux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Coupeau?\xe2\x80\x9d Gervaise finally stammered at last. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought he was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chainmakers and the concierge sneered. No, for certain, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen Coupeau. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand treat often enough to interest Coupeau.\r\nGervaise made an effort and resumed, stuttering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because he promised to come home. Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s to bring me some\r\nmoney. And as I have absolute need of something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence followed. Madame Lorilleux was roughly fanning the fire of the\r\nstove; Lorilleux had lowered his nose over the bit of chain between his\r\nfingers, while Boche continued laughing, puffing out his face till it\r\nlooked like the full moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I only had ten sous,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Gervaise, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe silence persisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you lend me ten sous? Oh! I would return them to you this\r\nevening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMadame Lorilleux turned round and stared at her. Here was a wheedler\r\ntrying to get round them. To-day she asked them for ten sous, to-morrow\r\nit would be for twenty, and there would be no reason to stop. No,\r\nindeed; it would be a warm day in winter if they lent her anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know very well that we\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t any money! Look! There\xe2\x80\x99s the lining of my pocket. You can\r\nsearch us. If we could, it would be with a willing heart, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heart\xe2\x80\x99s always there,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Lorilleux. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly when one can\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise looked very humble and nodded her head approvingly. However,\r\nshe did not take herself off. She squinted at the gold, at the gold\r\ntied together hanging on the walls, at the gold wire the wife was\r\ndrawing out with all the strength of her little arms, at the gold links\r\nlying in a heap under the husband\xe2\x80\x99s knotty fingers. And she thought\r\nthat the least bit of this ugly black metal would suffice to buy her a\r\ngood dinner. The workroom was as dirty as ever, full of old iron, coal\r\ndust and sticky oil stains, half wiped away; but now, as Gervaise saw\r\nit, it seemed resplendent with treasure, like a money changer\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\nAnd so she ventured to repeat softly: \xe2\x80\x9cI would return them to you,\r\nreturn them without fail. Ten sous wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t inconvenience you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer heart was swelling with the effort she made not to own that she had\r\nhad nothing to eat since the day before. Then she felt her legs give\r\nway. She was frightened that she might burst into tears, and she still\r\nstammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be kind of you! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m reduced to that,\r\ngood Lord\xe2\x80\x94reduced to that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon the Lorilleuxs pursed their lips and exchanged covert\r\nglances. So Clump-clump was begging now! Well, the fall was complete.\r\nBut they did not care for that kind of thing by any means. If they had\r\nknown, they would have barricaded the door, for people should always be\r\non their guard against beggars\xe2\x80\x94folks who make their way into apartments\r\nunder a pretext and carry precious objects away with them; and\r\nespecially so in this place, as there was something worth while\r\nstealing. One might lay one\xe2\x80\x99s fingers no matter where, and carry off\r\nthirty or forty francs by merely closing the hands. They had felt\r\nsuspicious several times already on noticing how strange Gervaise\r\nlooked when she stuck herself in front of the gold. This time, however,\r\nthey meant to watch her. And as she approached nearer, with her feet on\r\nthe board, the chainmaker roughly called out, without giving any\r\nfurther answer to her question: \xe2\x80\x9cLook out, pest\xe2\x80\x94take care; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ncarrying some scraps of gold away on the soles of your shoes. One would\r\nthink you had greased them on purpose to make the gold stick to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise slowly drew back. For a moment she leant against a rack, and\r\nseeing that Madame Lorilleux was looking at her hands, she opened them\r\nand showed them, saying softly, without the least anger, like a fallen\r\nwomen who accepts anything:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have taken nothing; you can look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she went off, because the strong smell of the cabbage soup and\r\nthe warmth of the workroom made her feel too ill.\r\n\r\nAh! the Lorilleuxs did not detain her. Good riddance; just see if they\r\nopened the door to her again. They had seen enough of her face. They\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want other people\xe2\x80\x99s misery in their rooms, especially when that\r\nmisery was so well deserved. They reveled in their selfish delight at\r\nbeing seated so cozily in a warm room, with a dainty soup cooking.\r\nBoche also stretched himself, puffing with his cheeks still more and\r\nmore, so much, indeed, that his laugh really became indecent. They were\r\nall nicely revenged on Clump-clump, for her former manners, her blue\r\nshop, her spreads, and all the rest. It had all worked out just as it\r\nshould, proving where a love of showing-off would get you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that is the style now? Begging for ten sous,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Madame\r\nLorilleux as soon as Gervaise had gone. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit; I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend her ten\r\nsous, and no mistake, to go and get drunk with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise shuffled along the passage in her slippers, bending her back\r\nand feeling heavy. On reaching her door she did not open it\xe2\x80\x94her room\r\nfrightened her. It would be better to walk about, she would learn\r\npatience. As she passed by she stretched out her neck, peering into\r\nPere Bru\xe2\x80\x99s kennel under the stairs. There, for instance, was another\r\none who must have a fine appetite, for he had breakfasted and dined by\r\nheart during the last three days. However, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at home, there was\r\nonly his hole, and Gervaise felt somewhat jealous, thinking that\r\nperhaps he had been invited somewhere. Then, as she reached the\r\nBijards\xe2\x80\x99 she heard Lalie moaning, and, as the key was in the lock as\r\nusual, she opened the door and went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nThe room was very clean. One could see that Lalie had carefully swept\r\nit, and arranged everything during the morning. Misery might blow into\r\nthe room as much as it liked, carry off the chattels and spread all the\r\ndirt and refuse about. Lalie, however, came behind and tidied\r\neverything, imparting, at least, some appearance of comfort within. She\r\nmight not be rich, but you realized that there was a housewife in the\r\nplace. That afternoon her two little ones, Henriette and Jules, had\r\nfound some old pictures which they were cutting out in a corner. But\r\nGervaise was greatly surprised to see Lalie herself in bed, looking\r\nvery pale, with the sheet drawn up to her chin. In bed, indeed, then\r\nshe must be seriously ill!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Gervaise, feeling anxious.\r\n\r\nLalie no longer groaned. She slowly raised her white eyelids, and tried\r\nto compel her lips to smile, although they were convulsed by a shudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered very softly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, closing her eyes again, she added with an effort:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made myself too tired during the last few days, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m doing the\r\nidle; I\xe2\x80\x99m nursing myself, as you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut her childish face, streaked with livid stains, assumed such an\r\nexpression of anguish that Gervaise, forgetting her own agony, joined\r\nher hands and fell on her knees near the bed. For the last month she\r\nhad seen the girl clinging to the walls for support when she went\r\nabout, bent double indeed, by a cough which seemed to presage a coffin.\r\nNow the poor child could not even cough. She had a hiccough and drops\r\nof blood oozed from the corners of her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault if I hardly feel strong,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, as if\r\nrelieved. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tired myself to-day, trying to put things to rights.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tidy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? And I wanted to clean the windows as well,\r\nbut my legs failed me. How stupid! However, when one has finished one\r\ncan go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, then said, \xe2\x80\x9cPray, see if my little ones are not cutting\r\nthemselves with the scissors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then she relapsed into silence, trembling and listening to a heavy\r\nfootfall which was approaching up the stairs. Suddenly father Bijard\r\nbrutally opened the door. As usual he was far gone, and his eyes shone\r\nwith the furious madness imparted by the vitriol he had swallowed. When\r\nhe perceived Lalie in bed, he tapped on his thighs with a sneer, and\r\ntook the whip from where it hung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! by blazes, that\xe2\x80\x99s too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have a laugh.\r\nSo the cows lie down on their straw at noon now! Are you poking fun at\r\nme, you lazy beggar? Come, quick now, up you get!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he cracked the whip over the bed. But the child beggingly replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, papa, don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t strike me. I swear to you you will regret it.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t strike!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you jump up?\xe2\x80\x9d he roared still louder, \xe2\x80\x9cor else I\xe2\x80\x99ll tickle your\r\nribs! Jump up, you little hound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she softly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94do you understand? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise had sprung upon Bijard and torn the whip away from him. He\r\nstood bewildered in front of the bed. What was the dirty brat talking\r\nabout? Do girls die so young without even having been ill? Some excuse\r\nto get sugar out of him no doubt. Ah! he\xe2\x80\x99d make inquiries, and if she\r\nlied, let her look out!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see, it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I could I\r\navoided worrying you; but be kind now, and bid me good-bye, papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBijard wriggled his nose as if he fancied she was deceiving him. And\r\nyet it was true she had a singular look, the serious mien of a grown up\r\nperson. The breath of death which passed through the room in some\r\nmeasure sobered him. He gazed around like a man awakened from a long\r\nsleep, saw the room so tidy, the two children clean, playing and\r\nlaughing. And then he sank on to a chair stammering, \xe2\x80\x9cOur little\r\nmother, our little mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were the only words he could find to say, and yet they were very\r\ntender ones to Lalie, who had never been much spoiled. She consoled her\r\nfather. What especially worried her was to go off like this without\r\nhaving completely brought up the little ones. He would take care of\r\nthem, would he not? With her dying breath she told him how they ought\r\nto be cared for and kept clean. But stultified, with the fumes of drink\r\nseizing hold of him again, he wagged his head, watching her with an\r\nuncertain stare as she was dying. All kind of things were touched in\r\nhim, but he could find no more to say and he was too utterly burnt with\r\nliquor to shed a tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Lalie, after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cWe owe four francs and seven\r\nsous to the baker; you must pay that. Madame Gaudron borrowed an iron\r\nof ours, which you must get from her. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to make any soup\r\nthis evening, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some bread left and you can warm up the\r\npotatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTill her last rattle, the poor kitten still remained the little mother.\r\nSurely she could never be replaced! She was dying because she had had,\r\nat her age, a true mother\xe2\x80\x99s reason, because her breast was too small\r\nand weak for so much maternity. And if her ferocious beast of a father\r\nlost his treasure, it was his own fault. After kicking the mother to\r\ndeath, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he murdered the daughter as well? The two good angels\r\nwould lie in the pauper\xe2\x80\x99s grave and all that could be in store for him\r\nwas to kick the bucket like a dog in the gutter.\r\n\r\nGervaise restrained herself not to burst out sobbing. She extended her\r\nhands, desirous of easing the child, and as the shred of a sheet was\r\nfalling, she wished to tack it up and arrange the bed. Then the dying\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s poor little body was seen. Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ what misery! What\r\nwoe! Stones would have wept. Lalie was bare, with only the remnants of\r\na camisole on her shoulders by way of chemise; yes, bare, with the\r\ngrievous, bleeding nudity of a martyr. She had no flesh left; her bones\r\nseemed to protrude through the skin. From her ribs to her thighs there\r\nextended a number of violet stripes\xe2\x80\x94the marks of the whip forcibly\r\nimprinted on her. A livid bruise, moreover, encircled her left arm, as\r\nif the tender limb, scarcely larger than a lucifer, had been crushed in\r\na vise. There was also an imperfectly closed wound on her right leg,\r\nleft there by some ugly blow and which opened again and again of a\r\nmorning, when she went about doing her errands. From head to foot,\r\nindeed, she was but one bruise! Oh! this murdering of childhood; those\r\nheavy hands crushing this lovely girl; how abominable that such\r\nweakness should have such a weighty cross to bear! Again did Gervaise\r\ncrouch down, no longer thinking of tucking in the sheet, but\r\noverwhelmed by the pitiful sight of this martyrdom; and her trembling\r\nlips seemed to be seeking for words of prayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Coupeau,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the child, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith her little arms she tried to draw up the sheet again, ashamed as\r\nit were for her father. Bijard, as stultified as ever, with his eyes on\r\nthe corpse which was his own work, still wagged his head, but more\r\nslowly, like a worried animal might do.\r\n\r\nWhen she had covered Lalie up again, Gervaise felt she could not remain\r\nthere any longer. The dying girl was growing weaker and ceased\r\nspeaking; all that was left to her was her gaze\xe2\x80\x94the dark look she had\r\nhad as a resigned and thoughtful child and which she now fixed on her\r\ntwo little ones who were still cutting out their pictures. The room was\r\ngrowing gloomy and Bijard was working off his liquor while the poor\r\ngirl was in her death agonies. No, no, life was too abominable! How\r\nfrightful it was! How frightful! And Gervaise took herself off, and\r\nwent down the stairs, not knowing what she was doing, her head\r\nwandering and so full of disgust that she would willingly have thrown\r\nherself under the wheels of an omnibus to have finished with her own\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAs she hastened on, growling against cursed fate, she suddenly found\r\nherself in front of the place where Coupeau pretended that he worked.\r\nHer legs had taken her there, and now her stomach began singing its\r\nsong again, the complaint of hunger in ninety verses\xe2\x80\x94a complaint she\r\nknew by heart. However, if she caught Coupeau as he left, she would be\r\nable to pounce upon the coin at once and buy some grub. A short hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaiting at the utmost; she could surely stay that out, though she had\r\nsucked her thumbs since the day before.\r\n\r\nShe was at the corner of Rue de la Charbonniere and Rue de Chartres. A\r\nchill wind was blowing and the sky was an ugly leaden grey. The\r\nimpending snow hung over the city but not a flake had fallen as yet.\r\nShe tried stamping her feet to keep warm, but soon stopped as there was\r\nno use working up an appetite.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing amusing about. The few passers-by strode rapidly\r\nalong, wrapped up in comforters; naturally enough one does not care to\r\ntarry when the cold is nipping at your heels. However, Gervaise\r\nperceived four or five women who were mounting guard like herself\r\noutside the door of the zinc-works; unfortunate creatures of\r\ncourse\xe2\x80\x94wives watching for the pay to prevent it going to the dram-shop.\r\nThere was a tall creature as bulky as a gendarme leaning against the\r\nwall, ready to spring on her husband as soon as he showed himself. A\r\ndark little woman with a delicate humble air was walking about on the\r\nother side of the way. Another one, a fat creature, had brought her two\r\nbrats with her and was dragging them along, one on either hand, and\r\nboth of them shivering and sobbing. And all these women, Gervaise like\r\nthe others, passed and repassed, exchanging glances, but without\r\nspeaking to one another. A pleasant meeting and no mistake. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nneed to make friends to learn what number they lived at. They could all\r\nhang out the same sideboard, \xe2\x80\x9cMisery & Co.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to make one feel\r\neven colder to see them walk about in silence, passing each other in\r\nthis terrible January weather.\r\n\r\nHowever, nobody as yet left the zinc-works. But presently one workman\r\nappeared, then two, and then three, but these were no doubt decent\r\nfellows who took their pay home regularly, for they jerked their heads\r\nsignificantly as they saw the shadows wandering up and down. The tall\r\ncreature stuck closer than ever to the side of the door, and suddenly\r\nfell upon a pale little man who was prudently poking his head out. Oh!\r\nit was soon settled! She searched him and collared his coin. Caught, no\r\nmore money, not even enough to pay for a dram! Then the little man,\r\nlooking very vexed and cast down, followed his gendarme, weeping like a\r\nchild. The workmen were still coming out; and as the fat mother with\r\nthe two brats approached the door, a tall fellow, with a cunning look,\r\nwho noticed her, went hastily inside again to warn her husband; and\r\nwhen the latter arrived he had stuffed a couple of cart wheels away,\r\ntwo beautiful new five franc pieces, one in each of his shoes. He took\r\none of the brats on his arm, and went off telling a variety of lies to\r\nhis old woman who was complaining. There were other workmen also,\r\nmournful-looking fellows, who carried in their clinched fists the pay\r\nfor the three or five days\xe2\x80\x99 work they had done during a fortnight, who\r\nreproached themselves with their own laziness, and took drunkards\xe2\x80\x99\r\noaths. But the saddest thing of all was the grief of the dark little\r\nwoman, with the humble, delicate look; her husband, a handsome fellow,\r\ntook himself off under her very nose, and so brutally indeed that he\r\nalmost knocked her down, and she went home alone, stumbling past the\r\nshops and weeping all the tears in her body.\r\n\r\nAt last the defile finished. Gervaise, who stood erect in the middle of\r\nthe street, was still watching the door. The look-out seemed a bad one.\r\nA couple of workmen who were late appeared on the threshold, but there\r\nwere still no signs of Coupeau. And when she asked the workmen if\r\nCoupeau wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming, they answered her, being up to snuff, that he\r\nhad gone off by the back-door with Lantimeche. Gervaise understood what\r\nthis meant. Another of Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s lies; she could whistle for him if she\r\nliked. Then shuffling along in her worn-out shoes, she went slowly down\r\nthe Rue de la Charbonniere. Her dinner was going off in front of her,\r\nand she shuddered as she saw it running away in the yellow twilight.\r\nThis time it was all over. Not a copper, not a hope, nothing but night\r\nand hunger. Ah! a fine night to kick the bucket, this dirty night which\r\nwas falling over her shoulders!\r\n\r\nShe was walking heavily up the Rue des Poissonniers when she suddenly\r\nheard Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Yes, he was there in the Little Civet, letting\r\nMy-Boots treat him. That comical chap, My-Boots, had been cunning\r\nenough at the end of last summer to espouse in authentic fashion a lady\r\nwho, although rather advanced in years, had still preserved\r\nconsiderable traces of beauty. She was a lady-of-the-evening of the Rue\r\ndes Martyrs, none of your common street hussies. And you should have\r\nseen this fortunate mortal, living like a man of means, with his hands\r\nin his pockets, well clad and well fed. He could hardly be recognised,\r\nso fat had he grown. His comrades said that his wife had as much work\r\nas she liked among the gentlemen of her acquaintance. A wife like that\r\nand a country-house is all one can wish for to embellish one\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\nAnd so Coupeau squinted admiringly at My-Boots. Why, the lucky dog even\r\nhad a gold ring on his little finger!\r\n\r\nGervaise touched Coupeau on the shoulder just as he was coming out of\r\nthe little Civet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting; I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an empty stomach which is all I\r\never get from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he silenced her in a capital style, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, eh? Well, eat\r\nyour fist, and keep the other for to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe considered it highly improper to do the dramatic in other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence. What, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t worked, and yet the bakers kneaded bread all\r\nthe same. Did she take him for a fool, to come and try to frighten him\r\nwith her stories?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to turn thief?\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, in a dull voice.\r\n\r\nMy-Boots stroked his chin in conciliatory fashion. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforbidden,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when a woman knows how to handle herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Coupeau interrupted him to call out \xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, a woman always\r\nought to know how to handle herself, but his wife had always been a\r\nhelpless thing. It would be her fault if they died on the straw. Then\r\nhe relapsed into his admiration for My-Boots. How awfully fine he\r\nlooked! A regular landlord; with clean linen and swell shoes! They were\r\nno common stuff! His wife, at all events, knew how to keep the pot\r\nboiling!\r\n\r\nThe two men walked towards the outer Boulevard, and Gervaise followed\r\nthem. After a pause, she resumed, talking behind Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s back: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhungry; you know, I relied on you. You must find me something to\r\nnibble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, and she repeated, in a tone of despairing agony: \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthat all I get from you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ I\xe2\x80\x99ve no coin,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, turning round in a fury. \xe2\x80\x9cJust\r\nleave me alone, eh? Or else I\xe2\x80\x99ll hit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was already raising his fist. She drew back, and seemed to make up\r\nher mind. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you. I guess I can find a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe zinc-worker laughed at this. He pretended to make a joke of the\r\nmatter, and strengthened her purpose without seeming to do so. That was\r\na fine idea of hers, and no mistake! In the evening, by gaslight, she\r\nmight still hook a man. He recommended her to try the Capuchin\r\nrestaurant where one could dine very pleasantly in a small private\r\nroom. And, as she went off along the Boulevard, looking pale and\r\nfurious he called out to her: \xe2\x80\x9cListen, bring me back some dessert. I\r\nlike cakes! And if your gentleman is well dressed, ask him for an old\r\novercoat. I could use one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words ringing in her ears, Gervaise walked softly away. But\r\nwhen she found herself alone in the midst of the crowd, she slackened\r\nher pace. She was quite resolute. Between thieving and the other, well\r\nshe preferred the other; for at all events she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t harm any one.\r\nNo doubt it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t proper. But what was proper and what was improper\r\nwas sorely muddled together in her brain. When you are dying of hunger,\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t philosophize, you eat whatever bread turns up. She had gone\r\nalong as far as the Chaussee-Clignancourt. It seemed as if the night\r\nwould never come. However, she followed the Boulevards like a lady who\r\nis taking a stroll before dinner. The neighborhood in which she felt so\r\nashamed, so greatly was it being embellished, was now full of fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\nLost in the crowd on the broad footway, walking past the little plane\r\ntrees, Gervaise felt alone and abandoned. The vistas of the avenues\r\nseemed to empty her stomach all the more. And to think that among this\r\nflood of people there were many in easy circumstances, and yet not a\r\nChristian who could guess her position, and slip a ten sous piece into\r\nher hand! Yes, it was too great and too beautiful; her head swam and\r\nher legs tottered under this broad expanse of grey sky stretched over\r\nso vast a space. The twilight had the dirty-yellowish tinge of Parisian\r\nevenings, a tint that gives you a longing to die at once, so ugly does\r\nstreet life seem. The horizon was growing indistinct, assuming a\r\nmud-colored tinge as it were. Gervaise, who was already weary, met all\r\nthe workpeople returning home. At this hour of the day the ladies in\r\nbonnets and the well-dressed gentlemen living in the new houses mingled\r\nwith the people, with the files of men and women still pale from\r\ninhaling the tainted atmosphere of workshops and workrooms. From the\r\nBoulevard Magenta and the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere, came bands of\r\npeople, rendered breathless by their uphill walk. As the omnivans and\r\nthe cabs rolled by less noiselessly among the vans and trucks returning\r\nhome empty at a gallop, an ever-increasing swarm of blouses and blue\r\nvests covered the pavement. Commissionaires returned with their\r\ncrotchets on their backs. Two workmen took long strides side by side,\r\ntalking to each other in loud voices, with any amount of gesticulation,\r\nbut without looking at one another; others who were alone in overcoats\r\nand caps walked along the curbstones with lowered noses; others again\r\ncame in parties of five or six, following each other, with pale eyes\r\nand their hands in their pockets and not exchanging a word. Some still\r\nhad their pipes, which had gone out between their teeth. Four masons\r\npoked their white faces out of the windows of a cab which they had\r\nhired between them, and on the roof of which their mortar-troughs\r\nrocked to and fro. House-painters were swinging their pots; a\r\nzinc-worker was returning laden with a long ladder, with which he\r\nalmost poked people\xe2\x80\x99s eyes out; whilst a belated plumber, with his box\r\non his back, played the tune of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Good King Dagobert\xe2\x80\x9d on his little\r\ntrumpet. Ah! the sad music, a fitting accompaniment to the tread of the\r\nflock, the tread of the weary beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nSuddenly on raising her eyes she noticed the old Hotel Boncoeur in\r\nfront of her. After being an all-night cafe, which the police had\r\nclosed down, the little house was now abandoned; the shutters were\r\ncovered with posters, the lantern was broken, and the whole building\r\nwas rotting and crumbling away from top to bottom, with its smudgy\r\nclaret-colored paint, quite moldy. The stationer\xe2\x80\x99s and the\r\ntobacconist\xe2\x80\x99s were still there. In the rear, over some low buildings,\r\nyou could see the leprous facades of several five-storied houses\r\nrearing their tumble-down outlines against the sky. The \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Balcony\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndancing hall no longer existed; some sugar-cutting works, which hissed\r\ncontinually, had been installed in the hall with the ten flaming\r\nwindows. And yet it was here, in this dirty den\xe2\x80\x94the Hotel Boncoeur\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nthe whole cursed life had commenced. Gervaise remained looking at the\r\nwindow of the first floor, from which hung a broken shutter, and\r\nrecalled to mind her youth with Lantier, their first rows and the\r\nignoble way in which he had abandoned her. Never mind, she was young\r\nthen, and it all seemed gay to her, seen from a distance. Only twenty\r\nyears. _Mon Dieu!_ and yet she had fallen to street-walking. Then the\r\nsight of the lodging house oppressed her and she walked up the\r\nBoulevard in the direction of Montmartre.\r\n\r\nThe night was gathering, but children were still playing on the heaps\r\nof sand between the benches. The march past continued, the workgirls\r\nwent by, trotting along and hurrying to make up for the time they had\r\nlost in looking in at the shop windows; one tall girl, who had stopped,\r\nleft her hand in that of a big fellow, who accompanied her to within\r\nthree doors of her home; others as they parted from each other, made\r\nappointments for the night at the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Hall of Folly\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\r\nBall.\xe2\x80\x9d In the midst of the groups, piece-workmen went by, carrying\r\ntheir clothes folded under their arms. A chimney sweep, harnessed with\r\nleather braces, was drawing a cart along, and nearly got himself\r\ncrushed by an omnibus. Among the crowd which was now growing scantier,\r\nthere were several women running with bare heads; after lighting the\r\nfire, they had come downstairs again and were hastily making their\r\npurchases for dinner; they jostled the people they met, darted into the\r\nbakers\xe2\x80\x99 and the pork butchers\xe2\x80\x99, and went off again with all despatch,\r\ntheir provisions in their hands. There were little girls of eight years\r\nold, who had been sent out on errands, and who went along past the\r\nshops, pressing long loaves of four pounds\xe2\x80\x99 weight, as tall as they\r\nwere themselves, against their chests, as if these loaves had been\r\nbeautiful yellow dolls; at times these little ones forgot themselves\r\nfor five minutes or so, in front of some pictures in a shop window, and\r\nrested their cheeks against the bread. Then the flow subsided, the\r\ngroups became fewer and farther between, the working classes had gone\r\nhome; and as the gas blazed now that the day\xe2\x80\x99s toil was over, idleness\r\nand amusement seemed to wake up.\r\n\r\nAh! yes; Gervaise had finished her day! She was wearier even than all\r\nthis mob of toilers who had jostled her as they went by. She might lie\r\ndown there and croak, for work would have nothing more to do with her,\r\nand she had toiled enough during her life to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhose turn now? I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhad enough.\xe2\x80\x9d At present everyone was eating. It was really the end, the\r\nsun had blown out its candle, the night would be a long one. _Mon\r\nDieu!_ To stretch one\xe2\x80\x99s self at one\xe2\x80\x99s ease and never get up again; to\r\nthink one had put one\xe2\x80\x99s tools by for good and that one could ruminate\r\nlike a cow forever! That\xe2\x80\x99s what is good, after tiring one\xe2\x80\x99s self out\r\nfor twenty years! And Gervaise, as hunger twisted her stomach, thought\r\nin spite of herself of the fete days, the spreads and the revelry of\r\nher life. Of one occasion especially, an awfully cold day, a mid-Lent\r\nThursday. She had enjoyed herself wonderfully well. She was very\r\npretty, fair-haired and fresh looking at that time. Her wash-house in\r\nthe Rue Neuve had chosen her as queen in spite of her leg. And then\r\nthey had had an outing on the boulevards in carts decked with greenery,\r\nin the midst of stylish people who ogled her. Real gentlemen put up\r\ntheir glasses as if she had been a true queen. In the evening there was\r\na wonderful spread, and then they had danced till daylight. Queen; yes\r\nQueen! With a crown and a sash for twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x94twice round the\r\nclock! And now oppressed by hunger, she looked on the ground, as if she\r\nwere seeking for the gutter in which she had let her fallen majesty\r\ntumble.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes again. She was in front of the slaughter-houses\r\nwhich were being pulled down; through the gaps in the facade one could\r\nsee the dark, stinking courtyards, still damp with blood. And when she\r\nhad gone down the Boulevard again, she also saw the Lariboisiere\r\nHospital, with its long grey wall, above which she could distinguish\r\nthe mournful, fan-like wings, pierced with windows at even distances. A\r\ndoor in the wall filled the neighborhood with dread; it was the door of\r\nthe dead in solid oak, and without a crack, as stern and as silent as a\r\ntombstone. Then to escape her thoughts, she hurried further down till\r\nshe reached the railway bridge. The high parapets of riveted sheet-iron\r\nhid the line from view; she could only distinguish a corner of the\r\nstation standing out against the luminous horizon of Paris, with a vast\r\nroof black with coal-dust. Through the clear space she could hear the\r\nengines whistling and the cars being shunted, in token of colossal\r\nhidden activity. Then a train passed by, leaving Paris, with puffing\r\nbreath and a growing rumble. And all she perceived of this train was a\r\nwhite plume, a sudden gust of steam which rose above the parapet and\r\nthen evaporated. But the bridge had shaken, and she herself seemed\r\nimpressed by this departure at full speed. She turned round as if to\r\nfollow the invisible engine, the noise of which was dying away.\r\n\r\nShe caught a glimpse of open country through a gap between tall\r\nbuildings. Oh, if only she could have taken a train and gone away, far\r\naway from this poverty and suffering. She might have started an\r\nentirely new life! Then she turned to look at the posters on the bridge\r\nsidings. One was on pretty blue paper and offered a fifty-franc reward\r\nfor a lost dog. Someone must have really loved that dog!\r\n\r\nGervaise slowly resumed her walk. In the smoky fog which was falling,\r\nthe gas lamps were being lighted up; and the long avenues, which had\r\ngrown bleak and indistinct, suddenly showed themselves plainly again,\r\nsparkling to their full length and piercing through the night, even to\r\nthe vague darkness of the horizon. A great gust swept by; the widened\r\nspaces were lighted up with girdles of little flames, shining under the\r\nfar-stretching moonless sky. It was the hour when, from one end of the\r\nBoulevard to the other, the dram-shops and the dancing-halls flamed\r\ngayly as the first glasses were merrily drunk and the first dance\r\nbegan. It was the great fortnightly pay-day, and the pavement was\r\ncrowded with jostling revelers on the spree. There was a breath of\r\nmerrymaking in the air\xe2\x80\x94deuced fine revelry, but not objectionable so\r\nfar. Fellows were filling themselves in the eating-houses; through the\r\nlighted windows you could see people feeding, with their mouths full\r\nand laughing without taking the trouble to swallow first. Drunkards\r\nwere already installed in the wineshops, squabbling and gesticulating.\r\nAnd there was a cursed noise on all sides, voices shouting amid the\r\nconstant clatter of feet on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, are you coming to sip?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMake haste, old man; I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for a\r\nglass of bottled wine.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Pauline! Shan\xe2\x80\x99t we just laugh!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ndoors swung to and fro, letting a smell of wine and a sound of cornet\r\nplaying escape into the open air. There was a gathering in front of\r\nPere Colombe\xe2\x80\x99s l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir, which was lighted up like a cathedral for\r\nhigh mass. _Mon Dieu!_ you would have said a real ceremony was going\r\non, for several capital fellows, with rounded paunches and swollen\r\ncheeks, looking for all the world like professional choristers, were\r\nsinging inside. They were celebrating Saint-Pay, of course\xe2\x80\x94a very\r\namiable saint, who no doubt keeps the cash box in Paradise. Only, on\r\nseeing how gaily the evening began, the retired petty tradesmen who had\r\ntaken their wives out for a stroll wagged their heads, and repeated\r\nthat there would be any number of drunken men in Paris that night. And\r\nthe night stretched very dark, dead-like and icy, above this revelry,\r\nperforated only with lines of gas lamps extending to the four corners\r\nof heaven.\r\n\r\nGervaise stood in front of l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir, thinking that if she had had a\r\ncouple of sous she could have gone inside and drunk a dram. No doubt a\r\ndram would have quieted her hunger. Ah! what a number of drams she had\r\ndrunk in her time! Liquor seemed good stuff to her after all. And from\r\noutside she watched the drunk-making machine, realizing that her\r\nmisfortune was due to it, and yet dreaming of finishing herself off\r\nwith brandy on the day she had some coin. But a shudder passed through\r\nher hair as she saw it was now almost dark. Well, the night time was\r\napproaching. She must have some pluck and sell herself coaxingly if she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to kick the bucket in the midst of the general revelry.\r\nLooking at other people gorging themselves didn\xe2\x80\x99t precisely fill her\r\nown stomach. She slackened her pace again and looked around her. There\r\nwas a darker shade under the trees. Few people passed along, only folks\r\nin a hurry, who swiftly crossed the Boulevards. And on the broad, dark,\r\ndeserted footway, where the sound of the revelry died away, women were\r\nstanding and waiting. They remained for long intervals motionless,\r\npatient and as stiff-looking as the scrubby little plane trees; then\r\nthey slowly began to move, dragging their slippers over the frozen\r\nsoil, taking ten steps or so and then waiting again, rooted as it were\r\nto the ground. There was one of them with a huge body and insect-like\r\narms and legs, wearing a black silk rag, with a yellow scarf over her\r\nhead; there was another one, tall and bony, who was bareheaded and wore\r\na servant\xe2\x80\x99s apron; and others, too\xe2\x80\x94old ones plastered up and young ones\r\nso dirty that a ragpicker would not have picked them up. However,\r\nGervaise tried to learn what to do by imitating them; girlish-like\r\nemotion tightened her throat; she was hardly aware whether she felt\r\nashamed or not; she seemed to be living in a horrible dream. For a\r\nquarter of an hour she remained standing erect. Men hurried by without\r\neven turning their heads. Then she moved about in her turn, and\r\nventuring to accost a man who was whistling with his hands in his\r\npockets, she murmured, in a strangled voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, listen a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man gave her a side glance and then went off, whistling all the\r\nlouder.\r\n\r\nGervaise grew bolder, and, with her stomach empty, she became absorbed\r\nin this chase, fiercely rushing after her dinner, which was still\r\nrunning away. She walked about for a long while, without thinking of\r\nthe flight of time or of the direction she took. Around her the dark,\r\nmute women went to and fro under the trees like wild beasts in a cage.\r\nThey stepped out of the shade like apparitions, and passed under the\r\nlight of a gas lamp with their pale masks fully apparent; then they\r\ngrew vague again as they went off into the darkness, with a white strip\r\nof petticoat swinging to and fro. Men let themselves be stopped at\r\ntimes, talked jokingly, and then started off again laughing. Others\r\nwould quietly follow a woman to her room, discreetly, ten paces behind.\r\nThere was a deal of muttering, quarreling in an undertone and furious\r\nbargaining, which suddenly subsided into profound silence. And as far\r\nas Gervaise went she saw these women standing like sentinels in the\r\nnight. They seemed to be placed along the whole length of the\r\nBoulevard. As soon as she met one she saw another twenty paces further\r\non, and the file stretched out unceasingly. Entire Paris was guarded.\r\nShe grew enraged on finding herself disdained, and changing her place,\r\nshe now perambulated between the Chaussee de Clignancourt and the Grand\r\nRue of La Chapelle. All were beggars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, just listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the men passed by. She started from the slaughter-houses, which\r\nstank of blood. She glanced on her way at the old Hotel Boncoeur, now\r\nclosed. She passed in front of the Lariboisiere Hospital, and\r\nmechanically counted the number of windows that were illuminated with a\r\npale quiet glimmer, like that of night-lights at the bedside of some\r\nagonizing sufferers. She crossed the railway bridge as the trains\r\nrushed by with a noisy rumble, rending the air in twain with their\r\nshrill whistling! Ah! how sad everything seemed at night-time! Then she\r\nturned on her heels again and filled her eyes with the sight of the\r\nsame houses, doing this ten and twenty times without pausing, without\r\nresting for a minute on a bench. No; no one wanted her. Her shame\r\nseemed to be increased by this contempt. She went down towards the\r\nhospital again, and then returned towards the slaughter-houses. It was\r\nher last promenade\xe2\x80\x94from the blood-stained courtyards, where animals\r\nwere slaughtered, down to the pale hospital wards, where death\r\nstiffened the patients stretched between the sheets. It was between\r\nthese two establishments that she had passed her life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, just listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she perceived her shadow on the ground. When she\r\napproached a gas-lamp it gradually became less vague, till it stood out\r\nat last in full force\xe2\x80\x94an enormous shadow it was, positively grotesque,\r\nso portly had she become. Her stomach, breast and hips, all equally\r\nflabby jostled together as it were. She walked with such a limp that\r\nthe shadow bobbed almost topsy-turvy at every step she took; it looked\r\nlike a real Punch! Then as she left the street lamp behind her, the\r\nPunch grew taller, becoming in fact gigantic, filling the whole\r\nBoulevard, bobbing to and fro in such style that it seemed fated to\r\nsmash its nose against the trees or the houses. _Mon Dieu!_ how\r\nfrightful she was! She had never realised her disfigurement so\r\nthoroughly. And she could not help looking at her shadow; indeed, she\r\nwaited for the gas-lamps, still watching the Punch as it bobbed about.\r\nAh! she had a pretty companion beside her! What a figure! It ought to\r\nattract the men at once! And at the thought of her unsightliness, she\r\nlowered her voice, and only just dared to stammer behind the\r\npassers-by:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, just listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now getting quite late. Matters were growing bad in the\r\nneighborhood. The eating-houses had closed and voices, gruff with\r\ndrink, could be heard disputing in the wineshops. Revelry was turning\r\nto quarreling and fisticuffs. A big ragged chap roared out, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll knock\r\nyer to bits; just count yer bones.\xe2\x80\x9d A large woman had quarreled with a\r\nfellow outside a dancing place, and was calling him \xe2\x80\x9cdirty blackguard\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9clousy bum,\xe2\x80\x9d whilst he on his side just muttered under his breath.\r\nDrink seemed to have imparted a fierce desire to indulge in blows, and\r\nthe passers-by, who were now less numerous, had pale contracted faces.\r\nThere was a battle at last; one drunken fellow came down on his back\r\nwith all four limbs raised in the air, whilst his comrade, thinking he\r\nhad done for him, ran off with his heavy shoes clattering over the\r\npavement. Groups of men sang dirty songs and then there would be long\r\nsilences broken only by hiccoughs or the thud of a drunk falling down.\r\n\r\nGervaise still hobbled about, going up and down, with the idea of\r\nwalking forever. At times, she felt drowsy and almost went to sleep,\r\nrocked, as it were, by her lame leg; then she looked round her with a\r\nstart, and noticed she had walked a hundred yards unconsciously. Her\r\nfeet were swelling in her ragged shoes. The last clear thought that\r\noccupied her mind was that her hussy of a daughter was perhaps eating\r\noysters at that very moment. Then everything became cloudy; and,\r\nalbeit, she remained with open eyes, it required too great an effort\r\nfor her to think. The only sensation that remained to her, in her utter\r\nannihilation, was that it was frightfully cold, so sharply, mortally\r\ncold, she had never known the like before. Why, even dead people could\r\nnot feel so cold in their graves. With an effort she raised her head,\r\nand something seemed to lash her face. It was the snow, which had at\r\nlast decided to fall from the smoky sky\xe2\x80\x94fine thick snow, which the\r\nbreeze swept round and round. For three days it had been expected and\r\nwhat a splendid moment it chose to appear.\r\n\r\nWoken up by the first gusts, Gervaise began to walk faster. Eager to\r\nget home, men were running along, with their shoulders already white.\r\nAnd as she suddenly saw one who, on the contrary, was coming slowly\r\ntowards her under the trees, she approached him and again said: \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\r\njust listen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man has stopped. But he did not seem to have heard her. He held out\r\nhis hand, and muttered in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cCharity, if you please!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at one another. Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ They were reduced to\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94Pere Bru begging, Madame Coupeau walking the streets! They\r\nremained stupefied in front of each other. They could join hands as\r\nequals now. The old workman had prowled about the whole evening, not\r\ndaring to stop anyone, and the first person he accosted was as hungry\r\nas himself. Lord, was it not pitiful! To have toiled for fifty years\r\nand be obliged to beg! To have been one of the most prosperous\r\nlaundresses in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or and to end beside the gutter!\r\nThey still looked at one another. Then, without saying a word, they\r\nwent off in different directions under the lashing snow.\r\n\r\nIt was a perfect tempest. On these heights, in the midst of this open\r\nspace, the fine snow revolved round and round as if the wind came from\r\nthe four corners of heaven. You could not see ten paces off, everything\r\nwas confused in the midst of this flying dust. The surroundings had\r\ndisappeared, the Boulevard seemed to be dead, as if the storm had\r\nstretched the silence of its white sheet over the hiccoughs of the last\r\ndrunkards. Gervaise still went on, blinded, lost. She felt her way by\r\ntouching the trees. As she advanced the gas-lamps shone out amidst the\r\nwhiteness like torches. Then, suddenly, whenever she crossed an open\r\nspace, these lights failed her; she was enveloped in the whirling snow,\r\nunable to distinguish anything to guide her. Below stretched the\r\nground, vaguely white; grey walls surrounded her, and when she paused,\r\nhesitating and turning her head, she divined that behind this icy veil\r\nextended the immense avenue with interminable vistas of gas-lamps\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nblack and deserted Infinite of Paris asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was standing where the outer Boulevard meets the Boulevards Magenta\r\nand Ornano, thinking of lying down on the ground, when suddenly she\r\nheard a footfall. She began to run, but the snow blinded her, and the\r\nfootsteps went off without her being able to tell whether it was to the\r\nright or to the left. At last, however, she perceived a man\xe2\x80\x99s broad\r\nshoulders, a dark form which was disappearing amid the snow. Oh! she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let this man get away. And she ran on all the faster, reached\r\nhim, and caught him by the blouse: \xe2\x80\x9cSir, sir, just listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man turned round. It was Goujet.\r\n\r\nSo now she had accosted Golden-Beard. But what had she done on earth to\r\nbe tortured like this by Providence? It was the crowning blow\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nstumble against Goujet, and be seen by her blacksmith friend, pale and\r\nbegging, like a common street walker. And it happened just under a\r\ngas-lamp; she could see her deformed shadow swaying on the snow like a\r\nreal caricature. You would have said she was drunk. _Mon Dieu!_ not to\r\nhave a crust of bread, or a drop of wine in her body, and to be taken\r\nfor a drunken women! It was her own fault, why did she booze? Goujet no\r\ndoubt thought she had been drinking, and that she was up to some nasty\r\npranks.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her while the snow scattered daisies over his beautiful\r\nyellow beard. Then as she lowered her head and stepped back he detained\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nAnd he walked on first. She followed him. They both crossed the silent\r\ndistrict, gliding noiselessly along the walls. Poor Madame Goujet had\r\ndied of rheumatism in the month of October. Goujet still resided in the\r\nlittle house in the Rue Neuve, living gloomily alone. On this occasion\r\nhe was belated because he had sat up nursing a wounded comrade. When he\r\nhad opened the door and lighted a lamp, he turned towards Gervaise, who\r\nhad remained humbly on the threshold. Then, in a low voice, as if he\r\nwere afraid his mother could still hear him, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cCome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first room, Madame Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s, was piously preserved in the state she\r\nhad left it. On a chair near the window lay the tambour by the side of\r\nthe large arm-chair, which seemed to be waiting for the old\r\nlace-worker. The bed was made, and she could have stretched herself\r\nbeneath the sheets if she had left the cemetery to come and spend the\r\nevening with her child. There was something solemn, a perfume of\r\nhonesty and goodness about the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the blacksmith in a louder tone.\r\n\r\nShe went in, half frightened, like a disreputable woman gliding into a\r\nrespectable place. He was quite pale, and trembled at the thought of\r\nushering a woman like this into his dead mother\xe2\x80\x99s home. They crossed\r\nthe room on tip-toe, as if they were ashamed to be heard. Then when he\r\nhad pushed Gervaise into his own room he closed the door. Here he was\r\nat home. It was the narrow closet she was acquainted with; a\r\nschoolgirl\xe2\x80\x99s room, with the little iron bedstead hung with white\r\ncurtains. On the walls the engravings cut out of illustrated newspapers\r\nhad gathered and spread, and they now reached to the ceiling. The room\r\nlooked so pure that Gervaise did not dare to advance, but retreated as\r\nfar as she could from the lamp. Then without a word, in a transport as\r\nit were, he tried to seize hold of her and press her in his arms. But\r\nshe felt faint and murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! _Mon Dieu!_ Oh, _mon Dieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fire in the stove, having been covered with coke-dust, was still\r\nalight, and the remains of a stew which Goujet had put to warm,\r\nthinking he should return to dinner, was smoking in front of the\r\ncinders. Gervaise, who felt her numbness leave her in the warmth of\r\nthis room, would have gone down on all fours to eat out of the\r\nsaucepan. Her hunger was stronger than her will; her stomach seemed\r\nrent in two; and she stooped down with a sigh. Goujet had realized the\r\ntruth. He placed the stew on the table, cut some bread, and poured her\r\nout a glass of wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you! Thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how kind you are! Thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stammered; she could hardly articulate. When she caught hold of her\r\nfork she began to tremble so acutely that she let it fall again. The\r\nhunger that possessed her made her wag her head as if senile. She\r\ncarried the food to her mouth with her fingers. As she stuffed the\r\nfirst potato into her mouth, she burst out sobbing. Big tears coursed\r\ndown her cheeks and fell onto her bread. She still ate, gluttonously\r\ndevouring this bread thus moistened by her tears, and breathing very\r\nhard all the while. Goujet compelled her to drink to prevent her from\r\nstifling, and her glass chinked, as it were, against her teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have some more bread?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in an undertone.\r\n\r\nShe cried, she said \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d she said \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. Ah! how nice\r\nand yet how painful it is to eat when one is starving.\r\n\r\nAnd standing in front of her, Goujet looked at her all the while; under\r\nthe bright light cast by the lamp-shade he could see her well. How aged\r\nand altered she seemed! The heat was melting the snow on her hair and\r\nclothes, and she was dripping. Her poor wagging head was quite grey;\r\nthere were any number of grey locks which the wind had disarranged. Her\r\nneck sank into her shoulders and she had become so fat and ugly you\r\nmight have cried on noticing the change. He recollected their love,\r\nwhen she was quite rosy, working with her irons, and showing the\r\nchild-like crease which set such a charming necklace round her throat.\r\nIn those times he had watched her for hours, glad just to look at her.\r\nLater on she had come to the forge, and there they had enjoyed\r\nthemselves whilst he beat the iron, and she stood by watching his\r\nhammer dance. How often at night, with his head buried in his pillow,\r\nhad he dreamed of holding her in his arms.\r\n\r\nGervaise rose; she had finished. She remained for a moment with her\r\nhead lowered, and ill at ease. Then, thinking she detected a gleam in\r\nhis eyes, she raised her hand to her jacket and began to unfasten the\r\nfirst button. But Goujet had fallen on his knees, and taking hold of\r\nher hands, he exclaimed softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Madame Gervaise; oh! I love you still, and in spite of\r\neverything, I swear it to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, Monsieur Goujet!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, maddened to see him like\r\nthis at her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that; you grieve me too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he repeated that he could never love twice in his life, she\r\nbecame yet more despairing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I am too ashamed. For the love of God get up. It is my place\r\nto be on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, he trembled all over and stammered: \xe2\x80\x9cWill you allow me to kiss\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOvercome with surprise and emotion she could not speak, but she\r\nassented with a nod of the head. After all she was his; he could do\r\nwhat he chose with her. But he merely kissed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat suffices between us, Madame Gervaise,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sums up\r\nall our friendship, does it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had kissed her on the forehead, on a lock of her grey hair. He had\r\nnot kissed anyone since his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death. His sweetheart Gervaise\r\nalone remained to him in life. And then, when he had kissed her with so\r\nmuch respect, he fell back across his bed with sobs rising in his\r\nthroat. And Gervaise could not remain there any longer. It was too sad\r\nand too abominable to meet again under such circumstances when one\r\nloved. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, Monsieur Goujet,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you\r\ndearly, also. Oh! it isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible you still love me. Good-bye,\r\ngood-bye; it would smother us both; it would be more than we could\r\nstand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she darted through Madame Goujet\xe2\x80\x99s room and found herself outside\r\non the pavement again. When she recovered her senses she had rung at\r\nthe door in the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or and Boche was pulling the string.\r\nThe house was quite dark, and in the black night the yawning,\r\ndilapidated porch looked like an open mouth. To think that she had been\r\nambitious of having a corner in this barracks! Had her ears been\r\nstopped up then, that she had not heard the cursed music of despair\r\nwhich sounded behind the walls? Since she had set foot in the place she\r\nhad begun to go down hill. Yes, it must bring bad luck to shut oneself\r\nup in these big workmen\xe2\x80\x99s houses; the cholera of misery was contagious\r\nthere. That night everyone seemed to have kicked the bucket. She only\r\nheard the Boches snoring on the right-hand side, while Lantier and\r\nVirginie on the left were purring like a couple of cats who were not\r\nasleep, but have their eyes closed and feel warm. In the courtyard she\r\nfancied she was in a perfect cemetery; the snow paved the ground with\r\nwhite; the high frontages, livid grey in tint, rose up unlighted like\r\nruined walls, and not a sigh could be heard. It seemed as if a whole\r\nvillage, stiffened with cold and hunger, were buried here. She had to\r\nstep over a black gutter\xe2\x80\x94water from the dye-works\xe2\x80\x94which smoked and\r\nstreaked the whiteness of the snow with its muddy course. It was the\r\ncolor of her thoughts. The beautiful light blue and light pink waters\r\nhad long since flowed away.\r\n\r\nThen, whilst ascending the six flights of stairs in the dark, she could\r\nnot prevent herself from laughing; an ugly laugh which hurt her. She\r\nrecalled her ideal of former days: to work quietly, always have bread\r\nto eat and a tidy house to sleep in, to bring up her children, not to\r\nbe beaten and to die in her bed. No, really, it was comical how all\r\nthat was becoming realized! She no longer worked, she no longer ate,\r\nshe slept on filth, her husband frequented all sorts of wineshops, and\r\nher husband drubbed her at all hours of the day; all that was left for\r\nher to do was to die on the pavement, and it would not take long if on\r\ngetting into her room, she could only pluck up courage to fling herself\r\nout of the window. Was it not enough to make one think that she had\r\nhoped to earn thirty thousand francs a year, and no end of respect? Ah!\r\nreally, in this life it is no use being modest; one only gets sat upon.\r\nNot even pap and a nest, that is the common lot.\r\n\r\nWhat increased her ugly laugh was the recollection of her grand hope of\r\nretiring into the country after twenty years passed in ironing. Well!\r\nshe was on her way to the country. She was going to have her green\r\ncorner in the Pere-Lachaise cemetery.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered the passage she was like a mad-woman. Her poor head\r\nwas whirling round. At heart her great grief was at having bid the\r\nblacksmith an eternal farewell. All was ended between them; they would\r\nnever see each other more. Then, besides that, all her other thoughts\r\nof misfortune pressed upon her, and almost caused her head to split. As\r\nshe passed she poked her nose in at the Bijards\xe2\x80\x99 and beheld Lalie dead,\r\nwith a look of contentment on her face at having at last been laid out\r\nand slumbering forever. Ah, well! children were luckier than grown-up\r\npeople. And, as a glimmer of light passed under old Bazouge\xe2\x80\x99s door, she\r\nwalked boldly in, seized with a mania for going off on the same journey\r\nas the little one.\r\n\r\nThat old joker, Bazouge, had come home that night in an extraordinary\r\nstate of gaiety. He had had such a booze that he was snoring on the\r\nground in spite of the temperature, and that no doubt did not prevent\r\nhim from dreaming something pleasant, for he seemed to be laughing from\r\nhis stomach as he slept. The candle, which he had not put out, lighted\r\nup his old garments, his black cloak, which he had drawn over his knees\r\nas though it had been a blanket.\r\n\r\nOn beholding him Gervaise uttered such a deep wailing that he awoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ shut the door! It\xe2\x80\x99s so cold! Ah! it\xe2\x80\x99s you! What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter? What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, Gervaise, stretching out her arms, no longer knowing what she\r\nstuttered, began passionately to implore him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! take me away! I\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough; I want to go off. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nme any grudge. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. One never knows until one\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Oh,\r\nyes; one\xe2\x80\x99s glad to go one day! Take me away! Take me away and I shall\r\nthank you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fell on her knees, all shaken with a desire which caused her to\r\nturn ghastly pale. Never before had she thus dragged herself at a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet. Old Bazouge\xe2\x80\x99s ugly mug, with his mouth all on one side and his\r\nhide begrimed with the dust of funerals, seemed to her as beautiful and\r\nresplendent as a sun. The old fellow, who was scarcely awake thought,\r\nhowever, that it was some sort of bad joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured he, \xe2\x80\x9cno jokes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me away,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gervaise more ardently still. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember, I\r\nknocked one evening against the partition; then I said that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrue, because I was still a fool. But see! Give me your hands. I\xe2\x80\x99m no\r\nlonger frightened. Take me away to by-by; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see how still I\xe2\x80\x99ll be.\r\nOh! sleep, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I care for. Oh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll love you so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBazouge, ever gallant, thought that he ought not to be hasty with a\r\nlady who appeared to have taken such a fancy to him. She was falling to\r\npieces, but all the same, what remained was very fine, especially when\r\nshe was excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is very true,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a convinced manner. \xe2\x80\x9cI packed\r\nup three more to-day who would only have been too glad to have given me\r\nsomething for myself, could they but have got their hands to their\r\npockets. But, little woman, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so easily settled as all that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me away, take me away,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Gervaise, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but there\xe2\x80\x99s a little operation to be gone through beforehand\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nknow, glug!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made a noise in his throat, as though swallowing his tongue.\r\nThen, thinking it a good joke, he chuckled.\r\n\r\nGervaise slowly rose to her feet. So he too could do nothing for her.\r\nShe went to her room and threw herself on her straw, feeling stupid,\r\nand regretting she had eaten. Ah! no indeed, misery did not kill\r\nquickly enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Coupeau went on a spree. Next day, Gervaise received ten\r\nfrancs from her son Etienne, who was a mechanic on some railway. The\r\nyoungster sent her a few francs from time to time, knowing that they\r\nwere not very well off at home. She made some soup, and ate it all\r\nalone, for that scoundrel Coupeau did not return on the morrow. On\r\nMonday he was still absent, and on Tuesday also. The whole week went\r\nby. Ah, it would be good luck if some woman took him in.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday Gervaise received a printed document. It was to inform her\r\nthat her husband was dying at the Sainte-Anne asylum.\r\n\r\nGervaise did not disturb herself. He knew the way; he could very well\r\nget home from the asylum by himself. They had cured him there so often\r\nthat they could once more do him the sorry service of putting him on\r\nhis pins again. Had she not heard that very morning that for the week\r\nbefore Coupeau had been seen as round as a ball, rolling about\r\nBelleville from one dram shop to another in the company of My-Boots.\r\nExactly so; and it was My-Boots, too, who stood treat. He must have\r\nhooked his missus\xe2\x80\x99s stocking with all the savings gained at very hard\r\nwork. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clean money they had used, but money that could infect\r\nthem with any manner of vile diseases. Well, anyway, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthought to invite her for a drink. If you wanted to drink by yourself,\r\nyou could croak by yourself.\r\n\r\nHowever, on Monday, as Gervaise had a nice little meal planned for the\r\nevening, the remains of some beans and a pint of wine, she pretended to\r\nherself that a walk would give her an appetite. The letter from the\r\nasylum which she had left lying on the bureau bothered her. The snow\r\nhad melted, the day was mild and grey and on the whole fine, with just\r\na slight keenness in the air which was invigorating. She started at\r\nnoon, for her walk was a long one. She had to cross Paris and her bad\r\nleg always slowed her. With that the streets were crowded; but the\r\npeople amused her; she reached her destination very pleasantly. When\r\nshe had given her name, she was told a most astounding story to the\r\neffect that Coupeau had been fished out of the Seine close to the\r\nPont-Neuf. He had jumped over the parapet, under the impression that a\r\nbearded man was barring his way. A fine jump, was it not? And as for\r\nfinding out how Coupeau got to be on the Pont-Neuf, that was a matter\r\nhe could not even explain himself.\r\n\r\nOne of the keepers escorted Gervaise. She was ascending a staircase,\r\nwhen she heard howlings which made her shiver to her very bones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s playing a nice music, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the keeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, your old man! He\xe2\x80\x99s been yelling like that ever since the day\r\nbefore yesterday; and he dances, you\xe2\x80\x99ll just see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Mon Dieu!_ what a sight! She stood as one transfixed. The cell was\r\npadded from the floor to the ceiling. On the floor there were two straw\r\nmats, one piled on top of the other; and in a corner were spread a\r\nmattress and a bolster, nothing more. Inside there Coupeau was dancing\r\nand yelling, his blouse in tatters and his limbs beating the air. He\r\nwore the mask of one about to die. What a breakdown! He bumped up\r\nagainst the window, then retired backwards, beating time with his arms\r\nand shaking his hands as though he were trying to wrench them off and\r\nfling them in somebody\xe2\x80\x99s face. One meets with buffoons in low dancing\r\nplaces who imitate the delirium tremens, only they imitate it badly.\r\nOne must see this drunkard\xe2\x80\x99s dance if one wishes to know what it is\r\nlike when gone through in earnest. The song also has its merits, a\r\ncontinuous yell worthy of carnival-time, a mouth wide open uttering the\r\nsame hoarse trombone notes for hours together. Coupeau had the howl of\r\na beast with a crushed paw. Strike up, music! Gentlemen, choose your\r\npartners!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Mon Dieu!_ what is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrepeated Gervaise, seized with fear.\r\n\r\nA house surgeon, a big fair fellow with a rosy countenance, and wearing\r\na white apron, was quietly sitting taking notes. The case was a curious\r\none; the doctor did not leave the patient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a while if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the laundress; \xe2\x80\x9cbut keep quiet.\r\nTry and speak to him, he will not recognise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau indeed did not even appear to see his wife. She had only had a\r\nbad view of him on entering, he was wriggling about so much. When she\r\nlooked him full in the face, she stood aghast. _Mon Dieu!_ was it\r\npossible he had a countenance like that, his eyes full of blood and his\r\nlips covered with scabs? She would certainly never have known him. To\r\nbegin with, he was making too many grimaces, without saying why, his\r\nmouth suddenly out of all shape, his nose curled up, his cheeks drawn\r\nin, a perfect animal\xe2\x80\x99s muzzle. His skin was so hot the air steamed\r\naround him; and his hide was as though varnished, covered with a heavy\r\nsweat which trickled off him. In his mad dance, one could see all the\r\nsame that he was not at his ease, his head was heavy and his limbs\r\nached.\r\n\r\nGervaise drew near to the house surgeon, who was strumming a tune with\r\nthe tips of his fingers on the back of his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, sir, it\xe2\x80\x99s serious then this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe house surgeon nodded his head without answering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he jabbering to himself? Eh! don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear? What\xe2\x80\x99s it about?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout things he sees,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet, let me\r\nlisten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoupeau was speaking in a jerky voice. A glimmer of amusement lit up\r\nhis eyes. He looked on the floor, to the right, to the left, and turned\r\nabout as though he had been strolling in the Bois de Vincennes,\r\nconversing with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s nice, that\xe2\x80\x99s grand! There\xe2\x80\x99re cottages, a regular fair. And\r\nsome jolly fine music! What a Balthazar\xe2\x80\x99s feast! They\xe2\x80\x99re smashing the\r\ncrockery in there. Awfully swell! Now it\xe2\x80\x99s being lit up; red balls in\r\nthe air, and it jumps, and it flies! Oh! oh! what a lot of lanterns in\r\nthe trees! It\xe2\x80\x99s confoundedly pleasant! There\xe2\x80\x99s water flowing\r\neverywhere, fountains, cascades, water which sings, oh! with the voice\r\nof a chorister. The cascades are grand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he drew himself up, as though the better to hear the delicious song\r\nof the water; he sucked in forcibly, fancying he was drinking the fresh\r\nspray blown from the fountains. But, little by little, his face resumed\r\nan agonized expression. Then he crouched down and flew quicker than\r\never around the walls of the cell, uttering vague threats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore traps, all that! I thought as much. Silence, you set of\r\nswindlers! Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re making a fool of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s for that that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndrinking and bawling inside there with your viragoes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll demolish\r\nyou, you and your cottage! Damnation! Will you leave me in peace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clinched his fists; then he uttered a hoarse cry, stooping as he\r\nran. And he stuttered, his teeth chattering with fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so that I may kill myself. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t throw myself in! All that\r\nwater means that I\xe2\x80\x99ve no heart. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t throw myself in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cascades, which fled at his approach, advanced when he retired. And\r\nall of a sudden, he looked stupidly around him, mumbling, in a voice\r\nwhich was scarcely audible:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, they set conjurers against me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go. Good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise to the house\r\nsurgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt upsets me too much; I\xe2\x80\x99ll come again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was quite white. Coupeau was continuing his breakdown from the\r\nwindow to the mattress and from the mattress to the window, perspiring,\r\ntoiling, always beating the same rhythm. Then she hurried away. But\r\nthough she scrambled down the stairs, she still heard her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfounded jig until she reached the bottom. Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ how\r\npleasant it was out of doors, one could breathe there!\r\n\r\nThat evening everyone in the tenement was discussing Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s strange\r\nmalady. The Boches invited Gervaise to have a drink with them, even\r\nthough they now considered Clump-clump beneath them, in order to hear\r\nall the details. Madame Lorilleux and Madame Poisson were there also.\r\nBoche told of a carpenter he had known who had been a drinker of\r\nabsinthe. The man shed his clothes, went out in the street and danced\r\nthe polka until he died. That rather struck the ladies as comic, even\r\nthough it was very sad.\r\n\r\nGervaise got up in the middle of the room and did an imitation of\r\nCoupeau. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s just how it was. Can anyone feature a man doing\r\nthat for hours on end? If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe they could go see for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn getting up the next morning, Gervaise promised herself she would not\r\nreturn to the Sainte-Anne again. What use would it be? She did not want\r\nto go off her head also. However, every ten minutes, she fell to musing\r\nand became absent-minded. It would be curious though, if he were still\r\nthrowing his legs about. When twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck, she could no\r\nlonger resist; she started off and did not notice how long the walk\r\nwas, her brain was so full of her desire to go and the dread of what\r\nawaited her.\r\n\r\nOh! there was no need for her to ask for news. She heard Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s song\r\nthe moment she reached the foot of the staircase. Just the same tune,\r\njust the same dance. She might have thought herself going up again\r\nafter having only been down for a minute. The attendant of the day\r\nbefore, who was carrying some jugs of tisane along the corridor, winked\r\nhis eye as he met her, by way of being amiable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill the same, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! still the same!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied without stopping.\r\n\r\nShe entered the room, but she remained near the door, because there\r\nwere some people with Coupeau. The fair, rosy house surgeon was\r\nstanding up, having given his chair to a bald old gentleman who was\r\ndecorated and had a pointed face like a weasel. He was no doubt the\r\nhead doctor, for his glance was as sharp and piercing as a gimlet. All\r\nthe dealers in sudden death have a glance like that.\r\n\r\nNo, really, it was not a pretty sight; and Gervaise, all in a tremble,\r\nasked herself why she had returned. To think that the evening before\r\nthey accused her at the Boches\xe2\x80\x99 of exaggerating the picture! Now she\r\nsaw better how Coupeau set about it, his eyes wide open looking into\r\nspace, and she would never forget it. She overheard a few words between\r\nthe house surgeon and the head doctor. The former was giving some\r\ndetails of the night: her husband had talked and thrown himself about,\r\nthat was what it amounted to. Then the bald-headed old gentleman, who\r\nwas not very polite by the way, at length appeared to become aware of\r\nher presence; and when the house surgeon had informed him that she was\r\nthe patient\xe2\x80\x99s wife, he began to question her in the harsh manner of a\r\ncommissary of the police.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid this man\xe2\x80\x99s father drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; just a little like everyone. He killed himself by falling\r\nfrom a roof one day when he was tipsy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid his mother drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! sir, like everyone else, you know; a drop here, a drop there.\r\nOh! the family is very respectable! There was a brother who died very\r\nyoung in convulsions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at her with his piercing eye. He resumed in his rough\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, you drink too, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGervaise stammered, protested, and placed her hand upon her heart, as\r\nthough to take her solemn oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou drink! Take care; see where drink leads to. One day or other you\r\nwill die thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she remained close to the wall. The doctor had turned his back to\r\nher. He squatted down, without troubling himself as to whether his\r\novercoat trailed in the dust of the matting; for a long while he\r\nstudied Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s trembling, waiting for its reappearance, following it\r\nwith his glance. That day the legs were going in their turn, the\r\ntrembling had descended from the hands to the feet; a regular puppet\r\nwith his strings being pulled, throwing his limbs about, whilst the\r\ntrunk of his body remained as stiff as a piece of wood. The disease\r\nprogressed little by little. It was like a musical box beneath the\r\nskin; it started off every three or four seconds and rolled along for\r\nan instant; then it stopped and then it started off again, just the\r\nsame as the little shiver which shakes stray dogs in winter, when cold\r\nand standing in some doorway for protection. Already the middle of the\r\nbody and the shoulders quivered like water on the point of boiling. It\r\nwas a funny demolition all the same, going off wriggling like a girl\r\nbeing tickled.\r\n\r\nCoupeau, meanwhile, was complaining in a hollow voice. He seemed to\r\nsuffer a great deal more than the day before. His broken murmurs\r\ndisclosed all sorts of ailments. Thousands of pins were pricking him.\r\nHe felt something heavy all about his body; some cold, wet animal was\r\ncrawling over his thighs and digging its fangs into his flesh. Then\r\nthere were other animals sticking to his shoulders, tearing his back\r\nwith their claws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thirsty, oh! I\xe2\x80\x99m thirsty!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned he continually.\r\n\r\nThe house surgeon handed him a little lemonade from a small shelf;\r\nCoupeau seized the mug in both hands and greedily took a mouthful,\r\nspilling half the liquid over himself; but he spat it out at once with\r\nfurious disgust, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamnation! It\xe2\x80\x99s brandy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, on a sign from the doctor, the house surgeon tried to make him\r\ndrink some water without leaving go of the bottle. This time he\r\nswallowed the mouthful, yelling as though he had swallowed fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s brandy; damnation! It\xe2\x80\x99s brandy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSince the night before, everything he had had to drink was brandy. It\r\nredoubled his thirst and he could no longer drink, because everything\r\nburnt him. They had brought him some broth, but they were evidently\r\ntrying to poison him, for the broth smelt of vitriol. The bread was\r\nsour and moldy. There was nothing but poison around him. The cell stank\r\nof sulphur. He even accused persons of rubbing matches under his nose\r\nto infect him.\r\n\r\nAll on a sudden he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the rats, there\xe2\x80\x99re the rats now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were black balls that were changing into rats. These filthy\r\nanimals got fatter and fatter, then they jumped onto the mattress and\r\ndisappeared. There was also a monkey which came out of the wall, and\r\nwent back into the wall, and which approached so near him each time,\r\nthat he drew back through fear of having his nose bitten off. Suddenly\r\nthere was another change, the walls were probably cutting capers, for\r\nhe yelled out, choking with terror and rage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, gee up! Shake me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! Gee up! Tumble down! Yes,\r\nring the bells, you black crows! Play the organ to prevent my calling\r\nthe police. They\xe2\x80\x99ve put a bomb behind the wall, the lousy scoundrels! I\r\ncan hear it, it snorts, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to blow us up! Fire! Damnation,\r\nfire! There\xe2\x80\x99s a cry of fire! There it blazes. Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting lighter,\r\nlighter! All the sky\xe2\x80\x99s burning, red fires, green fires, yellow fires.\r\nHi! Help! Fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis cries became lost in a rattle. He now only mumbled disconnected\r\nwords, foaming at the mouth, his chin wet with saliva. The doctor\r\nrubbed his nose with his finger, a movement no doubt habitual with him\r\nin the presence of serious cases. He turned to the house surgeon, and\r\nasked him in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the temperature, still the hundred degrees, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor pursed his lips. He continued there another two minutes, his\r\neyes fixed on Coupeau. Then he shrugged his shoulders, adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same treatment, broth, milk, lemonade, and the potion of extract\r\nof quinine. Do not leave him, and call me if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out and Gervaise followed him, to ask him if there was any\r\nhope. But he walked so stiffly along the corridor, that she did not\r\ndare approach him. She stood rooted there a minute, hesitating whether\r\nto return and look at her husband. The time she had already passed had\r\nbeen far from pleasant. As she again heard him calling out that the\r\nlemonade smelt of brandy, she hurried away, having had enough of the\r\nperformance. In the streets, the galloping of the horses and the noise\r\nof the vehicles made her fancy that all the inmates of Saint-Anne were\r\nat her heels. And that the doctor had threatened her! Really, she\r\nalready thought she had the complaint.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or the Boches and the others were naturally\r\nawaiting her. The moment she appeared they called her into the\r\nconcierge\xe2\x80\x99s room. Well! was old Coupeau still in the land of the\r\nliving? _Mon Dieu!_ yes, he still lived. Boche seemed amazed and\r\nconfounded; he had bet a bottle that old Coupeau would not last till\r\nthe evening. What! He still lived! And they all exhibited their\r\nastonishment, and slapped their thighs. There was a fellow who lasted!\r\nMadame Lorilleux reckoned up the hours; thirty-six hours and\r\ntwenty-four hours, sixty hours. _Sacre Dieu!_ already sixty hours that\r\nhe had been doing the jig and screaming! Such a feat of strength had\r\nnever been seen before. But Boche, who was upset that he had lost the\r\nbet, questioned Gervaise with an air of doubt, asking her if she was\r\nquite sure he had not filed off behind her back. Oh! no, he had no\r\ndesire to, he jumped about too much. Then Boche, still doubting, begged\r\nher to show them again a little how he was acting, just so they could\r\nsee. Yes, yes, a little more! The request was general! The company told\r\nher she would be very kind if she would oblige, for just then two\r\nneighbors happened to be there who had not been present the day before,\r\nand who had come down purposely to see the performance. The concierge\r\ncalled to everybody to make room, they cleared the centre of the\r\napartment, pushing one another with their elbows, and quivering with\r\ncuriosity. Gervaise, however, hung down her head. Really, she was\r\nafraid it might upset her. Desirous though of showing that she did not\r\nrefuse for the sake of being pressed, she tried two or three little\r\nleaps; but she became quite queer, and stopped; on her word of honor,\r\nshe was not equal to it! There was a murmur of disappointment; it was a\r\npity, she imitated it perfectly. However, she could not do it, it was\r\nno use insisting! And when Virginie left to return to her shop, they\r\nforgot all about old Coupeau and began to gossip about the Poissons and\r\ntheir home, a real mess now. The day before, the bailiffs had been; the\r\npoliceman was about to lose his place; as for Lantier, he was now\r\nmaking up to the daughter of the restaurant keeper next door, a fine\r\nwoman, who talked of setting up as a tripe-seller. Ah! it was amusing,\r\neveryone already beheld a tripe-seller occupying the shop; after the\r\nsweets should come something substantial. And that blind Poisson! How\r\ncould a man whose profession required him to be so smart fail to see\r\nwhat was going on in his own home? They stopped talking suddenly when\r\nthey noticed that Gervaise was off in a corner by herself imitating\r\nCoupeau. Her hands and feet were jerking. Yes, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for a\r\nbetter performance! Then Gervaise started as if waking from a dream and\r\nhurried away calling out good-night to everyone.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, the Boches saw her start off at twelve, the same as on\r\nthe two previous days. They wished her a pleasant afternoon. That day\r\nthe corridor at Sainte-Anne positively shook with Coupeau\xe2\x80\x99s yells and\r\nkicks. She had not left the stairs when she heard him yelling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of bugs!\xe2\x80\x94Come this way again that I may squash you!\xe2\x80\x94Ah!\r\nthey want to kill me! ah! the bugs!\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a bigger swell than the lot of\r\nyou! Clear out, damnation! Clear out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment she stood panting before the door. Was he then fighting\r\nagainst an army? When she entered, the performance had increased and\r\nwas embellished even more than on previous occasions. Coupeau was a\r\nraving madman, the same as one sees at the Charenton mad-house! He was\r\nthrowing himself about in the center of the cell, slamming his fists\r\neverywhere, on himself, on the walls, on the floor, and stumbling about\r\npunching empty space. He wanted to open the window, and he hid himself,\r\ndefended himself, called, answered, produced all this uproar without\r\nthe least assistance, in the exasperated way of a man beset by a mob of\r\npeople. Then Gervaise understood that he fancied he was on a roof,\r\nlaying down sheets of zinc. He imitated the bellows with his mouth, he\r\nmoved the iron about in the fire and knelt down so as to pass his thumb\r\nalong the edges of the mat, thinking that he was soldering it. Yes, his\r\nhandicraft returned to him at the moment of croaking; and if he yelled\r\nso loud, if he fought on his roof, it was because ugly scoundrels were\r\npreventing him doing his work properly. On all the neighboring roofs\r\nwere villains mocking and tormenting him. Besides that, the jokers were\r\nletting troops of rats loose about his legs. Ah! the filthy beasts, he\r\nsaw them always! Though he kept crushing them, bringing his foot down\r\nwith all his strength, fresh hordes of them continued passing, until\r\nthey quite covered the roof. And there were spiders there too! He\r\nroughly pressed his trousers against his thigh to squash some big\r\nspiders which had crept up his leg. _Mon Dieu!_ he would never finish\r\nhis day\xe2\x80\x99s work, they wanted to destroy him, his employer would send him\r\nto prison. Then, whilst making haste, he suddenly imagined he had a\r\nsteam-engine in his stomach; with his mouth wide open, he puffed out\r\nthe smoke, a dense smoke which filled the cell and found an outlet by\r\nthe window; and, bending forward, still puffing, he looked outside of\r\nthe cloud of smoke as it unrolled and ascended to the sky, where it hid\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the band of the Chaussee Clignancourt,\r\ndisguised as bears with drums, putting on a show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained crouching before the window, as though he had been watching\r\na procession in a street, from some rooftop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the cavalcade, lions and panthers making grimaces\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrats dressed up as dogs and cats\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s tall Clemence, with her wig\r\nfull of feathers. Ah! _Mon Dieu!_ she\xe2\x80\x99s turning head over heels; she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshowed everything\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d better run, Duckie. Hey, the cops, leave her\r\nalone!\xe2\x80\x94just you leave her alone\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot! Don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice rose, hoarse and terrified and he stooped down quickly,\r\nsaying that the police and the military were below, men who were aiming\r\nat him with rifles. In the wall he saw the barrel of a pistol emerging,\r\npointed at his breast. They had dragged the girl away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t shoot! _Mon Dieu!_ Don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, the buildings were tumbling down, he imitated the cracking of a\r\nwhole neighborhood collapsing; and all disappeared, all flew off. But\r\nhe had no time to take breath, other pictures passed with extraordinary\r\nrapidity. A furious desire to speak filled his mouth full of words\r\nwhich he uttered without any connection, and with a gurgling sound in\r\nhis throat. He continued to raise his voice, louder and louder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallow, it\xe2\x80\x99s you? Good-day! No jokes! Don\xe2\x80\x99t make me nuzzle your hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he passed his hand before his face, he blew to send the hairs away.\r\nThe house surgeon questioned him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was looking at the wall, with his back to Gervaise. The latter had a\r\nrare fright, and she examined the wall, to see if she also could catch\r\nsight of herself there. He continued talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you know, none of your wheedling\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t be tied down! You are\r\npretty, you have got a fine dress. Where did you get the money for it,\r\nyou cow? You\xe2\x80\x99ve been at a party, camel! Wait a bit and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do for you!\r\nAh! you\xe2\x80\x99re hiding your boy friend behind your skirts. Who is it? Stoop\r\ndown that I may see. Damnation, it\xe2\x80\x99s him again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a terrible leap, he went head first against the wall; but the\r\npadding softened the blow. One only heard his body rebounding onto the\r\nmatting, where the shock had sent him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it you see?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the house surgeon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hatter! The hatter!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Coupeau.\r\n\r\nAnd the house surgeon questioning Gervaise, the latter stuttered\r\nwithout being able to answer, for this scene stirred up within her all\r\nthe worries of her life. The zinc-worker thrust out his fists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll settle this between us, my lad. It\xe2\x80\x99s full time I did for you!\r\nAh, you coolly come, with that virago on your arm, to make a fool of me\r\nbefore everyone. Well! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to throttle you\xe2\x80\x94yes, yes, I! And\r\nwithout putting any gloves on either! I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop your swaggering. Take\r\nthat! And that! And that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hit about in the air viciously. Then a wild rage took possession of\r\nhim. Having bumped against the wall in walking backwards, he thought he\r\nwas being attacked from behind. He turned round, and fiercely hammered\r\naway at the padding. He sprang about, jumped from one corner to\r\nanother, knocked his stomach, his back, his shoulder, rolled over, and\r\npicked himself up again. His bones seemed softened, his flesh had a\r\nsound like damp oakum. He accompanied this pretty game with atrocious\r\nthreats, and wild and guttural cries. However the battle must have been\r\ngoing badly for him, for his breathing became quicker, his eyes were\r\nstarting out of his head, and he seemed little by little to be seized\r\nwith the cowardice of a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurder! Murder! Be off with you both. Oh! you brutes, they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlaughing. There she is on her back, the virago! She must give in, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsettled. Ah! the brigand, he\xe2\x80\x99s murdering her! He\xe2\x80\x99s cutting off her leg\r\nwith his knife. The other leg\xe2\x80\x99s on the ground, the stomach\xe2\x80\x99s in two,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s full of blood. Oh! _Mon Dieu!_ Oh! _Mon Dieu!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, covered with perspiration, his hair standing on end, looking a\r\nfrightful object, he retired backwards, violently waving his arms, as\r\nthough to send the abominable sight from him. He uttered two\r\nheart-rending wails, and fell flat on his back on the mattress, against\r\nwhich his heels had caught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead, sir, he\xe2\x80\x99s dead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gervaise, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\nThe house surgeon had drawn near, and was pulling Coupeau into the\r\nmiddle of the mattress. No, he was not dead. They had taken his shoes\r\noff. His bare feet hung off the end of the mattress and they were\r\ndancing all by themselves, one beside the other, in time, a little\r\nhurried and regular dance.\r\n\r\nJust then the head doctor entered. He had brought two of his\r\ncolleagues\xe2\x80\x94one thin, the other fat, and both decorated like himself.\r\nAll three stooped down without saying a word, and examined the man all\r\nover; then they rapidly conversed together in a low voice. They had\r\nuncovered Coupeau from his thighs to his shoulders, and by standing on\r\ntiptoe Gervaise could see the naked trunk spread out. Well! it was\r\ncomplete. The trembling had descended from the arms and ascended from\r\nthe legs, and now the trunk itself was getting lively!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the head doctor.\r\n\r\nAnd he called the two others\xe2\x80\x99 attention to the man\xe2\x80\x99s countenance.\r\nCoupeau, his eyes closed, had little nervous twinges which drew up all\r\nhis face. He was more hideous still, thus flattened out, with his jaw\r\nprojecting, and his visage deformed like a corpse\xe2\x80\x99s that had suffered\r\nfrom nightmare; but the doctors, having caught sight of his feet, went\r\nand poked their noses over them, with an air of profound interest. The\r\nfeet were still dancing. Though Coupeau slept the feet danced. Oh!\r\ntheir owner might snore, that did not concern them, they continued\r\ntheir little occupation without either hurrying or slackening. Regular\r\nmechanical feet, feet which took their pleasure wherever they found it.\r\n\r\nGervaise having seen the doctors place their hands on her old man,\r\nwished to feel him also. She approached gently and laid a hand on his\r\nshoulder, and she kept it there a minute. _Mon Dieu!_ whatever was\r\ntaking place inside? It danced down into the very depths of the flesh,\r\nthe bones themselves must have been jumping. Quiverings, undulations,\r\ncoming from afar, flowed like a river beneath the skin. When she\r\npressed a little she felt she distinguished the suffering cries of the\r\nmarrow. What a fearful thing, something was boring away like a mole! It\r\nmust be the rotgut from l\xe2\x80\x99Assommoir that was hacking away inside him.\r\nWell! his entire body had been soaked in it.\r\n\r\nThe doctors had gone away. At the end of an hour Gervaise, who had\r\nremained with the house surgeon, repeated in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead, sir; he\xe2\x80\x99s dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the house surgeon, who was watching the feet, shook his head. The\r\nbare feet, projecting beyond the mattress, still danced on. They were\r\nnot particularly clean and the nails were long. Several more hours\r\npassed. All on a sudden they stiffened and became motionless. Then the\r\nhouse surgeon turned towards Gervaise, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeath alone had been able to stop those feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Gervaise got back to the Rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or she found at the\r\nBoches\xe2\x80\x99 a number of women who were cackling in excited tones. She\r\nthought they were awaiting her to have the latest news, the same as the\r\nother days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, quietly, as she pushed open the door, looking\r\ntired out and dull.\r\n\r\nBut no one listened to her. The whole building was topsy-turvy. Oh! a\r\nmost extraordinary story. Poisson had caught his wife with Lantier.\r\nExact details were not known, because everyone had a different version.\r\nHowever, he had appeared just when they were not expecting him. Some\r\nfurther information was given, which the ladies repeated to one another\r\nas they pursed their lips. A sight like that had naturally brought\r\nPoisson out of his shell. He was a regular tiger. This man, who talked\r\nbut little and who always seemed to walk with a stick up his back, had\r\nbegun to roar and jump about. Then nothing more had been heard. Lantier\r\nhad evidently explained things to the husband. Anyhow, it could not\r\nlast much longer, and Boche announced that the girl of the restaurant\r\nwas for certain going to take the shop for selling tripe. That rogue of\r\na hatter adored tripe.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Madame Lorilleux and Madame Lerat arrive, Gervaise repeated,\r\nfaintly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gone. _Mon Dieu!_ Four days\xe2\x80\x99 dancing and yelling\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the two sisters could not do otherwise than pull out their\r\nhandkerchiefs. Their brother had had many faults, but after all he was\r\ntheir brother. Boche shrugged his shoulders and said, loud enough to be\r\nheard by everyone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! It\xe2\x80\x99s a drunkard the less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom that day, as Gervaise often got a bit befuddled, one of the\r\namusements of the house was to see her imitate Coupeau. It was no\r\nlonger necessary to press her; she gave the performance gratis, her\r\nhands and feet trembling as she uttered little involuntary shrieks. She\r\nmust have caught this habit at Sainte-Anne from watching her husband\r\ntoo long.\r\n\r\nGervaise lasted in this state several months. She fell lower and lower\r\nstill, submitting to the grossest outrages and dying of starvation a\r\nlittle every day. As soon as she had four sous she drank and pounded on\r\nthe walls. She was employed on all the dirty errands of the\r\nneighborhood. Once they even bet her she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat filth, but she\r\ndid it in order to earn ten sous. Monsieur Marescot had decided to turn\r\nher out of her room on the sixth floor. But, as Pere Bru had just been\r\nfound dead in his cubbyhole under the staircase, the landlord had\r\nallowed her to turn into it. Now she roosted there in the place of Pere\r\nBru. It was inside there, on some straw, that her teeth chattered,\r\nwhilst her stomach was empty and her bones were frozen. The earth would\r\nnot have her apparently. She was becoming idiotic. She did not even\r\nthink of making an end of herself by jumping out of the sixth floor\r\nwindow on to the pavement of the courtyard below. Death had to take her\r\nlittle by little, bit by bit, dragging her thus to the end through the\r\naccursed existence she had made for herself. It was never even exactly\r\nknown what she did die of. There was some talk of a cold, but the truth\r\nwas she died of privation and of the filth and hardship of her ruined\r\nlife. Overeating and dissoluteness killed her, according to the\r\nLorilleuxs. One morning, as there was a bad smell in the passage, it\r\nwas remembered that she had not been seen for two days, and she was\r\ndiscovered already green in her hole.\r\n\r\nIt happened to be old Bazouge who came with the pauper\xe2\x80\x99s coffin under\r\nhis arm to pack her up. He was again precious drunk that day, but a\r\njolly fellow all the same, and as lively as a cricket. When he\r\nrecognized the customer he had to deal with he uttered several\r\nphilosophical reflections, whilst performing his little business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has to go. There\xe2\x80\x99s no occasion for jostling, there\xe2\x80\x99s room for\r\neveryone. And it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid being in a hurry that just slows you up. All\r\nI want to do is to please everybody. Some will, others won\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe result? Here\xe2\x80\x99s one who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, then she would. So she was made to\r\nwait. Anyhow, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right now, and faith! She\xe2\x80\x99s earned it! Merrily,\r\njust take it easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when he took hold of Gervaise in his big, dirty hands, he was\r\nseized with emotion, and he gently raised this woman who had had so\r\ngreat a longing for his attentions. Then, as he laid her out with\r\npaternal care at the bottom of the coffin, he stuttered between two\r\nhiccoughs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know\xe2\x80\x94now listen\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s me, Bibi-the-Gay, called the ladies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconsoler. There, you\xe2\x80\x99re happy now. Go by-by, my beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK L\xe2\x80\x99ASSOMMOIR ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
