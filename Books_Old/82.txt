It was plain,\r\nhowever, that frequent publication must finally wear out the public\r\nfavour, unless some mode could be devised to give an appearance of\r\nnovelty to subsequent productions. Scottish manners, Scottish dialect,\r\nand Scottish characters of note, being those with which the author was\r\nmost intimately, and familiarly acquainted, were the groundwork upon\r\nwhich he had hitherto relied for giving effect to his narrative. It\r\nwas, however, obvious, that this kind of interest must in the end\r\noccasion a degree of sameness and repetition, if exclusively resorted\r\nto, and that the reader was likely at length to adopt the language of\r\nEdwin, in Parnell\xe2\x80\x99s Tale:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Reverse the spell,\xe2\x80\x99 he cries,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And let it fairly now suffice.\r\nThe gambol has been shown.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing can be more dangerous for the fame of a professor of the fine\r\narts, than to permit (if he can possibly prevent it) the character of a\r\nmannerist to be attached to him, or that he should be supposed capable\r\nof success only in a particular and limited style. The public are, in\r\ngeneral, very ready to adopt the opinion, that he who has pleased them\r\nin one peculiar mode of composition, is, by means of that very talent,\r\nrendered incapable of venturing upon other subjects. The effect of this\r\ndisinclination, on the part of the public, towards the artificers of\r\ntheir pleasures, when they attempt to enlarge their means of amusing,\r\nmay be seen in the censures usually passed by vulgar criticism upon\r\nactors or artists who venture to change the character of their efforts,\r\nthat, in so doing, they may enlarge the scale of their art.\r\n\r\nThere is some justice in this opinion, as there always is in such as\r\nattain general currency. It may often happen on the stage, that an\r\nactor, by possessing in a preeminent degree the external qualities\r\nnecessary to give effect to comedy, may be deprived of the right to\r\naspire to tragic excellence; and in painting or literary composition,\r\nan artist or poet may be master exclusively of modes of thought, and\r\npowers of expression, which confine him to a single course of subjects.\r\nBut much more frequently the same capacity which carries a man to\r\npopularity in one department will obtain for him success in another,\r\nand that must be more particularly the case in literary composition,\r\nthan either in acting or painting, because the adventurer in that\r\ndepartment is not impeded in his exertions by any peculiarity of\r\nfeatures, or conformation of person, proper for particular parts, or,\r\nby any peculiar mechanical habits of using the pencil, limited to a\r\nparticular class of subjects.\r\n\r\nWhether this reasoning be correct or otherwise, the present author\r\nfelt, that, in confining himself to subjects purely Scottish, he was\r\nnot only likely to weary out the indulgence of his readers, but also\r\ngreatly to limit his own power of affording them pleasure. In a highly\r\npolished country, where so much genius is monthly employed in catering\r\nfor public amusement, a fresh topic, such as he had himself had the\r\nhappiness to light upon, is the untasted spring of the desert;\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen bless their stars and call it luxury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when men and horses, cattle, camels, and dromedaries, have poached\r\nthe spring into mud, it becomes loathsome to those who at first drank\r\nof it with rapture; and he who had the merit of discovering it, if he\r\nwould preserve his reputation with the tribe, must display his talent\r\nby a fresh discovery of untasted fountains.\r\n\r\nIf the author, who finds himself limited to a particular class of\r\nsubjects, endeavours to sustain his reputation by striving to add a\r\nnovelty of attraction to themes of the same character which have been\r\nformerly successful under his management, there are manifest reasons\r\nwhy, after a certain point, he is likely to fail. If the mine be not\r\nwrought out, the strength and capacity of the miner become necessarily\r\nexhausted. If he closely imitates the narratives which he has before\r\nrendered successful, he is doomed to \xe2\x80\x9cwonder that they please no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIf he struggles to take a different view of the same class of subjects,\r\nhe speedily discovers that what is obvious, graceful, and natural, has\r\nbeen exhausted; and, in order to obtain the indispensable charm of\r\nnovelty, he is forced upon caricature, and, to avoid being trite, must\r\nbecome extravagant.\r\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, necessary to enumerate so many reasons why the\r\nauthor of the Scottish Novels, as they were then exclusively termed,\r\nshould be desirous to make an experiment on a subject purely English.\r\nIt was his purpose, at the same time, to have rendered the experiment\r\nas complete as possible, by bringing the intended work before the\r\npublic as the effort of a new candidate for their favour, in order that\r\nno degree of prejudice, whether favourable or the reverse, might attach\r\nto it, as a new production of the Author of Waverley; but this\r\nintention was afterwards departed from, for reasons to be hereafter\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe period of the narrative adopted was the reign of Richard I., not\r\nonly as abounding with characters whose very names were sure to attract\r\ngeneral attention, but as affording a striking contrast betwixt the\r\nSaxons, by whom the soil was cultivated, and the Normans, who still\r\nreigned in it as conquerors, reluctant to mix with the vanquished, or\r\nacknowledge themselves of the same stock. The idea of this contrast was\r\ntaken from the ingenious and unfortunate Logan\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy of Runnamede,\r\nin which, about the same period of history, the author had seen the\r\nSaxon and Norman barons opposed to each other on different sides of the\r\nstage. He does not recollect that there was any attempt to contrast the\r\ntwo races in their habits and sentiments; and indeed it was obvious,\r\nthat history was violated by introducing the Saxons still existing as a\r\nhigh-minded and martial race of nobles.\r\n\r\nThey did, however, survive as a people, and some of the ancient Saxon\r\nfamilies possessed wealth and power, although they were exceptions to\r\nthe humble condition of the race in general. It seemed to the author,\r\nthat the existence of the two races in the same country, the vanquished\r\ndistinguished by their plain, homely, blunt manners, and the free\r\nspirit infused by their ancient institutions and laws; the victors, by\r\nthe high spirit of military fame, personal adventure, and whatever\r\ncould distinguish them as the Flower of Chivalry, might, intermixed\r\nwith other characters belonging to the same time and country, interest\r\nthe reader by the contrast, if the author should not fail on his part.\r\n\r\nScotland, however, had been of late used so exclusively as the scene of\r\nwhat is called Historical Romance, that the preliminary letter of Mr\r\nLaurence Templeton became in some measure necessary. To this, as to an\r\nIntroduction, the reader is referred, as expressing the author\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurpose and opinions in undertaking this species of composition, under\r\nthe necessary reservation, that he is far from thinking he has attained\r\nthe point at which he aimed.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that there was no idea or wish to pass\r\noff the supposed Mr Templeton as a real person. But a kind of\r\ncontinuation of the Tales of my Landlord had been recently attempted by\r\na stranger, and it was supposed this Dedicatory Epistle might pass for\r\nsome imitation of the same kind, and thus putting enquirers upon a\r\nfalse scent, induce them to believe they had before them the work of\r\nsome new candidate for their favour.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable part of the work had been finished and printed,\r\nthe Publishers, who pretended to discern in it a germ of popularity,\r\nremonstrated strenuously against its appearing as an absolutely\r\nanonymous production, and contended that it should have the advantage\r\nof being announced as by the Author of Waverley. The author did not\r\nmake any obstinate opposition, for he began to be of opinion with Dr\r\nWheeler, in Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s excellent tale of \xe2\x80\x9cManeuvering,\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrick upon Trick\xe2\x80\x9d might be too much for the patience of an indulgent\r\npublic, and might be reasonably considered as trifling with their\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nThe book, therefore, appeared as an avowed continuation of the Waverley\r\nNovels; and it would be ungrateful not to acknowledge, that it met with\r\nthe same favourable reception as its predecessors.\r\n\r\nSuch annotations as may be useful to assist the reader in comprehending\r\nthe characters of the Jew, the Templar, the Captain of the mercenaries,\r\nor Free Companions, as they were called, and others proper to the\r\nperiod, are added, but with a sparing hand, since sufficient\r\ninformation on these subjects is to be found in general history.\r\n\r\nAn incident in the tale, which had the good fortune to find favour in\r\nthe eyes of many readers, is more directly borrowed from the stores of\r\nold romance. I mean the meeting of the King with Friar Tuck at the cell\r\nof that buxom hermit. The general tone of the story belongs to all\r\nranks and all countries, which emulate each other in describing the\r\nrambles of a disguised sovereign, who, going in search of information\r\nor amusement, into the lower ranks of life, meets with adventures\r\ndiverting to the reader or hearer, from the contrast betwixt the\r\nmonarch\xe2\x80\x99s outward appearance, and his real character. The Eastern\r\ntale-teller has for his theme the disguised expeditions of Haroun\r\nAlraschid with his faithful attendants, Mesrour and Giafar, through the\r\nmidnight streets of Bagdad; and Scottish tradition dwells upon the\r\nsimilar exploits of James V., distinguished during such excursions by\r\nthe travelling name of the Goodman of Ballengeigh, as the Commander of\r\nthe Faithful, when he desired to be incognito, was known by that of Il\r\nBondocani. The French minstrels are not silent on so popular a theme.\r\nThere must have been a Norman original of the Scottish metrical romance\r\nof Rauf Colziar, in which Charlemagne is introduced as the unknown\r\nguest of a charcoal-man. 2\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been the original of other poems of the kind.\r\n\r\nIn merry England there is no end of popular ballads on this theme. The\r\npoem of John the Reeve, or Steward, mentioned by Bishop Percy, in the\r\nReliques of English Poetry, 3 is said to have turned on such an\r\nincident; and we have besides, the King and the Tanner of Tamworth, the\r\nKing and the Miller of Mansfield, and others on the same topic. But the\r\npeculiar tale of this nature to which the author of Ivanhoe has to\r\nacknowledge an obligation, is more ancient by two centuries than any of\r\nthese last mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt was first communicated to the public in that curious record of\r\nancient literature, which has been accumulated by the combined\r\nexertions of Sir Egerton Brydges and Mr Hazlewood, in the periodical\r\nwork entitled the British Bibliographer. From thence it has been\r\ntransferred by the Reverend Charles Henry Hartshorne, M.A., editor of a\r\nvery curious volume, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAncient Metrical Tales, printed chiefly\r\nfrom original sources, 1829.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Hartshorne gives no other authority\r\nfor the present fragment, except the article in the Bibliographer,\r\nwhere it is entitled the Kyng and the Hermite. A short abstract of its\r\ncontents will show its similarity to the meeting of King Richard and\r\nFriar Tuck.\r\n\r\nKing Edward (we are not told which among the monarchs of that name,\r\nbut, from his temper and habits, we may suppose Edward IV.) sets forth\r\nwith his court to a gallant hunting-match in Sherwood Forest, in which,\r\nas is not unusual for princes in romance, he falls in with a deer of\r\nextraordinary size and swiftness, and pursues it closely, till he has\r\noutstripped his whole retinue, tired out hounds and horse, and finds\r\nhimself alone under the gloom of an extensive forest, upon which night\r\nis descending. Under the apprehensions natural to a situation so\r\nuncomfortable, the king recollects that he has heard how poor men, when\r\napprehensive of a bad nights lodging, pray to Saint Julian, who, in the\r\nRomish calendar, stands Quarter-Master-General to all forlorn\r\ntravellers that render him due homage. Edward puts up his orisons\r\naccordingly, and by the guidance, doubtless, of the good Saint, reaches\r\na small path, conducting him to a chapel in the forest, having a\r\nhermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell in its close vicinity. The King hears the reverend man,\r\nwith a companion of his solitude, telling his beads within, and meekly\r\nrequests of him quarters for the night. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no accommodation for\r\nsuch a lord as ye be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Hermit. \xe2\x80\x9cI live here in the wilderness\r\nupon roots and rinds, and may not receive into my dwelling even the\r\npoorest wretch that lives, unless it were to save his life.\xe2\x80\x9d The King\r\nenquires the way to the next town, and, understanding it is by a road\r\nwhich he cannot find without difficulty, even if he had daylight to\r\nbefriend him, he declares, that with or without the Hermit\xe2\x80\x99s consent,\r\nhe is determined to be his guest that night. He is admitted\r\naccordingly, not without a hint from the Recluse, that were he himself\r\nout of his priestly weeds, he would care little for his threats of\r\nusing violence, and that he gives way to him not out of intimidation,\r\nbut simply to avoid scandal.\r\n\r\nThe King is admitted into the cell\xe2\x80\x94two bundles of straw are shaken down\r\nfor his accommodation, and he comforts himself that he is now under\r\nshelter, and that\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA night will soon be gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nOther wants, however, arise. The guest becomes clamorous for supper,\r\nobserving,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor certainly, as I you say,\r\nI ne had never so sorry a day,\r\n    That I ne had a merry night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this indication of his taste for good cheer, joined to the\r\nannunciation of his being a follower of the Court, who had lost himself\r\nat the great hunting-match, cannot induce the niggard Hermit to produce\r\nbetter fare than bread and cheese, for which his guest showed little\r\nappetite; and \xe2\x80\x9cthin drink,\xe2\x80\x9d which was even less acceptable. At length\r\nthe King presses his host on a point to which he had more than once\r\nalluded, without obtaining a satisfactory reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen said the King, \xe2\x80\x98by God\xe2\x80\x99s grace,\r\nThou wert in a merry place,\r\n    To shoot should thou here\r\nWhen the foresters go to rest,\r\nSometyme thou might have of the best,\r\n    All of the wild deer;\r\nI wold hold it for no scathe,\r\nThough thou hadst bow and arrows baith,\r\n    Althoff thou best a Frere.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hermit, in return, expresses his apprehension that his guest means\r\nto drag him into some confession of offence against the forest laws,\r\nwhich, being betrayed to the King, might cost him his life. Edward\r\nanswers by fresh assurances of secrecy, and again urges on him the\r\nnecessity of procuring some venison. The Hermit replies, by once more\r\ninsisting on the duties incumbent upon him as a churchman, and\r\ncontinues to affirm himself free from all such breaches of order:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany day I have here been,\r\nAnd flesh-meat I eat never,\r\n    But milk of the kye;\r\nWarm thee well, and go to sleep,\r\nAnd I will lap thee with my cope,\r\n    Softly to lye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect, for we do not find\r\nthe reasons which finally induce the curtal Friar to amend the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheer. But acknowledging his guest to be such a \xe2\x80\x9cgood fellow\xe2\x80\x9d as has\r\nseldom graced his board, the holy man at length produces the best his\r\ncell affords. Two candles are placed on a table, white bread and baked\r\npasties are displayed by the light, besides choice of venison, both\r\nsalt and fresh, from which they select collops. \xe2\x80\x9cI might have eaten my\r\nbread dry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9chad I not pressed thee on the score of\r\narchery, but now have I dined like a prince\xe2\x80\x94if we had but drink enow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis too is afforded by the hospitable anchorite, who dispatches an\r\nassistant to fetch a pot of four gallons from a secret corner near his\r\nbed, and the whole three set in to serious drinking. This amusement is\r\nsuperintended by the Friar, according to the recurrence of certain\r\nfustian words, to be repeated by every compotator in turn before he\r\ndrank\xe2\x80\x94a species of High Jinks, as it were, by which they regulated\r\ntheir potations, as toasts were given in latter times. The one toper\r\nsays \xe2\x80\x9cfusty bandias\xe2\x80\x9d, to which the other is obliged to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cstrike\r\npantnere\xe2\x80\x9d, and the Friar passes many jests on the King\xe2\x80\x99s want of\r\nmemory, who sometimes forgets the words of action. The night is spent\r\nin this jolly pastime. Before his departure in the morning, the King\r\ninvites his reverend host to Court, promises, at least, to requite his\r\nhospitality, and expresses himself much pleased with his entertainment.\r\nThe jolly Hermit at length agrees to venture thither, and to enquire\r\nfor Jack Fletcher, which is the name assumed by the King. After the\r\nHermit has shown Edward some feats of archery, the joyous pair\r\nseparate. The King rides home, and rejoins his retinue. As the romance\r\nis imperfect, we are not acquainted how the discovery takes place; but\r\nit is probably much in the same manner as in other narratives turning\r\non the same subject, where the host, apprehensive of death for having\r\ntrespassed on the respect due to his Sovereign, while incognito, is\r\nagreeably surprised by receiving honours and reward.\r\n\r\nIn Mr Hartshorne\xe2\x80\x99s collection, there is a romance on the same\r\nfoundation, called King Edward and the Shepherd,4 which, considered as\r\nillustrating manners, is still more curious than the King and the\r\nHermit; but it is foreign to the present purpose. The reader has here\r\nthe original legend from which the incident in the romance is derived;\r\nand the identifying the irregular Eremite with the Friar Tuck of Robin\r\nHood\xe2\x80\x99s story, was an obvious expedient.\r\n\r\nThe name of Ivanhoe was suggested by an old rhyme. All novelists have\r\nhad occasion at some time or other to wish with Falstaff, that they\r\nknew where a commodity of good names was to be had. On such an occasion\r\nthe author chanced to call to memory a rhyme recording three names of\r\nthe manors forfeited by the ancestor of the celebrated Hampden, for\r\nstriking the Black Prince a blow with his racket, when they quarrelled\r\nat tennis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTring, Wing, and Ivanhoe,\r\nFor striking of a blow,\r\nHampden did forego,\r\nAnd glad he could escape so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word suited the author\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in two material respects,\xe2\x80\x94for,\r\nfirst, it had an ancient English sound; and secondly, it conveyed no\r\nindication whatever of the nature of the story. He presumes to hold\r\nthis last quality to be of no small importance. What is called a taking\r\ntitle, serves the direct interest of the bookseller or publisher, who\r\nby this means sometimes sells an edition while it is yet passing the\r\npress. But if the author permits an over degree of attention to be\r\ndrawn to his work ere it has appeared, he places himself in the\r\nembarrassing condition of having excited a degree of expectation which,\r\nif he proves unable to satisfy, is an error fatal to his literary\r\nreputation. Besides, when we meet such a title as the Gunpowder Plot,\r\nor any other connected with general history, each reader, before he has\r\nseen the book, has formed to himself some particular idea of the sort\r\nof manner in which the story is to be conducted, and the nature of the\r\namusement which he is to derive from it. In this he is probably\r\ndisappointed, and in that case may be naturally disposed to visit upon\r\nthe author or the work, the unpleasant feelings thus excited. In such a\r\ncase the literary adventurer is censured, not for having missed the\r\nmark at which he himself aimed, but for not having shot off his shaft\r\nin a direction he never thought of.\r\n\r\nOn the footing of unreserved communication which the Author has\r\nestablished with the reader, he may here add the trifling circumstance,\r\nthat a roll of Norman warriors, occurring in the Auchinleck Manuscript,\r\ngave him the formidable name of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\r\n\r\nIvanhoe was highly successful upon its appearance, and may be said to\r\nhave procured for its author the freedom of the Rules, since he has\r\never since been permitted to exercise his powers of fictitious\r\ncomposition in England, as well as Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe character of the fair Jewess found so much favour in the eyes of\r\nsome fair readers, that the writer was censured, because, when\r\narranging the fates of the characters of the drama, he had not assigned\r\nthe hand of Wilfred to Rebecca, rather than the less interesting\r\nRowena. But, not to mention that the prejudices of the age rendered\r\nsuch an union almost impossible, the author may, in passing, observe,\r\nthat he thinks a character of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp, is\r\ndegraded rather than exalted by an attempt to reward virtue with\r\ntemporal prosperity. Such is not the recompense which Providence has\r\ndeemed worthy of suffering merit, and it is a dangerous and fatal\r\ndoctrine to teach young persons, the most common readers of romance,\r\nthat rectitude of conduct and of principle are either naturally allied\r\nwith, or adequately rewarded by, the gratification of our passions, or\r\nattainment of our wishes. In a word, if a virtuous and self-denied\r\ncharacter is dismissed with temporal wealth, greatness, rank, or the\r\nindulgence of such a rashly formed or ill assorted passion as that of\r\nRebecca for Ivanhoe, the reader will be apt to say, verily Virtue has\r\nhad its reward. But a glance on the great picture of life will show,\r\nthat the duties of self-denial, and the sacrifice of passion to\r\nprinciple, are seldom thus remunerated; and that the internal\r\nconsciousness of their high-minded discharge of duty, produces on their\r\nown reflections a more adequate recompense, in the form of that peace\r\nwhich the world cannot give or take away.\r\n\r\nAbbotsford, 1_st September_, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATORY EPISTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTO\r\nTHE REV. DR DRYASDUST, F.A.S.\r\nResiding in the Castle-Gate, York.\r\n\r\nMuch esteemed and dear Sir,\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to mention the various and concurring reasons\r\nwhich induce me to place your name at the head of the following work.\r\nYet the chief of these reasons may perhaps be refuted by the\r\nimperfections of the performance. Could I have hoped to render it\r\nworthy of your patronage, the public would at once have seen the\r\npropriety of inscribing a work designed to illustrate the domestic\r\nantiquities of England, and particularly of our Saxon forefathers, to\r\nthe learned author of the Essays upon the Horn of King Ulphus, and on\r\nthe Lands bestowed by him upon the patrimony of St Peter. I am\r\nconscious, however, that the slight, unsatisfactory, and trivial\r\nmanner, in which the result of my antiquarian researches has been\r\nrecorded in the following pages, takes the work from under that class\r\nwhich bears the proud motto, \xe2\x80\x9cDetur digniori\xe2\x80\x9d. On the contrary, I fear\r\nI shall incur the censure of presumption in placing the venerable name\r\nof Dr Jonas Dryasdust at the head of a publication, which the more\r\ngrave antiquary will perhaps class with the idle novels and romances of\r\nthe day. I am anxious to vindicate myself from such a charge; for\r\nalthough I might trust to your friendship for an apology in your eyes,\r\nyet I would not willingly stand conviction in those of the public of so\r\ngrave a crime, as my fears lead me to anticipate my being charged with.\r\n\r\nI must therefore remind you, that when we first talked over together\r\nthat class of productions, in one of which the private and family\r\naffairs of your learned northern friend, Mr Oldbuck of Monkbarns, were\r\nso unjustifiably exposed to the public, some discussion occurred\r\nbetween us concerning the cause of the popularity these works have\r\nattained in this idle age, which, whatever other merit they possess,\r\nmust be admitted to be hastily written, and in violation of every rule\r\nassigned to the epopeia. It seemed then to be your opinion, that the\r\ncharm lay entirely in the art with which the unknown author had availed\r\nhimself, like a second M\xe2\x80\x99Pherson, of the antiquarian stores which lay\r\nscattered around him, supplying his own indolence or poverty of\r\ninvention, by the incidents which had actually taken place in his\r\ncountry at no distant period, by introducing real characters, and\r\nscarcely suppressing real names. It was not above sixty or seventy\r\nyears, you observed, since the whole north of Scotland was under a\r\nstate of government nearly as simple and as patriarchal as those of our\r\ngood allies the Mohawks and Iroquois. Admitting that the author cannot\r\nhimself be supposed to have witnessed those times, he must have lived,\r\nyou observed, among persons who had acted and suffered in them; and\r\neven within these thirty years, such an infinite change has taken place\r\nin the manners of Scotland, that men look back upon the habits of\r\nsociety proper to their immediate ancestors, as we do on those of the\r\nreign of Queen Anne, or even the period of the Revolution. Having thus\r\nmaterials of every kind lying strewed around him, there was little, you\r\nobserved, to embarrass the author, but the difficulty of choice. It was\r\nno wonder, therefore, that, having begun to work a mine so plentiful,\r\nhe should have derived from his works fully more credit and profit than\r\nthe facility of his labours merited.\r\n\r\nAdmitting (as I could not deny) the general truth of these conclusions,\r\nI cannot but think it strange that no attempt has been made to excite\r\nan interest for the traditions and manners of Old England, similiar to\r\nthat which has been obtained in behalf of those of our poorer and less\r\ncelebrated neighbours. The Kendal green, though its date is more\r\nancient, ought surely to be as dear to our feelings, as the variegated\r\ntartans of the north. The name of Robin Hood, if duly conjured with,\r\nshould raise a spirit as soon as that of Rob Roy; and the patriots of\r\nEngland deserve no less their renown in our modern circles, than the\r\nBruces and Wallaces of Caledonia. If the scenery of the south be less\r\nromantic and sublime than that of the northern mountains, it must be\r\nallowed to possess in the same proportion superior softness and beauty;\r\nand upon the whole, we feel ourselves entitled to exclaim with the\r\npatriotic Syrian\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAre not Pharphar and Abana, rivers of Damascus,\r\nbetter than all the rivers of Israel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYour objections to such an attempt, my dear Doctor, were, you may\r\nremember, two-fold. You insisted upon the advantages which the Scotsman\r\npossessed, from the very recent existence of that state of society in\r\nwhich his scene was to be laid. Many now alive, you remarked, well\r\nremembered persons who had not only seen the celebrated Roy M\xe2\x80\x99Gregor,\r\nbut had feasted, and even fought with him. All those minute\r\ncircumstances belonging to private life and domestic character, all\r\nthat gives verisimilitude to a narrative, and individuality to the\r\npersons introduced, is still known and remembered in Scotland; whereas\r\nin England, civilisation has been so long complete, that our ideas of\r\nour ancestors are only to be gleaned from musty records and chronicles,\r\nthe authors of which seem perversely to have conspired to suppress in\r\ntheir narratives all interesting details, in order to find room for\r\nflowers of monkish eloquence, or trite reflections upon morals. To\r\nmatch an English and a Scottish author in the rival task of embodying\r\nand reviving the traditions of their respective countries, would be,\r\nyou alleged, in the highest degree unequal and unjust. The Scottish\r\nmagician, you said, was, like Lucan\xe2\x80\x99s witch, at liberty to walk over\r\nthe recent field of battle, and to select for the subject of\r\nresuscitation by his sorceries, a body whose limbs had recently\r\nquivered with existence, and whose throat had but just uttered the last\r\nnote of agony. Such a subject even the powerful Erictho was compelled\r\nto select, as alone capable of being reanimated even by \xe2\x80\x9cher\xe2\x80\x9d potent\r\nmagic\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94gelidas leto scrutata medullas,\r\nPulmonis rigidi stantes sine vulnere fibras\r\nInvenit, et vocem defuncto in corpore quaerit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English author, on the other hand, without supposing him less of a\r\nconjuror than the Northern Warlock, can, you observed, only have the\r\nliberty of selecting his subject amidst the dust of antiquity, where\r\nnothing was to be found but dry, sapless, mouldering, and disjointed\r\nbones, such as those which filled the valley of Jehoshaphat. You\r\nexpressed, besides, your apprehension, that the unpatriotic prejudices\r\nof my countrymen would not allow fair play to such a work as that of\r\nwhich I endeavoured to demonstrate the probable success. And this, you\r\nsaid, was not entirely owing to the more general prejudice in favour of\r\nthat which is foreign, but that it rested partly upon improbabilities,\r\narising out of the circumstances in which the English reader is placed.\r\nIf you describe to him a set of wild manners, and a state of primitive\r\nsociety existing in the Highlands of Scotland, he is much disposed to\r\nacquiesce in the truth of what is asserted. And reason good. If he be\r\nof the ordinary class of readers, he has either never seen those remote\r\ndistricts at all, or he has wandered through those desolate regions in\r\nthe course of a summer tour, eating bad dinners, sleeping on truckle\r\nbeds, stalking from desolation to desolation, and fully prepared to\r\nbelieve the strangest things that could be told him of a people, wild\r\nand extravagant enough to be attached to scenery so extraordinary. But\r\nthe same worthy person, when placed in his own snug parlour, and\r\nsurrounded by all the comforts of an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s fireside, is not half\r\nso much disposed to believe that his own ancestors led a very different\r\nlife from himself; that the shattered tower, which now forms a vista\r\nfrom his window, once held a baron who would have hung him up at his\r\nown door without any form of trial; that the hinds, by whom his little\r\npet-farm is managed, a few centuries ago would have been his slaves;\r\nand that the complete influence of feudal tyranny once extended over\r\nthe neighbouring village, where the attorney is now a man of more\r\nimportance than the lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nWhile I own the force of these objections, I must confess, at the same\r\ntime, that they do not appear to me to be altogether insurmountable.\r\nThe scantiness of materials is indeed a formidable difficulty; but no\r\none knows better than Dr Dryasdust, that to those deeply read in\r\nantiquity, hints concerning the private life of our ancestors lie\r\nscattered through the pages of our various historians, bearing, indeed,\r\na slender proportion to the other matters of which they treat, but\r\nstill, when collected together, sufficient to throw considerable light\r\nupon the _vie priv\xc3\xa9e_ of our forefathers; indeed, I am convinced, that\r\nhowever I myself may fail in the ensuing attempt, yet, with more labour\r\nin collecting, or more skill in using, the materials within his reach,\r\nillustrated as they have been by the labours of Dr Henry, of the late\r\nMr Strutt, and, above all, of Mr Sharon Turner, an abler hand would\r\nhave been successful; and therefore I protest, beforehand, against any\r\nargument which may be founded on the failure of the present experiment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have already said, that if any thing like a true\r\npicture of old English manners could be drawn, I would trust to the\r\ngood-nature and good sense of my countrymen for insuring its favourable\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nHaving thus replied, to the best of my power, to the first class of\r\nyour objections, or at least having shown my resolution to overleap the\r\nbarriers which your prudence has raised, I will be brief in noticing\r\nthat which is more peculiar to myself. It seems to be your opinion,\r\nthat the very office of an antiquary, employed in grave, and, as the\r\nvulgar will sometimes allege, in toilsome and minute research, must be\r\nconsidered as incapacitating him from successfully compounding a tale\r\nof this sort. But permit me to say, my dear Doctor, that this objection\r\nis rather formal than substantial. It is true, that such slight\r\ncompositions might not suit the severer genius of our friend Mr\r\nOldbuck. Yet Horace Walpole wrote a goblin tale which has thrilled\r\nthrough many a bosom; and George Ellis could transfer all the playful\r\nfascination of a humour, as delightful as it was uncommon, into his\r\nAbridgement of the Ancient Metrical Romances. So that, however I may\r\nhave occasion to rue my present audacity, I have at least the most\r\nrespectable precedents in my favour.\r\n\r\nStill the severer antiquary may think, that, by thus intermingling\r\nfiction with truth, I am polluting the well of history with modern\r\ninventions, and impressing upon the rising generation false ideas of\r\nthe age which I describe. I cannot but in some sense admit the force of\r\nthis reasoning, which I yet hope to traverse by the following\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that I neither can, nor do pretend, to the observation of\r\ncomplete accuracy, even in matters of outward costume, much less in the\r\nmore important points of language and manners. But the same motive\r\nwhich prevents my writing the dialogue of the piece in Anglo-Saxon or\r\nin Norman-French, and which prohibits my sending forth to the public\r\nthis essay printed with the types of Caxton or Wynken de Worde,\r\nprevents my attempting to confine myself within the limits of the\r\nperiod in which my story is laid. It is necessary, for exciting\r\ninterest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were,\r\ntranslated into the manners, as well as the language, of the age we\r\nlive in. No fascination has ever been attached to Oriental literature,\r\nequal to that produced by Mr Galland\xe2\x80\x99s first translation of the Arabian\r\nTales; in which, retaining on the one hand the splendour of Eastern\r\ncostume, and on the other the wildness of Eastern fiction, he mixed\r\nthese with just so much ordinary feeling and expression, as rendered\r\nthem interesting and intelligible, while he abridged the long-winded\r\nnarratives, curtailed the monotonous reflections, and rejected the\r\nendless repetitions of the Arabian original. The tales, therefore,\r\nthough less purely Oriental than in their first concoction, were\r\neminently better fitted for the European market, and obtained an\r\nunrivalled degree of public favour, which they certainly would never\r\nhave gained had not the manners and style been in some degree\r\nfamiliarized to the feelings and habits of the western reader.\r\n\r\nIn point of justice, therefore, to the multitudes who will, I trust,\r\ndevour this book with avidity, I have so far explained our ancient\r\nmanners in modern language, and so far detailed the characters and\r\nsentiments of my persons, that the modern reader will not find himself,\r\nI should hope, much trammelled by the repulsive dryness of mere\r\nantiquity. In this, I respectfully contend, I have in no respect\r\nexceeded the fair license due to the author of a fictitious\r\ncomposition. The late ingenious Mr Strutt, in his romance of\r\nQueen-Hoo-Hall, 5 acted upon another principle; and in distinguishing\r\nbetween what was ancient and modern, forgot, as it appears to me, that\r\nextensive neutral ground, the large proportion, that is, of manners and\r\nsentiments which are common to us and to our ancestors, having been\r\nhanded down unaltered from them to us, or which, arising out of the\r\nprinciples of our common nature, must have existed alike in either\r\nstate of society. In this manner, a man of talent, and of great\r\nantiquarian erudition, limited the popularity of his work, by excluding\r\nfrom it every thing which was not sufficiently obsolete to be\r\naltogether forgotten and unintelligible.\r\n\r\nThe license which I would here vindicate, is so necessary to the\r\nexecution of my plan, that I will crave your patience while I\r\nillustrate my argument a little farther.\r\n\r\nHe who first opens Chaucer, or any other ancient poet, is so much\r\nstruck with the obsolete spelling, multiplied consonants, and\r\nantiquated appearance of the language, that he is apt to lay the work\r\ndown in despair, as encrusted too deep with the rust of antiquity, to\r\npermit his judging of its merits or tasting its beauties. But if some\r\nintelligent and accomplished friend points out to him, that the\r\ndifficulties by which he is startled are more in appearance than\r\nreality, if, by reading aloud to him, or by reducing the ordinary words\r\nto the modern orthography, he satisfies his proselyte that only about\r\none-tenth part of the words employed are in fact obsolete, the novice\r\nmay be easily persuaded to approach the \xe2\x80\x9cwell of English undefiled,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith the certainty that a slender degree of patience will enable him to\r\nto enjoy both the humour and the pathos with which old Geoffrey\r\ndelighted the age of Cressy and of Poictiers.\r\n\r\nTo pursue this a little farther. If our neophyte, strong in the\r\nnew-born love of antiquity, were to undertake to imitate what he had\r\nlearnt to admire, it must be allowed he would act very injudiciously,\r\nif he were to select from the Glossary the obsolete words which it\r\ncontains, and employ those exclusively of all phrases and vocables\r\nretained in modern days. This was the error of the unfortunate\r\nChatterton. In order to give his language the appearance of antiquity,\r\nhe rejected every word that was modern, and produced a dialect entirely\r\ndifferent from any that had ever been spoken in Great Britain. He who\r\nwould imitate an ancient language with success, must attend rather to\r\nits grammatical character, turn of expression, and mode of arrangement,\r\nthan labour to collect extraordinary and antiquated terms, which, as I\r\nhave already averred, do not in ancient authors approach the number of\r\nwords still in use, though perhaps somewhat altered in sense and\r\nspelling, in the proportion of one to ten.\r\n\r\nWhat I have applied to language, is still more justly applicable to\r\nsentiments and manners. The passions, the sources from which these must\r\nspring in all their modifications, are generally the same in all ranks\r\nand conditions, all countries and ages; and it follows, as a matter of\r\ncourse, that the opinions, habits of thinking, and actions, however\r\ninfluenced by the peculiar state of society, must still, upon the\r\nwhole, bear a strong resemblance to each other. Our ancestors were not\r\nmore distinct from us, surely, than Jews are from Christians; they had\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceyes, hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions;\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the\r\nsame diseases, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nourselves. The tenor, therefore, of their affections and feelings, must\r\nhave borne the same general proportion to our own.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that of the materials which an author has to use\r\nin a romance, or fictitious composition, such as I have ventured to\r\nattempt, he will find that a great proportion, both of language and\r\nmanners, is as proper to the present time as to those in which he has\r\nlaid his time of action. The freedom of choice which this allows him,\r\nis therefore much greater, and the difficulty of his task much more\r\ndiminished, than at first appears. To take an illustration from a\r\nsister art, the antiquarian details may be said to represent the\r\npeculiar features of a landscape under delineation of the pencil. His\r\nfeudal tower must arise in due majesty; the figures which he introduces\r\nmust have the costume and character of their age; the piece must\r\nrepresent the peculiar features of the scene which he has chosen for\r\nhis subject, with all its appropriate elevation of rock, or precipitate\r\ndescent of cataract. His general colouring, too, must be copied from\r\nNature: The sky must be clouded or serene, according to the climate,\r\nand the general tints must be those which prevail in a natural\r\nlandscape. So far the painter is bound down by the rules of his art, to\r\na precise imitation of the features of Nature; but it is not required\r\nthat he should descend to copy all her more minute features, or\r\nrepresent with absolute exactness the very herbs, flowers, and trees,\r\nwith which the spot is decorated. These, as well as all the more minute\r\npoints of light and shadow, are attributes proper to scenery in\r\ngeneral, natural to each situation, and subject to the artist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisposal, as his taste or pleasure may dictate.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that this license is confined in either case within\r\nlegitimate bounds. The painter must introduce no ornament inconsistent\r\nwith the climate or country of his landscape; he must not plant cypress\r\ntrees upon Inch-Merrin, or Scottish firs among the ruins of Persepolis;\r\nand the author lies under a corresponding restraint. However far he may\r\nventure in a more full detail of passions and feelings, than is to be\r\nfound in the ancient compositions which he imitates, he must introduce\r\nnothing inconsistent with the manners of the age; his knights, squires,\r\ngrooms, and yeomen, may be more fully drawn than in the hard, dry\r\ndelineations of an ancient illuminated manuscript, but the character\r\nand costume of the age must remain inviolate; they must be the same\r\nfigures, drawn by a better pencil, or, to speak more modestly, executed\r\nin an age when the principles of art were better understood. His\r\nlanguage must not be exclusively obsolete and unintelligible; but he\r\nshould admit, if possible, no word or turn of phraseology betraying an\r\norigin directly modern. It is one thing to make use of the language and\r\nsentiments which are common to ourselves and our forefathers, and it is\r\nanother to invest them with the sentiments and dialect exclusively\r\nproper to their descendants.\r\n\r\nThis, my dear friend, I have found the most difficult part of my task;\r\nand, to speak frankly, I hardly expect to satisfy your less partial\r\njudgment, and more extensive knowledge of such subjects, since I have\r\nhardly been able to please my own.\r\n\r\nI am conscious that I shall be found still more faulty in the tone of\r\nkeeping and costume, by those who may be disposed rigidly to examine my\r\nTale, with reference to the manners of the exact period in which my\r\nactors flourished: It may be, that I have introduced little which can\r\npositively be termed modern; but, on the other hand, it is extremely\r\nprobable that I may have confused the manners of two or three\r\ncenturies, and introduced, during the reign of Richard the First,\r\ncircumstances appropriated to a period either considerably earlier, or\r\na good deal later than that era. It is my comfort, that errors of this\r\nkind will escape the general class of readers, and that I may share in\r\nthe ill-deserved applause of those architects, who, in their modern\r\nGothic, do not hesitate to introduce, without rule or method, ornaments\r\nproper to different styles and to different periods of the art. Those\r\nwhose extensive researches have given them the means of judging my\r\nbackslidings with more severity, will probably be lenient in proportion\r\nto their knowledge of the difficulty of my task. My honest and\r\nneglected friend, Ingulphus, has furnished me with many a valuable\r\nhint; but the light afforded by the Monk of Croydon, and Geoffrey de\r\nVinsauff, is dimmed by such a conglomeration of uninteresting and\r\nunintelligible matter, that we gladly fly for relief to the delightful\r\npages of the gallant Froissart, although he flourished at a period so\r\nmuch more remote from the date of my history. If, therefore, my dear\r\nfriend, you have generosity enough to pardon the presumptuous attempt,\r\nto frame for myself a minstrel coronet, partly out of the pearls of\r\npure antiquity, and partly from the Bristol stones and paste, with\r\nwhich I have endeavoured to imitate them, I am convinced your opinion\r\nof the difficulty of the task will reconcile you to the imperfect\r\nmanner of its execution.\r\n\r\nOf my materials I have but little to say. They may be chiefly found in\r\nthe singular Anglo-Norman MS., which Sir Arthur Wardour preserves with\r\nsuch jealous care in the third drawer of his oaken cabinet, scarcely\r\nallowing any one to touch it, and being himself not able to read one\r\nsyllable of its contents. I should never have got his consent, on my\r\nvisit to Scotland, to read in those precious pages for so many hours,\r\nhad I not promised to designate it by some emphatic mode of printing,\r\nas {The Wardour Manuscript}; giving it, thereby, an individuality as\r\nimportant as the Bannatyne MS., the Auchinleck MS., and any other\r\nmonument of the patience of a Gothic scrivener. I have sent, for your\r\nprivate consideration, a list of the contents of this curious piece,\r\nwhich I shall perhaps subjoin, with your approbation, to the third\r\nvolume of my Tale, in case the printer\xe2\x80\x99s devil should continue\r\nimpatient for copy, when the whole of my narrative has been imposed.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear friend; I have said enough to explain, if not to\r\nvindicate, the attempt which I have made, and which, in spite of your\r\ndoubts, and my own incapacity, I am still willing to believe has not\r\nbeen altogether made in vain.\r\n\r\nI hope you are now well recovered from your spring fit of the gout, and\r\nshall be happy if the advice of your learned physician should recommend\r\na tour to these parts. Several curiosities have been lately dug up near\r\nthe wall, as well as at the ancient station of Habitancum. Talking of\r\nthe latter, I suppose you have long since heard the news, that a sulky\r\nchurlish boor has destroyed the ancient statue, or rather bas-relief,\r\npopularly called Robin of Redesdale. It seems Robin\xe2\x80\x99s fame attracted\r\nmore visitants than was consistent with the growth of the heather, upon\r\na moor worth a shilling an acre. Reverend as you write yourself, be\r\nrevengeful for once, and pray with me that he may be visited with such\r\na fit of the stone, as if he had all the fragments of poor Robin in\r\nthat region of his viscera where the disease holds its seat. Tell this\r\nnot in Gath, lest the Scots rejoice that they have at length found a\r\nparallel instance among their neighbours, to that barbarous deed which\r\ndemolished Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s Oven. But there is no end to lamentation, when we\r\nbetake ourselves to such subjects. My respectful compliments attend\r\nMiss Dryasdust; I endeavoured to match the spectacles agreeable to her\r\ncommission, during my late journey to London, and hope she has received\r\nthem safe, and found them satisfactory. I send this by the blind\r\ncarrier, so that probably it may be some time upon its journey. 6\r\n\r\nThe last news which I hear from Edinburgh is, that the gentleman who\r\nfills the situation of Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries of\r\nScotland, 7 is the best amateur draftsman in that kingdom, and that\r\nmuch is expected from his skill and zeal in delineating those specimens\r\nof national antiquity, which are either mouldering under the slow touch\r\nof time, or swept away by modern taste, with the same besom of\r\ndestruction which John Knox used at the Reformation. Once more adieu;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cvale tandem, non immemor mei\xe2\x80\x9d. Believe me to be,\r\n\r\nReverend, and very dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour most faithful humble Servant.\r\n\r\nLaurence Templeton.\r\n\r\nToppingwold, near Egremont, Cumberland, Nov. 17, 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVANHOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThus communed these; while to their lowly dome,\r\nThe full-fed swine return\xe2\x80\x99d with evening home;\r\nCompell\xe2\x80\x99d, reluctant, to the several sties,\r\nWith din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPE\xe2\x80\x99S ODYSSEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that pleasant district of merry England which is watered by the\r\nriver Don, there extended in ancient times a large forest, covering the\r\ngreater part of the beautiful hills and valleys which lie between\r\nSheffield and the pleasant town of Doncaster. The remains of this\r\nextensive wood are still to be seen at the noble seats of Wentworth, of\r\nWarncliffe Park, and around Rotherham. Here haunted of yore the\r\nfabulous Dragon of Wantley; here were fought many of the most desperate\r\nbattles during the Civil Wars of the Roses; and here also flourished in\r\nancient times those bands of gallant outlaws, whose deeds have been\r\nrendered so popular in English song.\r\n\r\nSuch being our chief scene, the date of our story refers to a period\r\ntowards the end of the reign of Richard I., when his return from his\r\nlong captivity had become an event rather wished than hoped for by his\r\ndespairing subjects, who were in the meantime subjected to every\r\nspecies of subordinate oppression. The nobles, whose power had become\r\nexorbitant during the reign of Stephen, and whom the prudence of Henry\r\nthe Second had scarce reduced to some degree of subjection to the\r\ncrown, had now resumed their ancient license in its utmost extent;\r\ndespising the feeble interference of the English Council of State,\r\nfortifying their castles, increasing the number of their dependants,\r\nreducing all around them to a state of vassalage, and striving by every\r\nmeans in their power, to place themselves each at the head of such\r\nforces as might enable him to make a figure in the national convulsions\r\nwhich appeared to be impending.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the inferior gentry, or Franklins, as they were\r\ncalled, who, by the law and spirit of the English constitution, were\r\nentitled to hold themselves independent of feudal tyranny, became now\r\nunusually precarious. If, as was most generally the case, they placed\r\nthemselves under the protection of any of the petty kings in their\r\nvicinity, accepted of feudal offices in his household, or bound\r\nthemselves by mutual treaties of alliance and protection, to support\r\nhim in his enterprises, they might indeed purchase temporary repose;\r\nbut it must be with the sacrifice of that independence which was so\r\ndear to every English bosom, and at the certain hazard of being\r\ninvolved as a party in whatever rash expedition the ambition of their\r\nprotector might lead him to undertake. On the other hand, such and so\r\nmultiplied were the means of vexation and oppression possessed by the\r\ngreat Barons, that they never wanted the pretext, and seldom the will,\r\nto harass and pursue, even to the very edge of destruction, any of\r\ntheir less powerful neighbours, who attempted to separate themselves\r\nfrom their authority, and to trust for their protection, during the\r\ndangers of the times, to their own inoffensive conduct, and to the laws\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which greatly tended to enhance the tyranny of the\r\nnobility, and the sufferings of the inferior classes, arose from the\r\nconsequences of the Conquest by Duke William of Normandy. Four\r\ngenerations had not sufficed to blend the hostile blood of the Normans\r\nand Anglo-Saxons, or to unite, by common language and mutual interests,\r\ntwo hostile races, one of which still felt the elation of triumph,\r\nwhile the other groaned under all the consequences of defeat. The power\r\nhad been completely placed in the hands of the Norman nobility, by the\r\nevent of the battle of Hastings, and it had been used, as our histories\r\nassure us, with no moderate hand. The whole race of Saxon princes and\r\nnobles had been extirpated or disinherited, with few or no exceptions;\r\nnor were the numbers great who possessed land in the country of their\r\nfathers, even as proprietors of the second, or of yet inferior classes.\r\nThe royal policy had long been to weaken, by every means, legal or\r\nillegal, the strength of a part of the population which was justly\r\nconsidered as nourishing the most inveterate antipathy to their victor.\r\nAll the monarchs of the Norman race had shown the most marked\r\npredilection for their Norman subjects; the laws of the chase, and many\r\nothers equally unknown to the milder and more free spirit of the Saxon\r\nconstitution, had been fixed upon the necks of the subjugated\r\ninhabitants, to add weight, as it were, to the feudal chains with which\r\nthey were loaded. At court, and in the castles of the great nobles,\r\nwhere the pomp and state of a court was emulated, Norman-French was the\r\nonly language employed; in courts of law, the pleadings and judgments\r\nwere delivered in the same tongue. In short, French was the language of\r\nhonour, of chivalry, and even of justice, while the far more manly and\r\nexpressive Anglo-Saxon was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds,\r\nwho knew no other. Still, however, the necessary intercourse between\r\nthe lords of the soil, and those oppressed inferior beings by whom that\r\nsoil was cultivated, occasioned the gradual formation of a dialect,\r\ncompounded betwixt the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they could\r\nrender themselves mutually intelligible to each other; and from this\r\nnecessity arose by degrees the structure of our present English\r\nlanguage, in which the speech of the victors and the vanquished have\r\nbeen so happily blended together; and which has since been so richly\r\nimproved by importations from the classical languages, and from those\r\nspoken by the southern nations of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis state of things I have thought it necessary to premise for the\r\ninformation of the general reader, who might be apt to forget, that,\r\nalthough no great historical events, such as war or insurrection, mark\r\nthe existence of the Anglo-Saxons as a separate people subsequent to\r\nthe reign of William the Second; yet the great national distinctions\r\nbetwixt them and their conquerors, the recollection of what they had\r\nformerly been, and to what they were now reduced, continued down to the\r\nreign of Edward the Third, to keep open the wounds which the Conquest\r\nhad inflicted, and to maintain a line of separation betwixt the\r\ndescendants of the victor Normans and the vanquished Saxons.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting upon one of the rich grassy glades of that forest,\r\nwhich we have mentioned in the beginning of the chapter. Hundreds of\r\nbroad-headed, short-stemmed, wide-branched oaks, which had witnessed\r\nperhaps the stately march of the Roman soldiery, flung their gnarled\r\narms over a thick carpet of the most delicious green sward; in some\r\nplaces they were intermingled with beeches, hollies, and copsewood of\r\nvarious descriptions, so closely as totally to intercept the level\r\nbeams of the sinking sun; in others they receded from each other,\r\nforming those long sweeping vistas, in the intricacy of which the eye\r\ndelights to lose itself, while imagination considers them as the paths\r\nto yet wilder scenes of silvan solitude. Here the red rays of the sun\r\nshot a broken and discoloured light, that partially hung upon the\r\nshattered boughs and mossy trunks of the trees, and there they\r\nilluminated in brilliant patches the portions of turf to which they\r\nmade their way. A considerable open space, in the midst of this glade,\r\nseemed formerly to have been dedicated to the rites of Druidical\r\nsuperstition; for, on the summit of a hillock, so regular as to seem\r\nartificial, there still remained part of a circle of rough unhewn\r\nstones, of large dimensions. Seven stood upright; the rest had been\r\ndislodged from their places, probably by the zeal of some convert to\r\nChristianity, and lay, some prostrate near their former site, and\r\nothers on the side of the hill. One large stone only had found its way\r\nto the bottom, and in stopping the course of a small brook, which\r\nglided smoothly round the foot of the eminence, gave, by its\r\nopposition, a feeble voice of murmur to the placid and elsewhere silent\r\nstreamlet.\r\n\r\nThe human figures which completed this landscape, were in number two,\r\npartaking, in their dress and appearance, of that wild and rustic\r\ncharacter, which belonged to the woodlands of the West-Riding of\r\nYorkshire at that early period. The eldest of these men had a stern,\r\nsavage, and wild aspect. His garment was of the simplest form\r\nimaginable, being a close jacket with sleeves, composed of the tanned\r\nskin of some animal, on which the hair had been originally left, but\r\nwhich had been worn off in so many places, that it would have been\r\ndifficult to distinguish from the patches that remained, to what\r\ncreature the fur had belonged. This primeval vestment reached from the\r\nthroat to the knees, and served at once all the usual purposes of\r\nbody-clothing; there was no wider opening at the collar, than was\r\nnecessary to admit the passage of the head, from which it may be\r\ninferred, that it was put on by slipping it over the head and\r\nshoulders, in the manner of a modern shirt, or ancient hauberk.\r\nSandals, bound with thongs made of boars\xe2\x80\x99 hide, protected the feet, and\r\na roll of thin leather was twined artificially round the legs, and,\r\nascending above the calf, left the knees bare, like those of a Scottish\r\nHighlander. To make the jacket sit yet more close to the body, it was\r\ngathered at the middle by a broad leathern belt, secured by a brass\r\nbuckle; to one side of which was attached a sort of scrip, and to the\r\nother a ram\xe2\x80\x99s horn, accoutred with a mouthpiece, for the purpose of\r\nblowing. In the same belt was stuck one of those long, broad,\r\nsharp-pointed, and two-edged knives, with a buck\xe2\x80\x99s-horn handle, which\r\nwere fabricated in the neighbourhood, and bore even at this early\r\nperiod the name of a Sheffield whittle. The man had no covering upon\r\nhis head, which was only defended by his own thick hair, matted and\r\ntwisted together, and scorched by the influence of the sun into a rusty\r\ndark-red colour, forming a contrast with the overgrown beard upon his\r\ncheeks, which was rather of a yellow or amber hue. One part of his\r\ndress only remains, but it is too remarkable to be suppressed; it was a\r\nbrass ring, resembling a dog\xe2\x80\x99s collar, but without any opening, and\r\nsoldered fast round his neck, so loose as to form no impediment to his\r\nbreathing, yet so tight as to be incapable of being removed, excepting\r\nby the use of the file. On this singular gorget was engraved, in Saxon\r\ncharacters, an inscription of the following purport:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGurth, the son of\r\nBeowulph, is the born thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeside the swine-herd, for such was Gurth\xe2\x80\x99s occupation, was seated,\r\nupon one of the fallen Druidical monuments, a person about ten years\r\nyounger in appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his\r\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s in form, was of better materials, and of a more fantastic\r\nappearance. His jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue, upon\r\nwhich there had been some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in\r\ndifferent colours. To the jacket he added a short cloak, which scarcely\r\nreached half way down his thigh; it was of crimson cloth, though a good\r\ndeal soiled, lined with bright yellow; and as he could transfer it from\r\none shoulder to the other, or at his pleasure draw it all around him,\r\nits width, contrasted with its want of longitude, formed a fantastic\r\npiece of drapery. He had thin silver bracelets upon his arms, and on\r\nhis neck a collar of the same metal bearing the inscription, \xe2\x80\x9cWamba,\r\nthe son of Witless, is the thrall of Cedric of Rotherwood.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\npersonage had the same sort of sandals with his companion, but instead\r\nof the roll of leather thong, his legs were cased in a sort of gaiters,\r\nof which one was red and the other yellow. He was provided also with a\r\ncap, having around it more than one bell, about the size of those\r\nattached to hawks, which jingled as he turned his head to one side or\r\nother; and as he seldom remained a minute in the same posture, the\r\nsound might be considered as incessant. Around the edge of this cap was\r\na stiff bandeau of leather, cut at the top into open work, resembling a\r\ncoronet, while a prolonged bag arose from within it, and fell down on\r\none shoulder like an old-fashioned nightcap, or a jelly-bag, or the\r\nhead-gear of a modern hussar. It was to this part of the cap that the\r\nbells were attached; which circumstance, as well as the shape of his\r\nhead-dress, and his own half-crazed, half-cunning expression of\r\ncountenance, sufficiently pointed him out as belonging to the race of\r\ndomestic clowns or jesters, maintained in the houses of the wealthy, to\r\nhelp away the tedium of those lingering hours which they were obliged\r\nto spend within doors. He bore, like his companion, a scrip, attached\r\nto his belt, but had neither horn nor knife, being probably considered\r\nas belonging to a class whom it is esteemed dangerous to intrust with\r\nedge-tools. In place of these, he was equipped with a sword of lath,\r\nresembling that with which Harlequin operates his wonders upon the\r\nmodern stage.\r\n\r\nThe outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger\r\ncontrast than their look and demeanour. That of the serf, or bondsman,\r\nwas sad and sullen; his aspect was bent on the ground with an\r\nappearance of deep dejection, which might be almost construed into\r\napathy, had not the fire which occasionally sparkled in his red eye\r\nmanifested that there slumbered, under the appearance of sullen\r\ndespondency, a sense of oppression, and a disposition to resistance.\r\nThe looks of Wamba, on the other hand, indicated, as usual with his\r\nclass, a sort of vacant curiosity, and fidgetty impatience of any\r\nposture of repose, together with the utmost self-satisfaction\r\nrespecting his own situation, and the appearance which he made. The\r\ndialogue which they maintained between them, was carried on in\r\nAnglo-Saxon, which, as we said before, was universally spoken by the\r\ninferior classes, excepting the Norman soldiers, and the immediate\r\npersonal dependants of the great feudal nobles. But to give their\r\nconversation in the original would convey but little information to the\r\nmodern reader, for whose benefit we beg to offer the following\r\ntranslation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of St Withold upon these infernal porkers!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nswine-herd, after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collect together\r\nthe scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes\r\nequally melodious, made, however, no haste to remove themselves from\r\nthe luxurious banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had\r\nfattened, or to forsake the marshy banks of the rivulet, where several\r\nof them, half plunged in mud, lay stretched at their ease, altogether\r\nregardless of the voice of their keeper. \xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of St Withold upon\r\nthem and upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cif the two-legged wolf snap not up some\r\nof them ere nightfall, I am no true man. Here, Fangs! Fangs!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nejaculated at the top of his voice to a ragged wolfish-looking dog, a\r\nsort of lurcher, half mastiff, half greyhound, which ran limping about\r\nas if with the purpose of seconding his master in collecting the\r\nrefractory grunters; but which, in fact, from misapprehension of the\r\nswine-herd\xe2\x80\x99s signals, ignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense,\r\nonly drove them hither and thither, and increased the evil which he\r\nseemed to design to remedy. \xe2\x80\x9cA devil draw the teeth of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGurth, \xe2\x80\x9cand the mother of mischief confound the Ranger of the forest,\r\nthat cuts the foreclaws off our dogs, and makes them unfit for their\r\ntrade! 8 Wamba, up and help me an thou be\xe2\x80\x99st a man; take a turn round\r\nthe back o\xe2\x80\x99 the hill to gain the wind on them; and when thous\xe2\x80\x99t got the\r\nweather-gage, thou mayst drive them before thee as gently as so many\r\ninnocent lambs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, without stirring from the spot, \xe2\x80\x9cI have consulted\r\nmy legs upon this matter, and they are altogether of opinion, that to\r\ncarry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of\r\nunfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore,\r\nGurth, I advise thee to call off Fangs, and leave the herd to their\r\ndestiny, which, whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers, or\r\nof outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to be\r\nconverted into Normans before morning, to thy no small ease and\r\ncomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe swine turned Normans to my comfort!\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cexpound that to\r\nme, Wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too vexed, to read\r\nriddles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four\r\nlegs?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Wamba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwine, fool, swine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the herd, \xe2\x80\x9cevery fool knows that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd swine is good Saxon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how call you the sow\r\nwhen she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels,\r\nlike a traitor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPork,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the swine-herd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad every fool knows that too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cand pork, I\r\nthink, is good Norman-French; and so when the brute lives, and is in\r\nthe charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes a\r\nNorman, and is called pork, when she is carried to the Castle-hall to\r\nfeast among the nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend Gurth,\r\nha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is but too true doctrine, friend Wamba, however it got into thy\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x99s pate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, I can tell you more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, in the same tone; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is old\r\nAlderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon epithet, while he is under the\r\ncharge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes Beef, a fiery\r\nFrench gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are\r\ndestined to consume him. Mynheer Calf, too, becomes Monsieur de Veau in\r\nthe like manner; he is Saxon when he requires tendance, and takes a\r\nNorman name when he becomes matter of enjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cthou speakest but sad truths; little\r\nis left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to have been\r\nreserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to\r\nendure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. The finest and the\r\nfattest is for their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best\r\nand bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten\r\ndistant lands with their bones, leaving few here who have either will\r\nor the power to protect the unfortunate Saxon. God\xe2\x80\x99s blessing on our\r\nmaster Cedric, he hath done the work of a man in standing in the gap;\r\nbut Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf is coming down to this country in person,\r\nand we shall soon see how little Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s trouble will avail him.\xe2\x80\x94Here,\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed again, raising his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cSo ho! so ho! well done,\r\nFangs! thou hast them all before thee now, and bring\xe2\x80\x99st them on\r\nbravely, lad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGurth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cI know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou\r\nwouldst not be so rash in putting thy head into my mouth. One word to\r\nReginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, or Philip de Malvoisin, that thou hast spoken\r\ntreason against the Norman,\xe2\x80\x94and thou art but a cast-away\r\nswineherd,\xe2\x80\x94thou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all\r\nevil speakers against dignities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDog, thou wouldst not betray me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cafter having led me on\r\nto speak so much at disadvantage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetray thee!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9cno, that were the trick of a wise\r\nman; a fool cannot half so well help himself\xe2\x80\x94but soft, whom have we\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, listening to the trampling of several horses which\r\nbecame then audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind whom,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, who had now got his herd before him,\r\nand, with the aid of Fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim\r\nvistas which we have endeavoured to describe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but I must see the riders,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps they are\r\ncome from Fairy-land with a message from King Oberon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA murrain take thee,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the swine-herd; \xe2\x80\x9cwilt thou talk of such\r\nthings, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging\r\nwithin a few miles of us? Hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer\r\nrain, I never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the\r\nclouds; the oaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak\r\nwith their great boughs as if announcing a tempest. Thou canst play the\r\nrational if thou wilt; credit me for once, and let us home ere the\r\nstorm begins to rage, for the night will be fearful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his\r\ncompanion, who began his journey after catching up a long quarter-staff\r\nwhich lay upon the grass beside him. This second Eumaeus strode hastily\r\ndown the forest glade, driving before him, with the assistance of\r\nFangs, the whole herd of his inharmonious charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nA Monk there was, a fayre for the maistrie,\r\nAn outrider that loved venerie;\r\nA manly man, to be an Abbot able,\r\nFull many a daintie horse had he in stable:\r\nAnd whan he rode, men might his bridle hear\r\nGingeling in a whistling wind as clear,\r\nAnd eke as loud, as doth the chapell bell,\r\nThere as this lord was keeper of the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUCER\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his\r\ncompanion, the noise of the horsemen\xe2\x80\x99s feet continuing to approach,\r\nWamba could not be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road,\r\nupon every pretence which occurred; now catching from the hazel a\r\ncluster of half-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a\r\ncottage maiden who crossed their path. The horsemen, therefore, soon\r\novertook them on the road.\r\n\r\nTheir numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost\r\nseemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others their\r\nattendants. It was not difficult to ascertain the condition and\r\ncharacter of one of these personages. He was obviously an ecclesiastic\r\nof high rank; his dress was that of a Cistercian Monk, but composed of\r\nmaterials much finer than those which the rule of that order admitted.\r\nHis mantle and hood were of the best Flanders cloth, and fell in ample,\r\nand not ungraceful folds, around a handsome, though somewhat corpulent\r\nperson. His countenance bore as little the marks of self-denial, as his\r\nhabit indicated contempt of worldly splendour. His features might have\r\nbeen called good, had there not lurked under the pent-house of his eye,\r\nthat sly epicurean twinkle which indicates the cautious voluptuary. In\r\nother respects, his profession and situation had taught him a ready\r\ncommand over his countenance, which he could contract at pleasure into\r\nsolemnity, although its natural expression was that of good-humoured\r\nsocial indulgence. In defiance of conventual rules, and the edicts of\r\npopes and councils, the sleeves of this dignitary were lined and turned\r\nup with rich furs, his mantle secured at the throat with a golden\r\nclasp, and the whole dress proper to his order as much refined upon and\r\nornamented, as that of a quaker beauty of the present day, who, while\r\nshe retains the garb and costume of her sect continues to give to its\r\nsimplicity, by the choice of materials and the mode of disposing them,\r\na certain air of coquettish attraction, savouring but too much of the\r\nvanities of the world.\r\n\r\nThis worthy churchman rode upon a well-fed ambling mule, whose\r\nfurniture was highly decorated, and whose bridle, according to the\r\nfashion of the day, was ornamented with silver bells. In his seat he\r\nhad nothing of the awkwardness of the convent, but displayed the easy\r\nand habitual grace of a well-trained horseman. Indeed, it seemed that\r\nso humble a conveyance as a mule, in however good case, and however\r\nwell broken to a pleasant and accommodating amble, was only used by the\r\ngallant monk for travelling on the road. A lay brother, one of those\r\nwho followed in the train, had, for his use on other occasions, one of\r\nthe most handsome Spanish jennets ever bred at Andalusia, which\r\nmerchants used at that time to import, with great trouble and risk, for\r\nthe use of persons of wealth and distinction. The saddle and housings\r\nof this superb palfrey were covered by a long foot-cloth, which reached\r\nnearly to the ground, and on which were richly embroidered, mitres,\r\ncrosses, and other ecclesiastical emblems. Another lay brother led a\r\nsumpter mule, loaded probably with his superior\xe2\x80\x99s baggage; and two\r\nmonks of his own order, of inferior station, rode together in the rear,\r\nlaughing and conversing with each other, without taking much notice of\r\nthe other members of the cavalcade.\r\n\r\nThe companion of the church dignitary was a man past forty, thin,\r\nstrong, tall, and muscular; an athletic figure, which long fatigue and\r\nconstant exercise seemed to have left none of the softer part of the\r\nhuman form, having reduced the whole to brawn, bones, and sinews, which\r\nhad sustained a thousand toils, and were ready to dare a thousand more.\r\nHis head was covered with a scarlet cap, faced with fur\xe2\x80\x94of that kind\r\nwhich the French call \xe2\x80\x9cmortier\xe2\x80\x9d, from its resemblance to the shape of\r\nan inverted mortar. His countenance was therefore fully displayed, and\r\nits expression was calculated to impress a degree of awe, if not of\r\nfear, upon strangers. High features, naturally strong and powerfully\r\nexpressive, had been burnt almost into Negro blackness by constant\r\nexposure to the tropical sun, and might, in their ordinary state, be\r\nsaid to slumber after the storm of passion had passed away; but the\r\nprojection of the veins of the forehead, the readiness with which the\r\nupper lip and its thick black moustaches quivered upon the slightest\r\nemotion, plainly intimated that the tempest might be again and easily\r\nawakened. His keen, piercing, dark eyes, told in every glance a history\r\nof difficulties subdued, and dangers dared, and seemed to challenge\r\nopposition to his wishes, for the pleasure of sweeping it from his road\r\nby a determined exertion of courage and of will; a deep scar on his\r\nbrow gave additional sternness to his countenance, and a sinister\r\nexpression to one of his eyes, which had been slightly injured on the\r\nsame occasion, and of which the vision, though perfect, was in a slight\r\nand partial degree distorted.\r\n\r\nThe upper dress of this personage resembled that of his companion in\r\nshape, being a long monastic mantle; but the colour, being scarlet,\r\nshowed that he did not belong to any of the four regular orders of\r\nmonks. On the right shoulder of the mantle there was cut, in white\r\ncloth, a cross of a peculiar form. This upper robe concealed what at\r\nfirst view seemed rather inconsistent with its form, a shirt, namely,\r\nof linked mail, with sleeves and gloves of the same, curiously plaited\r\nand interwoven, as flexible to the body as those which are now wrought\r\nin the stocking-loom, out of less obdurate materials. The fore-part of\r\nhis thighs, where the folds of his mantle permitted them to be seen,\r\nwere also covered with linked mail; the knees and feet were defended by\r\nsplints, or thin plates of steel, ingeniously jointed upon each other;\r\nand mail hose, reaching from the ankle to the knee, effectually\r\nprotected the legs, and completed the rider\xe2\x80\x99s defensive armour. In his\r\ngirdle he wore a long and double-edged dagger, which was the only\r\noffensive weapon about his person.\r\n\r\nHe rode, not a mule, like his companion, but a strong hackney for the\r\nroad, to save his gallant war-horse, which a squire led behind, fully\r\naccoutred for battle, with a chamfron or plaited head-piece upon his\r\nhead, having a short spike projecting from the front. On one side of\r\nthe saddle hung a short battle-axe, richly inlaid with Damascene\r\ncarving; on the other the rider\xe2\x80\x99s plumed head-piece and hood of mail,\r\nwith a long two-handed sword, used by the chivalry of the period. A\r\nsecond squire held aloft his master\xe2\x80\x99s lance, from the extremity of\r\nwhich fluttered a small banderole, or streamer, bearing a cross of the\r\nsame form with that embroidered upon his cloak. He also carried his\r\nsmall triangular shield, broad enough at the top to protect the breast,\r\nand from thence diminishing to a point. It was covered with a scarlet\r\ncloth, which prevented the device from being seen.\r\n\r\nThese two squires were followed by two attendants, whose dark visages,\r\nwhite turbans, and the Oriental form of their garments, showed them to\r\nbe natives of some distant Eastern country. 9\r\n\r\nThe whole appearance of this warrior and his retinue was wild and\r\noutlandish; the dress of his squires was gorgeous, and his Eastern\r\nattendants wore silver collars round their throats, and bracelets of\r\nthe same metal upon their swarthy arms and legs, of which the former\r\nwere naked from the elbow, and the latter from mid-leg to ankle. Silk\r\nand embroidery distinguished their dresses, and marked the wealth and\r\nimportance of their master; forming, at the same time, a striking\r\ncontrast with the martial simplicity of his own attire. They were armed\r\nwith crooked sabres, having the hilt and baldric inlaid with gold, and\r\nmatched with Turkish daggers of yet more costly workmanship. Each of\r\nthem bore at his saddle-bow a bundle of darts or javelins, about four\r\nfeet in length, having sharp steel heads, a weapon much in use among\r\nthe Saracens, and of which the memory is yet preserved in the martial\r\nexercise called \xe2\x80\x9cEl Jerrid\xe2\x80\x9d, still practised in the Eastern countries.\r\n\r\nThe steeds of these attendants were in appearance as foreign as their\r\nriders. They were of Saracen origin, and consequently of Arabian\r\ndescent; and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and\r\neasy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed,\r\nheavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in Flanders and in\r\nNormandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply\r\nof plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those Eastern\r\ncoursers, might have passed for a personification of substance and of\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nThe singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the\r\ncuriosity of Wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile\r\ncompanion. The monk he instantly knew to be the Prior of Jorvaulx\r\nAbbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of the\r\nbanquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures\r\nstill more inconsistent with his monastic vows.\r\n\r\nYet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the\r\nclergy, whether secular or regular, that the Prior Aymer maintained a\r\nfair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. His free and jovial\r\ntemper, and the readiness with which he granted absolution from all\r\nordinary delinquencies, rendered him a favourite among the nobility and\r\nprincipal gentry, to several of whom he was allied by birth, being of a\r\ndistinguished Norman family. The ladies, in particular, were not\r\ndisposed to scan too nicely the morals of a man who was a professed\r\nadmirer of their sex, and who possessed many means of dispelling the\r\nennui which was too apt to intrude upon the halls and bowers of an\r\nancient feudal castle. The Prior mingled in the sports of the field\r\nwith more than due eagerness, and was allowed to possess the\r\nbest-trained hawks, and the fleetest greyhounds in the North Riding;\r\ncircumstances which strongly recommended him to the youthful gentry.\r\nWith the old, he had another part to play, which, when needful, he\r\ncould sustain with great decorum. His knowledge of books, however\r\nsuperficial, was sufficient to impress upon their ignorance respect for\r\nhis supposed learning; and the gravity of his deportment and language,\r\nwith the high tone which he exerted in setting forth the authority of\r\nthe church and of the priesthood, impressed them no less with an\r\nopinion of his sanctity. Even the common people, the severest critics\r\nof the conduct of their betters, had commiseration with the follies of\r\nPrior Aymer. He was generous; and charity, as it is well known,\r\ncovereth a multitude of sins, in another sense than that in which it is\r\nsaid to do so in Scripture. The revenues of the monastery, of which a\r\nlarge part was at his disposal, while they gave him the means of\r\nsupplying his own very considerable expenses, afforded also those\r\nlargesses which he bestowed among the peasantry, and with which he\r\nfrequently relieved the distresses of the oppressed. If Prior Aymer\r\nrode hard in the chase, or remained long at the banquet,\xe2\x80\x94if Prior Aymer\r\nwas seen, at the early peep of dawn, to enter the postern of the abbey,\r\nas he glided home from some rendezvous which had occupied the hours of\r\ndarkness, men only shrugged up their shoulders, and reconciled\r\nthemselves to his irregularities, by recollecting that the same were\r\npractised by many of his brethren who had no redeeming qualities\r\nwhatsoever to atone for them. Prior Aymer, therefore, and his\r\ncharacter, were well known to our Saxon serfs, who made their rude\r\nobeisance, and received his \xe2\x80\x9cbenedicite, mes filz,\xe2\x80\x9d in return.\r\n\r\nBut the singular appearance of his companion and his attendants,\r\narrested their attention and excited their wonder, and they could\r\nscarcely attend to the Prior of Jorvaulx\xe2\x80\x99 question, when he demanded if\r\nthey knew of any place of harbourage in the vicinity; so much were they\r\nsurprised at the half monastic, half military appearance of the swarthy\r\nstranger, and at the uncouth dress and arms of his Eastern attendants.\r\nIt is probable, too, that the language in which the benediction was\r\nconferred, and the information asked, sounded ungracious, though not\r\nprobably unintelligible, in the ears of the Saxon peasants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you, my children,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, raising his voice, and\r\nusing the lingua Franca, or mixed language, in which the Norman and\r\nSaxon races conversed with each other, \xe2\x80\x9cif there be in this\r\nneighbourhood any good man, who, for the love of God, and devotion to\r\nMother Church, will give two of her humblest servants, with their\r\ntrain, a night\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality and refreshment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a\r\nstrong contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo of the humblest servants of Mother Church!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Wamba to\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x94but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation\r\naudible; \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and\r\nother principal domestics!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this internal commentary on the Prior\xe2\x80\x99s speech, he raised his\r\neyes, and replied to the question which had been put.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the reverend fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cloved good cheer and soft lodging,\r\nfew miles of riding would carry them to the Priory of Brinxworth, where\r\ntheir quality could not but secure them the most honourable reception;\r\nor if they preferred spending a penitential evening, they might turn\r\ndown yonder wild glade, which would bring them to the hermitage of\r\nCopmanhurst, where a pious anchoret would make them sharers for the\r\nnight of the shelter of his roof and the benefit of his prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prior shook his head at both proposals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine honest friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif the jangling of thy bells had not\r\ndizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know \xe2\x80\x9cClericus clericum non\r\ndecimat\xe2\x80\x9d; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus an\r\nopportunity to serve God in honouring and relieving his appointed\r\nservants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I, being but an ass, am,\r\nnevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmule; notwithstanding, I did conceive that the charity of Mother Church\r\nand her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA truce to thine insolence, fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the armed rider, breaking in\r\non his prattle with a high and stern voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell us, if thou\r\ncanst, the road to\xe2\x80\x94How call\xe2\x80\x99d you your Franklin, Prior Aymer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCedric,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9cCedric the Saxon.\xe2\x80\x94Tell me, good fellow,\r\nare we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe road will be uneasy to find,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, who broke silence\r\nfor the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cand the family of Cedric retire early to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush, tell not me, fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the military rider; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis easy for\r\nthem to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who\r\nwill not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to\r\ncommand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, sullenly, \xe2\x80\x9cif I should show the way to my\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most\r\nare fain to ask as a favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you dispute with me, slave!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier; and, setting spurs\r\nto his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising\r\nat the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a\r\npurpose of chastising what he considered as the insolence of the\r\npeasant.\r\n\r\nGurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,\r\nyet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the\r\ninterference of Prior Aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion\r\nand the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, by St Mary, brother Brian, you must not think you are now in\r\nPalestine, predominating over heathen Turks and infidel Saracens; we\r\nislanders love not blows, save those of holy Church, who chasteneth\r\nwhom she loveth.\xe2\x80\x94Tell me, good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Wamba, and seconded\r\nhis speech by a small piece of silver coin, \xe2\x80\x9cthe way to Cedric the\r\nSaxon\xe2\x80\x99s; you cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct\r\nthe wanderer even when his character is less sanctified than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn truth, venerable father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Saracen head of\r\nyour right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nam not sure I shall get there to-night myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbot, \xe2\x80\x9cthou canst tell us if thou wilt. This reverend\r\nbrother has been all his life engaged in fighting among the Saracens\r\nfor the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre; he is of the order of Knights\r\nTemplars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a\r\nsoldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is but half a monk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9che should not be wholly\r\nunreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they\r\nshould be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive thy wit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Abbot, \xe2\x80\x9con condition thou wilt show me\r\nthe way to Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s mansion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cyour reverences must hold on this path\r\ntill you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit\xe2\x80\x99s length\r\nremains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are\r\nfour which meet at Sunken Cross, and I trust your reverences will\r\nobtain shelter before the storm comes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to\r\ntheir horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the\r\nbursting of a night-storm. As their horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs died away, Gurth said\r\nto his companion, \xe2\x80\x9cIf they follow thy wise direction, the reverend\r\nfathers will hardly reach Rotherwood this night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, grinning, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they may reach Sheffield if they\r\nhave good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. I am not so bad a\r\nwoodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if I have no mind he\r\nshould chase him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cit were ill that Aymer saw the Lady\r\nRowena; and it were worse, it may be, for Cedric to quarrel, as is most\r\nlikely he would, with this military monk. But, like good servants let\r\nus hear and see, and say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe return to the riders, who had soon left the bondsmen far behind\r\nthem, and who maintained the following conversation in the\r\nNorman-French language, usually employed by the superior classes, with\r\nthe exception of the few who were still inclined to boast their Saxon\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mean these fellows by their capricious insolence?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nTemplar to the Benedictine, \xe2\x80\x9cand why did you prevent me from chastising\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, brother Brian,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9ctouching the one of them,\r\nit were hard for me to render a reason for a fool speaking according to\r\nhis folly; and the other churl is of that savage, fierce, intractable\r\nrace, some of whom, as I have often told you, are still to be found\r\namong the descendants of the conquered Saxons, and whose supreme\r\npleasure it is to testify, by all means in their power, their aversion\r\nto their conquerors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would soon have beat him into courtesy,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Brian; \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\naccustomed to deal with such spirits: Our Turkish captives are as\r\nfierce and intractable as Odin himself could have been; yet two months\r\nin my household, under the management of my master of the slaves, has\r\nmade them humble, submissive, serviceable, and observant of your will.\r\nMarry, sir, you must be aware of the poison and the dagger; for they\r\nuse either with free will when you give them the slightest\r\nopportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prior Aymer, \xe2\x80\x9cevery land has its own manners and\r\nfashions; and, besides that beating this fellow could procure us no\r\ninformation respecting the road to Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s house, it would have been\r\nsure to have established a quarrel betwixt you and him had we found our\r\nway thither. Remember what I told you: this wealthy franklin is proud,\r\nfierce, jealous, and irritable, a withstander of the nobility, and even\r\nof his neighbors, Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and Philip Malvoisin, who are\r\nno babies to strive with. He stands up sternly for the privileges of\r\nhis race, and is so proud of his uninterrupted descend from Hereward, a\r\nrenowned champion of the Heptarchy, that he is universally called\r\nCedric the Saxon; and makes a boast of his belonging to a people from\r\nwhom many others endeaver to hide their descent, lest they should\r\nencounter a share of the \xe2\x80\x98vae victis,\xe2\x80\x99 or severities imposed upon the\r\nvanquished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrior Aymer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a man of gallantry, learned\r\nin the study of beauty, and as expert as a troubadour in all matters\r\nconcerning the \xe2\x80\x98arrets\xe2\x80\x99 of love; but I shall expect much beauty in this\r\ncelebrated Rowena to counterbalance the self-denial and forbearance\r\nwhich I must exert if I am to court the favor of such a seditious churl\r\nas you have described her father Cedric.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCedric is not her father,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cand is but of remote\r\nrelation: she is descended from higher blood than even he pretends to,\r\nand is but distantly connected with him by birth. Her guardian,\r\nhowever, he is, self-constituted as I believe; but his ward is as dear\r\nto him as if she were his own child. Of her beauty you shall soon be\r\njudge; and if the purity of her complexion, and the majestic, yet soft\r\nexpression of a mild blue eye, do not chase from your memory the\r\nblack-tressed girls of Palestine, ay, or the houris of old Mahound\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparadise, I am an infidel, and no true son of the church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould your boasted beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cbe weighed in the\r\nbalance and found wanting, you know our wager?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gold collar,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst ten butts of Chian\r\nwine;\xe2\x80\x94they are mine as securely as if they were already in the convent\r\nvaults, under the key of old Dennis the cellarer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am myself to be judge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cand am only to be\r\nconvicted on my own admission, that I have seen no maiden so beautiful\r\nsince Pentecost was a twelvemonth. Ran it not so?\xe2\x80\x94Prior, your collar is\r\nin danger; I will wear it over my gorget in the lists of\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWin it fairly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cand wear it as ye will; I will trust\r\nyour giving true response, on your word as a knight and as a churchman.\r\nYet, brother, take my advice, and file your tongue to a little more\r\ncourtesy than your habits of predominating over infidel captives and\r\nEastern bondsmen have accustomed you. Cedric the Saxon, if\r\noffended,\xe2\x80\x94and he is noway slack in taking offence,\xe2\x80\x94is a man who,\r\nwithout respect to your knighthood, my high office, or the sanctity of\r\neither, would clear his house of us, and send us to lodge with the\r\nlarks, though the hour were midnight. And be careful how you look on\r\nRowena, whom he cherishes with the most jealous care; an he take the\r\nleast alarm in that quarter we are but lost men. It is said he banished\r\nhis only son from his family for lifting his eyes in the way of\r\naffection towards this beauty, who may be worshipped, it seems, at a\r\ndistance, but is not to be approached with other thoughts than such as\r\nwe bring to the shrine of the Blessed Virgin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have said enough,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cI will for a night\r\nput on the needful restraint, and deport me as meekly as a maiden; but\r\nas for the fear of his expelling us by violence, myself and squires,\r\nwith Hamet and Abdalla, will warrant you against that disgrace. Doubt\r\nnot that we shall be strong enough to make good our quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must not let it come so far,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9cbut here is the\r\nclown\xe2\x80\x99s sunken cross, and the night is so dark that we can hardly see\r\nwhich of the roads we are to follow. He bid us turn, I think to the\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian, \xe2\x80\x9cto the best of my remembrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the left, certainly, the left; I remember his pointing with his\r\nwooden sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his\r\nbody with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar.\r\n\r\nEach maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in\r\nall such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been\r\nnear enough to hear Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s directions. At length Brian remarked, what\r\nhad at first escaped him in the twilight; \xe2\x80\x9cHere is some one either\r\nasleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross\xe2\x80\x94Hugo, stir him with the\r\nbutt-end of thy lance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good\r\nFrench, \xe2\x80\x9cWhosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my\r\nthoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did but wish to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cthe road to Rotherwood,\r\nthe abode of Cedric the Saxon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI myself am bound thither,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I had a\r\nhorse, I would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though\r\nperfectly well known to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif thou wilt bring us to Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s in safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and\r\ngive that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to\r\nserve for a guide.\r\n\r\nTheir conductor pursued an opposite road from that which Wamba had\r\nrecommended, for the purpose of misleading them. The path soon led\r\ndeeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach\r\nto which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed;\r\nbut the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground\r\nand the safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention,\r\nbrought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet\r\nseen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper\r\nextremity, he said to the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cYonder is Rotherwood, the dwelling of\r\nCedric the Saxon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a joyful intimation to Aymer, whose nerves were none of the\r\nstrongest, and who had suffered such agitation and alarm in the course\r\nof passing through the dangerous bogs, that he had not yet had the\r\ncuriosity to ask his guide a single question. Finding himself now at\r\nhis ease and near shelter, his curiosity began to awake, and he\r\ndemanded of the guide who and what he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Palmer, just returned from the Holy Land,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better have tarried there to fight for the recovery of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Reverend Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Palmer, to whom the\r\nappearance of the Templar seemed perfectly familiar; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when those\r\nwho are under oath to recover the holy city, are found travelling at\r\nsuch a distance from the scene of their duties, can you wonder that a\r\npeaceful peasant like me should decline the task which they have\r\nabandoned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Templar would have made an angry reply, but was interrupted by the\r\nPrior, who again expressed his astonishment, that their guide, after\r\nsuch long absence, should be so perfectly acquainted with the passes of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was born a native of these parts,\xe2\x80\x9d answered their guide, and as he\r\nmade the reply they stood before the mansion of Cedric;\xe2\x80\x94a low irregular\r\nbuilding, containing several court-yards or enclosures, extending over\r\na considerable space of ground, and which, though its size argued the\r\ninhabitant to be a person of wealth, differed entirely from the tall,\r\nturretted, and castellated buildings in which the Norman nobility\r\nresided, and which had become the universal style of architecture\r\nthroughout England.\r\n\r\nRotherwood was not, however, without defences; no habitation, in that\r\ndisturbed period, could have been so, without the risk of being\r\nplundered and burnt before the next morning. A deep fosse, or ditch,\r\nwas drawn round the whole building, and filled with water from a\r\nneighbouring stream. A double stockade, or palisade, composed of\r\npointed beams, which the adjacent forest supplied, defended the outer\r\nand inner bank of the trench. There was an entrance from the west\r\nthrough the outer stockade, which communicated by a drawbridge, with a\r\nsimilar opening in the interior defences. Some precautions had been\r\ntaken to place those entrances under the protection of projecting\r\nangles, by which they might be flanked in case of need by archers or\r\nslingers.\r\n\r\nBefore this entrance the Templar wound his horn loudly; for the rain,\r\nwhich had long threatened, began now to descend with great violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThen (sad relief!) from the bleak coast that hears\r\nThe German Ocean roar, deep-blooming, strong,\r\nAnd yellow hair\xe2\x80\x99d, the blue-eyed Saxon came.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMSON\xe2\x80\x99S LIBERTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a hall, the height of which was greatly disproportioned to its\r\nextreme length and width, a long oaken table, formed of planks\r\nrough-hewn from the forest, and which had scarcely received any polish,\r\nstood ready prepared for the evening meal of Cedric the Saxon. The\r\nroof, composed of beams and rafters, had nothing to divide the\r\napartment from the sky excepting the planking and thatch; there was a\r\nhuge fireplace at either end of the hall, but as the chimneys were\r\nconstructed in a very clumsy manner, at least as much of the smoke\r\nfound its way into the apartment as escaped by the proper vent. The\r\nconstant vapour which this occasioned, had polished the rafters and\r\nbeams of the low-browed hall, by encrusting them with a black varnish\r\nof soot. On the sides of the apartment hung implements of war and of\r\nthe chase, and there were at each corner folding doors, which gave\r\naccess to other parts of the extensive building.\r\n\r\nThe other appointments of the mansion partook of the rude simplicity of\r\nthe Saxon period, which Cedric piqued himself upon maintaining. The\r\nfloor was composed of earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard\r\nsubstance, such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns. For\r\nabout one quarter of the length of the apartment, the floor was raised\r\nby a step, and this space, which was called the dais, was occupied only\r\nby the principal members of the family, and visitors of distinction.\r\nFor this purpose, a table richly covered with scarlet cloth was placed\r\ntransversely across the platform, from the middle of which ran the\r\nlonger and lower board, at which the domestics and inferior persons\r\nfed, down towards the bottom of the hall. The whole resembled the form\r\nof the letter T, or some of those ancient dinner-tables, which,\r\narranged on the same principles, may be still seen in the antique\r\nColleges of Oxford or Cambridge. Massive chairs and settles of carved\r\noak were placed upon the dais, and over these seats and the more\r\nelevated table was fastened a canopy of cloth, which served in some\r\ndegree to protect the dignitaries who occupied that distinguished\r\nstation from the weather, and especially from the rain, which in some\r\nplaces found its way through the ill-constructed roof.\r\n\r\nThe walls of this upper end of the hall, as far as the dais extended,\r\nwere covered with hangings or curtains, and upon the floor there was a\r\ncarpet, both of which were adorned with some attempts at tapestry, or\r\nembroidery, executed with brilliant or rather gaudy colouring. Over the\r\nlower range of table, the roof, as we have noticed, had no covering;\r\nthe rough plastered walls were left bare, and the rude earthen floor\r\nwas uncarpeted; the board was uncovered by a cloth, and rude massive\r\nbenches supplied the place of chairs.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the upper table, were placed two chairs more elevated\r\nthan the rest, for the master and mistress of the family, who presided\r\nover the scene of hospitality, and from doing so derived their Saxon\r\ntitle of honour, which signifies \xe2\x80\x9cthe Dividers of Bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo each of these chairs was added a footstool, curiously carved and\r\ninlaid with ivory, which mark of distinction was peculiar to them. One\r\nof these seats was at present occupied by Cedric the Saxon, who, though\r\nbut in rank a thane, or, as the Normans called him, a Franklin, felt,\r\nat the delay of his evening meal, an irritable impatience, which might\r\nhave become an alderman, whether of ancient or of modern times.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, indeed, from the countenance of this proprietor, that he\r\nwas of a frank, but hasty and choleric temper. He was not above the\r\nmiddle stature, but broad-shouldered, long-armed, and powerfully made,\r\nlike one accustomed to endure the fatigue of war or of the chase; his\r\nface was broad, with large blue eyes, open and frank features, fine\r\nteeth, and a well formed head, altogether expressive of that sort of\r\ngood-humour which often lodges with a sudden and hasty temper. Pride\r\nand jealousy there was in his eye, for his life had been spent in\r\nasserting rights which were constantly liable to invasion; and the\r\nprompt, fiery, and resolute disposition of the man, had been kept\r\nconstantly upon the alert by the circumstances of his situation. His\r\nlong yellow hair was equally divided on the top of his head and upon\r\nhis brow, and combed down on each side to the length of his shoulders;\r\nit had but little tendency to grey, although Cedric was approaching to\r\nhis sixtieth year.\r\n\r\nHis dress was a tunic of forest green, furred at the throat and cuffs\r\nwith what was called minever; a kind of fur inferior in quality to\r\nermine, and formed, it is believed, of the skin of the grey squirrel.\r\nThis doublet hung unbuttoned over a close dress of scarlet which sat\r\ntight to his body; he had breeches of the same, but they did not reach\r\nbelow the lower part of the thigh, leaving the knee exposed. His feet\r\nhad sandals of the same fashion with the peasants, but of finer\r\nmaterials, and secured in the front with golden clasps. He had\r\nbracelets of gold upon his arms, and a broad collar of the same\r\nprecious metal around his neck. About his waist he wore a\r\nrichly-studded belt, in which was stuck a short straight two-edged\r\nsword, with a sharp point, so disposed as to hang almost\r\nperpendicularly by his side. Behind his seat was hung a scarlet cloth\r\ncloak lined with fur, and a cap of the same materials richly\r\nembroidered, which completed the dress of the opulent landholder when\r\nhe chose to go forth. A short boar-spear, with a broad and bright steel\r\nhead, also reclined against the back of his chair, which served him,\r\nwhen he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or of a weapon, as\r\nchance might require.\r\n\r\nSeveral domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the\r\nrichness of their master\xe2\x80\x99s, and the coarse and simple attire of Gurth\r\nthe swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the Saxon\r\ndignitary. Two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their\r\nmaster upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall.\r\nOther attendants there were of a different description; two or three\r\nlarge and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the\r\nstag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick\r\nnecks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs,\r\nnow called terriers, which waited with impatience the arrival of the\r\nsupper; but, with the sagacious knowledge of physiognomy peculiar to\r\ntheir race, forbore to intrude upon the moody silence of their master,\r\napprehensive probably of a small white truncheon which lay by Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrencher, for the purpose of repelling the advances of his four-legged\r\ndependants. One grisly old wolf-dog alone, with the liberty of an\r\nindulged favourite, had planted himself close by the chair of state,\r\nand occasionally ventured to solicit notice by putting his large hairy\r\nhead upon his master\xe2\x80\x99s knee, or pushing his nose into his hand. Even he\r\nwas repelled by the stern command, \xe2\x80\x9cDown, Balder, down! I am not in the\r\nhumour for foolery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of\r\nmind. The Lady Rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at\r\na distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,\r\nwhich had been wetted by the storm. There were as yet no tidings of\r\nGurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home\r\nfrom the forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render\r\nit probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of\r\nthe outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence\r\nof some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made him\r\nequally negligent of the laws of property. The matter was of\r\nconsequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the Saxon\r\nproprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in\r\nforest-land, where those animals easily found their food.\r\n\r\nBesides these subjects of anxiety, the Saxon thane was impatient for\r\nthe presence of his favourite clown Wamba, whose jests, such as they\r\nwere, served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the\r\ndeep draughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of\r\naccompanying it. Add to all this, Cedric had fasted since noon, and his\r\nusual supper hour was long past, a cause of irritation common to\r\ncountry squires, both in ancient and modern times. His displeasure was\r\nexpressed in broken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly\r\naddressed to the domestics who stood around; and particularly to his\r\ncupbearer, who offered him from time to time, as a sedative, a silver\r\ngoblet filled with wine\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy tarries the Lady Rowena?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is but changing her head-gear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a female attendant, with\r\nas much confidence as the favourite lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid usually answers the\r\nmaster of a modern family; \xe2\x80\x9cyou would not wish her to sit down to the\r\nbanquet in her hood and kirtle? and no lady within the shire can be\r\nquicker in arraying herself than my mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the\r\npart of the Saxon, with the addition, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish her devotion may choose\r\nfair weather for the next visit to St John\xe2\x80\x99s Kirk;\xe2\x80\x94but what, in the\r\nname of ten devils,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and\r\nraising his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he\r\nmight divert his indignation without fear or control\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat, in the name\r\nof ten devils, keeps Gurth so long afield? I suppose we shall have an\r\nevil account of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious\r\ndrudge, and I had destined him for something better; perchance I might\r\neven have made him one of my warders.\xe2\x80\x9d 11\r\n\r\nOswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it was scarce an hour\r\nsince the tolling of the curfew;\xe2\x80\x9d an ill-chosen apology, since it\r\nturned upon a topic so harsh to Saxon ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foul fiend,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9ctake the curfew-bell, and the\r\ntyrannical bastard by whom it was devised, and the heartless slave who\r\nnames it with a Saxon tongue to a Saxon ear! The curfew!\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\npausing, \xe2\x80\x9cay, the curfew; which compels true men to extinguish their\r\nlights, that thieves and robbers may work their deeds in darkness!\xe2\x80\x94Ay,\r\nthe curfew;\xe2\x80\x94Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and Philip de Malvoisin know the use\r\nof the curfew as well as William the Bastard himself, or e\xe2\x80\x99er a Norman\r\nadventurer that fought at Hastings. I shall hear, I guess, that my\r\nproperty has been swept off to save from starving the hungry banditti,\r\nwhom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. My faithful slave is\r\nmurdered, and my goods are taken for a prey\xe2\x80\x94and Wamba\xe2\x80\x94where is Wamba?\r\nSaid not some one he had gone forth with Gurth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOswald replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the Saxon\r\nfool, to serve the Norman lord. Fools are we all indeed that serve\r\nthem, and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were\r\nborn with but half our wits. But I will be avenged,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, starting\r\nfrom his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold\r\nof his boar-spear; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go with my complaint to the great council; I\r\nhave friends, I have followers\xe2\x80\x94man to man will I appeal the Norman to\r\nthe lists; let him come in his plate and his mail, and all that can\r\nrender cowardice bold; I have sent such a javelin as this through a\r\nstronger fence than three of their war shields!\xe2\x80\x94Haply they think me\r\nold; but they shall find, alone and childless as I am, the blood of\r\nHereward is in the veins of Cedric.\xe2\x80\x94Ah, Wilfred, Wilfred!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed\r\nin a lower tone, \xe2\x80\x9ccouldst thou have ruled thine unreasonable passion,\r\nthy father had not been left in his age like the solitary oak that\r\nthrows out its shattered and unprotected branches against the full\r\nsweep of the tempest!\xe2\x80\x9d The reflection seemed to conjure into sadness\r\nhis irritated feelings. Replacing his javelin, he resumed his seat,\r\nbent his looks downward, and appeared to be absorbed in melancholy\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nFrom his musing, Cedric was suddenly awakened by the blast of a horn,\r\nwhich was replied to by the clamorous yells and barking of all the dogs\r\nin the hall, and some twenty or thirty which were quartered in other\r\nparts of the building. It cost some exercise of the white truncheon,\r\nwell seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine\r\nclamour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the gate, knaves!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saxon, hastily, as soon as the tumult\r\nwas so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSee\r\nwhat tidings that horn tells us of\xe2\x80\x94to announce, I ween, some hership 12\r\nand robbery which has been done upon my lands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReturning in less than three minutes, a warder announced \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nPrior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and the good knight Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\r\ncommander of the valiant and venerable order of Knights Templars, with\r\na small retinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being\r\non their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouche, on the second day from the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAymer, the Prior Aymer? Brian de Bois-Guilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94muttered Cedric;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNormans both;\xe2\x80\x94but Norman or Saxon, the hospitality of Rotherwood must\r\nnot be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt\xe2\x80\x94more\r\nwelcome would they have been to have ridden further on their way\xe2\x80\x94But it\r\nwere unworthy to murmur for a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging and a night\xe2\x80\x99s food; in\r\nthe quality of guests, at least, even Normans must suppress their\r\ninsolence.\xe2\x80\x94Go, Hundebert,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, to a sort of major-domo who stood\r\nbehind him with a white wand; \xe2\x80\x9ctake six of the attendants, and\r\nintroduce the strangers to the guests\xe2\x80\x99 lodging. Look after their horses\r\nand mules, and see their train lack nothing. Let them have change of\r\nvestments if they require it, and fire, and water to wash, and wine and\r\nale; and bid the cooks add what they hastily can to our evening meal;\r\nand let it be put on the board when those strangers are ready to share\r\nit. Say to them, Hundebert, that Cedric would himself bid them welcome,\r\nbut he is under a vow never to step more than three steps from the dais\r\nof his own hall to meet any who shares not the blood of Saxon royalty.\r\nBegone! see them carefully tended; let them not say in their pride, the\r\nSaxon churl has shown at once his poverty and his avarice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe major-domo departed with several attendants, to execute his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s commands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prior Aymer!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Cedric, looking to Oswald, \xe2\x80\x9cthe brother, if\r\nI mistake not, of Giles de Mauleverer, now lord of Middleham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOswald made a respectful sign of assent. \xe2\x80\x9cHis brother sits in the seat,\r\nand usurps the patrimony, of a better race, the race of Ulfgar of\r\nMiddleham; but what Norman lord doth not the same? This Prior is, they\r\nsay, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the\r\nbugle-horn better than bell and book: Good; let him come, he shall be\r\nwelcome. How named ye the Templar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrian de Bois-Guilbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBois-Guilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone,\r\nwhich the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to\r\nemploy, and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to\r\nthose around him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBois-Guilbert? that name has been spread wide both\r\nfor good and evil. They say he is valiant as the bravest of his order;\r\nbut stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and\r\nvoluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth,\r\nnor awe of heaven. So say the few warriors who have returned from\r\nPalestine.\xe2\x80\x94Well; it is but for one night; he shall be welcome\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x94Oswald, broach the oldest wine-cask; place the best mead, the\r\nmightiest ale, the richest morat, the most sparkling cider, the most\r\nodoriferous pigments, upon the board; fill the largest horns 13\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Templars and Abbots love good wines and good measure.\xe2\x80\x94Elgitha, let thy\r\nLady Rowena, know we shall not this night expect her in the hall,\r\nunless such be her especial pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will be her especial pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Elgitha, with great\r\nreadiness, \xe2\x80\x9cfor she is ever desirous to hear the latest news from\r\nPalestine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric darted at the forward damsel a glance of hasty resentment; but\r\nRowena, and whatever belonged to her, were privileged and secure from\r\nhis anger. He only replied, \xe2\x80\x9cSilence, maiden; thy tongue outruns thy\r\ndiscretion. Say my message to thy mistress, and let her do her\r\npleasure. Here, at least, the descendant of Alfred still reigns a\r\nprincess.\xe2\x80\x9d Elgitha left the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPalestine!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Saxon; \xe2\x80\x9cPalestine! how many ears are turned\r\nto the tales which dissolute crusaders, or hypocritical pilgrims, bring\r\nfrom that fatal land! I too might ask\xe2\x80\x94I too might enquire\xe2\x80\x94I too might\r\nlisten with a beating heart to fables which the wily strollers devise\r\nto cheat us into hospitality\xe2\x80\x94but no\xe2\x80\x94The son who has disobeyed me is no\r\nlonger mine; nor will I concern myself more for his fate than for that\r\nof the most worthless among the millions that ever shaped the cross on\r\ntheir shoulder, rushed into excess and blood-guiltiness, and called it\r\nan accomplishment of the will of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe knit his brows, and fixed his eyes for an instant on the ground; as\r\nhe raised them, the folding doors at the bottom of the hall were cast\r\nwide, and, preceded by the major-domo with his wand, and four domestics\r\nbearing blazing torches, the guests of the evening entered the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWith sheep and shaggy goats the porkers bled,\r\nAnd the proud steer was on the marble spread;\r\nWith fire prepared, they deal the morsels round,\r\nWine rosy bright the brimming goblets crown\xe2\x80\x99d.\r\n\r\nDisposed apart, Ulysses shares the treat;\r\nA trivet table and ignobler seat,\r\nThe Prince assigns\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nODYSSEY, _Book_ XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prior Aymer had taken the opportunity afforded him, of changing his\r\nriding robe for one of yet more costly materials, over which he wore a\r\ncope curiously embroidered. Besides the massive golden signet ring,\r\nwhich marked his ecclesiastical dignity, his fingers, though contrary\r\nto the canon, were loaded with precious gems; his sandals were of the\r\nfinest leather which was imported from Spain; his beard trimmed to as\r\nsmall dimensions as his order would possibly permit, and his shaven\r\ncrown concealed by a scarlet cap richly embroidered.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Knight Templar was also changed; and, though less\r\nstudiously bedecked with ornament, his dress was as rich, and his\r\nappearance far more commanding, than that of his companion. He had\r\nexchanged his shirt of mail for an under tunic of dark purple silk,\r\ngarnished with furs, over which flowed his long robe of spotless white,\r\nin ample folds. The eight-pointed cross of his order was cut on the\r\nshoulder of his mantle in black velvet. The high cap no longer invested\r\nhis brows, which were only shaded by short and thick curled hair of a\r\nraven blackness, corresponding to his unusually swart complexion.\r\nNothing could be more gracefully majestic than his step and manner, had\r\nthey not been marked by a predominant air of haughtiness, easily\r\nacquired by the exercise of unresisted authority.\r\n\r\nThese two dignified persons were followed by their respective\r\nattendants, and at a more humble distance by their guide, whose figure\r\nhad nothing more remarkable than it derived from the usual weeds of a\r\npilgrim. A cloak or mantle of coarse black serge, enveloped his whole\r\nbody. It was in shape something like the cloak of a modern hussar,\r\nhaving similar flaps for covering the arms, and was called a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSclaveyn\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9cSclavonian\xe2\x80\x9d. Coarse sandals, bound with thongs, on his\r\nbare feet; a broad and shadowy hat, with cockle-shells stitched on its\r\nbrim, and a long staff shod with iron, to the upper end of which was\r\nattached a branch of palm, completed the palmer\xe2\x80\x99s attire. He followed\r\nmodestly the last of the train which entered the hall, and, observing\r\nthat the lower table scarce afforded room sufficient for the domestics\r\nof Cedric and the retinue of his guests, he withdrew to a settle placed\r\nbeside and almost under one of the large chimneys, and seemed to employ\r\nhimself in drying his garments, until the retreat of some one should\r\nmake room at the board, or the hospitality of the steward should supply\r\nhim with refreshments in the place he had chosen apart.\r\n\r\nCedric rose to receive his guests with an air of dignified hospitality,\r\nand, descending from the dais, or elevated part of his hall, made three\r\nsteps towards them, and then awaited their approach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grieve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9creverend Prior, that my vow binds me to advance\r\nno farther upon this floor of my fathers, even to receive such guests\r\nas you, and this valiant Knight of the Holy Temple. But my steward has\r\nexpounded to you the cause of my seeming discourtesy. Let me also pray,\r\nthat you will excuse my speaking to you in my native language, and that\r\nyou will reply in the same if your knowledge of it permits; if not, I\r\nsufficiently understand Norman to follow your meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVows,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbot, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be unloosed, worthy Franklin, or permit\r\nme rather to say, worthy Thane, though the title is antiquated. Vows\r\nare the knots which tie us to Heaven\xe2\x80\x94they are the cords which bind the\r\nsacrifice to the horns of the altar,\xe2\x80\x94and are therefore,\xe2\x80\x94as I said\r\nbefore,\xe2\x80\x94to be unloosened and discharged, unless our holy Mother Church\r\nshall pronounce the contrary. And respecting language, I willingly hold\r\ncommunication in that spoken by my respected grandmother, Hilda of\r\nMiddleham, who died in odour of sanctity, little short, if we may\r\npresume to say so, of her glorious namesake, the blessed Saint Hilda of\r\nWhitby, God be gracious to her soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the Prior had ceased what he meant as a conciliatory harangue, his\r\ncompanion said briefly and emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cI speak ever French, the\r\nlanguage of King Richard and his nobles; but I understand English\r\nsufficiently to communicate with the natives of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric darted at the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances,\r\nwhich comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call\r\nforth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed\r\nfurther show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his\r\nguests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed\r\nclose beside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be\r\nplaced upon the board.\r\n\r\nWhile the attendants hastened to obey Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s commands, his eye\r\ndistinguished Gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion Wamba, had\r\njust entered the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cSend these loitering knaves up hither,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Saxon, impatiently. And when the culprits came before the\r\ndais,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as\r\nthis? Hast thou brought home thy charge, sirrah Gurth, or hast thou\r\nleft them to robbers and marauders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe herd is safe, so please ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it does not please me, thou knave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should be\r\nmade to suppose otherwise for two hours, and sit here devising\r\nvengeance against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. I\r\ntell thee, shackles and the prison-house shall punish the next offence\r\nof this kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth, knowing his master\xe2\x80\x99s irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;\r\nbut the Jester, who could presume upon Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance, by virtue of\r\nhis privileges as a fool, replied for them both; \xe2\x80\x9cIn troth, uncle\r\nCedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said his master; \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall to the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, and\r\ntaste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst let your wisdom tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cis it just and reasonable\r\nto punish one person for the fault of another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not, fool,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why should you shackle poor Gurth, uncle, for the fault of his\r\ndog Fangs? for I dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we\r\nhad got our herd together, which Fangs did not manage until we heard\r\nthe vesper-bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hang up Fangs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, turning hastily towards the\r\nswineherd, \xe2\x80\x9cif the fault is his, and get thee another dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder favour, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cthat were still somewhat on\r\nthe bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of Fangs that he was\r\nlame and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck\r\noff two of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow\r\nhad been consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Saxon, kindling in wrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, that did old Hubert,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Philip de Malvoisin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkeeper of the chase. He caught Fangs strolling in the forest, and said\r\nhe chased the deer contrary to his master\xe2\x80\x99s right, as warden of the\r\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foul fiend take Malvoisin,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9cand his keeper\r\nboth! I will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of the\r\ngreat Forest Charter. But enough of this. Go to, knave, go to thy\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94and thou, Gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare\r\nto touch it, I will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head,\r\nif I strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!\xe2\x80\x94he shall draw\r\nbowstring no more.\xe2\x80\x94I crave your pardon, my worthy guests. I am beset\r\nhere with neighbours that match your infidels, Sir Knight, in Holy\r\nLand. But your homely fare is before you; feed, and let welcome make\r\namends for hard fare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe feast, however, which was spread upon the board, needed no\r\napologies from the lord of the mansion. Swine\xe2\x80\x99s flesh, dressed in\r\nseveral modes, appeared on the lower part of the board, as also that of\r\nfowls, deer, goats, and hares, and various kinds of fish, together with\r\nhuge loaves and cakes of bread, and sundry confections made of fruits\r\nand honey. The smaller sorts of wild-fowl, of which there was\r\nabundance, were not served up in platters, but brought in upon small\r\nwooden spits or broaches, and offered by the pages and domestics who\r\nbore them, to each guest in succession, who cut from them such a\r\nportion as he pleased. Beside each person of rank was placed a goblet\r\nof silver; the lower board was accommodated with large drinking horns.\r\n\r\nWhen the repast was about to commence, the major-domo, or steward,\r\nsuddenly raising his wand, said aloud,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cForbear!\xe2\x80\x94Place for the Lady\r\nRowena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA side-door at the upper end of the hall now opened behind the banquet\r\ntable, and Rowena, followed by four female attendants, entered the\r\napartment. Cedric, though surprised, and perhaps not altogether\r\nagreeably so, at his ward appearing in public on this occasion,\r\nhastened to meet her, and to conduct her, with respectful ceremony, to\r\nthe elevated seat at his own right hand, appropriated to the lady of\r\nthe mansion. All stood up to receive her; and, replying to their\r\ncourtesy by a mute gesture of salutation, she moved gracefully forward\r\nto assume her place at the board. Ere she had time to do so, the\r\nTemplar whispered to the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall wear no collar of gold of\r\nyours at the tournament. The Chian wine is your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid I not so?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9cbut check your raptures, the\r\nFranklin observes you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the\r\nimmediate impulse of his own wishes, Brian de Bois-Guilbert kept his\r\neyes riveted on the Saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his\r\nimagination, because differing widely from those of the Eastern\r\nsultanas.\r\n\r\nFormed in the best proportions of her sex, Rowena was tall in stature,\r\nyet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior\r\nheight. Her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her\r\nhead and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches to\r\nfair beauties. Her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a\r\ngraceful eyebrow of brown sufficiently marked to give expression to the\r\nforehead, seemed capable to kindle as well as melt, to command as well\r\nas to beseech. If mildness were the more natural expression of such a\r\ncombination of features, it was plain, that in the present instance,\r\nthe exercise of habitual superiority, and the reception of general\r\nhomage, had given to the Saxon lady a loftier character, which mingled\r\nwith and qualified that bestowed by nature. Her profuse hair, of a\r\ncolour betwixt brown and flaxen, was arranged in a fanciful and\r\ngraceful manner in numerous ringlets, to form which art had probably\r\naided nature. These locks were braided with gems, and, being worn at\r\nfull length, intimated the noble birth and free-born condition of the\r\nmaiden. A golden chain, to which was attached a small reliquary of the\r\nsame metal, hung round her neck. She wore bracelets on her arms, which\r\nwere bare. Her dress was an under-gown and kirtle of pale sea-green\r\nsilk, over which hung a long loose robe, which reached to the ground,\r\nhaving very wide sleeves, which came down, however, very little below\r\nthe elbow. This robe was crimson, and manufactured out of the very\r\nfinest wool. A veil of silk, interwoven with gold, was attached to the\r\nupper part of it, which could be, at the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure, either\r\ndrawn over the face and bosom after the Spanish fashion, or disposed as\r\na sort of drapery round the shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen Rowena perceived the Knight Templar\xe2\x80\x99s eyes bent on her with an\r\nardour, that, compared with the dark caverns under which they moved,\r\ngave them the effect of lighted charcoal, she drew with dignity the\r\nveil around her face, as an intimation that the determined freedom of\r\nhis glance was disagreeable. Cedric saw the motion and its cause. \xe2\x80\x9cSir\r\nTemplar,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cheeks of our Saxon maidens have seen too\r\nlittle of the sun to enable them to bear the fixed glance of a\r\ncrusader.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have offended,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Brian, \xe2\x80\x9cI crave your pardon,\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nI crave the Lady Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x94for my humility will carry me no\r\nlower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9chas punished us all, in chastising\r\nthe boldness of my friend. Let me hope she will be less cruel to the\r\nsplendid train which are to meet at the tournament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur going thither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cis uncertain. I love not these\r\nvanities, which were unknown to my fathers when England was free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hope, nevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cour company may determine\r\nyou to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of\r\nSir Brian de Bois-Guilbert is not to be despised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9cwheresoever I have travelled in this\r\nland, I have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good\r\nsword and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. At\r\npresent, if we indeed journey to Ashby-de-la-Zouche, we do so with my\r\nnoble neighbour and countryman Athelstane of Coningsburgh, and with\r\nsuch a train as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndrink to you, Sir Prior, in this cup of wine, which I trust your taste\r\nwill approve, and I thank you for your courtesy. Should you be so rigid\r\nin adhering to monastic rule,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cas to prefer your acid\r\npreparation of milk, I hope you will not strain courtesy to do me\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Priest, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cit is only in our abbey that we\r\nconfine ourselves to the \xe2\x80\x98lac dulce\xe2\x80\x99 or the \xe2\x80\x98lac acidum\xe2\x80\x99 either.\r\nConversing with, the world, we use the world\xe2\x80\x99s fashions, and therefore\r\nI answer your pledge in this honest wine, and leave the weaker liquor\r\nto my lay-brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, filling his goblet, \xe2\x80\x9cdrink wassail to the\r\nfair Rowena; for since her namesake introduced the word into England,\r\nhas never been one more worthy of such a tribute. By my faith, I could\r\npardon the unhappy Vortigern, had he half the cause that we now\r\nwitness, for making shipwreck of his honour and his kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will spare your courtesy, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena with dignity, and\r\nwithout unveiling herself; \xe2\x80\x9cor rather I will tax it so far as to\r\nrequire of you the latest news from Palestine, a theme more agreeable\r\nto our English ears than the compliments which your French breeding\r\nteaches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have little of importance to say, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cexcepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with\r\nSaladin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by Wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon a\r\nchair, the back of which was decorated with two ass\xe2\x80\x99s ears, and which\r\nwas placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time to\r\ntime, supplied him with victuals from his own trencher; a favour,\r\nhowever, which the Jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as\r\nwe have already noticed, there were several in attendance. Here sat\r\nWamba, with a small table before him, his heels tucked up against the\r\nbar of the chair, his cheeks sucked up so as to make his jaws resemble\r\na pair of nut-crackers, and his eyes half-shut, yet watching with\r\nalertness every opportunity to exercise his licensed foolery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese truces with the infidels,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, without caring how\r\nsuddenly he interrupted the stately Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cmake an old man of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to, knave, how so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, his features prepared to receive\r\nfavourably the expected jest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember three of them in my day, each of\r\nwhich was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by\r\ncomputation, I must be at least a hundred and fifty years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will warrant you against dying of old age, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nTemplar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; \xe2\x80\x9cI will assure\r\nyou from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to\r\nwayfarers, as you did this night to the Prior and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, sirrah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cmisdirect travellers? We must have you\r\nwhipt; you are at least as much rogue as fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray thee, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9clet my folly, for once,\r\nprotect my roguery. I did but make a mistake between my right hand and\r\nmy left; and he might have pardoned a greater, who took a fool for his\r\ncounsellor and guide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConversation was here interrupted by the entrance of the porter\xe2\x80\x99s page,\r\nwho announced that there was a stranger at the gate, imploring\r\nadmittance and hospitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cbe he who or what he may;\xe2\x80\x94a night like that\r\nwhich roars without, compels even wild animals to herd with tame, and\r\nto seek the protection of man, their mortal foe, rather than perish by\r\nthe elements. Let his wants be ministered to with all care\xe2\x80\x94look to it,\r\nOswald.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the steward left the banqueting hall to see the commands of his\r\npatron obeyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nHath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,\r\naffections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same\r\nweapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed\r\nand cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCHANT OF VENICE\r\n\r\n\r\nOswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a Jew,\r\nwho calls himself Isaac of York; is it fit I should marshall him into\r\nthe hall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Gurth do thine office, Oswald,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba with his usual\r\neffrontery; \xe2\x80\x9cthe swineherd will be a fit usher to the Jew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbot, crossing himself, \xe2\x80\x9can unbelieving Jew, and\r\nadmitted into this presence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dog Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cto approach a defender of the Holy\r\nSepulchre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cit would seem the Templars love the Jews\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninheritance better than they do their company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, my worthy guests,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cmy hospitality must not be\r\nbounded by your dislikes. If Heaven bore with the whole nation of\r\nstiff-necked unbelievers for more years than a layman can number, we\r\nmay endure the presence of one Jew for a few hours. But I constrain no\r\nman to converse or to feed with him.\xe2\x80\x94Let him have a board and a morsel\r\napart,\xe2\x80\x94unless,\xe2\x80\x9d he said smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthese turban\xe2\x80\x99d strangers will admit\r\nhis society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Franklin,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cmy Saracen slaves are true\r\nMoslems, and scorn as much as any Christian to hold intercourse with a\r\nJew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, in faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see that the worshippers of\r\nMahound and Termagaunt have so greatly the advantage over the people\r\nonce chosen of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall sit with thee, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fool and the knave\r\nwill be well met.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fool,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba, raising the relics of a gammon of bacon,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill take care to erect a bulwark against the knave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cfor here he comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIntroduced with little ceremony, and advancing with fear and\r\nhesitation, and many a bow of deep humility, a tall thin old man, who,\r\nhowever, had lost by the habit of stooping much of his actual height,\r\napproached the lower end of the board. His features, keen and regular,\r\nwith an aquiline nose, and piercing black eyes; his high and wrinkled\r\nforehead, and long grey hair and beard, would have been considered as\r\nhandsome, had they not been the marks of a physiognomy peculiar to a\r\nrace, which, during those dark ages, was alike detested by the\r\ncredulous and prejudiced vulgar, and persecuted by the greedy and\r\nrapacious nobility, and who, perhaps, owing to that very hatred and\r\npersecution, had adopted a national character, in which there was much,\r\nto say the least, mean and unamiable.\r\n\r\nThe Jew\xe2\x80\x99s dress, which appeared to have suffered considerably from the\r\nstorm, was a plain russet cloak of many folds, covering a dark purple\r\ntunic. He had large boots lined with fur, and a belt around his waist,\r\nwhich sustained a small knife, together with a case for writing\r\nmaterials, but no weapon. He wore a high square yellow cap of a\r\npeculiar fashion, assigned to his nation to distinguish them from\r\nChristians, and which he doffed with great humility at the door of the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nThe reception of this person in the hall of Cedric the Saxon, was such\r\nas might have satisfied the most prejudiced enemy of the tribes of\r\nIsrael. Cedric himself coldly nodded in answer to the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s repeated\r\nsalutations, and signed to him to take place at the lower end of the\r\ntable, where, however, no one offered to make room for him. On the\r\ncontrary, as he passed along the file, casting a timid supplicating\r\nglance, and turning towards each of those who occupied the lower end of\r\nthe board, the Saxon domestics squared their shoulders, and continued\r\nto devour their supper with great perseverance, paying not the least\r\nattention to the wants of the new guest. The attendants of the Abbot\r\ncrossed themselves, with looks of pious horror, and the very heathen\r\nSaracens, as Isaac drew near them, curled up their whiskers with\r\nindignation, and laid their hands on their poniards, as if ready to rid\r\nthemselves by the most desperate means from the apprehended\r\ncontamination of his nearer approach.\r\n\r\nProbably the same motives which induced Cedric to open his hall to this\r\nson of a rejected people, would have made him insist on his attendants\r\nreceiving Isaac with more courtesy. But the Abbot had, at this moment,\r\nengaged him in a most interesting discussion on the breed and character\r\nof his favourite hounds, which he would not have interrupted for\r\nmatters of much greater importance than that of a Jew going to bed\r\nsupperless. While Isaac thus stood an outcast in the present society,\r\nlike his people among the nations, looking in vain for welcome or\r\nresting place, the pilgrim who sat by the chimney took compassion upon\r\nhim, and resigned his seat, saying briefly, \xe2\x80\x9cOld man, my garments are\r\ndried, my hunger is appeased, thou art both wet and fasting.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he gathered together, and brought to a flame, the decaying\r\nbrands which lay scattered on the ample hearth; took from the larger\r\nboard a mess of pottage and seethed kid, placed it upon the small table\r\nat which he had himself supped, and, without waiting the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s thanks,\r\nwent to the other side of the hall;\xe2\x80\x94whether from unwillingness to hold\r\nmore close communication with the object of his benevolence, or from a\r\nwish to draw near to the upper end of the table, seemed uncertain.\r\n\r\nHad there been painters in those days capable to execute such a\r\nsubject, the Jew, as he bent his withered form, and expanded his\r\nchilled and trembling hands over the fire, would have formed no bad\r\nemblematical personification of the Winter season. Having dispelled the\r\ncold, he turned eagerly to the smoking mess which was placed before\r\nhim, and ate with a haste and an apparent relish, that seemed to\r\nbetoken long abstinence from food.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Abbot and Cedric continued their discourse upon hunting;\r\nthe Lady Rowena seemed engaged in conversation with one of her\r\nattendant females; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered from the\r\nJew to the Saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared\r\ndeeply to interest him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI marvel, worthy Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbot, as their discourse\r\nproceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, great as your predilection is for your own manly\r\nlanguage, you do not receive the Norman-French into your favour, so far\r\nat least as the mystery of wood-craft and hunting is concerned. Surely\r\nno tongue is so rich in the various phrases which the field-sports\r\ndemand, or furnishes means to the experienced woodman so well to\r\nexpress his jovial art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Father Aymer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9cbe it known to you, I care not\r\nfor those over-sea refinements, without which I can well enough take my\r\npleasure in the woods. I can wind my horn, though I call not the blast\r\neither a \xe2\x80\x98recheate\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98morte\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I can cheer my dogs on the prey, and I\r\ncan flay and quarter the animal when it is brought down, without using\r\nthe newfangled jargon of \xe2\x80\x98curee, arbor, nombles\xe2\x80\x99, and all the babble of\r\nthe fabulous Sir Tristrem.\xe2\x80\x9d 14\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe French,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, raising his voice with the presumptuous\r\nand authoritative tone which he used upon all occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cis not only\r\nthe natural language of the chase, but that of love and of war, in\r\nwhich ladies should be won and enemies defied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPledge me in a cup of wine, Sir Templar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cand fill\r\nanother to the Abbot, while I look back some thirty years to tell you\r\nanother tale. As Cedric the Saxon then was, his plain English tale\r\nneeded no garnish from French troubadours, when it was told in the ear\r\nof beauty; and the field of Northallerton, upon the day of the Holy\r\nStandard, could tell whether the Saxon war-cry was not heard as far\r\nwithin the ranks of the Scottish host as the \xe2\x80\x98cri de guerre\xe2\x80\x99 of the\r\nboldest Norman baron. To the memory of the brave who fought\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x94Pledge me, my guests.\xe2\x80\x9d He drank deep, and went on with\r\nincreasing warmth. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, that was a day of cleaving of shields, when a\r\nhundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant, and\r\nblood flowed round like water, and death was held better than flight. A\r\nSaxon bard had called it a feast of the swords\xe2\x80\x94a gathering of the\r\neagles to the prey\xe2\x80\x94the clashing of bills upon shield and helmet, the\r\nshouting of battle more joyful than the clamour of a bridal. But our\r\nbards are no more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cour deeds are lost in those of another\r\nrace\xe2\x80\x94our language\xe2\x80\x94our very name\xe2\x80\x94is hastening to decay, and none mourns\r\nfor it save one solitary old man\xe2\x80\x94Cupbearer! knave, fill the goblets\xe2\x80\x94To\r\nthe strong in arms, Sir Templar, be their race or language what it\r\nwill, who now bear them best in Palestine among the champions of the\r\nCross!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt becomes not one wearing this badge to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert; \xe2\x80\x9cyet to whom, besides the sworn Champions of the Holy\r\nSepulchre, can the palm be assigned among the champions of the Cross?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Knights Hospitallers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbot; \xe2\x80\x9cI have a brother of\r\ntheir order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI impeach not their fame,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cnevertheless\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, friend Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, interfering, \xe2\x80\x9cthat had Richard of\r\nthe Lion\xe2\x80\x99s Heart been wise enough to have taken a fool\xe2\x80\x99s advice, he\r\nmight have staid at home with his merry Englishmen, and left the\r\nrecovery of Jerusalem to those same Knights who had most to do with the\r\nloss of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere there, then, none in the English army,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lady Rowena,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhose names are worthy to be mentioned with the Knights of the Temple,\r\nand of St John?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bois-Guilbert; \xe2\x80\x9cthe English monarch did,\r\nindeed, bring to Palestine a host of gallant warriors, second only to\r\nthose whose breasts have been the unceasing bulwark of that blessed\r\nland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond to NONE,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim, who had stood near enough to hear,\r\nand had listened to this conversation with marked impatience. All\r\nturned toward the spot from whence this unexpected asseveration was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the Pilgrim in a firm and strong voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the\r\nEnglish chivalry were second to NONE who ever drew sword in defence of\r\nthe Holy Land. I say besides, for I saw it, that King Richard himself,\r\nand five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of St\r\nJohn-de-Acre, as challengers against all comers. I say that, on that\r\nday, each knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three\r\nantagonists. I add, that seven of these assailants were Knights of the\r\nTemple\xe2\x80\x94and Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert well knows the truth of what I\r\ntell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage\r\nwhich rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the Templar. In\r\nthe extremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers\r\ngriped towards the handle of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from\r\nthe consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in\r\nthat place and presence. Cedric, whose feelings were all of a right\r\nonward and simple kind, and were seldom occupied by more than one\r\nobject at once, omitted, in the joyous glee with which he heard of the\r\nglory of his countrymen, to remark the angry confusion of his guest; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould give thee this golden bracelet, Pilgrim,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ccouldst thou\r\ntell me the names of those knights who upheld so gallantly the renown\r\nof merry England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will I do blithely,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Pilgrim, \xe2\x80\x9cand without guerdon;\r\nmy oath, for a time, prohibits me from touching gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wear the bracelet for you, if you will, friend Palmer,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWamba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first in honour as in arms, in renown as in place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPilgrim, \xe2\x80\x9cwas the brave Richard, King of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cI forgive him his descent from the\r\ntyrant Duke William.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Earl of Leicester was the second,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Pilgrim; \xe2\x80\x9cSir\r\nThomas Multon of Gilsland was the third.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Saxon descent, he at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, with exultation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Foulk Doilly the fourth,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the Pilgrim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaxon also, at least by the mother\xe2\x80\x99s side,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cedric, who\r\nlistened with the utmost eagerness, and forgot, in part at least, his\r\nhatred to the Normans, in the common triumph of the King of England and\r\nhis islanders. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who was the fifth?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fifth was Sir Edwin Turneham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenuine Saxon, by the soul of Hengist!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Cedric\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the\r\nsixth?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued with eagerness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chow name you the sixth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sixth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to\r\nrecollect himself, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,\r\nassumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than\r\nto make up their number\xe2\x80\x94his name dwells not in my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Palmer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert scornfully, \xe2\x80\x9cthis assumed\r\nforgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to\r\nserve your purpose. I will myself tell the name of the knight before\r\nwhose lance fortune and my horse\xe2\x80\x99s fault occasioned my falling\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\nthe Knight of Ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his\r\nyears, had more renown in arms.\xe2\x80\x94Yet this will I say, and loudly\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nwere he in England, and durst repeat, in this week\xe2\x80\x99s tournament, the\r\nchallenge of St John-de-Acre, I, mounted and armed as I now am, would\r\ngive him every advantage of weapons, and abide the result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour challenge would soon be answered,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cwere your\r\nantagonist near you. As the matter is, disturb not the peaceful hall\r\nwith vaunts of the issue of the conflict, which you well know cannot\r\ntake place. If Ivanhoe ever returns from Palestine, I will be his\r\nsurety that he meets you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA goodly security!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cand what do you proffer\r\nas a pledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis reliquary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, taking a small ivory box from his\r\nbosom, and crossing himself, \xe2\x80\x9ccontaining a portion of the true cross,\r\nbrought from the Monastery of Mount Carmel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prior of Jorvaulx crossed himself and repeated a pater noster, in\r\nwhich all devoutly joined, excepting the Jew, the Mahomedans, and the\r\nTemplar; the latter of whom, without vailing his bonnet, or testifying\r\nany reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck\r\na gold chain, which he flung on the board, saying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet Prior Aymer hold\r\nmy pledge and that of this nameless vagrant, in token that when the\r\nKnight of Ivanhoe comes within the four seas of Britain, he underlies\r\nthe challenge of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, which, if he answer not, I\r\nwill proclaim him as a coward on the walls of every Temple Court in\r\nEurope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not need,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lady Rowena, breaking silence; \xe2\x80\x9cMy voice\r\nshall be heard, if no other in this hall is raised in behalf of the\r\nabsent Ivanhoe. I affirm he will meet fairly every honourable\r\nchallenge. Could my weak warrant add security to the inestimable pledge\r\nof this holy pilgrim, I would pledge name and fame that Ivanhoe gives\r\nthis proud knight the meeting he desires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA crowd of conflicting emotions seemed to have occupied Cedric, and\r\nkept him silent during this discussion. Gratified pride, resentment,\r\nembarrassment, chased each other over his broad and open brow, like the\r\nshadow of clouds drifting over a harvest-field; while his attendants,\r\non whom the name of the sixth knight seemed to produce an effect almost\r\nelectrical, hung in suspense upon their master\xe2\x80\x99s looks. But when Rowena\r\nspoke, the sound of her voice seemed to startle him from his silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cthis beseems not; were further pledge necessary,\r\nI myself, offended, and justly offended, as I am, would yet gage my\r\nhonour for the honour of Ivanhoe. But the wager of battle is complete,\r\neven according to the fantastic fashions of Norman chivalry\xe2\x80\x94Is it not,\r\nFather Aymer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9cand the blessed relic and rich chain will\r\nI bestow safely in the treasury of our convent, until the decision of\r\nthis warlike challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, he crossed himself again and again, and after many\r\ngenuflections and muttered prayers, he delivered the reliquary to\r\nBrother Ambrose, his attendant monk, while he himself swept up with\r\nless ceremony, but perhaps with no less internal satisfaction, the\r\ngolden chain, and bestowed it in a pouch lined with perfumed leather,\r\nwhich opened under his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Sir Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy ears\r\nare chiming vespers with the strength of your good wine\xe2\x80\x94permit us\r\nanother pledge to the welfare of the Lady Rowena, and indulge us with\r\nliberty to pass to our repose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the rood of Bromholme,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do but small credit to\r\nyour fame, Sir Prior! Report speaks you a bonny monk, that would hear\r\nthe matin chime ere he quitted his bowl; and, old as I am, I feared to\r\nhave shame in encountering you. But, by my faith, a Saxon boy of\r\ntwelve, in my time, would not so soon have relinquished his goblet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prior had his own reasons, however, for persevering in the course\r\nof temperance which he had adopted. He was not only a professional\r\npeacemaker, but from practice a hater of all feuds and brawls. It was\r\nnot altogether from a love to his neighbour, or to himself, or from a\r\nmixture of both. On the present occasion, he had an instinctive\r\napprehension of the fiery temper of the Saxon, and saw the danger that\r\nthe reckless and presumptuous spirit, of which his companion had\r\nalready given so many proofs, might at length produce some disagreeable\r\nexplosion. He therefore gently insinuated the incapacity of the native\r\nof any other country to engage in the genial conflict of the bowl with\r\nthe hardy and strong-headed Saxons; something he mentioned, but\r\nslightly, about his own holy character, and ended by pressing his\r\nproposal to depart to repose.\r\n\r\nThe grace-cup was accordingly served round, and the guests, after\r\nmaking deep obeisance to their landlord and to the Lady Rowena, arose\r\nand mingled in the hall, while the heads of the family, by separate\r\ndoors, retired with their attendants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnbelieving dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar to Isaac the Jew, as he passed him\r\nin the throng, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou bend thy course to the tournament?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so propose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Isaac, bowing in all humility, \xe2\x80\x9cif it please\r\nyour reverend valour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cto gnaw the bowels of our nobles with usury,\r\nand to gull women and boys with gauds and toys\xe2\x80\x94I warrant thee store of\r\nshekels in thy Jewish scrip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a shekel, not a silver penny, not a halfling\xe2\x80\x94so help me the God of\r\nAbraham!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, clasping his hands; \xe2\x80\x9cI go but to seek the\r\nassistance of some brethren of my tribe to aid me to pay the fine which\r\nthe Exchequer of the Jews have imposed upon me\xe2\x80\x94Father Jacob be my\r\nspeed! I am an impoverished wretch\xe2\x80\x94the very gaberdine I wear is\r\nborrowed from Reuben of Tadcaster.\xe2\x80\x9d 15\r\n\r\nThe Templar smiled sourly as he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cBeshrew thee for a\r\nfalse-hearted liar!\xe2\x80\x9d and passing onward, as if disdaining farther\r\nconference, he communed with his Moslem slaves in a language unknown to\r\nthe bystanders. The poor Israelite seemed so staggered by the address\r\nof the military monk, that the Templar had passed on to the extremity\r\nof the hall ere he raised his head from the humble posture which he had\r\nassumed, so far as to be sensible of his departure. And when he did\r\nlook around, it was with the astonished air of one at whose feet a\r\nthunderbolt has just burst, and who hears still the astounding report\r\nringing in his ears.\r\n\r\nThe Templar and Prior were shortly after marshalled to their sleeping\r\napartments by the steward and the cupbearer, each attended by two\r\ntorchbearers and two servants carrying refreshments, while servants of\r\ninferior condition indicated to their retinue and to the other guests\r\ntheir respective places of repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nTo buy his favour I extend this friendship:\r\nIf he will take it, so; if not, adieu;\r\nAnd, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCHANT OF VENICE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the\r\nintricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular\r\nmansion, the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if\r\nhe had no objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment, there were\r\nmany domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had\r\nbrought from the Holy Land, and particularly that which concerned the\r\nKnight of Ivanhoe. Wamba presently appeared to urge the same request,\r\nobserving that a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew.\r\nWithout disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the Palmer\r\nthanked them for their courtesy, but observed that he had included in\r\nhis religious vow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on\r\nmatters which were prohibited in the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cThat vow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba to\r\nthe cupbearer, \xe2\x80\x9cwould scarce suit a serving-man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought to\r\nhave lodged him in the solere chamber,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut since he is so\r\nunsocial to Christians, e\xe2\x80\x99en let him take the next stall to Isaac the\r\nJew\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x94Anwold,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the torchbearer, \xe2\x80\x9ccarry the Pilgrim to the\r\nsouthern cell.\xe2\x80\x94I give you good-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Palmer, with\r\nsmall thanks for short courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, and Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s benison,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, with composure;\r\nand his guide moved forward.\r\n\r\nIn a small antechamber, into which several doors opened, and which was\r\nlighted by a small iron lamp, they met a second interruption from the\r\nwaiting-maid of Rowena, who, saying in a tone of authority, that her\r\nmistress desired to speak with the Palmer, took the torch from the hand\r\nof Anwold, and, bidding him await her return, made a sign to the Palmer\r\nto follow. Apparently he did not think it proper to decline this\r\ninvitation as he had done the former; for, though his gesture indicated\r\nsome surprise at the summons, he obeyed it without answer or\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\nA short passage, and an ascent of seven steps, each of which was\r\ncomposed of a solid beam of oak, led him to the apartment of the Lady\r\nRowena, the rude magnificence of which corresponded to the respect\r\nwhich was paid to her by the lord of the mansion. The walls were\r\ncovered with embroidered hangings, on which different-coloured silks,\r\ninterwoven with gold and silver threads, had been employed with all the\r\nart of which the age was capable, to represent the sports of hunting\r\nand hawking. The bed was adorned with the same rich tapestry, and\r\nsurrounded with curtains dyed with purple. The seats had also their\r\nstained coverings, and one, which was higher than the rest, was\r\naccommodated with a footstool of ivory, curiously carved.\r\n\r\nNo fewer than four silver candelabras, holding great waxen torches,\r\nserved to illuminate this apartment. Yet let not modern beauty envy the\r\nmagnificence of a Saxon princess. The walls of the apartment were so\r\nill finished and so full of crevices, that the rich hangings shook in\r\nthe night blast, and, in despite of a sort of screen intended to\r\nprotect them from the wind, the flame of the torches streamed sideways\r\ninto the air, like the unfurled pennon of a chieftain. Magnificence\r\nthere was, with some rude attempt at taste; but of comfort there was\r\nlittle, and, being unknown, it was unmissed.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Rowena, with three of her attendants standing at her back, and\r\narranging her hair ere she lay down to rest, was seated in the sort of\r\nthrone already mentioned, and looked as if born to exact general\r\nhomage. The Pilgrim acknowledged her claim to it by a low genuflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, Palmer,\xe2\x80\x9d said she graciously. \xe2\x80\x9cThe defender of the absent has a\r\nright to favourable reception from all who value truth, and honour\r\nmanhood.\xe2\x80\x9d She then said to her train, \xe2\x80\x9cRetire, excepting only Elgitha;\r\nI would speak with this holy Pilgrim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maidens, without leaving the apartment, retired to its further\r\nextremity, and sat down on a small bench against the wall, where they\r\nremained mute as statues, though at such a distance that their whispers\r\ncould not have interrupted the conversation of their mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPilgrim,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, during which she\r\nseemed uncertain how to address him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou this night mentioned a name\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a degree of effort, \xe2\x80\x9cthe name of Ivanhoe, in the\r\nhalls where by nature and kindred it should have sounded most\r\nacceptably; and yet, such is the perverse course of fate, that of many\r\nwhose hearts must have throbbed at the sound, I, only, dare ask you\r\nwhere, and in what condition, you left him of whom you spoke?\xe2\x80\x94We heard,\r\nthat, having remained in Palestine, on account of his impaired health,\r\nafter the departure of the English army, he had experienced the\r\npersecution of the French faction, to whom the Templars are known to be\r\nattached.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know little of the Knight of Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Palmer, with a\r\ntroubled voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI would I knew him better, since you, lady, are\r\ninterested in his fate. He hath, I believe, surmounted the persecution\r\nof his enemies in Palestine, and is on the eve of returning to England,\r\nwhere you, lady, must know better than I, what is his chance of\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Lady Rowena sighed deeply, and asked more particularly when the\r\nKnight of Ivanhoe might be expected in his native country, and whether\r\nhe would not be exposed to great dangers by the road. On the first\r\npoint, the Palmer professed ignorance; on the second, he said that the\r\nvoyage might be safely made by the way of Venice and Genoa, and from\r\nthence through France to England. \xe2\x80\x9cIvanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas so well\r\nacquainted with the language and manners of the French, that there was\r\nno fear of his incurring any hazard during that part of his travels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould to God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lady Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9che were here safely arrived, and\r\nable to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in which the chivalry of\r\nthis land are expected to display their address and valour. Should\r\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh obtain the prize, Ivanhoe is like to hear\r\nevil tidings when he reaches England.\xe2\x80\x94How looked he, stranger, when you\r\nlast saw him? Had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and\r\ncomeliness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was darker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cand thinner, than when he came from\r\nCyprus in the train of C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on\r\nhis brow; but I approached not his presence, because he is unknown to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear, find little in his native land to\r\nclear those clouds from his countenance. Thanks, good Pilgrim, for your\r\ninformation concerning the companion of my childhood.\xe2\x80\x94Maidens,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cdraw near\xe2\x80\x94offer the sleeping cup to this holy man, whom I will\r\nno longer detain from repose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich mixture of\r\nwine and spice, which Rowena barely put to her lips. It was then\r\noffered to the Palmer, who, after a low obeisance, tasted a few drops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept this alms, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the lady, offering a piece of\r\ngold, \xe2\x80\x9cin acknowledgment of thy painful travail, and of the shrines\r\nthou hast visited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Palmer received the boon with another low reverence, and followed\r\nEdwina out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nIn the anteroom he found his attendant Anwold, who, taking the torch\r\nfrom the hand of the waiting-maid, conducted him with more haste than\r\nceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a\r\nnumber of small apartments, or rather cells, served for sleeping places\r\nto the lower order of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn which of these sleeps the Jew?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unbelieving dog,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anwold, \xe2\x80\x9ckennels in the cell next your\r\nholiness.\xe2\x80\x94St Dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be\r\nagain fit for a Christian!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where sleeps Gurth the swineherd?\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGurth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the bondsman, \xe2\x80\x9csleeps in the cell on your right, as\r\nthe Jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of\r\ncircumcision separate from the abomination of his tribe. You might have\r\noccupied a more honourable place had you accepted of Oswald\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as well as it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer; \xe2\x80\x9cthe company, even of a Jew,\r\ncan hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he entered the cabin allotted to him, and taking the torch\r\nfrom the domestic\xe2\x80\x99s hand, thanked him, and wished him good-night.\r\nHaving shut the door of his cell, he placed the torch in a candlestick\r\nmade of wood, and looked around his sleeping apartment, the furniture\r\nof which was of the most simple kind. It consisted of a rude wooden\r\nstool, and still ruder hutch or bed-frame, stuffed with clean straw,\r\nand accommodated with two or three sheepskins by way of bed-clothes.\r\n\r\nThe Palmer, having extinguished his torch, threw himself, without\r\ntaking off any part of his clothes, on this rude couch, and slept, or\r\nat least retained his recumbent posture, till the earliest sunbeams\r\nfound their way through the little grated window, which served at once\r\nto admit both air and light to his uncomfortable cell. He then started\r\nup, and after repeating his matins, and adjusting his dress, he left\r\nit, and entered that of Isaac the Jew, lifting the latch as gently as\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\nThe inmate was lying in troubled slumber upon a couch similar to that\r\non which the Palmer himself had passed the night. Such parts of his\r\ndress as the Jew had laid aside on the preceding evening, were disposed\r\ncarefully around his person, as if to prevent the hazard of their being\r\ncarried off during his slumbers. There was a trouble on his brow\r\namounting almost to agony. His hands and arms moved convulsively, as if\r\nstruggling with the nightmare; and besides several ejaculations in\r\nHebrew, the following were distinctly heard in the Norman-English, or\r\nmixed language of the country: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of the God of Abraham,\r\nspare an unhappy old man! I am poor, I am penniless\xe2\x80\x94should your irons\r\nwrench my limbs asunder, I could not gratify you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Palmer awaited not the end of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s vision, but stirred him\r\nwith his pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s staff. The touch probably associated, as is usual,\r\nwith some of the apprehensions excited by his dream; for the old man\r\nstarted up, his grey hair standing almost erect upon his head, and\r\nhuddling some part of his garments about him, while he held the\r\ndetached pieces with the tenacious grasp of a falcon, he fixed upon the\r\nPalmer his keen black eyes, expressive of wild surprise and of bodily\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing from me, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cI come as your\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe God of Israel requite you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, greatly relieved; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndreamed\xe2\x80\x94But Father Abraham be praised, it was but a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d Then,\r\ncollecting himself, he added in his usual tone, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what may it be\r\nyour pleasure to want at so early an hour with the poor Jew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you leave not this\r\nmansion instantly, and travel not with some haste, your journey may\r\nprove a dangerous one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly father!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cwhom could it interest to endanger so\r\npoor a wretch as I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose you can best guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim; \xe2\x80\x9cbut rely on this,\r\nthat when the Templar crossed the hall yesternight, he spoke to his\r\nMussulman slaves in the Saracen language, which I well understand, and\r\ncharged them this morning to watch the journey of the Jew, to seize\r\nupon him when at a convenient distance from the mansion, and to conduct\r\nhim to the castle of Philip de Malvoisin, or to that of Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the extremity of terror which seized upon\r\nthe Jew at this information, and seemed at once to overpower his whole\r\nfaculties. His arms fell down to his sides, and his head drooped on his\r\nbreast, his knees bent under his weight, every nerve and muscle of his\r\nframe seemed to collapse and lose its energy, and he sunk at the foot\r\nof the Palmer, not in the fashion of one who intentionally stoops,\r\nkneels, or prostrates himself to excite compassion, but like a man\r\nborne down on all sides by the pressure of some invisible force, which\r\ncrushes him to the earth without the power of resistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly God of Abraham!\xe2\x80\x9d was his first exclamation, folding and elevating\r\nhis wrinkled hands, but without raising his grey head from the\r\npavement; \xe2\x80\x9cOh, holy Moses! O, blessed Aaron! the dream is not dreamed\r\nfor nought, and the vision cometh not in vain! I feel their irons\r\nalready tear my sinews! I feel the rack pass over my body like the\r\nsaws, and harrows, and axes of iron over the men of Rabbah, and of the\r\ncities of the children of Ammon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand up, Isaac, and hearken to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, who viewed the\r\nextremity of his distress with a compassion in which contempt was\r\nlargely mingled; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have cause for your terror, considering how your\r\nbrethren have been used, in order to extort from them their hoards,\r\nboth by princes and nobles; but stand up, I say, and I will point out\r\nto you the means of escape. Leave this mansion instantly, while its\r\ninmates sleep sound after the last night\xe2\x80\x99s revel. I will guide you by\r\nthe secret paths of the forest, known as well to me as to any forester\r\nthat ranges it, and I will not leave you till you are under safe\r\nconduct of some chief or baron going to the tournament, whose good-will\r\nyou have probably the means of securing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the ears of Isaac received the hopes of escape which this speech\r\nintimated, he began gradually, and inch by inch, as it were, to raise\r\nhimself up from the ground, until he fairly rested upon his knees,\r\nthrowing back his long grey hair and beard, and fixing his keen black\r\neyes upon the Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s face, with a look expressive at once of hope and\r\nfear, not unmingled with suspicion. But when he heard the concluding\r\npart of the sentence, his original terror appeared to revive in full\r\nforce, and he dropt once more on his face, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ possess the\r\nmeans of securing good-will! alas! there is but one road to the favour\r\nof a Christian, and how can the poor Jew find it, whom extortions have\r\nalready reduced to the misery of Lazarus?\xe2\x80\x9d Then, as if suspicion had\r\noverpowered his other feelings, he suddenly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of\r\nGod, young man, betray me not\xe2\x80\x94for the sake of the Great Father who made\r\nus all, Jew as well as Gentile, Israelite and Ishmaelite\xe2\x80\x94do me no\r\ntreason! I have not means to secure the good-will of a Christian\r\nbeggar, were he rating it at a single penny.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke these last\r\nwords, he raised himself, and grasped the Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s mantle with a look\r\nof the most earnest entreaty. The pilgrim extricated himself, as if\r\nthere were contamination in the touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWert thou loaded with all the wealth of thy tribe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ninterest have I to injure thee?\xe2\x80\x94In this dress I am vowed to poverty,\r\nnor do I change it for aught save a horse and a coat of mail. Yet think\r\nnot that I care for thy company, or propose myself advantage by it;\r\nremain here if thou wilt\xe2\x80\x94Cedric the Saxon may protect thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9che will not let me travel in his train\xe2\x80\x94Saxon or\r\nNorman will be equally ashamed of the poor Israelite; and to travel by\r\nmyself through the domains of Philip de Malvoisin and Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x94Good youth, I will go with you!\xe2\x80\x94Let us haste\xe2\x80\x94let us gird\r\nup our loins\xe2\x80\x94let us flee!\xe2\x80\x94Here is thy staff, why wilt thou tarry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tarry not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his\r\ncompanion; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must secure the means of leaving this place\xe2\x80\x94follow\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised,\r\nwas occupied by Gurth the swineherd.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cArise, Gurth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9carise quickly. Undo the postern gate, and let out the Jew and me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much\r\nconsequence in Saxon England as that of Eumaeus in Ithaca, was offended\r\nat the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the Palmer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jew\r\nleaving Rotherwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking\r\nsuperciliously at him without quitting his pallet, \xe2\x80\x9cand travelling in\r\ncompany with the Palmer to boot\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should as soon have dreamt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, who entered the apartment\r\nat the instant, \xe2\x80\x9cof his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden\r\nlog which served him for a pillow, \xe2\x80\x9cboth Jew and Gentile must be\r\ncontent to abide the opening of the great gate\xe2\x80\x94we suffer no visitors to\r\ndepart by stealth at these unseasonable hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim, in a commanding tone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will not,\r\nI think, refuse me that favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and\r\nwhispered something in his ear in Saxon. Gurth started up as if\r\nelectrified. The Pilgrim, raising his finger in an attitude as if to\r\nexpress caution, added, \xe2\x80\x9cGurth, beware\xe2\x80\x94thou are wont to be prudent. I\r\nsay, undo the postern\xe2\x80\x94thou shalt know more anon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith hasty alacrity Gurth obeyed him, while Wamba and the Jew followed,\r\nboth wondering at the sudden change in the swineherd\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nmule, my mule!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, as soon as they stood without the\r\npostern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch him his mule,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim; \xe2\x80\x9cand, hearest thou,\xe2\x80\x94let me have\r\nanother, that I may bear him company till he is beyond these parts\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill return it safely to some of Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s train at Ashby. And do\r\nthou\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he whispered the rest in Gurth\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly, most willingly shall it be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, and instantly\r\ndeparted to execute the commission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, when his comrade\xe2\x80\x99s back was turned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nyou Palmers learn in the Holy Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo say our orisons, fool,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Pilgrim, \xe2\x80\x9cto repent our sins,\r\nand to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething more potent than that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9cfor when would\r\nrepentance or prayer make Gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil\r\npersuade him to lend you a mule?\xe2\x80\x94I trow you might as well have told his\r\nfavourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have gotten\r\nas civil an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art but a Saxon fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayst well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9chad I been born a Norman, as I\r\nthink thou art, I would have had luck on my side, and been next door to\r\na wise man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with the\r\nmules. The travellers crossed the ditch upon a drawbridge of only two\r\nplanks breadth, the narrowness of which was matched with the straitness\r\nof the postern, and with a little wicket in the exterior palisade,\r\nwhich gave access to the forest. No sooner had they reached the mules,\r\nthan the Jew, with hasty and trembling hands, secured behind the saddle\r\na small bag of blue buckram, which he took from under his cloak,\r\ncontaining, as he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9ca change of raiment\xe2\x80\x94only a change of\r\nraiment.\xe2\x80\x9d Then getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste\r\nthan could have been anticipated from his years, he lost no time in so\r\ndisposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal completely from\r\nobservation the burden which he had thus deposited \xe2\x80\x9cen croupe\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed,\r\nhis hand to Gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration.\r\nThe swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost\r\nunder the boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his\r\nreverie by the voice of Wamba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowest thou,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cmy good friend Gurth, that thou art\r\nstrangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? I\r\nwould I were a black Prior or a barefoot Palmer, to avail myself of thy\r\nunwonted zeal and courtesy\xe2\x80\x94certes, I would make more out of it than a\r\nkiss of the hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art no fool thus far, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cthough thou\r\narguest from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more\xe2\x80\x94But it is\r\ntime to look after my charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the Jester.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a\r\ndispatch which argued the extremity of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s fears, since persons\r\nat his age are seldom fond of rapid motion. The Palmer, to whom every\r\npath and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way\r\nthrough the most devious paths, and more than once excited anew the\r\nsuspicion of the Israelite, that he intended to betray him into some\r\nambuscade of his enemies.\r\n\r\nHis doubts might have been indeed pardoned; for, except perhaps the\r\nflying fish, there was no race existing on the earth, in the air, or\r\nthe waters, who were the object of such an unintermitting, general, and\r\nrelentless persecution as the Jews of this period. Upon the slightest\r\nand most unreasonable pretences, as well as upon accusations the most\r\nabsurd and groundless, their persons and property were exposed to every\r\nturn of popular fury; for Norman, Saxon, Dane, and Briton, however\r\nadverse these races were to each other, contended which should look\r\nwith greatest detestation upon a people, whom it was accounted a point\r\nof religion to hate, to revile, to despise, to plunder, and to\r\npersecute. The kings of the Norman race, and the independent nobles,\r\nwho followed their example in all acts of tyranny, maintained against\r\nthis devoted people a persecution of a more regular, calculated, and\r\nself-interested kind. It is a well-known story of King John, that he\r\nconfined a wealthy Jew in one of the royal castles, and daily caused\r\none of his teeth to be torn out, until, when the jaw of the unhappy\r\nIsraelite was half disfurnished, he consented to pay a large sum, which\r\nit was the tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s object to extort from him. The little ready money\r\nwhich was in the country was chiefly in possession of this persecuted\r\npeople, and the nobility hesitated not to follow the example of their\r\nsovereign, in wringing it from them by every species of oppression, and\r\neven personal torture. Yet the passive courage inspired by the love of\r\ngain, induced the Jews to dare the various evils to which they were\r\nsubjected, in consideration of the immense profits which they were\r\nenabled to realize in a country naturally so wealthy as England. In\r\nspite of every kind of discouragement, and even of the special court of\r\ntaxations already mentioned, called the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 Exchequer, erected for\r\nthe very purpose of despoiling and distressing them, the Jews\r\nincreased, multiplied, and accumulated huge sums, which they\r\ntransferred from one hand to another by means of bills of exchange\xe2\x80\x94an\r\ninvention for which commerce is said to be indebted to them, and which\r\nenabled them to transfer their wealth from land to land, that when\r\nthreatened with oppression in one country, their treasure might be\r\nsecured in another.\r\n\r\nThe obstinacy and avarice of the Jews being thus in a measure placed in\r\nopposition to the fanaticism that tyranny of those under whom they\r\nlived, seemed to increase in proportion to the persecution with which\r\nthey were visited; and the immense wealth they usually acquired in\r\ncommerce, while it frequently placed them in danger, was at other times\r\nused to extend their influence, and to secure to them a certain degree\r\nof protection. On these terms they lived; and their character,\r\ninfluenced accordingly, was watchful, suspicious, and timid\xe2\x80\x94yet\r\nobstinate, uncomplying, and skilful in evading the dangers to which\r\nthey were exposed.\r\n\r\nWhen the travellers had pushed on at a rapid rate through many devious\r\npaths, the Palmer at length broke silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat large decayed oak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmarks the boundaries over which\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf claims authority\xe2\x80\x94we are long since far from those of\r\nMalvoisin. There is now no fear of pursuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the wheels of their chariots be taken off,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9clike\r\nthose of the host of Pharaoh, that they may drive heavily!\xe2\x80\x94But leave me\r\nnot, good Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x94Think but of that fierce and savage Templar, with his\r\nSaracen slaves\xe2\x80\x94they will regard neither territory, nor manor, nor\r\nlordship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur road,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cshould here separate; for it beseems not\r\nmen of my character and thine to travel together longer than needs must\r\nbe. Besides, what succour couldst thou have from me, a peaceful\r\nPilgrim, against two armed heathens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO good youth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthou canst defend me, and I know\r\nthou wouldst. Poor as I am, I will requite it\xe2\x80\x94not with money, for\r\nmoney, so help me my Father Abraham, I have none\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney and recompense,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nalready said I require not of thee. Guide thee I can; and, it may be,\r\neven in some sort defend thee; since to protect a Jew against a\r\nSaracen, can scarce be accounted unworthy of a Christian. Therefore,\r\nJew, I will see thee safe under some fitting escort. We are now not far\r\nfrom the town of Sheffield, where thou mayest easily find many of thy\r\ntribe with whom to take refuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blessing of Jacob be upon thee, good youth!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nSheffield I can harbour with my kinsman Zareth, and find some means of\r\ntravelling forth with safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer; \xe2\x80\x9cat Sheffield then we part, and\r\nhalf-an-hour\xe2\x80\x99s riding will bring us in sight of that town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe half hour was spent in perfect silence on both parts; the Pilgrim\r\nperhaps disdaining to address the Jew, except in case of absolute\r\nnecessity, and the Jew not presuming to force a conversation with a\r\nperson whose journey to the Holy Sepulchre gave a sort of sanctity to\r\nhis character. They paused on the top of a gently rising bank, and the\r\nPilgrim, pointing to the town of Sheffield, which lay beneath them,\r\nrepeated the words, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, then, we part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till you have had the poor Jew\xe2\x80\x99s thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\r\npresume not to ask you to go with me to my kinsman Zareth\xe2\x80\x99s, who might\r\naid me with some means of repaying your good offices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already said,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Pilgrim, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I desire no\r\nrecompense. If among the huge list of thy debtors, thou wilt, for my\r\nsake, spare the gyves and the dungeon to some unhappy Christian who\r\nstands in thy danger, I shall hold this morning\xe2\x80\x99s service to thee well\r\nbestowed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, laying hold of his garment; \xe2\x80\x9csomething\r\nwould I do more than this, something for thyself.\xe2\x80\x94God knows the Jew is\r\npoor\xe2\x80\x94yes, Isaac is the beggar of his tribe\xe2\x80\x94but forgive me should I\r\nguess what thou most lackest at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou wert to guess truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is what thou canst\r\nnot supply, wert thou as wealthy as thou sayst thou art poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I say?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cO! believe it, I say but the truth; I am a\r\nplundered, indebted, distressed man. Hard hands have wrung from me my\r\ngoods, my money, my ships, and all that I possessed\xe2\x80\x94Yet I can tell thee\r\nwhat thou lackest, and, it may be, supply it too. Thy wish even now is\r\nfor a horse and armour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Palmer started, and turned suddenly towards the Jew:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fiend\r\nprompted that guess?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cso that it be a true one\xe2\x80\x94and, as I\r\ncan guess thy want, so I can supply it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut consider,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, \xe2\x80\x9cmy character, my dress, my vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you Christians,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cand that the noblest of you\r\nwill take the staff and sandal in superstitious penance, and walk afoot\r\nto visit the graves of dead men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlaspheme not, Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke rashly. But there dropt words from\r\nyou last night and this morning, that, like sparks from flint, showed\r\nthe metal within; and in the bosom of that Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s gown, is hidden a\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s chain and spurs of gold. They glanced as you stooped over my\r\nbed in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrim could not forbear smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWere thy garments searched by\r\nas curious an eye, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat discoveries might not be\r\nmade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, changing colour; and drawing forth his\r\nwriting materials in haste, as if to stop the conversation, he began to\r\nwrite upon a piece of paper which he supported on the top of his yellow\r\ncap, without dismounting from his mule. When he had finished, he\r\ndelivered the scroll, which was in the Hebrew character, to the\r\nPilgrim, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the town of Leicester all men know the rich Jew,\r\nKirjath Jairam of Lombardy; give him this scroll\xe2\x80\x94he hath on sale six\r\nMilan harnesses, the worst would suit a crowned head\xe2\x80\x94ten goodly steeds,\r\nthe worst might mount a king, were he to do battle for his throne. Of\r\nthese he will give thee thy choice, with every thing else that can\r\nfurnish thee forth for the tournament: when it is over, thou wilt\r\nreturn them safely\xe2\x80\x94unless thou shouldst have wherewith to pay their\r\nvalue to the owner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Pilgrim, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou know that in these\r\nsports, the arms and steed of the knight who is unhorsed are forfeit to\r\nhis victor? Now I may be unfortunate, and so lose what I cannot replace\r\nor repay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew looked somewhat astounded at this possibility; but collecting\r\nhis courage, he replied hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94It is impossible\xe2\x80\x94I will not\r\nthink so. The blessing of Our Father will be upon thee. Thy lance will\r\nbe powerful as the rod of Moses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he was turning his mule\xe2\x80\x99s head away, when the Palmer, in his\r\nturn, took hold of his gaberdine. \xe2\x80\x9cNay, but Isaac, thou knowest not all\r\nthe risk. The steed may be slain, the armour injured\xe2\x80\x94for I will spare\r\nneither horse nor man. Besides, those of thy tribe give nothing for\r\nnothing; something there must be paid for their use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew twisted himself in the saddle, like a man in a fit of the\r\ncolic; but his better feelings predominated over those which were most\r\nfamiliar to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI care not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI care not\xe2\x80\x94let me go. If there\r\nis damage, it will cost you nothing\xe2\x80\x94if there is usage money, Kirjath\r\nJairam will forgive it for the sake of his kinsman Isaac. Fare thee\r\nwell!\xe2\x80\x94Yet hark thee, good youth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning about, \xe2\x80\x9cthrust\r\nthyself not too forward into this vain hurly-burly\xe2\x80\x94I speak not for\r\nendangering the steed, and coat of armour, but for the sake of thine\r\nown life and limbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy for thy caution,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Palmer, again smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cI will use\r\nthy courtesy frankly, and it will go hard with me but I will requite\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey parted, and took different roads for the town of Sheffield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nKnights, with a long retinue of their squires,\r\nIn gaudy liveries march and quaint attires;\r\nOne laced the helm, another held the lance,\r\nA third the shining buckler did advance.\r\nThe courser paw\xe2\x80\x99d the ground with restless feet,\r\nAnd snorting foam\xe2\x80\x99d and champ\xe2\x80\x99d the golden bit.\r\nThe smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,\r\nFiles in their hands, and hammers at their side;\r\nAnd nails for loosen\xe2\x80\x99d spears, and thongs for shields provide.\r\nThe yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands;\r\nAnd clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAMON AND ARCITE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the English nation was at this time sufficiently\r\nmiserable. King Richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of the\r\nperfidious and cruel Duke of Austria. Even the very place of his\r\ncaptivity was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly known to the\r\ngenerality of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every\r\nspecies of subaltern oppression.\r\n\r\nPrince John, in league with Philip of France, C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion\xe2\x80\x99s mortal\r\nenemy, was using every species of influence with the Duke of Austria,\r\nto prolong the captivity of his brother Richard, to whom he stood\r\nindebted for so many favours. In the meantime, he was strengthening his\r\nown faction in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the\r\nsuccession, in case of the King\xe2\x80\x99s death, with the legitimate heir,\r\nArthur Duke of Brittany, son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, the elder brother\r\nof John. This usurpation, it is well known, he afterwards effected. His\r\nown character being light, profligate, and perfidious, John easily\r\nattached to his person and faction, not only all who had reason to\r\ndread the resentment of Richard for criminal proceedings during his\r\nabsence, but also the numerous class of \xe2\x80\x9clawless resolutes,\xe2\x80\x9d whom the\r\ncrusades had turned back on their country, accomplished in the vices of\r\nthe East, impoverished in substance, and hardened in character, and who\r\nplaced their hopes of harvest in civil commotion. To these causes of\r\npublic distress and apprehension, must be added, the multitude of\r\noutlaws, who, driven to despair by the oppression of the feudal\r\nnobility, and the severe exercise of the forest laws, banded together\r\nin large gangs, and, keeping possession of the forests and the wastes,\r\nset at defiance the justice and magistracy of the country. The nobles\r\nthemselves, each fortified within his own castle, and playing the petty\r\nsovereign over his own dominions, were the leaders of bands scarce less\r\nlawless and oppressive than those of the avowed depredators. To\r\nmaintain these retainers, and to support the extravagance and\r\nmagnificence which their pride induced them to affect, the nobility\r\nborrowed sums of money from the Jews at the most usurious interest,\r\nwhich gnawed into their estates like consuming cankers, scarce to be\r\ncured unless when circumstances gave them an opportunity of getting\r\nfree, by exercising upon their creditors some act of unprincipled\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nUnder the various burdens imposed by this unhappy state of affairs, the\r\npeople of England suffered deeply for the present, and had yet more\r\ndreadful cause to fear for the future. To augment their misery, a\r\ncontagious disorder of a dangerous nature spread through the land; and,\r\nrendered more virulent by the uncleanness, the indifferent food, and\r\nthe wretched lodging of the lower classes, swept off many whose fate\r\nthe survivors were tempted to envy, as exempting them from the evils\r\nwhich were to come.\r\n\r\nYet amid these accumulated distresses, the poor as well as the rich,\r\nthe vulgar as well as the noble, in the event of a tournament, which\r\nwas the grand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the\r\nhalf-starved citizen of Madrid, who has not a real left to buy\r\nprovisions for his family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. Neither\r\nduty nor infirmity could keep youth or age from such exhibitions. The\r\nPassage of Arms, as it was called, which was to take place at Ashby, in\r\nthe county of Leicester, as champions of the first renown were to take\r\nthe field in the presence of Prince John himself, who was expected to\r\ngrace the lists, had attracted universal attention, and an immense\r\nconfluence of persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning\r\nto the place of combat.\r\n\r\nThe scene was singularly romantic. On the verge of a wood, which\r\napproached to within a mile of the town of Ashby, was an extensive\r\nmeadow, of the finest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one\r\nside by the forest, and fringed on the other by straggling oak-trees,\r\nsome of which had grown to an immense size. The ground, as if fashioned\r\non purpose for the martial display which was intended, sloped gradually\r\ndown on all sides to a level bottom, which was enclosed for the lists\r\nwith strong palisades, forming a space of a quarter of a mile in\r\nlength, and about half as broad. The form of the enclosure was an\r\noblong square, save that the corners were considerably rounded off, in\r\norder to afford more convenience for the spectators. The openings for\r\nthe entry of the combatants were at the northern and southern\r\nextremities of the lists, accessible by strong wooden gates, each wide\r\nenough to admit two horsemen riding abreast. At each of these portals\r\nwere stationed two heralds, attended by six trumpets, as many\r\npursuivants, and a strong body of men-at-arms for maintaining order,\r\nand ascertaining the quality of the knights who proposed to engage in\r\nthis martial game.\r\n\r\nOn a platform beyond the southern entrance, formed by a natural\r\nelevation of the ground, were pitched five magnificent pavilions,\r\nadorned with pennons of russet and black, the chosen colours of the\r\nfive knights challengers. The cords of the tents were of the same\r\ncolour. Before each pavilion was suspended the shield of the knight by\r\nwhom it was occupied, and beside it stood his squire, quaintly\r\ndisguised as a salvage or silvan man, or in some other fantastic dress,\r\naccording to the taste of his master, and the character he was pleased\r\nto assume during the game. 16\r\n\r\nThe central pavilion, as the place of honour, had been assigned to\r\nBrian be Bois-Guilbert, whose renown in all games of chivalry, no less\r\nthan his connexions with the knights who had undertaken this Passage of\r\nArms, had occasioned him to be eagerly received into the company of the\r\nchallengers, and even adopted as their chief and leader, though he had\r\nso recently joined them. On one side of his tent were pitched those of\r\nReginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and Richard de Malvoisin, and on the other was\r\nthe pavilion of Hugh de Grantmesnil, a noble baron in the vicinity,\r\nwhose ancestor had been Lord High Steward of England in the time of the\r\nConqueror, and his son William Rufus. Ralph de Vipont, a knight of St\r\nJohn of Jerusalem, who had some ancient possessions at a place called\r\nHeather, near Ashby-de-la-Zouche, occupied the fifth pavilion. From the\r\nentrance into the lists, a gently sloping passage, ten yards in\r\nbreadth, led up to the platform on which the tents were pitched. It was\r\nstrongly secured by a palisade on each side, as was the esplanade in\r\nfront of the pavilions, and the whole was guarded by men-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe northern access to the lists terminated in a similar entrance of\r\nthirty feet in breadth, at the extremity of which was a large enclosed\r\nspace for such knights as might be disposed to enter the lists with the\r\nchallengers, behind which were placed tents containing refreshments of\r\nevery kind for their accommodation, with armourers, tarriers, and other\r\nattendants, in readiness to give their services wherever they might be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the lists was in part occupied by temporary galleries,\r\nspread with tapestry and carpets, and accommodated with cushions for\r\nthe convenience of those ladies and nobles who were expected to attend\r\nthe tournament. A narrow space, betwixt these galleries and the lists,\r\ngave accommodation for yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than\r\nthe mere vulgar, and might be compared to the pit of a theatre. The\r\npromiscuous multitude arranged themselves upon large banks of turf\r\nprepared for the purpose, which, aided by the natural elevation of the\r\nground, enabled them to overlook the galleries, and obtain a fair view\r\ninto the lists. Besides the accommodation which these stations\r\nafforded, many hundreds had perched themselves on the branches of the\r\ntrees which surrounded the meadow; and even the steeple of a country\r\nchurch, at some distance, was crowded with spectators.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that one\r\ngallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and\r\nconsequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat\r\nwas to take place, was raised higher than the others, more richly\r\ndecorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the\r\nroyal arms were emblazoned. Squires, pages, and yeomen in rich\r\nliveries, waited around this place of honour, which was designed for\r\nPrince John and his attendants. Opposite to this royal gallery was\r\nanother, elevated to the same height, on the western side of the lists;\r\nand more gaily, if less sumptuously decorated, than that destined for\r\nthe Prince himself. A train of pages and of young maidens, the most\r\nbeautiful who could be selected, gaily dressed in fancy habits of green\r\nand pink, surrounded a throne decorated in the same colours. Among\r\npennons and flags bearing wounded hearts, burning hearts, bleeding\r\nhearts, bows and quivers, and all the commonplace emblems of the\r\ntriumphs of Cupid, a blazoned inscription informed the spectators, that\r\nthis seat of honour was designed for \xe2\x80\x9cLa Royne de las Beaulte et des\r\nAmours\xe2\x80\x9d. But who was to represent the Queen of Beauty and of Love on\r\nthe present occasion no one was prepared to guess.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, spectators of every description thronged forward to occupy\r\ntheir respective stations, and not without many quarrels concerning\r\nthose which they were entitled to hold. Some of these were settled by\r\nthe men-at-arms with brief ceremony; the shafts of their battle-axes,\r\nand pummels of their swords, being readily employed as arguments to\r\nconvince the more refractory. Others, which involved the rival claims\r\nof more elevated persons, were determined by the heralds, or by the two\r\nmarshals of the field, William de Wyvil, and Stephen de Martival, who,\r\narmed at all points, rode up and down the lists to enforce and preserve\r\ngood order among the spectators.\r\n\r\nGradually the galleries became filled with knights and nobles, in their\r\nrobes of peace, whose long and rich-tinted mantles were contrasted with\r\nthe gayer and more splendid habits of the ladies, who, in a greater\r\nproportion than even the men themselves, thronged to witness a sport,\r\nwhich one would have thought too bloody and dangerous to afford their\r\nsex much pleasure. The lower and interior space was soon filled by\r\nsubstantial yeomen and burghers, and such of the lesser gentry, as,\r\nfrom modesty, poverty, or dubious title, durst not assume any higher\r\nplace. It was of course amongst these that the most frequent disputes\r\nfor precedence occurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDog of an unbeliever,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old man, whose threadbare tunic bore\r\nwitness to his poverty, as his sword, and dagger, and golden chain\r\nintimated his pretensions to rank,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhelp of a she-wolf! darest thou\r\npress upon a Christian, and a Norman gentleman of the blood of\r\nMontdidier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis rough expostulation was addressed to no other than our\r\nacquaintance Isaac, who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a\r\ngaberdine ornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to\r\nmake place in the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter,\r\nthe beautiful Rebecca, who had joined him at Ashby, and who was now\r\nhanging on her father\xe2\x80\x99s arm, not a little terrified by the popular\r\ndispleasure which seemed generally excited by her parent\xe2\x80\x99s presumption.\r\nBut Isaac, though we have seen him sufficiently timid on other\r\noccasions, knew well that at present he had nothing to fear. It was not\r\nin places of general resort, or where their equals were assembled, that\r\nany avaricious or malevolent noble durst offer him injury. At such\r\nmeetings the Jews were under the protection of the general law; and if\r\nthat proved a weak assurance, it usually happened that there were among\r\nthe persons assembled some barons, who, for their own interested\r\nmotives, were ready to act as their protectors. On the present\r\noccasion, Isaac felt more than usually confident, being aware that\r\nPrince John was even then in the very act of negotiating a large loan\r\nfrom the Jews of York, to be secured upon certain jewels and lands.\r\nIsaac\xe2\x80\x99s own share in this transaction was considerable, and he well\r\nknew that the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s eager desire to bring it to a conclusion would\r\nensure him his protection in the dilemma in which he stood.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by these considerations, the Jew pursued his point, and\r\njostled the Norman Christian, without respect either to his descent,\r\nquality, or religion. The complaints of the old man, however, excited\r\nthe indignation of the bystanders. One of these, a stout well-set\r\nyeoman, arrayed in Lincoln green, having twelve arrows stuck in his\r\nbelt, with a baldric and badge of silver, and a bow of six feet length\r\nin his hand, turned short round, and while his countenance, which his\r\nconstant exposure to weather had rendered brown as a hazel nut, grew\r\ndarker with anger, he advised the Jew to remember that all the wealth\r\nhe had acquired by sucking the blood of his miserable victims had but\r\nswelled him like a bloated spider, which might be overlooked while he\r\nkept in a corner, but would be crushed if it ventured into the light.\r\nThis intimation, delivered in Norman-English with a firm voice and a\r\nstern aspect, made the Jew shrink back; and he would have probably\r\nwithdrawn himself altogether from a vicinity so dangerous, had not the\r\nattention of every one been called to the sudden entrance of Prince\r\nJohn, who at that moment entered the lists, attended by a numerous and\r\ngay train, consisting partly of laymen, partly of churchmen, as light\r\nin their dress, and as gay in their demeanour, as their companions.\r\nAmong the latter was the Prior of Jorvaulx, in the most gallant trim\r\nwhich a dignitary of the church could venture to exhibit. Fur and gold\r\nwere not spared in his garments; and the points of his boots,\r\nout-heroding the preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very\r\nfar, as to be attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very\r\ngirdle, and effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the\r\nstirrup. This, however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant\r\nAbbot, who, perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his\r\naccomplished horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the\r\nfair sex, dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider.\r\nThe rest of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of\r\nhis mercenary troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants\r\nupon the court, with several Knights Templars and Knights of St John.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were\r\naccounted hostile to King Richard, having adopted the side of Philip of\r\nFrance in the long train of disputes which took place in Palestine\r\nbetwixt that monarch and the lion-hearted King of England. It was the\r\nwell-known consequence of this discord that Richard\xe2\x80\x99s repeated\r\nvictories had been rendered fruitless, his romantic attempts to besiege\r\nJerusalem disappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had\r\nacquired had dwindled into an uncertain truce with the Sultan Saladin.\r\nWith the same policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren\r\nin the Holy Land, the Templars and Hospitallers in England and Normandy\r\nattached themselves to the faction of Prince John, having little reason\r\nto desire the return of Richard to England, or the succession of\r\nArthur, his legitimate heir. For the opposite reason, Prince John hated\r\nand contemned the few Saxon families of consequence which subsisted in\r\nEngland, and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them;\r\nbeing conscious that his person and pretensions were disliked by them,\r\nas well as by the greater part of the English commons, who feared\r\nfarther innovation upon their rights and liberties, from a sovereign of\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s licentious and tyrannical disposition.\r\n\r\nAttended by this gallant equipage, himself well mounted, and splendidly\r\ndressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and\r\nhaving his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of\r\nprecious stones, from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread\r\nhis shoulders, Prince John, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey,\r\ncaracoled within the lists at the head of his jovial party, laughing\r\nloud with his train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal\r\ncriticism the beauties who adorned the lofty galleries.\r\n\r\nThose who remarked in the physiognomy of the Prince a dissolute\r\naudacity, mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the\r\nfeelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of\r\ncomeliness which belongs to an open set of features, well formed by\r\nnature, modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far\r\nfrank and honest, that they seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the\r\nnatural workings of the soul. Such an expression is often mistaken for\r\nmanly frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference\r\nof a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of\r\nwealth, or of some other adventitious advantage, totally unconnected\r\nwith personal merit. To those who did not think so deeply, and they\r\nwere the greater number by a hundred to one, the splendour of Prince\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crheno\xe2\x80\x9d, (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined\r\nwith the most costly sables, his maroquin boots and golden spurs,\r\ntogether with the grace with which he managed his palfrey, were\r\nsufficient to merit clamorous applause.\r\n\r\nIn his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the Prince was\r\ncalled by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the\r\nambitious movement of Isaac towards the higher places of the assembly.\r\nThe quick eye of Prince John instantly recognised the Jew, but was much\r\nmore agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of Zion, who,\r\nterrified by the tumult, clung close to the arm of her aged father.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest\r\nbeauties of England, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a\r\nconnoisseur as Prince John. Her form was exquisitely symmetrical, and\r\nwas shown to advantage by a sort of Eastern dress, which she wore\r\naccording to the fashion of the females of her nation. Her turban of\r\nyellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. The\r\nbrilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her\r\nwell-formed aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the\r\nprofusion of her sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little\r\nspiral of twisted curls, fell down upon as much of a lovely neck and\r\nbosom as a simarre of the richest Persian silk, exhibiting flowers in\r\ntheir natural colours embossed upon a purple ground, permitted to be\r\nvisible\xe2\x80\x94all these constituted a combination of loveliness, which\r\nyielded not to the most beautiful of the maidens who surrounded her. It\r\nis true, that of the golden and pearl-studded clasps, which closed her\r\nvest from the throat to the waist, the three uppermost were left\r\nunfastened on account of the heat, which somewhat enlarged the prospect\r\nto which we allude. A diamond necklace, with pendants of inestimable\r\nvalue, were by this means also made more conspicuous. The feather of an\r\nostrich, fastened in her turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was\r\nanother distinction of the beautiful Jewess, scoffed and sneered at by\r\nthe proud dames who sat above her, but secretly envied by those who\r\naffected to deride them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the bald scalp of Abraham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cyonder Jewess must\r\nbe the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the\r\nwisest king that ever lived! What sayest thou, Prior Aymer?\xe2\x80\x94By the\r\nTemple of that wise king, which our wiser brother Richard proved unable\r\nto recover, she is the very Bride of the Canticles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Rose of Sharon and the Lily of the Valley,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94answered the Prior, in\r\na sort of snuffling tone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut your Grace must remember she is still\r\nbut a Jewess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d added Prince John, without heeding him, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is my Mammon\r\nof unrighteousness too\xe2\x80\x94the Marquis of Marks, the Baron of Byzants,\r\ncontesting for place with penniless dogs, whose threadbare cloaks have\r\nnot a single cross in their pouches to keep the devil from dancing\r\nthere. By the body of St Mark, my prince of supplies, with his lovely\r\nJewess, shall have a place in the gallery!\xe2\x80\x94What is she, Isaac? Thy wife\r\nor thy daughter, that Eastern houri that thou lockest under thy arm as\r\nthou wouldst thy treasure-casket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter Rebecca, so please your Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac, with a low\r\ncongee, nothing embarrassed by the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s salutation, in which,\r\nhowever, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wiser man thou,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, with a peal of laughter, in which his\r\ngay followers obsequiously joined. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, daughter or wife, she should\r\nbe preferred according to her beauty and thy merits.\xe2\x80\x94Who sits above\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, bending his eye on the gallery. \xe2\x80\x9cSaxon churls,\r\nlolling at their lazy length!\xe2\x80\x94out upon them!\xe2\x80\x94let them sit close, and\r\nmake room for my prince of usurers and his lovely daughter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make\r\nthe hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with\r\nthose whom the synagogue properly belongs to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite\r\nspeech was addressed, were the family of Cedric the Saxon, with that of\r\nhis ally and kinsman, Athelstane of Coningsburgh, a personage, who, on\r\naccount of his descent from the last Saxon monarchs of England, was\r\nheld in the highest respect by all the Saxon natives of the north of\r\nEngland. But with the blood of this ancient royal race, many of their\r\ninfirmities had descended to Athelstane. He was comely in countenance,\r\nbulky and strong in person, and in the flower of his age\xe2\x80\x94yet inanimate\r\nin expression, dull-eyed, heavy-browed, inactive and sluggish in all\r\nhis motions, and so slow in resolution, that the soubriquet of one of\r\nhis ancestors was conferred upon him, and he was very generally called\r\nAthelstane the Unready. His friends, and he had many, who, as well as\r\nCedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish\r\ntemper arose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision;\r\nothers alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his\r\nfaculties, never of a very acute order, and that the passive courage\r\nand meek good-nature which remained behind, were merely the dregs of a\r\ncharacter that might have been deserving of praise, but of which all\r\nthe valuable parts had flown off in the progress of a long course of\r\nbrutal debauchery.\r\n\r\nIt was to this person, such as we have described him, that the Prince\r\naddressed his imperious command to make place for Isaac and Rebecca.\r\nAthelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and\r\nfeelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting, unwilling to\r\nobey, yet undetermined how to resist, opposed only the \xe2\x80\x9cvis inertiae\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto the will of John; and, without stirring or making any motion\r\nwhatever of obedience, opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the\r\nPrince with an astonishment which had in it something extremely\r\nludicrous. But the impatient John regarded it in no such light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Saxon porker,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis either asleep or minds me not\xe2\x80\x94Prick\r\nhim with your lance, De Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d speaking to a knight who rode near him,\r\nthe leader of a band of Free Companions, or Condottieri; that is, of\r\nmercenaries belonging to no particular nation, but attached for the\r\ntime to any prince by whom they were paid. There was a murmur even\r\namong the attendants of Prince John; but De Bracy, whose profession\r\nfreed him from all scruples, extended his long lance over the space\r\nwhich separated the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the\r\ncommands of the Prince before Athelstane the Unready had recovered\r\npresence of mind sufficient even to draw back his person from the\r\nweapon, had not Cedric, as prompt as his companion was tardy,\r\nunsheathed, with the speed of lightning, the short sword which he wore,\r\nand at a single blow severed the point of the lance from the handle.\r\nThe blood rushed into the countenance of Prince John. He swore one of\r\nhis deepest oaths, and was about to utter some threat corresponding in\r\nviolence, when he was diverted from his purpose, partly by his own\r\nattendants, who gathered around him conjuring him to be patient, partly\r\nby a general exclamation of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the\r\nspirited conduct of Cedric. The Prince rolled his eyes in indignation,\r\nas if to collect some safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter\r\nthe firm glance of the same archer whom we have already noticed, and\r\nwho seemed to persist in his gesture of applause, in spite of the\r\nfrowning aspect which the Prince bent upon him, he demanded his reason\r\nfor clamouring thus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always add my hollo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I see a good shot, or a\r\ngallant blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSayst thou?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cthen thou canst hit the white\r\nthyself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woodsman\xe2\x80\x99s mark, and at woodsman\xe2\x80\x99s distance, I can hit,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe yeoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Wat Tyrrel\xe2\x80\x99s mark, at a hundred yards,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from behind,\r\nbut by whom uttered could not be discerned.\r\n\r\nThis allusion to the fate of William Rufus, his Relative, at once\r\nincensed and alarmed Prince John. He satisfied himself, however, with\r\ncommanding the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on\r\nthe braggart, pointing to the yeoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St Grizzel,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will try his own skill, who is so ready\r\nto give his voice to the feats of others!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not fly the trial,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman, with the composure which\r\nmarked his whole deportment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, stand up, ye Saxon churls,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fiery Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, by\r\nthe light of Heaven, since I have said it, the Jew shall have his seat\r\namongst ye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, an it please your Grace!\xe2\x80\x94it is not fit for such as we to\r\nsit with the rulers of the land,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; whose ambition for\r\nprecedence though it had led him to dispute Place with the extenuated\r\nand impoverished descendant of the line of Montdidier, by no means\r\nstimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy\r\nSaxons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp, infidel dog when I command you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cor I will have\r\nthy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus urged, the Jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which\r\nled up to the gallery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cwho dare stop him,\xe2\x80\x9d fixing his eye on\r\nCedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the Jew down\r\nheadlong.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe was prevented by the clown Wamba, who, springing\r\nbetwixt his master and Isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndefiance, \xe2\x80\x9cMarry, that will I!\xe2\x80\x9d opposed to the beard of the Jew a\r\nshield of brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with\r\nwhich, doubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should\r\nhave proved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence. Finding\r\nthe abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the\r\nJester, at the same time, flourished his wooden sword above his head,\r\nthe Jew recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nexcellent jest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter, in which\r\nPrince John and his attendants heartily joined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeal me the prize, cousin Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cI have vanquished my\r\nfoe in fair fight with sword and shield,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, brandishing the\r\nbrawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, and what art thou, noble champion?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, still\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fool by right of descent,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9cI am Wamba, the son\r\nof Witless, who was the son of Weatherbrain, who was the son of an\r\nAlderman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake room for the Jew in front of the lower ring,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John,\r\nnot unwilling perhaps to seize an apology to desist from his original\r\npurpose; \xe2\x80\x9cto place the vanquished beside the victor were false\r\nheraldry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnave upon fool were worse,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cand Jew upon bacon\r\nworst of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy! good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cthou pleasest me\xe2\x80\x94Here,\r\nIsaac, lend me a handful of byzants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the Jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling to\r\ncomply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and was\r\nperhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a\r\nhandful, the Prince stooped from his jennet and settled Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s doubts\r\nby snatching the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to Wamba a\r\ncouple of the gold pieces which it contained, he pursued his career\r\nround the lists, leaving the Jew to the derision of those around him,\r\nand himself receiving as much applause from the spectators as if he had\r\ndone some honest and honourable action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this the challenger with fierce defy\r\nHis trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply:\r\nWith clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.\r\nTheir visors closed, their lances in the rest,\r\nOr at the helmet pointed or the crest,\r\nThey vanish from the barrier, speed the race,\r\nAnd spurring see decrease the middle space.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAMON AND ARCITE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and\r\nappealing to the Prior of Jorvaulx, declared the principal business of\r\nthe day had been forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my halidom,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have forgotten, Sir Prior, to name the\r\nfair Sovereign of Love and of Beauty, by whose white hand the palm is\r\nto be distributed. For my part, I am liberal in my ideas, and I care\r\nnot if I give my vote for the black-eyed Rebecca.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Virgin,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prior, turning up his eyes in horror, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nJewess!\xe2\x80\x94We should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and I am not\r\nyet old enough to be a martyr. Besides, I swear by my patron saint,\r\nthat she is far inferior to the lovely Saxon, Rowena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaxon or Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cSaxon or Jew, dog or hog, what\r\nmatters it? I say, name Rebecca, were it only to mortify the Saxon\r\nchurls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis passes a jest, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cno knight here will lay\r\nlance in rest if such an insult is attempted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mere wantonness of insult,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the oldest and most\r\nimportant of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s followers, Waldemar Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cand if your\r\nGrace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entertained you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, reining up his palfrey haughtily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor my follower, but not for my counsellor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who follow your Grace in the paths which you tread,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWaldemar, but speaking in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cacquire the right of\r\ncounsellors; for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged\r\nthan their own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the tone in which this was spoken, John saw the necessity of\r\nacquiescence. \xe2\x80\x9cI did but jest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you turn upon me like so\r\nmany adders! Name whom you will, in the fiend\xe2\x80\x99s name, and please\r\nyourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9clet the fair sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s throne remain\r\nunoccupied, until the conqueror shall be named, and then let him choose\r\nthe lady by whom it shall be filled. It will add another grace to his\r\ntriumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights,\r\nwho can exalt them to such distinction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Brian de Bois-Guilbert gain the prize,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ngage my rosary that I name the Sovereign of Love and Beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBois-Guilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cis a good lance; but there are\r\nothers around these lists, Sir Prior, who will not fear to encounter\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar, \xe2\x80\x9cand let the Prince assume his seat.\r\nThe knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and\r\nhighly fit it is that the sports should commence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John, though not yet a monarch, had in Waldemar Fitzurse all the\r\ninconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign,\r\nmust always do so in his own way. The Prince acquiesced, however,\r\nalthough his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be\r\nobstinate upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded\r\nby his followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of\r\nthe tournament, which were briefly as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.\r\n\r\nSecondly, any knight proposing to combat, might, if he pleased, select\r\na special antagonist from among the challengers, by touching his\r\nshield. If he did so with the reverse of his lance, the trial of skill\r\nwas made with what were called the arms of courtesy, that is, with\r\nlances at whose extremity a piece of round flat board was fixed, so\r\nthat no danger was encountered, save from the shock of the horses and\r\nriders. But if the shield was touched with the sharp end of the lance,\r\nthe combat was understood to be at \xe2\x80\x9coutrance\xe2\x80\x9d, that is, the knights\r\nwere to fight with sharp weapons, as in actual battle.\r\n\r\nThirdly, when the knights present had accomplished their vow, by each\r\nof them breaking five lances, the Prince was to declare the victor in\r\nthe first day\xe2\x80\x99s tourney, who should receive as prize a warhorse of\r\nexquisite beauty and matchless strength; and in addition to this reward\r\nof valour, it was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of\r\nnaming the Queen of Love and Beauty, by whom the prize should be given\r\non the ensuing day.\r\n\r\nFourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a\r\ngeneral tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous\r\nto win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of\r\nequal numbers, might fight it out manfully, until the signal was given\r\nby Prince John to cease the combat. The elected Queen of Love and\r\nBeauty was then to crown the knight whom the Prince should adjudge to\r\nhave borne himself best in this second day, with a coronet composed of\r\nthin gold plate, cut into the shape of a laurel crown. On this second\r\nday the knightly games ceased. But on that which was to follow, feats\r\nof archery, of bull-baiting, and other popular amusements, were to be\r\npractised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. In this\r\nmanner did Prince John endeavour to lay the foundation of a popularity,\r\nwhich he was perpetually throwing down by some inconsiderate act of\r\nwanton aggression upon the feelings and prejudices of the people.\r\n\r\nThe lists now presented a most splendid spectacle. The sloping\r\ngalleries were crowded with all that was noble, great, wealthy, and\r\nbeautiful in the northern and midland parts of England; and the\r\ncontrast of the various dresses of these dignified spectators, rendered\r\nthe view as gay as it was rich, while the interior and lower space,\r\nfilled with the substantial burgesses and yeomen of merry England,\r\nformed, in their more plain attire, a dark fringe, or border, around\r\nthis circle of brilliant embroidery, relieving, and, at the same time,\r\nsetting off its splendour.\r\n\r\nThe heralds finished their proclamation with their usual cry of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLargesse, largesse, gallant knights!\xe2\x80\x9d and gold and silver pieces were\r\nshowered on them from the galleries, it being a high point of chivalry\r\nto exhibit liberality towards those whom the age accounted at once the\r\nsecretaries and the historians of honour. The bounty of the spectators\r\nwas acknowledged by the customary shouts of \xe2\x80\x9cLove of Ladies\xe2\x80\x94Death of\r\nChampions\xe2\x80\x94Honour to the Generous\xe2\x80\x94Glory to the Brave!\xe2\x80\x9d To which the more\r\nhumble spectators added their acclamations, and a numerous band of\r\ntrumpeters the flourish of their martial instruments. When these sounds\r\nhad ceased, the heralds withdrew from the lists in gay and glittering\r\nprocession, and none remained within them save the marshals of the\r\nfield, who, armed cap-a-pie, sat on horseback, motionless as statues,\r\nat the opposite ends of the lists. Meantime, the enclosed space at the\r\nnorthern extremity of the lists, large as it was, was now completely\r\ncrowded with knights desirous to prove their skill against the\r\nchallengers, and, when viewed from the galleries, presented the\r\nappearance of a sea of waving plumage, intermixed with glistening\r\nhelmets, and tall lances, to the extremities of which were, in many\r\ncases, attached small pennons of about a span\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, which,\r\nfluttering in the air as the breeze caught them, joined with the\r\nrestless motion of the feathers to add liveliness to the scene.\r\n\r\nAt length the barriers were opened, and five knights, chosen by lot,\r\nadvanced slowly into the area; a single champion riding in front, and\r\nthe other four following in pairs. All were splendidly armed, and my\r\nSaxon authority (in the Wardour Manuscript) records at great length\r\ntheir devices, their colours, and the embroidery of their horse\r\ntrappings. It is unnecessary to be particular on these subjects. To\r\nborrow lines from a contemporary poet, who has written but too little:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe knights are dust,\r\nAnd their good swords are rust,\r\nTheir souls are with the saints, we trust.\xe2\x80\x9d 17\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir escutcheons have long mouldered from the walls of their castles.\r\nTheir castles themselves are but green mounds and shattered ruins\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nplace that once knew them, knows them no more\xe2\x80\x94nay, many a race since\r\ntheirs has died out and been forgotten in the very land which they\r\noccupied, with all the authority of feudal proprietors and feudal\r\nlords. What, then, would it avail the reader to know their names, or\r\nthe evanescent symbols of their martial rank!\r\n\r\nNow, however, no whit anticipating the oblivion which awaited their\r\nnames and feats, the champions advanced through the lists, restraining\r\ntheir fiery steeds, and compelling them to move slowly, while, at the\r\nsame time, they exhibited their paces, together with the grace and\r\ndexterity of the riders. As the procession entered the lists, the sound\r\nof a wild Barbaric music was heard from behind the tents of the\r\nchallengers, where the performers were concealed. It was of Eastern\r\norigin, having been brought from the Holy Land; and the mixture of the\r\ncymbals and bells seemed to bid welcome at once, and defiance, to the\r\nknights as they advanced. With the eyes of an immense concourse of\r\nspectators fixed upon them, the five knights advanced up the platform\r\nupon which the tents of the challengers stood, and there separating\r\nthemselves, each touched slightly, and with the reverse of his lance,\r\nthe shield of the antagonist to whom he wished to oppose himself. The\r\nlower orders of spectators in general\xe2\x80\x94nay, many of the higher class,\r\nand it is even said several of the ladies, were rather disappointed at\r\nthe champions choosing the arms of courtesy. For the same sort of\r\npersons, who, in the present day, applaud most highly the deepest\r\ntragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion\r\nto the danger incurred by the champions engaged.\r\n\r\nHaving intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated to\r\nthe extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line;\r\nwhile the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their\r\nhorses, and, headed by Brian de Bois-Guilbert, descended from the\r\nplatform, and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had\r\ntouched their respective shields.\r\n\r\nAt the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against each\r\nother at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or good\r\nfortune of the challengers, that those opposed to Bois-Guilbert,\r\nMalvoisin, and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, rolled on the ground. The antagonist of\r\nGrantmesnil, instead of bearing his lance-point fair against the crest\r\nor the shield of his enemy, swerved so much from the direct line as to\r\nbreak the weapon athwart the person of his opponent\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance\r\nwhich was accounted more disgraceful than that of being actually\r\nunhorsed; because the latter might happen from accident, whereas the\r\nformer evinced awkwardness and want of management of the weapon and of\r\nthe horse. The fifth knight alone maintained the honour of his party,\r\nand parted fairly with the Knight of St John, both splintering their\r\nlances without advantage on either side.\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the multitude, together with the acclamations of the\r\nheralds, and the clangour of the trumpets, announced the triumph of the\r\nvictors and the defeat of the vanquished. The former retreated to their\r\npavilions, and the latter, gathering themselves up as they could,\r\nwithdrew from the lists in disgrace and dejection, to agree with their\r\nvictors concerning the redemption of their arms and their horses,\r\nwhich, according to the laws of the tournament, they had forfeited. The\r\nfifth of their number alone tarried in the lists long enough to be\r\ngreeted by the applauses of the spectators, amongst whom he retreated,\r\nto the aggravation, doubtless, of his companions\xe2\x80\x99 mortification.\r\n\r\nA second and a third party of knights took the field; and although they\r\nhad various success, yet, upon the whole, the advantage decidedly\r\nremained with the challengers, not one of whom lost his seat or swerved\r\nfrom his charge\xe2\x80\x94misfortunes which befell one or two of their\r\nantagonists in each encounter. The spirits, therefore, of those opposed\r\nto them, seemed to be considerably damped by their continued success.\r\nThree knights only appeared on the fourth entry, who, avoiding the\r\nshields of Bois-Guilbert and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, contented themselves with\r\ntouching those of the three other knights, who had not altogether\r\nmanifested the same strength and dexterity. This politic selection did\r\nnot alter the fortune of the field, the challengers were still\r\nsuccessful: one of their antagonists was overthrown, and both the\r\nothers failed in the \xe2\x80\x9cattaint\xe2\x80\x9d, 18 that is, in striking the helmet and\r\nshield of their antagonist firmly and strongly, with the lance held in\r\na direct line, so that the weapon might break unless the champion was\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\nAfter this fourth encounter, there was a considerable pause; nor did it\r\nappear that any one was very desirous of renewing the contest. The\r\nspectators murmured among themselves; for, among the challengers,\r\nMalvoisin and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf were unpopular from their characters, and\r\nthe others, except Grantmesnil, were disliked as strangers and\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nBut none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as\r\nCedric the Saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the Norman\r\nchallengers, a repeated triumph over the honour of England. His own\r\neducation had taught him no skill in the games of chivalry, although,\r\nwith the arms of his Saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on\r\nmany occasions, a brave and determined soldier. He looked anxiously to\r\nAthelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age, as if\r\ndesiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the\r\nvictory which was passing into the hands of the Templar and his\r\nassociates. But, though both stout of heart, and strong of person,\r\nAthelstane had a disposition too inert and unambitious to make the\r\nexertions which Cedric seemed to expect from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day is against England, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, in a marked tone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9care you not tempted to take the lance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall tilt to-morrow\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cin the \xe2\x80\x98melee\xe2\x80\x99; it is\r\nnot worth while for me to arm myself to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo things displeased Cedric in this speech. It contained the Norman\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cmelee\xe2\x80\x9d, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced some\r\nindifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by\r\nAthelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not\r\ntrust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. Moreover, he had\r\nno time to make any remark, for Wamba thrust in his word, observing,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a\r\nhundred, than the best man of two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but Cedric,\r\nwho better understood the Jester\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, darted at him a severe and\r\nmenacing look; and lucky it was for Wamba, perhaps, that the time and\r\nplace prevented his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service,\r\nmore sensible marks of his master\xe2\x80\x99s resentment.\r\n\r\nThe pause in the tournament was still uninterrupted, excepting by the\r\nvoices of the heralds exclaiming\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLove of ladies, splintering of\r\nlances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild\r\nbursts expressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a\r\nholiday which seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and\r\nnobles lamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the\r\ntriumphs of their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now\r\nsupply dames of such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of\r\nformer times. Prince John began to talk to his attendants about making\r\nready the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights,\r\nand foiled a third.\r\n\r\nAt length, as the Saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of\r\nthose long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence\r\nof the lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a\r\nnote of defiance from the northern extremity. All eyes were turned to\r\nsee the new champion which these sounds announced, and no sooner were\r\nthe barriers opened than he paced into the lists. As far as could be\r\njudged of a man sheathed in armour, the new adventurer did not greatly\r\nexceed the middle size, and seemed to be rather slender than strongly\r\nmade. His suit of armour was formed of steel, richly inlaid with gold,\r\nand the device on his shield was a young oak-tree pulled up by the\r\nroots, with the Spanish word Desdichado, signifying Disinherited. He\r\nwas mounted on a gallant black horse, and as he passed through the\r\nlists he gracefully saluted the Prince and the ladies by lowering his\r\nlance. The dexterity with which he managed his steed, and something of\r\nyouthful grace which he displayed in his manner, won him the favour of\r\nthe multitude, which some of the lower classes expressed by calling\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cTouch Ralph de Vipont\xe2\x80\x99s shield\xe2\x80\x94touch the Hospitallers shield; he\r\nhas the least sure seat, he is your cheapest bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, ascended the\r\nplatform by the sloping alley which led to it from the lists, and, to\r\nthe astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central\r\npavilion, struck with the sharp end of his spear the shield of Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his\r\npresumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whom he had thus\r\ndefied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge,\r\nwas standing carelessly at the door of the pavilion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you confessed yourself, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cand have you\r\nheard mass this morning, that you peril your life so frankly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am fitter to meet death than thou art\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Disinherited\r\nKnight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books\r\nof the tourney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take your place in the lists,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand look your\r\nlast upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy for thy courtesy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Disinherited Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cand to\r\nrequite it, I advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance, for by\r\nmy honour you will need both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward\r\ndown the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same\r\nmanner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the northern\r\nextremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his\r\nantagonist. This feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of\r\nthe multitude.\r\n\r\nHowever incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he\r\nrecommended, Brian de Bois-Guilbert did not neglect his advice; for his\r\nhonour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means\r\nwhich might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent. He changed\r\nhis horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. He\r\nchose a new and a tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have\r\nbeen strained in the previous encounters he had sustained. Lastly, he\r\nlaid aside his shield, which had received some little damage, and\r\nreceived another from his squires. His first had only borne the general\r\ndevice of his rider, representing two knights riding upon one horse, an\r\nemblem expressive of the original humility and poverty of the Templars,\r\nqualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth\r\nthat finally occasioned their suppression. Bois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x99s new shield\r\nbore a raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing\r\nthe motto, \xe2\x80\x9cGare le Corbeau\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nWhen the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two\r\nextremities of the lists, the public expectation was strained to the\r\nhighest pitch. Few augured the possibility that the encounter could\r\nterminate well for the Disinherited Knight, yet his courage and\r\ngallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThe trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions\r\nvanished from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in\r\nthe centre of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. The lances\r\nburst into shivers up to the very grasp, and it seemed at the moment\r\nthat both knights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil\r\nbackwards upon its haunches. The address of the riders recovered their\r\nsteeds by use of the bridle and spur; and having glared on each other\r\nfor an instant with eyes which seemed to flash fire through the bars of\r\ntheir visors, each made a demi-volte, and, retiring to the extremity of\r\nthe lists, received a fresh lance from the attendants.\r\n\r\nA loud shout from the spectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs,\r\nand general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators\r\nin this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which\r\nhad graced the day. But no sooner had the knights resumed their\r\nstation, than the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so\r\ndeep and so dead, that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nA few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their\r\nhorses might recover breath, Prince John with his truncheon signed to\r\nthe trumpets to sound the onset. The champions a second time sprung\r\nfrom their stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the\r\nsame speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same\r\nequal fortune as before.\r\n\r\nIn this second encounter, the Templar aimed at the centre of his\r\nantagonist\xe2\x80\x99s shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear\r\nwent to shivers, and the Disinherited Knight reeled in his saddle. On\r\nthe other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career,\r\ndirected the point of his lance towards Bois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x99s shield, but,\r\nchanging his aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it to\r\nthe helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained,\r\nrendered the shock more irresistible. Fair and true he hit the Norman\r\non the visor, where his lance\xe2\x80\x99s point kept hold of the bars. Yet, even\r\nat this disadvantage, the Templar sustained his high reputation; and\r\nhad not the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been\r\nunhorsed. As it chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the\r\nground under a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the\r\nTemplar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at\r\nhis disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the\r\nspectators, he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his\r\nconqueror. The Disinherited Knight sprung from his steed, and also\r\nunsheathed his sword. The marshals of the field, however, spurred their\r\nhorses between them, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament\r\ndid not, on the present occasion, permit this species of encounter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall meet again, I trust,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, casting a resentful\r\nglance at his antagonist; \xe2\x80\x9cand where there are none to separate us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we do not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Disinherited Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fault shall not be\r\nmine. On foot or horseback, with spear, with axe, or with sword, I am\r\nalike ready to encounter thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals,\r\ncrossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. The\r\nDisinherited Knight returned to his first station, and Bois-Guilbert to\r\nhis tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nWithout alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of\r\nwine, and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced\r\nthat he quaffed it, \xe2\x80\x9cTo all true English hearts, and to the confusion\r\nof foreign tyrants.\xe2\x80\x9d He then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance\r\nto the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he\r\nshould make no election, but was willing to encounter them in the order\r\nin which they pleased to advance against him.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, armed in sable armour, was the first who\r\ntook the field. He bore on a white shield a black bull\xe2\x80\x99s head, half\r\ndefaced by the numerous encounters which he had undergone, and bearing\r\nthe arrogant motto, \xe2\x80\x9cCave, Adsum\xe2\x80\x9d. Over this champion the Disinherited\r\nKnight obtained a slight but decisive advantage. Both Knights broke\r\ntheir lances fairly, but Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, who lost a stirrup in the\r\nencounter, was adjudged to have the disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIn the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s third encounter with Sir Philip Malvoisin, he was\r\nequally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that\r\nthe laces of the helmet broke, and Malvoisin, only saved from falling\r\nby being unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.\r\n\r\nIn his fourth combat with De Grantmesnil, the Disinherited Knight\r\nshowed as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and\r\ndexterity. De Grantmesnil\xe2\x80\x99s horse, which was young and violent, reared\r\nand plunged in the course of the career so as to disturb the rider\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naim, and the stranger, declining to take the advantage which this\r\naccident afforded him, raised his lance, and passing his antagonist\r\nwithout touching him, wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own\r\nend of the lists, offering his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a\r\nsecond encounter. This De Grantmesnil declined, avowing himself\r\nvanquished as much by the courtesy as by the address of his opponent.\r\n\r\nRalph de Vipont summed up the list of the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s triumphs, being\r\nhurled to the ground with such force, that the blood gushed from his\r\nnose and his mouth, and he was borne senseless from the lists.\r\n\r\nThe acclamations of thousands applauded the unanimous award of the\r\nPrince and marshals, announcing that day\xe2\x80\x99s honours to the Disinherited\r\nKnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94In the midst was seen\r\nA lady of a more majestic mien,\r\nBy stature and by beauty mark\xe2\x80\x99d their sovereign Queen.\r\n\r\nAnd as in beauty she surpass\xe2\x80\x99d the choir,\r\nSo nobler than the rest was her attire;\r\nA crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,\r\nPlain without pomp, and rich without a show;\r\nA branch of Agnus Castus in her hand,\r\nShe bore aloft her symbol of command.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLOWER AND THE LEAF\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam de Wyvil and Stephen de Martival, the marshals of the field,\r\nwere the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying\r\nhim, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at\r\nleast, that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive\r\nthe prize of the day\xe2\x80\x99s tourney from the hands of Prince John. The\r\nDisinherited Knight, with all knightly courtesy, declined their\r\nrequest, alleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be\r\nseen, for reasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered\r\nthe lists. The marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply; for\r\namidst the frequent and capricious vows by which knights were\r\naccustomed to bind themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none\r\nmore common than those by which they engaged to remain incognito for a\r\ncertain space, or until some particular adventure was achieved. The\r\nmarshals, therefore, pressed no farther into the mystery of the\r\nDisinherited Knight, but, announcing to Prince John the conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesire to remain unknown, they requested permission to bring him before\r\nhis Grace, in order that he might receive the reward of his valour.\r\n\r\nJohn\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger;\r\nand, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in\r\nwhich the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated\r\nby one knight, he answered haughtily to the marshals, \xe2\x80\x9cBy the light of\r\nOur Lady\xe2\x80\x99s brow, this same knight hath been disinherited as well of his\r\ncourtesy as of his lands, since he desires to appear before us without\r\nuncovering his face.\xe2\x80\x94Wot ye, my lords,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning round to his\r\ntrain, \xe2\x80\x9cwho this gallant can be, that bears himself thus proudly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot guess,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cnor did I think there had been\r\nwithin the four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear down\r\nthese five knights in one day\xe2\x80\x99s jousting. By my faith, I shall never\r\nforget the force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller\r\nwas hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoast not of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Knight of St John, who was present; \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nTemple champion had no better luck. I saw your brave lance,\r\nBois-Guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at\r\nevery turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Bracy, being attached to the Templars, would have replied, but was\r\nprevented by Prince John. \xe2\x80\x9cSilence, sirs!\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat unprofitable\r\ndebate have we here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe victor,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Wyvil, \xe2\x80\x9cstill waits the pleasure of your\r\nhighness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d answered John, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he do so wait until we learn\r\nwhether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and\r\nquality. Should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough\r\nto keep him warm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cwill do less than due honour to\r\nthe victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that\r\nwhich we cannot know; at least I can form no guess\xe2\x80\x94unless he be one of\r\nthe good lances who accompanied King Richard to Palestine, and who are\r\nnow straggling homeward from the Holy Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be the Earl of Salisbury,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9che is about the same\r\npitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas de Multon, the Knight of Gilsland, rather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSalisbury is bigger in the bones.\xe2\x80\x9d A whisper arose among the train,\r\nbut by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might be the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x94it might be Richard C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver God\xe2\x80\x99s forbode!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, involuntarily turning at the\r\nsame time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of\r\nlightning; \xe2\x80\x9cWaldemar!\xe2\x80\x94De Bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember\r\nyour promises, and stand truly by me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is no danger impending,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar Fitzurse; \xe2\x80\x9care you so\r\nlittle acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your father\xe2\x80\x99s son, as to\r\nthink they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit of\r\narmour?\xe2\x80\x94De Wyvil and Martival, you will best serve the Prince by\r\nbringing forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has\r\nconjured all the blood from his cheeks.\xe2\x80\x94Look at him more closely,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cyour highness will see that he wants three inches of King\r\nRichard\xe2\x80\x99s height, and twice as much of his shoulder-breadth. The very\r\nhorse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of King\r\nRichard through a single course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the\r\nDisinherited Knight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which\r\nformed the ascent from the lists to Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s throne. Still\r\ndiscomposed with the idea that his brother, so much injured, and to\r\nwhom he was so much indebted, had suddenly arrived in his native\r\nkingdom, even the distinctions pointed out by Fitzurse did not\r\naltogether remove the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s apprehensions; and while, with a short\r\nand embarrassed eulogy upon his valour, he caused to be delivered to\r\nhim the war-horse assigned as the prize, he trembled lest from the\r\nbarred visor of the mailed form before him, an answer might be\r\nreturned, in the deep and awful accents of Richard the Lion-hearted.\r\n\r\nBut the Disinherited Knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment\r\nof the Prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.\r\n\r\nThe horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the\r\nanimal itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture;\r\nwhich, however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in\r\nthe eyes of those who were judges. Laying one hand upon the pommel of\r\nthe saddle, the Disinherited Knight vaulted at once upon the back of\r\nthe steed without making use of the stirrup, and, brandishing aloft his\r\nlance, rode twice around the lists, exhibiting the points and paces of\r\nthe horse with the skill of a perfect horseman.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of vanity, which might otherwise have been attributed to\r\nthis display, was removed by the propriety shown in exhibiting to the\r\nbest advantage the princely reward with which he had been just\r\nhonoured, and the Knight was again greeted by the acclamations of all\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the bustling Prior of Jorvaulx had reminded Prince\r\nJohn, in a whisper, that the victor must now display his good judgment,\r\ninstead of his valour, by selecting from among the beauties who graced\r\nthe galleries a lady, who should fill the throne of the Queen of Beauty\r\nand of Love, and deliver the prize of the tourney upon the ensuing day.\r\nThe Prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the Knight\r\npassed him in his second career around the lists. The Knight turned\r\ntowards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within\r\na foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncommands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he\r\ninstantly reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and\r\nhigh excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Disinherited Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9csince that is the only\r\ntitle by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as\r\nprivilege, to name the fair lady, who, as Queen of Honour and of Love,\r\nis to preside over next day\xe2\x80\x99s festival. If, as a stranger in our land,\r\nyou should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we can\r\nonly say that Alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight Waldemar\r\nFitzurse, has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in\r\nplace. Nevertheless, it is your undoubted prerogative to confer on whom\r\nyou please this crown, by the delivery of which to the lady of your\r\nchoice, the election of to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s Queen will be formal and\r\ncomplete.\xe2\x80\x94Raise your lance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Knight obeyed; and Prince John placed upon its point a coronet of\r\ngreen satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge\r\nof which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed\r\ninterchangeably, like the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nIn the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of Waldemar\r\nFitzurse, John had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind,\r\nwhich was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low\r\nartifice and cunning. He wished to banish from the minds of the\r\nchivalry around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting\r\nthe Jewess Rebecca; he was desirous of conciliating Alicia\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nWaldemar, of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown\r\nhimself dissatisfied during the course of the day\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings. He had\r\nalso a wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for\r\nJohn was at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his\r\nambition. But besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up\r\nagainst the Disinherited Knight (towards whom he already entertained a\r\nstrong dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of Waldemar Fitzurse,\r\nwho was likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his\r\ndaughter, in case, as was not unlikely, the victor should make another\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nAnd so indeed it proved. For the Disinherited Knight passed the gallery\r\nclose to that of the Prince, in which the Lady Alicia was seated in the\r\nfull pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he\r\nhad hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his\r\nright of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that splendid\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nIt was worth while to see the different conduct of the beauties who\r\nunderwent this examination, during the time it was proceeding. Some\r\nblushed, some assumed an air of pride and dignity, some looked straight\r\nforward, and essayed to seem utterly unconscious of what was going on,\r\nsome drew back in alarm, which was perhaps affected, some endeavoured\r\nto forbear smiling, and there were two or three who laughed outright.\r\nThere were also some who dropped their veils over their charms; but, as\r\nthe Wardour Manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing,\r\nit may be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities,\r\nthey were willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair\r\nchance to the rising beauties of the age.\r\n\r\nAt length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the Lady\r\nRowena was placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to\r\nthe utmost.\r\n\r\nIt must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could\r\nhave bribed the Disinherited Knight, the part of the lists before which\r\nhe paused had merited his predilection. Cedric the Saxon, overjoyed at\r\nthe discomfiture of the Templar, and still more so at the miscarriage\r\nof his two malevolent neighbours, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and Malvoisin, had,\r\nwith his body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor\r\nin each course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and\r\nsoul. The Lady Rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal\r\nattention, though without openly betraying the same intense interest.\r\nEven the unmoved Athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his\r\napathy, when, calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to\r\nthe health of the Disinherited Knight. Another group, stationed under\r\nthe gallery occupied by the Saxons, had shown no less interest in the\r\nfate of the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Abraham!\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac of York, when the first course was run\r\nbetwixt the Templar and the Disinherited Knight, \xe2\x80\x9chow fiercely that\r\nGentile rides! Ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way\r\nfrom Barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild ass\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncolt\xe2\x80\x94and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to Joseph\r\nPareira, the armourer of Milan, besides seventy in the hundred of\r\nprofits, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the\r\nhighways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he risks his own person and limbs, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cin doing\r\nsuch a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his horse\r\nand armour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChild!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Isaac, somewhat heated, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest not what thou\r\nspeakest\xe2\x80\x94His neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and armour\r\nbelong to\xe2\x80\x94Holy Jacob! what was I about to say!\xe2\x80\x94Nevertheless, it is a\r\ngood youth\xe2\x80\x94See, Rebecca! see, he is again about to go up to battle\r\nagainst the Philistine\xe2\x80\x94Pray, child\xe2\x80\x94pray for the safety of the good\r\nyouth,\xe2\x80\x94and of the speedy horse, and the rich armour.\xe2\x80\x94God of my\r\nfathers!\xe2\x80\x9d he again exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9che hath conquered, and the uncircumcised\r\nPhilistine hath fallen before his lance,\xe2\x80\x94even as Og the King of Bashan,\r\nand Sihon, King of the Amorites, fell before the sword of our\r\nfathers!\xe2\x80\x94Surely he shall take their gold and their silver, and their\r\nwar-horses, and their armour of brass and of steel, for a prey and for\r\na spoil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same anxiety did the worthy Jew display during every course that\r\nwas run, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the\r\nvalue of the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon\r\neach new success. There had been therefore no small interest taken in\r\nthe success of the Disinherited Knight, by those who occupied the part\r\nof the lists before which he now paused.\r\n\r\nWhether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the\r\nchampion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while\r\nthe eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and\r\nthen, gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he\r\ndeposited the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair\r\nRowena. The trumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed\r\nthe Lady Rowena the Queen of Beauty and of Love for the ensuing day,\r\nmenacing with suitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her\r\nauthority. They then repeated their cry of Largesse, to which Cedric,\r\nin the height of his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which\r\nAthelstane, though less promptly, added one equally large.\r\n\r\nThere was some murmuring among the damsels of Norman descent, who were\r\nas much unused to see the preference given to a Saxon beauty, as the\r\nNorman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which\r\nthey themselves had introduced. But these sounds of disaffection were\r\ndrowned by the popular shout of \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the Lady Rowena, the chosen\r\nand lawful Queen of Love and of Beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d To which many in the lower\r\narea added, \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the Saxon Princess! long live the race of the\r\nimmortal Alfred!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever unacceptable these sounds might be to Prince John, and to those\r\naround him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the\r\nnomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left his\r\nthrone; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again\r\nentered the lists. The Prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of\r\nthe Lady Alicia, to whom he paid his compliments, observing, at the\r\nsame time, to those around him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBy my halidome, sirs! if the Knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeats in arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews, his choice hath\r\nno less proved that his eyes are none of the clearest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion, as during his whole life, John\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune,\r\nnot perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to\r\nconciliate. Waldemar Fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the\r\nPrince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been\r\nslighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no right of chivalry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmore precious or inalienable\r\nthan that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own\r\njudgment. My daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own\r\ncharacter, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full\r\nproportion of that which is her due.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent to\r\nhis vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where\r\nRowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssume,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which\r\nnone vows homage more sincerely than ourself, John of Anjou; and if it\r\nplease you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our\r\nbanquet in the Castle of Ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to\r\nwhose service we devote to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRowena remained silent, and Cedric answered for her in his native\r\nSaxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cpossesses not the language in which to\r\nreply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. I\r\nalso, and the noble Athelstane of Coningsburgh, speak only the\r\nlanguage, and practise only the manners, of our fathers. We therefore\r\ndecline with thanks your Highness\xe2\x80\x99s courteous invitation to the\r\nbanquet. To-morrow, the Lady Rowena will take upon her the state to\r\nwhich she has been called by the free election of the victor Knight,\r\nconfirmed by the acclamations of the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s head, in\r\ntoken of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat says he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, affecting not to understand the Saxon\r\nlanguage, in which, however, he was well skilled. The purport of\r\nCedric\xe2\x80\x99s speech was repeated to him in French. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of\r\ndignity.\xe2\x80\x94You, at least, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to the victor,\r\nwho had remained near the gallery, \xe2\x80\x9cwill this day share our banquet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice,\r\nexcused himself by pleading fatigue, and the necessity of preparing for\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s encounter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, haughtily; \xe2\x80\x9calthough unused to such\r\nrefusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though\r\nungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected Queen of\r\nBeauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train,\r\nand his turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the\r\nbreaking up and dispersion of the spectators.\r\n\r\nYet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially\r\nwhen combined with conscious want of desert, John had hardly proceeded\r\nthree paces, ere again, turning around, he fixed an eye of stern\r\nresentment upon the yeoman who had displeased him in the early part of\r\nthe day, and issued his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOn\r\nyour life, suffer not that fellow to escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yeoman stood the angry glance of the Prince with the same unvaried\r\nsteadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no intention to leave Ashby until the day after\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94I must see how Staffordshire and Leicestershire can draw\r\ntheir bows\xe2\x80\x94the forests of Needwood and Charnwood must rear good\r\narchers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John to his attendants, but not in direct reply,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill\r\nshould prove some apology for his insolence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is full time,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the \xe2\x80\x98outrecuidance\xe2\x80\x99 19 of these\r\npeasants should be restrained by some striking example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaldemar Fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the\r\nreadiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent.\r\nPrince John resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of\r\nthe multitude became general.\r\n\r\nIn various routes, according to the different quarters from which they\r\ncame, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen\r\nretiring over the plain. By far the most numerous part streamed towards\r\nthe town of Ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lodged\r\nin the castle, and where others found accommodation in the town itself.\r\nAmong these were most of the knights who had already appeared in the\r\ntournament, or who proposed to fight there the ensuing day, and who, as\r\nthey rode slowly along, talking over the events of the day, were\r\ngreeted with loud shouts by the populace. The same acclamations were\r\nbestowed upon Prince John, although he was indebted for them rather to\r\nthe splendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\nA more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited\r\nacclamation, attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw\r\nhimself from popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of\r\nthose pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use of\r\nwhich was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the field. On his\r\nretiring to his tent, many who had lingered in the lists, to look upon\r\nand form conjectures concerning him, also dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe signs and sounds of a tumultuous concourse of men lately crowded\r\ntogether in one place, and agitated by the same passing events, were\r\nnow exchanged for the distant hum of voices of different groups\r\nretreating in all directions, and these speedily died away in silence.\r\nNo other sounds were heard save the voices of the menials who stripped\r\nthe galleries of their cushions and tapestry, in order to put them in\r\nsafety for the night, and wrangled among themselves for the half-used\r\nbottles of wine and relics of the refreshment which had been served\r\nround to the spectators.\r\n\r\nBeyond the precincts of the lists more than one forge was erected; and\r\nthese now began to glimmer through the twilight, announcing the toil of\r\nthe armourers, which was to continue through the whole night, in order\r\nto repair or alter the suits of armour to be used again on the morrow.\r\n\r\nA strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to\r\ntwo hours, surrounded the lists, and kept watch during the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, like the sad presaging raven, that tolls\r\nThe sick man\xe2\x80\x99s passport in her hollow beak,\r\nAnd in the shadow of the silent night\r\nDoth shake contagion from her sable wings;\r\nVex\xe2\x80\x99d and tormented, runs poor Barrabas,\r\nWith fatal curses towards these Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEW OF MALTA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Disinherited Knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than\r\nsquires and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him,\r\nto bring fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath.\r\nTheir zeal on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since\r\nevery one desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many\r\nlaurels, yet had refused, even at the command of Prince John, to lift\r\nhis visor or to name his name. But their officious inquisitiveness was\r\nnot gratified. The Disinherited Knight refused all other assistance\r\nsave that of his own squire, or rather yeoman\xe2\x80\x94a clownish-looking man,\r\nwho, wrapt in a cloak of dark-coloured felt, and having his head and\r\nface half-buried in a Norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect\r\nthe incognito as much as his master. All others being excluded from the\r\ntent, this attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts\r\nof his armour, and placed food and wine before him, which the exertions\r\nof the day rendered very acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe Knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced\r\nto him that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak\r\nwith him. The Disinherited Knight had exchanged his armour for the long\r\nrobe usually worn by those of his condition, which, being furnished\r\nwith a hood, concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the\r\nwearer, almost as completely as the visor of the helmet itself, but the\r\ntwilight, which was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered a\r\ndisguise unnecessary, unless to persons to whom the face of an\r\nindividual chanced to be particularly well known.\r\n\r\nThe Disinherited Knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of\r\nhis tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom\r\nhe easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day\r\nfought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the laws of chivalry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the foremost of these men,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, Baldwin de Oyley, squire to the redoubted Knight Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present,\r\nthe Disinherited Knight, of the horse and armour used by the said Brian\r\nde Bois-Guilbert in this day\xe2\x80\x99s Passage of Arms, leaving it with your\r\nnobleness to retain or to ransom the same, according to your pleasure;\r\nfor such is the law of arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to\r\nawait the decision of the Disinherited Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you four, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Knight, addressing those who had last\r\nspoken, \xe2\x80\x9cand to your honourable and valiant masters, I have one common\r\nreply. Commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, I should\r\ndo ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by\r\nbraver cavaliers.\xe2\x80\x94I would I could here end my message to these gallant\r\nknights; but being, as I term myself, in truth and earnest, the\r\nDisinherited, I must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will,\r\nof their courtesy, be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour, since\r\nthat which I wear I can hardly term mine own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe stand commissioned, each of us,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the squire of Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cto offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses\r\nand suits of armour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Disinherited Knight. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf the sum my\r\npresent necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half,\r\ndistribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the\r\nother half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and\r\nattendants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep\r\nsense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a\r\nscale so extensive. The Disinherited Knight then addressed his\r\ndiscourse to Baldwin, the squire of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom your\r\nmaster,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will accept neither arms nor ransom. Say to him in\r\nmy name, that our strife is not ended\xe2\x80\x94no, not till we have fought as\r\nwell with swords as with lances\xe2\x80\x94as well on foot as on horseback. To\r\nthis mortal quarrel he has himself defied me, and I shall not forget\r\nthe challenge.\xe2\x80\x94Meantime, let him be assured, that I hold him not as one\r\nof his companions, with whom I can with pleasure exchange courtesies;\r\nbut rather as one with whom I stand upon terms of mortal defiance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Baldwin, \xe2\x80\x9cknows how to requite scorn with scorn,\r\nand blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. Since you\r\ndisdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have\r\nrated the arms of the other knights, I must leave his armour and his\r\nhorse here, being well assured that he will never deign to mount the\r\none nor wear the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have spoken well, good squire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Disinherited Knight,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwell and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an\r\nabsent master. Leave not, however, the horse and armour here. Restore\r\nthem to thy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good\r\nfriend, for thine own use. So far as they are mine, I bestow them upon\r\nyou freely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBaldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the\r\nDisinherited Knight entered the pavilion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus far, Gurth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, addressing his attendant, \xe2\x80\x9cthe reputation\r\nof English chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a Saxon swineherd, have not ill played the\r\npersonage of a Norman squire-at-arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYea, but,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Disinherited Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast ever kept me\r\nin anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,\r\nWamba the Jester, of whom I could never discover whether he were most\r\nknave or fool. Yet I could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master\r\npassed so near to me, dreaming all the while that Gurth was keeping his\r\nporkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of Rotherwood. If I\r\nam discovered\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Disinherited Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest my promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, for that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cI will never fail my friend for\r\nfear of my skin-cutting. I have a tough hide, that will bear knife or\r\nscourge as well as any boar\xe2\x80\x99s hide in my herd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, I will requite the risk you run for my love, Gurth,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Knight. \xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, I pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am richer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, putting them into his pouch, \xe2\x80\x9cthan ever was\r\nswineherd or bondsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this bag of gold to Ashby,\xe2\x80\x9d continued his master, \xe2\x80\x9cand find out\r\nIsaac the Jew of York, and let him pay himself for the horse and arms\r\nwith which his credit supplied me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, by St Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I will not do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, knave,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his master, \xe2\x80\x9cwilt thou not obey my commands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they be honest, reasonable, and Christian commands,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut this is none of these. To suffer the Jew to pay himself would be\r\ndishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it\r\nwere the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering\r\na believer to enrich an infidel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nDisinherited Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving\r\nthe apartment; \xe2\x80\x9cand it will go hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I content him\r\nwith one-half of his own asking.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he departed, and left the\r\nDisinherited Knight to his own perplexed ruminations; which, upon more\r\naccounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of\r\na nature peculiarly agitating and painful.\r\n\r\nWe must now change the scene to the village of Ashby, or rather to a\r\ncountry house in its vicinity belonging to a wealthy Israelite, with\r\nwhom Isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the\r\nJews, it is well known, being as liberal in exercising the duties of\r\nhospitality and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to\r\nbe reluctant and churlish in extending them to those whom they termed\r\nGentiles, and whose treatment of them certainly merited little\r\nhospitality at their hand.\r\n\r\nIn an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of\r\nan Oriental taste, Rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered\r\ncushions, which, piled along a low platform that surrounded the\r\nchamber, served, like the estrada of the Spaniards, instead of chairs\r\nand stools. She was watching the motions of her father with a look of\r\nanxious and filial affection, while he paced the apartment with a\r\ndejected mien and disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94sometimes casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as\r\none who laboured under great mental tribulation. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Jacob!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO, all ye twelve Holy Fathers of our tribe! what a losing\r\nventure is this for one who hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the\r\nlaw of Moses\xe2\x80\x94Fifty zecchins wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the\r\ntalons of a tyrant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seemed to give the gold to Prince\r\nJohn willingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly? the blotch of Egypt upon him!\xe2\x80\x94Willingly, saidst thou?\xe2\x80\x94Ay,\r\nas willingly as when, in the Gulf of Lyons, I flung over my merchandise\r\nto lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest\xe2\x80\x94robed the\r\nseething billows in my choice silks\xe2\x80\x94perfumed their briny foam with\r\nmyrrh and aloes\xe2\x80\x94enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! And\r\nwas not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made\r\nthe sacrifice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was a sacrifice which Heaven exacted to save our lives,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand the God of our fathers has since blessed your\r\nstore and your gettings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did\r\nto-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?\xe2\x80\x94O, daughter,\r\ndisinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our\r\nrace is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs\r\naround, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to\r\nsmile tamely, when we would revenge bravely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not thus of it, my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cwe also have\r\nadvantages. These Gentiles, cruel and oppressive as they are, are in\r\nsome sort dependent on the dispersed children of Zion, whom they\r\ndespise and persecute. Without the aid of our wealth, they could\r\nneither furnish forth their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace,\r\nand the gold which we lend them returns with increase to our coffers.\r\nWe are like the herb which flourisheth most when it is most trampled\r\non. Even this day\xe2\x80\x99s pageant had not proceeded without the consent of\r\nthe despised Jew, who furnished the means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast harped upon another string of\r\nsorrow. The goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit\r\nof my adventure with our Kirjath Jairam of Leicester\xe2\x80\x94there is a dead\r\nloss too\xe2\x80\x94ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the\r\nspace between two Sabbaths\xe2\x80\x94and yet it may end better than I now think,\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x99tis a good youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall not repent you of requiting the\r\ngood deed received of the stranger knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust so, daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cand I trust too in the rebuilding\r\nof Zion; but as well do I hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls\r\nand battlements of the new Temple, as to see a Christian, yea, the very\r\nbest of Christians, repay a debt to a Jew, unless under the awe of the\r\njudge and jailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and\r\nRebecca, perceiving that her attempts at consolation only served to\r\nawaken new subjects of complaint, wisely desisted from her unavailing\r\nefforts\xe2\x80\x94a prudential line of conduct, and we recommend to all who set\r\nup for comforters and advisers, to follow it in the like circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe evening was now becoming dark, when a Jewish servant entered the\r\napartment, and placed upon the table two silver lamps, fed with\r\nperfumed oil; the richest wines, and the most delicate refreshments,\r\nwere at the same time displayed by another Israelitish domestic on a\r\nsmall ebony table, inlaid with silver; for, in the interior of their\r\nhouses, the Jews refused themselves no expensive indulgences. At the\r\nsame time the servant informed Isaac, that a Nazarene (so they termed\r\nChristians, while conversing among themselves) desired to speak with\r\nhim. He that would live by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal\r\nof every one claiming business with him. Isaac at once replaced on the\r\ntable the untasted glass of Greek wine which he had just raised to his\r\nlips, and saying hastily to his daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cRebecca, veil thyself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncommanded the stranger to be admitted.\r\n\r\nJust as Rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver\r\ngauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and Gurth entered,\r\nwrapt in the ample folds of his Norman mantle. His appearance was\r\nrather suspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing\r\nhis bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou Isaac the Jew of York?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, in Saxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had\r\nrendered every tongue spoken in Britain familiar to him)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand who art\r\nthou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not to the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as my name is to thee,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cfor without knowing\r\nthine, how can I hold intercourse with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cI, being to pay money, must know that I\r\ndeliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not,\r\nI think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are come to pay moneys?\xe2\x80\x94Holy Father Abraham!\r\nthat altereth our relation to each other. And from whom dost thou bring\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Disinherited Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cvictor in this day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntournament. It is the price of the armour supplied to him by Kirjath\r\nJairam of Leicester, on thy recommendation. The steed is restored to\r\nthy stable. I desire to know the amount of the sum which I am to pay\r\nfor the armour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said he was a good youth!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Isaac with joyful exultation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cup of wine will do thee no harm,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, filling and handing to\r\nthe swineherd a richer drought than Gurth had ever before tasted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhow much money,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9chas thou brought with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, setting down the cup, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat nectar these\r\nunbelieving dogs drink, while true Christians are fain to quaff ale as\r\nmuddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!\xe2\x80\x94What money have I brought\r\nwith me?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Saxon, when he had finished this uncivil\r\nejaculation, \xe2\x80\x9ceven but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. What,\r\nIsaac! thou must bear a conscience, though it be a Jewish one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cthy master has won goodly steeds and rich\r\narmours with the strength of his lance, and of his right hand\xe2\x80\x94but \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\na good youth\xe2\x80\x94the Jew will take these in present payment, and render him\r\nback the surplus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master has disposed of them already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was the part of a fool. No\r\nChristians here could buy so many horses and armour\xe2\x80\x94no Jew except\r\nmyself would give him half the values. But thou hast a hundred zecchins\r\nwith thee in that bag,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, prying under Gurth\xe2\x80\x99s cloak, \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\na heavy one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, readily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual love\r\nof gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present instance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif I should say that I would take eighty zecchins for the good steed\r\nand the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder\xe2\x80\x99s profit, have you\r\nmoney to pay me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than\r\nhe expected, \xe2\x80\x9cand it will leave my master nigh penniless. Nevertheless,\r\nif such be your least offer, I must be content.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill thyself another goblet of wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! eighty\r\nzecchins is too little. It leaveth no profit for the usages of the\r\nmoneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s encounter. O, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and\r\nsteed rushing on each other like wild bulls of Bashan! The horse cannot\r\nbut have had wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9che is sound, wind and limb; and you may\r\nsee him now, in your stable. And I say, over and above, that seventy\r\nzecchins is enough for the armour, and I hope a Christian\xe2\x80\x99s word is as\r\ngood as a Jew\xe2\x80\x99s. If you will not take seventy, I will carry this bag\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(and he shook it till the contents jingled) \xe2\x80\x9cback to my master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9clay down the talents\xe2\x80\x94the shekels\xe2\x80\x94the eighty\r\nzecchins, and thou shalt see I will consider thee liberally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth at length complied; and telling out eighty zecchins upon the\r\ntable, the Jew delivered out to him an acquittance for the horse and\r\nsuit of armour. The Jew\xe2\x80\x99s hand trembled for joy as he wrapped up the\r\nfirst seventy pieces of gold. The last ten he told over with much\r\ndeliberation, pausing, and saying something as he took each piece from\r\nthe table, and dropt it into his purse. It seemed as if his avarice\r\nwere struggling with his better nature, and compelling him to pouch\r\nzecchin after zecchin while his generosity urged him to restore some\r\npart at least to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. His\r\nwhole speech ran nearly thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy-one\xe2\x80\x94seventy-two; thy master is a good youth\xe2\x80\x94seventy-three, an\r\nexcellent youth\xe2\x80\x94seventy-four\xe2\x80\x94that piece hath been clipt within the\r\nring\xe2\x80\x94seventy-five\xe2\x80\x94and that looketh light of weight\xe2\x80\x94seventy-six\xe2\x80\x94when thy\r\nmaster wants money, let him come to Isaac of York\xe2\x80\x94seventy-seven\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis, with reasonable security.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he made a considerable pause, and\r\nGurth had good hope that the last three pieces might escape the fate of\r\ntheir comrades; but the enumeration proceeded.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy-eight\xe2\x80\x94thou art\r\na good fellow\xe2\x80\x94seventy-nine\xe2\x80\x94and deservest something for thyself\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending,\r\ndoubtless, to bestow it upon Gurth. He weighed it upon the tip of his\r\nfinger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. Had it rung too\r\nflat, or had it felt a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth too light, generosity had carried\r\nthe day; but, unhappily for Gurth, the chime was full and true, the\r\nzecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight. Isaac could not\r\nfind in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in\r\nabsence of mind, with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cEighty completes the tale, and I\r\ntrust thy master will reward thee handsomely.\xe2\x80\x94Surely,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nlooking earnestly at the bag, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast more coins in that pouch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cAbout the same quantity which thou hast just told over so\r\ncarefully.\xe2\x80\x9d He then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap,\r\nadding,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPeril of thy beard, Jew, see that this be full and ample!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nfilled himself unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment\r\nwithout ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me.\r\nNevertheless his master is a good youth\xe2\x80\x94ay, and I am well pleased that\r\nhe hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the speed\r\nof his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of\r\nGoliath the Philistine, might vie with a weaver\xe2\x80\x99s beam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he turned to receive Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s answer, he observed, that during his\r\nchattering with Gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached\r\nthe dark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the\r\nentrance, when a figure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which\r\nshe held in her hand, beckoned him into a side apartment. Gurth had\r\nsome reluctance to obey the summons. Rough and impetuous as a wild\r\nboar, where only earthly force was to be apprehended, he had all the\r\ncharacteristic terrors of a Saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends,\r\nwhite women, and the whole of the superstitions which his ancestors had\r\nbrought with them from the wilds of Germany. He remembered, moreover,\r\nthat he was in the house of a Jew, a people who, besides the other\r\nunamiable qualities which popular report ascribed to them, were\r\nsupposed to be profound necromancers and cabalists. Nevertheless, after\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, he obeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition,\r\nand followed her into the apartment which she indicated, where he found\r\nto his joyful surprise that his fair guide was the beautiful Jewess\r\nwhom he had seen at the tournament, and a short time in her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nShe asked him the particulars of his transaction with Isaac, which he\r\ndetailed accurately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father did but jest with thee, good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9che owes\r\nthy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were\r\ntheir value tenfold. What sum didst thou pay my father even now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighty zecchins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, surprised at the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this purse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthou wilt find a hundred. Restore to\r\nthy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the\r\nremainder. Haste\xe2\x80\x94begone\xe2\x80\x94stay not to render thanks! and beware how you\r\npass through this crowded town, where thou mayst easily lose both thy\r\nburden and thy life.\xe2\x80\x94Reuben,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, clapping her hands together,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clight forth this stranger, and fail not to draw lock and bar behind\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d Reuben, a dark-brow\xe2\x80\x99d and black-bearded Israelite, obeyed her\r\nsummons, with a torch in his hand; undid the outward door of the house,\r\nand conducting Gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket\r\nin the entrance-gate, which he closed behind him with such bolts and\r\nchains as would well have become that of a prison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nis no Jewess, but an angel from heaven! Ten zecchins from my brave\r\nyoung master\xe2\x80\x94twenty from this pearl of Zion\xe2\x80\x94Oh, happy day!\xe2\x80\x94Such\r\nanother, Gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a brother as\r\nfree of thy guild as the best. And then do I lay down my swineherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhorn and staff, and take the freeman\xe2\x80\x99s sword and buckler, and follow my\r\nyoung master to the death, without hiding either my face or my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n1st Outlaw: Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you;\r\nIf not, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make you sit, and rifle you.\r\nSpeed: Sir, we are undone! these are the villains\r\nThat all the travellers do fear so much.\r\nVal: My friends,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n1st Out: That\xe2\x80\x99s not so, sir, we are your enemies.\r\n2d Out: Peace! we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him.\r\n3d Out: Ay, by my beard, will we;\r\nFor he\xe2\x80\x99s a proper man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal adventures of Gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he\r\nhimself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two\r\nstraggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found\r\nhimself in a deep lane, running between two banks overgrown with hazel\r\nand holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether\r\nacross the path. The lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the\r\ncarriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to\r\nthe tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and bushes intercepted\r\nthe light of the harvest moon.\r\n\r\nFrom the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed\r\noccasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and\r\nsometimes by wild strains of distant music. All these sounds,\r\nintimating the disorderly state of the town, crowded with military\r\nnobles and their dissolute attendants, gave Gurth some uneasiness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nJewess was right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cBy heaven and St Dunstan, I\r\nwould I were safe at my journey\xe2\x80\x99s end with all this treasure! Here are\r\nsuch numbers, I will not say of arrant thieves, but of errant knights\r\nand errant squires, errant monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers\r\nand errant jesters, that a man with a single merk would be in danger,\r\nmuch more a poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins. Would I\r\nwere out of the shade of these infernal bushes, that I might at least\r\nsee any of St Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99s clerks before they spring on my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common\r\nto which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his\r\nobject. Just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the\r\nunderwood was thickest, four men sprung upon him, even as his fears\r\nanticipated, two from each side of the road, and seized him so fast,\r\nthat resistance, if at first practicable, would have been now too\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSurrender your charge,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are the deliverers\r\nof the commonwealth, who ease every man of his burden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should not ease me of mine so lightly,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Gurth, whose\r\nsurly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate\r\nviolence,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chad I it but in my power to give three strokes in its\r\ndefence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see that presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber; and, speaking to his\r\ncompanions, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cbring along the knave. I see he would have his\r\nhead broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins\r\nat once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been\r\ndragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the\r\nlane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and\r\nthe open common. He was compelled to follow his rough conductors into\r\nthe very depth of this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an\r\nirregular open space, free in a great measure from trees, and on which,\r\ntherefore, the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from\r\nboughs and leaves. Here his captors were joined by two other persons,\r\napparently belonging to the gang. They had short swords by their sides,\r\nand quarter-staves in their hands, and Gurth could now observe that all\r\nsix wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no\r\nquestion, even had their former proceedings left it in doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat money hast thou, churl?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the thieves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty zecchins of my own property,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA forfeit\xe2\x80\x94a forfeit,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the robbers; \xe2\x80\x9ca Saxon hath thirty\r\nzecchins, and returns sober from a village! An undeniable and\r\nunredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoarded it to purchase my freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art an ass,\xe2\x80\x9d replied one of the thieves \xe2\x80\x9cthree quarts of double\r\nale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he\r\nbe a Saxon like thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sad truth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if these same thirty zecchins will\r\nbuy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and I will pay them to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold,\xe2\x80\x9d said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis bag which thou bearest, as I can feel through thy cloak, contains\r\nmore coin than thou hast told us of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the good knight my master\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cof which,\r\nassuredly, I would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with\r\nworking your will upon mine own property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art an honest fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the robber, \xe2\x80\x9cI warrant thee; and\r\nwe worship not St Nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may\r\nyet escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. Meantime render up thy\r\ntrust for a time.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he took from Gurth\xe2\x80\x99s breast the large\r\nleathern pouch, in which the purse given him by Rebecca was enclosed,\r\nas well as the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his\r\ninterrogation.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWho is thy master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Disinherited Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose good lance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the robber, \xe2\x80\x9cwon the prize in to-day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntourney? What is his name and lineage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is his pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they be concealed; and from\r\nme, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is thine own name and lineage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cmight reveal my master\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a saucy groom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the robber, \xe2\x80\x9cbut of that anon. How comes\r\nthy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means\r\nhath it accrued to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy his good lance,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThese bags contain the ransom of\r\nfour good horses, and four good suits of armour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much is there?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the robber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred zecchins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly two hundred zecchins!\xe2\x80\x9d said the bandit; \xe2\x80\x9cyour master hath dealt\r\nliberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. Name those\r\nwho paid the gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe armour and horse of the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, at what\r\nransom were they held?\xe2\x80\x94Thou seest thou canst not deceive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy master,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cwill take nought from the Templar save his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s-blood. They are on terms of mortal defiance, and cannot hold\r\ncourteous intercourse together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what wert thou now doing at Ashby with such a charge in thy\r\ncustody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went thither to render to Isaac the Jew of York,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this\r\ntournament.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much didst thou pay to Isaac?\xe2\x80\x94Methinks, to judge by weight,\r\nthere is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI paid to Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9ceighty zecchins, and he restored me\r\na hundred in lieu thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! what!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed all the robbers at once; \xe2\x80\x9cdarest thou trifle\r\nwith us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cis as true as the moon is in heaven.\r\nYou will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch,\r\nand separate from the rest of the gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBethink thee, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthou speakest of a Jew\xe2\x80\x94of an\r\nIsraelite,\xe2\x80\x94as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of his deserts to\r\nreturn the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no more mercy in them,\xe2\x80\x9d said another of the banditti, \xe2\x80\x9cthan\r\nin an unbribed sheriffs officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, however, as I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrike a light instantly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI will examine this said\r\npurse; and if it be as this fellow says, the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s bounty is little\r\nless miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the\r\nwilderness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine\r\nthe purse. The others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of\r\nGurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the\r\nissue of the search. Availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden\r\nexertion of strength and activity, Gurth shook himself free of their\r\nhold, and might have escaped, could he have resolved to leave his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s property behind him. But such was no part of his intention. He\r\nwrenched a quarter-staff from one of the fellows, struck down the\r\nCaptain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh\r\nrepossessed himself of the pouch and treasure. The thieves, however,\r\nwere too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty\r\nGurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnave!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, getting up, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast broken my head; and\r\nwith other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy\r\ninsolence. But thou shalt know thy fate instantly. First let us speak\r\nof thy master; the knight\xe2\x80\x99s matters must go before the squire\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\naccording to the due order of chivalry. Stand thou fast in the\r\nmeantime\xe2\x80\x94if thou stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet\r\nfor thy life\xe2\x80\x94Comrades!\xe2\x80\x9d he then said, addressing his gang, \xe2\x80\x9cthis purse\r\nis embroidered with Hebrew characters, and I well believe the yeoman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntale is true. The errant knight, his master, must needs pass us\r\ntoll-free. He is too like ourselves for us to make booty of him, since\r\ndogs should not worry dogs where wolves and foxes are to be found in\r\nabundance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike us?\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of the gang; \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to hear how that is\r\nmade good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, thou fool,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cis he not poor and\r\ndisinherited as we are?\xe2\x80\x94Doth he not win his substance at the sword\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npoint as we do?\xe2\x80\x94Hath he not beaten Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and Malvoisin, even as\r\nwe would beat them if we could? Is he not the enemy to life and death\r\nof Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom we have so much reason to fear? And\r\nwere all this otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience\r\nthan an unbeliever, a Hebrew Jew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, that were a shame,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the other fellow; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet, when I\r\nserved in the band of stout old Gandelyn, we had no such scruples of\r\nconscience. And this insolent peasant,\xe2\x80\x94he too, I warrant me, is to be\r\ndismissed scatheless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if THOU canst scathe him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHere, fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued he, addressing Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9ccanst thou use the staff, that thou\r\nstarts to it so readily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shouldst be best able to reply to that\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and if thou\r\ndost not\xe2\x80\x94why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, I think I\r\nmust pay thy ransom myself.\xe2\x80\x94Take thy staff, Miller,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nkeep thy head; and do you others let the fellow go, and give him a\r\nstaff\xe2\x80\x94there is light enough to lay on load by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two champions being alike armed with quarter-staves, stepped\r\nforward into the centre of the open space, in order to have the full\r\nbenefit of the moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and\r\ncrying to their comrade, \xe2\x80\x9cMiller! beware thy toll-dish.\xe2\x80\x9d The Miller, on\r\nthe other hand, holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it\r\nflourish round his head after the fashion which the French call \xe2\x80\x9cfaire\r\nle moulinet\xe2\x80\x9d, exclaimed boastfully, \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, churl, an thou darest:\r\nthou shalt feel the strength of a miller\xe2\x80\x99s thumb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou be\xe2\x80\x99st a miller,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gurth, undauntedly, making his\r\nweapon play around his head with equal dexterity, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art doubly a\r\nthief, and I, as a true man, bid thee defiance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes\r\nthey displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill,\r\nintercepting and returning the blows of their adversary with the most\r\nrapid dexterity, while, from the continued clatter of their weapons, a\r\nperson at a distance might have supposed that there were at least six\r\npersons engaged on each side. Less obstinate, and even less dangerous\r\ncombats, have been described in good heroic verse; but that of Gurth\r\nand the Miller must remain unsung, for want of a sacred poet to do\r\njustice to its eventful progress. Yet, though quarter-staff play be out\r\nof date, what we can in prose we will do for these bold champions.\r\n\r\nLong they fought equally, until the Miller began to lose temper at\r\nfinding himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his\r\ncompanions, who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. This was\r\nnot a state of mind favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in\r\nwhich, as in ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite;\r\nand it gave Gurth, whose temper was steady, though surly, the\r\nopportunity of acquiring a decided advantage, in availing himself of\r\nwhich he displayed great mastery.\r\n\r\nThe Miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of\r\nhis weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance,\r\nwhile Gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands\r\nabout a yard asunder, and covering himself by shifting his weapon with\r\ngreat celerity, so as to protect his head and body. Thus did he\r\nmaintain the defensive, making his eye, foot, and hand keep true time,\r\nuntil, observing his antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at\r\nhis face with his left hand; and, as the Miller endeavoured to parry\r\nthe thrust, he slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full\r\nswing of the weapon struck his opponent on the left side of the head,\r\nwho instantly measured his length upon the green sward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell and yeomanly done!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the robbers; \xe2\x80\x9cfair play and Old\r\nEngland for ever! The Saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and\r\nthe Miller has met his match.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou mayst go thy ways, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, addressing\r\nGurth, in special confirmation of the general voice, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will cause\r\ntwo of my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npavilion, and to guard thee from night-walkers that might have less\r\ntender consciences than ours; for there is many one of them upon the\r\namble in such a night as this. Take heed, however,\xe2\x80\x9d he added sternly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cremember thou hast refused to tell thy name\xe2\x80\x94ask not after ours, nor\r\nendeavour to discover who or what we are; for, if thou makest such an\r\nattempt, thou wilt come by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGurth thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to\r\nhis recommendation. Two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves,\r\nand desiring Gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward\r\nalong a by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground\r\nadjacent to it. On the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his\r\nconductors, and receiving an answer in a whisper, withdrew into the\r\nwood, and suffered them to pass unmolested. This circumstance induced\r\nGurth to believe both that the gang was strong in numbers, and that\r\nthey kept regular guards around their place of rendezvous.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived on the open heath, where Gurth might have had some\r\ntrouble in finding his road, the thieves guided him straight forward to\r\nthe top of a little eminence, whence he could see, spread beneath him\r\nin the moonlight, the palisades of the lists, the glimmering pavilions\r\npitched at either end, with the pennons which adorned them fluttering\r\nin the moonbeams, and from which could be heard the hum of the song\r\nwith which the sentinels were beguiling their night-watch.\r\n\r\nHere the thieves stopt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe go with you no farther,\xe2\x80\x9d said they; \xe2\x80\x9cit were not safe that we\r\nshould do so.\xe2\x80\x94Remember the warning you have received\xe2\x80\x94keep secret what\r\nhas this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94neglect what is now told you, and the Tower of London shall not\r\nprotect you against our revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night to you, kind sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall remember your\r\norders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and\r\nan honester trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence\r\nthey had come, and Gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,\r\nnotwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the\r\nwhole adventures of the evening.\r\n\r\nThe Disinherited Knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the\r\ngenerosity of Rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not\r\nprofit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality\r\nseemed totally foreign. His course of reflections upon these singular\r\ncircumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking\r\nrepose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety of\r\nrefreshing himself for the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s encounter, rendered alike\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThe knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch\r\nwith which the tent was provided; and the faithful Gurth, extending his\r\nhardy limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the\r\npavilion, laid himself across the opening of the tent, so that no one\r\ncould enter without awakening him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heralds left their pricking up and down,\r\nNow ringen trumpets loud and clarion.\r\nThere is no more to say, but east and west,\r\nIn go the speares sadly in the rest,\r\nIn goth the sharp spur into the side,\r\nThere see men who can just and who can ride;\r\nThere shiver shaftes upon shieldes thick,\r\nHe feeleth through the heart-spone the prick;\r\nUp springen speares, twenty feet in height,\r\nOut go the swordes to the silver bright;\r\nThe helms they to-hewn and to-shred;\r\nOut burst the blood with stern streames red.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUCER\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning arose in unclouded splendour, and ere the sun was much above\r\nthe horizon, the idlest or the most eager of the spectators appeared on\r\nthe common, moving to the lists as to a general centre, in order to\r\nsecure a favourable situation for viewing the continuation of the\r\nexpected games.\r\n\r\nThe marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together\r\nwith the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights\r\nwho intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. This\r\nwas a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two\r\nbodies who should be opposed to each other.\r\n\r\nAccording to due formality, the Disinherited Knight was to be\r\nconsidered as leader of the one body, while Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who\r\nhad been rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was\r\nnamed first champion of the other band. Those who had concurred in the\r\nchallenge adhered to his party of course, excepting only Ralph de\r\nVipont, whom his fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour.\r\nThere was no want of distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the\r\nranks on either side.\r\n\r\nIn fact, although the general tournament, in which all knights fought\r\nat once, was more dangerous than single encounters, they were,\r\nnevertheless, more frequented and practised by the chivalry of the age.\r\nMany knights, who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to\r\ndefy a single adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless,\r\ndesirous of displaying their valour in the general combat, where they\r\nmight meet others with whom they were more upon an equality. On the\r\npresent occasion, about fifty knights were inscribed as desirous of\r\ncombating upon each side, when the marshals declared that no more could\r\nbe admitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in\r\npreferring their claim to be included.\r\n\r\nAbout the hour of ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the whole plain was crowded with\r\nhorsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament;\r\nand shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced Prince John\r\nand his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take\r\nshare in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time arrived Cedric the Saxon, with the Lady Rowena,\r\nunattended, however, by Athelstane. This Saxon lord had arrayed his\r\ntall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the\r\ncombatants; and, considerably to the surprise of Cedric, had chosen to\r\nenlist himself on the part of the Knight Templar. The Saxon, indeed,\r\nhad remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice\r\nhe had made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer\r\nusually given by those who are more obstinate in following their own\r\ncourse, than strong in justifying it.\r\n\r\nHis best, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, Athelstane had the prudence to keep to himself. Though\r\nhis apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend\r\nhimself to the Lady Rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means\r\ninsensible to her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter\r\nalready fixed beyond doubt, by the assent of Cedric and her other\r\nfriends. It had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the\r\nproud though indolent Lord of Coningsburgh beheld the victor of the\r\npreceding day select Rowena as the object of that honour which it\r\nbecame his privilege to confer. In order to punish him for a preference\r\nwhich seemed to interfere with his own suit, Athelstane, confident of\r\nhis strength, and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great\r\nskill in arms, had determined not only to deprive the Disinherited\r\nKnight of his powerful succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to\r\nmake him feel the weight of his battle-axe.\r\n\r\nDe Bracy, and other knights attached to Prince John, in obedience to a\r\nhint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, John being\r\ndesirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. On the other\r\nhand, many other knights, both English and Norman, natives and\r\nstrangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that the\r\nopposite band was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the\r\nDisinherited Knight had approved himself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Prince John observed that the destined Queen of the day had\r\narrived upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well\r\nupon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet\r\nher, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the\r\nLady Rowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same\r\ntime, and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is thus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we set the dutiful example of\r\nloyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves her guide to\r\nthe throne which she must this day occupy.\xe2\x80\x94Ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cattend\r\nyour Queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like\r\nhonours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Prince marshalled Rowena to the seat of honour opposite\r\nhis own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present\r\ncrowded after her to obtain places as near as possible to their\r\ntemporary sovereign.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Rowena seated, than a burst of music, half-drowned by the\r\nshouts of the multitude, greeted her new dignity. Meantime, the sun\r\nshone fierce and bright upon the polished arms of the knights of either\r\nside, who crowded the opposite extremities of the lists, and held eager\r\nconference together concerning the best mode of arranging their line of\r\nbattle, and supporting the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe heralds then proclaimed silence until the laws of the tourney\r\nshould be rehearsed. These were calculated in some degree to abate the\r\ndangers of the day; a precaution the more necessary, as the conflict\r\nwas to be maintained with sharp swords and pointed lances.\r\n\r\nThe champions were therefore prohibited to thrust with the sword, and\r\nwere confined to striking. A knight, it was announced, might use a mace\r\nor battle-axe at pleasure, but the dagger was a prohibited weapon. A\r\nknight unhorsed might renew the fight on foot with any other on the\r\nopposite side in the same predicament; but mounted horsemen were in\r\nthat case forbidden to assail him. When any knight could force his\r\nantagonist to the extremity of the lists, so as to touch the palisade\r\nwith his person or arms, such opponent was obliged to yield himself\r\nvanquished, and his armour and horse were placed at the disposal of the\r\nconqueror. A knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther\r\nshare in the combat. If any combatant was struck down, and unable to\r\nrecover his feet, his squire or page might enter the lists, and drag\r\nhis master out of the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged\r\nvanquished, and his arms and horse declared forfeited. The combat was\r\nto cease as soon as Prince John should throw down his leading staff, or\r\ntruncheon; another precaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary\r\neffusion of blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate.\r\nAny knight breaking the rules of the tournament, or otherwise\r\ntransgressing the rules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be stript\r\nof his arms, and, having his shield reversed to be placed in that\r\nposture astride upon the bars of the palisade, and exposed to public\r\nderision, in punishment of his unknightly conduct. Having announced\r\nthese precautions, the heralds concluded with an exhortation to each\r\ngood knight to do his duty, and to merit favour from the Queen of\r\nBeauty and of Love.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation having been made, the heralds withdrew to their\r\nstations. The knights, entering at either end of the lists in long\r\nprocession, arranged themselves in a double file, precisely opposite to\r\neach other, the leader of each party being in the centre of the\r\nforemost rank, a post which he did not occupy until each had carefully\r\nmarshalled the ranks of his party, and stationed every one in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt was a goodly, and at the same time an anxious, sight, to behold so\r\nmany gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready\r\nprepared for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles\r\nlike so many pillars of iron, and awaiting the signal of encounter with\r\nthe same ardour as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing\r\nthe ground, gave signal of their impatience.\r\n\r\nAs yet the knights held their long lances upright, their bright points\r\nglancing to the sun, and the streamers with which they were decorated\r\nfluttering over the plumage of the helmets. Thus they remained while\r\nthe marshals of the field surveyed their ranks with the utmost\r\nexactness, lest either party had more or fewer than the appointed\r\nnumber. The tale was found exactly complete. The marshals then withdrew\r\nfrom the lists, and William de Wyvil, with a voice of thunder,\r\npronounced the signal words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLaissez aller!\xe2\x80\x9d The trumpets sounded as he\r\nspoke\xe2\x80\x94the spears of the champions were at once lowered and placed in\r\nthe rests\xe2\x80\x94the spurs were dashed into the flanks of the horses, and the\r\ntwo foremost ranks of either party rushed upon each other in full\r\ngallop, and met in the middle of the lists with a shock, the sound of\r\nwhich was heard at a mile\xe2\x80\x99s distance. The rear rank of each party\r\nadvanced at a slower pace to sustain the defeated, and follow up the\r\nsuccess of the victors of their party.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of the encounter were not instantly seen, for the dust\r\nraised by the trampling of so many steeds darkened the air, and it was\r\na minute ere the anxious spectator could see the fate of the encounter.\r\nWhen the fight became visible, half the knights on each side were\r\ndismounted, some by the dexterity of their adversary\xe2\x80\x99s lance,\xe2\x80\x94some by\r\nthe superior weight and strength of opponents, which had borne down\r\nboth horse and man,\xe2\x80\x94some lay stretched on earth as if never more to\r\nrise,\xe2\x80\x94some had already gained their feet, and were closing hand to hand\r\nwith those of their antagonists who were in the same predicament,\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nseveral on both sides, who had received wounds by which they were\r\ndisabled, were stopping their blood by their scarfs, and endeavouring\r\nto extricate themselves from the tumult. The mounted knights, whose\r\nlances had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were\r\nnow closely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and\r\nexchanging buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nThe tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank on\r\neither side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their\r\ncompanions. The followers of Brian de Bois-Guilbert shouted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\r\nBeau-seant! Beau-seant! 20\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94For the Temple\xe2\x80\x94For the Temple!\xe2\x80\x9d The opposite party shouted in\r\nanswer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDesdichado! Desdichado!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which watch-word they took from the\r\nmotto upon their leader\xe2\x80\x99s shield.\r\n\r\nThe champions thus encountering each other with the utmost fury, and\r\nwith alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward\r\nthe southern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the\r\none or the other party prevailed. Meantime the clang of the blows, and\r\nthe shouts of the combatants, mixed fearfully with the sound of the\r\ntrumpets, and drowned the groans of those who fell, and lay rolling\r\ndefenceless beneath the feet of the horses. The splendid armour of the\r\ncombatants was now defaced with dust and blood, and gave way at every\r\nstroke of the sword and battle-axe. The gay plumage, shorn from the\r\ncrests, drifted upon the breeze like snow-flakes. All that was\r\nbeautiful and graceful in the martial array had disappeared, and what\r\nwas now visible was only calculated to awake terror or compassion.\r\n\r\nYet such is the force of habit, that not only the vulgar spectators,\r\nwho are naturally attracted by sights of horror, but even the ladies of\r\ndistinction who crowded the galleries, saw the conflict with a\r\nthrilling interest certainly, but without a wish to withdraw their eyes\r\nfrom a sight so terrible. Here and there, indeed, a fair cheek might\r\nturn pale, or a faint scream might be heard, as a lover, a brother, or\r\na husband, was struck from his horse. But, in general, the ladies\r\naround encouraged the combatants, not only by clapping their hands and\r\nwaving their veils and kerchiefs, but even by exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cBrave lance!\r\nGood sword!\xe2\x80\x9d when any successful thrust or blow took place under their\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nSuch being the interest taken by the fair sex in this bloody game, that\r\nof the men is the more easily understood. It showed itself in loud\r\nacclamations upon every change of fortune, while all eyes were so\r\nriveted on the lists, that the spectators seemed as if they themselves\r\nhad dealt and received the blows which were there so freely bestowed.\r\nAnd between every pause was heard the voice of the heralds, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFight on, brave knights! Man dies, but glory lives!\xe2\x80\x94Fight on\xe2\x80\x94death is\r\nbetter than defeat!\xe2\x80\x94Fight on, brave knights!\xe2\x80\x94for bright eyes behold\r\nyour deeds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to\r\ndiscover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the\r\nfight, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. Both\r\ndisplayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either Bois-Guilbert or the\r\nDisinherited Knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who\r\ncould be termed their unquestioned match. They repeatedly endeavoured\r\nto single out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that\r\nthe fall of either leader might be considered as decisive of victory.\r\nSuch, however, was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier\r\npart of the conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and they\r\nwere repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of\r\nwhom was anxious to win honour, by measuring his strength against the\r\nleader of the opposite party.\r\n\r\nBut when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had\r\nyielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity of\r\nthe lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the\r\nstrife, the Templar and the Disinherited Knight at length encountered\r\nhand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to\r\nrivalry of honour, could inspire. Such was the address of each in\r\nparrying and striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous\r\nand involuntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment the party of the Disinherited Knight had the worst;\r\nthe gigantic arm of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf on the one flank, and the ponderous\r\nstrength of Athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing those\r\nimmediately exposed to them. Finding themselves freed from their\r\nimmediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights\r\nat the same instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage\r\nto their party, by aiding the Templar in his contest with his rival.\r\nTurning their horses, therefore, at the same moment, the Norman spurred\r\nagainst the Disinherited Knight on the one side, and the Saxon on the\r\nother. It was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and\r\nunexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a\r\ngeneral cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one\r\nexposed to such disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeware! beware! Sir Disinherited!\xe2\x80\x9d was shouted so universally, that\r\nthe knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the\r\nTemplar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape\r\nthe charge of Athelstane and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf. These knights, therefore,\r\ntheir aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the\r\nobject of their attack and the Templar, almost running their horses\r\nagainst each other ere they could stop their career. Recovering their\r\nhorses however, and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their\r\nunited purpose of bearing to the earth the Disinherited Knight.\r\n\r\nNothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and\r\nactivity of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.\r\n\r\nThis stood him in the more stead, as the horse of Bois-Guilbert was\r\nwounded, and those of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and Athelstane were both tired with\r\nthe weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with\r\nthe preceding exertions of the day. The masterly horsemanship of the\r\nDisinherited Knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he\r\nmounted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at sword\xe2\x80\x99s point his\r\nthree antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon\r\nthe wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing\r\nnow against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with\r\nhis sword, without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nBut although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it was\r\nevident that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around\r\nPrince John implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and\r\nto save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, by the light of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince John; \xe2\x80\x9cthis same\r\nspringald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered\r\nhospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to let\r\nothers have their turn.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke thus, an unexpected incident\r\nchanged the fortune of the day.\r\n\r\nThere was among the ranks of the Disinherited Knight a champion in\r\nblack armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all\r\nappearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted.\r\nThis knight, who bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto\r\nevinced very little interest in the event of the fight, beating off\r\nwith seeming ease those combatants who attacked him, but neither\r\npursuing his advantages, nor himself assailing any one. In short, he\r\nhad hitherto acted the part rather of a spectator than of a party in\r\nthe tournament, a circumstance which procured him among the spectators\r\nthe name of \xe2\x80\x9cLe Noir Faineant\xe2\x80\x9d, or the Black Sluggard.\r\n\r\nAt once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he\r\ndiscovered the leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs\r\nto his horse, which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a\r\nthunderbolt, exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call, \xe2\x80\x9cDesdichado,\r\nto the rescue!\xe2\x80\x9d It was high time; for, while the Disinherited Knight\r\nwas pressing upon the Templar, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf had got nigh to him with\r\nhis uplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the Sable Knight\r\ndealt a stroke on his head, which, glancing from the polished helmet,\r\nlighted with violence scarcely abated on the \xe2\x80\x9cchamfron\xe2\x80\x9d of the steed,\r\nand Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf rolled on the ground, both horse and man equally\r\nstunned by the fury of the blow. \xe2\x80\x9cLe Noir Faineant\xe2\x80\x9d then turned his\r\nhorse upon Athelstane of Coningsburgh; and his own sword having been\r\nbroken in his encounter with Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, he wrenched from the hand\r\nof the bulky Saxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one\r\nfamiliar with the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the\r\ncrest, that Athelstane also lay senseless on the field. Having achieved\r\nthis double feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it\r\nwas totally unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the\r\nsluggishness of his character, returning calmly to the northern\r\nextremity of the lists, leaving his leader to cope as he best could\r\nwith Brian de Bois-Guilbert. This was no longer matter of so much\r\ndifficulty as formerly. The Templars horse had bled much, and gave way\r\nunder the shock of the Disinherited Knight\xe2\x80\x99s charge. Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert rolled on the field, encumbered with the stirrup, from\r\nwhich he was unable to draw his foot. His antagonist sprung from\r\nhorseback, waved his fatal sword over the head of his adversary, and\r\ncommanded him to yield himself; when Prince John, more moved by the\r\nTemplars dangerous situation than he had been by that of his rival,\r\nsaved him the mortification of confessing himself vanquished, by\r\ncasting down his warder, and putting an end to the conflict.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued\r\nto burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the\r\ngreater part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some\r\ntime, leaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.\r\n\r\nThe squires, who had found it a matter of danger and difficulty to\r\nattend their masters during the engagement, now thronged into the lists\r\nto pay their dutiful attendance to the wounded, who were removed with\r\nthe utmost care and attention to the neighbouring pavilions, or to the\r\nquarters prepared for them in the adjoining village.\r\n\r\nThus ended the memorable field of Ashby-de-la-Zouche, one of the most\r\ngallantly contested tournaments of that age; for although only four\r\nknights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had\r\ndied upon the field, yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded,\r\nfour or five of whom never recovered. Several more were disabled for\r\nlife; and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to\r\nthe grave with them. Hence it is always mentioned in the old records,\r\nas the Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms of Ashby.\r\n\r\nIt being now the duty of Prince John to name the knight who had done\r\nbest, he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight\r\nwhom the popular voice had termed \xe2\x80\x9cLe Noir Faineant.\xe2\x80\x9d It was pointed\r\nout to the Prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had\r\nbeen in fact won by the Disinherited Knight, who, in the course of the\r\nday, had overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally\r\nunhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. But Prince\r\nJohn adhered to his own opinion, on the ground that the Disinherited\r\nKnight and his party had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance\r\nof the Knight of the Black Armour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in\r\nawarding the prize.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was\r\nnowhere to be found. He had left the lists immediately when the\r\nconflict ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down\r\none of the forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and\r\nindifferent manner which had procured him the epithet of the Black\r\nSluggard. After he had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and\r\nproclamation of the heralds, it became necessary to name another to\r\nreceive the honours which had been assigned to him. Prince John had now\r\nno further excuse for resisting the claim of the Disinherited Knight,\r\nwhom, therefore, he named the champion of the day.\r\n\r\nThrough a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour\r\nand the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists\r\nagain conducted the victor to the foot of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s throne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisinherited Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9csince by that title only you\r\nwill consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the\r\nhonours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and\r\nreceive from the hands of the Queen of Love and Beauty, the Chaplet of\r\nHonour which your valour has justly deserved.\xe2\x80\x9d The Knight bowed low and\r\ngracefully, but returned no answer.\r\n\r\nWhile the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in\r\nproclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor\xe2\x80\x94while ladies\r\nwaved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks\r\njoined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the\r\nDisinherited Knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of\r\nhonour which was occupied by the Lady Rowena.\r\n\r\nOn the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down.\r\nIndeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to\r\nhave been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free\r\nwill; and it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the\r\nsecond time across the lists. Rowena, descending from her station with\r\na graceful and dignified step, was about to place the chaplet which she\r\nheld in her hand upon the helmet of the champion, when the marshals\r\nexclaimed with one voice, \xe2\x80\x9cIt must not be thus\xe2\x80\x94his head must be bare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe knight muttered faintly a few words, which were lost in the hollow\r\nof his helmet, but their purport seemed to be a desire that his casque\r\nmight not be removed.\r\n\r\nWhether from love of form, or from curiosity, the marshals paid no\r\nattention to his expressions of reluctance, but unhelmed him by cutting\r\nthe laces of his casque, and undoing the fastening of his gorget. When\r\nthe helmet was removed, the well-formed, yet sun-burnt features of a\r\nyoung man of twenty-five were seen, amidst a profusion of short fair\r\nhair. His countenance was as pale as death, and marked in one or two\r\nplaces with streaks of blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRowena had no sooner beheld him than she uttered a faint shriek; but at\r\nonce summoning up the energy of her disposition, and compelling\r\nherself, as it were, to proceed, while her frame yet trembled with the\r\nviolence of sudden emotion, she placed upon the drooping head of the\r\nvictor the splendid chaplet which was the destined reward of the day,\r\nand pronounced, in a clear and distinct tone, these words: \xe2\x80\x9cI bestow on\r\nthee this chaplet, Sir Knight, as the meed of valour assigned to this\r\nday\xe2\x80\x99s victor:\xe2\x80\x9d Here she paused a moment, and then firmly added, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nupon brows more worthy could a wreath of chivalry never be placed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight stooped his head, and kissed the hand of the lovely\r\nSovereign by whom his valour had been rewarded; and then, sinking yet\r\nfarther forward, lay prostrate at her feet.\r\n\r\nThere was a general consternation. Cedric, who had been struck mute by\r\nthe sudden appearance of his banished son, now rushed forward, as if to\r\nseparate him from Rowena. But this had been already accomplished by the\r\nmarshals of the field, who, guessing the cause of Ivanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s swoon, had\r\nhastened to undo his armour, and found that the head of a lance had\r\npenetrated his breastplate, and inflicted a wound in his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeroes, approach!\xe2\x80\x9d Atrides thus aloud,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand forth distinguish\xe2\x80\x99d from the circling crowd,\r\nYe who by skill or manly force may claim,\r\nYour rivals to surpass and merit fame.\r\nThis cow, worth twenty oxen, is decreed,\r\nFor him who farthest sends the winged reed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nILIAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Ivanhoe was no sooner pronounced than it flew from mouth to\r\nmouth, with all the celerity with which eagerness could convey and\r\ncuriosity receive it. It was not long ere it reached the circle of the\r\nPrince, whose brow darkened as he heard the news. Looking around him,\r\nhowever, with an air of scorn, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lords,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand especially\r\nyou, Sir Prior, what think ye of the doctrine the learned tell us,\r\nconcerning innate attractions and antipathies? Methinks that I felt the\r\npresence of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s minion, even when I least guessed whom yonder\r\nsuit of armour enclosed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf must prepare to restore his fief of Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said De\r\nBracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament,\r\nhad laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s retinue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Waldemar Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cthis gallant is likely to reclaim\r\nthe castle and manor which Richard assigned to him, and which your\r\nHighness\xe2\x80\x99s generosity has since given to Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d replied John, \xe2\x80\x9cis a man more willing to swallow three\r\nmanors such as Ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. For the rest,\r\nsirs, I hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the\r\ncrown upon the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to\r\nperform the usual military service, in the room of those who have\r\nwandered to foreign Countries, and can neither render homage nor\r\nservice when called upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe audience were too much interested in the question not to pronounce\r\nthe Prince\xe2\x80\x99s assumed right altogether indubitable. \xe2\x80\x9cA generous\r\nPrince!\xe2\x80\x94a most noble Lord, who thus takes upon himself the task of\r\nrewarding his faithful followers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch were the words which burst from the train, expectants all of them\r\nof similar grants at the expense of King Richard\xe2\x80\x99s followers and\r\nfavourites, if indeed they had not as yet received such. Prior Aymer\r\nalso assented to the general proposition, observing, however, \xe2\x80\x9cThat the\r\nblessed Jerusalem could not indeed be termed a foreign country. She was\r\n\xe2\x80\x98communis mater\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the mother of all Christians. But he saw not,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ndeclared, \xe2\x80\x9chow the Knight of Ivanhoe could plead any advantage from\r\nthis, since he\xe2\x80\x9d (the Prior) \xe2\x80\x9cwas assured that the crusaders, under\r\nRichard, had never proceeded much farther than Askalon, which, as all\r\nthe world knew, was a town of the Philistines, and entitled to none of\r\nthe privileges of the Holy City.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where Ivanhoe\r\nhad fallen to the ground, now returned. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gallant,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nlikely to give your Highness little disturbance, and to leave\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf in the quiet possession of his gains\xe2\x80\x94he is severely\r\nwounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever becomes of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9che is victor of the day;\r\nand were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother,\r\nwhich is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to\xe2\x80\x94our own\r\nphysician shall attend him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stern smile curled the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s lip as he spoke. Waldemar Fitzurse\r\nhastened to reply, that Ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and\r\nin the custody of his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was somewhat afflicted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the grief of the Queen of\r\nLove and Beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into\r\nmourning. I am not a man to be moved by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s lament for her lover,\r\nbut this same Lady Rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of\r\nmanner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her\r\ntearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form\r\nbefore her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cof whom we have heard so\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Saxon heiress of large possessions,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Prior Aymer; \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nrose of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a\r\nthousand, a bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall cheer her sorrows,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cand amend her blood,\r\nby wedding her to a Norman. She seems a minor, and must therefore be at\r\nour royal disposal in marriage.\xe2\x80\x94How sayst thou, De Bracy? What thinkst\r\nthou of gaining fair lands and livings, by wedding a Saxon, after the\r\nfashion of the followers of the Conqueror?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the lands are to my liking, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cit will\r\nbe hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will I hold myself\r\nbound to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises\r\nmade in favour of your servant and vassal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John; \xe2\x80\x9cand that we may instantly\r\ngo to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of\r\nthe Lady Rowena and her company\xe2\x80\x94that is, the rude churl her guardian,\r\nand the Saxon ox whom the Black Knight struck down in the tournament,\r\nupon this evening\xe2\x80\x99s banquet.\xe2\x80\x94De Bigot,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to his seneschal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthou wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify\r\nthe pride of these Saxons, and make it impossible for them again to\r\nrefuse; although, by the bones of Becket, courtesy to them is casting\r\npearls before swine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal\r\nfor retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whence?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, looking at the person by whom it was\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom foreign parts, my lord, but from whence I know not\xe2\x80\x9d replied his\r\nattendant. \xe2\x80\x9cA Frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden\r\nnight and day to put it into the hands of your highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the seal,\r\nplaced so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was\r\nsurrounded, and which bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis. John\r\nthen opened the billet with apparent agitation, which visibly and\r\ngreatly increased when he had perused the contents, which were\r\nexpressed in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Take heed to yourself for the Devil is unchained!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and then\r\nup to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of\r\nexecution has been passed upon him. Recovering from the first effects\r\nof his surprise, he took Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy aside, and put\r\nthe billet into their hands successively. \xe2\x80\x9cIt means,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a\r\nfaltering voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my brother Richard has obtained his freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is France\xe2\x80\x99s own hand and seal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince John.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cto draw our party to a head, either\r\nat York, or some other centrical place. A few days later, and it will\r\nbe indeed too late. Your highness must break short this present\r\nmummery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe yeomen and commons,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cmust not be dismissed\r\ndiscontented, for lack of their share in the sports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar, \xe2\x80\x9cis not yet very far spent\xe2\x80\x94let the archers\r\nshoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged. This will\r\nbe an abundant fulfilment of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s promises, so far as this herd\r\nof Saxon serfs is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank thee, Waldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cthou remindest me, too,\r\nthat I have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday\r\ninsulted our person. Our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we\r\nproposed. Were this my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred\r\nto revenge and to pleasure\xe2\x80\x94let new cares come with to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had\r\nalready begun to leave the field; and proclamation was made that Prince\r\nJohn, suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held\r\nhimself obliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfestival: Nevertheless, that, unwilling so many good yeoman should\r\ndepart without a trial of skill, he was pleased to appoint them, before\r\nleaving the ground, presently to execute the competition of archery\r\nintended for the morrow. To the best archer a prize was to be awarded,\r\nbeing a bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly\r\nornamented with a medallion of St Hubert, the patron of silvan sport.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty yeomen at first presented themselves as competitors,\r\nseveral of whom were rangers and under-keepers in the royal forests of\r\nNeedwood and Charnwood. When, however, the archers understood with whom\r\nthey were to be matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the\r\ncontest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat.\r\nFor in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well\r\nknown for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at\r\nNewmarket are familiar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.\r\n\r\nThe diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to\r\neight. Prince John stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the\r\npersons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery.\r\nHaving satisfied his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the\r\nobject of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot,\r\nand with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the\r\npreceding day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cI guessed by thy insolent babble that thou\r\nwert no true lover of the longbow, and I see thou darest not adventure\r\nthy skill among such merry-men as stand yonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder favour, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have another reason for\r\nrefraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is thy other reason?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, who, for some cause\r\nwhich perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful\r\ncuriosity respecting this individual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the woodsman, \xe2\x80\x9cI know not if these yeomen and I are\r\nused to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, I know not how\r\nyour Grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has\r\nunwittingly fallen under your displeasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John coloured as he put the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is thy name,\r\nyeoman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLocksley,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the yeoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Locksley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt shoot in thy turn, when\r\nthese yeomen have displayed their skill. If thou carriest the prize, I\r\nwill add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt be\r\nstript of thy Lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with\r\nbowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how if I refuse to shoot on such a wager?\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed\r\neasily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to bend or to draw my\r\nbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou refusest my fair proffer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Provost of\r\nthe lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and expel\r\nthee from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no fair chance you put on me, proud Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto compel me to peril myself against the best archers of Leicester and\r\nStaffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me.\r\nNevertheless, I will obey your pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook to him close, men-at-arms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9chis heart is\r\nsinking; I am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.\xe2\x80\x94And do you,\r\ngood fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready\r\nfor your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led\r\nto the lists. The contending archers took their station in turn, at the\r\nbottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and\r\nthe mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rovers.\r\nThe archers, having previously determined by lot their order of\r\nprecedence, were to shoot each three shafts in succession. The sports\r\nwere regulated by an officer of inferior rank, termed the Provost of\r\nthe Games; for the high rank of the marshals of the lists would have\r\nbeen held degraded, had they condescended to superintend the sports of\r\nthe yeomanry.\r\n\r\nOne by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts\r\nyeomanlike and bravely. Of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession, ten\r\nwere fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that,\r\nconsidering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. Of\r\nthe ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were\r\nshot by Hubert, a forester in the service of Malvoisin, who was\r\naccordingly pronounced victorious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Locksley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John to the bold yeoman, with a bitter\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cwilt thou try conclusions with Hubert, or wilt thou yield up\r\nbow, baldric, and quiver, to the Provost of the sports?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSith it be no better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cI am content to try my fortune;\r\non condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of\r\nHubert\xe2\x80\x99s, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall\r\npropose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is but fair,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cand it shall not be refused\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x94If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the bugle\r\nwith silver-pennies for thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man can do but his best,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Hubert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my grandsire drew a\r\ngood long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size\r\nplaced in its room. Hubert, who, as victor in the first trial of skill,\r\nhad the right to shoot first, took his aim with great deliberation,\r\nlong measuring the distance with his eye, while he held in his hand his\r\nbended bow, with the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a\r\nstep forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm,\r\ntill the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he drew\r\nhis bowstring to his ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and\r\nlighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not allowed for the wind, Hubert,\xe2\x80\x9d said his antagonist,\r\nbending his bow, \xe2\x80\x9cor that had been a better shot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim,\r\nLocksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as\r\ncarelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He\r\nwas speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring,\r\nyet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which\r\nmarked the centre than that of Hubert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the light of heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John to Hubert, \xe2\x80\x9can thou suffer\r\nthat runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHubert had but one set speech for all occasions. \xe2\x80\x9cAn your highness were\r\nto hang me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca man can but do his best. Nevertheless, my\r\ngrandsire drew a good bow\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nJohn, \xe2\x80\x9cshoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for\r\nthee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the caution\r\nwhich he had received from his adversary, he made the necessary\r\nallowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, and shot\r\nso successfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Hubert! a Hubert!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the populace, more interested in a known\r\nperson than in a stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the clout!\xe2\x80\x94in the clout!\xe2\x80\x94a Hubert for\r\never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou canst not mend that shot, Locksley,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, with an\r\ninsulting smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will notch his shaft for him, however,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Locksley.\r\n\r\nAnd letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it\r\nlighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers.\r\nThe people who stood around were so astonished at his wonderful\r\ndexterity, that they could not even give vent to their surprise in\r\ntheir usual clamour. \xe2\x80\x9cThis must be the devil, and no man of flesh and\r\nblood,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the yeomen to each other; \xe2\x80\x9csuch archery was never\r\nseen since a bow was first bent in Britain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cI will crave your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s permission to\r\nplant such a mark as is used in the North Country; and welcome every\r\nbrave yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny\r\nlass he loves best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then turned to leave the lists. \xe2\x80\x9cLet your guards attend me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cif you please\xe2\x80\x94I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John made a signal that some attendants should follow him in\r\ncase of his escape: but the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cShame! shame!\xe2\x80\x9d which burst from the\r\nmultitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.\r\n\r\nLocksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in\r\nlength, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man\xe2\x80\x99s thumb. He\r\nbegan to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time,\r\nthat to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had\r\nhitherto been used, was to put shame upon his skill. \xe2\x80\x9cFor his own\r\npart,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand in the land where he was bred, men would as soon\r\ntake for their mark King Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s round-table, which held sixty knights\r\naround it. A child of seven years old,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmight hit yonder\r\ntarget with a headless shaft; but,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, walking deliberately to\r\nthe other end of the lists, and sticking the willow wand upright in the\r\nground, \xe2\x80\x9che that hits that rod at five-score yards, I call him an\r\narcher fit to bear both bow and quiver before a king, an it were the\r\nstout King Richard himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy grandsire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hubert, \xe2\x80\x9cdrew a good bow at the battle of\r\nHastings, and never shot at such a mark in his life\xe2\x80\x94and neither will I.\r\nIf this yeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers\xe2\x80\x94or rather,\r\nI yield to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill;\r\na man can but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to\r\nmiss. I might as well shoot at the edge of our parson\xe2\x80\x99s whittle, or at\r\na wheat straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I\r\ncan hardly see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCowardly dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSirrah Locksley, do thou shoot; but,\r\nif thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man ever did\r\nso. However it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of\r\nsuperior skill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my best, as Hubert says,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cno man can do\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked\r\nwith attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought\r\nwas no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two\r\nformer shots. He then took his aim with some deliberation, and the\r\nmultitude awaited the event in breathless silence. The archer\r\nvindicated their opinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod\r\nagainst which it was aimed. A jubilee of acclamations followed; and\r\neven Prince John, in admiration of Locksley\xe2\x80\x99s skill, lost for an\r\ninstant his dislike to his person. \xe2\x80\x9cThese twenty nobles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhich, with the bugle, thou hast fairly won, are thine own; we will\r\nmake them fifty, if thou wilt take livery and service with us as a\r\nyeoman of our body guard, and be near to our person. For never did so\r\nstrong a hand bend a bow, or so true an eye direct a shaft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, noble Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have vowed, that if\r\never I take service, it should be with your royal brother King Richard.\r\nThese twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave\r\na bow as his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the\r\ntrial, he would have hit the wand as well I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the\r\nstranger, and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed\r\nwith the crowd, and was seen no more.\r\n\r\nThe victorious archer would not perhaps have escaped John\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nso easily, had not that Prince had other subjects of anxious and more\r\nimportant meditation pressing upon his mind at that instant. He called\r\nupon his chamberlain as he gave the signal for retiring from the lists,\r\nand commanded him instantly to gallop to Ashby, and seek out Isaac the\r\nJew. \xe2\x80\x9cTell the dog,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto send me, before sun-down, two\r\nthousand crowns. He knows the security; but thou mayst show him this\r\nring for a token. The rest of the money must be paid at York within six\r\ndays. If he neglects, I will have the unbelieving villain\xe2\x80\x99s head. Look\r\nthat thou pass him not on the way; for the circumcised slave was\r\ndisplaying his stolen finery amongst us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Prince resumed his horse, and returned to Ashby, the\r\nwhole crowd breaking up and dispersing upon his retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn rough magnificence array\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nWhen ancient Chivalry display\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe pomp of her heroic games,\r\nAnd crested chiefs and tissued dames\r\nAssembled, at the clarion\xe2\x80\x99s call,\r\nIn some proud castle\xe2\x80\x99s high arch\xe2\x80\x99d hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince John held his high festival in the Castle of Ashby. This was not\r\nthe same building of which the stately ruins still interest the\r\ntraveller, and which was erected at a later period by the Lord\r\nHastings, High Chamberlain of England, one of the first victims of the\r\ntyranny of Richard the Third, and yet better known as one of\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s characters than by his historical fame. The castle and\r\ntown of Ashby, at this time, belonged to Roger de Quincy, Earl of\r\nWinchester, who, during the period of our history, was absent in the\r\nHoly Land. Prince John, in the meanwhile, occupied his castle, and\r\ndisposed of his domains without scruple; and seeking at present to\r\ndazzle men\xe2\x80\x99s eyes by his hospitality and magnificence, had given orders\r\nfor great preparations, in order to render the banquet as splendid as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe purveyors of the Prince, who exercised on this and other occasions\r\nthe full authority of royalty, had swept the country of all that could\r\nbe collected which was esteemed fit for their master\xe2\x80\x99s table. Guests\r\nalso were invited in great numbers; and in the necessity in which he\r\nthen found himself of courting popularity, Prince John had extended his\r\ninvitation to a few distinguished Saxon and Danish families, as well as\r\nto the Norman nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. However\r\ndespised and degraded on ordinary occasions, the great numbers of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons must necessarily render them formidable in the civil\r\ncommotions which seemed approaching, and it was an obvious point of\r\npolicy to secure popularity with their leaders.\r\n\r\nIt was accordingly the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s intention, which he for some time\r\nmaintained, to treat these unwonted guests with a courtesy to which\r\nthey had been little accustomed. But although no man with less scruple\r\nmade his ordinary habits and feelings bend to his interest, it was the\r\nmisfortune of this Prince, that his levity and petulance were\r\nperpetually breaking out, and undoing all that had been gained by his\r\nprevious dissimulation.\r\n\r\nOf this fickle temper he gave a memorable example in Ireland, when sent\r\nthither by his father, Henry the Second, with the purpose of buying\r\ngolden opinions of the inhabitants of that new and important\r\nacquisition to the English crown. Upon this occasion the Irish\r\nchieftains contended which should first offer to the young Prince their\r\nloyal homage and the kiss of peace. But, instead of receiving their\r\nsalutations with courtesy, John and his petulant attendants could not\r\nresist the temptation of pulling the long beards of the Irish\r\nchieftains; a conduct which, as might have been expected, was highly\r\nresented by these insulted dignitaries, and produced fatal consequences\r\nto the English domination in Ireland. It is necessary to keep these\r\ninconsistencies of John\xe2\x80\x99s character in view, that the reader may\r\nunderstand his conduct during the present evening.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler\r\nmoments, Prince John received Cedric and Athelstane with distinguished\r\ncourtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when\r\nthe indisposition of Rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for\r\nher not attending upon his gracious summons. Cedric and Athelstane were\r\nboth dressed in the ancient Saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome\r\nin itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials,\r\nwas so remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests,\r\nthat Prince John took great credit to himself with Waldemar Fitzurse\r\nfor refraining from laughter at a sight which the fashion of the day\r\nrendered ridiculous. Yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close\r\ntunic and long mantle of the Saxons was a more graceful, as well as a\r\nmore convenient dress, than the garb of the Normans, whose under\r\ngarment was a long doublet, so loose as to resemble a shirt or\r\nwaggoner\xe2\x80\x99s frock, covered by a cloak of scanty dimensions, neither fit\r\nto defend the wearer from cold or from rain, and the only purpose of\r\nwhich appeared to be to display as much fur, embroidery, and jewellery\r\nwork, as the ingenuity of the tailor could contrive to lay upon it. The\r\nEmperor Charlemagne, in whose reign they were first introduced, seems\r\nto have been very sensible of the inconveniences arising from the\r\nfashion of this garment. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto what purpose\r\nserve these abridged cloaks? If we are in bed they are no cover, on\r\nhorseback they are no protection from the wind and rain, and when\r\nseated, they do not guard our legs from the damp or the frost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks\r\ncontinued in fashion down to the time of which we treat, and\r\nparticularly among the princes of the House of Anjou. They were\r\ntherefore in universal use among Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s courtiers; and the long\r\nmantle, which formed the upper garment of the Saxons, was held in\r\nproportional derision.\r\n\r\nThe guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of\r\ngood cheer. The numerous cooks who attended on the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s progress,\r\nhaving exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary\r\nprovisions were served up, had succeeded almost as well as the modern\r\nprofessors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their\r\nnatural appearance. Besides these dishes of domestic origin, there were\r\nvarious delicacies brought from foreign parts, and a quantity of rich\r\npastry, as well as of the simnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were\r\nonly used at the tables of the highest nobility. The banquet was\r\ncrowned with the richest wines, both foreign and domestic.\r\n\r\nBut, though luxurious, the Norman nobles were not generally speaking an\r\nintemperate race. While indulging themselves in the pleasures of the\r\ntable, they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to\r\nattribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquished Saxons, as vices\r\npeculiar to their inferior station. Prince John, indeed, and those who\r\ncourted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were apt to indulge to\r\nexcess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it\r\nis well known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches\r\nand new ale. His conduct, however, was an exception to the general\r\nmanners of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nWith sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the\r\nNorman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of Athelstane and\r\nCedric at a banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were\r\nunaccustomed. And while their manners were thus the subject of\r\nsarcastic observation, the untaught Saxons unwittingly transgressed\r\nseveral of the arbitrary rules established for the regulation of\r\nsociety. Now, it is well known, that a man may with more impunity be\r\nguilty of an actual breach either of real good breeding or of good\r\nmorals, than appear ignorant of the most minute point of fashionable\r\netiquette. Thus Cedric, who dried his hands with a towel, instead of\r\nsuffering the moisture to exhale by waving them gracefully in the air,\r\nincurred more ridicule than his companion Athelstane, when he swallowed\r\nto his own single share the whole of a large pasty composed of the most\r\nexquisite foreign delicacies, and termed at that time a \xe2\x80\x9cKarum-Pie\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\nWhen, however, it was discovered, by a serious cross-examination, that\r\nthe Thane of Coningsburgh (or Franklin, as the Normans termed him) had\r\nno idea what he had been devouring, and that he had taken the contents\r\nof the Karum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas they were in fact\r\nbeccaficoes and nightingales, his ignorance brought him in for an ample\r\nshare of the ridicule which would have been more justly bestowed on his\r\ngluttony.\r\n\r\nThe long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated\r\nfreely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\nunknown victor in the archery games, of the Black Knight, whose\r\nself-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had\r\nwon,\xe2\x80\x94and of the gallant Ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours\r\nof the day. The topics were treated with military frankness, and the\r\njest and laugh went round the hall. The brow of Prince John alone was\r\noverclouded during these discussions; some overpowering care seemed\r\nagitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints\r\nfrom his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was\r\npassing around him. On such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of\r\nwine as if to raise his spirits, and then mingle in the conversation by\r\nsome observation made abruptly or at random.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe drink this beaker,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto the health of Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\r\nchampion of this Passage of Arms, and grieve that his wound renders him\r\nabsent from our board\xe2\x80\x94Let all fill to the pledge, and especially Cedric\r\nof Rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric, standing up, and placing on the table\r\nhis untasted cup, \xe2\x80\x9cI yield not the name of son to the disobedient\r\nyouth, who at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners\r\nand customs of his fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Prince John, with well-feigned astonishment,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedient son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cso it is with this Wilfred. He left\r\nmy homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourt, where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you\r\nprize so highly. He left it contrary to my wish and command; and in the\r\ndays of Alfred that would have been termed disobedience\xe2\x80\x94ay, and a crime\r\nseverely punishable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince John, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it need not be\r\nenquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial\r\ndisobedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus spake Prince John, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of\r\nHenry the Second, though no one was free from the charge, he himself\r\nhad been most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my brother proposed\r\nto confer upon his favourite the rich manor of Ivanhoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did endow him with it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cnor is it my least\r\nquarrel with my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal, the\r\nvery domains which his fathers possessed in free and independent\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall then have your willing sanction, good Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\r\nJohn, \xe2\x80\x9cto confer this fief upon a person whose dignity will not be\r\ndiminished by holding land of the British crown.\xe2\x80\x94Sir Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning towards that Baron, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust you will\r\nso keep the goodly Barony of Ivanhoe, that Sir Wilfred shall not incur\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s farther displeasure by again entering upon that fief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St Anthony!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the black-brow\xe2\x80\x99d giant, \xe2\x80\x9cI will consent that\r\nyour highness shall hold me a Saxon, if either Cedric or Wilfred, or\r\nthe best that ever bore English blood, shall wrench from me the gift\r\nwith which your highness has graced me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever shall call thee Saxon, Sir Baron,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric, offended at\r\na mode of expression by which the Normans frequently expressed their\r\nhabitual contempt of the English, \xe2\x80\x9cwill do thee an honour as great as\r\nit is undeserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf would have replied, but Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s petulance and\r\nlevity got the start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said be, \xe2\x80\x9cmy lords, the noble Cedric speaks truth; and his\r\nrace may claim precedence over us as much in the length of their\r\npedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey go before us indeed in the field\xe2\x80\x94as deer before dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMalvoisin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with good right may they go before us\xe2\x80\x94forget not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior\r\nAymer, \xe2\x80\x9cthe superior decency and decorum of their manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir singular abstemiousness and temperance,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy,\r\nforgetting the plan which promised him a Saxon bride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTogether with the courage and conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cby which they distinguished themselves at Hastings and elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn,\r\nfollowed their Prince\xe2\x80\x99s example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at\r\nCedric, the face of the Saxon became inflamed with passion, and he\r\nglanced his eyes fiercely from one to another, as if the quick\r\nsuccession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in\r\nturn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, is at\r\na loss to choose from among them the immediate object of his revenge.\r\nAt length he spoke, in a voice half choked with passion; and,\r\naddressing himself to Prince John as the head and front of the offence\r\nwhich he had received, \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chave been the follies and\r\nvices of our race, a Saxon would have been held \xe2\x80\x98nidering\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d 21 (the\r\nmost emphatic term for abject worthlessness,) \xe2\x80\x9cwho should in his own\r\nhall, and while his own wine-cup passed, have treated, or suffered to\r\nbe treated, an unoffending guest as your highness has this day beheld\r\nme used; and whatever was the misfortune of our fathers on the field of\r\nHastings, those may at least be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d here he looked at\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf and the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cwho have within these few hours once\r\nand again lost saddle and stirrup before the lance of a Saxon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith, a biting jest!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John. \xe2\x80\x9cHow like you it,\r\nsirs?\xe2\x80\x94Our Saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; become shrewd in\r\nwit, and bold in bearing, in these unsettled times\xe2\x80\x94What say ye, my\r\nlords?\xe2\x80\x94By this good light, I hold it best to take our galleys, and\r\nreturn to Normandy in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor fear of the Saxons?\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cwe should need no\r\nweapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA truce with your raillery, Sir Knights,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand it were\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing the Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your highness should\r\nassure the worthy Cedric there is no insult intended him by jests,\r\nwhich must sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInsult?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince John, resuming his courtesy of demeanour; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntrust it will not be thought that I could mean, or permit any, to be\r\noffered in my presence. Here! I fill my cup to Cedric himself, since he\r\nrefuses to pledge his son\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers,\r\nwhich, however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the Saxon\r\nthat had been designed. He was not naturally acute of perception, but\r\nthose too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that this\r\nflattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult.\r\nHe was silent, however, when the royal pledge again passed round, \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nSir Athelstane of Coningsburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by\r\ndraining a huge goblet in answer to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, who began to be warmed with the wine\r\nwhich he had drank, \xe2\x80\x9chaving done justice to our Saxon guests, we will\r\npray of them some requital to our courtesy.\xe2\x80\x94Worthy Thane,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued, addressing Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cmay we pray you to name to us some\r\nNorman whose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with\r\na goblet of wine all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFitzurse arose while Prince John spoke, and gliding behind the seat of\r\nthe Saxon, whispered to him not to omit the opportunity of putting an\r\nend to unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming Prince John. The\r\nSaxon replied not to this politic insinuation, but, rising up, and\r\nfilling his cup to the brim, he addressed Prince John in these words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour highness has required that I should name a Norman deserving to be\r\nremembered at our banquet. This, perchance, is a hard task, since it\r\ncalls on the slave to sing the praises of the master\xe2\x80\x94upon the\r\nvanquished, while pressed by all the evils of conquest, to sing the\r\npraises of the conqueror. Yet I will name a Norman\xe2\x80\x94the first in arms\r\nand in place\xe2\x80\x94the best and the noblest of his race. And the lips that\r\nshall refuse to pledge me to his well-earned fame, I term false and\r\ndishonoured, and will so maintain them with my life.\xe2\x80\x94I quaff this\r\ngoblet to the health of Richard the Lion-hearted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John, who had expected that his own name would have closed the\r\nSaxon\xe2\x80\x99s speech, started when that of his injured brother was so\r\nunexpectedly introduced. He raised mechanically the wine-cup to his\r\nlips, then instantly set it down, to view the demeanour of the company\r\nat this unexpected proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe to\r\noppose as to comply with. Some of them, ancient and experienced\r\ncourtiers, closely imitated the example of the Prince himself, raising\r\nthe goblet to their lips, and again replacing it before them. There\r\nwere many who, with a more generous feeling, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cLong live King\r\nRichard! and may he be speedily restored to us!\xe2\x80\x9d And some few, among\r\nwhom were Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and the Templar, in sullen disdain suffered\r\ntheir goblets to stand untasted before them. But no man ventured\r\ndirectly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, Cedric said to his\r\ncompanion, \xe2\x80\x9cUp, noble Athelstane! we have remained here long enough,\r\nsince we have requited the hospitable courtesy of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbanquet. Those who wish to know further of our rude Saxon manners must\r\nhenceforth seek us in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen\r\nenough of royal banquets, and enough of Norman courtesy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by\r\nAthelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the Saxon\r\nlineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of Prince John and\r\nhis courtiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the bones of St Thomas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, as they retreated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nSaxon churls have borne off the best of the day, and have retreated\r\nwith triumph!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Conclamatum est, poculatum est\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prior Aymer; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have drunk\r\nand we have shouted,\xe2\x80\x94it were time we left our wine flagons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe monk hath some fair penitent to shrive to-night, that he is in\r\nsuch a hurry to depart,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Abbot; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must move several miles\r\nforward this evening upon my homeward journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are breaking up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince in a whisper to Fitzurse;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctheir fears anticipate the event, and this coward Prior is the first\r\nto shrink from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear not, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar; \xe2\x80\x9cI will show him such reasons as\r\nshall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at York.\xe2\x80\x94Sir\r\nPrior,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must speak with you in private, before you mount\r\nyour palfrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those\r\nimmediately attached to Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s faction, and his retinue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, then, is the result of your advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, turning an\r\nangry countenance upon Fitzurse; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should be bearded at my own\r\nboard by a drunken Saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s name, men should fall off from me as if I had the leprosy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave patience, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied his counsellor; \xe2\x80\x9cI might retort your\r\naccusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my design,\r\nand misled your own better judgment. But this is no time for\r\nrecrimination. De Bracy and I will instantly go among these shuffling\r\ncowards, and convince them they have gone too far to recede.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, pacing the apartment with\r\ndisordered steps, and expressing himself with an agitation to which the\r\nwine he had drank partly contributed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be in vain\xe2\x80\x94they have seen\r\nthe handwriting on the wall\xe2\x80\x94they have marked the paw of the lion in the\r\nsand\xe2\x80\x94they have heard his approaching roar shake the wood\xe2\x80\x94nothing will\r\nreanimate their courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould to God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse to De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat aught could reanimate\r\nhis own! His brother\xe2\x80\x99s very name is an ague to him. Unhappy are the\r\ncounsellors of a Prince, who wants fortitude and perseverance alike in\r\ngood and in evil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet he thinks,\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha, ha, ha,\xe2\x80\x94he thinks\r\nI am the tool and servant of his will.\r\nWell, let it be; through all the maze of trouble\r\nHis plots and base oppression must create,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll shape myself a way to higher things,\r\nAnd who will say \xe2\x80\x99tis wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIL, A TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his\r\nweb, than did Waldemar Fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered\r\nmembers of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s cabal. Few of these were attached to him from\r\ninclination, and none from personal regard. It was therefore necessary,\r\nthat Fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and\r\nremind them of those which they at present enjoyed. To the young and\r\nwild nobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and\r\nuncontrolled revelry; to the ambitious, that of power, and to the\r\ncovetous, that of increased wealth and extended domains. The leaders of\r\nthe mercenaries received a donation in gold; an argument the most\r\npersuasive to their minds, and without which all others would have\r\nproved in vain. Promises were still more liberally distributed than\r\nmoney by this active agent; and, in fine, nothing was left undone that\r\ncould determine the wavering, or animate the disheartened. The return\r\nof King Richard he spoke of as an event altogether beyond the reach of\r\nprobability; yet, when he observed, from the doubtful looks and\r\nuncertain answers which he received, that this was the apprehension by\r\nwhich the minds of his accomplices were most haunted, he boldly treated\r\nthat event, should it really take place, as one which ought not to\r\nalter their political calculations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Richard returns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9che returns to enrich his needy\r\nand impoverished crusaders at the expense of those who did not follow\r\nhim to the Holy Land. He returns to call to a fearful reckoning, those\r\nwho, during his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence\r\nor encroachment upon either the laws of the land or the privileges of\r\nthe crown. He returns to avenge upon the Orders of the Temple and the\r\nHospital, the preference which they showed to Philip of France during\r\nthe wars in the Holy Land. He returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel\r\nevery adherent of his brother Prince John. Are ye afraid of his power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the artful confident of that Prince, \xe2\x80\x9cwe acknowledge him a\r\nstrong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of King Arthur,\r\nwhen a champion could encounter an army. If Richard indeed comes back,\r\nit must be alone,\xe2\x80\x94unfollowed\xe2\x80\x94unfriended. The bones of his gallant army\r\nhave whitened the sands of Palestine. The few of his followers who have\r\nreturned have straggled hither like this Wilfred of Ivanhoe, beggared\r\nand broken men.\xe2\x80\x94And what talk ye of Richard\xe2\x80\x99s right of birth?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nproceeded, in answer to those who objected scruples on that head. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nRichard\xe2\x80\x99s title of primogeniture more decidedly certain than that of\r\nDuke Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son? And yet William\r\nthe Red, and Henry, his second and third brothers, were successively\r\npreferred to him by the voice of the nation, Robert had every merit\r\nwhich can be pleaded for Richard; he was a bold knight, a good leader,\r\ngenerous to his friends and to the church, and, to crown the whole, a\r\ncrusader and a conqueror of the Holy Sepulchre; and yet he died a blind\r\nand miserable prisoner in the Castle of Cardiff, because he opposed\r\nhimself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not rule\r\nover them. It is our right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto choose from the blood royal\r\nthe prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme power\xe2\x80\x94that is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, correcting himself, \xe2\x80\x9chim whose election will best promote the\r\ninterests of the nobility. In personal qualifications,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwas possible that Prince John might be inferior to his brother Richard;\r\nbut when it was considered that the latter returned with the sword of\r\nvengeance in his hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities,\r\nprivileges, wealth, and honours, it could not be doubted which was the\r\nking whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with\r\nthe nobles of Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s faction. Most of them consented to attend\r\nthe proposed meeting at York, for the purpose of making general\r\narrangements for placing the crown upon the head of Prince John.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various\r\nexertions, however gratified with the result, Fitzurse, returning to\r\nthe Castle of Ashby, met with De Bracy, who had exchanged his\r\nbanqueting garments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the same\r\ncloth and colour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn\r\nslung over his shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle of arrows\r\nstuck in his belt. Had Fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment,\r\nhe would have passed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the\r\nguard; but finding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more\r\nattention, and recognised the Norman knight in the dress of an English\r\nyeoman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mummery is this, De Bracy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, somewhat angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthis a time for Christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate of\r\nour master, Prince John, is on the very verge of decision? Why hast\r\nthou not been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very\r\nname of King Richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the\r\nSaracens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been attending to mine own business,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy calmly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas you, Fitzurse, have been minding yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI minding mine own business!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Waldemar; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been engaged in\r\nthat of Prince John, our joint patron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if thou hadst any other reason for that, Waldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthan the promotion of thine own individual interest? Come, Fitzurse,\r\nwe know each other\xe2\x80\x94ambition is thy pursuit, pleasure is mine, and they\r\nbecome our different ages. Of Prince John thou thinkest as I do; that\r\nhe is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy\r\nmonarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too\r\nfickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. But he is a monarch\r\nby whom Fitzurse and De Bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore\r\nyou aid him with your policy, and I with the lances of my Free\r\nCompanions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hopeful auxiliary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cplaying the fool in\r\nthe very moment of utter necessity.\xe2\x80\x94What on earth dost thou purpose by\r\nthis absurd disguise at a moment so urgent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get me a wife,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cafter the manner of the\r\ntribe of Benjamin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tribe of Benjamin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse; \xe2\x80\x9cI comprehend thee not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWert thou not in presence yester-even,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we heard\r\nthe Prior Aymer tell us a tale in reply to the romance which was sung\r\nby the Minstrel?\xe2\x80\x94He told how, long since in Palestine, a deadly feud\r\narose between the tribe of Benjamin and the rest of the Israelitish\r\nnation; and how they cut to pieces well-nigh all the chivalry of that\r\ntribe; and how they swore by our blessed Lady, that they would not\r\npermit those who remained to marry in their lineage; and how they\r\nbecame grieved for their vow, and sent to consult his holiness the Pope\r\nhow they might be absolved from it; and how, by the advice of the Holy\r\nFather, the youth of the tribe of Benjamin carried off from a superb\r\ntournament all the ladies who were there present, and thus won them\r\nwives without the consent either of their brides or their brides\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfamilies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard the story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cthough either the Prior or\r\nthou has made some singular alterations in date and circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I mean to purvey me a wife after\r\nthe fashion of the tribe of Benjamin; which is as much as to say, that\r\nin this same equipment I will fall upon that herd of Saxon bullocks,\r\nwho have this night left the castle, and carry off from them the lovely\r\nRowena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou mad, De Bracy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse. \xe2\x80\x9cBethink thee that, though the\r\nmen be Saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the more\r\nrespect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of\r\nfew of Saxon descent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd should belong to none,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cthe work of the Conquest\r\nshould be completed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no time for it at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse \xe2\x80\x9cthe approaching\r\ncrisis renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and Prince\r\nJohn cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him grant it, if he dare,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9che will soon see the\r\ndifference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine,\r\nand that of a heartless mob of Saxon churls. Yet I mean no immediate\r\ndiscovery of myself. Seem I not in this garb as bold a forester as ever\r\nblew horn? The blame of the violence shall rest with the outlaws of the\r\nYorkshire forests. I have sure spies on the Saxon\xe2\x80\x99s motions\xe2\x80\x94To-night\r\nthey sleep in the convent of Saint Wittol, or Withold, or whatever they\r\ncall that churl of a Saxon Saint at Burton-on-Trent. Next day\xe2\x80\x99s march\r\nbrings them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them at\r\nonce. Presently after I will appear in mine own shape, play the\r\ncourteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from\r\nthe hands of the rude ravishers, conduct her to Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s Castle,\r\nor to Normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to\r\nher kindred until she be the bride and dame of Maurice de Bracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA marvellously sage plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cand, as I think, not\r\nentirely of thine own device.\xe2\x80\x94Come, be frank, De Bracy, who aided thee\r\nin the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as I\r\nthink, thine own band lies as far off as York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, if thou must needs know,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cit was the Templar\r\nBrian de Bois-Guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the\r\nadventure of the men of Benjamin suggested to me. He is to aid me in\r\nthe onslaught, and he and his followers will personate the outlaws,\r\nfrom whom my valorous arm is, after changing my garb, to rescue the\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my halidome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan was worthy of your united\r\nwisdom! and thy prudence, De Bracy, is most especially manifested in\r\nthe project of leaving the lady in the hands of thy worthy confederate.\r\nThou mayst, I think, succeed in taking her from her Saxon friends, but\r\nhow thou wilt rescue her afterwards from the clutches of Bois-Guilbert\r\nseems considerably more doubtful\xe2\x80\x94He is a falcon well accustomed to\r\npounce on a partridge, and to hold his prey fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Templar,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cand cannot therefore rival me in my\r\nplan of wedding this heiress;\xe2\x80\x94and to attempt aught dishonourable\r\nagainst the intended bride of De Bracy\xe2\x80\x94By Heaven! were he a whole\r\nChapter of his Order in his single person, he dared not do me such an\r\ninjury!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen since nought that I can say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cwill put this folly\r\nfrom thy imagination, (for well I know the obstinacy of thy\r\ndisposition,) at least waste as little time as possible\xe2\x80\x94let not thy\r\nfolly be lasting as well as untimely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it will be the work of a few\r\nhours, and I shall be at York\xe2\x80\x94at the head of my daring and valorous\r\nfellows, as ready to support any bold design as thy policy can be to\r\nform one.\xe2\x80\x94But I hear my comrades assembling, and the steeds stamping\r\nand neighing in the outer court.\xe2\x80\x94Farewell.\xe2\x80\x94I go, like a true knight, to\r\nwin the smiles of beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a true knight?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Fitzurse, looking after him; \xe2\x80\x9clike a\r\nfool, I should say, or like a child, who will leave the most serious\r\nand needful occupation, to chase the down of the thistle that drives\r\npast him.\xe2\x80\x94But it is with such tools that I must work;\xe2\x80\x94and for whose\r\nadvantage?\xe2\x80\x94For that of a Prince as unwise as he is profligate, and as\r\nlikely to be an ungrateful master as he has already proved a rebellious\r\nson and an unnatural brother.\xe2\x80\x94But he\xe2\x80\x94he, too, is but one of the tools\r\nwith which I labour; and, proud as he is, should he presume to separate\r\nhis interest from mine, this is a secret which he shall soon learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe meditations of the statesman were here interrupted by the voice of\r\nthe Prince from an interior apartment, calling out, \xe2\x80\x9cNoble Waldemar\r\nFitzurse!\xe2\x80\x9d and, with bonnet doffed, the future Chancellor (for to such\r\nhigh preferment did the wily Norman aspire) hastened to receive the\r\norders of the future sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nFar in a wild, unknown to public view,\r\nFrom youth to age a reverend hermit grew;\r\nThe moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,\r\nHis food the fruits, his drink the crystal well\r\nRemote from man, with God he pass\xe2\x80\x99d his days,\r\nPrayer all his business\xe2\x80\x94all his pleasure praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARNELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot have forgotten that the event of the tournament was\r\ndecided by the exertions of an unknown knight, whom, on account of the\r\npassive and indifferent conduct which he had manifested on the former\r\npart of the day, the spectators had entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cLe Noir Faineant\xe2\x80\x9d. This\r\nknight had left the field abruptly when the victory was achieved; and\r\nwhen he was called upon to receive the reward of his valour, he was\r\nnowhere to be found. In the meantime, while summoned by heralds and by\r\ntrumpets, the knight was holding his course northward, avoiding all\r\nfrequented paths, and taking the shortest road through the woodlands.\r\nHe paused for the night at a small hostelry lying out of the ordinary\r\nroute, where, however, he obtained from a wandering minstrel news of\r\nthe event of the tourney.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the knight departed early, with the intention of\r\nmaking a long journey; the condition of his horse, which he had\r\ncarefully spared during the preceding morning, being such as enabled\r\nhim to travel far without the necessity of much repose. Yet his purpose\r\nwas baffled by the devious paths through which he rode, so that when\r\nevening closed upon him, he only found himself on the frontiers of the\r\nWest Riding of Yorkshire. By this time both horse and man required\r\nrefreshment, and it became necessary, moreover, to look out for some\r\nplace in which they might spend the night, which was now fast\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nThe place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for\r\nobtaining either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to be\r\nreduced to the usual expedient of knights-errant, who, on such\r\noccasions, turned their horses to graze, and laid themselves down to\r\nmeditate on their lady-mistress, with an oak-tree for a canopy. But the\r\nBlack Knight either had no mistress to meditate upon, or, being as\r\nindifferent in love as he seemed to be in war, was not sufficiently\r\noccupied by passionate reflections upon her beauty and cruelty, to be\r\nable to parry the effects of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act\r\nas a substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper. He felt\r\ndissatisfied, therefore, when, looking around, he found himself deeply\r\ninvolved in woods, through which indeed there were many open glades,\r\nand some paths, but such as seemed only formed by the numerous herds of\r\ncattle which grazed in the forest, or by the animals of chase, and the\r\nhunters who made prey of them.\r\n\r\nThe sun, by which the knight had chiefly directed his course, had now\r\nsunk behind the Derbyshire hills on his left, and every effort which he\r\nmight make to pursue his journey was as likely to lead him out of his\r\nroad as to advance him on his route. After having in vain endeavoured\r\nto select the most beaten path, in hopes it might lead to the cottage\r\nof some herdsman, or the silvan lodge of a forester, and having\r\nrepeatedly found himself totally unable to determine on a choice, the\r\nknight resolved to trust to the sagacity of his horse; experience\r\nhaving, on former occasions, made him acquainted with the wonderful\r\ntalent possessed by these animals for extricating themselves and their\r\nriders on such emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe good steed, grievously fatigued with so long a day\xe2\x80\x99s journey under\r\na rider cased in mail, had no sooner found, by the slackened reins,\r\nthat he was abandoned to his own guidance, than he seemed to assume new\r\nstrength and spirit; and whereas, formerly he had scarce replied to the\r\nspur, otherwise than by a groan, he now, as if proud of the confidence\r\nreposed in him, pricked up his ears, and assumed, of his own accord, a\r\nmore lively motion. The path which the animal adopted rather turned off\r\nfrom the course pursued by the knight during the day; but as the horse\r\nseemed confident in his choice, the rider abandoned himself to his\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nHe was justified by the event; for the footpath soon after appeared a\r\nlittle wider and more worn, and the tinkle of a small bell gave the\r\nknight to understand that he was in the vicinity of some chapel or\r\nhermitage.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he soon reached an open plat of turf, on the opposite side\r\nof which, a rock, rising abruptly from a gently sloping plain, offered\r\nits grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its\r\nsides in some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots\r\nfound nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices\r\nbelow, like the plumage of the warrior over his steel helmet, giving\r\ngrace to that whose chief expression was terror. At the bottom of the\r\nrock, and leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut,\r\nbuilt chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest,\r\nand secured against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with\r\nmoss mingled with clay. The stem of a young fir-tree lopped of its\r\nbranches, with a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted\r\nupright by the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little\r\ndistance on the right hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out\r\nof the rock, and was received in a hollow stone, which labour had\r\nformed into a rustic basin. Escaping from thence, the stream murmured\r\ndown the descent by a channel which its course had long worn, and so\r\nwandered through the little plain to lose itself in the neighbouring\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nBeside this fountain were the ruins of a very small chapel, of which\r\nthe roof had partly fallen in. The building, when entire, had never\r\nbeen above sixteen feet long by twelve feet in breadth, and the roof,\r\nlow in proportion, rested upon four concentric arches which sprung from\r\nthe four corners of the building, each supported upon a short and heavy\r\npillar. The ribs of two of these arches remained, though the roof had\r\nfallen down betwixt them; over the others it remained entire. The\r\nentrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a very low round\r\narch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding,\r\nresembling shark\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, which appears so often in the more ancient\r\nSaxon architecture. A belfry rose above the porch on four small\r\npillars, within which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell, the feeble\r\nsounds of which had been some time before heard by the Black Knight.\r\n\r\nThe whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before\r\nthe eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the\r\nnight; since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in the\r\nwoods, to exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the\r\nparticulars which we have detailed, but thanking Saint Julian (the\r\npatron of travellers) who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from\r\nhis horse and assailed the door of the hermitage with the butt of his\r\nlance, in order to arouse attention and gain admittance.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when\r\nmade, was unpropitious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass on, whosoever thou art,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer given by a deep hoarse\r\nvoice from within the hut, \xe2\x80\x9cand disturb not the servant of God and St\r\nDunstan in his evening devotions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorthy father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the knight, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a poor wanderer\r\nbewildered in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity of exercising\r\nthy charity and hospitality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood brother,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, \xe2\x80\x9cit has\r\npleased Our Lady and St Dunstan to destine me for the object of those\r\nvirtues, instead of the exercise thereof. I have no provisions here\r\nwhich even a dog would share with me, and a horse of any tenderness of\r\nnurture would despise my couch\xe2\x80\x94pass therefore on thy way, and God speed\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cis it possible for me to find my way\r\nthrough such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on? I pray you,\r\nreverend father as you are a Christian, to undo your door, and at least\r\npoint out to me my road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I pray you, good Christian brother,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the anchorite, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ndisturb me no more. You have already interrupted one \xe2\x80\x98pater\xe2\x80\x99, two\r\n\xe2\x80\x98aves\xe2\x80\x99, and a \xe2\x80\x98credo\xe2\x80\x99, which I, miserable sinner that I am, should,\r\naccording to my vow, have said before moonrise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe road\xe2\x80\x94the road!\xe2\x80\x9d vociferated the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me directions for\r\nthe road, if I am to expect no more from thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe road,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cis easy to hit. The path from the wood\r\nleads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as the rains have\r\nabated, may now be passable. When thou hast crossed the ford, thou wilt\r\ntake care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat\r\nprecipitous; and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as I\r\nlearn, (for I seldom leave the duties of my chapel,) given way in\r\nsundry places. Thou wilt then keep straight forward\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA broken path\xe2\x80\x94a precipice\xe2\x80\x94a ford, and a morass!\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight\r\ninterrupting him,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSir Hermit, if you were the holiest that ever wore\r\nbeard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this road\r\nto-night. I tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charity of the\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x94ill deserved, as I doubt it is\xe2\x80\x94hast no right to refuse shelter\r\nto the wayfarer when in distress. Either open the door quickly, or, by\r\nthe rood, I will beat it down and make entry for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend wayfarer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cbe not importunate; if thou\r\nputtest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it will be\r\ne\xe2\x80\x99en the worse for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the\r\ntraveller had for some time heard, became extremely loud and furious,\r\nand made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of\r\nmaking forcible entry, had called the dogs who made this clamour to aid\r\nhim in his defence, out of some inner recess in which they had been\r\nkennelled. Incensed at this preparation on the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s part for making\r\ngood his inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously\r\nwith his foot, that posts as well as staples shook with violence.\r\n\r\nThe anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock,\r\nnow called out aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cPatience, patience\xe2\x80\x94spare thy strength, good\r\ntraveller, and I will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my\r\ndoing so will be little to thy pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door accordingly was opened; and the hermit, a large, strong-built\r\nman, in his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope of rushes, stood\r\nbefore the knight. He had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in\r\nthe other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well\r\nbe termed a club. Two large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff,\r\nstood ready to rush upon the traveller as soon as the door should be\r\nopened. But when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden\r\nspurs of the knight, who stood without, the hermit, altering probably\r\nhis original intentions, repressed the rage of his auxiliaries, and,\r\nchanging his tone to a sort of churlish courtesy, invited the knight to\r\nenter his hut, making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge\r\nafter sunset, by alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were\r\nabroad, and who gave no honour to Our Lady or St Dunstan, nor to those\r\nholy men who spent life in their service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poverty of your cell, good father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, looking\r\naround him, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a crucifix rudely\r\ncarved in oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and\r\none or two clumsy articles of furniture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe poverty of your cell\r\nshould seem a sufficient defence against any risk of thieves, not to\r\nmention the aid of two trusty dogs, large and strong enough, I think,\r\nto pull down a stag, and of course, to match with most men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good keeper of the forest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9chath allowed me the\r\nuse of these animals, to protect my solitude until the times shall\r\nmend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which\r\nserved for a candlestick; and, placing the oaken trivet before the\r\nembers of the fire, which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a\r\nstool upon one side of the table, and beckoned to the knight to do the\r\nsame upon the other.\r\n\r\nThey sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each\r\nthinking in his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more\r\nathletic figure than was placed opposite to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend hermit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, after looking long and fixedly at\r\nhis host, \xe2\x80\x9cwere it not to interrupt your devout meditations, I would\r\npray to know three things of your holiness; first, where I am to put my\r\nhorse?\xe2\x80\x94secondly, what I can have for supper?\xe2\x80\x94thirdly, where I am to\r\ntake up my couch for the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will reply to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cwith my finger, it being\r\nagainst my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSo saying, he pointed successively to two corners of the hut. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nstable,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis there\xe2\x80\x94your bed there; and,\xe2\x80\x9d reaching down a\r\nplatter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it from the\r\nneighbouring shelf, and placing it upon the table, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nsupper is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his\r\nhorse, (which in the interim he had fastened to a tree,) unsaddled him\r\nwith much attention, and spread upon the steed\xe2\x80\x99s weary back his own\r\nmantle.\r\n\r\nThe hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety\r\nas well as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse;\r\nfor, muttering something about provender left for the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s palfrey,\r\nhe dragged out of a recess a bundle of forage, which he spread before\r\nthe knight\xe2\x80\x99s charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity\r\nof dried fern in the corner which he had assigned for the rider\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncouch. The knight returned him thanks for his courtesy; and, this duty\r\ndone, both resumed their seats by the table, whereon stood the trencher\r\nof pease placed between them. The hermit, after a long grace, which had\r\nonce been Latin, but of which original language few traces remained,\r\nexcepting here and there the long rolling termination of some word or\r\nphrase, set example to his guest, by modestly putting into a very large\r\nmouth, furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a\r\nboar both in sharpness and whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a\r\nmiserable grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill.\r\n\r\nThe knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his\r\nhelmet, his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, and showed to\r\nthe hermit a head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue\r\neyes, remarkably bright and sparkling, a mouth well formed, having an\r\nupper lip clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair, and bearing\r\naltogether the look of a bold, daring, and enterprising man, with which\r\nhis strong form well corresponded.\r\n\r\nThe hermit, as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest,\r\nthrew back his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man\r\nin the prime of life. His close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle of\r\nstiff curled black hair, had something the appearance of a parish\r\npinfold begirt by its high hedge. The features expressed nothing of\r\nmonastic austerity, or of ascetic privations; on the contrary, it was a\r\nbold bluff countenance, with broad black eyebrows, a well-turned\r\nforehead, and cheeks as round and vermilion as those of a trumpeter,\r\nfrom which descended a long and curly black beard. Such a visage,\r\njoined to the brawny form of the holy man, spoke rather of sirloins and\r\nhaunches, than of pease and pulse. This incongruity did not escape the\r\nguest. After he had with great difficulty accomplished the mastication\r\nof a mouthful of the dried pease, he found it absolutely necessary to\r\nrequest his pious entertainer to furnish him with some liquor; who\r\nreplied to his request by placing before him a large can of the purest\r\nwater from the fountain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is from the well of St Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cin which, betwixt sun\r\nand sun, he baptized five hundred heathen Danes and Britons\xe2\x80\x94blessed be\r\nhis name!\xe2\x80\x9d And applying his black beard to the pitcher, he took a\r\ndraught much more moderate in quantity than his encomium seemed to\r\nwarrant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me, reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the small\r\nmorsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thin\r\nbeverage, have thriven with you marvellously. You appear a man more fit\r\nto win the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout at\r\nquarter-staff, or the bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your\r\ntime in this desolate wilderness, saying masses, and living upon\r\nparched pease and cold water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cyour thoughts, like those of the\r\nignorant laity, are according to the flesh. It has pleased Our Lady and\r\nmy patron saint to bless the pittance to which I restrain myself, even\r\nas the pulse and water was blessed to the children Shadrach, Meshech,\r\nand Abednego, who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the\r\nwine and meats which were appointed them by the King of the Saracens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cupon whose countenance it hath pleased\r\nHeaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman to crave thy\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou mayst call me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Clerk of Copmanhurst,\r\nfor so I am termed in these parts\xe2\x80\x94They add, it is true, the epithet\r\nholy, but I stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such\r\naddition.\xe2\x80\x94And now, valiant knight, may I pray ye for the name of my\r\nhonourable guest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cHoly Clerk of Copmanhurst, men call me in\r\nthese parts the Black Knight,\xe2\x80\x94many, sir, add to it the epithet of\r\nSluggard, whereby I am no way ambitious to be distinguished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guest\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Sluggish Knight, that thou art a man of prudence\r\nand of counsel; and moreover, I see that my poor monastic fare likes\r\nthee not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of\r\ncourts and of camps, and the luxuries of cities; and now I bethink me,\r\nSir Sluggard, that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left\r\nthose dogs for my protection, and also those bundles of forage, he left\r\nme also some food, which, being unfit for my use, the very recollection\r\nof it had escaped me amid my more weighty meditations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare be sworn he did so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cI was convinced that\r\nthere was better food in the cell, Holy Clerk, since you first doffed\r\nyour cowl.\xe2\x80\x94Your keeper is ever a jovial fellow; and none who beheld thy\r\ngrinders contending with these pease, and thy throat flooded with this\r\nungenial element, could see thee doomed to such horse-provender and\r\nhorse-beverage,\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to the provisions upon the table,) \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nrefrain from mending thy cheer. Let us see the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s bounty,\r\ntherefore, without delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hermit cast a wistful look upon the knight, in which there was a\r\nsort of comic expression of hesitation, as if uncertain how far he\r\nshould act prudently in trusting his guest. There was, however, as much\r\nof bold frankness in the knight\xe2\x80\x99s countenance as was possible to be\r\nexpressed by features. His smile, too, had something in it irresistibly\r\ncomic, and gave an assurance of faith and loyalty, with which his host\r\ncould not refrain from sympathizing.\r\n\r\nAfter exchanging a mute glance or two, the hermit went to the further\r\nside of the hut, and opened a hutch, which was concealed with great\r\ncare and some ingenuity. Out of the recesses of a dark closet, into\r\nwhich this aperture gave admittance, he brought a large pasty, baked in\r\na pewter platter of unusual dimensions. This mighty dish he placed\r\nbefore his guest, who, using his poniard to cut it open, lost no time\r\nin making himself acquainted with its contents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it since the good keeper has been here?\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight\r\nto his host, after having swallowed several hasty morsels of this\r\nreinforcement to the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s good cheer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout two months,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the father hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the true Lord,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cevery thing in your hermitage\r\nis miraculous, Holy Clerk! for I would have been sworn that the fat\r\nbuck which furnished this venison had been running on foot within the\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hermit was somewhat discountenanced by this observation; and,\r\nmoreover, he made but a poor figure while gazing on the diminution of\r\nthe pasty, on which his guest was making desperate inroads; a warfare\r\nin which his previous profession of abstinence left him no pretext for\r\njoining.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in Palestine, Sir Clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, stopping short\r\nof a sudden, \xe2\x80\x9cand I bethink me it is a custom there that every host who\r\nentertains a guest shall assure him of the wholesomeness of his food,\r\nby partaking of it along with him. Far be it from me to suspect so holy\r\na man of aught inhospitable; nevertheless I will be highly bound to you\r\nwould you comply with this Eastern custom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo ease your unnecessary scruples, Sir Knight, I will for once depart\r\nfrom my rule,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit. And as there were no forks in those\r\ndays, his clutches were instantly in the bowels of the pasty.\r\n\r\nThe ice of ceremony being once broken, it seemed matter of rivalry\r\nbetween the guest and the entertainer which should display the best\r\nappetite; and although the former had probably fasted longest, yet the\r\nhermit fairly surpassed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, when his hunger was appeased, \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\ngage my good horse yonder against a zecchin, that that same honest\r\nkeeper to whom we are obliged for the venison has left thee a stoup of\r\nwine, or a runlet of canary, or some such trifle, by way of ally to\r\nthis noble pasty. This would be a circumstance, doubtless, totally\r\nunworthy to dwell in the memory of so rigid an anchorite; yet, I think,\r\nwere you to search yonder crypt once more, you would find that I am\r\nright in my conjecture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hermit only replied by a grin; and returning to the hutch, he\r\nproduced a leathern bottle, which might contain about four quarts. He\r\nalso brought forth two large drinking cups, made out of the horn of the\r\nurus, and hooped with silver. Having made this goodly provision for\r\nwashing down the supper, he seemed to think no farther ceremonious\r\nscruple necessary on his part; but filling both cups, and saying, in\r\nthe Saxon fashion, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Waes hael\xe2\x80\x99, Sir Sluggish Knight!\xe2\x80\x9d he emptied his\r\nown at a draught.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Drink hael\xe2\x80\x99, Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the warrior, and\r\ndid his host reason in a similar brimmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, after the first cup was thus\r\nswallowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot but marvel that a man possessed of such thews and\r\nsinews as thine, and who therewithal shows the talent of so goodly a\r\ntrencher-man, should think of abiding by himself in this wilderness. In\r\nmy judgment, you are fitter to keep a castle or a fort, eating of the\r\nfat and drinking of the strong, than to live here upon pulse and water,\r\nor even upon the charity of the keeper. At least, were I as thou, I\r\nshould find myself both disport and plenty out of the king\xe2\x80\x99s deer.\r\nThere is many a goodly herd in these forests, and a buck will never be\r\nmissed that goes to the use of Saint Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s chaplain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Sluggish Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Clerk, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are dangerous words,\r\nand I pray you to forbear them. I am true hermit to the king and law,\r\nand were I to spoil my liege\xe2\x80\x99s game, I should be sure of the prison,\r\nand, an my gown saved me not, were in some peril of hanging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, were I as thou,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI would take my walk\r\nby moonlight, when foresters and keepers were warm in bed, and ever and\r\nanon,\xe2\x80\x94as I pattered my prayers,\xe2\x80\x94I would let fly a shaft among the herds\r\nof dun deer that feed in the glades\xe2\x80\x94Resolve me, Holy Clerk, hast thou\r\nnever practised such a pastime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Sluggard,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast seen all that can\r\nconcern thee of my housekeeping, and something more than he deserves\r\nwho takes up his quarters by violence. Credit me, it is better to enjoy\r\nthe good which God sends thee, than to be impertinently curious how it\r\ncomes. Fill thy cup, and welcome; and do not, I pray thee, by further\r\nimpertinent enquiries, put me to show that thou couldst hardly have\r\nmade good thy lodging had I been earnest to oppose thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou makest me more curious than ever!\r\nThou art the most mysterious hermit I ever met; and I will know more of\r\nthee ere we part. As for thy threats, know, holy man, thou speakest to\r\none whose trade it is to find out danger wherever it is to be met\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Sluggish Knight, I drink to thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit; \xe2\x80\x9crespecting\r\nthy valour much, but deeming wondrous slightly of thy discretion. If\r\nthou wilt take equal arms with me, I will give thee, in all friendship\r\nand brotherly love, such sufficing penance and complete absolution,\r\nthat thou shalt not for the next twelve months sin the sin of excess of\r\ncuriosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe knight pledged him, and desired him to name his weapons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is none,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the scissors of Delilah, and\r\nthe tenpenny nail of Jael, to the scimitar of Goliath, at which I am\r\nnot a match for thee\xe2\x80\x94But, if I am to make the election, what sayst\r\nthou, good friend, to these trinkets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he opened another hutch, and took out from it a couple\r\nof broadswords and bucklers, such as were used by the yeomanry of the\r\nperiod. The knight, who watched his motions, observed that this second\r\nplace of concealment was furnished with two or three good long-bows, a\r\ncross-bow, a bundle of bolts for the latter, and half-a-dozen sheaves\r\nof arrows for the former. A harp, and other matters of a very\r\nuncanonical appearance, were also visible when this dark recess was\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise thee, brother Clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI will ask thee no more\r\noffensive questions. The contents of that cupboard are an answer to all\r\nmy enquiries; and I see a weapon there\xe2\x80\x9d (here he stooped and took out\r\nthe harp) \xe2\x80\x9con which I would more gladly prove my skill with thee, than\r\nat the sword and buckler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast given no good reason\r\nfor thy surname of the Sluggard. I do promise thee I suspect thee\r\ngrievously. Nevertheless, thou art my guest, and I will not put thy\r\nmanhood to the proof without thine own free will. Sit thee down, then,\r\nand fill thy cup; let us drink, sing, and be merry. If thou knowest\r\never a good lay, thou shalt be welcome to a nook of pasty at\r\nCopmanhurst so long as I serve the chapel of St Dunstan, which, please\r\nGod, shall be till I change my grey covering for one of green turf. But\r\ncome, fill a flagon, for it will crave some time to tune the harp; and\r\nnought pitches the voice and sharpens the ear like a cup of wine. For\r\nmy part, I love to feel the grape at my very finger-ends before they\r\nmake the harp-strings tinkle.\xe2\x80\x9d 22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eve, within yon studious nook,\r\nI ope my brass-embossed book,\r\nPortray\xe2\x80\x99d with many a holy deed\r\nOf martyrs crown\xe2\x80\x99d with heavenly meed;\r\nThen, as my taper waxes dim,\r\nChant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.\r\n\r\nWho but would cast his pomp away,\r\nTo take my staff and amice grey,\r\nAnd to the world\xe2\x80\x99s tumultuous stage,\r\nPrefer the peaceful Hermitage?\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTON\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his\r\nguest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp\r\nto harmony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMethinks, holy father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe instrument wants one string, and\r\nthe rest have been somewhat misused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, mark\xe2\x80\x99st thou that?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit; \xe2\x80\x9cthat shows thee a master\r\nof the craft. Wine and wassail,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, gravely casting up his\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call the fault of wine and wassail!\xe2\x80\x94I told Allan-a-Dale, the\r\nnorthern minstrel, that he would damage the harp if he touched it after\r\nthe seventh cup, but he would not be controlled\xe2\x80\x94Friend, I drink to thy\r\nsuccessful performance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took off his cup with much gravity, at the same time\r\nshaking his head at the intemperance of the Scottish harper.\r\n\r\nThe knight in the meantime, had brought the strings into some order,\r\nand after a short prelude, asked his host whether he would choose a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csirvente\xe2\x80\x9d in the language of \xe2\x80\x9coc\xe2\x80\x9d, or a \xe2\x80\x9clai\xe2\x80\x9d in the language of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9coui\xe2\x80\x9d, or a \xe2\x80\x9cvirelai\xe2\x80\x9d, or a ballad in the vulgar English. 23\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ballad, a ballad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst all the \xe2\x80\x98ocs\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ouis\xe2\x80\x99 of France. Downright English am I, Sir Knight, and downright\r\nEnglish was my patron St Dunstan, and scorned \xe2\x80\x98oc\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98oui\xe2\x80\x99, as he\r\nwould have scorned the parings of the devil\xe2\x80\x99s hoof\xe2\x80\x94downright English\r\nalone shall be sung in this cell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will assay, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9ca ballad composed by a Saxon\r\nglee-man, whom I knew in Holy Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt speedily appeared, that if the knight was not a complete master of\r\nthe minstrel art, his taste for it had at least been cultivated under\r\nthe best instructors. Art had taught him to soften the faults of a\r\nvoice which had little compass, and was naturally rough rather than\r\nmellow, and, in short, had done all that culture can do in supplying\r\nnatural deficiencies. His performance, therefore, might have been\r\ntermed very respectable by abler judges than the hermit, especially as\r\nthe knight threw into the notes now a degree of spirit, and now of\r\nplaintive enthusiasm, which gave force and energy to the verses which\r\nhe sung.\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADER\xe2\x80\x99S RETURN.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nHigh deeds achieved of knightly fame,\r\nFrom Palestine the champion came;\r\nThe cross upon his shoulders borne,\r\nBattle and blast had dimm\xe2\x80\x99d and torn.\r\nEach dint upon his batter\xe2\x80\x99d shield\r\nWas token of a foughten field;\r\nAnd thus, beneath his lady\xe2\x80\x99s bower,\r\nHe sung as fell the twilight hour:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy to the fair!\xe2\x80\x94thy knight behold,\r\nReturn\xe2\x80\x99d from yonder land of gold;\r\nNo wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,\r\nSave his good arms and battle-steed\r\nHis spurs, to dash against a foe,\r\nHis lance and sword to lay him low;\r\nSuch all the trophies of his toil,\r\nSuch\xe2\x80\x94and the hope of Tekla\xe2\x80\x99s smile!\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy to the fair! whose constant knight\r\nHer favour fired to feats of might;\r\nUnnoted shall she not remain,\r\nWhere meet the bright and noble train;\r\nMinstrel shall sing and herald tell\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mark yonder maid of beauty well,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis she for whose bright eyes were won\r\nThe listed field at Askalon!\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Note well her smile!\xe2\x80\x94it edged the blade\r\nWhich fifty wives to widows made,\r\nWhen, vain his strength and Mahound\xe2\x80\x99s spell,\r\nIconium\xe2\x80\x99s turban\xe2\x80\x99d Soldan fell.\r\nSeest thou her locks, whose sunny glow\r\nHalf shows, half shades, her neck of snow?\r\nTwines not of them one golden thread,\r\nBut for its sake a Paynim bled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoy to the fair!\xe2\x80\x94my name unknown,\r\nEach deed, and all its praise thine own\r\nThen, oh! unbar this churlish gate,\r\nThe night dew falls, the hour is late.\r\nInured to Syria\xe2\x80\x99s glowing breath,\r\nI feel the north breeze chill as death;\r\nLet grateful love quell maiden shame,\r\nAnd grant him bliss who brings thee fame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this performance, the hermit demeaned himself much like a\r\nfirst-rate critic of the present day at a new opera. He reclined back\r\nupon his seat, with his eyes half shut; now, folding his hands and\r\ntwisting his thumbs, he seemed absorbed in attention, and anon,\r\nbalancing his expanded palms, he gently flourished them in time to the\r\nmusic. At one or two favourite cadences, he threw in a little\r\nassistance of his own, where the knight\xe2\x80\x99s voice seemed unable to carry\r\nthe air so high as his worshipful taste approved. When the song was\r\nended, the anchorite emphatically declared it a good one, and well\r\nsung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI think my Saxon countrymen had herded long enough\r\nwith the Normans, to fall into the tone of their melancholy ditties.\r\nWhat took the honest knight from home? or what could he expect but to\r\nfind his mistress agreeably engaged with a rival on his return, and his\r\nserenade, as they call it, as little regarded as the caterwauling of a\r\ncat in the gutter? Nevertheless, Sir Knight, I drink this cup to thee,\r\nto the success of all true lovers\xe2\x80\x94I fear you are none,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, on\r\nobserving that the knight (whose brain began to be heated with these\r\nrepeated draughts) qualified his flagon from the water pitcher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cdid you not tell me that this water was from\r\nthe well of your blessed patron, St Dunstan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cand many a hundred of pagans did he\r\nbaptize there, but I never heard that he drank any of it. Every thing\r\nshould be put to its proper use in this world. St Dunstan knew, as well\r\nas any one, the prerogatives of a jovial friar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, he reached the harp, and entertained his guest with the\r\nfollowing characteristic song, to a sort of derry-down chorus,\r\nappropriate to an old English ditty. 24\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE BAREFOOTED FRIAR.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give thee, good fellow, a twelvemonth or twain,\r\nTo search Europe through, from Byzantium to Spain;\r\nBut ne\xe2\x80\x99er shall you find, should you search till you tire,\r\nSo happy a man as the Barefooted Friar.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\nYour knight for his lady pricks forth in career,\r\nAnd is brought home at even-song prick\xe2\x80\x99d through with a spear;\r\nI confess him in haste\xe2\x80\x94for his lady desires\r\nNo comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\nYour monarch?\xe2\x80\x94Pshaw! many a prince has been known\r\nTo barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,\r\nBut which of us e\xe2\x80\x99er felt the idle desire\r\nTo exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThe Friar has walk\xe2\x80\x99d out, and where\xe2\x80\x99er he has gone,\r\nThe land and its fatness is mark\xe2\x80\x99d for his own;\r\nHe can roam where he lists, he can stop when he tires,\r\nFor every man\xe2\x80\x99s house is the Barefooted Friar\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s expected at noon, and no wight till he comes\r\nMay profane the great chair, or the porridge of plums\r\nFor the best of the cheer, and the seat by the fire,\r\nIs the undenied right of the Barefooted Friar.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s expected at night, and the pasty\xe2\x80\x99s made hot,\r\nThey broach the brown ale, and they fill the black pot,\r\nAnd the goodwife would wish the goodman in the mire,\r\nEre he lack\xe2\x80\x99d a soft pillow, the Barefooted Friar.\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nLong flourish the sandal, the cord, and the cope,\r\nThe dread of the devil and trust of the Pope;\r\nFor to gather life\xe2\x80\x99s roses, unscathed by the briar,\r\nIs granted alone to the Barefooted Friar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my troth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast sung well and lustily, and\r\nin high praise of thine order. And, talking of the devil, Holy Clerk,\r\nare you not afraid that he may pay you a visit during some of your\r\nuncanonical pastimes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI uncanonical!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hermit; \xe2\x80\x9cI scorn the charge\xe2\x80\x94I scorn it\r\nwith my heels!\xe2\x80\x94I serve the duty of my chapel duly and truly\xe2\x80\x94Two masses\r\ndaily, morning and evening, primes, noons, and vespers, \xe2\x80\x98aves, credos,\r\npaters\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcepting moonlight nights, when the venison is in season,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Exceptis excipiendis\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cas our old abbot taught\r\nme to say, when impertinent laymen should ask me if I kept every\r\npunctilio of mine order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, holy father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the devil is apt to keep an\r\neye on such exceptions; he goes about, thou knowest, like a roaring\r\nlion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him roar here if he dares,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar; \xe2\x80\x9ca touch of my cord\r\nwill make him roar as loud as the tongs of St Dunstan himself did. I\r\nnever feared man, and I as little fear the devil and his imps. Saint\r\nDunstan, Saint Dubric, Saint Winibald, Saint Winifred, Saint Swibert,\r\nSaint Willick, not forgetting Saint Thomas a Kent, and my own poor\r\nmerits to speed, I defy every devil of them, come cut and long\r\ntail.\xe2\x80\x94But to let you into a secret, I never speak upon such subjects,\r\nmy friend, until after morning vespers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe changed the conversation; fast and furious grew the mirth of the\r\nparties, and many a song was exchanged betwixt them, when their revels\r\nwere interrupted by a loud knocking at the door of the hermitage.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the\r\nadventures of another set of our characters; for, like old Ariosto, we\r\ndo not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with\r\nany one personage of our drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAway! our journey lies through dell and dingle,\r\nWhere the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother,\r\nWhere the broad oak, with intercepting boughs,\r\nChequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley\xe2\x80\x94\r\nUp and away!\xe2\x80\x94for lovely paths are these\r\nTo tread, when the glad Sun is on his throne\r\nLess pleasant, and less safe, when Cynthia\xe2\x80\x99s lamp\r\nWith doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest.\r\n\r\n\r\nETTRICK FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cedric the Saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at\r\nAshby, his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of\r\nhis own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. He could not\r\nbring himself to acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son\r\nwhom he had renounced and disinherited. He ordered, however, Oswald to\r\nkeep an eye upon him; and directed that officer, with two of his serfs,\r\nto convey Ivanhoe to Ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. Oswald,\r\nhowever, was anticipated in this good office. The crowd dispersed,\r\nindeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s cupbearer looked around for his young\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but\r\nhimself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him\r\nfrom the spot. Perhaps Oswald (for the Saxons were very superstitious)\r\nmight have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for Ivanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisappearance, had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired\r\nlike a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant\r\nGurth. Anxious concerning his master\xe2\x80\x99s fate, and in despair at his\r\nsudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him\r\neverywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the concealment on which\r\nhis own safety depended. Oswald deemed it his duty to secure Gurth, as\r\na fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge.\r\n\r\nRenewing his enquiries concerning the fate of Ivanhoe, the only\r\ninformation which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders was,\r\nthat the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired\r\ngrooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the\r\nspectators, which had immediately transported him out of the press.\r\nOswald, on receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to his\r\nmaster for farther instructions, carrying along with him Gurth, whom he\r\nconsidered in some sort as a deserter from the service of Cedric.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions\r\nconcerning his son; for Nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the\r\npatriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. But no sooner was he\r\ninformed that Ivanhoe was in careful, and probably in friendly hands,\r\nthan the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his\r\nfate, gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment, at\r\nwhat he termed Wilfred\xe2\x80\x99s filial disobedience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him wander his way,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clet those leech his wounds for whose\r\nsake he encountered them. He is fitter to do the juggling tricks of the\r\nNorman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his English\r\nancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf to maintain the honour of ancestry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, who was present,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in execution\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nboldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, I know no voice,\r\nsave his father\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe silent, Lady Rowena!\xe2\x80\x94on this subject only I hear you not. Prepare\r\nyourself for the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s festival: we have been summoned thither with\r\nunwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty\r\nNormans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of Hastings.\r\nThither will I go, were it only to show these proud Normans how little\r\nthe fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a Saxon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cdo I NOT go; and I pray you to beware, lest\r\nwhat you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted hardness of\r\nheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemain at home, then, ungrateful lady,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cthine is the\r\nhard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an\r\nidle and unauthorized attachment. I seek the noble Athelstane, and with\r\nhim attend the banquet of John of Anjou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned\r\nthe principal events. Immediately upon retiring from the castle, the\r\nSaxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the\r\nbustle which attended their doing so, that Cedric, for the first time,\r\ncast his eyes upon the deserter Gurth. The noble Saxon had returned\r\nfrom the banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted\r\nbut a pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gyves!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gyves!\xe2\x80\x94Oswald\xe2\x80\x94Hundibert!\xe2\x80\x94Dogs and\r\nvillains!\xe2\x80\x94why leave ye the knave unfettered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout daring to remonstrate, the companions of Gurth bound him with a\r\nhalter, as the readiest cord which occurred. He submitted to the\r\noperation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful look\r\nat his master, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis comes of loving your flesh and blood\r\nbetter than mine own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo horse, and forward!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed full time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the noble Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, if we ride\r\nnot the faster, the worthy Abbot Waltheoff\xe2\x80\x99s preparations for a\r\nrere-supper 25 will be altogether spoiled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of St\r\nWithold\xe2\x80\x99s before the apprehended evil took place. The Abbot, himself of\r\nancient Saxon descent, received the noble Saxons with the profuse and\r\nexuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late,\r\nor rather an early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host\r\nthe next morning until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection.\r\n\r\nAs the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened\r\nsomewhat alarming to the Saxons, who, of all people of Europe, were\r\nmost addicted to a superstitious observance of omens, and to whose\r\nopinions can be traced most of those notions upon such subjects, still\r\nto be found among our popular antiquities. For the Normans being a\r\nmixed race, and better informed according to the information of the\r\ntimes, had lost most of the superstitious prejudices which their\r\nancestors had brought from Scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon\r\nthinking freely on such topics.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was\r\ninspired by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog,\r\nwhich, sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders\r\nleft the gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to\r\nand fro, seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like not that music, father Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane; for by this\r\ntitle of respect he was accustomed to address him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I either, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cI greatly fear we shall have to pay\r\nthe piper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, upon whose memory the Abbot\xe2\x80\x99s good ale\r\n(for Burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a\r\nfavourable impression,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin my mind we had better turn back, and abide\r\nwith the Abbot until the afternoon. It is unlucky to travel where your\r\npath is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have\r\neaten your next meal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cthe day is already too short for our\r\njourney. For the dog, I know it to be the cur of the runaway slave\r\nGurth, a useless fugitive like its master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at\r\nthe interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor\r\nFangs\xe2\x80\x94for Fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his\r\nstolen expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way,\r\nrejoicing at his reappearance. The javelin inflicted a wound upon the\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and\r\nFangs fled howling from the presence of the enraged thane. Gurth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart swelled within him; for he felt this meditated slaughter of his\r\nfaithful adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he\r\nhad himself received. Having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his\r\neyes, he said to Wamba, who, seeing his master\xe2\x80\x99s ill humour had\r\nprudently retreated to the rear, \xe2\x80\x9cI pray thee, do me the kindness to\r\nwipe my eyes with the skirt of thy mantle; the dust offends me, and\r\nthese bonds will not let me help myself one way or another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for\r\nsome time, during which Gurth maintained a moody silence. At length he\r\ncould repress his feelings no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cof all those who are fools enough to serve\r\nCedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable\r\nto him. Go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor\r\nfear will Gurth serve him longer. He may strike the head from me\xe2\x80\x94he may\r\nscourge me\xe2\x80\x94he may load me with irons\xe2\x80\x94but henceforth he shall never\r\ncompel me either to love or to obey him. Go to him, then, and tell him\r\nthat Gurth the son of Beowulph renounces his service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cfool as I am, I shall not do your fool\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nerrand. Cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou\r\nknowest he does not always miss his mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9chow soon he makes a mark of me. Yesterday\r\nhe left Wilfred, my young master, in his blood. To-day he has striven\r\nto kill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed\r\nme kindness. By St Edmund, St Dunstan, St Withold, St Edward the\r\nConfessor, and every other Saxon saint in the calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d (for Cedric\r\nnever swore by any that was not of Saxon lineage, and all his household\r\nhad the same limited devotion,) \xe2\x80\x9cI will never forgive him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my thinking now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, who was frequently wont to act\r\nas peace-maker in the family, \xe2\x80\x9cour master did not propose to hurt\r\nFangs, but only to affright him. For, if you observed, he rose in his\r\nstirrups, as thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so he would have\r\ndone, but Fangs happening to bound up at the very moment, received a\r\nscratch, which I will be bound to heal with a penny\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of tar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif I could but think so\xe2\x80\x94but no\xe2\x80\x94I saw the\r\njavelin was well aimed\xe2\x80\x94I heard it whizz through the air with all the\r\nwrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it had\r\npitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark. By\r\nthe hog dear to St Anthony, I renounce him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no\r\nefforts of the Jester could again induce him to break.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cedric and Athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed\r\ntogether on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal\r\nfamily, on the feuds and quarrels among the Norman nobles, and on the\r\nchance which there was that the oppressed Saxons might be able to free\r\nthemselves from the yoke of the Normans, or at least to elevate\r\nthemselves into national consequence and independence, during the civil\r\nconvulsions which were likely to ensue. On this subject Cedric was all\r\nanimation. The restoration of the independence of his race was the idol\r\nof his heart, to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic happiness\r\nand the interests of his own son. But, in order to achieve this great\r\nrevolution in favour of the native English, it was necessary that they\r\nshould be united among themselves, and act under an acknowledged head.\r\nThe necessity of choosing their chief from the Saxon blood-royal was\r\nnot only evident in itself, but had been made a solemn condition by\r\nthose whom Cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes.\r\nAthelstane had this quality at least; and though he had few mental\r\naccomplishments or talents to recommend him as a leader, he had still a\r\ngoodly person, was no coward, had been accustomed to martial exercises,\r\nand seemed willing to defer to the advice of counsellors more wise than\r\nhimself. Above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and\r\nbelieved to be good-natured. But whatever pretensions Athelstane had to\r\nbe considered as head of the Saxon confederacy, many of that nation\r\nwere disposed to prefer to the title of the Lady Rowena, who drew her\r\ndescent from Alfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for\r\nwisdom, courage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his\r\noppressed countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt would have been no difficult thing for Cedric, had he been so\r\ndisposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as\r\nformidable at least as any of the others. To counterbalance their royal\r\ndescent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted\r\nattachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of The\r\nSaxon, and his birth was inferior to none, excepting only that of\r\nAthelstane and his ward. These qualities, however, were unalloyed by\r\nthe slightest shade of selfishness; and, instead of dividing yet\r\nfarther his weakened nation by forming a faction of his own, it was a\r\nleading part of Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s plan to extinguish that which already existed,\r\nby promoting a marriage betwixt Rowena and Athelstane. An obstacle\r\noccurred to this his favourite project, in the mutual attachment of his\r\nward and his son and hence the original cause of the banishment of\r\nWilfred from the house of his father.\r\n\r\nThis stern measure Cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during Wilfred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence, Rowena might relinquish her preference, but in this hope he\r\nwas disappointed; a disappointment which might be attributed in part to\r\nthe mode in which his ward had been educated. Cedric, to whom the name\r\nof Alfred was as that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion\r\nof that great monarch with a degree of observance, such as, perhaps,\r\nwas in those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess. Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill had been in almost all cases a law to his household; and Cedric\r\nhimself, as if determined that her sovereignty should be fully\r\nacknowledged within that little circle at least, seemed to take a pride\r\nin acting as the first of her subjects. Thus trained in the exercise\r\nnot only of free will, but despotic authority, Rowena was, by her\r\nprevious education, disposed both to resist and to resent any attempt\r\nto control her affections, or dispose of her hand contrary to her\r\ninclinations, and to assert her independence in a case in which even\r\nthose females who have been trained up to obedience and subjection, are\r\nnot infrequently apt to dispute the authority of guardians and parents.\r\nThe opinions which she felt strongly, she avowed boldly; and Cedric,\r\nwho could not free himself from his habitual deference to her opinions,\r\nfelt totally at a loss how to enforce his authority of guardian.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a\r\nvisionary throne. Rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither\r\nconsidered his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was\r\nconcerned, could it have been achieved. Without attempting to conceal\r\nher avowed preference of Wilfred of Ivanhoe, she declared that, were\r\nthat favoured knight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a\r\nconvent, than share a throne with Athelstane, whom, having always\r\ndespised, she now began, on account of the trouble she received on his\r\naccount, thoroughly to detest.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Cedric, whose opinions of women\xe2\x80\x99s constancy was far from\r\nstrong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the\r\nproposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important\r\nservice to the Saxon cause. The sudden and romantic appearance of his\r\nson in the lists at Ashby, he had justly regarded as almost a death\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblow to his hopes. His paternal affection, it is true, had for an\r\ninstant gained the victory over pride and patriotism; but both had\r\nreturned in full force, and under their joint operation, he was now\r\nbent upon making a determined effort for the union of Athelstane and\r\nRowena, together with expediting those other measures which seemed\r\nnecessary to forward the restoration of Saxon independence.\r\n\r\nOn this last subject, he was now labouring with Athelstane, not without\r\nhaving reason, every now and then, to lament, like Hotspur, that he\r\nshould have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an\r\naction. Athelstane, it is true, was vain enough, and loved to have his\r\nears tickled with tales of his high descent, and of his right by\r\ninheritance to homage and sovereignty. But his petty vanity was\r\nsufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands of his\r\nimmediate attendants, and of the Saxons who approached him. If he had\r\nthe courage to encounter danger, he at least hated the trouble of going\r\nto seek it; and while he agreed in the general principles laid down by\r\nCedric concerning the claim of the Saxons to independence, and was\r\nstill more easily convinced of his own title to reign over them when\r\nthat independence should be attained, yet when the means of asserting\r\nthese rights came to be discussed, he was still \xe2\x80\x9cAthelstane the\r\nUnready,\xe2\x80\x9d slow, irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising. The\r\nwarm and impassioned exhortations of Cedric had as little effect upon\r\nhis impassive temper, as red-hot balls alighting in the water, which\r\nproduce a little sound and smoke, and are instantly extinguished.\r\n\r\nIf, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired\r\njade, or to hammering upon cold iron, Cedric fell back to his ward\r\nRowena, he received little more satisfaction from conferring with her.\r\nFor, as his presence interrupted the discourse between the lady and her\r\nfavourite attendant upon the gallantry and fate of Wilfred, Elgitha\r\nfailed not to revenge both her mistress and herself, by recurring to\r\nthe overthrow of Athelstane in the lists, the most disagreeable subject\r\nwhich could greet the ears of Cedric. To this sturdy Saxon, therefore,\r\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s journey was fraught with all manner of displeasure and\r\ndiscomfort; so that he more than once internally cursed the tournament,\r\nand him who had proclaimed it, together with his own folly in ever\r\nthinking of going thither.\r\n\r\nAt noon, upon the motion of Athelstane, the travellers paused in a\r\nwoodland shade by a fountain, to repose their horses and partake of\r\nsome provisions, with which the hospitable Abbot had loaded a sumpter\r\nmule. Their repast was a pretty long one; and these several\r\ninterruptions rendered it impossible for them to hope to reach\r\nRotherwood without travelling all night, a conviction which induced\r\nthem to proceed on their way at a more hasty pace than they had\r\nhitherto used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nA train of armed men, some noble dame\r\nEscorting, (so their scatter\xe2\x80\x99d words discover\xe2\x80\x99d,\r\nAs unperceived I hung upon their rear,)\r\nAre close at hand, and mean to pass the night\r\nWithin the castle.\r\n\r\n\r\nORRA, A TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and\r\nwere about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time\r\nfrom the number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to\r\ndespair, and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could\r\neasily bid defiance to the feeble police of the period. From these\r\nrovers, however, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour Cedric and\r\nAthelstane accounted themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten\r\nservants, besides Wamba and Gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon,\r\nthe one being a jester and the other a captive. It may be added, that\r\nin travelling thus late through the forest, Cedric and Athelstane\r\nrelied on their descent and character, as well as their courage. The\r\noutlaws, whom the severity of the forest laws had reduced to this\r\nroving and desperate mode of life, were chiefly peasants and yeomen of\r\nSaxon descent, and were generally supposed to respect the persons and\r\nproperty of their countrymen.\r\n\r\nAs the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated\r\ncries for assistance; and when they rode up to the place from whence\r\nthey came, they were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the\r\nground, beside which sat a young woman, richly dressed in the Jewish\r\nfashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to\r\nthe same nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the\r\ndeepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nTo the enquiries of Athelstane and Cedric, the old Jew could for some\r\ntime only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of\r\nthe Old Testament successively against the sons of Ishmael, who were\r\ncoming to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. When\r\nhe began to come to himself out of this agony of terror, Isaac of York\r\n(for it was our old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had\r\nhired a body-guard of six men at Ashby, together with mules for\r\ncarrying the litter of a sick friend. This party had undertaken to\r\nescort him as far as Doncaster. They had come thus far in safety; but\r\nhaving received information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong\r\nband of outlaws lying in wait in the woods before them, Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmercenaries had not only taken flight, but had carried off with them\r\nthe horses which bore the litter and left the Jew and his daughter\r\nwithout the means either of defence or of retreat, to be plundered, and\r\nprobably murdered, by the banditti, who they expected every moment\r\nwould bring down upon them. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it but please your valours,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nIsaac, in a tone of deep humiliation, \xe2\x80\x9cto permit the poor Jews to\r\ntravel under your safeguard, I swear by the tables of our law, that\r\nnever has favour been conferred upon a child of Israel since the days\r\nof our captivity, which shall be more gratefully acknowledged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDog of a Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, whose memory was of that petty kind\r\nwhich stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling\r\noffences, \xe2\x80\x9cdost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at\r\nthe tilt-yard? Fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost\r\nlist, ask neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such as\r\nthee, who rob all the world, I, for mine own share, shall hold them\r\nright honest folk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nshall do better,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto leave them two of our attendants and two\r\nhorses to convey them back to the next village. It will diminish our\r\nstrength but little; and with your good sword, noble Athelstane, and\r\nthe aid of those who remain, it will be light work for us to face\r\ntwenty of those runagates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so\r\nnear them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. But Rebecca\r\nsuddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the\r\nattendants to the palfrey of the Saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the\r\nOriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarment. Then rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her in\r\nthe great name of the God whom they both worshipped, and by that\r\nrevelation of the Law upon Mount Sinai, in which they both believed,\r\nthat she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward\r\nunder their safeguard. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for myself that I pray this favour,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cnor is it even for that poor old man. I know that to\r\nwrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit, with\r\nthe Christians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in\r\nthe desert, or in the field? But it is in the name of one dear to many,\r\nand dear even to you, that I beseech you to let this sick person be\r\ntransported with care and tenderness under your protection. For, if\r\nevil chance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with\r\nregret for denying that which I ask of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe noble and solemn air with which Rebecca made this appeal, gave it\r\ndouble weight with the fair Saxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man is old and feeble,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her guardian, \xe2\x80\x9cthe maiden\r\nyoung and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life\xe2\x80\x94Jews\r\nthough they be, we cannot as Christians leave them in this extremity.\r\nLet them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind\r\ntwo of the serfs. The mules may transport the litter, and we have led\r\nhorses for the old man and his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric readily assented to what she proposed, and Athelstane only added\r\nthe condition, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they should travel in the rear of the whole party,\r\nwhere Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmight attend them with his shield of boar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have left my shield in the tilt-yard,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cas has\r\nbeen the fate of many a better knight than myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAthelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the last\r\nday of the tournament; while Rowena, who was pleased in the same\r\nproportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling\r\nsuitor, requested Rebecca to ride by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were not fit I should do so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, with proud\r\nhumility, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere my society might be held a disgrace to my\r\nprotectress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9coutlaws\xe2\x80\x9d rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach\r\nof twilight made the sound yet more impressive. Amid the bustle, Gurth\r\nwas taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed\r\nupon the Jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. It\r\nwas so negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of\r\nWamba, that Gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether\r\nfrom bondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape\r\nfrom the party.\r\n\r\nThe bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before Gurth was\r\nmissed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind\r\na servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him\r\nunder his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them that\r\nGurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate\r\nexpectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held\r\nconvenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to\r\nadmit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and\r\nbegan to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were\r\nbroken, swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. Cedric and\r\nAthelstane, who were at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of\r\nbeing attacked at this pass; but neither of them having had much\r\npractice in war, no better mode of preventing the danger occurred to\r\nthem than that they should hasten through the defile as fast as\r\npossible. Advancing, therefore, without much order, they had just\r\ncrossed the brook with a part of their followers, when they were\r\nassailed in front, flank, and rear at once, with an impetuosity to\r\nwhich, in their confused and ill-prepared condition, it was impossible\r\nto offer effectual resistance. The shout of \xe2\x80\x9cA white dragon!\xe2\x80\x94a white\r\ndragon!\xe2\x80\x94Saint George for merry England!\xe2\x80\x9d war-cries adopted by the\r\nassailants, as belonging to their assumed character of Saxon outlaws,\r\nwas heard on every side, and on every side enemies appeared with a\r\nrapidity of advance and attack which seemed to multiply their numbers.\r\n\r\nBoth the Saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each\r\nunder circumstances expressive of his character. Cedric, the instant\r\nthat an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which,\r\ntaking better effect than that which he had hurled at Fangs, nailed the\r\nman against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. Thus far\r\nsuccessful, Cedric spurred his horse against a second, drawing his\r\nsword at the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that\r\nhis weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him, and he was\r\ndisarmed by the violence of his own blow. He was instantly made\r\nprisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who\r\ncrowded around him. Athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having\r\nbeen seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could\r\ndraw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.\r\n\r\nThe attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at\r\nthe fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while\r\nthe Lady Rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the Jew and his\r\ndaughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.\r\n\r\nOf all the train none escaped except Wamba, who showed upon the\r\noccasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense.\r\nHe possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who\r\nwas just drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him\r\nlike a lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave\r\nthough ineffectual attempt to succour his master. Finding himself\r\noverpowered, the Jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged\r\ninto the thicket, and, favoured by the general confusion, escaped from\r\nthe scene of action. Yet the valiant Jester, as soon as he found\r\nhimself safe, hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back\r\nand share the captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it\r\nnow that I have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in\r\na low and cautious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cWamba!\xe2\x80\x9d and, at the same time, a dog, which\r\nhe recognised to be Fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cGurth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately\r\nstood before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said he eagerly; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat mean these cries, and that\r\nclashing of swords?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a trick of the times,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are all prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are prisoners?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gurth, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lord, and my lady, and Athelstane, and Hundibert, and Oswald.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9chow came they prisoners?\xe2\x80\x94and to\r\nwhom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur master was too ready to fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9cand Athelstane\r\nwas not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. And they\r\nare prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. And they lie all\r\ntumbled about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to\r\nyour swine. And I would laugh at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the honest Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\r\ncould for weeping.\xe2\x80\x9d And he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.\r\n\r\nGurth\xe2\x80\x99s countenance kindled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWamba,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast a weapon, and\r\nthy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,\xe2\x80\x94we are only two\xe2\x80\x94but a\r\nsudden attack from men of resolution will do much\xe2\x80\x94follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x94and for what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo rescue Cedric.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have renounced his service but now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cwas but while he was fortunate\xe2\x80\x94follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the Jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his\r\nappearance, and commanded them both to halt. From his dress and arms,\r\nWamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had\r\njust assailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the\r\nglittering baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which\r\nit supported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his\r\nvoice and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise\r\nLocksley the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such\r\ndisadvantageous circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of all this,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cor who is it that rifle,\r\nand ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may look at their cassocks close by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cand see whether\r\nthey be thy children\xe2\x80\x99s coats or no\xe2\x80\x94for they are as like thine own, as\r\none green pea-cod is to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will learn that presently,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cand I charge ye, on\r\nperil of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until I\r\nhave returned. Obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your\r\nmasters.\xe2\x80\x94Yet stay, I must render myself as like these men as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from\r\nhis cap, and gave them to Wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch,\r\nand, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his\r\npurposes of reconnoitring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we stand fast, Gurth?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cor shall we e\xe2\x80\x99en give him\r\nleg-bail? In my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too\r\nmuch in readiness, to be himself a true man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him be the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9can he will. We can be no worse of\r\nwaiting his return. If he belong to that party, he must already have\r\ngiven them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly.\r\nBesides, I have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst\r\nmen in the world to have to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Gurth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have mingled among yon men, and have learnt\r\nto whom they belong, and whither they are bound. There is, I think, no\r\nchance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their\r\nprisoners. For three men to attempt them at this moment, were little\r\nelse than madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such,\r\nplaced sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches. But I trust\r\nsoon to gather such a force, as may act in defiance of all their\r\nprecautions; you are both servants, and, as I think, faithful servants,\r\nof Cedric the Saxon, the friend of the rights of Englishmen. He shall\r\nnot want English hands to help him in this extremity. Come then with\r\nme, until I gather more aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the\r\njester and the swineherd. It was not consistent with Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s humour to\r\ntravel long in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still\r\ncarried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that\r\nnot so long since as Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9ccould take it on my halidome, that I have heard\r\nthe voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day,\r\nand that the moon is not three days older since I did so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine honest friends,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cwho, or what I am, is\r\nlittle to the present purpose; should I free your master, you will have\r\nreason to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. And\r\nwhether I am known by one name or another\xe2\x80\x94or whether I can draw a bow\r\nas well or better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to\r\nwalk in sunshine or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not\r\nconcern you, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur heads are in the lion\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, in a whisper to Gurth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cget them out how we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush\xe2\x80\x94be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth. \xe2\x80\x9cOffend him not by thy folly, and I trust\r\nsincerely that all will go well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen autumn nights were long and drear,\r\n    And forest walks were dark and dim,\r\nHow sweetly on the pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s ear\r\n    Was wont to steal the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s hymn\r\n\r\nDevotion borrows Music\xe2\x80\x99s tone,\r\n    And Music took Devotion\xe2\x80\x99s wing;\r\nAnd, like the bird that hails the sun,\r\n    They soar to heaven, and soaring sing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERMIT OF ST CLEMENT\xe2\x80\x99S WELL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was after three hours\xe2\x80\x99 good walking that the servants of Cedric,\r\nwith their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest,\r\nin the centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing\r\nits twisted branches in every direction. Beneath this tree four or five\r\nyeomen lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked\r\nto and fro in the moonlight shade.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave\r\nthe alarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows.\r\nSix arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from\r\nwhich the travellers approached, when their guide, being recognised,\r\nwas welcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs\r\nand fears of a rough reception at once subsided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the Miller?\xe2\x80\x9d was his first question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the road towards Rotherham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith how many?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith six men, and good hope of booty, if it please St Nicholas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevoutly spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cand where is Allan-a-Dale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalked up towards the Watling-street, to watch for the Prior of\r\nJorvaulx.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is well thought on also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand where is the\r\nFriar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his cell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThither will I go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley. \xe2\x80\x9cDisperse and seek your companions.\r\nCollect what force you can, for there\xe2\x80\x99s game afoot that must be hunted\r\nhard, and will turn to bay. Meet me here by daybreak.\xe2\x80\x94And stay,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten what is most necessary of the whole\xe2\x80\x94Two of you\r\ntake the road quickly towards Torquilstone, the Castle of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf. A set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such\r\nguise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither\xe2\x80\x94Watch them\r\nclosely, for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force,\r\nour honour is concerned to punish them, and we will find means to do\r\nso. Keep a close watch on them therefore; and dispatch one of your\r\ncomrades, the lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen\r\nthereabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on their\r\ndifferent errands. In the meanwhile, their leader and his two\r\ncompanions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some\r\nfear, pursued their way to the Chapel of Copmanhurst.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the\r\nreverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well suited\r\nto ascetic devotion, Wamba whispered to Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cIf this be the\r\nhabitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, The nearer the\r\nchurch the farther from God.\xe2\x80\x94And by my coxcomb,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\r\nbe even so\xe2\x80\x94Hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in\r\nthe hermitage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent\r\nof their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was\r\nthe burden:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, trowl the brown bowl to me,\r\n    Bully boy, bully boy,\r\nCome, trowl the brown bowl to me:\r\n    Ho! jolly Jenkin, I spy a knave in drinking,\r\nCome, trowl the brown bowl to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that is not ill sung,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, who had thrown in a few of his\r\nown flourishes to help out the chorus. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who, in the saint\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\never expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncell at midnight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, that should I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the jolly Clerk of Copmanhurst\r\nis a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk.\r\nMen say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he\r\nwill be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not\r\nbetter order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus speaking, Locksley\xe2\x80\x99s loud and repeated knocks had\r\nat length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. \xe2\x80\x9cBy my beads,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, \xe2\x80\x9chere come more\r\nbenighted guests. I would not for my cowl that they found us in this\r\ngoodly exercise. All men have their enemies, good Sir Sluggard; and\r\nthere be those malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment\r\nwhich I have been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of\r\nthree short hours, into sheer drunkenness and debauchery, vices alike\r\nalien to my profession and my disposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBase calumniators!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cI would I had the chastising\r\nof them. Nevertheless, Holy Clerk, it is true that all have their\r\nenemies; and there be those in this very land whom I would rather speak\r\nto through the bars of my helmet than barefaced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet thine iron pot on thy head then, friend Sluggard, as quickly as\r\nthy nature will permit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I remove these pewter\r\nflagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate; and to\r\ndrown the clatter\xe2\x80\x94for, in faith, I feel somewhat unsteady\xe2\x80\x94strike into\r\nthe tune which thou hearest me sing; it is no matter for the words\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nscarce know them myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he struck up a thundering \xe2\x80\x9cDe profundis clamavi\xe2\x80\x9d, under\r\ncover of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet: while the\r\nknight, laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted\r\nhis host with his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat devil\xe2\x80\x99s matins are you after at this hour?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven forgive you, Sir Traveller!\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit, whose own noise,\r\nand perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents\r\nwhich were tolerably familiar to him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWend on your way, in the name of\r\nGod and Saint Dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad priest,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the voice from without, \xe2\x80\x9copen to Locksley!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s safe\xe2\x80\x94all\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit to his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cit imports me much to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hermit; \xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee he is a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what friend?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cfor he may be friend to thee\r\nand none of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat friend?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hermit; \xe2\x80\x9cthat, now, is one of the questions\r\nthat is more easily asked than answered. What friend?\xe2\x80\x94why, he is, now\r\nthat I bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper I told thee of\r\na while since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nknight, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it not. But undo the door to him before he beat it\r\nfrom its hinges.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the\r\ncommencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice of\r\nhim who stood without; for, totally changing their manner, they\r\nscratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission.\r\nThe hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted Locksley, with\r\nhis two companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, hermit,\xe2\x80\x9d was the yeoman\xe2\x80\x99s first question as soon as he beheld the\r\nknight, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat boon companion hast thou here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA brother of our order,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friar, shaking his head; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have\r\nbeen at our orisons all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a monk of the church militant, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthere be more of them abroad. I tell thee, friar, thou must lay down\r\nthe rosary and take up the quarter-staff; we shall need every one of\r\nour merry men, whether clerk or layman.\xe2\x80\x94But,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking him a\r\nstep aside, \xe2\x80\x9cart thou mad? to give admittance to a knight thou dost not\r\nknow? Hast thou forgot our articles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot know him!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friar, boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know him as well as the\r\nbeggar knows his dish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is his name, then?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Locksley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chis name is Sir Anthony of Scrabelstone\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nif I would drink with a man, and did not know his name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast been drinking more than enough, friar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woodsman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand, I fear, prating more than enough too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood yeoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, coming forward, \xe2\x80\x9cbe not wroth with my\r\nmerry host. He did but afford me the hospitality which I would have\r\ncompelled from him if he had refused it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou compel!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friar; \xe2\x80\x9cwait but till have changed this grey\r\ngown for a green cassock, and if I make not a quarter-staff ring twelve\r\nupon thy pate, I am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close\r\nblack buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a\r\ncassock of green, and hose of the same colour. \xe2\x80\x9cI pray thee truss my\r\npoints,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cand thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy\r\nlabour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy for thy sack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cbut think\xe2\x80\x99st thou it is lawful\r\nfor me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful\r\nforester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hermit; \xe2\x80\x9cI will but confess the sins of my green\r\ncloak to my greyfriar\xe2\x80\x99s frock, and all shall be well again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester; \xe2\x80\x9ca broadcloth penitent should have a\r\nsackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into\r\nthe bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the\r\nendless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the\r\ndoublet were then termed.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus employed, Locksley led the knight a little apart,\r\nand addressed him thus:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDeny it not, Sir Knight\xe2\x80\x94you are he who decided\r\nthe victory to the advantage of the English against the strangers on\r\nthe second day of the tournament at Ashby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should in that case hold you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9ca friend to the\r\nweaker party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is the duty of a true knight at least,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Black\r\nChampion; \xe2\x80\x9cand I would not willingly that there were reason to think\r\notherwise of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for my purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shouldst be as well a good\r\nEnglishman as a good knight; for that, which I have to speak of,\r\nconcerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially\r\nthat of a true-born native of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can speak to no one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cto whom England, and\r\nthe life of every Englishman, can be dearer than to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would willingly believe so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woodsman, \xe2\x80\x9cfor never had this\r\ncountry such need to be supported by those who love her. Hear me, and I\r\nwill tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be\xe2\x80\x99st really that\r\nwhich thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. A band of\r\nvillains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made\r\nthemselves master of the person of a noble Englishman, called Cedric\r\nthe Saxon, together with his ward, and his friend Athelstane of\r\nConingsburgh, and have transported them to a castle in this forest,\r\ncalled Torquilstone. I ask of thee, as a good knight and a good\r\nEnglishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am bound by my vow to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would\r\nwillingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the forester, \xe2\x80\x9ca nameless man; but I am the friend of my\r\ncountry, and of my country\xe2\x80\x99s friends\xe2\x80\x94With this account of me you must\r\nfor the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you\r\nyourself desire to continue unknown. Believe, however, that my word,\r\nwhen pledged, is as inviolate as if I wore golden spurs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI willingly believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been accustomed to\r\nstudy men\xe2\x80\x99s countenances, and I can read in thine honesty and\r\nresolution. I will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid\r\nthee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, I\r\ntrust we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba to Gurth,\xe2\x80\x94for the friar being now fully equipped, the\r\nJester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the\r\nconclusion of the conversation,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSo we have got a new ally?\xe2\x80\x94I trust the\r\nvalour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the\r\nhermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this Locksley looks like a\r\nborn deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold thy peace, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cit may all be as thou dost guess;\r\nbut were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to set\r\nat liberty Cedric and the Lady Rowena, I fear I should hardly have\r\nreligion enough to refuse the foul fiend\xe2\x80\x99s offer, and bid him get\r\nbehind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and\r\nbuckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. He\r\nleft his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked\r\nthe door, deposited the key under the threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou in condition to do good service, friar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cor\r\ndoes the brown bowl still run in thy head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more than a drought of St Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s fountain will allay,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe priest; \xe2\x80\x9csomething there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of\r\ninstability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of the\r\nfountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white\r\nmoonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, Holy Clerk of\r\nCopmanhurst?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal\r\nvent,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the friar, \xe2\x80\x9cand so left me nothing to drink but my\r\npatron\xe2\x80\x99s bounty here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them\r\nall marks of the midnight revel.\r\n\r\nThus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan\r\nround his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed,\r\nexclaiming at the same time, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere be those false ravishers, who carry\r\noff wenches against their will? May the foul fiend fly off with me, if\r\nI am not man enough for a dozen of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwearest thou, Holy Clerk?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClerk me no Clerks,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the transformed priest; \xe2\x80\x9cby Saint George\r\nand the Dragon, I am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94When I am cased in my green cassock, I will drink, swear, and woo\r\na lass, with any blithe forester in the West Riding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Jack Priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cand be silent; thou art as\r\nnoisy as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the Father Abbot has gone\r\nto bed.\xe2\x80\x94Come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it\xe2\x80\x94I say,\r\ncome on, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have,\r\nif we are to storm the Castle of Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is it Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has stopt on\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s highway the king\xe2\x80\x99s liege subjects?\xe2\x80\x94Is he turned thief and\r\noppressor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOppressor he ever was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for thief,\xe2\x80\x9d said the priest, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if ever he were even half so\r\nhonest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMove on, priest, and be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman; \xe2\x80\x9cit were better you\r\nled the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left\r\nunsaid, both in decency and prudence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas, how many hours and years have past,\r\nSince human forms have round this table sate,\r\nOr lamp, or taper, on its surface gleam\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\nMethinks, I hear the sound of time long pass\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nStill murmuring o\xe2\x80\x99er us, in the lofty void\r\nOf these dark arches, like the ling\xe2\x80\x99ring voices\r\nOf those who long within their graves have slept.\r\n\r\n\r\nORRA, A TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these measures were taking in behalf of Cedric and his\r\ncompanions, the armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried\r\ntheir captives along towards the place of security, where they intended\r\nto imprison them. But darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood\r\nseemed but imperfectly known to the marauders. They were compelled to\r\nmake several long halts, and once or twice to return on their road to\r\nresume the direction which they wished to pursue. The summer morn had\r\ndawned upon them ere they could travel in full assurance that they held\r\nthe right path. But confidence returned with light, and the cavalcade\r\nnow moved rapidly forward. Meanwhile, the following dialogue took place\r\nbetween the two leaders of the banditti.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time thou shouldst leave us, Sir Maurice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar to\r\nDe Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cin order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. Thou art\r\nnext, thou knowest, to act the Knight Deliverer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought better of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI will not leave thee\r\ntill the prize is fairly deposited in Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s castle. There\r\nwill I appear before the Lady Rowena in mine own shape, and trust that\r\nshe will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which\r\nI have been guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has made thee change thy plan, De Bracy?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Knight\r\nTemplar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat concerns thee nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would hope, however, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this\r\nalteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable\r\nmeaning, such as Fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy thoughts are my own,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fiend laughs, they\r\nsay, when one thief robs another; and we know, that were he to spit\r\nfire and brimstone instead, it would never prevent a Templar from\r\nfollowing his bent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the leader of a Free Company,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom dreading\r\nat the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he does to all\r\nmankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is unprofitable and perilous recrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuffice it to say, I know the morals of the Temple-Order, and I will\r\nnot give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which I\r\nhave run such risks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPsha,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat hast thou to fear?\xe2\x80\x94Thou knowest the\r\nvows of our order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight well,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cand also how they are kept. Come, Sir\r\nTemplar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in\r\nPalestine, and this is a case in which I will trust nothing to your\r\nconscience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the truth, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cI care not for your\r\nblue-eyed beauty. There is in that train one who will make me a better\r\nmate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel?\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, haughtily. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the waiting-woman\r\nwill I not stoop. I have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the mass, thou meanest the fair Jewess!\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwho shall gainsay me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one that I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cunless it be your vow of\r\ncelibacy, or a check of conscience for an intrigue with a Jewess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my vow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cour Grand Master hath granted me a\r\ndispensation. And for my conscience, a man that has slain three hundred\r\nSaracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl\r\nat her first confession upon Good Friday eve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest best thine own privileges,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy. \xe2\x80\x9cYet, I would\r\nhave sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurer\xe2\x80\x99s money bags,\r\nthan on the black eyes of the daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can admire both,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, the old Jew is but\r\nhalf-prize. I must share his spoils with Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, who will not\r\nlend us the use of his castle for nothing. I must have something that I\r\ncan term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and I have fixed on\r\nthe lovely Jewess as my peculiar prize. But, now thou knowest my drift,\r\nthou wilt resume thine own original plan, wilt thou not?\xe2\x80\x94Thou hast\r\nnothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cI will remain beside my prize. What thou sayst\r\nis passing true, but I like not the privileges acquired by the\r\ndispensation of the Grand Master, and the merit acquired by the\r\nslaughter of three hundred Saracens. You have too good a right to a\r\nfree pardon, to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this dialogue was proceeding, Cedric was endeavouring to wring\r\nout of those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should be Englishmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet, sacred Heaven! you prey\r\nupon your countrymen as if you were very Normans. You should be my\r\nneighbours, and, if so, my friends; for which of my English neighbours\r\nhave reason to be otherwise? I tell ye, yeomen, that even those among\r\nye who have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection; for\r\nI have pitied their miseries, and curst the oppression of their\r\ntyrannic nobles. What, then, would you have of me? or in what can this\r\nviolence serve ye?\xe2\x80\x94Ye are worse than brute beasts in your actions, and\r\nwill you imitate them in their very dumbness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too\r\nmany good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either by\r\nhis wrath or his expostulations. They continued to hurry him along,\r\ntravelling at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge\r\ntrees, arose Torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf. It was a fortress of no great size, consisting of a\r\ndonjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded by buildings of\r\ninferior height, which were encircled by an inner court-yard. Around\r\nthe exterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a\r\nneighbouring rivulet. Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, whose character placed him often\r\nat feud with his enemies, had made considerable additions to the\r\nstrength of his castle, by building towers upon the outward wall, so as\r\nto flank it at every angle. The access, as usual in castles of the\r\nperiod, lay through an arched barbican, or outwork, which was\r\nterminated and defended by a small turret at each corner.\r\n\r\nCedric no sooner saw the turrets of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s castle raise their\r\ngrey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above\r\nthe wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more\r\ntruly concerning the cause of his misfortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto the thieves and outlaws of these woods,\r\nwhen I supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; I might as\r\njustly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening\r\nwolves of France. Tell me, dogs\xe2\x80\x94is it my life or my wealth that your\r\nmaster aims at? Is it too much that two Saxons, myself and the noble\r\nAthelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the\r\npatrimony of our race?\xe2\x80\x94Put us then to death, and complete your tyranny\r\nby taking our lives, as you began with our liberties. If the Saxon\r\nCedric cannot rescue England, he is willing to die for her. Tell your\r\ntyrannical master, I do only beseech him to dismiss the Lady Rowena in\r\nhonour and safety. She is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with\r\nus will die all who dare fight in her cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and\r\nthey now stood before the gate of the castle. De Bracy winded his horn\r\nthree times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall\r\nupon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit\r\nthem. The prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were\r\nconducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of\r\nwhich none but Athelstane felt any inclination to partake. Neither had\r\nthe descendant of the Confessor much time to do justice to the good\r\ncheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and Cedric to\r\nunderstand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from\r\nRowena. Resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a\r\nlarge room, which, rising on clumsy Saxon pillars, resembled those\r\nrefectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most\r\nancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with\r\ncourtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to a\r\ndistant apartment. The same alarming distinction was conferred on\r\nRebecca, in spite of her father\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties, who offered even money,\r\nin this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide\r\nwith him. \xe2\x80\x9cBase unbeliever,\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of his guards, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen thou\r\nhast seen thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd, without farther discussion, the old Jew was forcibly dragged off\r\nin a different direction from the other prisoners. The domestics, after\r\nbeing carefully searched and disarmed, were confined in another part of\r\nthe castle; and Rowena was refused even the comfort she might have\r\nderived from the attendance of her handmaiden Elgitha.\r\n\r\nThe apartment in which the Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them we\r\nturn our first attention, although at present used as a sort of\r\nguard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now\r\nabandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, among other\r\nadditions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial\r\nresidence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was\r\nsupported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up with that\r\nhigher degree of ornament, which the Normans had already introduced\r\ninto architecture.\r\n\r\nCedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the\r\npast and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served,\r\ninstead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing\r\nsave the inconvenience of the present moment; and so little did he feel\r\neven this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by\r\nCedric\xe2\x80\x99s animated and impassioned appeal to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing\r\nhimself to Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cit was in this very hall that my father feasted\r\nwith Torquil Wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and\r\nunfortunate Harold, then advancing against the Norwegians, who had\r\nunited themselves to the rebel Tosti. It was in this hall that Harold\r\nreturned the magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother.\r\nOft have I heard my father kindle as he told the tale. The envoy of\r\nTosti was admitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd\r\nof noble Saxon leaders, who were quaffing the blood-red wine around\r\ntheir monarch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscourse, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at\r\nnoon\xe2\x80\x94we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and I\r\nnever have the benefit of my food when I eat immediately after\r\ndismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that\r\npractice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional\r\nobservation of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe envoy of Tosti,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmoved up the hall, undismayed by the\r\nfrowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance\r\nbefore the throne of King Harold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What terms,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98Lord King, hath thy brother Tosti to hope, if\r\nhe should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A brother\xe2\x80\x99s love,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the generous Harold, \xe2\x80\x98and the fair earldom\r\nof Northumberland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But should Tosti accept these terms,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the envoy, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nlands shall be assigned to his faithful ally, Hardrada, King of\r\nNorway?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Seven feet of English ground,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Harold, fiercely, \xe2\x80\x98or, as\r\nHardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to the\r\nNorwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his English\r\nterritory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have pledged him with all my soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cfor my\r\ntongue cleaves to my palate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe baffled envoy,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cedric, pursuing with animation his\r\ntale, though it interested not the listener, \xe2\x80\x9cretreated, to carry to\r\nTosti and his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. It was\r\nthen that the distant towers of York, and the bloody streams of the\r\nDerwent, 26 beheld that direful conflict, in which, after displaying\r\nthe most undaunted valour, the King of Norway, and Tosti, both fell,\r\nwith ten thousand of their bravest followers. Who would have thought\r\nthat upon the proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which\r\nwaved the Saxon banners in triumph, was filling the Norman sails, and\r\nimpelling them to the fatal shores of Sussex?\xe2\x80\x94Who would have thought\r\nthat Harold, within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of\r\nhis kingdom, than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the\r\nNorwegian invader?\xe2\x80\x94Who would have thought that you, noble\r\nAthelstane\xe2\x80\x94that you, descended of Harold\xe2\x80\x99s blood, and that I, whose\r\nfather was not the worst defender of the Saxon crown, should be\r\nprisoners to a vile Norman, in the very hall in which our ancestors\r\nheld such high festival?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is sad enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I trust they will hold us\r\nto a moderate ransom\xe2\x80\x94At any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve\r\nus outright; and yet, although it is high noon, I see no preparations\r\nfor serving dinner. Look up at the window, noble Cedric, and judge by\r\nthe sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I cannot look on that stained\r\nlattice without its awakening other reflections than those which\r\nconcern the passing moment, or its privations. When that window was\r\nwrought, my noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making\r\nglass, or of staining it\xe2\x80\x94The pride of Wolfganger\xe2\x80\x99s father brought an\r\nartist from Normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of\r\nemblazonment, that breaks the golden light of God\xe2\x80\x99s blessed day into so\r\nmany fantastic hues. The foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing,\r\nand subservient, ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the\r\nhousehold. He returned pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious\r\ncountrymen of the wealth and the simplicity of the Saxon nobles\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nfolly, oh, Athelstane, foreboded of old, as well as foreseen, by those\r\ndescendants of Hengist and his hardy tribes, who retained the\r\nsimplicity of their manners. We made these strangers our bosom friends,\r\nour confidential servants; we borrowed their artists and their arts,\r\nand despised the honest simplicity and hardihood with which our brave\r\nancestors supported themselves, and we became enervated by Norman arts\r\nlong ere we fell under Norman arms. Far better was our homely diet,\r\neaten in peace and liberty, than the luxurious dainties, the love of\r\nwhich hath delivered us as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9chold very humble diet a luxury at\r\npresent; and it astonishes me, noble Cedric, that you can bear so truly\r\nin mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very\r\nhour of dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time lost,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Cedric apart and impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cto speak to\r\nhim of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! The soul of\r\nHardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save\r\nto fill, to swill, and to call for more.\xe2\x80\x94Alas!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking at\r\nAthelstane with compassion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat so dull a spirit should be lodged in\r\nso goodly a form! Alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of\r\nEngland should turn on a hinge so imperfect! Wedded to Rowena, indeed,\r\nher nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which\r\nis torpid within him. Yet how should this be, while Rowena, Athelstane,\r\nand I myself, remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have\r\nbeen made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty\r\nmight bring to the usurped power of his nation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the Saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of\r\ntheir prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white\r\nrod of office. This important person advanced into the chamber with a\r\ngrave pace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a table covered\r\nwith dishes, the sight and smell of which seemed to be an instant\r\ncompensation to Athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone.\r\nThe persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mummery is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cthink you that we are ignorant\r\nwhose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master? Tell\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open a\r\nnegotiation for his freedom,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTell your master, Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\r\nthat we know no reason he can have for withholding our liberty,\r\nexcepting his unlawful desire to enrich himself at our expense. Tell\r\nhim that we yield to his rapacity, as in similar circumstances we\r\nshould do to that of a literal robber. Let him name the ransom at which\r\nhe rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is\r\nsuited to our means.\xe2\x80\x9d The sewer made no answer, but bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell Sir Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I send\r\nhim my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or\r\nhorseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation;\r\nwhich, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances,\r\nventure to refuse or to delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall deliver to the knight your defiance,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sewer;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmeanwhile I leave you to your food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe challenge of Athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a\r\nlarge mouthful, which required the exercise of both jaws at once, added\r\nto a natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold\r\ndefiance it contained. Still, however, his speech was hailed by Cedric\r\nas an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose\r\nprevious indifference had begun, notwithstanding his respect for\r\nAthelstane\xe2\x80\x99s descent, to wear out his patience. But he now cordially\r\nshook hands with him in token of his approbation, and was somewhat\r\ngrieved when Athelstane observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he would fight a dozen such men\r\nas Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, if, by so doing, he could hasten his departure from a\r\ndungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nNotwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of\r\nsensuality, Cedric placed himself opposite to Athelstane, and soon\r\nshowed, that if the distresses of his country could banish the\r\nrecollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were\r\nthe victuals put there, than he proved that the appetite of his Saxon\r\nancestors had descended to him along with their other qualities.\r\n\r\nThe captives had not long enjoyed their refreshment, however, ere their\r\nattention was disturbed even from this most serious occupation by the\r\nblast of a horn winded before the gate. It was repeated three times,\r\nwith as much violence as if it had been blown before an enchanted\r\ncastle by the destined knight, at whose summons halls and towers,\r\nbarbican and battlement, were to roll off like a morning vapour. The\r\nSaxons started from the table, and hastened to the window. But their\r\ncuriosity was disappointed; for these outlets only looked upon the\r\ncourt of the castle, and the sound came from beyond its precincts. The\r\nsummons, however, seemed of importance, for a considerable degree of\r\nbustle instantly took place in the castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nMy daughter\xe2\x80\x94O my ducats\xe2\x80\x94O my daughter!\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94O my Christian ducats!\r\nJustice\xe2\x80\x94the Law\xe2\x80\x94my ducats, and my daughter!\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCHANT OF VENICE\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the Saxon chiefs to return to their banquet as soon as their\r\nungratified curiosity should permit them to attend to the calls of\r\ntheir half-satiated appetite, we have to look in upon the yet more\r\nsevere imprisonment of Isaac of York. The poor Jew had been hastily\r\nthrust into a dungeon-vault of the castle, the floor of which was deep\r\nbeneath the level of the ground, and very damp, being lower than even\r\nthe moat itself. The only light was received through one or two\r\nloop-holes far above the reach of the captive\xe2\x80\x99s hand. These apertures\r\nadmitted, even at mid-day, only a dim and uncertain light, which was\r\nchanged for utter darkness long before the rest of the castle had lost\r\nthe blessing of day. Chains and shackles, which had been the portion of\r\nformer captives, from whom active exertions to escape had been\r\napprehended, hung rusted and empty on the walls of the prison, and in\r\nthe rings of one of those sets of fetters there remained two mouldering\r\nbones, which seemed to have been once those of the human leg, as if\r\nsome prisoner had been left not only to perish there, but to be\r\nconsumed to a skeleton.\r\n\r\nAt one end of this ghastly apartment was a large fire-grate, over the\r\ntop of which were stretched some transverse iron bars, half devoured\r\nwith rust.\r\n\r\nThe whole appearance of the dungeon might have appalled a stouter heart\r\nthan that of Isaac, who, nevertheless, was more composed under the\r\nimminent pressure of danger, than he had seemed to be while affected by\r\nterrors, of which the cause was as yet remote and contingent. The\r\nlovers of the chase say that the hare feels more agony during the\r\npursuit of the greyhounds, than when she is struggling in their fangs.\r\n27\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is probable, that the Jews, by the very frequency of their\r\nfear on all occasions, had their minds in some degree prepared for\r\nevery effort of tyranny which could be practised upon them; so that no\r\naggression, when it had taken place, could bring with it that surprise\r\nwhich is the most disabling quality of terror. Neither was it the first\r\ntime that Isaac had been placed in circumstances so dangerous. He had\r\ntherefore experience to guide him, as well as hope, that he might\r\nagain, as formerly, be delivered as a prey from the fowler. Above all,\r\nhe had upon his side the unyielding obstinacy of his nation, and that\r\nunbending resolution, with which Israelites have been frequently known\r\nto submit to the uttermost evils which power and violence can inflict\r\nupon them, rather than gratify their oppressors by granting their\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nIn this humour of passive resistance, and with his garment collected\r\nbeneath him to keep his limbs from the wet pavement, Isaac sat in a\r\ncorner of his dungeon, where his folded hands, his dishevelled hair and\r\nbeard, his furred cloak and high cap, seen by the wiry and broken\r\nlight, would have afforded a study for Rembrandt, had that celebrated\r\npainter existed at the period. The Jew remained, without altering his\r\nposition, for nearly three hours, at the expiry of which steps were\r\nheard on the dungeon stair. The bolts screamed as they were\r\nwithdrawn\xe2\x80\x94the hinges creaked as the wicket opened, and Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, followed by the two Saracen slaves of the Templar,\r\nentered the prison.\r\n\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, a tall and strong man, whose life had been spent in\r\npublic war or in private feuds and broils, and who had hesitated at no\r\nmeans of extending his feudal power, had features corresponding to his\r\ncharacter, and which strongly expressed the fiercer and more malignant\r\npassions of the mind. The scars with which his visage was seamed,\r\nwould, on features of a different cast, have excited the sympathy and\r\nveneration due to the marks of honourable valour; but, in the peculiar\r\ncase of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, they only added to the ferocity of his\r\ncountenance, and to the dread which his presence inspired. This\r\nformidable baron was clad in a leathern doublet, fitted close to his\r\nbody, which was frayed and soiled with the stains of his armour. He had\r\nno weapon, excepting a poniard at his belt, which served to\r\ncounterbalance the weight of the bunch of rusty keys that hung at his\r\nright side.\r\n\r\nThe black slaves who attended Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf were stripped of their\r\ngorgeous apparel, and attired in jerkins and trowsers of coarse linen,\r\ntheir sleeves being tucked up above the elbow, like those of butchers\r\nwhen about to exercise their function in the slaughter-house. Each had\r\nin his hand a small pannier; and, when they entered the dungeon, they\r\nstopt at the door until Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf himself carefully locked and\r\ndouble-locked it. Having taken this precaution, he advanced slowly up\r\nthe apartment towards the Jew, upon whom he kept his eye fixed, as if\r\nhe wished to paralyze him with his glance, as some animals are said to\r\nfascinate their prey. It seemed indeed as if the sullen and malignant\r\neye of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf possessed some portion of that supposed power over\r\nhis unfortunate prisoner. The Jew sat with his mouth agape, and his\r\neyes fixed on the savage baron with such earnestness of terror, that\r\nhis frame seemed literally to shrink together, and to diminish in size\r\nwhile encountering the fierce Norman\xe2\x80\x99s fixed and baleful gaze. The\r\nunhappy Isaac was deprived not only of the power of rising to make the\r\nobeisance which his terror dictated, but he could not even doff his\r\ncap, or utter any word of supplication; so strongly was he agitated by\r\nthe conviction that tortures and death were impending over him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the stately form of the Norman appeared to dilate in\r\nmagnitude, like that of the eagle, which ruffles up its plumage when\r\nabout to pounce on its defenceless prey. He paused within three steps\r\nof the corner in which the unfortunate Jew had now, as it were, coiled\r\nhimself up into the smallest possible space, and made a sign for one of\r\nthe slaves to approach. The black satellite came forward accordingly,\r\nand, producing from his basket a large pair of scales and several\r\nweights, he laid them at the feet of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, and again retired\r\nto the respectful distance, at which his companion had already taken\r\nhis station.\r\n\r\nThe motions of these men were slow and solemn, as if there impended\r\nover their souls some preconception of horror and of cruelty.\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf himself opened the scene by thus addressing his ill-fated\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost accursed dog of an accursed race,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, awaking with his deep\r\nand sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, \xe2\x80\x9cseest thou\r\nthese scales?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Jew returned a feeble affirmative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn these very scales shalt thou weigh me out,\xe2\x80\x9d said the relentless\r\nBaron, \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of\r\nthe Tower of London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Abraham!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Jew, finding voice through the very\r\nextremity of his danger, \xe2\x80\x9cheard man ever such a demand?\xe2\x80\x94Who ever heard,\r\neven in a minstrel\xe2\x80\x99s tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds of\r\nsilver?\xe2\x80\x94What human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such a\r\nmass of treasure?\xe2\x80\x94Not within the walls of York, ransack my house and\r\nthat of all my tribe, wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of\r\nsilver that thou speakest of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cand if silver be scant, I\r\nrefuse not gold. At the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of\r\nsilver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as\r\nthy heart has never even conceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave mercy on me, noble knight!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cI am old, and poor,\r\nand helpless. It were unworthy to triumph over me\xe2\x80\x94It is a poor deed to\r\ncrush a worm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld thou mayst be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cmore shame to their folly who\r\nhave suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery\xe2\x80\x94Feeble thou mayst\r\nbe, for when had a Jew either heart or hand\xe2\x80\x94But rich it is well known\r\nthou art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you, noble knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew \xe2\x80\x9cby all which I believe,\r\nand by all which we believe in common\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerjure not thyself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Norman, interrupting him, \xe2\x80\x9cand let not\r\nthine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well considered\r\nthe fate that awaits thee. Think not I speak to thee only to excite thy\r\nterror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy\r\ntribe. I swear to thee by that which thou dost NOT believe, by the\r\ngospel which our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to\r\nbind and to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. This dungeon\r\nis no place for trifling. Prisoners ten thousand times more\r\ndistinguished than thou have died within these walls, and their fate\r\nhath never been known! But for thee is reserved a long and lingering\r\ndeath, to which theirs were luxury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them\r\napart, in their own language; for he also had been in Palestine, where\r\nperhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. The Saracens produced\r\nfrom their baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a\r\nflask of oil. While the one struck a light with a flint and steel, the\r\nother disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have\r\nalready mentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a\r\nred glow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeest thou, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of iron bars above\r\nthe glowing charcoal?\xe2\x80\x94 28 on that warm couch thou shalt lie, stripped\r\nof thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. One of these\r\nslaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the other shall\r\nanoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn.\xe2\x80\x94Now,\r\nchoose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand\r\npounds of silver; for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other\r\noption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the miserable Jew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is impossible that\r\nyour purpose can be real! The good God of nature never made a heart\r\ncapable of exercising such cruelty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust not to that, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cit were a fatal error.\r\nDost thou think that I, who have seen a town sacked, in which thousands\r\nof my Christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire,\r\nwill blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single\r\nwretched Jew?\xe2\x80\x94or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have\r\nneither law, country, nor conscience, but their master\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94who use\r\nthe poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest\r\nwink\xe2\x80\x94thinkest thou that THEY will have mercy, who do not even\r\nunderstand the language in which it is asked?\xe2\x80\x94Be wise, old man;\r\ndischarge thyself of a portion of thy superfluous wealth; repay to the\r\nhands of a Christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury\r\nthou hast practised on those of his religion. Thy cunning may soon\r\nswell out once more thy shrivelled purse, but neither leech nor\r\nmedicine can restore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou once\r\nstretched on these bars. Tell down thy ransom, I say, and rejoice that\r\nat such rate thou canst redeem thee from a dungeon, the secrets of\r\nwhich few have returned to tell. I waste no more words with thee\xe2\x80\x94choose\r\nbetween thy dross and thy flesh and blood, and as thou choosest, so\r\nshall it be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo may Abraham, Jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot make the choice, because I have not the means of\r\nsatisfying your exorbitant demand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeize him and strip him, slaves,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cand let the\r\nfathers of his race assist him if they can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe assistants, taking their directions more from the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s eye and\r\nhis hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the\r\nunfortunate Isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him\r\nbetween them, waited the hard-hearted Baron\xe2\x80\x99s farther signal. The\r\nunhappy Jew eyed their countenances and that of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, in hope\r\nof discovering some symptoms of relenting; but that of the Baron\r\nexhibited the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had\r\nbeen the prelude to his cruelty; and the savage eyes of the Saracens,\r\nrolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister\r\nexpression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil,\r\nevinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the\r\napproaching scene, than any reluctance to be its directors or agents.\r\nThe Jew then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently\r\nto be stretched, and seeing no chance of his tormentor\xe2\x80\x99s relenting, his\r\nresolution gave way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will pay,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe thousand pounds of silver\xe2\x80\x94That is,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay it with the help of my\r\nbrethren; for I must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue\r\nere I make up so unheard-of a sum.\xe2\x80\x94When and where must it be\r\ndelivered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9chere it must be delivered\xe2\x80\x94weighed it\r\nmust be\xe2\x80\x94weighed and told down on this very dungeon floor.\xe2\x80\x94Thinkest thou\r\nI will part with thee until thy ransom is secure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is to be my surety,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I shall be at\r\nliberty after this ransom is paid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe word of a Norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cthe faith of a Norman nobleman, more pure than the gold\r\nand silver of thee and all thy tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crave pardon, noble lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut wherefore should\r\nI rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause thou canst not help it, Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWert\r\nthou now in thy treasure-chamber at York, and were I craving a loan of\r\nthy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the\r\npledge of security. This is MY treasure-chamber. Here I have thee at\r\nadvantage, nor will I again deign to repeat the terms on which I grant\r\nthee liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew groaned deeply.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGrant me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cat least with my own\r\nliberty, that of the companions with whom I travel. They scorned me as\r\na Jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid\r\nme by the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them; moreover, they\r\nmay contribute in some sort to my ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou meanest yonder Saxon churls,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\r\nransom will depend upon other terms than thine. Mind thine own\r\nconcerns, Jew, I warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9conly to be set at liberty, together with\r\nmine wounded friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I twice recommend it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cto a son of Israel,\r\nto meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others alone?\xe2\x80\x94Since\r\nthou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy\r\nransom, and that at a short day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet hear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor the sake of that very wealth which\r\nthou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d Here he stopt short,\r\nafraid of irritating the savage Norman. But Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf only laughed,\r\nand himself filled up the blank at which the Jew had hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, Isaac; speak it\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94I tell thee, I am reasonable. I can bear the reproaches of a loser,\r\neven when that loser is a Jew. Thou wert not so patient, Isaac, when\r\nthou didst invoke justice against Jacques Fitzdotterel, for calling\r\nthee a usurious blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his\r\npatrimony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear by the Talmud,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your valour has been\r\nmisled in that matter. Fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine\r\nown chamber, because I craved him for mine own silver. The term of\r\npayment was due at the Passover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care not what he did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cthe question is, when\r\nshall I have mine own?\xe2\x80\x94when shall I have the shekels, Isaac?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet my daughter Rebecca go forth to York,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your\r\nsafe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return,\r\nthe treasure\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d Here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a\r\nfew seconds,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe treasure shall be told down on this very floor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, as if surprised,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBy heavens,\r\nIsaac, I would I had known of this. I deemed that yonder black-browed\r\ngirl had been thy concubine, and I gave her to be a handmaiden to Sir\r\nBrian de Bois-Guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of\r\nthe days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yell which Isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the\r\nvery vault to ring, and astounded the two Saracens so much that they\r\nlet go their hold of the Jew. He availed himself of his enlargement to\r\nthrow himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake all that you have asked,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight\xe2\x80\x94take ten times\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt,\xe2\x80\x94nay, pierce me\r\nwith thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my daughter,\r\ndeliver her in safety and honour!\xe2\x80\x94As thou art born of woman, spare the\r\nhonour of a helpless maiden\xe2\x80\x94She is the image of my deceased Rachel, she\r\nis the last of six pledges of her love\xe2\x80\x94Will you deprive a widowed\r\nhusband of his sole remaining comfort?\xe2\x80\x94Will you reduce a father to wish\r\nthat his only living child were laid beside her dead mother, in the\r\ntomb of our fathers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Norman, somewhat relenting, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had known of\r\nthis before. I thought your race had loved nothing save their\r\nmoneybags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not so vilely of us, Jews though we be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, eager to\r\nimprove the moment of apparent sympathy; \xe2\x80\x9cthe hunted fox, the tortured\r\nwildcat loves its young\xe2\x80\x94the despised and persecuted race of Abraham\r\nlove their children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cI will believe it in future, Isaac,\r\nfor thy very sake\xe2\x80\x94but it aids us not now, I cannot help what has\r\nhappened, or what is to follow; my word is passed to my comrade in\r\narms, nor would I break it for ten Jews and Jewesses to boot. Besides,\r\nwhy shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became\r\nBois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x99s booty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will, there must!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Isaac, wringing his hands in agony;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen did Templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour to\r\nwomen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDog of an infidel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, with sparkling eyes, and not\r\nsorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cblaspheme not the Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, but take thought\r\ninstead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy\r\nJewish throat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobber and villain!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, retorting the insults of his\r\noppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it\r\nimpossible to bridle, \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay thee nothing\xe2\x80\x94not one silver penny\r\nwill I pay thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and\r\nhonour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou in thy senses, Israelite?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Norman, sternly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chas thy\r\nflesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care not!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo thy worst. My daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me a\r\nthousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. No silver\r\nwill I give thee, unless I were to pour it molten down thy avaricious\r\nthroat\xe2\x80\x94no, not a silver penny will I give thee, Nazarene, were it to\r\nsave thee from the deep damnation thy whole life has merited! Take my\r\nlife if thou wilt, and say, the Jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to\r\ndisappoint the Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cfor by the blessed rood,\r\nwhich is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the\r\nextremities of fire and steel!\xe2\x80\x94Strip him, slaves, and chain him down\r\nupon the bars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the Saracens had\r\nalready torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to\r\ndisrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the\r\ncastle, penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately\r\nafter loud voices were heard calling for Sir Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\r\nUnwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage\r\nBaron gave the slaves a signal to restore Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s garment, and,\r\nquitting the dungeon with his attendants, he left the Jew to thank God\r\nfor his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s captivity,\r\nand probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove\r\nstrongest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNay, if the gentle spirit of moving words\r\nCan no way change you to a milder form,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll woo you, like a soldier, at arms\xe2\x80\x99 end,\r\nAnd love you \xe2\x80\x99gainst the nature of love, force you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apartment to which the Lady Rowena had been introduced was fitted\r\nup with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being\r\nplaced there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not\r\noffered to the other prisoners. But the wife of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, for whom\r\nit had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect\r\nhad impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it. The\r\ntapestry hung down from the walls in many places, and in others was\r\ntarnished and faded under the effects of the sun, or tattered and\r\ndecayed by age. Desolate, however, as it was, this was the apartment of\r\nthe castle which had been judged most fitting for the accommodation of\r\nthe Saxon heiress; and here she was left to meditate upon her fate,\r\nuntil the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts\r\nwhich each of them was to perform. This had been settled in a council\r\nheld by Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, De Bracy, and the Templar, in which, after a\r\nlong and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each\r\ninsisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious\r\nenterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIt was about the hour of noon, therefore, when De Bracy, for whose\r\nadvantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute\r\nhis views upon the hand and possessions of the Lady Rowena.\r\n\r\nThe interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his\r\nconfederates, for De Bracy had found leisure to decorate his person\r\nwith all the foppery of the times. His green cassock and vizard were\r\nnow flung aside. His long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint\r\ntresses down his richly furred cloak. His beard was closely shaved, his\r\ndoublet reached to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured\r\nit, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered\r\nand embossed with gold work. We have already noticed the extravagant\r\nfashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of Maurice de\r\nBracy\xe2\x80\x99s might have challenged the prize of extravagance with the\r\ngayest, being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. Such was\r\nthe dress of a gallant of the period; and, in the present instance,\r\nthat effect was aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the\r\nwearer, whose manners partook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the\r\nfrankness of a soldier.\r\n\r\nHe saluted Rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden\r\nbroach, representing St Michael trampling down the Prince of Evil. With\r\nthis, he gently motioned the lady to a seat; and, as she still retained\r\nher standing posture, the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned\r\nto conduct her thither. But Rowena declined, by her gesture, the\r\nproffered compliment, and replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I be in the presence of my\r\njailor, Sir Knight\xe2\x80\x94nor will circumstances allow me to think\r\notherwise\xe2\x80\x94it best becomes his prisoner to remain standing till she\r\nlearns her doom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! fair Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d returned De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are in presence of your\r\ncaptive, not your jailor; and it is from your fair eyes that De Bracy\r\nmust receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, drawing herself up with all the\r\npride of offended rank and beauty; \xe2\x80\x9cI know you not\xe2\x80\x94and the insolent\r\nfamiliarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour,\r\nforms no apology for the violence of a robber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo thyself, fair maid,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy, in his former tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nthine own charms be ascribed whate\xe2\x80\x99er I have done which passed the\r\nrespect due to her, whom I have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar\r\nof my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat to you, Sir Knight, that I know you not, and that no man\r\nwearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence\r\nof an unprotected lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am unknown to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cis indeed my misfortune;\r\nyet let me hope that De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s name has not been always unspoken, when\r\nminstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the\r\nlists or in the battle-field.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cmore suiting for their mouths than for thine own; and\r\ntell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the\r\nmemorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man,\r\nfollowed by a few timid hinds; and its booty, an unfortunate maiden,\r\ntransported against her will to the castle of a robber?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are unjust, Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, biting his lips in some\r\nconfusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of\r\naffected gallantry, which he had at first adopted; \xe2\x80\x9cyourself free from\r\npassion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although\r\ncaused by your own beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray you, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cto cease a language so commonly\r\nused by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights\r\nor nobles. Certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon\r\nsuch commonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that\r\nmight last from hence to Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud damsel,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, incensed at finding his gallant style\r\nprocured him nothing but contempt\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cproud damsel, thou shalt be as\r\nproudly encountered. Know then, that I have supported my pretensions to\r\nyour hand in the way that best suited thy character. It is meeter for\r\nthy humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in\r\ncourtly language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourtesy of tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it is used to veil\r\nchurlishness of deed, is but a knight\xe2\x80\x99s girdle around the breast of a\r\nbase clown. I wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you\xe2\x80\x94more it\r\nwere for your honour to have retained the dress and language of an\r\noutlaw, than to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle\r\nlanguage and demeanour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou counsel well, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Norman; \xe2\x80\x9cand in the bold language\r\nwhich best justifies bold action I tell thee, thou shalt never leave\r\nthis castle, or thou shalt leave it as Maurice de Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s wife. I am\r\nnot wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a Norman noble\r\nscrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the Saxon maiden whom he\r\ndistinguishes by the offer of his hand. Thou art proud, Rowena, and\r\nthou art the fitter to be my wife. By what other means couldst thou be\r\nraised to high honour and to princely place, saving by my alliance? How\r\nelse wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange,\r\nwhere Saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to take thy\r\nseat, honoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in England\r\nthat is distinguished by beauty, or dignified by power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cthe grange which you contemn hath been\r\nmy shelter from infancy; and, trust me, when I leave it\xe2\x80\x94should that day\r\never arrive\xe2\x80\x94it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the\r\ndwelling and manners in which I have been brought up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess your meaning, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthough you may think it\r\nlies too obscure for my apprehension. But dream not, that Richard C\xc5\x93ur\r\nde Lion will ever resume his throne, far less that Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\r\nhis minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed\r\nas the bride of a favourite. Another suitor might feel jealousy while\r\nhe touched this string; but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a\r\npassion so childish and so hopeless. Know, lady, that this rival is in\r\nmy power, and that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his\r\nbeing within the castle to Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, whose jealousy will be more\r\nfatal than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilfred here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, in disdain; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is as true as that\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf is his rival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Bracy looked at her steadily for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWert thou really ignorant of this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cdidst thou not know that\r\nWilfred of Ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the Jew?\xe2\x80\x94a meet\r\nconveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the\r\nHoly Sepulchre!\xe2\x80\x9d And he laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he is here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, compelling herself to a tone of\r\nindifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she\r\ncould not suppress, \xe2\x80\x9cin what is he the rival of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf? or what\r\nhas he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom,\r\naccording to the use of chivalry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cart thou, too, deceived by the common error\r\nof thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their\r\nown charms? Knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of\r\nwealth, as well as of love; and that this our host, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, will\r\npush from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of\r\nIvanhoe, as readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were\r\npreferred to him by some blue-eyed damsel? But smile on my suit, lady,\r\nand the wounded champion shall have nothing to fear from Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\r\nwhom else thou mayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never\r\nshown compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave him, for the love of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, her firmness giving\r\nway under terror for her lover\xe2\x80\x99s impending fate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x94I will\xe2\x80\x94it is my purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, when Rowena\r\nconsents to be the bride of De Bracy, who is it shall dare to put forth\r\na violent hand upon her kinsman\xe2\x80\x94the son of her guardian\xe2\x80\x94the companion\r\nof her youth? But it is thy love must buy his protection. I am not\r\nromantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one\r\nwho is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes. Use\r\nthine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe,\xe2\x80\x94refuse to employ\r\nit, Wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy language,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9chath in its indifferent bluntness\r\nsomething which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to\r\nexpress. I believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so\r\ngreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlatter thyself, then, with that belief,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil time\r\nshall prove it false. Thy lover lies wounded in this castle\xe2\x80\x94thy\r\npreferred lover. He is a bar betwixt Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and that which\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf loves better than either ambition or beauty. What will it\r\ncost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to\r\nsilence his opposition for ever? Nay, were Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf afraid to\r\njustify a deed so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong\r\ndraught\xe2\x80\x94let the chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, but pluck the\r\npillow from his head, and Wilfred in his present condition, is sped\r\nwithout the effusion of blood. Cedric also\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Cedric also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, repeating his words; \xe2\x80\x9cmy noble\xe2\x80\x94my\r\ngenerous guardian! I deserved the evil I have encountered, for\r\nforgetting his fate even in that of his son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCedric\xe2\x80\x99s fate also depends upon thy determination,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I leave thee to form it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHitherto, Rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with\r\nundismayed courage, but it was because she had not considered the\r\ndanger as serious and imminent. Her disposition was naturally that\r\nwhich physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions, mild,\r\ntimid, and gentle; but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened,\r\nby the circumstances of her education. Accustomed to see the will of\r\nall, even of Cedric himself, (sufficiently arbitrary with others,) give\r\nway before her wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and\r\nself-confidence which arises from the habitual and constant deference\r\nof the circle in which we move. She could scarce conceive the\r\npossibility of her will being opposed, far less that of its being\r\ntreated with total disregard.\r\n\r\nHer haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious\r\ncharacter, induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted\r\nher when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well\r\nas that of her lover and her guardian; and when she found her will, the\r\nslightest expression of which was wont to command respect and\r\nattention, now placed in opposition to that of a man of a strong,\r\nfierce, and determined mind, who possessed the advantage over her, and\r\nwas resolved to use it, she quailed before him.\r\n\r\nAfter casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was\r\nnowhere to be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised\r\nher hands to heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation\r\nand sorrow. It was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such\r\nextremity without feeling for her, and De Bracy was not unmoved, though\r\nhe was yet more embarrassed than touched. He had, in truth, gone too\r\nfar to recede; and yet, in Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s present condition, she could not be\r\nacted on either by argument or threats. He paced the apartment to and\r\nfro, now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself, now\r\nhesitating concerning his own line of conduct.\r\n\r\nIf, thought he, I should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this\r\ndisconsolate damsel, what should I reap but the loss of these fair\r\nhopes for which I have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of\r\nPrince John and his jovial comrades? \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nfeel myself ill framed for the part which I am playing. I cannot look\r\non so fair a face while it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes\r\nwhen they are drowned in tears. I would she had retained her original\r\nhaughtiness of disposition, or that I had a larger share of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s thrice-tempered hardness of heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate Rowena be\r\ncomforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the excess\r\nof despair to which she was now giving way. But in this task of\r\nconsolation De Bracy was interrupted by the horn, \xe2\x80\x9choarse-winded\r\nblowing far and keen,\xe2\x80\x9d which had at the same time alarmed the other\r\ninmates of the castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice\r\nand of license. Of them all, perhaps, De Bracy least regretted the\r\ninterruption; for his conference with the Lady Rowena had arrived at a\r\npoint, where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign\r\nhis enterprise.\r\n\r\nAnd here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof\r\nthan the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy\r\nrepresentation of manners which has been just laid before the reader.\r\nIt is grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose stand\r\nagainst the crown the liberties of England were indebted for their\r\nexistence, should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors, and\r\ncapable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of England, but to\r\nthose of nature and humanity. But, alas! we have only to extract from\r\nthe industrious Henry one of those numerous passages which he has\r\ncollected from contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself\r\ncan hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period.\r\n\r\nThe description given by the author of the Saxon Chronicle of the\r\ncruelties exercised in the reign of King Stephen by the great barons\r\nand lords of castles, who were all Normans, affords a strong proof of\r\nthe excesses of which they were capable when their passions were\r\ninflamed. \xe2\x80\x9cThey grievously oppressed the poor people by building\r\ncastles; and when they were built, they filled them with wicked men, or\r\nrather devils, who seized both men and women who they imagined had any\r\nmoney, threw them into prison, and put them to more cruel tortures than\r\nthe martyrs ever endured. They suffocated some in mud, and suspended\r\nothers by the feet, or the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below\r\nthem. They squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they\r\npierced their brains, while they threw others into dungeons swarming\r\nwith serpents, snakes, and toads.\xe2\x80\x9d But it would be cruel to put the\r\nreader to the pain of perusing the remainder of this description. 29\r\n\r\nAs another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the\r\nstrongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the Princess\r\nMatilda, though a daughter of the King of Scotland, and afterwards both\r\nQueen of England, niece to Edgar Atheling, and mother to the Empress of\r\nGermany, the daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was\r\nobliged, during her early residence for education in England, to assume\r\nthe veil of a nun, as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit\r\nof the Norman nobles. This excuse she stated before a great council of\r\nthe clergy of England, as the sole reason for her having taken the\r\nreligious habit. The assembled clergy admitted the validity of the\r\nplea, and the notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded;\r\ngiving thus an indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the\r\nexistence of that disgraceful license by which that age was stained. It\r\nwas a matter of public knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of\r\nKing William, his Norman followers, elated by so great a victory,\r\nacknowledged no law but their own wicked pleasure, and not only\r\ndespoiled the conquered Saxons of their lands and their goods, but\r\ninvaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters with the most\r\nunbridled license; and hence it was then common for matrons and maidens\r\nof noble families to assume the veil, and take shelter in convents, not\r\nas called thither by the vocation of God, but solely to preserve their\r\nhonour from the unbridled wickedness of man.\r\n\r\nSuch and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public\r\ndeclaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by Eadmer; and we need\r\nadd nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we\r\nhave detailed, and are about to detail, upon the more apocryphal\r\nauthority of the Wardour MS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll woo her as the lion woos his bride.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the\r\ncastle, the Jewess Rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and\r\nsequestered turret. Hither she had been led by two of her disguised\r\nravishers, and on being thrust into the little cell, she found herself\r\nin the presence of an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a Saxon\r\nrhyme, as if to beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was\r\nperforming upon the floor. The hag raised her head as Rebecca entered,\r\nand scowled at the fair Jewess with the malignant envy with which old\r\nage and ugliness, when united with evil conditions, are apt to look\r\nupon youth and beauty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou must up and away, old house-cricket,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men; \xe2\x80\x9cour\r\nnoble master commands it\xe2\x80\x94Thou must e\xe2\x80\x99en leave this chamber to a fairer\r\nguest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the hag, \xe2\x80\x9ceven thus is service requited. I have known\r\nwhen my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out of\r\nsaddle and out of service; and now must I up and away at the command of\r\nevery groom such as thou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Dame Urfried,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other man, \xe2\x80\x9cstand not to reason on it,\r\nbut up and away. Lords\xe2\x80\x99 hests must be listened to with a quick ear.\r\nThou hast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. Thou\r\nart now the very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren\r\nheath\xe2\x80\x94thou hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is\r\nthe best of them\xe2\x80\x94Come, amble off with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll omens dog ye both!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman; \xe2\x80\x9cand a kennel be your\r\nburying-place! May the evil demon Zernebock tear me limb from limb, if\r\nI leave my own cell ere I have spun out the hemp on my distaff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer it to our lord, then, old housefiend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, and\r\nretired; leaving Rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose\r\npresence she had been thus unwillingly forced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat devil\xe2\x80\x99s deed have they now in the wind?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old hag,\r\nmurmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and\r\nmalignant glance at Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is easy to guess\xe2\x80\x94Bright eyes,\r\nblack locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his\r\nblack unguent\xe2\x80\x94Ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone\r\nturret, whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of\r\nfive hundred fathoms beneath the earth.\xe2\x80\x94Thou wilt have owls for thy\r\nneighbours, fair one; and their screams will be heard as far, and as\r\nmuch regarded, as thine own. Outlandish, too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, marking the\r\ndress and turban of Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat country art thou of?\xe2\x80\x94a Saracen? or an\r\nEgyptian?\xe2\x80\x94Why dost not answer?\xe2\x80\x94thou canst weep, canst thou not speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe not angry, good mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou needst say no more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Urfried \xe2\x80\x9cmen know a fox by the\r\ntrain, and a Jewess by her tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the sake of mercy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me what I am to expect as\r\nthe conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! Is it my\r\nlife they seek, to atone for my religion? I will lay it down\r\ncheerfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy life, minion?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sibyl; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would taking thy life\r\npleasure them?\xe2\x80\x94Trust me, thy life is in no peril. Such usage shalt thou\r\nhave as was once thought good enough for a noble Saxon maiden. And\r\nshall a Jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better? Look at\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94I was as young and twice as fair as thou, when Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, father\r\nof this Reginald, and his Normans, stormed this castle. My father and\r\nhis seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from\r\nchamber to chamber\xe2\x80\x94There was not a room, not a step of the stair, that\r\nwas not slippery with their blood. They died\xe2\x80\x94they died every man; and\r\nere their bodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, I had become\r\nthe prey and the scorn of the conqueror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no help?\xe2\x80\x94Are there no means of escape?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRichly,\r\nrichly would I requite thine aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the hag; \xe2\x80\x9cfrom hence there is no escape but\r\nthrough the gates of death; and it is late, late,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, shaking\r\nher grey head, \xe2\x80\x9cere these open to us\xe2\x80\x94Yet it is comfort to think that we\r\nleave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves. Fare\r\nthee well, Jewess!\xe2\x80\x94Jew or Gentile, thy fate would be the same; for thou\r\nhast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. Fare thee\r\nwell, I say. My thread is spun out\xe2\x80\x94thy task is yet to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay! stay! for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cstay, though it be to\r\ncurse and to revile me\xe2\x80\x94thy presence is yet some protection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe presence of the mother of God were no protection,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nold woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she stands,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to a rude image of the Virgin\r\nMary, \xe2\x80\x9csee if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of\r\nsneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their\r\nhabitual frown. She locked the door behind her, and Rebecca might hear\r\nher curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty\r\nshe descended the turret-stair.\r\n\r\nRebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of\r\nRowena; for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony\r\nwould be used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of\r\nthese might be preserved towards a Saxon heiress? Yet had the Jewess\r\nthis advantage, that she was better prepared by habits of thought, and\r\nby natural strength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was\r\nexposed. Of a strong and observing character, even from her earliest\r\nyears, the pomp and wealth which her father displayed within his walls,\r\nor which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy Hebrews, had not\r\nbeen able to blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they\r\nwere enjoyed. Like Damocles at his celebrated banquet, Rebecca\r\nperpetually beheld, amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was\r\nsuspended over the heads of her people by a single hair. These\r\nreflections had tamed and brought down to a pitch of sounder judgment a\r\ntemper, which, under other circumstances, might have waxed haughty,\r\nsupercilious, and obstinate.\r\n\r\nFrom her father\xe2\x80\x99s example and injunctions, Rebecca had learnt to bear\r\nherself courteously towards all who approached her. She could not\r\nindeed imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger\r\nto the meanness of mind, and to the constant state of timid\r\napprehension, by which it was dictated; but she bore herself with a\r\nproud humility, as if submitting to the evil circumstances in which she\r\nwas placed as the daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her\r\nmind the consciousness that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from\r\nher merit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice\r\npermitted her to aspire to.\r\n\r\nThus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the\r\nfirmness necessary for acting under them. Her present situation\r\nrequired all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.\r\n\r\nHer first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes\r\neither of escape or protection. It contained neither secret passage nor\r\ntrap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined\r\nthe main building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior\r\nwall of the turret. The door had no inside bolt or bar. The single\r\nwindow opened upon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which\r\ngave Rebecca, at first sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon\r\nfound it had no communication with any other part of the battlements,\r\nbeing an isolated bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a\r\nparapet, with embrasures, at which a few archers might be stationed for\r\ndefending the turret, and flanking with their shot the wall of the\r\ncastle on that side.\r\n\r\nThere was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that\r\nstrong reliance on Heaven natural to great and generous characters.\r\nRebecca, however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of\r\nScripture to the chosen people of Heaven, did not err in supposing the\r\npresent to be their hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of\r\nZion would be one day called in with the fulness of the Gentiles. In\r\nthe meanwhile, all around her showed that their present state was that\r\nof punishment and probation, and that it was their especial duty to\r\nsuffer without sinning. Thus prepared to consider herself as the victim\r\nof misfortune, Rebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and\r\nschooled her mind to meet the dangers which she had probably to\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was\r\nheard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened,\r\nand a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed\r\ntheir misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his\r\ncap, pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face,\r\nand he held his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest. In this\r\nguise, as if prepared for the execution of some deed, at the thought of\r\nwhich he was himself ashamed, he stood before the affrighted prisoner;\r\nyet, ruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express\r\nwhat purpose had brought him thither, so that Rebecca, making an effort\r\nupon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. She had already\r\nunclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to\r\nproffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify\r\nhis avarice was to bespeak his favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake these,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cgood friend, and for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake be merciful to\r\nme and my aged father! These ornaments are of value, yet are they\r\ntrifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this\r\ncastle, free and uninjured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair flower of Palestine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cthese pearls are\r\norient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are\r\nbrilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since I have taken\r\nup this wild trade, I have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not do yourself such wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9ctake ransom, and have\r\nmercy!\xe2\x80\x94Gold will purchase you pleasure,\xe2\x80\x94to misuse us, could only bring\r\nthee remorse. My father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes; and\r\nif thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy\r\nrestoration to civil society\xe2\x80\x94mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and\r\nbe placed beyond the necessity of committing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the outlaw in French, finding it difficult\r\nprobably to sustain, in Saxon, a conversation which Rebecca had opened\r\nin that language; \xe2\x80\x9cbut know, bright lily of the vale of Baca! that thy\r\nfather is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how\r\nto convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate.\r\nThe venerable Isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from\r\nhim all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy\r\nentreaty. The ransom must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other\r\ncoin will I accept it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art no outlaw,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, in the same language in which he\r\naddressed her; \xe2\x80\x9cno outlaw had refused such offers. No outlaw in this\r\nland uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. Thou art no outlaw,\r\nbut a Norman\xe2\x80\x94a Norman, noble perhaps in birth\xe2\x80\x94O, be so in thy actions,\r\nand cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou, who canst guess so truly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\r\ndropping the mantle from his face, \xe2\x80\x9cart no true daughter of Israel, but\r\nin all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of Endor. I am not an\r\noutlaw, then, fair rose of Sharon. And I am one who will be more prompt\r\nto hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well\r\nbecome them, than to deprive thee of these ornaments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat wouldst thou have of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cif not my wealth?\xe2\x80\x94We can\r\nhave nought in common between us\xe2\x80\x94you are a Christian\xe2\x80\x94I am a Jewess.\xe2\x80\x94Our\r\nunion were contrary to the laws, alike of the church and the\r\nsynagogue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were so, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cwed with a\r\nJewess? \xe2\x80\x98Despardieux!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Not if she were the Queen of Sheba! And know,\r\nbesides, sweet daughter of Zion, that were the most Christian king to\r\noffer me his most Christian daughter, with Languedoc for a dowery, I\r\ncould not wed her. It is against my vow to love any maiden, otherwise\r\nthan \xe2\x80\x98par amours\xe2\x80\x99, as I will love thee. I am a Templar. Behold the\r\ncross of my Holy Order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarest thou appeal to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9con an occasion like the\r\npresent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cit concerns not thee, who art no\r\nbeliever in the blessed sign of our salvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe as my fathers taught,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cand may God forgive my\r\nbelief if erroneous! But you, Sir Knight, what is yours, when you\r\nappeal without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you\r\nare about to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and\r\nas a man of religion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is gravely and well preached, O daughter of Sirach!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nTemplar; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, gentle Ecclesiastics, thy narrow Jewish prejudices make\r\nthee blind to our high privilege. Marriage were an enduring crime on\r\nthe part of a Templar; but what lesser folly I may practise, I shall\r\nspeedily be absolved from at the next Preceptory of our Order. Not the\r\nwisest of monarchs, not his father, whose examples you must needs allow\r\nare weighty, claimed wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the\r\nTemple of Zion have won by our zeal in its defence. The protectors of\r\nSolomon\xe2\x80\x99s Temple may claim license by the example of Solomon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou readest the Scripture,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess, \xe2\x80\x9cand the lives of the\r\nsaints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy crime is\r\nlike that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and\r\nnecessary herbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Templar flashed fire at this reproof\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHearken,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cRebecca; I have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but now my\r\nlanguage shall be that of a conqueror. Thou art the captive of my bow\r\nand spear\xe2\x80\x94subject to my will by the laws of all nations; nor will I\r\nabate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou\r\nrefusest to entreaty or necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cstand back, and hear me ere thou offerest\r\nto commit a sin so deadly! My strength thou mayst indeed overpower for\r\nGod made women weak, and trusted their defence to man\xe2\x80\x99s generosity. But\r\nI will proclaim thy villainy, Templar, from one end of Europe to the\r\nother. I will owe to the superstition of thy brethren what their\r\ncompassion might refuse me, Each Preceptory\xe2\x80\x94each Chapter of thy Order,\r\nshall learn, that, like a heretic, thou hast sinned with a Jewess.\r\nThose who tremble not at thy crime, will hold thee accursed for having\r\nso far dishonoured the cross thou wearest, as to follow a daughter of\r\nmy people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art keen-witted, Jewess,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar, well aware of the\r\ntruth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his Order condemned in\r\nthe most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as\r\nhe now prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had\r\nfollowed upon it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthou art sharp-witted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut loud must be\r\nthy voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this\r\ncastle; within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams\r\nfor help, die alike silent away. One thing only can save thee, Rebecca.\r\nSubmit to thy fate\xe2\x80\x94embrace our religion, and thou shalt go forth in\r\nsuch state, that many a Norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in\r\nbeauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the\r\nTemple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSubmit to my fate!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand, sacred Heaven! to what\r\nfate?\xe2\x80\x94embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be that harbours\r\nsuch a villain?\xe2\x80\x94THOU the best lance of the Templars!\xe2\x80\x94Craven\r\nknight!\xe2\x80\x94forsworn priest! I spit at thee, and I defy thee.\xe2\x80\x94The God of\r\nAbraham\xe2\x80\x99s promise hath opened an escape to his daughter\xe2\x80\x94even from this\r\nabyss of infamy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she threw open the latticed window which led to the\r\nbartisan, and in an instant after, stood on the very verge of the\r\nparapet, with not the slightest screen between her and the tremendous\r\ndepth below. Unprepared for such a desperate effort, for she had\r\nhitherto stood perfectly motionless, Bois-Guilbert had neither time to\r\nintercept nor to stop her. As he offered to advance, she exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemain where thou art, proud Templar, or at thy choice advance!\xe2\x80\x94one\r\nfoot nearer, and I plunge myself from the precipice; my body shall be\r\ncrushed out of the very form of humanity upon the stones of that\r\ncourt-yard, ere it become the victim of thy brutality!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards\r\nheaven, as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final\r\nplunge. The Templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded\r\nto pity or distress, gave way to his admiration of her fortitude. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9crash girl!\xe2\x80\x94I swear by earth, and sea, and sky, I will\r\noffer thee no offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not trust thee, Templar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast taught me\r\nbetter how to estimate the virtues of thine Order. The next Preceptory\r\nwould grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned\r\nnought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable Jewish maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do me injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Templar fervently; \xe2\x80\x9cI swear to you\r\nby the name which I bear\xe2\x80\x94by the cross on my bosom\xe2\x80\x94by the sword on my\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94by the ancient crest of my fathers do I swear, I will do thee no\r\ninjury whatsoever! If not for thyself, yet for thy father\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\nforbear! I will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a\r\npowerful one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it but too well\xe2\x80\x94dare I trust thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou shalt have reason to complain of me! Many a\r\nlaw, many a commandment have I broken, but my word never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will then trust thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthus far;\xe2\x80\x9d and she descended\r\nfrom the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by one of\r\nthe embrasures, or \xe2\x80\x9cmachicolles\xe2\x80\x9d, as they were then called.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI take my stand. Remain where thou art, and if thou shalt\r\nattempt to diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt\r\nsee that the Jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with God, than\r\nher honour to the Templar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded\r\nso well with the expressive beauty of her countenance, gave to her\r\nlooks, air, and manner, a dignity that seemed more than mortal. Her\r\nglance quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so\r\ninstant and so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her\r\nfate at her command, and could escape at will from infamy to death,\r\ngave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet more\r\nbrilliant fire to her eye. Bois-Guilbert, proud himself and\r\nhigh-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so\r\ncommanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet there be peace between us, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, if thou wilt,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPeace\xe2\x80\x94but with this space\r\nbetween.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou needst no longer fear me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear thee not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she; \xe2\x80\x9cthanks to him that reared this dizzy\r\ntower so high, that nought could fall from it and live\xe2\x80\x94thanks to him,\r\nand to the God of Israel!\xe2\x80\x94I fear thee not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost me injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cby earth, sea, and sky,\r\nthou dost me injustice! I am not naturally that which you have seen me,\r\nhard, selfish, and relentless. It was woman that taught me cruelty, and\r\non woman therefore I have exercised it; but not upon such as thou. Hear\r\nme, Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94Never did knight take lance in his hand with a heart more\r\ndevoted to the lady of his love than Brian de Bois-Guilbert. She, the\r\ndaughter of a petty baron, who boasted for all his domains but a\r\nruinous tower, and an unproductive vineyard, and some few leagues of\r\nthe barren Landes of Bourdeaux, her name was known wherever deeds of\r\narms were done, known wider than that of many a lady\xe2\x80\x99s that had a\r\ncounty for a dowery.\xe2\x80\x94Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, pacing up and down the little\r\nplatform, with an animation in which he seemed to lose all\r\nconsciousness of Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s presence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my deeds, my danger, my\r\nblood, made the name of Adelaide de Montemare known from the court of\r\nCastile to that of Byzantium. And how was I requited?\xe2\x80\x94When I returned\r\nwith my dear-bought honours, purchased by toil and blood, I found her\r\nwedded to a Gascon squire, whose name was never heard beyond the limits\r\nof his own paltry domain! Truly did I love her, and bitterly did I\r\nrevenge me of her broken faith! But my vengeance has recoiled on\r\nmyself. Since that day I have separated myself from life and its\r\nties\xe2\x80\x94My manhood must know no domestic home\xe2\x80\x94must be soothed by no\r\naffectionate wife\xe2\x80\x94My age must know no kindly hearth\xe2\x80\x94My grave must be\r\nsolitary, and no offspring must outlive me, to bear the ancient name of\r\nBois-Guilbert. At the feet of my Superior I have laid down the right of\r\nself-action\xe2\x80\x94the privilege of independence. The Templar, a serf in all\r\nbut the name, can possess neither lands nor goods, and lives, moves,\r\nand breathes, but at the will and pleasure of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat advantages could compensate for such an\r\nabsolute sacrifice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe power of vengeance, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nprospects of ambition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn evil recompense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the surrender of the rights\r\nwhich are dearest to humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay not so, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9crevenge is a feast for the\r\ngods! And if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to themselves,\r\nit is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possession\r\nof mere mortals.\xe2\x80\x94And ambition? it is a temptation which could disturb\r\neven the bliss of heaven itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94He paused a moment, and then added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca! she who could prefer death to dishonour, must have a proud\r\nand a powerful soul. Mine thou must be!\xe2\x80\x94Nay, start not,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nmust be with thine own consent, and on thine own terms. Thou must\r\nconsent to share with me hopes more extended than can be viewed from\r\nthe throne of a monarch!\xe2\x80\x94Hear me ere you answer and judge ere you\r\nrefuse.\xe2\x80\x94The Templar loses, as thou hast said, his social rights, his\r\npower of free agency, but he becomes a member and a limb of a mighty\r\nbody, before which thrones already tremble,\xe2\x80\x94even as the single drop of\r\nrain which mixes with the sea becomes an individual part of that\r\nresistless ocean, which undermines rocks and ingulfs royal armadas.\r\nSuch a swelling flood is that powerful league. Of this mighty Order I\r\nam no mean member, but already one of the Chief Commanders, and may\r\nwell aspire one day to hold the batoon of Grand Master. The poor\r\nsoldiers of the Temple will not alone place their foot upon the necks\r\nof kings\xe2\x80\x94a hemp-sandall\xe2\x80\x99d monk can do that. Our mailed step shall\r\nascend their throne\xe2\x80\x94our gauntlet shall wrench the sceptre from their\r\ngripe. Not the reign of your vainly-expected Messiah offers such power\r\nto your dispersed tribes as my ambition may aim at. I have sought but a\r\nkindred spirit to share it, and I have found such in thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSayest thou this to one of my people?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca. \xe2\x80\x9cBethink\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cby urging the difference of our\r\ncreeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in\r\nderision. Think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of\r\nour founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of\r\ndying martyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by the\r\nswords of savages, while they vainly strove to defend a barren desert,\r\nvaluable only in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon adopted\r\nbolder and wider views, and found out a better indemnification for our\r\nsacrifices. Our immense possessions in every kingdom of Europe, our\r\nhigh military fame, which brings within our circle the flower of\r\nchivalry from every Christian clime\xe2\x80\x94these are dedicated to ends of\r\nwhich our pious founders little dreamed, and which are equally\r\nconcealed from such weak spirits as embrace our Order on the ancient\r\nprinciples, and whose superstition makes them our passive tools. But I\r\nwill not further withdraw the veil of our mysteries. That bugle-sound\r\nannounces something which may require my presence. Think on what I have\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x94Farewell!\xe2\x80\x94I do not say forgive me the violence I have threatened,\r\nfor it was necessary to the display of thy character. Gold can be only\r\nknown by the application of the touchstone. I will soon return, and\r\nhold further conference with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving\r\nRebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which\r\nshe had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the\r\nbold bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. When\r\nshe entered the turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to\r\nthe God of Jacob for the protection which he had afforded her, and to\r\nimplore its continuance for her and for her father. Another name glided\r\ninto her petition\xe2\x80\x94it was that of the wounded Christian, whom fate had\r\nplaced in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. Her heart\r\nindeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the Deity in prayer,\r\nshe mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate\r\nhers could have no alliance\xe2\x80\x94a Nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. But\r\nthe petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices\r\nof her sect induce Rebecca to wish it recalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nA damn\xe2\x80\x99d cramp piece of penmanship as ever I saw in my life!\r\n\r\n\r\nSHE STOOPS TO CONQUER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Templar reached the hall of the castle, he found De Bracy\r\nalready there. \xe2\x80\x9cYour love-suit,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9chath, I suppose, been\r\ndisturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. But you have come\r\nlater and more reluctantly, and therefore I presume your interview has\r\nproved more agreeable than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the Saxon heiress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Templar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the bones of Thomas a Becket,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lady Rowena\r\nmust have heard that I cannot endure the sight of women\xe2\x80\x99s tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cthou a leader of a Free Company, and regard\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s tears! A few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the\r\nflame blaze the brighter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthis damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. Never was\r\nsuch wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of\r\nSt Niobe, of whom Prior Aymer told us. 30 A water-fiend hath possessed\r\nthe fair Saxon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the Jewess,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nTemplar; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, I think no single one, not even Apollyon himself, could\r\nhave inspired such indomitable pride and resolution.\xe2\x80\x94But where is\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf? That horn is sounded more and more clamorously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is negotiating with the Jew, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy, coolly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprobably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle. Thou\r\nmayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his\r\ntreasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf is like to offer,\r\nwill raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and\r\ntrumpets to boot. But we will make the vassals call him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were soon after joined by Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, who had been disturbed in\r\nhis tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted,\r\nand had only tarried to give some necessary directions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see the cause of this cursed clamour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chere\r\nis a letter, and, if I mistake not, it is in Saxon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really\r\nsome hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the\r\npaper, and then handed it to De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be magic spells for aught I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, who possessed\r\nhis full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry\r\nof the period. \xe2\x80\x9cOur chaplain attempted to teach me to write,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut all my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades, and\r\nso the old shaveling gave up the task.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have that of the priestly\r\ncharacter, that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat says the scroll?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a formal letter of defiance,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, by our\r\nLady of Bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most\r\nextraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a\r\nbaronial castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJest!\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cI would gladly know who dares jest with me\r\nin such a matter!\xe2\x80\x94Read it, Sir Brian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Templar accordingly read it as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI, Wamba, the son of\r\nWitless, Jester to a noble and free-born man, Cedric of Rotherwood,\r\ncalled the Saxon,\xe2\x80\x94And I, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, the swineherd\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, interrupting the reader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St Luke, it is so set down,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar. Then resuming\r\nhis task, he went on,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI, Gurth, the son of Beowulph, swineherd unto\r\nthe said Cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates,\r\nwho make common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good\r\nknight, called for the present \xe2\x80\x98Le Noir Faineant\xe2\x80\x99, and the stout\r\nyeoman, Robert Locksley, called Cleave-the-Wand. Do you, Reginald Front\r\nde-B\xc5\x93uf, and your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that\r\nwhereas you have, without cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and\r\nby mastery seized upon the person of our lord and master the said\r\nCedric; also upon the person of a noble and freeborn damsel, the Lady\r\nRowena of Hargottstandstede; also upon the person of a noble and\r\nfreeborn man, Athelstane of Coningsburgh; also upon the persons of\r\ncertain freeborn men, their \xe2\x80\x98cnichts\xe2\x80\x99; also upon certain serfs, their\r\nborn bondsmen; also upon a certain Jew, named Isaac of York, together\r\nwith his daughter, a Jewess, and certain horses and mules: Which noble\r\npersons, with their \xe2\x80\x98cnichts\xe2\x80\x99 and slaves, and also with the horses and\r\nmules, Jew and Jewess beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty,\r\nand travelling as liege subjects upon the king\xe2\x80\x99s highway; therefore we\r\nrequire and demand that the said noble persons, namely, Cedric of\r\nRotherwood, Rowena of Hargottstandstede, Athelstane of Coningsburgh,\r\nwith their servants, \xe2\x80\x98cnichts\xe2\x80\x99, and followers, also the horses and\r\nmules, Jew and Jewess aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels\r\nto them pertaining, be, within an hour after the delivery hereof,\r\ndelivered to us, or to those whom we shall appoint to receive the same,\r\nand that untouched and unharmed in body and goods. Failing of which, we\r\ndo pronounce to you, that we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will\r\nwager our bodies against ye in battle, siege, or otherwise, and do our\r\nutmost to your annoyance and destruction. Wherefore may God have you in\r\nhis keeping.\xe2\x80\x94Signed by us upon the eve of St Withold\xe2\x80\x99s day, under the\r\ngreat trysting oak in the Hart-hill Walk, the above being written by a\r\nholy man, Clerk to God, our Lady, and St Dunstan, in the Chapel of\r\nCopmanhurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a rude\r\nsketch of a cock\xe2\x80\x99s head and comb, with a legend expressing this\r\nhieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of Wamba, son of Witless. Under this\r\nrespectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of Gurth, the\r\nson of Beowulph. Then was written, in rough bold characters, the words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Noir Faineant\xe2\x80\x9d. And, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough\r\ndrawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman Locksley.\r\n\r\nThe knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then\r\ngazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss\r\nto know what it could portend. De Bracy was the first to break silence\r\nby an uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though\r\nwith more moderation, by the Templar. Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, on the contrary,\r\nseemed impatient of their ill-timed jocularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you plain warning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfair sirs, that you had better\r\nconsult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way\r\nto such misplaced merriment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid De Bracy to the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9che is cowed at the very idea of a\r\ncartel, though it come but from a fool and a swineherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St Michael,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cI would thou couldst stand\r\nthe whole brunt of this adventure thyself, De Bracy. These fellows\r\ndared not have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not\r\nbeen supported by some strong bands. There are enough of outlaws in\r\nthis forest to resent my protecting the deer. I did but tie one fellow,\r\nwho was taken redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag,\r\nwhich gored him to death in five minutes, and I had as many arrows shot\r\nat me as there were launched against yonder target at Ashby.\xe2\x80\x94Here,\r\nfellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, to one of his attendants, \xe2\x80\x9chast thou sent out to see\r\nby what force this precious challenge is to be supported?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a\r\nsquire who was in attendance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a proper matter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthis comes of lending\r\nyou the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking quietly,\r\nbut you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf hornets?\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cof stingless drones rather; a band of\r\nlazy knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than\r\nlabour for their maintenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStingless!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cfork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard\r\nin length, and these shot within the breadth of a French crown, are\r\nsting enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Sir Knight!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us summon our people,\r\nand sally forth upon them. One knight\xe2\x80\x94ay, one man-at-arms, were enough\r\nfor twenty such peasants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, and too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI should only be ashamed to\r\ncouch lance against them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cwere they black Turks or Moors, Sir\r\nTemplar, or the craven peasants of France, most valiant De Bracy; but\r\nthese are English yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save\r\nwhat we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little\r\nin the glades of the forest. Sally, saidst thou? we have scarce men\r\nenough to defend the castle. The best of mine are at York; so is all\r\nyour band, De Bracy; and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful\r\nthat were engaged in this mad business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost not fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they can assemble in\r\nforce sufficient to attempt the castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, Sir Brian,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf. \xe2\x80\x9cThese outlaws have indeed\r\na daring captain; but without machines, scaling ladders, and\r\nexperienced leaders, my castle may defy them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend to thy neighbours,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9clet them assemble their\r\npeople, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester\r\nand a swineherd in the baronial castle of Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jest, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the baron; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to whom should I\r\nsend?\xe2\x80\x94Malvoisin is by this time at York with his retainers, and so are\r\nmy other allies; and so should I have been, but for this infernal\r\nenterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen send to York, and recall our people,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\r\nabide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my Free Companions, I\r\nwill give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in\r\ngreen-wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who shall bear such a message?\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cthey will\r\nbeset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom.\xe2\x80\x94I have it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, after pausing for a moment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSir Templar, thou canst write as\r\nwell as read, and if we can but find the writing materials of my\r\nchaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his Christmas\r\ncarousals\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo please ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the squire, who was still in attendance, \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nold Urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the confessor.\r\nHe was the last man, I have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her,\r\nwhich man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, search them out, Engelred,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cand then, Sir\r\nTemplar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather do it at the sword\xe2\x80\x99s point than at that of the pen,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bois-Guilbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut be it as you will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down accordingly, and indited, in the French language, an\r\nepistle of the following tenor:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSir Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, with his\r\nnoble and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the\r\nhands of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. If the person calling himself\r\nthe Black Knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he\r\nought to know that he stands degraded by his present association, and\r\nhas no right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood.\r\nTouching the prisoners we have made, we do in Christian charity require\r\nyou to send a man of religion, to receive their confession, and\r\nreconcile them with God; since it is our fixed intention to execute\r\nthem this morning before noon, so that their heads being placed on the\r\nbattlements, shall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have\r\nbestirred themselves in their rescue. Wherefore, as above, we require\r\nyou to send a priest to reconcile them to God, in doing which you shall\r\nrender them the last earthly service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to\r\nthe messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nThe yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the\r\nhead-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established\r\nunder a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the\r\ncastle. Here Wamba and Gurth, with their allies the Black Knight and\r\nLocksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to\r\ntheir summons. Around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a\r\nbold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed\r\nthe ordinary nature of their occupation. More than two hundred had\r\nalready assembled, and others were fast coming in. Those whom they\r\nobeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather\r\nin the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other\r\nrespects the same.\r\n\r\nBesides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting\r\nof the Saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as many\r\nbondsmen and servants from Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s extensive estate, had already\r\narrived, for the purpose of assisting in his rescue. Few of these were\r\narmed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes\r\nconverts to military purposes. Boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the\r\nlike, were their chief arms; for the Normans, with the usual policy of\r\nconquerors, were jealous of permitting to the vanquished Saxons the\r\npossession or the use of swords and spears. These circumstances\r\nrendered the assistance of the Saxons far from being so formidable to\r\nthe besieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their superior\r\nnumbers, and the animation inspired by a just cause, might otherwise\r\nwell have made them. It was to the leaders of this motley army that the\r\nletter of the Templar was now delivered.\r\n\r\nReference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the crook of St Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d said that worthy ecclesiastic, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich\r\nhath brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of e\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nanother saint in Paradise, I swear that I cannot expound unto you this\r\njargon, which, whether it be French or Arabic, is beyond my guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then gave the letter to Gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and\r\npassed it to Wamba. The Jester looked at each of the four corners of\r\nthe paper with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt\r\nto assume upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter\r\nto Locksley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, I\r\nmight know something of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the brave yeoman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as the\r\nmatter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that\xe2\x80\x99s at\r\ntwelve miles distance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must be clerk, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight; and taking the letter\r\nfrom Locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the\r\nmeaning in Saxon to his confederates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExecute the noble Cedric!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cby the rood, thou must be\r\nmistaken, Sir Knight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I, my worthy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI have explained the\r\nwords as they are here set down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, by St Thomas of Canterbury,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gurth, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will have the\r\ncastle, should we tear it down with our hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have nothing else to tear it with,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cbut mine are\r\nscarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis but a contrivance to gain time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cthey dare not do\r\na deed for which I could exact a fearful penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthere were some one among us who\r\ncould obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case\r\nstands with the besieged. Methinks, as they require a confessor to be\r\nsent, this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and\r\nprocure us the information we desire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA plague on thee, and thy advice!\xe2\x80\x9d said the pious hermit; \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\r\nthee, Sir Slothful Knight, that when I doff my friar\xe2\x80\x99s frock, my\r\npriesthood, my sanctity, my very Latin, are put off along with it; and\r\nwhen in my green jerkin, I can better kill twenty deer than confess one\r\nChristian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear greatly, there is no one here\r\nthat is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character\r\nof father confessor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll looked on each other, and were silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, after a short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the fool must be still\r\nthe fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from.\r\nYou must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that I wore russet\r\nbefore I wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever\r\ncame upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. I trust, with\r\nthe assistance of the good hermit\xe2\x80\x99s frock, together with the\r\npriesthood, sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of\r\nit, I shall be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly\r\ncomfort to our worthy master Cedric, and his companions in adversity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHath he sense enough, thinkst thou?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, addressing\r\nGurth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gurth; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if he hath not, it will be the first\r\ntime he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn with the frock, then, good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cand let thy\r\nmaster send us an account of their situation within the castle. Their\r\nnumbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a\r\nsudden and bold attack. Time wears\xe2\x80\x94away with thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, in the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will beset the place so\r\nclosely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. So\r\nthat, my good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cthou mayst\r\nassure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the\r\npersons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPax vobiscum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, who was now muffled in his religious\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar,\r\nand departed to execute his mission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hottest horse will oft be cool,\r\nThe dullest will show fire;\r\nThe friar will often play the fool,\r\nThe fool will play the friar.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and\r\nhaving his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the\r\nportal of the castle of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, the warder demanded of him his\r\nname and errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPax vobiscum,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a poor brother of the Order\r\nof St Francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy\r\nprisoners now secured within this castle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a bold friar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the warder, \xe2\x80\x9cto come hither, where,\r\nsaving our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed\r\nthese twenty years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe pretended friar; \xe2\x80\x9ctrust me it will find good acceptance with him,\r\nand the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the warder; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if I come to shame for leaving my\r\npost upon thine errand, I will try whether a friar\xe2\x80\x99s grey gown be proof\r\nagainst a grey-goose shaft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the\r\ncastle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the\r\ngate and demanded instant admission. With no small wonder he received\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having\r\npreviously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed,\r\nwithout further scruple, the commands which he had received. The\r\nharebrained self-conceit which had emboldened Wamba to undertake this\r\ndangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found\r\nhimself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as\r\nReginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, and he brought out his \xe2\x80\x9cpax vobiscum\xe2\x80\x9d, to which\r\nhe, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with more\r\nanxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. But\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his\r\npresence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him\r\nany cause of suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho and whence art thou, priest?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a poor servant of St\r\nFrancis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallen among\r\nthieves, (as Scripture hath it,) \xe2\x80\x98quidam viator incidit in latrones\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nwhich thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly\r\noffice on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cand canst thou tell me, holy\r\nfather, the number of those banditti?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGallant sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98nomen illis legio\xe2\x80\x99, their name is\r\nlegion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak\r\nand cord will ill protect thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the supposed friar, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98cor meum eructavit\xe2\x80\x99, that is to say,\r\nI was like to burst with fear! but I conceive they may be\xe2\x80\x94what of\r\nyeomen\xe2\x80\x94what of commons, at least five hundred men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, who came into the hall that moment, \xe2\x80\x9cmuster\r\nthe wasps so thick here? it is time to stifle such a mischievous\r\nbrood.\xe2\x80\x9d Then taking Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf aside \xe2\x80\x9cKnowest thou the priest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a stranger from a distant convent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cI know\r\nhim not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen trust him not with thy purpose in words,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him carry a written order to De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s company of Free\r\nCompanions, to repair instantly to their master\xe2\x80\x99s aid. In the meantime,\r\nand that the shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely\r\nabout his task of preparing these Saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf. And he forthwith appointed a\r\ndomestic to conduct Wamba to the apartment where Cedric and Athelstane\r\nwere confined.\r\n\r\nThe impatience of Cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by\r\nhis confinement. He walked from one end of the hall to the other, with\r\nthe attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the\r\nbreach of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself,\r\nsometimes addressing Athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the\r\nissue of the adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great\r\ncomposure, the liberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly\r\ninteresting himself about the duration of his captivity, which he\r\nconcluded, would, like all earthly evils, find an end in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, entering the apartment; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nblessing of St Dunstan, St Dennis, St Duthoc, and all other saints\r\nwhatsoever, be upon ye and about ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnter freely,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric to the supposed friar; \xe2\x80\x9cwith what\r\nintent art thou come hither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo bid you prepare yourselves for death,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric, starting. \xe2\x80\x9cFearless and wicked as\r\nthey are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cto restrain them by their sense of humanity,\r\nis the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.\r\nBethink thee, therefore, noble Cedric, and you also, gallant\r\nAthelstane, what crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very\r\nday will ye be called to answer at a higher tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearest thou this, Athelstane?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must rouse up our\r\nhearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men,\r\nthan live like slaves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cto stand the worst of their malice,\r\nand shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever I did to my\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us then unto our holy gear, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait yet a moment, good uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, in his natural tone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbetter look long before you leap in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cI should know that voice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that of your trusty slave and jester,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba, throwing\r\nback his cowl. \xe2\x80\x9cHad you taken a fool\xe2\x80\x99s advice formerly, you would not\r\nhave been here at all. Take a fool\xe2\x80\x99s advice now, and you will not be\r\nhere long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow mean\xe2\x80\x99st thou, knave?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Saxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven thus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9ctake thou this frock and cord, which are\r\nall the orders I ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving\r\nme your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave thee in my stead!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, astonished at the proposal;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhy, they would hang thee, my poor knave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x99en let them do as they are permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cI trust\xe2\x80\x94no\r\ndisparagement to your birth\xe2\x80\x94that the son of Witless may hang in a chain\r\nwith as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cfor one thing will I grant thy\r\nrequest. And that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with\r\nLord Athelstane instead of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, by St Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cthere were little reason in that.\r\nGood right there is, that the son of Witless should suffer to save the\r\nson of Hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the\r\nbenefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVillain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fathers of Athelstane were monarchs of\r\nEngland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might be whomsoever they pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cbut my neck\r\nstands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their\r\nsake. Wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or\r\nsuffer me to leave this dungeon as free as I entered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the old tree wither,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cso the stately hope of\r\nthe forest be preserved. Save the noble Athelstane, my trusty Wamba! it\r\nis the duty of each who has Saxon blood in his veins. Thou and I will\r\nabide together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he,\r\nfree and safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to\r\navenge us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, father Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, grasping his hand,\xe2\x80\x94for, when\r\nroused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming\r\nhis high race\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather remain in this\r\nhall a week without food save the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s stinted loaf, or drink\r\nsave the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to\r\nescape which the slave\xe2\x80\x99s untaught kindness has purveyed for his\r\nmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are called wise men, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cand I a crazed fool;\r\nbut, uncle Cedric, and cousin Athelstane, the fool shall decide this\r\ncontroversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any\r\nfarther. I am like John-a-Duck\xe2\x80\x99s mare, that will let no man mount her\r\nbut John-a-Duck. I came to save my master, and if he will not\r\nconsent\xe2\x80\x94basta\xe2\x80\x94I can but go away home again. Kind service cannot be\r\nchucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hang\r\nfor no man but my own born master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, then, noble Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cneglect not this\r\nopportunity. Your presence without may encourage friends to our\r\nrescue\xe2\x80\x94your remaining here would ruin us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric,\r\nlooking to the Jester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProspect, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9clet me tell you, when you fill my\r\ncloak, you are wrapped in a general\xe2\x80\x99s cassock. Five hundred men are\r\nthere without, and I was this morning one of the chief leaders. My\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x99s cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. Well, we shall see\r\nwhat good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. Truly, I\r\nfear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. And so\r\nfarewell, master, and be kind to poor Gurth and his dog Fangs; and let\r\nmy cockscomb hang in the hall at Rotherwood, in memory that I flung\r\naway my life for my master, like a faithful\xe2\x80\x94-fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest\r\nand earnest. The tears stood in Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy memory shall be preserved,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile fidelity and affection\r\nhave honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find the means of\r\nsaving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and thee, also, my poor Wamba,\r\nthou shouldst not overbear me in this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck\r\nCedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no language,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut my own, and a few words of their\r\nmincing Norman. How shall I bear myself like a reverend brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spell lies in two words,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wamba\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99 will\r\nanswer all queries. If you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, \xe2\x80\x98Pax\r\nvobiscum\xe2\x80\x99 carries you through it all. It is as useful to a friar as a\r\nbroomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. Speak it but thus, in a\r\ndeep grave tone,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it is irresistible\xe2\x80\x94Watch and ward,\r\nknight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all. I\r\nthink, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to be\r\ndoubted they may, I will try its weight upon the finisher of the\r\nsentence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf such prove the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master, \xe2\x80\x9cmy religious orders are\r\nsoon taken\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99. I trust I shall remember the\r\npass-word.\xe2\x80\x94Noble Athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose\r\nheart might make amends for a weaker head\xe2\x80\x94I will save you, or return\r\nand die with you. The royal blood of our Saxon kings shall not be spilt\r\nwhile mine beats in my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of\r\nthe kind knave who risked himself for his master, if Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s peril can\r\nprevent it.\xe2\x80\x94Farewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, noble Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cremember it is the true\r\npart of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d added Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cand remember \xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus exhorted, Cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not\r\nlong ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his\r\nJester had recommended as omnipotent. In a low-arched and dusky\r\npassage, by which he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the\r\ncastle, he was interrupted by a female form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to hurry\r\npast, when a soft voice replied, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Et vobis\xe2\x80\x94quaso, domine\r\nreverendissime, pro misericordia vestra\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am somewhat deaf,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric, in good Saxon, and at the same\r\ntime muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cA curse on the fool and his \xe2\x80\x98Pax vobiscum!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI have lost my javelin at the first cast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, however, no unusual thing for a priest of those days to be deaf\r\nof his Latin ear, and this the person who now addressed Cedric knew\r\nfull well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray you of dear love, reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in his own\r\nlanguage, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will deign to visit with your ghostly comfort a\r\nwounded prisoner of this castle, and have such compassion upon him and\r\nus as thy holy office teaches\xe2\x80\x94Never shall good deed so highly advantage\r\nthy convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, much embarrassed, \xe2\x80\x9cmy time in this castle\r\nwill not permit me to exercise the duties of mine office\xe2\x80\x94I must\r\npresently forth\xe2\x80\x94there is life and death upon my speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, father, let me entreat you by the vow you have taken on you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the suppliant, \xe2\x80\x9cnot to leave the oppressed and endangered\r\nwithout counsel or succour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the fiend fly away with me, and leave me in Ifrin with the souls\r\nof Odin and of Thor!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric impatiently, and would probably\r\nhave proceeded in the same tone of total departure from his spiritual\r\ncharacter, when the colloquy was interrupted by the harsh voice of\r\nUrfried, the old crone of the turret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, minion,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to the female speaker, \xe2\x80\x9cis this the manner in\r\nwhich you requite the kindness which permitted thee to leave thy\r\nprison-cell yonder?\xe2\x80\x94Puttest thou the reverend man to use ungracious\r\nlanguage to free himself from the importunities of a Jewess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Jewess!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, availing himself of the information to get\r\nclear of their interruption,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass, woman! stop me not at your\r\nperil. I am fresh from my holy office, and would avoid pollution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome this way, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old hag, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art a stranger in this\r\ncastle, and canst not leave it without a guide. Come hither, for I\r\nwould speak with thee.\xe2\x80\x94And you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the\r\nsick man\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you if\r\nyou again quit it without my permission!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRebecca retreated. Her importunities had prevailed upon Urfried to\r\nsuffer her to quit the turret, and Urfried had employed her services\r\nwhere she herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of\r\nthe wounded Ivanhoe. With an understanding awake to their dangerous\r\nsituation, and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which\r\noccurred, Rebecca had hoped something from the presence of a man of\r\nreligion, who, she learned from Urfried, had penetrated into this\r\ngodless castle. She watched the return of the supposed ecclesiastic,\r\nwith the purpose of addressing him, and interesting him in favour of\r\nthe prisoners; with what imperfect success the reader has been just\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFond wretch! and what canst thou relate,\r\nBut deeds of sorrow, shame, and sin?\r\nThy deeds are proved\xe2\x80\x94thou know\xe2\x80\x99st thy fate;\r\nBut come, thy tale\xe2\x80\x94begin\xe2\x80\x94begin.\r\n\r\nBut I have griefs of other kind,\r\nTroubles and sorrows more severe;\r\nGive me to ease my tortured mind,\r\nLend to my woes a patient ear;\r\nAnd let me, if I may not find\r\nA friend to help\xe2\x80\x94find one to hear.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRABBE\xe2\x80\x99S HALL OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Urfried had with clamours and menaces driven Rebecca back to the\r\napartment from which she had sallied, she proceeded to conduct the\r\nunwilling Cedric into a small apartment, the door of which she\r\nheedfully secured. Then fetching from a cupboard a stoup of wine and\r\ntwo flagons, she placed them on the table, and said in a tone rather\r\nasserting a fact than asking a question, \xe2\x80\x9cThou art Saxon, father\xe2\x80\x94Deny\r\nit not,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, observing that Cedric hastened not to reply;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe sounds of my native language are sweet to mine ears, though seldom\r\nheard save from the tongues of the wretched and degraded serfs on whom\r\nthe proud Normans impose the meanest drudgery of this dwelling. Thou\r\nart a Saxon, father\xe2\x80\x94a Saxon, and, save as thou art a servant of God, a\r\nfreeman.\xe2\x80\x94Thine accents are sweet in mine ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not Saxon priests visit this castle, then?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\nwere, methinks, their duty to comfort the outcast and oppressed\r\nchildren of the soil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey come not\xe2\x80\x94or if they come, they better love to revel at the boards\r\nof their conquerors,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Urfried, \xe2\x80\x9cthan to hear the groans of\r\ntheir countrymen\xe2\x80\x94so, at least, report speaks of them\xe2\x80\x94of myself I can\r\nsay little. This castle, for ten years, has opened to no priest save\r\nthe debauched Norman chaplain who partook the nightly revels of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, and he has been long gone to render an account of his\r\nstewardship.\xe2\x80\x94But thou art a Saxon\xe2\x80\x94a Saxon priest, and I have one\r\nquestion to ask of thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a Saxon,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cbut unworthy, surely, of the name of\r\npriest. Let me begone on my way\xe2\x80\x94I swear I will return, or send one of\r\nour fathers more worthy to hear your confession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay yet a while,\xe2\x80\x9d said Urfried; \xe2\x80\x9cthe accents of the voice which thou\r\nhearest now will soon be choked with the cold earth, and I would not\r\ndescend to it like the beast I have lived. But wine must give me\r\nstrength to tell the horrors of my tale.\xe2\x80\x9d She poured out a cup, and\r\ndrank it with a frightful avidity, which seemed desirous of draining\r\nthe last drop in the goblet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt stupifies,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking upwards\r\nas she finished her drought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it cannot cheer\xe2\x80\x94Partake it, father,\r\nif you would hear my tale without sinking down upon the pavement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCedric would have avoided pledging her in this ominous conviviality,\r\nbut the sign which she made to him expressed impatience and despair. He\r\ncomplied with her request, and answered her challenge in a large\r\nwine-cup; she then proceeded with her story, as if appeased by his\r\ncomplaisance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not born,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfather, the wretch that thou now seest me.\r\nI was free, was happy, was honoured, loved, and was beloved. I am now a\r\nslave, miserable and degraded\xe2\x80\x94the sport of my masters\xe2\x80\x99 passions while I\r\nhad yet beauty\xe2\x80\x94the object of their contempt, scorn, and hatred, since\r\nit has passed away. Dost thou wonder, father, that I should hate\r\nmankind, and, above all, the race that has wrought this change in me?\r\nCan the wrinkled decrepit hag before thee, whose wrath must vent itself\r\nin impotent curses, forget she was once the daughter of the noble Thane\r\nof Torquilstone, before whose frown a thousand vassals trembled?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou the daughter of Torquil Wolfganger!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, receding as he\r\nspoke; \xe2\x80\x9cthou\xe2\x80\x94thou\xe2\x80\x94the daughter of that noble Saxon, my father\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nand companion in arms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy father\xe2\x80\x99s friend!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Urfried; \xe2\x80\x9cthen Cedric called the Saxon\r\nstands before me, for the noble Hereward of Rotherwood had but one son,\r\nwhose name is well known among his countrymen. But if thou art Cedric\r\nof Rotherwood, why this religious dress?\xe2\x80\x94hast thou too despaired of\r\nsaving thy country, and sought refuge from oppression in the shade of\r\nthe convent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters not who I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cproceed, unhappy woman, with\r\nthy tale of horror and guilt!\xe2\x80\x94Guilt there must be\xe2\x80\x94there is guilt even\r\nin thy living to tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is\xe2\x80\x94there is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the wretched woman, \xe2\x80\x9cdeep, black, damning\r\nguilt,\xe2\x80\x94guilt, that lies like a load at my breast\xe2\x80\x94guilt, that all the\r\npenitential fires of hereafter cannot cleanse.\xe2\x80\x94Yes, in these halls,\r\nstained with the noble and pure blood of my father and my brethren\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthese very halls, to have lived the paramour of their murderer, the\r\nslave at once and the partaker of his pleasures, was to render every\r\nbreath which I drew of vital air, a crime and a curse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretched woman!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cedric. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd while the friends of thy\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94while each true Saxon heart, as it breathed a requiem for his\r\nsoul, and those of his valiant sons, forgot not in their prayers the\r\nmurdered Ulrica\xe2\x80\x94while all mourned and honoured the dead, thou hast\r\nlived to merit our hate and execration\xe2\x80\x94lived to unite thyself with the\r\nvile tyrant who murdered thy nearest and dearest\xe2\x80\x94who shed the blood of\r\ninfancy, rather than a male of the noble house of Torquil Wolfganger\r\nshould survive\xe2\x80\x94with him hast thou lived to unite thyself, and in the\r\nhands of lawless love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn lawless hands, indeed, but not in those of love!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hag;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clove will sooner visit the regions of eternal doom, than those\r\nunhallowed vaults.\xe2\x80\x94No, with that at least I cannot reproach\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94hatred to Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and his race governed my soul most\r\ndeeply, even in the hour of his guilty endearments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hated him, and yet you lived,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cwretch! was there\r\nno poniard\xe2\x80\x94no knife\xe2\x80\x94no bodkin!\xe2\x80\x94Well was it for thee, since thou didst\r\nprize such an existence, that the secrets of a Norman castle are like\r\nthose of the grave. For had I but dreamed of the daughter of Torquil\r\nliving in foul communion with the murderer of her father, the sword of\r\na true Saxon had found thee out even in the arms of thy paramour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldst thou indeed have done this justice to the name of Torquil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ulrica, for we may now lay aside her assumed name of Urfried;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthou art then the true Saxon report speaks thee! for even within these\r\naccursed walls, where, as thou well sayest, guilt shrouds itself in\r\ninscrutable mystery, even there has the name of Cedric been sounded\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI, wretched and degraded, have rejoiced to think that there yet\r\nbreathed an avenger of our unhappy nation.\xe2\x80\x94I also have had my hours of\r\nvengeance\xe2\x80\x94I have fomented the quarrels of our foes, and heated drunken\r\nrevelry into murderous broil\xe2\x80\x94I have seen their blood flow\xe2\x80\x94I have heard\r\ntheir dying groans!\xe2\x80\x94Look on me, Cedric\xe2\x80\x94are there not still left on this\r\nfoul and faded face some traces of the features of Torquil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me not of them, Ulrica,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cedric, in a tone of grief mixed\r\nwith abhorrence; \xe2\x80\x9cthese traces form such a resemblance as arises from\r\nthe graves of the dead, when a fiend has animated the lifeless corpse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ulrica; \xe2\x80\x9cyet wore these fiendish features the mask\r\nof a spirit of light when they were able to set at variance the elder\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf and his son Reginald! The darkness of hell should hide\r\nwhat followed, but revenge must lift the veil, and darkly intimate what\r\nit would raise the dead to speak aloud. Long had the smouldering fire\r\nof discord glowed between the tyrant father and his savage son\xe2\x80\x94long had\r\nI nursed, in secret, the unnatural hatred\xe2\x80\x94it blazed forth in an hour of\r\ndrunken wassail, and at his own board fell my oppressor by the hand of\r\nhis own son\xe2\x80\x94such are the secrets these vaults conceal!\xe2\x80\x94Rend asunder, ye\r\naccursed arches,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, looking up towards the roof, \xe2\x80\x9cand bury in\r\nyour fall all who are conscious of the hideous mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou, creature of guilt and misery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat became thy\r\nlot on the death of thy ravisher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess it, but ask it not.\xe2\x80\x94Here\xe2\x80\x94here I dwelt, till age, premature age,\r\nhas stamped its ghastly features on my countenance\xe2\x80\x94scorned and insulted\r\nwhere I was once obeyed, and compelled to bound the revenge which had\r\nonce such ample scope, to the efforts of petty malice of a discontented\r\nmenial, or the vain or unheeded curses of an impotent hag\xe2\x80\x94condemned to\r\nhear from my lonely turret the sounds of revelry in which I once\r\npartook, or the shrieks and groans of new victims of oppression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlrica,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a heart which still, I fear, regrets the\r\nlost reward of thy crimes, as much as the deeds by which thou didst\r\nacquire that meed, how didst thou dare to address thee to one who wears\r\nthis robe? Consider, unhappy woman, what could the sainted Edward\r\nhimself do for thee, were he here in bodily presence? The royal\r\nConfessor was endowed by heaven with power to cleanse the ulcers of the\r\nbody, but only God himself can cure the leprosy of the soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, turn not from me, stern prophet of wrath,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\ntell me, if thou canst, in what shall terminate these new and awful\r\nfeelings that burst on my solitude\xe2\x80\x94Why do deeds, long since done, rise\r\nbefore me in new and irresistible horrors? What fate is prepared beyond\r\nthe grave for her, to whom God has assigned on earth a lot of such\r\nunspeakable wretchedness? Better had I turn to Woden, Hertha, and\r\nZernebock\xe2\x80\x94to Mista, and to Skogula, the gods of our yet unbaptized\r\nancestors, than endure the dreadful anticipations which have of late\r\nhaunted my waking and my sleeping hours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, turning with disgust from this miserable\r\npicture of guilt, wretchedness, and despair; \xe2\x80\x9cI am no priest, though I\r\nwear a priest\xe2\x80\x99s garment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPriest or layman,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ulrica, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art the first I have seen\r\nfor twenty years, by whom God was feared or man regarded; and dost thou\r\nbid me despair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bid thee repent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric. \xe2\x80\x9cSeek to prayer and penance, and\r\nmayest thou find acceptance! But I cannot, I will not, longer abide\r\nwith thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay yet a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ulrica; \xe2\x80\x9cleave me not now, son of my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend, lest the demon who has governed my life should tempt me to\r\navenge myself of thy hard-hearted scorn\xe2\x80\x94Thinkest thou, if Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\r\nfound Cedric the Saxon in his castle, in such a disguise, that thy life\r\nwould be a long one?\xe2\x80\x94Already his eye has been upon thee like a falcon\r\non his prey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd be it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cand let him tear me with beak and talons,\r\nere my tongue say one word which my heart doth not warrant. I will die\r\na Saxon\xe2\x80\x94true in word, open in deed\xe2\x80\x94I bid thee avaunt!\xe2\x80\x94touch me not,\r\nstay me not!\xe2\x80\x94The sight of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf himself is less odious to me\r\nthan thou, degraded and degenerate as thou art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ulrica, no longer interrupting him; \xe2\x80\x9cgo thy way, and\r\nforget, in the insolence of thy superority, that the wretch before thee\r\nis the daughter of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s friend.\xe2\x80\x94Go thy way\xe2\x80\x94if I am separated\r\nfrom mankind by my sufferings\xe2\x80\x94separated from those whose aid I might\r\nmost justly expect\xe2\x80\x94not less will I be separated from them in my\r\nrevenge!\xe2\x80\x94No man shall aid me, but the ears of all men shall tingle to\r\nhear of the deed which I shall dare to do!\xe2\x80\x94Farewell!\xe2\x80\x94thy scorn has\r\nburst the last tie which seemed yet to unite me to my kind\xe2\x80\x94a thought\r\nthat my woes might claim the compassion of my people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlrica,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, softened by this appeal, \xe2\x80\x9chast thou borne up and\r\nendured to live through so much guilt and so much misery, and wilt thou\r\nnow yield to despair when thine eyes are opened to thy crimes, and when\r\nrepentance were thy fitter occupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCedric,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ulrica, \xe2\x80\x9cthou little knowest the human heart. To act\r\nas I have acted, to think as I have thought, requires the maddening\r\nlove of pleasure, mingled with the keen appetite of revenge, the proud\r\nconsciousness of power; droughts too intoxicating for the human heart\r\nto bear, and yet retain the power to prevent. Their force has long\r\npassed away\xe2\x80\x94Age has no pleasures, wrinkles have no influence, revenge\r\nitself dies away in impotent curses. Then comes remorse, with all its\r\nvipers, mixed with vain regrets for the past, and despair for the\r\nfuture!\xe2\x80\x94Then, when all other strong impulses have ceased, we become\r\nlike the fiends in hell, who may feel remorse, but never\r\nrepentance.\xe2\x80\x94But thy words have awakened a new soul within me\xe2\x80\x94Well hast\r\nthou said, all is possible for those who dare to die!\xe2\x80\x94Thou hast shown\r\nme the means of revenge, and be assured I will embrace them. It has\r\nhitherto shared this wasted bosom with other and with rival\r\npassions\xe2\x80\x94henceforward it shall possess me wholly, and thou thyself\r\nshalt say, that, whatever was the life of Ulrica, her death well became\r\nthe daughter of the noble Torquil. There is a force without\r\nbeleaguering this accursed castle\xe2\x80\x94hasten to lead them to the attack,\r\nand when thou shalt see a red flag wave from the turret on the eastern\r\nangle of the donjon, press the Normans hard\xe2\x80\x94they will then have enough\r\nto do within, and you may win the wall in spite both of bow and\r\nmangonel.\xe2\x80\x94Begone, I pray thee\xe2\x80\x94follow thine own fate, and leave me to\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric would have enquired farther into the purpose which she thus\r\ndarkly announced, but the stern voice of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf was heard,\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere tarries this loitering priest? By the scallop-shell\r\nof Compostella, I will make a martyr of him, if he loiters here to\r\nhatch treason among my domestics!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a true prophet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ulrica, \xe2\x80\x9cis an evil conscience! But heed\r\nhim not\xe2\x80\x94out and to thy people\xe2\x80\x94Cry your Saxon onslaught, and let them\r\nsing their war-song of Rollo, if they will; vengeance shall bear a\r\nburden to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she thus spoke, she vanished through a private door, and Reginald\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf entered the apartment. Cedric, with some difficulty,\r\ncompelled himself to make obeisance to the haughty Baron, who returned\r\nhis courtesy with a slight inclination of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy penitents, father, have made a long shrift\xe2\x80\x94it is the better for\r\nthem, since it is the last they shall ever make. Hast thou prepared\r\nthem for death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, in such French as he could command,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cexpecting the worst, from the moment they knew into whose power they\r\nhad fallen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, Sir Friar,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthy speech, methinks,\r\nsmacks of a Saxon tongue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was bred in the convent of St Withold of Burton,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Baron; \xe2\x80\x9cit had been better for thee to have been a\r\nNorman, and better for my purpose too; but need has no choice of\r\nmessengers. That St Withold\xe2\x80\x99s of Burton is an owlet\xe2\x80\x99s nest worth the\r\nharrying. The day will soon come that the frock shall protect the Saxon\r\nas little as the mail-coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s will be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, in a voice tremulous with passion,\r\nwhich Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf imputed to fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthou dreamest already that our men-at-arms are in\r\nthy refectory and thy ale-vaults. But do me one cast of thy holy\r\noffice, and, come what list of others, thou shalt sleep as safe in thy\r\ncell as a snail within his shell of proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak your commands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, with suppressed emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me through this passage, then, that I may dismiss thee by the\r\npostern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as he strode on his way before the supposed friar, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\r\nthus schooled him in the part which he desired he should act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou seest, Sir Friar, yon herd of Saxon swine, who have dared to\r\nenviron this castle of Torquilstone\xe2\x80\x94Tell them whatever thou hast a mind\r\nof the weakness of this fortalice, or aught else that can detain them\r\nbefore it for twenty-four hours. Meantime bear thou this scroll\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nsoft\xe2\x80\x94canst read, Sir Priest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a jot I,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9csave on my breviary; and then I know\r\nthe characters, because I have the holy service by heart, praised be\r\nOur Lady and St Withold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fitter messenger for my purpose.\xe2\x80\x94Carry thou this scroll to the\r\ncastle of Philip de Malvoisin; say it cometh from me, and is written by\r\nthe Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and that I pray him to send it to\r\nYork with all the speed man and horse can make. Meanwhile, tell him to\r\ndoubt nothing, he shall find us whole and sound behind our\r\nbattlement\xe2\x80\x94Shame on it, that we should be compelled to hide thus by a\r\npack of runagates, who are wont to fly even at the flash of our pennons\r\nand the tramp of our horses! I say to thee, priest, contrive some cast\r\nof thine art to keep the knaves where they are, until our friends bring\r\nup their lances. My vengeance is awake, and she is a falcon that\r\nslumbers not till she has been gorged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my patron saint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, with deeper energy than became his\r\ncharacter, \xe2\x80\x9cand by every saint who has lived and died in England, your\r\ncommands shall be obeyed! Not a Saxon shall stir from before these\r\nwalls, if I have art and influence to detain them there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthou changest thy tone, Sir Priest, and\r\nspeakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the\r\nSaxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would at\r\nthis moment have been much the better of a hint from Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nfertile brain. But necessity, according to the ancient proverb,\r\nsharpens invention, and he muttered something under his cowl concerning\r\nthe men in question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Despardieux\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast spoken the very\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94I forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot, as well as if\r\nthey had been born south of yonder salt channel. Was it not he of St\r\nIves whom they tied to an oak-tree, and compelled to sing a mass while\r\nthey were rifling his mails and his wallets?\xe2\x80\x94No, by our Lady\xe2\x80\x94that jest\r\nwas played by Gualtier of Middleton, one of our own companions-at-arms.\r\nBut they were Saxons who robbed the chapel at St Bees of cup,\r\ncandlestick and chalice, were they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were godless men,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and they drank out all the good wine and ale that lay in store for\r\nmany a secret carousal, when ye pretend ye are but busied with vigils\r\nand primes!\xe2\x80\x94Priest, thou art bound to revenge such sacrilege.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am indeed bound to vengeance,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cSaint Withold knows\r\nmy heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, in the meanwhile, led the way to a postern, where,\r\npassing the moat on a single plank, they reached a small barbican, or\r\nexterior defence, which communicated with the open field by a\r\nwell-fortified sallyport.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegone, then; and if thou wilt do mine errand, and if thou return\r\nhither when it is done, thou shalt see Saxon flesh cheap as ever was\r\nhog\xe2\x80\x99s in the shambles of Sheffield. And, hark thee, thou seemest to be\r\na jolly confessor\xe2\x80\x94come hither after the onslaught, and thou shalt have\r\nas much Malvoisie as would drench thy whole convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly we shall meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething in hand the whilst,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Norman; and, as they\r\nparted at the postern door, he thrust into Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s reluctant hand a\r\ngold byzant, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, I will fly off both cowl and skin, if\r\nthou failest in thy purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd full leave will I give thee to do both,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, leaving\r\nthe postern, and striding forth over the free field with a joyful step,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif, when we meet next, I deserve not better at thine hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Turning\r\nthen back towards the castle, he threw the piece of gold towards the\r\ndonor, exclaiming at the same time, \xe2\x80\x9cFalse Norman, thy money perish\r\nwith thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf heard the words imperfectly, but the action was\r\nsuspicious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cArchers,\xe2\x80\x9d he called to the warders on the outward\r\nbattlements, \xe2\x80\x9csend me an arrow through yon monk\xe2\x80\x99s frock!\xe2\x80\x94yet stay,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, as his retainers were bending their bows, \xe2\x80\x9cit avails not\xe2\x80\x94we must\r\nthus far trust him since we have no better shift. I think he dares not\r\nbetray me\xe2\x80\x94at the worst I can but treat with these Saxon dogs whom I\r\nhave safe in kennel.\xe2\x80\x94Ho! Giles jailor, let them bring Cedric of\r\nRotherwood before me, and the other churl, his companion\xe2\x80\x94him I mean of\r\nConingsburgh\xe2\x80\x94Athelstane there, or what call they him? Their very names\r\nare an encumbrance to a Norman knight\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, and have, as it were, a\r\nflavour of bacon\xe2\x80\x94Give me a stoup of wine, as jolly Prince John said,\r\nthat I may wash away the relish\xe2\x80\x94place it in the armoury, and thither\r\nlead the prisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that Gothic apartment,\r\nhung with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he\r\nfound a flagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two Saxon\r\ncaptives under the guard of four of his dependants. Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf took\r\na long drought of wine, and then addressed his prisoners;\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\nmanner in which Wamba drew the cap over his face, the change of dress,\r\nthe gloomy and broken light, and the Baron\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect acquaintance\r\nwith the features of Cedric, (who avoided his Norman neighbours, and\r\nseldom stirred beyond his own domains,) prevented him from discovering\r\nthat the most important of his captives had made his escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGallants of England,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9chow relish ye your\r\nentertainment at Torquilstone?\xe2\x80\x94Are ye yet aware what your \xe2\x80\x98surquedy\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98outrecuidance\xe2\x80\x99 31 merit, for scoffing at the entertainment of a\r\nprince of the House of Anjou?\xe2\x80\x94Have ye forgotten how ye requited the\r\nunmerited hospitality of the royal John? By God and St Dennis, an ye\r\npay not the richer ransom, I will hang ye up by the feet from the iron\r\nbars of these windows, till the kites and hooded crows have made\r\nskeletons of you!\xe2\x80\x94Speak out, ye Saxon dogs\xe2\x80\x94what bid ye for your\r\nworthless lives?\xe2\x80\x94How say you, you of Rotherwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a doit I,\xe2\x80\x9d answered poor Wamba\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand for hanging up by the feet, my\r\nbrain has been topsy-turvy, they say, ever since the biggin was bound\r\nfirst round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore\r\nit again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaint Genevieve!\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have we got here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with the back of his hand he struck Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s cap from the head of\r\nthe Jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatal badge of\r\nservitude, the silver collar round his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiles\xe2\x80\x94Clement\xe2\x80\x94dogs and varlets!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the furious Norman, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nhave you brought me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, who just entered the\r\napartment. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s clown, who fought so manful a skirmish\r\nwith Isaac of York about a question of precedence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall settle it for them both,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cthey shall\r\nhang on the same gallows, unless his master and this boar of\r\nConingsburgh will pay well for their lives. Their wealth is the least\r\nthey can surrender; they must also carry off with them the swarms that\r\nare besetting the castle, subscribe a surrender of their pretended\r\nimmunities, and live under us as serfs and vassals; too happy if, in\r\nthe new world that is about to begin, we leave them the breath of their\r\nnostrils.\xe2\x80\x94Go,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to two of his attendants, \xe2\x80\x9cfetch me the right\r\nCedric hither, and I pardon your error for once; the rather that you\r\nbut mistook a fool for a Saxon franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cyour chivalrous excellency will find there are\r\nmore fools than franklins among us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat means the knave?\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, looking towards his\r\nfollowers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief, that\r\nif this were not Cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what\r\nwas become of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaints of Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9che must have escaped in the\r\nmonk\xe2\x80\x99s garments!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFiends of hell!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cit was then the boar of\r\nRotherwood whom I ushered to the postern, and dismissed with my own\r\nhands!\xe2\x80\x94And thou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose folly could overreach the\r\nwisdom of idiots yet more gross than thyself\xe2\x80\x94I will give thee holy\r\norders\xe2\x80\x94I will shave thy crown for thee!\xe2\x80\x94Here, let them tear the scalp\r\nfrom his head, and then pitch him headlong from the battlements\xe2\x80\x94Thy\r\ntrade is to jest, canst thou jest now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deal with me better than your word, noble knight,\xe2\x80\x9d whimpered forth\r\npoor Wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even by\r\nthe immediate prospect of death; \xe2\x80\x9cif you give me the red cap you\r\npropose, out of a simple monk you will make a cardinal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor wretch,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cis resolved to die in his\r\nvocation.\xe2\x80\x94Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, you shall not slay him. Give him to me to make\r\nsport for my Free Companions.\xe2\x80\x94How sayst thou, knave? Wilt thou take\r\nheart of grace, and go to the wars with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, with my master\xe2\x80\x99s leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, look you, I must not\r\nslip collar\xe2\x80\x9d (and he touched that which he wore) \xe2\x80\x9cwithout his\r\npermission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a Norman saw will soon cut a Saxon collar.\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, noble sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cand thence goes the proverb\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Norman saw on English oak,\r\nOn English neck a Norman yoke;\r\nNorman spoon in English dish,\r\nAnd England ruled as Normans wish;\r\nBlithe world to England never will be more,\r\nTill England\xe2\x80\x99s rid of all the four.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost well, De Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cto stand there\r\nlistening to a fool\xe2\x80\x99s jargon, when destruction is gaping for us! Seest\r\nthou not we are overreached, and that our proposed mode of\r\ncommunicating with our friends without has been disconcerted by this\r\nsame motley gentleman thou art so fond to brother? What views have we\r\nto expect but instant storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the battlements then,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen didst thou ever see me\r\nthe graver for the thoughts of battle? Call the Templar yonder, and let\r\nhim fight but half so well for his life as he has done for his\r\nOrder\xe2\x80\x94Make thou to the walls thyself with thy huge body\xe2\x80\x94Let me do my\r\npoor endeavour in my own way, and I tell thee the Saxon outlaws may as\r\nwell attempt to scale the clouds, as the castle of Torquilstone; or, if\r\nyou will treat with the banditti, why not employ the mediation of this\r\nworthy franklin, who seems in such deep contemplation of the\r\nwine-flagon?\xe2\x80\x94Here, Saxon,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing Athelstane, and\r\nhanding the cup to him, \xe2\x80\x9crinse thy throat with that noble liquor, and\r\nrouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt do for thy liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a man of mould may,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cproviding it be what a\r\nman of manhood ought.\xe2\x80\x94Dismiss me free, with my companions, and I will\r\npay a ransom of a thousand marks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who\r\nare swarming around the castle, contrary to God\xe2\x80\x99s peace and the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn so far as I can,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cI will withdraw them; and I\r\nfear not but that my father Cedric will do his best to assist me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are agreed then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthou and they are to be set\r\nat freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment of a thousand\r\nmarks. It is a trifling ransom, Saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude to\r\nthe moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons. But\r\nmark, this extends not to the Jew Isaac.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor to the Jew Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, who had now joined\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cbelong to this Saxon\xe2\x80\x99s company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI were unworthy to be called Christian, if they did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nAthelstane: \xe2\x80\x9cdeal with the unbelievers as ye list.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither does the ransom include the Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nshall never be said I was scared out of a fair prize without striking a\r\nblow for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes our treaty refer to this wretched\r\nJester, whom I retain, that I may make him an example to every knave\r\nwho turns jest into earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Athelstane, with the most steady\r\ncountenance, \xe2\x80\x9cis my affianced bride. I will be drawn by wild horses\r\nbefore I consent to part with her. The slave Wamba has this day saved\r\nthe life of my father Cedric\xe2\x80\x94I will lose mine ere a hair of his head be\r\ninjured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy affianced bride?\xe2\x80\x94The Lady Rowena the affianced bride of a vassal\r\nlike thee?\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cSaxon, thou dreamest that the days of thy\r\nseven kingdoms are returned again. I tell thee, the Princes of the\r\nHouse of Anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lineage, proud Norman,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cis drawn from a source\r\nmore pure and ancient than that of a beggarly Frenchman, whose living\r\nis won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his\r\npaltry standard. Kings were my ancestors, strong in war and wise in\r\ncouncil, who every day feasted in their hall more hundreds than thou\r\ncanst number individual followers; whose names have been sung by\r\nminstrels, and their laws recorded by Wittenagemotes; whose bones were\r\ninterred amid the prayers of saints, and over whose tombs minsters have\r\nbeen builded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast it, De Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, well pleased with the\r\nrebuff which his companion had received; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Saxon hath hit thee\r\nfairly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs fairly as a captive can strike,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, with apparent\r\ncarelessness; \xe2\x80\x9cfor he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at\r\nfreedom.\xe2\x80\x94But thy glibness of reply, comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined he, speaking to\r\nAthelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cwill not win the freedom of the Lady Rowena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this Athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his\r\ncustom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. The\r\nconversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced\r\nthat a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of Saint Bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9chave we a real monk this time, or another impostor?\r\nSearch him, slaves\xe2\x80\x94for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed upon\r\nyou, I will have your eyes torn out, and hot coals put into the\r\nsockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me endure the extremity of your anger, my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Giles, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nthis be not a real shaveling. Your squire Jocelyn knows him well, and\r\nwill vouch him to be brother Ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the\r\nPrior of Jorvaulx.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmit him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely he brings us news from\r\nhis jovial master. Surely the devil keeps holiday, and the priests are\r\nrelieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the\r\ncountry. Remove these prisoners; and, Saxon, think on what thou hast\r\nheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI claim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9can honourable imprisonment, with due care\r\nof my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one\r\nwho is in treaty for ransom. Moreover, I hold him that deems himself\r\nthe best of you, bound to answer to me with his body for this\r\naggression on my freedom. This defiance hath already been sent to thee\r\nby thy sewer; thou underliest it, and art bound to answer me\xe2\x80\x94There lies\r\nmy glove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answer not the challenge of my prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cnor\r\nshalt thou, Maurice de Bracy.\xe2\x80\x94Giles,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9chang the\r\nfranklin\xe2\x80\x99s glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers: there shall\r\nit remain until he is a free man. Should he then presume to demand it,\r\nor to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of Saint\r\nChristopher, he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe\r\non foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced\r\nthe monk Ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the real \xe2\x80\x98Deus vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, as he passed the\r\nreverend brother; \xe2\x80\x9cthe others were but counterfeits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the monk, as he addressed the assembled knights, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam at last safe and in Christian keeping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe thou art,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cand for Christianity, here is the\r\nstout Baron Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, whose utter abomination is a Jew;\r\nand the good Knight Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whose trade is to\r\nslay Saracens\xe2\x80\x94If these are not good marks of Christianity, I know no\r\nother which they bear about them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are friends and allies of our reverend father in God, Aymer, Prior\r\nof Jorvaulx,\xe2\x80\x9d said the monk, without noticing the tone of De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply; \xe2\x80\x9cye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for\r\nwhat saith the blessed Saint Augustin, in his treatise \xe2\x80\x98De Civitate\r\nDei\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat saith the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cor rather what dost\r\nthou say, Sir Priest? We have little time to hear texts from the holy\r\nfathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Sancta Maria!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Father Ambrose, \xe2\x80\x9chow prompt to ire are\r\nthese unhallowed laymen!\xe2\x80\x94But be it known to you, brave knights, that\r\ncertain murderous caitiffs, casting behind them fear of God, and\r\nreverence of his church, and not regarding the bull of the holy see,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Si quis, suadende Diabolo\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9call this we know or guess at\xe2\x80\x94tell\r\nus plainly, is thy master, the Prior, made prisoner, and to whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ambrose, \xe2\x80\x9che is in the hands of the men of Belial,\r\ninfesters of these woods, and contemners of the holy text, \xe2\x80\x98Touch not\r\nmine anointed, and do my prophets naught of evil.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a new argument for our swords, sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\r\nturning to his companions; \xe2\x80\x9cand so, instead of reaching us any\r\nassistance, the Prior of Jorvaulx requests aid at our hands? a man is\r\nwell helped of these lazy churchmen when he hath most to do!\xe2\x80\x94But speak\r\nout, priest, and say at once, what doth thy master expect from us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo please you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ambrose, \xe2\x80\x9cviolent hands having been imposed on my\r\nreverend superior, contrary to the holy ordinance which I did already\r\nquote, and the men of Belial having rifled his mails and budgets, and\r\nstripped him of two hundred marks of pure refined gold, they do yet\r\ndemand of him a large sum beside, ere they will suffer him to depart\r\nfrom their uncircumcised hands. Wherefore the reverend father in God\r\nprays you, as his dear friends, to rescue him, either by paying down\r\nthe ransom at which they hold him, or by force of arms, at your best\r\ndiscretion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foul fiend quell the Prior!\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9chis morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrought has been a deep one. When did thy master hear of a Norman baron\r\nunbuckling his purse to relieve a churchman, whose bags are ten times\r\nas weighty as ours?\xe2\x80\x94And how can we do aught by valour to free him, that\r\nare cooped up here by ten times our number, and expect an assault every\r\nmoment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was what I was about to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the monk, \xe2\x80\x9chad your\r\nhastiness allowed me time. But, God help me, I am old, and these foul\r\nonslaughts distract an aged man\xe2\x80\x99s brain. Nevertheless, it is of verity\r\nthat they assemble a camp, and raise a bank against the walls of this\r\ncastle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the battlements!\xe2\x80\x9d cried De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cand let us mark what these\r\nknaves do without;\xe2\x80\x9d and so saying, he opened a latticed window which\r\nled to a sort of bartisan or projecting balcony, and immediately called\r\nfrom thence to those in the apartment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSaint Dennis, but the old monk\r\nhath brought true tidings!\xe2\x80\x94They bring forward mantelets and pavisses,\r\n32 and the archers muster on the skirts of the wood like a dark cloud\r\nbefore a hailstorm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf also looked out upon the field, and immediately\r\nsnatched his bugle; and, after winding a long and loud blast, commanded\r\nhis men to their posts on the walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Bracy, look to the eastern side, where the walls are lowest\xe2\x80\x94Noble\r\nBois-Guilbert, thy trade hath well taught thee how to attack and\r\ndefend, look thou to the western side\xe2\x80\x94I myself will take post at the\r\nbarbican. Yet, do not confine your exertions to any one spot, noble\r\nfriends!\xe2\x80\x94we must this day be everywhere, and multiply ourselves, were\r\nit possible, so as to carry by our presence succour and relief wherever\r\nthe attack is hottest. Our numbers are few, but activity and courage\r\nmay supply that defect, since we have only to do with rascal clowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, noble knights,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Father Ambrose, amidst the bustle and\r\nconfusion occasioned by the preparations for defence, \xe2\x80\x9cwill none of ye\r\nhear the message of the reverend father in God Aymer, Prior of\r\nJorvaulx?\xe2\x80\x94I beseech thee to hear me, noble Sir Reginald!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo patter thy petitions to heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fierce Norman, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we on\r\nearth have no time to listen to them.\xe2\x80\x94Ho! there, Anselm I see that\r\nseething pitch and oil are ready to pour on the heads of these\r\naudacious traitors\xe2\x80\x94Look that the cross-bowmen lack not bolts. 33\xe2\x80\x94Fling\r\nabroad my banner with the old bull\xe2\x80\x99s head\xe2\x80\x94the knaves shall soon find\r\nwith whom they have to do this day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, noble sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the monk, persevering in his endeavours to\r\ndraw attention, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider my vow of obedience, and let me discharge\r\nmyself of my Superior\xe2\x80\x99s errand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway with this prating dotard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9clock him up in\r\nthe chapel, to tell his beads till the broil be over. It will be a new\r\nthing to the saints in Torquilstone to hear aves and paters; they have\r\nnot been so honoured, I trow, since they were cut out of stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlaspheme not the holy saints, Sir Reginald,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\nhave need of their aid to-day before yon rascal rout disband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect little aid from their hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cunless we\r\nwere to hurl them from the battlements on the heads of the villains.\r\nThere is a huge lumbering Saint Christopher yonder, sufficient to bear\r\na whole company to the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Templar had in the meantime been looking out on the proceedings of\r\nthe besiegers, with rather more attention than the brutal Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\r\nor his giddy companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the faith of mine order,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese men approach with more\r\ntouch of discipline than could have been judged, however they come by\r\nit. See ye how dexterously they avail themselves of every cover which a\r\ntree or bush affords, and shun exposing themselves to the shot of our\r\ncross-bows? I spy neither banner nor pennon among them, and yet will I\r\ngage my golden chain, that they are led on by some noble knight or\r\ngentleman, skilful in the practice of wars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI espy him,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI see the waving of a knight\xe2\x80\x99s crest, and\r\nthe gleam of his armour. See yon tall man in the black mail, who is\r\nbusied marshalling the farther troop of the rascaille yeomen\xe2\x80\x94by Saint\r\nDennis, I hold him to be the same whom we called \xe2\x80\x98Le Noir Faineant\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nwho overthrew thee, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, in the lists at Ashby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he comes here to give\r\nme my revenge. Some hilding fellow he must be, who dared not stay to\r\nassert his claim to the tourney prize which chance had assigned him. I\r\nshould in vain have sought for him where knights and nobles seek their\r\nfoes, and right glad am I he hath here shown himself among yon villain\r\nyeomanry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s immediate approach cut off all\r\nfarther discourse. Each knight repaired to his post, and at the head of\r\nthe few followers whom they were able to muster, and who were in\r\nnumbers inadequate to defend the whole extent of the walls, they\r\nawaited with calm determination the threatened assault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThis wandering race, sever\xe2\x80\x99d from other men,\r\nBoast yet their intercourse with human arts;\r\nThe seas, the woods, the deserts, which they haunt,\r\nFind them acquainted with their secret treasures:\r\nAnd unregarded herbs, and flowers, and blossoms,\r\nDisplay undreamt-of powers when gather\xe2\x80\x99d by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JEW\r\n\r\n\r\nOur history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to\r\ninform the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the\r\nrest of this important narrative. His own intelligence may indeed have\r\neasily anticipated that, when Ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned\r\nby all the world, it was the importunity of Rebecca which prevailed on\r\nher father to have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists\r\nto the house which for the time the Jews inhabited in the suburbs of\r\nAshby.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been difficult to have persuaded Isaac to this step\r\nin any other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful.\r\nBut he had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his\r\npersecuted people, and those were to be conquered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Abraham!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9che is a good youth, and my heart bleeds\r\nto see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and his\r\ncorslet of goodly price\xe2\x80\x94but to carry him to our house!\xe2\x80\x94damsel, hast\r\nthou well considered?\xe2\x80\x94he is a Christian, and by our law we may not deal\r\nwith the stranger and Gentile, save for the advantage of our commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak not so, my dear father,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cwe may not indeed mix\r\nwith them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery, the\r\nGentile becometh the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would I knew what the Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied Isaac;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to death.\r\nLet Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, let them place him in my litter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cI will mount one\r\nof the palfreys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of Ishmael and of\r\nEdom,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of\r\nknights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her\r\ncharitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until\r\nIsaac, seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried\r\nvoice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBeard of Aaron!\xe2\x80\x94what if the youth perish!\xe2\x80\x94if he die in our\r\ncustody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to\r\npieces by the multitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not die, my father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, gently extricating herself\r\nfrom the grasp of Isaac \xe2\x80\x9che will not die unless we abandon him; and if\r\nso, we are indeed answerable for his blood to God and to man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, releasing his hold, \xe2\x80\x9cit grieveth me as much to see\r\nthe drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from\r\nmine own purse; and I well know, that the lessons of Miriam, daughter\r\nof the Rabbi Manasses of Byzantium whose soul is in Paradise, have made\r\nthee skilful in the art of healing, and that thou knowest the craft of\r\nherbs, and the force of elixirs. Therefore, do as thy mind giveth\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94thou art a good damsel, a blessing, and a crown, and a song of\r\nrejoicing unto me and unto my house, and unto the people of my\r\nfathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe apprehensions of Isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the\r\ngenerous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her\r\nreturn to Ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The\r\nTemplar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold and\r\nardent look on the beautiful Jewess; and we have already seen the\r\nconsequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident\r\nthrew her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.\r\n\r\nRebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their\r\ntemporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and to\r\nbind up his wounds. The youngest reader of romances and romantic\r\nballads, must recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as\r\nthey are called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how\r\nfrequently the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her\r\ncure, whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.\r\n\r\nBut the Jews, both male and female, possessed and practised the medical\r\nscience in all its branches, and the monarchs and powerful barons of\r\nthe time frequently committed themselves to the charge of some\r\nexperienced sage among this despised people, when wounded or in\r\nsickness. The aid of the Jewish physicians was not the less eagerly\r\nsought after, though a general belief prevailed among the Christians,\r\nthat the Jewish Rabbins were deeply acquainted with the occult\r\nsciences, and particularly with the cabalistical art, which had its\r\nname and origin in the studies of the sages of Israel. Neither did the\r\nRabbins disown such acquaintance with supernatural arts, which added\r\nnothing (for what could add aught?) to the hatred with which their\r\nnation was regarded, while it diminished the contempt with which that\r\nmalevolence was mingled. A Jewish magician might be the subject of\r\nequal abhorrence with a Jewish usurer, but he could not be equally\r\ndespised. It is besides probable, considering the wonderful cures they\r\nare said to have performed, that the Jews possessed some secrets of the\r\nhealing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with the exclusive\r\nspirit arising out of their condition, they took great care to conceal\r\nfrom the Christians amongst whom they dwelt.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the\r\nknowledge proper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had\r\nretained, arranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond\r\nher years, her sex, and even the age in which she lived. Her knowledge\r\nof medicine and of the healing art had been acquired under an aged\r\nJewess, the daughter of one of their most celebrated doctors, who loved\r\nRebecca as her own child, and was believed to have communicated to her\r\nsecrets, which had been left to herself by her sage father at the same\r\ntime, and under the same circumstances. The fate of Miriam had indeed\r\nbeen to fall a sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times; but her\r\nsecrets had survived in her apt pupil.\r\n\r\nRebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally\r\nrevered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of\r\nthose gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. Her father himself,\r\nout of reverence for her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself\r\nwith his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty\r\nthan was usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her\r\npeople, and was, as we have just seen, frequently guided by her\r\nopinion, even in preference to his own.\r\n\r\nWhen Ivanhoe reached the habitation of Isaac, he was still in a state\r\nof unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken\r\nplace during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound,\r\nand having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed,\r\ninformed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great\r\nbleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of\r\nMiriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlife, and that he might with safety travel to York with them on the\r\nensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His\r\ncharity would willingly have stopped short at Ashby, or at most would\r\nhave left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he was\r\nresiding at present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it\r\nbelonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this,\r\nhowever, Rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention\r\ntwo that had peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on\r\nno account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another\r\nphysician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be\r\ndiscovered; the other, that this wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\r\nwas an intimate favourite of Richard C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion, and that, in case\r\nthe monarch should return, Isaac, who had supplied his brother John\r\nwith treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no\r\nsmall need of a powerful protector who enjoyed Richard\xe2\x80\x99s favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art speaking but sooth, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, giving way to these\r\nweighty arguments\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit were an offending of Heaven to betray the secrets\r\nof the blessed Miriam; for the good which Heaven giveth, is not rashly\r\nto be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and shekels\r\nof silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise\r\nphysician\xe2\x80\x94assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom\r\nProvidence hath vouchsafed them. And him whom the Nazarenes of England\r\ncall the Lion\xe2\x80\x99s Heart, assuredly it were better for me to fall into the\r\nhands of a strong lion of Idumea than into his, if he shall have got\r\nassurance of my dealing with his brother. Wherefore I will lend ear to\r\nthy counsel, and this youth shall journey with us unto York, and our\r\nhouse shall be as a home to him until his wounds shall be healed. And\r\nif he of the Lion Heart shall return to the land, as is now noised\r\nabroad, then shall this Wilfred of Ivanhoe be unto me as a wall of\r\ndefence, when the king\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure shall burn high against thy\r\nfather. And if he doth not return, this Wilfred may natheless repay us\r\nour charges when he shall gain treasure by the strength of his spear\r\nand of his sword, even as he did yesterday and this day also. For the\r\nyouth is a good youth, and keepeth the day which he appointeth, and\r\nrestoreth that which he borroweth, and succoureth the Israelite, even\r\nthe child of my father\xe2\x80\x99s house, when he is encompassed by strong\r\nthieves and sons of Belial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not until evening was nearly closed that Ivanhoe was restored to\r\nconsciousness of his situation. He awoke from a broken slumber, under\r\nthe confused impressions which are naturally attendant on the recovery\r\nfrom a state of insensibility. He was unable for some time to recall\r\nexactly to memory the circumstances which had preceded his fall in the\r\nlists, or to make out any connected chain of the events in which he had\r\nbeen engaged upon the yesterday. A sense of wounds and injury, joined\r\nto great weakness and exhaustion, was mingled with the recollection of\r\nblows dealt and received, of steeds rushing upon each other,\r\noverthrowing and overthrown\xe2\x80\x94of shouts and clashing of arms, and all the\r\nheady tumult of a confused fight. An effort to draw aside the curtain\r\nof his couch was in some degree successful, although rendered difficult\r\nby the pain of his wound.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise he found himself in a room magnificently\r\nfurnished, but having cushions instead of chairs to rest upon, and in\r\nother respects partaking so much of Oriental costume, that he began to\r\ndoubt whether he had not, during his sleep, been transported back again\r\nto the land of Palestine. The impression was increased, when, the\r\ntapestry being drawn aside, a female form, dressed in a rich habit,\r\nwhich partook more of the Eastern taste than that of Europe, glided\r\nthrough the door which it concealed, and was followed by a swarthy\r\ndomestic.\r\n\r\nAs the wounded knight was about to address this fair apparition, she\r\nimposed silence by placing her slender finger upon her ruby lips, while\r\nthe attendant, approaching him, proceeded to uncover Ivanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nand the lovely Jewess satisfied herself that the bandage was in its\r\nplace, and the wound doing well. She performed her task with a graceful\r\nand dignified simplicity and modesty, which might, even in more\r\ncivilized days, have served to redeem it from whatever might seem\r\nrepugnant to female delicacy. The idea of so young and beautiful a\r\nperson engaged in attendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of\r\none of a different sex, was melted away and lost in that of a\r\nbeneficent being contributing her effectual aid to relieve pain, and to\r\navert the stroke of death. Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s few and brief directions were\r\ngiven in the Hebrew language to the old domestic; and he, who had been\r\nfrequently her assistant in similar cases, obeyed them without reply.\r\n\r\nThe accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded\r\nwhen uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful Rebecca, the\r\nromantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms\r\npronounced by some beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the\r\near, but, from the sweetness of utterance, and benignity of aspect,\r\nwhich accompanied them, touching and affecting to the heart. Without\r\nmaking an attempt at further question, Ivanhoe suffered them in silence\r\nto take the measures they thought most proper for his recovery; and it\r\nwas not until those were completed, and this kind physician about to\r\nretire, that his curiosity could no longer be suppressed.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGentle\r\nmaiden,\xe2\x80\x9d he began in the Arabian tongue, with which his Eastern travels\r\nhad rendered him familiar, and which he thought most likely to be\r\nunderstood by the turban\xe2\x80\x99d and caftan\xe2\x80\x99d damsel who stood before him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npray you, gentle maiden, of your courtesy\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she\r\ncould scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general\r\nexpression was that of contemplative melancholy. \xe2\x80\x9cI am of England, Sir\r\nKnight, and speak the English tongue, although my dress and my lineage\r\nbelong to another climate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoble damsel,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94again the Knight of Ivanhoe began; and again Rebecca\r\nhastened to interrupt him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBestow not on me, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe epithet of noble. It is\r\nwell you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor Jewess,\r\nthe daughter of that Isaac of York, to whom you were so lately a good\r\nand kind lord. It well becomes him, and those of his household, to\r\nrender to you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily\r\ndemands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI know not whether the fair Rowena would have been altogether satisfied\r\nwith the species of emotion with which her devoted knight had hitherto\r\ngazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of\r\nthe lovely Rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were,\r\nmellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a\r\nminstrel would have compared to the evening star darting its rays\r\nthrough a bower of jessamine. But Ivanhoe was too good a Catholic to\r\nretain the same class of feelings towards a Jewess. This Rebecca had\r\nforeseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s name and lineage; yet\xe2\x80\x94for the fair and wise daughter of Isaac\r\nwas not without a touch of female weakness\xe2\x80\x94she could not but sigh\r\ninternally when the glance of respectful admiration, not altogether\r\nunmixed with tenderness, with which Ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his\r\nunknown benefactress, was exchanged at once for a manner cold,\r\ncomposed, and collected, and fraught with no deeper feeling than that\r\nwhich expressed a grateful sense of courtesy received from an\r\nunexpected quarter, and from one of an inferior race. It was not that\r\nIvanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s former carriage expressed more than that general devotional\r\nhomage which youth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying that\r\none word should operate as a spell to remove poor Rebecca, who could\r\nnot be supposed altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a\r\ndegraded class, to whom it could not be honourably rendered.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleness and candour of Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s nature imputed no fault to\r\nIvanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and\r\nreligion. On the contrary the fair Jewess, though sensible her patient\r\nnow regarded her as one of a race of reprobation, with whom it was\r\ndisgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased\r\nnot to pay the same patient and devoted attention to his safety and\r\nconvalescence. She informed him of the necessity they were under of\r\nremoving to York, and of her father\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to transport him\r\nthither, and tend him in his own house until his health should be\r\nrestored. Ivanhoe expressed great repugnance to this plan, which he\r\ngrounded on unwillingness to give farther trouble to his benefactors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin Ashby, or near it, some Saxon franklin,\r\nor even some wealthy peasant, who would endure the burden of a wounded\r\ncountryman\xe2\x80\x99s residence with him until he should be again able to bear\r\nhis armour?\xe2\x80\x94Was there no convent of Saxon endowment, where he could be\r\nreceived?\xe2\x80\x94Or could he not be transported as far as Burton, where he was\r\nsure to find hospitality with Waltheoff, the Abbot of St Withold\xe2\x80\x99s, to\r\nwhom he was related?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny, the worst of these harbourages,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, with a melancholy\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cwould unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than\r\nthe abode of a despised Jew; yet, Sir Knight, unless you would dismiss\r\nyour physician, you cannot change your lodging. Our nation, as you well\r\nknow, can cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in\r\nour own family, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down\r\nsince the days of Solomon, and of which you have already experienced\r\nthe advantages. No Nazarene\xe2\x80\x94I crave your forgiveness, Sir Knight\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nChristian leech, within the four seas of Britain, could enable you to\r\nbear your corslet within a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how soon wilt THOU enable me to brook it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my\r\ndirections,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Our Blessed Lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be not a sin to name her\r\nhere, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if\r\nthou accomplish thy promise, maiden, I will pay thee with my casque\r\nfull of crowns, come by them as I may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will accomplish my promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand thou shalt bear\r\nthine armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but\r\none boon in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it be within my power, and such as a true Christian knight may\r\nyield to one of thy people,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cI will grant thy boon\r\nblithely and thankfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI will but pray of thee to believe\r\nhenceforward that a Jew may do good service to a Christian, without\r\ndesiring other guerdon than the blessing of the Great Father who made\r\nboth Jew and Gentile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were sin to doubt it, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cand I repose\r\nmyself on thy skill without further scruple or question, well trusting\r\nyou will enable me to bear my corslet on the eighth day. And now, my\r\nkind leech, let me enquire of the news abroad. What of the noble Saxon\r\nCedric and his household?\xe2\x80\x94what of the lovely Lady\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopt, as if\r\nunwilling to speak Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s name in the house of a Jew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOf her, I mean,\r\nwho was named Queen of the tournament?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who was selected by you, Sir Knight, to hold that dignity, with\r\njudgment which was admired as much as your valour,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca.\r\n\r\nThe blood which Ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing\r\nhis cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in\r\nRowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was less of her I would speak,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthan of Prince John; and\r\nI would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now attends\r\nme not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me use my authority as a leech,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand enjoin you\r\nto keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst I apprize you\r\nof what you desire to know. Prince John hath broken off the tournament,\r\nand set forward in all haste towards York, with the nobles, knights,\r\nand churchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could\r\nwring, by fair means or foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy\r\nof the land. It is said he designs to assume his brother\xe2\x80\x99s crown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot without a blow struck in its defence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, raising\r\nhimself upon the couch, \xe2\x80\x9cif there were but one true subject in England\r\nI will fight for Richard\xe2\x80\x99s title with the best of them\xe2\x80\x94ay, one or two,\r\nin his just quarrel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that you may be able to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca touching his shoulder\r\nwith her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cas quiet as these disquieted times will\r\npermit\xe2\x80\x94And of Cedric and his household?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis steward came but brief while since,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess, \xe2\x80\x9cpanting\r\nwith haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the\r\ngrowth of Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s flocks, and from him I learned that Cedric and\r\nAthelstane of Coningsburgh had left Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s lodging in high\r\ndispleasure, and were about to set forth on their return homeward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWent any lady with them to the banquet?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, answering the question with more\r\nprecision than it had been asked\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lady Rowena went not to the\r\nPrince\xe2\x80\x99s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her\r\njourney back to Rotherwood, with her guardian Cedric. And touching your\r\nfaithful squire Gurth\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cknowest thou his name?\xe2\x80\x94But thou dost,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nimmediately added, \xe2\x80\x9cand well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,\r\nas I am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he\r\nreceived but yesterday a hundred zecchins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak not of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, blushing deeply; \xe2\x80\x9cI see how easy it\r\nis for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this sum of gold,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cmy honour is concerned\r\nin repaying it to your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be as thou wilt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen eight days have passed\r\naway; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy\r\nrecovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so, kind maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cI were most ungrateful to\r\ndispute thy commands. But one word of the fate of poor Gurth, and I\r\nhave done with questioning thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI grieve to tell thee, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jewess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is\r\nin custody by the order of Cedric.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And then observing the distress\r\nwhich her communication gave to Wilfred, she instantly added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut the\r\nsteward Oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndispleasure against him, he was sure that Cedric would pardon Gurth, a\r\nfaithful serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but\r\ncommitted this error out of the love which he bore to Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s son. And\r\nhe said, moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially Wamba the\r\nJester, were resolved to warn Gurth to make his escape by the way, in\r\ncase Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s ire against him could not be mitigated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould to God they may keep their purpose!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it seems\r\nas if I were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness\r\nto me. My king, by whom I was honoured and distinguished, thou seest\r\nthat the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his\r\ncrown;\xe2\x80\x94my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of\r\nher sex;\xe2\x80\x94and now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman but\r\nfor his love and loyal service to me!\xe2\x80\x94Thou seest, maiden, what an\r\nill-fated wretch thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go,\r\nere the misfortunes which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall\r\ninvolve thee also in their pursuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthy weakness and thy grief, Sir Knight, make thee\r\nmiscalculate the purposes of Heaven. Thou hast been restored to thy\r\ncountry when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true\r\nheart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of\r\nthy king, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil\r\nwhich thou hast sustained, seest thou not that Heaven has raised thee a\r\nhelper and a physician, even among the most despised of the\r\nland?\xe2\x80\x94Therefore, be of good courage, and trust that thou art preserved\r\nfor some marvel which thine arm shall work before this people.\r\nAdieu\xe2\x80\x94and having taken the medicine which I shall send thee by the hand\r\nof Reuben, compose thyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more\r\nable to endure the journey on the succeeding day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of\r\nRebecca. The drought which Reuben administered was of a sedative and\r\nnarcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed\r\nslumbers. In the morning his kind physician found him entirely free\r\nfrom feverish symptoms, and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey.\r\n\r\nHe was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the\r\nlists, and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. In one\r\ncircumstance only even the entreaties of Rebecca were unable to secure\r\nsufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight. Isaac,\r\nlike the enriched traveller of Juvenal\xe2\x80\x99s tenth satire, had ever the\r\nfear of robbery before his eyes, conscious that he would be alike\r\naccounted fair game by the marauding Norman noble, and by the Saxon\r\noutlaw. He therefore journeyed at a great rate, and made short halts,\r\nand shorter repasts, so that he passed by Cedric and Athelstane who had\r\nseveral hours the start of him, but who had been delayed by their\r\nprotracted feasting at the convent of Saint Withold\xe2\x80\x99s. Yet such was the\r\nvirtue of Miriam\xe2\x80\x99s balsam, or such the strength of Ivanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstitution, that he did not sustain from the hurried journey that\r\ninconvenience which his kind physician had apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn another point of view, however, the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s haste proved somewhat more\r\nthan good speed. The rapidity with which he insisted on travelling,\r\nbred several disputes between him and the party whom he had hired to\r\nattend him as a guard. These men were Saxons, and not free by any means\r\nfrom the national love of ease and good living which the Normans\r\nstigmatized as laziness and gluttony. Reversing Shylock\xe2\x80\x99s position,\r\nthey had accepted the employment in hopes of feeding upon the wealthy\r\nJew, and were very much displeased when they found themselves\r\ndisappointed, by the rapidity with which he insisted on their\r\nproceeding. They remonstrated also upon the risk of damage to their\r\nhorses by these forced marches. Finally, there arose betwixt Isaac and\r\nhis satellites a deadly feud, concerning the quantity of wine and ale\r\nto be allowed for consumption at each meal. And thus it happened, that\r\nwhen the alarm of danger approached, and that which Isaac feared was\r\nlikely to come upon him, he was deserted by the discontented\r\nmercenaries on whose protection he had relied, without using the means\r\nnecessary to secure their attachment.\r\n\r\nIn this deplorable condition the Jew, with his daughter and her wounded\r\npatient, were found by Cedric, as has already been noticed, and soon\r\nafterwards fell into the power of De Bracy and his confederates. Little\r\nnotice was at first taken of the horse-litter, and it might have\r\nremained behind but for the curiosity of De Bracy, who looked into it\r\nunder the impression that it might contain the object of his\r\nenterprise, for Rowena had not unveiled herself. But De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishment was considerable, when he discovered that the litter\r\ncontained a wounded man, who, conceiving himself to have fallen into\r\nthe power of Saxon outlaws, with whom his name might be a protection\r\nfor himself and his friends, frankly avowed himself to be Wilfred of\r\nIvanhoe.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of chivalrous honour, which, amidst his wildness and levity,\r\nnever utterly abandoned De Bracy, prohibited him from doing the knight\r\nany injury in his defenceless condition, and equally interdicted his\r\nbetraying him to Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, who would have had no scruples to put\r\nto death, under any circumstances, the rival claimant of the fief of\r\nIvanhoe. On the other hand, to liberate a suitor preferred by the Lady\r\nRowena, as the events of the tournament, and indeed Wilfred\xe2\x80\x99s previous\r\nbanishment from his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, had made matter of notoriety, was a\r\npitch far above the flight of De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s generosity. A middle course\r\nbetwixt good and evil was all which he found himself capable of\r\nadopting, and he commanded two of his own squires to keep close by the\r\nlitter, and to suffer no one to approach it. If questioned, they were\r\ndirected by their master to say, that the empty litter of the Lady\r\nRowena was employed to transport one of their comrades who had been\r\nwounded in the scuffle. On arriving at Torquilstone, while the Knight\r\nTemplar and the lord of that castle were each intent upon their own\r\nschemes, the one on the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s treasure, and the other on his daughter,\r\nDe Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s squires conveyed Ivanhoe, still under the name of a wounded\r\ncomrade, to a distant apartment. This explanation was accordingly\r\nreturned by these men to Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, when he questioned them why\r\nthey did not make for the battlements upon the alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wounded companion!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in great wrath and astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nwonder that churls and yeomen wax so presumptuous as even to lay\r\nleaguer before castles, and that clowns and swineherds send defiances\r\nto nobles, since men-at-arms have turned sick men\xe2\x80\x99s nurses, and Free\r\nCompanions are grown keepers of dying folk\xe2\x80\x99s curtains, when the castle\r\nis about to be assailed.\xe2\x80\x94To the battlements, ye loitering villains!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, raising his stentorian voice till the arches around rung\r\nagain, \xe2\x80\x9cto the battlements, or I will splinter your bones with this\r\ntruncheon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men sulkily replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they desired nothing better than to go\r\nto the battlements, providing Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf would bear them out with\r\ntheir master, who had commanded them to tend the dying man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dying man, knaves!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the Baron; \xe2\x80\x9cI promise thee we shall\r\nall be dying men an we stand not to it the more stoutly. But I will\r\nrelieve the guard upon this caitiff companion of yours.\xe2\x80\x94Here,\r\nUrfried\xe2\x80\x94hag\xe2\x80\x94fiend of a Saxon witch\xe2\x80\x94hearest me not?\xe2\x80\x94tend me this\r\nbedridden fellow since he must needs be tended, whilst these knaves use\r\ntheir weapons.\xe2\x80\x94Here be two arblasts, comrades, with windlaces and\r\nquarrells 34\xe2\x80\x94to the barbican with you, and see you drive each bolt\r\nthrough a Saxon brain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise\r\nand detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they\r\nwere commanded, and thus the charge of Ivanhoe was transferred to\r\nUrfried, or Ulrica. But she, whose brain was burning with remembrance\r\nof injuries and with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve\r\nupon Rebecca the care of her patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAscend the watch-tower yonder, valiant soldier,\r\nLook on the field, and say how goes the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHILLER\xe2\x80\x99S MAID OF ORLEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nA moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and\r\naffection. We are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our\r\nfeelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil\r\nperiods, our prudence at least conceals, if it cannot altogether\r\nsuppress them. In finding herself once more by the side of Ivanhoe,\r\nRebecca was astonished at the keen sensation of pleasure which she\r\nexperienced, even at a time when all around them both was danger, if\r\nnot despair. As she felt his pulse, and enquired after his health,\r\nthere was a softness in her touch and in her accents implying a kinder\r\ninterest than she would herself have been pleased to have voluntarily\r\nexpressed. Her voice faltered and her hand trembled, and it was only\r\nthe cold question of Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, gentle maiden?\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nrecalled her to herself, and reminded her the sensations which she felt\r\nwere not and could not be mutual. A sigh escaped, but it was scarce\r\naudible; and the questions which she asked the knight concerning his\r\nstate of health were put in the tone of calm friendship. Ivanhoe\r\nanswered her hastily that he was, in point of health, as well, and\r\nbetter than he could have expected\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdear Rebecca, to\r\nthy helpful skill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls me DEAR Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maiden to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is in\r\nthe cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. His war-horse\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nhunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised Jewess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind, gentle maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cis more disturbed by\r\nanxiety, than my body with pain. From the speeches of those men who\r\nwere my warders just now, I learn that I am a prisoner, and, if I judge\r\naright of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence on\r\nsome military duty, I am in the castle of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x94If so, how will\r\nthis end, or how can I protect Rowena and my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe names not the Jew or Jewess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca internally; \xe2\x80\x9cyet what is\r\nour portion in him, and how justly am I punished by Heaven for letting\r\nmy thoughts dwell upon him!\xe2\x80\x9d She hastened after this brief\r\nself-accusation to give Ivanhoe what information she could; but it\r\namounted only to this, that the Templar Bois-Guilbert, and the Baron\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, were commanders within the castle; that it was\r\nbeleaguered from without, but by whom she knew not. She added, that\r\nthere was a Christian priest within the castle who might be possessed\r\nof more information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Christian priest!\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, joyfully; \xe2\x80\x9cfetch him hither,\r\nRebecca, if thou canst\xe2\x80\x94say a sick man desires his ghostly counsel\xe2\x80\x94say\r\nwhat thou wilt, but bring him\xe2\x80\x94something I must do or attempt, but how\r\ncan I determine until I know how matters stand without?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRebecca in compliance with the wishes of Ivanhoe, made that attempt to\r\nbring Cedric into the wounded Knight\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, which was defeated as\r\nwe have already seen by the interference of Urfried, who had also been\r\non the watch to intercept the supposed monk. Rebecca retired to\r\ncommunicate to Ivanhoe the result of her errand.\r\n\r\nThey had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of\r\nintelligence, or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; for\r\nthe noise within the castle, occasioned by the defensive preparations\r\nwhich had been considerable for some time, now increased into tenfold\r\nbustle and clamour. The heavy, yet hasty step of the men-at-arms,\r\ntraversed the battlements or resounded on the narrow and winding\r\npassages and stairs which led to the various bartisans and points of\r\ndefence. The voices of the knights were heard, animating their\r\nfollowers, or directing means of defence, while their commands were\r\noften drowned in the clashing of armour, or the clamorous shouts of\r\nthose whom they addressed. Tremendous as these sounds were, and yet\r\nmore terrible from the awful event which they presaged, there was a\r\nsublimity mixed with them, which Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s high-toned mind could feel\r\neven in that moment of terror. Her eye kindled, although the blood fled\r\nfrom her cheeks; and there was a strong mixture of fear, and of a\r\nthrilling sense of the sublime, as she repeated, half whispering to\r\nherself, half speaking to her companion, the sacred text,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe quiver\r\nrattleth\xe2\x80\x94the glittering spear and the shield\xe2\x80\x94the noise of the captains\r\nand the shouting!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing\r\nwith impatience at his inactivity, and with his ardent desire to mingle\r\nin the affray of which these sounds were the introduction. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could\r\nbut drag myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto yonder window, that I might see how this\r\nbrave game is like to go\xe2\x80\x94If I had but bow to shoot a shaft, or\r\nbattle-axe to strike were it but a single blow for our deliverance!\xe2\x80\x94It\r\nis in vain\xe2\x80\x94it is in vain\xe2\x80\x94I am alike nerveless and weaponless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFret not thyself, noble knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sounds have\r\nceased of a sudden\xe2\x80\x94it may be they join not battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest nought of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cthis dead\r\npause only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, and\r\nexpecting an instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant\r\nmuttering of the storm\xe2\x80\x94it will burst anon in all its fury.\xe2\x80\x94Could I but\r\nreach yonder window!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nhis attendant. Observing his extreme solicitude, she firmly added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmyself will stand at the lattice, and describe to you as I can what\r\npasses without.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not\xe2\x80\x94you shall not!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9ceach lattice, each\r\naperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some random shaft\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be welcome!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Rebecca, as with firm pace she ascended\r\ntwo or three steps, which led to the window of which they spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca, dear Rebecca!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no maiden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npastime\xe2\x80\x94do not expose thyself to wounds and death, and render me for\r\never miserable for having given the occasion; at least, cover thyself\r\nwith yonder ancient buckler, and show as little of your person at the\r\nlattice as may be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFollowing with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe, and\r\navailing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield, which\r\nshe placed against the lower part of the window, Rebecca, with\r\ntolerable security to herself, could witness part of what was passing\r\nwithout the castle, and report to Ivanhoe the preparations which the\r\nassailants were making for the storm. Indeed the situation which she\r\nthus obtained was peculiarly favourable for this purpose, because,\r\nbeing placed on an angle of the main building, Rebecca could not only\r\nsee what passed beyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded\r\na view of the outwork likely to be the first object of the meditated\r\nassault. It was an exterior fortification of no great height or\r\nstrength, intended to protect the postern-gate, through which Cedric\r\nhad been recently dismissed by Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf. The castle moat divided\r\nthis species of barbican from the rest of the fortress, so that, in\r\ncase of its being taken, it was easy to cut off the communication with\r\nthe main building, by withdrawing the temporary bridge. In the outwork\r\nwas a sallyport corresponding to the postern of the castle, and the\r\nwhole was surrounded by a strong palisade. Rebecca could observe, from\r\nthe number of men placed for the defence of this post, that the\r\nbesieged entertained apprehensions for its safety; and from the\r\nmustering of the assailants in a direction nearly opposite to the\r\noutwork, it seemed no less plain that it had been selected as a\r\nvulnerable point of attack.\r\n\r\nThese appearances she hastily communicated to Ivanhoe, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nskirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are\r\nadvanced from its dark shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder what banner?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder no ensign of war which I can observe,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA singular novelty,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cto advance to storm such a\r\ncastle without pennon or banner displayed!\xe2\x80\x94Seest thou who they be that\r\nact as leaders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJewess; \xe2\x80\x9che alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the\r\ndirection of all around him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat device does he bear on his shield?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the\r\nblack shield.\xe2\x80\x9d 35\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cI know not who may\r\nbear the device, but well I ween it might now be mine own. Canst thou\r\nnot see the motto?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScarce the device itself at this distance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when\r\nthe sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeem there no other leaders?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the anxious enquirer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, doubtless, the other side of the castle is also\r\nassailed. They appear even now preparing to advance\xe2\x80\x94God of Zion,\r\nprotect us!\xe2\x80\x94What a dreadful sight!\xe2\x80\x94Those who advance first bear huge\r\nshields and defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their\r\nbows as they come on.\xe2\x80\x94They raise their bows!\xe2\x80\x94God of Moses, forgive the\r\ncreatures thou hast made!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for\r\nassault, which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once\r\nanswered by a flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements,\r\nwhich, mingled with the deep and hollow clang of the nakers, (a species\r\nof kettle-drum,) retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the\r\nenemy. The shouts of both parties augmented the fearful din, the\r\nassailants crying, \xe2\x80\x9cSaint George for merry England!\xe2\x80\x9d and the Normans\r\nanswering them with loud cries of \xe2\x80\x9cEn avant De Bracy!\xe2\x80\x94Beau-seant!\r\nBeau-seant!\xe2\x80\x94Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf a la rescousse!\xe2\x80\x9d according to the war-cries\r\nof their different commanders.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, by clamour that the contest was to be decided, and\r\nthe desperate efforts of the assailants were met by an equally vigorous\r\ndefence on the part of the besieged. The archers, trained by their\r\nwoodland pastimes to the most effective use of the long-bow, shot, to\r\nuse the appropriate phrase of the time, so \xe2\x80\x9cwholly together,\xe2\x80\x9d that no\r\npoint at which a defender could show the least part of his person,\r\nescaped their cloth-yard shafts. By this heavy discharge, which\r\ncontinued as thick and sharp as hail, while, notwithstanding, every\r\narrow had its individual aim, and flew by scores together against each\r\nembrasure and opening in the parapets, as well as at every window where\r\na defender either occasionally had post, or might be suspected to be\r\nstationed,\xe2\x80\x94by this sustained discharge, two or three of the garrison\r\nwere slain, and several others wounded. But, confident in their armour\r\nof proof, and in the cover which their situation afforded, the\r\nfollowers of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, and his allies, showed an obstinacy in\r\ndefence proportioned to the fury of the attack and replied with the\r\ndischarge of their large cross-bows, as well as with their long-bows,\r\nslings, and other missile weapons, to the close and continued shower of\r\narrows; and, as the assailants were necessarily but indifferently\r\nprotected, did considerably more damage than they received at their\r\nhand. The whizzing of shafts and of missiles, on both sides, was only\r\ninterrupted by the shouts which arose when either side inflicted or\r\nsustained some notable loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must lie here like a bedridden monk,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile\r\nthe game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of\r\nothers!\xe2\x80\x94Look from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that\r\nyou are not marked by the archers beneath\xe2\x80\x94Look out once more, and tell\r\nme if they yet advance to the storm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had\r\nemployed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the lattice,\r\nsheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible from beneath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou see, Rebecca?\xe2\x80\x9d again demanded the wounded knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine\r\neyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot endure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cif they press not right on to\r\ncarry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail but\r\nlittle against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight of the\r\nFetterlock, fair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the\r\nleader is, so will his followers be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFoul craven!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cdoes he blench from the helm when\r\nthe wind blows highest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe blenches not! he blenches not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI see him now; he\r\nleads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican. 36\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers\r\nwith axes.\xe2\x80\x94His high black plume floats abroad over the throng, like a\r\nraven over the field of the slain.\xe2\x80\x94They have made a breach in the\r\nbarriers\xe2\x80\x94they rush in\xe2\x80\x94they are thrust back!\xe2\x80\x94Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf heads the\r\ndefenders; I see his gigantic form above the press. They throng again\r\nto the breach, and the pass is disputed hand to hand, and man to man.\r\nGod of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides\xe2\x80\x94the conflict of two\r\noceans moved by adverse winds!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a\r\nsight so terrible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook forth again, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of her\r\nretiring; \xe2\x80\x9cthe archery must in some degree have ceased, since they are\r\nnow fighting hand to hand.\xe2\x80\x94Look again, there is now less danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHoly\r\nprophets of the law! Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf and the Black Knight fight hand to\r\nhand on the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the\r\nprogress of the strife\xe2\x80\x94Heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed\r\nand of the captive!\xe2\x80\x9d She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nis down!\xe2\x80\x94he is down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is down?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cfor our dear Lady\xe2\x80\x99s sake, tell me which\r\nhas fallen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Black Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again\r\nshouted with joyful eagerness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut no\xe2\x80\x94but no!\xe2\x80\x94the name of the Lord of\r\nHosts be blessed!\xe2\x80\x94he is on foot again, and fights as if there were\r\ntwenty men\xe2\x80\x99s strength in his single arm\xe2\x80\x94His sword is broken\xe2\x80\x94he snatches\r\nan axe from a yeoman\xe2\x80\x94he presses Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf with blow on blow\xe2\x80\x94The\r\ngiant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the woodman\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nfalls\xe2\x80\x94he falls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jewess; \xe2\x80\x9chis men rush to the rescue,\r\nheaded by the haughty Templar\xe2\x80\x94their united force compels the champion\r\nto pause\xe2\x80\x94They drag Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf within the walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe assailants have won the barriers, have they not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have\xe2\x80\x94they have!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand they press the besieged\r\nhard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and\r\nendeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each other\xe2\x80\x94down go stones,\r\nbeams, and trunks of trees upon their heads, and as fast as they bear\r\nthe wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the\r\nassault\xe2\x80\x94Great God! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should\r\nbe thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is no time for such\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94Who yield?\xe2\x80\x94who push their way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ladders are thrown down,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca, shuddering; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsoldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles\xe2\x80\x94The besieged\r\nhave the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaint George strike for us!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the knight; \xe2\x80\x9cdo the false\r\nyeomen give way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthey bear themselves right yeomanly\xe2\x80\x94the Black\r\nKnight approaches the postern with his huge axe\xe2\x80\x94the thundering blows\r\nwhich he deals, you may hear them above all the din and shouts of the\r\nbattle\xe2\x80\x94Stones and beams are hailed down on the bold champion\xe2\x80\x94he regards\r\nthem no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Saint John of Acre,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his\r\ncouch, \xe2\x80\x9cmethought there was but one man in England that might do such a\r\ndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe postern gate shakes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cit crashes\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nsplintered by his blows\xe2\x80\x94they rush in\xe2\x80\x94the outwork is won\xe2\x80\x94Oh, God!\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nhurl the defenders from the battlements\xe2\x80\x94they throw them into the moat\xe2\x80\x94O\r\nmen, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bridge\xe2\x80\x94the bridge which communicates with the castle\xe2\x80\x94have they won\r\nthat pass?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Templar has destroyed the plank on which\r\nthey crossed\xe2\x80\x94few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nshrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the others\xe2\x80\x94Alas!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsee it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they now, maiden?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9clook forth yet again\xe2\x80\x94this is\r\nno time to faint at bloodshed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is over for the time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cour friends strengthen\r\nthemselves within the outwork which they have mastered, and it affords\r\nthem so good a shelter from the foemen\xe2\x80\x99s shot, that the garrison only\r\nbestow a few bolts on it from interval to interval, as if rather to\r\ndisquiet than effectually to injure them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred, \xe2\x80\x9cwill surely not abandon an enterprise so\r\ngloriously begun and so happily attained.\xe2\x80\x94O no! I will put my faith in\r\nthe good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of\r\niron.\xe2\x80\x94Singular,\xe2\x80\x9d he again muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cif there be two who can\r\ndo a deed of such derring-do! 37\xe2\x80\x94a fetterlock, and a shacklebolt on a\r\nfield sable\xe2\x80\x94what may that mean?\xe2\x80\x94seest thou nought else, Rebecca, by\r\nwhich the Black Knight may be distinguished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess; \xe2\x80\x9call about him is black as the wing of the\r\nnight raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further\xe2\x80\x94but having\r\nonce seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I could know\r\nhim again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as if he\r\nwere summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength, there\r\nseems as if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to\r\nevery blow which he deals upon his enemies. God assoilize him of the\r\nsin of bloodshed!\xe2\x80\x94it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm\r\nand heart of one man can triumph over hundreds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast painted a hero; surely they rest\r\nbut to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossing the\r\nmoat\xe2\x80\x94Under such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there\r\nare no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant\r\nemprize; since the difficulties which render it arduous render it also\r\nglorious. I swear by the honour of my house\xe2\x80\x94I vow by the name of my\r\nbright lady-love, I would endure ten years\xe2\x80\x99 captivity to fight one day\r\nby that good knight\xe2\x80\x99s side in such a quarrel as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and\r\napproaching the couch of the wounded knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthis impatient yearning\r\nafter action\xe2\x80\x94this struggling with and repining at your present\r\nweakness, will not fail to injure your returning health\xe2\x80\x94How couldst\r\nthou hope to inflict wounds on others, ere that be healed which thou\r\nthyself hast received?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest not how impossible it is for one\r\ntrained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, or a\r\nwoman, when they are acting deeds of honour around him. The love of\r\nbattle is the food upon which we live\xe2\x80\x94the dust of the \xe2\x80\x98melee\xe2\x80\x99 is the\r\nbreath of our nostrils! We live not\xe2\x80\x94we wish not to live\xe2\x80\x94longer than\r\nwhile we are victorious and renowned\xe2\x80\x94Such, maiden, are the laws of\r\nchivalry to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold\r\ndear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the fair Jewess, \xe2\x80\x9cand what is it, valiant knight, save an\r\noffering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory, and a passing through\r\nthe fire to Moloch?\xe2\x80\x94What remains to you as the prize of all the blood\r\nyou have spilled\xe2\x80\x94of all the travail and pain you have endured\xe2\x80\x94of all\r\nthe tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath broken the\r\nstrong man\xe2\x80\x99s spear, and overtaken the speed of his war-horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat remains?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cGlory, maiden, glory! which gilds our\r\nsepulchre and embalms our name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9calas, is the rusted mail which hangs as a\r\nhatchment over the champion\xe2\x80\x99s dim and mouldering tomb\xe2\x80\x94is the defaced\r\nsculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to\r\nthe enquiring pilgrim\xe2\x80\x94are these sufficient rewards for the sacrifice of\r\nevery kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may make\r\nothers miserable? Or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of a\r\nwandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and\r\nhappiness, are so wildly bartered, to become the hero of those ballads\r\nwhich vagabond minstrels sing to drunken churls over their evening\r\nale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the soul of Hereward!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cthou\r\nspeakest, maiden, of thou knowest not what. Thou wouldst quench the\r\npure light of chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the\r\nbase, the gentle knight from the churl and the savage; which rates our\r\nlife far, far beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious\r\nover pain, toil, and suffering, and teaches us to fear no evil but\r\ndisgrace. Thou art no Christian, Rebecca; and to thee are unknown those\r\nhigh feelings which swell the bosom of a noble maiden when her lover\r\nhath done some deed of emprize which sanctions his flame.\r\nChivalry!\xe2\x80\x94why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the\r\npower of the tyrant\xe2\x80\x94Nobility were but an empty name without her, and\r\nliberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9csprung from a race whose courage was\r\ndistinguished in the defence of their own land, but who warred not,\r\neven while yet a nation, save at the command of the Deity, or in\r\ndefending their country from oppression. The sound of the trumpet wakes\r\nJudah no longer, and her despised children are now but the unresisting\r\nvictims of hostile and military oppression. Well hast thou spoken, Sir\r\nKnight,\xe2\x80\x94until the God of Jacob shall raise up for his chosen people a\r\nsecond Gideon, or a new Maccabeus, it ill beseemeth the Jewish damsel\r\nto speak of battle or of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe high-minded maiden concluded the argument in a tone of sorrow,\r\nwhich deeply expressed her sense of the degradation of her people,\r\nembittered perhaps by the idea that Ivanhoe considered her as one not\r\nentitled to interfere in a case of honour, and incapable of\r\nentertaining or expressing sentiments of honour and generosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow little he knows this bosom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto imagine that cowardice\r\nor meanness of soul must needs be its guests, because I have censured\r\nthe fantastic chivalry of the Nazarenes! Would to heaven that the\r\nshedding of mine own blood, drop by drop, could redeem the captivity of\r\nJudah! Nay, would to God it could avail to set free my father, and this\r\nhis benefactor, from the chains of the oppressor! The proud Christian\r\nshould then see whether the daughter of God\xe2\x80\x99s chosen people dared not\r\nto die as bravely as the vainest Nazarene maiden, that boasts her\r\ndescent from some petty chieftain of the rude and frozen north!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then looked towards the couch of the wounded knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sleeps,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cnature exhausted by sufferance and the waste of\r\nspirits, his wearied frame embraces the first moment of temporary\r\nrelaxation to sink into slumber. Alas! is it a crime that I should look\r\nupon him, when it may be for the last time?\xe2\x80\x94When yet but a short space,\r\nand those fair features will be no longer animated by the bold and\r\nbuoyant spirit which forsakes them not even in sleep!\xe2\x80\x94When the nostril\r\nshall be distended, the mouth agape, the eyes fixed and bloodshot; and\r\nwhen the proud and noble knight may be trodden on by the lowest caitiff\r\nof this accursed castle, yet stir not when the heel is lifted up\r\nagainst him!\xe2\x80\x94And my father!\xe2\x80\x94oh, my father! evil is it with his\r\ndaughter, when his grey hairs are not remembered because of the golden\r\nlocks of youth!\xe2\x80\x94What know I but that these evils are the messengers of\r\nJehovah\xe2\x80\x99s wrath to the unnatural child, who thinks of a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncaptivity before a parent\xe2\x80\x99s? who forgets the desolation of Judah, and\r\nlooks upon the comeliness of a Gentile and a stranger?\xe2\x80\x94But I will tear\r\nthis folly from my heart, though every fibre bleed as I rend it away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrapped herself closely in her veil, and sat down at a distance\r\nfrom the couch of the wounded knight, with her back turned towards it,\r\nfortifying, or endeavouring to fortify her mind, not only against the\r\nimpending evils from without, but also against those treacherous\r\nfeelings which assailed her from within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach the chamber, look upon his bed.\r\nHis is the passing of no peaceful ghost,\r\nWhich, as the lark arises to the sky,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Mid morning\xe2\x80\x99s sweetest breeze and softest dew,\r\nIs wing\xe2\x80\x99d to heaven by good men\xe2\x80\x99s sighs and tears!\xe2\x80\x94\r\nAnselm parts otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the interval of quiet which followed the first success of the\r\nbesiegers, while the one party was preparing to pursue their advantage,\r\nand the other to strengthen their means of defence, the Templar and De\r\nBracy held brief council together in the hall of the castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf?\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter, who had superintended the\r\ndefence of the fortress on the other side; \xe2\x80\x9cmen say he hath been\r\nslain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9clives as yet; but had he worn\r\nthe bull\xe2\x80\x99s head of which he bears the name, and ten plates of iron to\r\nfence it withal, he must have gone down before yonder fatal axe. Yet a\r\nfew hours, and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf is with his fathers\xe2\x80\x94a powerful limb lopped\r\noff Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a brave addition to the kingdom of Satan,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\ncomes of reviling saints and angels, and ordering images of holy things\r\nand holy men to be flung down on the heads of these rascaille yeomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to\xe2\x80\x94thou art a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cthy superstition is upon a\r\nlevel with Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s want of faith; neither of you can render a\r\nreason for your belief or unbelief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBenedicite, Sir Templar,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cpray you to keep better\r\nrule with your tongue when I am the theme of it. By the Mother of\r\nHeaven, I am a better Christian man than thou and thy fellowship; for\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98bruit\xe2\x80\x99 goeth shrewdly out, that the most holy Order of the Temple\r\nof Zion nurseth not a few heretics within its bosom, and that Sir Brian\r\nde Bois-Guilbert is of the number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCare not thou for such reports,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us think\r\nof making good the castle.\xe2\x80\x94How fought these villain yeomen on thy\r\nside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike fiends incarnate,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy. \xe2\x80\x9cThey swarmed close up to the\r\nwalls, headed, as I think, by the knave who won the prize at the\r\narchery, for I knew his horn and baldric. And this is old Fitzurse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboasted policy, encouraging these malapert knaves to rebel against us!\r\nHad I not been armed in proof, the villain had marked me down seven\r\ntimes with as little remorse as if I had been a buck in season. He told\r\nevery rivet on my armour with a cloth-yard shaft, that rapped against\r\nmy ribs with as little compunction as if my bones had been of iron\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nthat I wore a shirt of Spanish mail under my plate-coat, I had been\r\nfairly sped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you maintained your post?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lost the outwork\r\non our part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a shrewd loss,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cthe knaves will find cover\r\nthere to assault the castle more closely, and may, if not well watched,\r\ngain some unguarded corner of a tower, or some forgotten window, and so\r\nbreak in upon us. Our numbers are too few for the defence of every\r\npoint, and the men complain that they can nowhere show themselves, but\r\nthey are the mark for as many arrows as a parish-butt on a holyday\r\neven. Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf is dying too, so we shall receive no more aid from\r\nhis bull\xe2\x80\x99s head and brutal strength. How think you, Sir Brian, were we\r\nnot better make a virtue of necessity, and compound with the rogues by\r\ndelivering up our prisoners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver up our prisoners, and stand an\r\nobject alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughty warriors who\r\ndared by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party\r\nof defenceless travellers, yet could not make good a strong castle\r\nagainst a vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and\r\nthe very refuse of mankind?\xe2\x80\x94Shame on thy counsel, Maurice de Bracy!\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nruins of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere I\r\nconsent to such base and dishonourable composition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us to the walls, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, carelessly; \xe2\x80\x9cthat man never\r\nbreathed, be he Turk or Templar, who held life at lighter rate than I\r\ndo. But I trust there is no dishonour in wishing I had here some two\r\nscores of my gallant troop of Free Companions?\xe2\x80\x94Oh, my brave lances! if\r\nye knew but how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should\r\nI see my banner at the head of your clump of spears! And how short\r\nwhile would these rabble villains stand to endure your encounter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish for whom thou wilt,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cbut let us make what\r\ndefence we can with the soldiers who remain\xe2\x80\x94They are chiefly\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s followers, hated by the English for a thousand acts of\r\ninsolence and oppression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cthe rugged slaves will defend themselves\r\nto the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter the revenge of the\r\npeasants without. Let us up and be doing, then, Brian de Bois-Guilbert;\r\nand, live or die, thou shalt see Maurice de Bracy bear himself this day\r\nas a gentleman of blood and lineage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the walls!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; and they both ascended the\r\nbattlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhood accomplish,\r\nin defence of the place. They readily agreed that the point of greatest\r\ndanger was that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had\r\npossessed themselves. The castle, indeed, was divided from that\r\nbarbican by the moat, and it was impossible that the besiegers could\r\nassail the postern-door, with which the outwork corresponded, without\r\nsurmounting that obstacle; but it was the opinion both of the Templar\r\nand De Bracy, that the besiegers, if governed by the same policy their\r\nleader had already displayed, would endeavour, by a formidable assault,\r\nto draw the chief part of the defenders\xe2\x80\x99 observation to this point, and\r\ntake measures to avail themselves of every negligence which might take\r\nplace in the defence elsewhere. To guard against such an evil, their\r\nnumbers only permitted the knights to place sentinels from space to\r\nspace along the walls in communication with each other, who might give\r\nthe alarm whenever danger was threatened. Meanwhile, they agreed that\r\nDe Bracy should command the defence at the postern, and the Templar\r\nshould keep with him a score of men or thereabouts as a body of\r\nreserve, ready to hasten to any other point which might be suddenly\r\nthreatened. The loss of the barbican had also this unfortunate effect,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the superior height of the castle walls, the\r\nbesieged could not see from them, with the same precision as before,\r\nthe operations of the enemy; for some straggling underwood approached\r\nso near the sallyport of the outwork, that the assailants might\r\nintroduce into it whatever force they thought proper, not only under\r\ncover, but even without the knowledge of the defenders. Utterly\r\nuncertain, therefore, upon what point the storm was to burst, De Bracy\r\nand his companion were under the necessity of providing against every\r\npossible contingency, and their followers, however brave, experienced\r\nthe anxious dejection of mind incident to men enclosed by enemies, who\r\npossessed the power of choosing their time and mode of attack.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the lord of the beleaguered and endangered castle lay upon a\r\nbed of bodily pain and mental agony. He had not the usual resource of\r\nbigots in that superstitious period, most of whom were wont to atone\r\nfor the crimes they were guilty of by liberality to the church,\r\nstupefying by this means their terrors by the idea of atonement and\r\nforgiveness; and although the refuge which success thus purchased, was\r\nno more like to the peace of mind which follows on sincere repentance,\r\nthan the turbid stupefaction procured by opium resembles healthy and\r\nnatural slumbers, it was still a state of mind preferable to the\r\nagonies of awakened remorse. But among the vices of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, a\r\nhard and griping man, avarice was predominant; and he preferred setting\r\nchurch and churchmen at defiance, to purchasing from them pardon and\r\nabsolution at the price of treasure and of manors. Nor did the Templar,\r\nan infidel of another stamp, justly characterise his associate, when he\r\nsaid Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf could assign no cause for his unbelief and contempt\r\nfor the established faith; for the Baron would have alleged that the\r\nChurch sold her wares too dear, that the spiritual freedom which she\r\nput up to sale was only to be bought like that of the chief captain of\r\nJerusalem, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a great sum,\xe2\x80\x9d and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf preferred denying the\r\nvirtue of the medicine, to paying the expense of the physician.\r\n\r\nBut the moment had now arrived when earth and all his treasures were\r\ngliding from before his eyes, and when the savage Baron\xe2\x80\x99s heart, though\r\nhard as a nether millstone, became appalled as he gazed forward into\r\nthe waste darkness of futurity. The fever of his body aided the\r\nimpatience and agony of his mind, and his death-bed exhibited a mixture\r\nof the newly awakened feelings of horror, combating with the fixed and\r\ninveterate obstinacy of his disposition;\xe2\x80\x94a fearful state of mind, only\r\nto be equalled in those tremendous regions, where there are complaints\r\nwithout hope, remorse without repentance, a dreadful sense of present\r\nagony, and a presentiment that it cannot cease or be diminished!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere be these dog-priests now,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the Baron, \xe2\x80\x9cwho set such\r\nprice on their ghostly mummery?\xe2\x80\x94where be all those unshod Carmelites,\r\nfor whom old Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf founded the convent of St Anne, robbing his\r\nheir of many a fair rood of meadow, and many a fat field and\r\nclose\xe2\x80\x94where be the greedy hounds now?\xe2\x80\x94Swilling, I warrant me, at the\r\nale, or playing their juggling tricks at the bedside of some miserly\r\nchurl.\xe2\x80\x94Me, the heir of their founder\xe2\x80\x94me, whom their foundation binds\r\nthem to pray for\xe2\x80\x94me\xe2\x80\x94ungrateful villains as they are!\xe2\x80\x94they suffer to die\r\nlike the houseless dog on yonder common, unshriven and unhouseled!\xe2\x80\x94Tell\r\nthe Templar to come hither\xe2\x80\x94he is a priest, and may do something\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nno!\xe2\x80\x94as well confess myself to the devil as to Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\r\nwho recks neither of heaven nor of hell.\xe2\x80\x94I have heard old men talk of\r\nprayer\xe2\x80\x94prayer by their own voice\xe2\x80\x94Such need not to court or to bribe the\r\nfalse priest\xe2\x80\x94But I\xe2\x80\x94I dare not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLives Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d said a broken and shrill voice close by\r\nhis bedside, \xe2\x80\x9cto say there is that which he dares not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe evil conscience and the shaken nerves of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf heard, in\r\nthis strange interruption to his soliloquy, the voice of one of those\r\ndemons, who, as the superstition of the times believed, beset the beds\r\nof dying men to distract their thoughts, and turn them from the\r\nmeditations which concerned their eternal welfare. He shuddered and\r\ndrew himself together; but, instantly summoning up his wonted\r\nresolution, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x94what art thou, that darest to\r\necho my words in a tone like that of the night-raven?\xe2\x80\x94Come before my\r\ncouch that I may see thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thine evil angel, Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me behold thee then in thy bodily shape, if thou be\xe2\x80\x99st indeed a\r\nfiend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the dying knight; \xe2\x80\x9cthink not that I will blench from\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x94By the eternal dungeon, could I but grapple with these horrors\r\nthat hover round me, as I have done with mortal dangers, heaven or hell\r\nshould never say that I shrunk from the conflict!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink on thy sins, Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d said the almost unearthly\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9con rebellion, on rapine, on murder!\xe2\x80\x94Who stirred up the\r\nlicentious John to war against his grey-headed father\xe2\x80\x94against his\r\ngenerous brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe thou fiend, priest, or devil,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, \xe2\x80\x9cthou liest\r\nin thy throat!\xe2\x80\x94Not I stirred John to rebellion\xe2\x80\x94not I alone\xe2\x80\x94there were\r\nfifty knights and barons, the flower of the midland counties\xe2\x80\x94better men\r\nnever laid lance in rest\xe2\x80\x94And must I answer for the fault done by\r\nfifty?\xe2\x80\x94False fiend, I defy thee! Depart, and haunt my couch no more\xe2\x80\x94let\r\nme die in peace if thou be mortal\xe2\x80\x94if thou be a demon, thy time is not\r\nyet come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn peace thou shalt NOT die,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the voice; \xe2\x80\x9ceven in death shalt\r\nthou think on thy murders\xe2\x80\x94on the groans which this castle has echoed\xe2\x80\x94on\r\nthe blood that is engrained in its floors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou canst not shake me by thy petty malice,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\r\nwith a ghastly and constrained laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe infidel Jew\xe2\x80\x94it was merit\r\nwith heaven to deal with him as I did, else wherefore are men canonized\r\nwho dip their hands in the blood of Saracens?\xe2\x80\x94The Saxon porkers, whom I\r\nhave slain, they were the foes of my country, and of my lineage, and of\r\nmy liege lord.\xe2\x80\x94Ho! ho! thou seest there is no crevice in my coat of\r\nplate\xe2\x80\x94Art thou fled?\xe2\x80\x94art thou silenced?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, foul parricide!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice; \xe2\x80\x9cthink of thy father!\xe2\x80\x94think of\r\nhis death!\xe2\x80\x94think of his banquet-room flooded with his gore, and that\r\npoured forth by the hand of a son!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Baron, after a long pause, \xe2\x80\x9can thou knowest that,\r\nthou art indeed the author of evil, and as omniscient as the monks call\r\nthee!\xe2\x80\x94That secret I deemed locked in my own breast, and in that of one\r\nbesides\xe2\x80\x94the temptress, the partaker of my guilt.\xe2\x80\x94Go, leave me, fiend!\r\nand seek the Saxon witch Ulrica, who alone could tell thee what she and\r\nI alone witnessed.\xe2\x80\x94Go, I say, to her, who washed the wounds, and\r\nstraighted the corpse, and gave to the slain man the outward show of\r\none parted in time and in the course of nature\xe2\x80\x94Go to her, she was my\r\ntemptress, the foul provoker, the more foul rewarder, of the deed\xe2\x80\x94let\r\nher, as well as I, taste of the tortures which anticipate hell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe already tastes them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ulrica, stepping before the couch of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cshe hath long drunken of this cup, and its bitterness\r\nis now sweetened to see that thou dost partake it.\xe2\x80\x94Grind not thy teeth,\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x94roll not thine eyes\xe2\x80\x94clench not thine hand, nor shake it\r\nat me with that gesture of menace!\xe2\x80\x94The hand which, like that of thy\r\nrenowned ancestor who gained thy name, could have broken with one\r\nstroke the skull of a mountain-bull, is now unnerved and powerless as\r\nmine own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVile murderous hag!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf; \xe2\x80\x9cdetestable screech-owl!\r\nit is then thou who art come to exult over the ruins thou hast assisted\r\nto lay low?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Reginald Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf,\xe2\x80\x9d answered she, \xe2\x80\x9cit is Ulrica!\xe2\x80\x94it is the\r\ndaughter of the murdered Torquil Wolfganger!\xe2\x80\x94it is the sister of his\r\nslaughtered sons!\xe2\x80\x94it is she who demands of thee, and of thy father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, father and kindred, name and fame\xe2\x80\x94all that she has lost by the\r\nname of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf!\xe2\x80\x94Think of my wrongs, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, and answer me\r\nif I speak not truth.

And by mine honour, when we kindle the blazing beacon, for\r\njoy of our defence, it shall consume thee, body and bones; and I shall\r\nlive to hear thou art gone from earthly fires to those of that hell,\r\nwhich never sent forth an incarnate fiend more utterly diabolical!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold thy belief,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ulrica, \xe2\x80\x9ctill the proof reach thee\xe2\x80\x94But, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, interrupting herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt know, even now, the doom,\r\nwhich all thy power, strength, and courage, is unable to avoid, though\r\nit is prepared for thee by this feeble band. Markest thou the\r\nsmouldering and suffocating vapour which already eddies in sable folds\r\nthrough the chamber?\xe2\x80\x94Didst thou think it was but the darkening of thy\r\nbursting eyes\xe2\x80\x94the difficulty of thy cumbered breathing?\xe2\x80\x94No!\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf, there is another cause\xe2\x80\x94Rememberest thou the magazine of\r\nfuel that is stored beneath these apartments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoman!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed with fury, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast not set fire to it?\xe2\x80\x94By\r\nheaven, thou hast, and the castle is in flames!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are fast rising at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ulrica, with frightful composure;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon\r\nthose who would extinguish them.\xe2\x80\x94Farewell, Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf!\xe2\x80\x94May Mista,\r\nSkogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancient Saxons\xe2\x80\x94fiends, as the\r\npriests now call them\xe2\x80\x94supply the place of comforters at your dying bed,\r\nwhich Ulrica now relinquishes!\xe2\x80\x94But know, if it will give thee comfort\r\nto know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark coast with thyself,\r\nthe companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy guilt.\xe2\x80\x94And now,\r\nparricide, farewell for ever!\xe2\x80\x94May each stone of this vaulted roof find\r\na tongue to echo that title into thine ear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she left the apartment; and Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf could hear the\r\ncrash of the ponderous key, as she locked and double-locked the door\r\nbehind her, thus cutting off the most slender chance of escape. In the\r\nextremity of agony he shouted upon his servants and allies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cStephen and\r\nSaint Maur!\xe2\x80\x94Clement and Giles!\xe2\x80\x94I burn here unaided!\xe2\x80\x94To the rescue\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nthe rescue, brave Bois-Guilbert, valiant De Bracy!\xe2\x80\x94It is Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\r\nwho calls!\xe2\x80\x94It is your master, ye traitor squires!\xe2\x80\x94Your ally\xe2\x80\x94your\r\nbrother in arms, ye perjured and faithless knights!\xe2\x80\x94all the curses due\r\nto traitors upon your recreant heads, do you abandon me to perish thus\r\nmiserably!\xe2\x80\x94They hear me not\xe2\x80\x94they cannot hear me\xe2\x80\x94my voice is lost in the\r\ndin of battle.\xe2\x80\x94The smoke rolls thicker and thicker\xe2\x80\x94the fire has caught\r\nupon the floor below\xe2\x80\x94O, for one drought of the air of heaven, were it\r\nto be purchased by instant annihilation!\xe2\x80\x9d And in the mad frenzy of\r\ndespair, the wretch now shouted with the shouts of the fighters, now\r\nmuttered curses on himself, on mankind, and on Heaven itself.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe red\r\nfire flashes through the thick smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cthe demon marches\r\nagainst me under the banner of his own element\xe2\x80\x94Foul spirit, avoid!\xe2\x80\x94I go\r\nnot with thee without my comrades\xe2\x80\x94all, all are thine, that garrison\r\nthese walls\xe2\x80\x94Thinkest thou Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf will be singled out to go\r\nalone?\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94the infidel Templar\xe2\x80\x94the licentious De Bracy\xe2\x80\x94Ulrica, the foul\r\nmurdering strumpet\xe2\x80\x94the men who aided my enterprises\xe2\x80\x94the dog Saxons and\r\naccursed Jews, who are my prisoners\xe2\x80\x94all, all shall attend me\xe2\x80\x94a goodly\r\nfellowship as ever took the downward road\xe2\x80\x94Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d and he laughed\r\nin his frenzy till the vaulted roof rang again. \xe2\x80\x9cWho laughed there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, in altered mood, for the noise of the conflict\r\ndid not prevent the echoes of his own mad laughter from returning upon\r\nhis ear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwho laughed there?\xe2\x80\x94Ulrica, was it thou?\xe2\x80\x94Speak, witch, and I\r\nforgive thee\xe2\x80\x94for, only thou or the fiend of hell himself could have\r\nlaughed at such a moment.

They were\r\nwell pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in\r\nthe moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily\r\nagreed with the Saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought\r\nto be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in\r\nthe hands of the cruel Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe royal blood of Alfred is endangered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe honour of a noble lady is in peril,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, by the Saint Christopher at my baldric,\xe2\x80\x9d said the good yeoman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwere there no other cause than the safety of that poor faithful knave,\r\nWamba, I would jeopard a joint ere a hair of his head were hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so would I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat, sirs! I trust well that a\r\nfool\xe2\x80\x94I mean, d\xe2\x80\x99ye see me, sirs, a fool that is free of his guild and\r\nmaster of his craft, and can give as much relish and flavour to a cup\r\nof wine as ever a flitch of bacon can\xe2\x80\x94I say, brethren, such a fool\r\nshall never want a wise clerk to pray for or fight for him at a strait,\r\nwhile I can say a mass or flourish a partisan.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he made\r\nhis heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes\r\nhis light crook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Holy Clerk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9ctrue as if Saint Dunstan\r\nhimself had said it.\xe2\x80\x94And now, good Locksley, were it not well that\r\nnoble Cedric should assume the direction of this assault?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a jot I,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cI have never been wont to study either\r\nhow to take or how to hold out those abodes of tyrannic power, which\r\nthe Normans have erected in this groaning land. I will fight among the\r\nforemost; but my honest neighbours well know I am not a trained soldier\r\nin the discipline of wars, or the attack of strongholds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince it stands thus with noble Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cI am most\r\nwilling to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang\r\nme up on my own Trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show\r\nthemselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as\r\nthere are cloves in a gammon of bacon at Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said, stout yeoman,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Black Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I be\r\nthought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among\r\nthese brave men as many as are willing to follow a true English knight,\r\nfor so I may surely call myself, I am ready, with such skill as my\r\nexperience has taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the\r\nfirst assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.\r\n\r\nWhen the barbican was carried, the Sable Knight sent notice of the\r\nhappy event to Locksley, requesting him at the same time, to keep such\r\na strict observation on the castle as might prevent the defenders from\r\ncombining their force for a sudden sally, and recovering the outwork\r\nwhich they had lost. This the knight was chiefly desirous of avoiding,\r\nconscious that the men whom he led, being hasty and untrained\r\nvolunteers, imperfectly armed and unaccustomed to discipline, must,\r\nupon any sudden attack, fight at great disadvantage with the veteran\r\nsoldiers of the Norman knights, who were well provided with arms both\r\ndefensive and offensive; and who, to match the zeal and high spirit of\r\nthe besiegers, had all the confidence which arises from perfect\r\ndiscipline and the habitual use of weapons.\r\n\r\nThe knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of\r\nfloating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the\r\nmoat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. This was a work of some\r\ntime, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave Ulrica leisure\r\nto execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nWhen the raft was completed, the Black Knight addressed the\r\nbesiegers:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is\r\ndescending to the west\xe2\x80\x94and I have that upon my hands which will not\r\npermit me to tarry with you another day. Besides, it will be a marvel\r\nif the horsemen come not upon us from York, unless we speedily\r\naccomplish our purpose. Wherefore, one of ye go to Locksley, and bid\r\nhim commence a discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle,\r\nand move forward as if about to assault it; and you, true English\r\nhearts, stand by me, and be ready to thrust the raft endlong over the\r\nmoat whenever the postern on our side is thrown open. Follow me boldly\r\nacross, and aid me to burst yon sallyport in the main wall of the\r\ncastle. As many of you as like not this service, or are but ill armed\r\nto meet it, do you man the top of the outwork, draw your bow-strings to\r\nyour ears, and mind you quell with your shot whatever shall appear to\r\nman the rampart\xe2\x80\x94Noble Cedric, wilt thou take the direction of those\r\nwhich remain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, by the soul of Hereward!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Saxon; \xe2\x80\x9clead I cannot; but\r\nmay posterity curse me in my grave, if I follow not with the foremost\r\nwherever thou shalt point the way\xe2\x80\x94The quarrel is mine, and well it\r\nbecomes me to be in the van of the battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet, bethink thee, noble Saxon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast neither\r\nhauberk, nor corslet, nor aught but that light helmet, target, and\r\nsword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be the lighter to climb these\r\nwalls. And,\xe2\x80\x94forgive the boast, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x94thou shalt this day see the\r\nnaked breast of a Saxon as boldly presented to the battle as ever ye\r\nbeheld the steel corslet of a Norman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cfling open the door, and\r\nlaunch the floating bridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat,\r\nand which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle,\r\nwas now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward,\r\nand soon flashed in the waters, extending its length between the castle\r\nand outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men\r\nabreast to cross the moat. Well aware of the importance of taking the\r\nfoe by surprise, the Black Knight, closely followed by Cedric, threw\r\nhimself upon the bridge, and reached the opposite side. Here he began\r\nto thunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part\r\nfrom the shot and stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the\r\nformer drawbridge, which the Templar had demolished in his retreat from\r\nthe barbican, leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part\r\nof the portal. The followers of the knight had no such shelter; two\r\nwere instantly shot with cross-bow bolts, and two more fell into the\r\nmoat; the others retreated back into the barbican.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Cedric and of the Black Knight was now truly\r\ndangerous, and would have been still more so, but for the constancy of\r\nthe archers in the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon\r\nthe battlements, distracting the attention of those by whom they were\r\nmanned, and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the storm\r\nof missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmed them. But their\r\nsituation was eminently perilous, and was becoming more so with every\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame on ye all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried De Bracy to the soldiers around him; \xe2\x80\x9cdo ye\r\ncall yourselves cross-bowmen, and let these two dogs keep their station\r\nunder the walls of the castle?\xe2\x80\x94Heave over the coping stones from the\r\nbattlements, an better may not be\xe2\x80\x94Get pick-axe and levers, and down\r\nwith that huge pinnacle!\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to a heavy piece of stone\r\ncarved-work that projected from the parapet.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the besiegers caught sight of the red flag upon the\r\nangle of the tower which Ulrica had described to Cedric. The stout\r\nyeoman Locksley was the first who was aware of it, as he was hasting to\r\nthe outwork, impatient to see the progress of the assault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaint George!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Saint George for England!\xe2\x80\x94To the\r\ncharge, bold yeomen!\xe2\x80\x94why leave ye the good knight and noble Cedric to\r\nstorm the pass alone?\xe2\x80\x94make in, mad priest, show thou canst fight for\r\nthy rosary,\xe2\x80\x94make in, brave yeomen!\xe2\x80\x94the castle is ours, we have friends\r\nwithin\xe2\x80\x94See yonder flag, it is the appointed signal\xe2\x80\x94Torquilstone is\r\nours!\xe2\x80\x94Think of honour, think of spoil\xe2\x80\x94One effort, and the place is\r\nours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the\r\nbreast of one of the men-at-arms, who, under De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s direction, was\r\nloosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the\r\nheads of Cedric and the Black Knight. A second soldier caught from the\r\nhands of the dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and had\r\nloosened the stone pinnacle, when, receiving an arrow through his\r\nhead-piece, he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man.\r\nThe men-at-arms were daunted, for no armour seemed proof against the\r\nshot of this tremendous archer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you give ground, base knaves!\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mount joye Saint\r\nDennis!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Give me the lever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, snatching it up, he again assailed the loosened pinnacle, which\r\nwas of weight enough, if thrown down, not only to have destroyed the\r\nremnant of the drawbridge, which sheltered the two foremost assailants,\r\nbut also to have sunk the rude float of planks over which they had\r\ncrossed. All saw the danger, and the boldest, even the stout Friar\r\nhimself, avoided setting foot on the raft. Thrice did Locksley bend his\r\nshaft against De Bracy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the\r\nknight\xe2\x80\x99s armour of proof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse on thy Spanish steel-coat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9chad English smith\r\nforged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or\r\nsendal.\xe2\x80\x9d He then began to call out, \xe2\x80\x9cComrades! friends! noble Cedric!\r\nbear back, and let the ruin fall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself\r\noccasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty\r\nwar-trumpets. The faithful Gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked\r\nbridge, to warn Cedric of his impending fate, or to share it with him.\r\nBut his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already\r\ntottered, and De Bracy, who still heaved at his task, would have\r\naccomplished it, had not the voice of the Templar sounded close in his\r\nears:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is lost, De Bracy, the castle burns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art mad to say so!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all in a light flame on the western side. I have striven in vain\r\nto extinguish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the stern coolness which formed the basis of his character, Brian\r\nde Bois-Guilbert communicated this hideous intelligence, which was not\r\nso calmly received by his astonished comrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaints of Paradise!\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is to be done? I vow to\r\nSaint Nicholas of Limoges a candlestick of pure gold\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare thy vow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cand mark me. Lead thy men down, as\r\nif to a sally; throw the postern-gate open\xe2\x80\x94There are but two men who\r\noccupy the float, fling them into the moat, and push across for the\r\nbarbican. I will charge from the main gate, and attack the barbican on\r\nthe outside; and if we can regain that post, be assured we shall defend\r\nourselves until we are relieved, or at least till they grant us fair\r\nquarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well thought upon,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI will play my part\xe2\x80\x94Templar,\r\nthou wilt not fail me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand and glove, I will not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert. \xe2\x80\x9cBut haste thee, in\r\nthe name of God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the\r\npostern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. But scarce\r\nwas this done ere the portentous strength of the Black Knight forced\r\nhis way inward in despite of De Bracy and his followers. Two of the\r\nforemost instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all\r\ntheir leader\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to stop them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDogs!\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwill ye let TWO men win our only pass for\r\nsafety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the\r\nblows of their sable antagonist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he be the devil,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you fly from him\r\ninto the mouth of hell?\xe2\x80\x94the castle burns behind us, villains!\xe2\x80\x94let\r\ndespair give you courage, or let me forward! I will cope with this\r\nchampion myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd well and chivalrous did De Bracy that day maintain the fame he had\r\nacquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. The vaulted passage\r\nto which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted\r\nchampions were now fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows\r\nwhich they dealt each other, De Bracy with his sword, the Black Knight\r\nwith his ponderous axe. At length the Norman received a blow, which,\r\nthough its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never\r\nmore would De Bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such\r\nviolence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYield thee, De Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Champion, stooping over him, and\r\nholding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the\r\nknights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of\r\nmercy,)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyield thee, Maurice de Bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou art\r\nbut a dead man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not yield,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy faintly, \xe2\x80\x9cto an unknown conqueror.\r\nTell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me\xe2\x80\x94it shall never be said\r\nthat Maurice de Bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Black Knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nNorman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one\r\nof deep though sullen submission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the barbican,\xe2\x80\x9d said the victor, in a tone of authority, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthere wait my further orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet first, let me say,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it imports thee to know.\r\nWilfred of Ivanhoe is wounded and a prisoner, and will perish in the\r\nburning castle without present help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilfred of Ivanhoe!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Black Knight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cprisoner, and\r\nperish!\xe2\x80\x94The life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair\r\nof his head be singed\xe2\x80\x94Show me his chamber!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAscend yonder winding stair,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cit leads to his\r\napartment\xe2\x80\x94Wilt thou not accept my guidance?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, in a submissive\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. To the barbican, and there wait my orders. I trust thee not, De\r\nBracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this combat and the brief conversation which ensued, Cedric, at\r\nthe head of a body of men, among whom the Friar was conspicuous, had\r\npushed across the bridge as soon as they saw the postern open, and\r\ndrove back the dispirited and despairing followers of De Bracy, of whom\r\nsome asked quarter, some offered vain resistance, and the greater part\r\nfled towards the court-yard. De Bracy himself arose from the ground,\r\nand cast a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. \xe2\x80\x9cHe trusts me not!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nrepeated; \xe2\x80\x9cbut have I deserved his trust?\xe2\x80\x9d He then lifted his sword\r\nfrom the floor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going\r\nto the barbican, gave up his sword to Locksley, whom he met by the way.\r\n\r\nAs the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the\r\nchamber, where Ivanhoe was watched and tended by the Jewess Rebecca. He\r\nhad been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle;\r\nand his attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself\r\nat the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was\r\nfor some time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the\r\nsmouldering and stifling vapour. At length the volumes of smoke which\r\nrolled into the apartment\xe2\x80\x94the cries for water, which were heard even\r\nabove the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this\r\nnew danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe castle burns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cit burns!\xe2\x80\x94What can we do to save\r\nourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFly, Rebecca, and save thine own life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cfor no human\r\naid can avail me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not fly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will be saved or perish\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94And yet, great God!\xe2\x80\x94my father, my father\xe2\x80\x94what will be his\r\nfate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the Templar\r\npresented himself,\xe2\x80\x94a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was broken\r\nand bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his\r\ncasque. \xe2\x80\x9cI have found thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt prove I\r\nwill keep my word to share weal and woe with thee\xe2\x80\x94There is but one path\r\nto safety, I have cut my way through fifty dangers to point it to\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94up, and instantly follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d 38\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not follow thee. If thou wert born\r\nof woman\xe2\x80\x94if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee\xe2\x80\x94if thy heart\r\nbe not hard as thy breastplate\xe2\x80\x94save my aged father\xe2\x80\x94save this wounded\r\nknight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar, with his characteristic calmness, \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nknight, Rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the\r\nshape of sword or flame\xe2\x80\x94and who recks how or where a Jew meets with\r\nhis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSavage warrior,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9crather will I perish in the flames\r\nthan accept safety from thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not choose, Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94once didst thou foil me, but never\r\nmortal did so twice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with\r\nher shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her\r\ncries, and without regarding the menaces and defiance which Ivanhoe\r\nthundered against him. \xe2\x80\x9cHound of the Temple\xe2\x80\x94stain to thine Order\xe2\x80\x94set\r\nfree the damsel! Traitor of Bois-Guilbert, it is Ivanhoe commands\r\nthee!\xe2\x80\x94Villain, I will have thy heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not found thee, Wilfred,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, who at that\r\ninstant entered the apartment, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for thy shouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thou be\xe2\x80\x99st true knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred, \xe2\x80\x9cthink not of me\xe2\x80\x94pursue yon\r\nravisher\xe2\x80\x94save the Lady Rowena\xe2\x80\x94look to the noble Cedric!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn their turn,\xe2\x80\x9d answered he of the Fetterlock, \xe2\x80\x9cbut thine is first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd seizing upon Ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the\r\nTemplar had carried off Rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and\r\nhaving there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again\r\nentered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners.\r\n\r\nOne turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from\r\nwindow and shot-hole. But in other parts, the great thickness of the\r\nwalls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress of\r\nthe flames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce\r\nmore dreadful element held mastery elsewhere; for the besiegers pursued\r\nthe defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber, and satiated in\r\ntheir blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the\r\nsoldiers of the tyrant Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf. Most of the garrison resisted to\r\nthe uttermost\xe2\x80\x94few of them asked quarter\xe2\x80\x94none received it. The air was\r\nfilled with groans and clashing of arms\xe2\x80\x94the floors were slippery with\r\nthe blood of despairing and expiring wretches.\r\n\r\nThrough this scene of confusion, Cedric rushed in quest of Rowena,\r\nwhile the faithful Gurth, following him closely through the \xe2\x80\x9cmelee\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nneglected his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were\r\naimed at his master. The noble Saxon was so fortunate as to reach his\r\nward\xe2\x80\x99s apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and,\r\nwith a crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of\r\ninstant death. He committed her to the charge of Gurth, to be conducted\r\nin safety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the\r\nenemy, and not yet interrupted by the flames. This accomplished, the\r\nloyal Cedric hastened in quest of his friend Athelstane, determined, at\r\nevery risk to himself, to save that last scion of Saxon royalty. But\r\nere Cedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself\r\nbeen a prisoner, the inventive genius of Wamba had procured liberation\r\nfor himself and his companion in adversity.\r\n\r\nWhen the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest,\r\nthe Jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, \xe2\x80\x9cSaint\r\nGeorge and the dragon!\xe2\x80\x94Bonny Saint George for merry England!\xe2\x80\x94The castle\r\nis won!\xe2\x80\x9d And these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging\r\nagainst each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay\r\nscattered around the hall.\r\n\r\nA guard, which had been stationed in the outer, or anteroom, and whose\r\nspirits were already in a state of alarm, took fright at Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclamour, and, leaving the door open behind them, ran to tell the\r\nTemplar that foemen had entered the old hall. Meantime the prisoners\r\nfound no difficulty in making their escape into the anteroom, and from\r\nthence into the court of the castle, which was now the last scene of\r\ncontest. Here sat the fierce Templar, mounted on horseback, surrounded\r\nby several of the garrison both on horse and foot, who had united their\r\nstrength to that of this renowned leader, in order to secure the last\r\nchance of safety and retreat which remained to them. The drawbridge had\r\nbeen lowered by his orders, but the passage was beset; for the archers,\r\nwho had hitherto only annoyed the castle on that side by their\r\nmissiles, no sooner saw the flames breaking out, and the bridge\r\nlowered, than they thronged to the entrance, as well to prevent the\r\nescape of the garrison, as to secure their own share of booty ere the\r\ncastle should be burnt down. On the other hand, a party of the\r\nbesiegers who had entered by the postern were now issuing out into the\r\ncourt-yard, and attacking with fury the remnant of the defenders who\r\nwere thus assaulted on both sides at once.\r\n\r\nAnimated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their\r\nindomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with\r\nthe utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in\r\ndriving back the assailants, though much inferior in numbers. Rebecca,\r\nplaced on horseback before one of the Templar\xe2\x80\x99s Saracen slaves, was in\r\nthe midst of the little party; and Bois-Guilbert, notwithstanding the\r\nconfusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety.\r\nRepeatedly he was by her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held\r\nbefore her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon\r\nstarting from his position by her, he cried his war-cry, dashed\r\nforward, struck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on\r\nthe same instant once more at her bridle rein.\r\n\r\nAthelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,\r\nbeheld the female form whom the Templar protected thus sedulously, and\r\ndoubted not that it was Rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in\r\ndespite of all resistance which could be offered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the soul of Saint Edward,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will rescue her from yonder\r\nover-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink what you do!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9chasty hand catches frog for fish\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nmy bauble, yonder is none of my Lady Rowena\xe2\x80\x94see but her long dark\r\nlocks!\xe2\x80\x94Nay, an ye will not know black from white, ye may be leader, but\r\nI will be no follower\xe2\x80\x94no bones of mine shall be broken unless I know\r\nfor whom.\xe2\x80\x94And you without armour too!\xe2\x80\x94Bethink you, silk bonnet never\r\nkept out steel blade.\xe2\x80\x94Nay, then, if wilful will to water, wilful must\r\ndrench.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Deus vobiscum\xe2\x80\x99, most doughty Athelstane!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he concluded,\r\nloosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the Saxon\xe2\x80\x99s tunic.\r\n\r\nTo snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose\r\ndying grasp had just relinquished it\xe2\x80\x94to rush on the Templar\xe2\x80\x99s band, and\r\nto strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a\r\nwarrior at each blow, was, for Athelstane\xe2\x80\x99s great strength, now\r\nanimated with unusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was\r\nsoon within two yards of Bois-Guilbert, whom he defied in his loudest\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn, false-hearted Templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to\r\ntouch\xe2\x80\x94turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDog!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, grinding his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cI will teach thee to\r\nblaspheme the holy Order of the Temple of Zion;\xe2\x80\x9d and with these words,\r\nhalf-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the Saxon,\r\nand rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent\r\nof the horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of Athelstane.\r\n\r\nWell said Wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. So\r\ntrenchant was the Templar\xe2\x80\x99s weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had\r\nbeen a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the\r\nill-fated Saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head,\r\nlevelled him with the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ha! Beau-seant!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthus be it to the\r\nmaligners of the Temple-knights!\xe2\x80\x9d Taking advantage of the dismay which\r\nwas spread by the fall of Athelstane, and calling aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThose who\r\nwould save themselves, follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d he pushed across the drawbridge,\r\ndispersing the archers who would have intercepted them. He was followed\r\nby his Saracens, and some five or six men-at-arms, who had mounted\r\ntheir horses. The Templar\xe2\x80\x99s retreat was rendered perilous by the\r\nnumbers of arrows shot off at him and his party; but this did not\r\nprevent him from galloping round to the barbican, of which, according\r\nto his previous plan, he supposed it possible De Bracy might have been\r\nin possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Bracy! De Bracy!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cart thou there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I rescue thee?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bois-Guilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI have rendered me, rescue or no rescue. I\r\nwill be true prisoner. Save thyself\xe2\x80\x94there are hawks abroad\xe2\x80\x94put the seas\r\nbetwixt you and England\xe2\x80\x94I dare not say more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9can thou wilt tarry there, remember I\r\nhave redeemed word and glove. Be the hawks where they will, methinks\r\nthe walls of the Preceptory of Templestowe will be cover sufficient,\r\nand thither will I, like heron to her haunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, he galloped off with his followers.\r\n\r\nThose of the castle who had not gotten to horse, still continued to\r\nfight desperately with the besiegers, after the departure of the\r\nTemplar, but rather in despair of quarter than that they entertained\r\nany hope of escape. The fire was spreading rapidly through all parts of\r\nthe castle, when Ulrica, who had first kindled it, appeared on a\r\nturret, in the guise of one of the ancient furies, yelling forth a\r\nwar-song, such as was of yore raised on the field of battle by the\r\nscalds of the yet heathen Saxons. Her long dishevelled grey hair flew\r\nback from her uncovered head; the inebriating delight of gratified\r\nvengeance contended in her eyes with the fire of insanity; and she\r\nbrandished the distaff which she held in her hand, as if she had been\r\none of the Fatal Sisters, who spin and abridge the thread of human\r\nlife. Tradition has preserved some wild strophes of the barbarous hymn\r\nwhich she chanted wildly amid that scene of fire and of slaughter:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n1.\r\nWhet the bright steel,\r\nSons of the White Dragon!\r\nKindle the torch,\r\nDaughter of Hengist!\r\nThe steel glimmers not for the carving of the banquet,\r\nIt is hard, broad, and sharply pointed;\r\nThe torch goeth not to the bridal chamber,\r\nIt steams and glitters blue with sulphur.\r\nWhet the steel, the raven croaks!\r\nLight the torch, Zernebock is yelling!\r\nWhet the steel, sons of the Dragon!\r\nKindle the torch, daughter of Hengist!\r\n\r\n2.\r\nThe black cloud is low over the thane\xe2\x80\x99s castle\r\nThe eagle screams\xe2\x80\x94he rides on its bosom.\r\nScream not, grey rider of the sable cloud,\r\nThy banquet is prepared!\r\nThe maidens of Valhalla look forth,\r\nThe race of Hengist will send them guests.\r\nShake your black tresses, maidens of Valhalla!\r\nAnd strike your loud timbrels for joy!\r\nMany a haughty step bends to your halls,\r\nMany a helmed head.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nDark sits the evening upon the thanes castle,\r\nThe black clouds gather round;\r\nSoon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant!\r\nThe destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest against\r\nthem.\r\nHe, the bright consumer of palaces,\r\nBroad waves he his blazing banner,\r\nRed, wide and dusky,\r\nOver the strife of the valiant:\r\nHis joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers;\r\nHe loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from the\r\nwound!\r\n\r\n4.\r\nAll must perish!\r\nThe sword cleaveth the helmet;\r\nThe strong armour is pierced by the lance;\r\nFire devoureth the dwelling of princes,\r\nEngines break down the fences of the battle.\r\nAll must perish!\r\nThe race of Hengist is gone\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThe name of Horsa is no more!\r\nShrink not then from your doom, sons of the sword!\r\nLet your blades drink blood like wine;\r\nFeast ye in the banquet of slaughter,\r\nBy the light of the blazing halls!\r\nStrong be your swords while your blood is warm,\r\nAnd spare neither for pity nor fear,\r\nFor vengeance hath but an hour;\r\nStrong hate itself shall expire\r\nI also must perish! 39\r\n\r\n\r\nThe towering flames had now surmounted every obstruction, and rose to\r\nthe evening skies one huge and burning beacon, seen far and wide\r\nthrough the adjacent country. Tower after tower crashed down, with\r\nblazing roof and rafter; and the combatants were driven from the\r\ncourt-yard. The vanquished, of whom very few remained, scattered and\r\nescaped into the neighbouring wood. The victors, assembling in large\r\nbands, gazed with wonder, not unmixed with fear, upon the flames, in\r\nwhich their own ranks and arms glanced dusky red. The maniac figure of\r\nthe Saxon Ulrica was for a long time visible on the lofty stand she had\r\nchosen, tossing her arms abroad with wild exultation, as if she reined\r\nempress of the conflagration which she had raised. At length, with a\r\nterrific crash, the whole turret gave way, and she perished in the\r\nflames which had consumed her tyrant. An awful pause of horror silenced\r\neach murmur of the armed spectators, who, for the space of several\r\nminutes, stirred not a finger, save to sign the cross. The voice of\r\nLocksley was then heard, \xe2\x80\x9cShout, yeomen!\xe2\x80\x94the den of tyrants is no more!\r\nLet each bring his spoil to our chosen place of rendezvous at the\r\nTrysting-tree in the Harthill-walk; for there at break of day will we\r\nmake just partition among our own bands, together with our worthy\r\nallies in this great deed of vengeance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrust me each state must have its policies:\r\nKingdoms have edicts, cities have their charters;\r\nEven the wild outlaw, in his forest-walk,\r\nKeeps yet some touch of civil discipline;\r\nFor not since Adam wore his verdant apron,\r\nHath man with man in social union dwelt,\r\nBut laws were made to draw that union closer.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daylight had dawned upon the glades of the oak forest. The green\r\nboughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. The hind led her fawn\r\nfrom the covert of high fern to the more open walks of the greenwood,\r\nand no huntsman was there to watch or intercept the stately hart, as he\r\npaced at the head of the antler\xe2\x80\x99d herd.\r\n\r\nThe outlaws were all assembled around the Trysting-tree in the\r\nHarthill-walk, where they had spent the night in refreshing themselves\r\nafter the fatigues of the siege, some with wine, some with slumber,\r\nmany with hearing and recounting the events of the day, and computing\r\nthe heaps of plunder which their success had placed at the disposal of\r\ntheir Chief.\r\n\r\nThe spoils were indeed very large; for, notwithstanding that much was\r\nconsumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing,\r\nhad been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could\r\nbe appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. Yet so strict\r\nwere the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any\r\npart of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the\r\ndisposal of their leader.\r\n\r\nThe place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which\r\nLocksley had conducted Gurth and Wamba in the earlier part of the\r\nstory, but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within\r\nhalf a mile of the demolished castle of Torquilstone. Here Locksley\r\nassumed his seat\xe2\x80\x94a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of\r\nthe huge oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. He\r\nassigned to the Black Knight a seat at his right hand, and to Cedric a\r\nplace upon his left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon my freedom, noble sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in these glades I am\r\nmonarch\xe2\x80\x94they are my kingdom; and these my wild subjects would reck but\r\nlittle of my power, were I, within my own dominions, to yield place to\r\nmortal man.\xe2\x80\x94Now, sirs, who hath seen our chaplain? where is our curtal\r\nFriar? A mass amongst Christian men best begins a busy morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94No one\r\nhad seen the Clerk of Copmanhurst. \xe2\x80\x9cOver gods forbode!\xe2\x80\x9d said the outlaw\r\nchief, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust the jolly priest hath but abidden by the wine-pot a\r\nthought too late. Who saw him since the castle was ta\xe2\x80\x99en?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the Miller, \xe2\x80\x9cmarked him busy about the door of a cellar,\r\nswearing by each saint in the calendar he would taste the smack of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s Gascoigne wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the saints, as many as there be of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cforefend, lest he has drunk too deep of the wine-butts, and perished\r\nby the fall of the castle!\xe2\x80\x94Away, Miller!\xe2\x80\x94take with you enow of men,\r\nseek the place where you last saw him\xe2\x80\x94throw water from the moat on the\r\nscorching ruins\xe2\x80\x94I will have them removed stone by stone ere I lose my\r\ncurtal Friar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe numbers who hastened to execute this duty, considering that an\r\ninteresting division of spoil was about to take place, showed how much\r\nthe troop had at heart the safety of their spiritual father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, let us proceed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cfor when this bold deed\r\nshall be sounded abroad, the bands of De Bracy, of Malvoisin, and other\r\nallies of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, will be in motion against us, and it were well\r\nfor our safety that we retreat from the vicinity.\xe2\x80\x94Noble Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, turning to the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat spoil is divided into two portions;\r\ndo thou make choice of that which best suits thee, to recompense thy\r\npeople who were partakers with us in this adventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood yeoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cmy heart is oppressed with sadness. The\r\nnoble Athelstane of Coningsburgh is no more\xe2\x80\x94the last sprout of the\r\nsainted Confessor! Hopes have perished with him which can never\r\nreturn!\xe2\x80\x94A sparkle hath been quenched by his blood, which no human\r\nbreath can again rekindle! My people, save the few who are now with me,\r\ndo but tarry my presence to transport his honoured remains to their\r\nlast mansion. The Lady Rowena is desirous to return to Rotherwood, and\r\nmust be escorted by a sufficient force. I should, therefore, ere now,\r\nhave left this place; and I waited\xe2\x80\x94not to share the booty, for, so help\r\nme God and Saint Withold! as neither I nor any of mine will touch the\r\nvalue of a liard,\xe2\x80\x94I waited but to render my thanks to thee and to thy\r\nbold yeomen, for the life and honour ye have saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chief Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cwe did but half the work at\r\nmost\xe2\x80\x94take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and\r\nfollowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nCedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd some,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9chave been wise enough to reward themselves;\r\nthey do not march off empty-handed altogether. We do not all wear\r\nmotley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cour laws bind none but ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, thou, my poor knave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, turning about and embracing\r\nhis Jester, \xe2\x80\x9chow shall I reward thee, who feared not to give thy body\r\nto chains and death instead of mine!\xe2\x80\x94All forsook me, when the poor fool\r\nwas faithful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tear stood in the eye of the rough Thane as he spoke\xe2\x80\x94a mark of\r\nfeeling which even the death of Athelstane had not extracted; but there\r\nwas something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that\r\nwaked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, extricating himself from master\xe2\x80\x99s caress, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou pay my service with the water of your eye, the Jester must weep for\r\ncompany, and then what becomes of his vocation?\xe2\x80\x94But, uncle, if you\r\nwould indeed pleasure me, I pray you to pardon my playfellow Gurth, who\r\nstole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cI will both pardon and reward\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x94Kneel down, Gurth.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The swineherd was in an instant at his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s feet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTHEOW and ESNE 40 art thou no longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric\r\ntouching him with a wand; \xe2\x80\x9cFOLKFREE and SACLESS 41 art thou in town and\r\nfrom town, in the forest as in the field. A hide of land I give to thee\r\nin my steads of Walbrugham, from me and mine to thee and thine aye and\r\nfor ever; and God\xe2\x80\x99s malison on his head who this gainsays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, Gurth sprung upon his\r\nfeet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA smith and a file,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cto do away the collar from the neck of\r\na freeman!\xe2\x80\x94Noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and\r\ndoubly will I fight for you!\xe2\x80\x94There is a free spirit in my breast\xe2\x80\x94I am a\r\nman changed to myself and all around.\xe2\x80\x94Ha, Fangs!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthat faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump\r\nupon him, to express his sympathy,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cknowest thou thy master still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cFangs and I still know thee, Gurth, though we must\r\nneeds abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us\r\nand thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall forget myself indeed ere I forget thee, true comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGurth; \xe2\x80\x9cand were freedom fit for thee, Wamba, the master would not let\r\nthee want it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cnever think I envy thee, brother Gurth; the serf\r\nsits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of\r\nbattle\xe2\x80\x94And what saith Oldhelm of Malmsbury\xe2\x80\x94Better a fool at a feast\r\nthan a wise man at a fray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tramp of horses was now heard, and the Lady Rowena appeared,\r\nsurrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who\r\njoyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her\r\nfreedom. She herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut\r\npalfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an\r\nunwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone.\r\nHer lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope\r\nfor the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past\r\ndeliverance\xe2\x80\x94She knew that Ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that\r\nAthelstane was dead. The former assurance filled her with the most\r\nsincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter,\r\nshe might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed\r\nfrom further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been\r\ncontradicted by her guardian Cedric.\r\n\r\nAs Rowena bent her steed towards Locksley\xe2\x80\x99s seat, that bold yeoman,\r\nwith all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general\r\ninstinct of courtesy. The blood rose to her cheeks, as, courteously\r\nwaving her hand, and bending so low that her beautiful and loose\r\ntresses were for an instant mixed with the flowing mane of her palfrey,\r\nshe expressed in few but apt words her obligations and her gratitude to\r\nLocksley and her other deliverers.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, brave men,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9cGod and Our Lady bless you and requite you for gallantly\r\nperilling yourselves in the cause of the oppressed!\xe2\x80\x94If any of you\r\nshould hunger, remember Rowena has food\xe2\x80\x94if you should thirst, she has\r\nmany a butt of wine and brown ale\xe2\x80\x94and if the Normans drive ye from\r\nthese walks, Rowena has forests of her own, where her gallant\r\ndeliverers may range at full freedom, and never ranger ask whose arrow\r\nhath struck down the deer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, gentle lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cthanks from my company and\r\nmyself. But, to have saved you requites itself. We who walk the\r\ngreenwood do many a wild deed, and the Lady Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s deliverance may be\r\nreceived as an atonement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain bowing from her palfrey, Rowena turned to depart; but pausing a\r\nmoment, while Cedric, who was to attend her, was also taking his leave,\r\nshe found herself unexpectedly close by the prisoner De Bracy. He stood\r\nunder a tree in deep meditation, his arms crossed upon his breast, and\r\nRowena was in hopes she might pass him unobserved. He looked up,\r\nhowever, and, when aware of her presence, a deep flush of shame\r\nsuffused his handsome countenance. He stood a moment most irresolute;\r\nthen, stepping forward, took her palfrey by the rein, and bent his knee\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the Lady Rowena deign to cast an eye\xe2\x80\x94on a captive knight\xe2\x80\x94on a\r\ndishonoured soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cin enterprises such as yours, the real\r\ndishonour lies not in failure, but in success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConquest, lady, should soften the heart,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9clet me\r\nbut know that the Lady Rowena forgives the violence occasioned by an\r\nill-fated passion, and she shall soon learn that De Bracy knows how to\r\nserve her in nobler ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cas a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she does not forgive him at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can never forgive the misery and desolation your madness has\r\noccasioned,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rowena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnloose your hold on the lady\xe2\x80\x99s rein,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, coming up. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the\r\nbright sun above us, but it were shame, I would pin thee to the earth\r\nwith my javelin\xe2\x80\x94but be well assured, thou shalt smart, Maurice de\r\nBracy, for thy share in this foul deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe threatens safely who threatens a prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwhen had a Saxon any touch of courtesy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen retiring two steps backward, he permitted the lady to move on.\r\n\r\nCedric, ere they departed, expressed his peculiar gratitude to the\r\nBlack Champion, and earnestly entreated him to accompany him to\r\nRotherwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat ye errant knights desire to carry your\r\nfortunes on the point of your lance, and reck not of land or goods; but\r\nwar is a changeful mistress, and a home is sometimes desirable even to\r\nthe champion whose trade is wandering. Thou hast earned one in the\r\nhalls of Rotherwood, noble knight. Cedric has wealth enough to repair\r\nthe injuries of fortune, and all he has is his deliverer\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Come,\r\ntherefore, to Rotherwood, not as a guest, but as a son or brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCedric has already made me rich,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che has taught me\r\nthe value of Saxon virtue. To Rotherwood will I come, brave Saxon, and\r\nthat speedily; but, as now, pressing matters of moment detain me from\r\nyour halls. Peradventure when I come hither, I will ask such a boon as\r\nwill put even thy generosity to the test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is granted ere spoken out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, striking his ready hand\r\ninto the gauntleted palm of the Black Knight,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is granted already,\r\nwere it to affect half my fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGage not thy promise so lightly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight of the Fetterlock;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyet well I hope to gain the boon I shall ask. Meanwhile, adieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have but to say,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Saxon, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, during the funeral rites\r\nof the noble Athelstane, I shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his\r\ncastle of Coningsburgh\xe2\x80\x94They will be open to all who choose to partake\r\nof the funeral banqueting; and, I speak in name of the noble Edith,\r\nmother of the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who\r\nlaboured so bravely, though unsuccessfully, to save Athelstane from\r\nNorman chains and Norman steel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crare feeding there will be\xe2\x80\x94pity that the noble Athelstane cannot\r\nbanquet at his own funeral.\xe2\x80\x94But he,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Jester, lifting up\r\nhis eyes gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cis supping in Paradise, and doubtless does honour to\r\nthe cheer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, and move on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, his anger at this untimely jest\r\nbeing checked by the recollection of Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s recent services. Rowena\r\nwaved a graceful adieu to him of the Fetterlock\xe2\x80\x94the Saxon bade God\r\nspeed him, and on they moved through a wide glade of the forest.\r\n\r\nThey had scarce departed, ere a sudden procession moved from under the\r\ngreenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and\r\ntook the same direction with Rowena and her followers. The priests of a\r\nneighbouring convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csoul-scat\xe2\x80\x9d, which Cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which\r\nthe body of Athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly and\r\nslowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of\r\nConingsburgh, to be there deposited in the grave of Hengist, from whom\r\nthe deceased derived his long descent. Many of his vassals had\r\nassembled at the news of his death, and followed the bier with all the\r\nexternal marks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. Again the outlaws\r\narose, and paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which\r\nthey had so lately rendered to beauty\xe2\x80\x94the slow chant and mournful step\r\nof the priests brought back to their remembrance such of their comrades\r\nas had fallen in the yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s array. But such recollections dwell\r\nnot long with those who lead a life of danger and enterprise, and ere\r\nthe sound of the death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were\r\nagain busied in the distribution of their spoil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValiant knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley to the Black Champion, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout whose\r\ngood heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed,\r\nwill it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best\r\nserve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my Trysting-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept the offer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cas frankly as it is given; and\r\nI ask permission to dispose of Sir Maurice de Bracy at my own\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is thine already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cand well for him! else the\r\ntyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his\r\nFree-Companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x94But he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art free\xe2\x80\x94depart. He whose prisoner\r\nthou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. But beware of\r\nthe future, lest a worse thing befall thee.\xe2\x80\x94Maurice de Bracy, I say\r\nBEWARE!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the\r\nyeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. The proud\r\nknight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his\r\nform to its full height, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cPeace, ye yelping curs! who\r\nopen upon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay\xe2\x80\x94De Bracy\r\nscorns your censure as he would disdain your applause. To your brakes\r\nand caves, ye outlawed thieves! and be silent when aught knightly or\r\nnoble is but spoken within a league of your fox-earths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ill-timed defiance might have procured for De Bracy a volley of\r\narrows, but for the hasty and imperative interference of the outlaw\r\nChief. Meanwhile the knight caught a horse by the rein, for several\r\nwhich had been taken in the stables of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf stood accoutred\r\naround, and were a valuable part of the booty. He threw himself upon\r\nthe saddle, and galloped off through the wood.\r\n\r\nWhen the bustle occasioned by this incident was somewhat composed, the\r\nchief Outlaw took from his neck the rich horn and baldric which he had\r\nrecently gained at the strife of archery near Ashby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoble knight.\xe2\x80\x9d he said to him of the Fetterlock, \xe2\x80\x9cif you disdain not\r\nto grace by your acceptance a bugle which an English yeoman has once\r\nworn, this I will pray you to keep as a memorial of your gallant\r\nbearing\xe2\x80\x94and if ye have aught to do, and, as happeneth oft to a gallant\r\nknight, ye chance to be hard bested in any forest between Trent and\r\nTees, wind three mots 42 upon the horn thus, \xe2\x80\x98Wa-sa-hoa!\xe2\x80\x99 and it may\r\nwell chance ye shall find helpers and rescue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then gave breath to the bugle, and winded once and again the call\r\nwhich he described, until the knight had caught the notes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGramercy for the gift, bold yeoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cand better help\r\nthan thine and thy rangers would I never seek, were it at my utmost\r\nneed.\xe2\x80\x9d And then in his turn he winded the call till all the greenwood\r\nrang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell blown and clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman; \xe2\x80\x9cbeshrew me an thou knowest\r\nnot as much of woodcraft as of war!\xe2\x80\x94thou hast been a striker of deer in\r\nthy day, I warrant.\xe2\x80\x94Comrades, mark these three mots\xe2\x80\x94it is the call of\r\nthe Knight of the Fetterlock; and he who hears it, and hastens not to\r\nserve him at his need, I will have him scourged out of our band with\r\nhis own bowstring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong live our leader!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the yeomen, \xe2\x80\x9cand long live the Black\r\nKnight of the Fetterlock!\xe2\x80\x94May he soon use our service, to prove how\r\nreadily it will be paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLocksley now proceeded to the distribution of the spoil, which he\r\nperformed with the most laudable impartiality. A tenth part of the\r\nwhole was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was\r\nnext allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the\r\nwidows and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in\r\nmasses for the souls of such as had left no surviving family. The rest\r\nwas divided amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and\r\nthe judgment of the Chief, on all such doubtful questions as occurred,\r\nwas delivered with great shrewdness, and received with absolute\r\nsubmission. The Black Knight was not a little surprised to find that\r\nmen, in a state so lawless, were nevertheless among themselves so\r\nregularly and equitably governed, and all that he observed added to his\r\nopinion of the justice and judgment of their leader.\r\n\r\nWhen each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the\r\ntreasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that\r\nbelonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the\r\nportion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could hear tidings of our joyous\r\nchaplain\xe2\x80\x94he was never wont to be absent when meat was to be blessed, or\r\nspoil to be parted; and it is his duty to take care of these the tithes\r\nof our successful enterprise. It may be the office has helped to cover\r\nsome of his canonical irregularities. Also, I have a holy brother of\r\nhis a prisoner at no great distance, and I would fain have the Friar to\r\nhelp me to deal with him in due sort\xe2\x80\x94I greatly misdoubt the safety of\r\nthe bluff priest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI were right sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight of the Fetterlock, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nI stand indebted to him for the joyous hospitality of a merry night in\r\nhis cell. Let us to the ruins of the castle; it may be we shall there\r\nlearn some tidings of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they thus spoke, a loud shout among the yeomen announced the\r\narrival of him for whom they feared, as they learned from the\r\nstentorian voice of the Friar himself, long before they saw his burly\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake room, my merry-men!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9croom for your godly father\r\nand his prisoner\xe2\x80\x94Cry welcome once more.\xe2\x80\x94I come, noble leader, like an\r\neagle with my prey in my clutch.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And making his way through the ring,\r\namidst the laughter of all around, he appeared in majestic triumph, his\r\nhuge partisan in one hand, and in the other a halter, one end of which\r\nwas fastened to the neck of the unfortunate Isaac of York, who, bent\r\ndown by sorrow and terror, was dragged on by the victorious priest, who\r\nshouted aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Allan-a-Dale, to chronicle me in a ballad, or\r\nif it were but a lay?\xe2\x80\x94By Saint Hermangild, the jingling crowder is ever\r\nout of the way where there is an apt theme for exalting valour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurtal Priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast been at a wet mass this\r\nmorning, as early as it is. In the name of Saint Nicholas, whom hast\r\nthou got here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA captive to my sword and to my lance, noble Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nClerk of Copmanhurst; \xe2\x80\x9cto my bow and to my halberd, I should rather\r\nsay; and yet I have redeemed him by my divinity from a worse captivity.\r\nSpeak, Jew\xe2\x80\x94have I not ransomed thee from Sathanas?\xe2\x80\x94have I not taught\r\nthee thy \xe2\x80\x98credo\xe2\x80\x99, thy \xe2\x80\x98pater\xe2\x80\x99, and thine \xe2\x80\x98Ave Maria\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x94Did I not spend\r\nthe whole night in drinking to thee, and in expounding of mysteries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the love of God!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the poor Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cwill no one take me\r\nout of the keeping of this mad\xe2\x80\x94I mean this holy man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this, Jew?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, with a menacing aspect; \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou\r\nrecant, Jew?\xe2\x80\x94Bethink thee, if thou dost relapse into thine infidelity,\r\nthough thou are not so tender as a suckling pig\xe2\x80\x94I would I had one to\r\nbreak my fast upon\xe2\x80\x94thou art not too tough to be roasted! Be\r\nconformable, Isaac, and repeat the words after me. \xe2\x80\x98Ave Maria\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, we will have no profanation, mad Priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9clet us\r\nrather hear where you found this prisoner of thine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Saint Dunstan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9cI found him where I sought for\r\nbetter ware! I did step into the cellarage to see what might be rescued\r\nthere; for though a cup of burnt wine, with spice, be an evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrought for an emperor, it were waste, methought, to let so much good\r\nliquor be mulled at once; and I had caught up one runlet of sack, and\r\nwas coming to call more aid among these lazy knaves, who are ever to\r\nseek when a good deed is to be done, when I was avised of a strong\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94Aha! thought I, here is the choicest juice of all in this secret\r\ncrypt; and the knave butler, being disturbed in his vocation, hath left\r\nthe key in the door\xe2\x80\x94In therefore I went, and found just nought besides\r\na commodity of rusted chains and this dog of a Jew, who presently\r\nrendered himself my prisoner, rescue or no rescue. I did but refresh\r\nmyself after the fatigue of the action, with the unbeliever, with one\r\nhumming cup of sack, and was proceeding to lead forth my captive, when,\r\ncrash after crash, as with wild thunder-dint and levin-fire, down\r\ntoppled the masonry of an outer tower, (marry beshrew their hands that\r\nbuilt it not the firmer!) and blocked up the passage. The roar of one\r\nfalling tower followed another\xe2\x80\x94I gave up thought of life; and deeming\r\nit a dishonour to one of my profession to pass out of this world in\r\ncompany with a Jew, I heaved up my halberd to beat his brains out; but\r\nI took pity on his grey hairs, and judged it better to lay down the\r\npartisan, and take up my spiritual weapon for his conversion. And\r\ntruly, by the blessing of Saint Dunstan, the seed has been sown in good\r\nsoil; only that, with speaking to him of mysteries through the whole\r\nnight, and being in a manner fasting, (for the few droughts of sack\r\nwhich I sharpened my wits with were not worth marking,) my head is\r\nwell-nigh dizzied, I trow.\xe2\x80\x94But I was clean exhausted.\xe2\x80\x94Gilbert and\r\nWibbald know in what state they found me\xe2\x80\x94quite and clean exhausted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can bear witness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gilbert; \xe2\x80\x9cfor when we had cleared away the\r\nruin, and by Saint Dunstan\xe2\x80\x99s help lighted upon the dungeon stair, we\r\nfound the runlet of sack half empty, the Jew half dead, and the Friar\r\nmore than half\xe2\x80\x94exhausted, as he calls it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe be knaves! ye lie!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the offended Friar; \xe2\x80\x9cit was you and\r\nyour gormandizing companions that drank up the sack, and called it your\r\nmorning draught\xe2\x80\x94I am a pagan, an I kept it not for the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nthroat. But what recks it? The Jew is converted, and understands all I\r\nhave told him, very nearly, if not altogether, as well as myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJew,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cis this true? hast thou renounced thine\r\nunbelief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I so find mercy in your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cas I know not one\r\nword which the reverend prelate spake to me all this fearful night.\r\nAlas! I was so distraught with agony, and fear, and grief, that had our\r\nholy father Abraham come to preach to me, he had found but a deaf\r\nlistener.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou liest, Jew, and thou knowest thou dost.\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar; \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nremind thee of but one word of our conference\xe2\x80\x94thou didst promise to\r\ngive all thy substance to our holy Order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo help me the Promise, fair sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, even more alarmed than\r\nbefore, \xe2\x80\x9cas no such sounds ever crossed my lips! Alas! I am an aged\r\nbeggar\xe2\x80\x99d man\xe2\x80\x94I fear me a childless\xe2\x80\x94have ruth on me, and let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou dost retract vows made in favour of\r\nholy Church, thou must do penance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of it\r\nlustily on the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, had not the Black Knight stopped the\r\nblow, and thereby transferred the Holy Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s resentment to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Saint Thomas of Kent,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9can I buckle to my gear, I will\r\nteach thee, sir lazy lover, to mell with thine own matters, maugre\r\nthine iron case there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, be not wroth with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest I am thy\r\nsworn friend and comrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Friar; \xe2\x80\x9cand defy thee for a\r\nmeddling coxcomb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, who seemed to take a pleasure in provoking\r\nhis quondam host, \xe2\x80\x9chast thou forgotten how, that for my sake (for I say\r\nnothing of the temptation of the flagon and the pasty) thou didst break\r\nthy vow of fast and vigil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, clenching his huge fist, \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nbestow a buffet on thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accept of no such presents,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cI am content to take\r\nthy cuff 421 as a loan, but I will repay thee with usury as deep as\r\never thy prisoner there exacted in his traffic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will prove that presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHola!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat art thou after, mad Friar? brawling\r\nbeneath our Trysting-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo brawling,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cit is but a friendly interchange of\r\ncourtesy.\xe2\x80\x94Friar, strike an thou darest\xe2\x80\x94I will stand thy blow, if thou\r\nwilt stand mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast the advantage with that iron pot on thy head,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nchurchman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut have at thee\xe2\x80\x94Down thou goest, an thou wert Goliath of\r\nGath in his brazen helmet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Friar bared his brawny arm up to the elbow, and putting his full\r\nstrength to the blow, gave the Knight a buffet that might have felled\r\nan ox. But his adversary stood firm as a rock. A loud shout was uttered\r\nby all the yeomen around; for the Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s cuff was proverbial amongst\r\nthem, and there were few who, in jest or earnest, had not had the\r\noccasion to know its vigour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said, the Knight, pulling off his gauntlet, \xe2\x80\x9cif I had\r\nvantage on my head, I will have none on my hand\xe2\x80\x94stand fast as a true\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Genam meam dedi vapulatori\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I have given my cheek to the smiter,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Priest; \xe2\x80\x9can thou canst stir me from the spot, fellow, I will\r\nfreely bestow on thee the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the burly Priest, assuming, on his part, high defiance. But\r\nwho may resist his fate? The buffet of the Knight was given with such\r\nstrength and good-will, that the Friar rolled head over heels upon the\r\nplain, to the great amazement of all the spectators. But he arose\r\nneither angry nor crestfallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shouldst have used thy strength\r\nwith more discretion. I had mumbled but a lame mass an thou hadst\r\nbroken my jaw, for the piper plays ill that wants the nether chops.\r\nNevertheless, there is my hand, in friendly witness, that I will\r\nexchange no more cuffs with thee, having been a loser by the barter.\r\nEnd now all unkindness. Let us put the Jew to ransom, since the leopard\r\nwill not change his spots, and a Jew he will continue to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Priest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clement, \xe2\x80\x9cis not half so confident of the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversion, since he received that buffet on the ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to, knave, what pratest thou of conversions?\xe2\x80\x94what, is there no\r\nrespect?\xe2\x80\x94all masters and no men?\xe2\x80\x94I tell thee, fellow, I was somewhat\r\ntotty when I received the good knight\xe2\x80\x99s blow, or I had kept my ground\r\nunder it. But an thou gibest more of it, thou shalt learn I can give as\r\nwell as take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace all!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou, Jew, think of thy ransom;\r\nthou needest not to be told that thy race are held to be accursed in\r\nall Christian communities, and trust me that we cannot endure thy\r\npresence among us. Think, therefore, of an offer, while I examine a\r\nprisoner of another cast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere many of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s men taken?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded the Black Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone of note enough to be put to ransom,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9ca set\r\nof hilding fellows there were, whom we dismissed to find them a new\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94enough had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them\r\nwere not worth a cardecu. The prisoner I speak of is better booty\xe2\x80\x94a\r\njolly monk riding to visit his leman, an I may judge by his horse-gear\r\nand wearing apparel.\xe2\x80\x94Here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a\r\npyet.\xe2\x80\x9d And, between two yeomen, was brought before the silvan throne of\r\nthe outlaw Chief, our old friend, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94-Flower of warriors,\r\nHow is\xe2\x80\x99t with Titus Lartius?\r\nMARCIUS.\xe2\x80\x94As with a man busied about decrees,\r\nCondemning some to death and some to exile,\r\nRansoming him or pitying, threatening the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORIOLANUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe captive Abbot\xe2\x80\x99s features and manners exhibited a whimsical mixture\r\nof offended pride, and deranged foppery and bodily terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how now, my masters?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a voice in which all three\r\nemotions were blended. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat order is this among ye? Be ye Turks or\r\nChristians, that handle a churchman?\xe2\x80\x94Know ye what it is, \xe2\x80\x98manus\r\nimponere in servos Domini\xe2\x80\x99? Ye have plundered my mails\xe2\x80\x94torn my cope of\r\ncurious cut lace, which might have served a cardinal!\xe2\x80\x94Another in my\r\nplace would have been at his \xe2\x80\x98excommunicabo vos\xe2\x80\x99; but I am placible,\r\nand if ye order forth my palfreys, release my brethren, and restore my\r\nmails, tell down with all speed an hundred crowns to be expended in\r\nmasses at the high altar of Jorvaulx Abbey, and make your vow to eat no\r\nvenison until next Pentecost, it may be you shall hear little more of\r\nthis mad frolic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly Father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chief Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cit grieves me to think that you\r\nhave met with such usage from any of my followers, as calls for your\r\nfatherly reprehension.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsage!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the priest, encouraged by the mild tone of the silvan\r\nleader; \xe2\x80\x9cit were usage fit for no hound of good race\xe2\x80\x94much less for a\r\nChristian\xe2\x80\x94far less for a priest\xe2\x80\x94and least of all for the Prior of the\r\nholy community of Jorvaulx. Here is a profane and drunken minstrel,\r\ncalled Allan-a-Dale\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98nebulo quidam\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94who has menaced me with corporal\r\npunishment\xe2\x80\x94nay, with death itself, an I pay not down four hundred\r\ncrowns of ransom, to the boot of all the treasure he hath already\r\nrobbed me of\xe2\x80\x94gold chains and gymmal rings to an unknown value; besides\r\nwhat is broken and spoiled among their rude hands, such as my\r\npouncer-box and silver crisping-tongs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible that Allan-a-Dale can have thus treated a man of your\r\nreverend bearing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true as the gospel of Saint Nicodemus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nswore, with many a cruel north-country oath, that he would hang me up\r\non the highest tree in the greenwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he so in very deed? Nay, then, reverend father, I think you had\r\nbetter comply with his demands\xe2\x80\x94for Allan-a-Dale is the very man to\r\nabide by his word when he has so pledged it.\xe2\x80\x9d 43\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do but jest with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astounded Prior, with a forced\r\nlaugh; \xe2\x80\x9cand I love a good jest with all my heart. But, ha! ha! ha! when\r\nthe mirth has lasted the livelong night, it is time to be grave in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am as grave as a father confessor,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Outlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmust pay a round ransom, Sir Prior, or your convent is likely to be\r\ncalled to a new election; for your place will know you no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre ye Christians,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cand hold this language to a\r\nchurchman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristians! ay, marry are we, and have divinity among us to boot,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered the Outlaw. \xe2\x80\x9cLet our buxom chaplain stand forth, and expound\r\nto this reverend father the texts which concern this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Friar, half-drunk, half-sober, had huddled a friar\xe2\x80\x99s frock over his\r\ngreen cassock, and now summoning together whatever scraps of learning\r\nhe had acquired by rote in former days, \xe2\x80\x9cHoly father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Deus\r\nfaciat salvam benignitatem vestram\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94You are welcome to the greenwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat profane mummery is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior. \xe2\x80\x9cFriend, if thou be\xe2\x80\x99st\r\nindeed of the church, it were a better deed to show me how I may escape\r\nfrom these men\xe2\x80\x99s hands, than to stand ducking and grinning here like a\r\nmorris-dancer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9cI know but one mode in which\r\nthou mayst escape. This is Saint Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s day with us, we are taking\r\nour tithes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not of the church, then, I trust, my good brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPrior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf church and lay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar; \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore, Sir Prior \xe2\x80\x98facite\r\nvobis amicos de Mammone iniquitatis\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94make yourselves friends of the\r\nMammon of unrighteousness, for no other friendship is like to serve\r\nyour turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love a jolly woodsman at heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, softening his tone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome, ye must not deal too hard with me\xe2\x80\x94I can well of woodcraft, and\r\ncan wind a horn clear and lustily, and hollo till every oak rings\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94Come, ye must not deal too hard with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him a horn,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will prove the skill he boasts\r\nof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prior Aymer winded a blast accordingly. The Captain shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthou blowest a merry note, but it may not ransom\r\nthee\xe2\x80\x94we cannot afford, as the legend on a good knight\xe2\x80\x99s shield hath it,\r\nto set thee free for a blast. Moreover, I have found thee\xe2\x80\x94thou art one\r\nof those, who, with new French graces and Tra-li-ras, disturb the\r\nancient English bugle notes.\xe2\x80\x94Prior, that last flourish on the recheat\r\nhath added fifty crowns to thy ransom, for corrupting the true old\r\nmanly blasts of venerie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Abbot, peevishly, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art ill to please with\r\nthy woodcraft. I pray thee be more conformable in this matter of my\r\nransom. At a word\xe2\x80\x94since I must needs, for once, hold a candle to the\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x94what ransom am I to pay for walking on Watling-street, without\r\nhaving fifty men at my back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it not well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Lieutenant of the gang apart to the\r\nCaptain, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Prior should name the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s ransom, and the Jew name\r\nthe Prior\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a mad knave,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cbut thy plan\r\ntranscends!\xe2\x80\x94Here, Jew, step forth\xe2\x80\x94Look at that holy Father Aymer, Prior\r\nof the rich Abbey of Jorvaulx, and tell us at what ransom we should\r\nhold him?\xe2\x80\x94Thou knowest the income of his convent, I warrant thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, assuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac. \xe2\x80\x9cI have trafficked with the good fathers,\r\nand bought wheat and barley, and fruits of the earth, and also much\r\nwool. O, it is a rich abbey-stede, and they do live upon the fat, and\r\ndrink the sweet wines upon the lees, these good fathers of Jorvaulx.\r\nAh, if an outcast like me had such a home to go to, and such incomings\r\nby the year and by the month, I would pay much gold and silver to\r\nredeem my captivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHound of a Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cno one knows better than thy\r\nown cursed self, that our holy house of God is indebted for the\r\nfinishing of our chancel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for the storing of your cellars in the last season with the due\r\nallowance of Gascon wine,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x94that is small\r\nmatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the infidel dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said the churchman; \xe2\x80\x9che jangles as if our holy\r\ncommunity did come under debts for the wines we have a license to\r\ndrink, \xe2\x80\x98propter necessitatem, et ad frigus depellendum\xe2\x80\x99. The\r\ncircumcised villain blasphemeth the holy church, and Christian men\r\nlisten and rebuke him not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this helps nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIsaac, pronounce what he\r\nmay pay, without flaying both hide and hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn six hundred crowns,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cthe good Prior might well pay to\r\nyour honoured valours, and never sit less soft in his stall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix hundred crowns,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cI am contented\xe2\x80\x94thou\r\nhast well spoken, Isaac\xe2\x80\x94six hundred crowns.\xe2\x80\x94It is a sentence, Sir\r\nPrior.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sentence!\xe2\x80\x94a sentence!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the band; \xe2\x80\x9cSolomon had not done it\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hearest thy doom, Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d said the leader.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are mad, my masters,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere am I to find such a\r\nsum? If I sell the very pyx and candlesticks on the altar at Jorvaulx,\r\nI shall scarce raise the half; and it will be necessary for that\r\npurpose that I go to Jorvaulx myself; ye may retain as borrows 44 my\r\ntwo priests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be but blind trust,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will retain thee,\r\nPrior, and send them to fetch thy ransom. Thou shalt not want a cup of\r\nwine and a collop of venison the while; and if thou lovest woodcraft,\r\nthou shalt see such as your north country never witnessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, if so please you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, willing to curry favour with the\r\noutlaws, \xe2\x80\x9cI can send to York for the six hundred crowns, out of certain\r\nmonies in my hands, if so be that the most reverend Prior present will\r\ngrant me a quittance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shall grant thee whatever thou dost list, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand thou shalt lay down the redemption money for Prior Aymer as well\r\nas for thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself! ah, courageous sirs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a broken and\r\nimpoverished man; a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s staff must be my portion through life,\r\nsupposing I were to pay you fifty crowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Prior shall judge of that matter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow say\r\nyou, Father Aymer? Can the Jew afford a good ransom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he afford a ransom?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Prior \xe2\x80\x9cIs he not Isaac of York,\r\nrich enough to redeem the captivity of the ten tribes of Israel, who\r\nwere led into Assyrian bondage?\xe2\x80\x94I have seen but little of him myself,\r\nbut our cellarer and treasurer have dealt largely with him, and report\r\nsays that his house at York is so full of gold and silver as is a shame\r\nin any Christian land. Marvel it is to all living Christian hearts that\r\nsuch gnawing adders should be suffered to eat into the bowels of the\r\nstate, and even of the holy church herself, with foul usuries and\r\nextortions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cmitigate and assuage your choler. I pray\r\nof your reverence to remember that I force my monies upon no one. But\r\nwhen churchman and layman, prince and prior, knight and priest, come\r\nknocking to Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s door, they borrow not his shekels with these\r\nuncivil terms. It is then, Friend Isaac, will you pleasure us in this\r\nmatter, and our day shall be truly kept, so God sa\xe2\x80\x99 me?\xe2\x80\x94and Kind Isaac,\r\nif ever you served man, show yourself a friend in this need! And when\r\nthe day comes, and I ask my own, then what hear I but Damned Jew, and\r\nThe curse of Egypt on your tribe, and all that may stir up the rude and\r\nuncivil populace against poor strangers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrior,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cJew though he be, he hath in this spoken\r\nwell. Do thou, therefore, name his ransom, as he named thine, without\r\nfarther rude terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone but \xe2\x80\x98latro famosus\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the interpretation whereof,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill I give at some other time and tide\xe2\x80\x94would place a Christian\r\nprelate and an unbaptized Jew upon the same bench. But since ye require\r\nme to put a price upon this caitiff, I tell you openly that ye will\r\nwrong yourselves if you take from him a penny under a thousand crowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sentence!\xe2\x80\x94a sentence!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the chief Outlaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sentence!\xe2\x80\x94a sentence!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted his assessors; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Christian has\r\nshown his good nurture, and dealt with us more generously than the\r\nJew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe God of my fathers help me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew; \xe2\x80\x9cwill ye bear to the\r\nground an impoverished creature?\xe2\x80\x94I am this day childless, and will ye\r\ndeprive me of the means of livelihood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wilt have the less to provide for, Jew, if thou art childless,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Aymer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! my lord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cyour law permits you not to know how the\r\nchild of our bosom is entwined with the strings of our heart\xe2\x80\x94O Rebecca!\r\nlaughter of my beloved Rachel! were each leaf on that tree a zecchin,\r\nand each zecchin mine own, all that mass of wealth would I give to know\r\nwhether thou art alive, and escaped the hands of the Nazarene!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas not thy daughter dark-haired?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the outlaws; \xe2\x80\x9cand wore\r\nshe not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did!\xe2\x80\x94she did!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as\r\nformerly with fear. \xe2\x80\x9cThe blessing of Jacob be upon thee! canst thou\r\ntell me aught of her safety?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was she, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cwho was carried off by the proud\r\nTemplar, when he broke through our ranks on yester-even. I had drawn my\r\nbow to send a shaft after him, but spared him even for the sake of the\r\ndamsel, who I feared might take harm from the arrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cI would to God thou hadst shot, though the\r\narrow had pierced her bosom!\xe2\x80\x94Better the tomb of her fathers than the\r\ndishonourable couch of the licentious and savage Templar. Ichabod!\r\nIchabod! the glory hath departed from my house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chief, looking round, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old man is but a Jew,\r\nnatheless his grief touches me.\xe2\x80\x94Deal uprightly with us, Isaac\xe2\x80\x94will\r\npaying this ransom of a thousand crowns leave thee altogether\r\npenniless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac, recalled to think of his worldly goods, the love of which, by\r\ndint of inveterate habit, contended even with his parental affection,\r\ngrew pale, stammered, and could not deny there might be some small\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94go to\xe2\x80\x94what though there be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not reckon\r\nwith thee too closely. Without treasure thou mayst as well hope to\r\nredeem thy child from the clutches of Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as to\r\nshoot a stag-royal with a headless shaft.\xe2\x80\x94We will take thee at the same\r\nransom with Prior Aymer, or rather at one hundred crowns lower, which\r\nhundred crowns shall be mine own peculiar loss, and not light upon this\r\nworshipful community; and so we shall avoid the heinous offence of\r\nrating a Jew merchant as high as a Christian prelate, and thou wilt\r\nhave six hundred crowns remaining to treat for thy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s ransom.\r\nTemplars love the glitter of silver shekels as well as the sparkle of\r\nblack eyes.\xe2\x80\x94Hasten to make thy crowns chink in the ear of De\r\nBois-Guilbert, ere worse comes of it. Thou wilt find him, as our scouts\r\nhave brought notice, at the next Preceptory house of his Order.\xe2\x80\x94Said I\r\nwell, my merry mates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yeomen expressed their wonted acquiescence in their leader\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion; and Isaac, relieved of one half of his apprehensions, by\r\nlearning that his daughter lived, and might possibly be ransomed, threw\r\nhimself at the feet of the generous Outlaw, and, rubbing his beard\r\nagainst his buskins, sought to kiss the hem of his green cassock. The\r\nCaptain drew himself back, and extricated himself from the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s grasp,\r\nnot without some marks of contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! I am English born, and love no\r\nsuch Eastern prostrations\xe2\x80\x94Kneel to God, and not to a poor sinner, like\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prior Aymer; \xe2\x80\x9ckneel to God, as represented in the\r\nservant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and\r\ndue gifts to the shrine of Saint Robert, what grace thou mayst acquire\r\nfor thyself and thy daughter Rebecca? I grieve for the maiden, for she\r\nis of fair and comely countenance,\xe2\x80\x94I beheld her in the lists of Ashby.\r\nAlso Brian de Bois-Guilbert is one with whom I may do much\xe2\x80\x94bethink thee\r\nhow thou mayst deserve my good word with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! alas!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9con every hand the spoilers arise against\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94I am given as a prey unto the Assyrian, and a prey unto him of\r\nEgypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nPrior; \xe2\x80\x9cfor what saith holy writ, \xe2\x80\x98verbum Domini projecerunt, et\r\nsapientia est nulla in eis\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94they have cast forth the word of the Lord,\r\nand there is no wisdom in them; \xe2\x80\x98propterea dabo mulieres eorum\r\nexteris\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I will give their women to strangers, that is to the Templar,\r\nas in the present matter; \xe2\x80\x98et thesauros eorum haeredibus alienis\xe2\x80\x99, and\r\ntheir treasures to others\xe2\x80\x94as in the present case to these honest\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac groaned deeply, and began to wring his hands, and to relapse into\r\nhis state of desolation and despair. But the leader of the yeomen led\r\nhim aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdvise thee well, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat thou wilt do in this\r\nmatter; my counsel to thee is to make a friend of this churchman. He is\r\nvain, Isaac, and he is covetous; at least he needs money to supply his\r\nprofusion. Thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that I am\r\nblinded by thy pretexts of poverty. I am intimately acquainted, Isaac,\r\nwith the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags\xe2\x80\x94What!\r\nknow I not the great stone beneath the apple-tree, that leads into the\r\nvaulted chamber under thy garden at York?\xe2\x80\x9d The Jew grew as pale as\r\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut fear nothing from me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we are of\r\nold acquainted. Dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair\r\ndaughter Rebecca redeemed from the gyves at York, and kept him in thy\r\nhouse till his health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him\r\nrecovered, and with a piece of money?\xe2\x80\x94Usurer as thou art, thou didst\r\nnever place coin at better interest than that poor silver mark, for it\r\nhas this day saved thee five hundred crowns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou art he whom we called Diccon Bend-the-Bow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought ever I knew the accent of thy voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Bend-the-Bow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand Locksley, and have a good\r\nname besides all these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou art mistaken, good Bend-the-Bow, concerning that same vaulted\r\napartment. So help me Heaven, as there is nought in it but some\r\nmerchandises which I will gladly part with to you\xe2\x80\x94one hundred yards of\r\nLincoln green to make doublets to thy men, and a hundred staves of\r\nSpanish yew to make bows, and a hundred silken bowstrings, tough,\r\nround, and sound\xe2\x80\x94these will I send thee for thy good-will, honest\r\nDiccon, an thou wilt keep silence about the vault, my good Diccon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilent as a dormouse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cand never trust me but I am\r\ngrieved for thy daughter. But I may not help it\xe2\x80\x94The Templars lances are\r\ntoo strong for my archery in the open field\xe2\x80\x94they would scatter us like\r\ndust. Had I but known it was Rebecca when she was borne off, something\r\nmight have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. Come,\r\nshall I treat for thee with the Prior?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn God\xe2\x80\x99s name, Diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of\r\nmy bosom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nOutlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will deal with him in thy behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then turned from the Jew, who followed him, however, as closely as\r\nhis shadow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrior Aymer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9ccome apart with me under this tree.\r\nMen say thou dost love wine, and a lady\xe2\x80\x99s smile, better than beseems\r\nthy Order, Sir Priest; but with that I have nought to do. I have heard,\r\ntoo, thou dost love a brace of good dogs and a fleet horse, and it may\r\nwell be that, loving things which are costly to come by, thou hatest\r\nnot a purse of gold. But I have never heard that thou didst love\r\noppression or cruelty.\xe2\x80\x94Now, here is Isaac willing to give thee the\r\nmeans of pleasure and pastime in a bag containing one hundred marks of\r\nsilver, if thy intercession with thine ally the Templar shall avail to\r\nprocure the freedom of his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn safety and honour, as when taken from me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\r\nit is no bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Isaac,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cor I give up thine interest.\xe2\x80\x94What say\r\nyou to this my purpose, Prior Aymer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cis of a mixed condition; for, if I do a\r\ngood deal on the one hand, yet, on the other, it goeth to the vantage\r\nof a Jew, and in so much is against my conscience. Yet, if the\r\nIsraelite will advantage the Church by giving me somewhat over to the\r\nbuilding of our dortour, 45 I will take it on my conscience to aid him\r\nin the matter of his daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a score of marks to the dortour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBe still, I\r\nsay, Isaac!\xe2\x80\x94or for a brace of silver candlesticks to the altar, we will\r\nnot stand with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but, good Diccon Bend-the-Bow\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Isaac, endeavouring to\r\ninterpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Jew\xe2\x80\x94good beast\xe2\x80\x94good earthworm!\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman, losing patience;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can thou dost go on to put thy filthy lucre in the balance with thy\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s life and honour, by Heaven, I will strip thee of every\r\nmaravedi thou hast in the world, before three days are out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac shrunk together, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what pledge am I to have for all this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Isaac returns successful through your mediation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nOutlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cI swear by Saint Hubert, I will see that he pays thee the\r\nmoney in good silver, or I will reckon with him for it in such sort, he\r\nhad better have paid twenty such sums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aymer, \xe2\x80\x9csince I must needs meddle in this\r\nmatter, let me have the use of thy writing-tablets\xe2\x80\x94though, hold\xe2\x80\x94rather\r\nthan use thy pen, I would fast for twenty-four hours, and where shall I\r\nfind one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your holy scruples can dispense with using the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s tablets, for\r\nthe pen I can find a remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman; and, bending his bow, he\r\naimed his shaft at a wild-goose which was soaring over their heads, the\r\nadvanced-guard of a phalanx of his tribe, which were winging their way\r\nto the distant and solitary fens of Holderness. The bird came\r\nfluttering down, transfixed with the arrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9care quills enow to supply all the\r\nmonks of Jorvaulx for the next hundred years, an they take not to\r\nwriting chronicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Prior sat down, and at great leisure indited an epistle to Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, and having carefully sealed up the tablets, delivered\r\nthem to the Jew, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis will be thy safe-conduct to the\r\nPreceptory of Templestowe, and, as I think, is most likely to\r\naccomplish the delivery of thy daughter, if it be well backed with\r\nproffers of advantage and commodity at thine own hand; for, trust me\r\nwell, the good Knight Bois-Guilbert is of their confraternity that do\r\nnought for nought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cI will detain thee no longer here than\r\nto give the Jew a quittance for the six hundred crowns at which thy\r\nransom is fixed\xe2\x80\x94I accept of him for my pay-master; and if I hear that\r\nye boggle at allowing him in his accompts the sum so paid by him, Saint\r\nMary refuse me, an I burn not the abbey over thine head, though I hang\r\nten years the sooner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a much worse grace than that wherewith he had penned the letter to\r\nBois-Guilbert, the Prior wrote an acquittance, discharging Isaac of\r\nYork of six hundred crowns, advanced to him in his need for acquittal\r\nof his ransom, and faithfully promising to hold true compt with him for\r\nthat sum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prior Aymer, \xe2\x80\x9cI will pray you of restitution of my\r\nmules and palfreys, and the freedom of the reverend brethren attending\r\nupon me, and also of the gymmal rings, jewels, and fair vestures, of\r\nwhich I have been despoiled, having now satisfied you for my ransom as\r\na true prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouching your brethren, Sir Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley, \xe2\x80\x9cthey shall have\r\npresent freedom, it were unjust to detain them; touching your horses\r\nand mules, they shall also be restored, with such spending-money as may\r\nenable you to reach York, for it were cruel to deprive you of the means\r\nof journeying.\xe2\x80\x94But as concerning rings, jewels, chains, and what else,\r\nyou must understand that we are men of tender consciences, and will not\r\nyield to a venerable man like yourself, who should be dead to the\r\nvanities of this life, the strong temptation to break the rule of his\r\nfoundation, by wearing rings, chains, or other vain gauds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink what you do, my masters,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cere you put your hand\r\non the Church\xe2\x80\x99s patrimony\xe2\x80\x94These things are \xe2\x80\x98inter res sacras\xe2\x80\x99, and I\r\nwot not what judgment might ensue were they to be handled by laical\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take care of that, reverend Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Hermit of\r\nCopmanhurst; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I will wear them myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend, or brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, in answer to this solution of his\r\ndoubts, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou hast really taken religious orders, I pray thee to\r\nlook how thou wilt answer to thine official for the share thou hast\r\ntaken in this day\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Prior,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to know that I belong to\r\na little diocese, where I am my own diocesan, and care as little for\r\nthe Bishop of York as I do for the Abbot of Jorvaulx, the Prior, and\r\nall the convent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art utterly irregular,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior; \xe2\x80\x9cone of those disorderly\r\nmen, who, taking on them the sacred character without due cause,\r\nprofane the holy rites, and endanger the souls of those who take\r\ncounsel at their hands; \xe2\x80\x98lapides pro pane condonantes iis\xe2\x80\x99, giving them\r\nstones instead of bread as the Vulgate hath it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9can my brain-pan could have been broken by\r\nLatin, it had not held so long together.\xe2\x80\x94I say, that easing a world of\r\nsuch misproud priests as thou art of their jewels and their gimcracks,\r\nis a lawful spoiling of the Egyptians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou be\xe2\x80\x99st a hedge-priest,\xe2\x80\x9d 46 said the Prior, in great wrath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98excommunicabo vos\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou be\xe2\x80\x99st thyself more like a thief and a heretic,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar,\r\nequally indignant; \xe2\x80\x9cI will pouch up no such affront before my\r\nparishioners, as thou thinkest it not shame to put upon me, although I\r\nbe a reverend brother to thee. \xe2\x80\x98Ossa ejus perfringam\xe2\x80\x99, I will break\r\nyour bones, as the Vulgate hath it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHola!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9ccome the reverend brethren to such\r\nterms?\xe2\x80\x94Keep thine assurance of peace, Friar.\xe2\x80\x94Prior, an thou hast not\r\nmade thy peace perfect with God, provoke the Friar no further.\xe2\x80\x94Hermit,\r\nlet the reverend father depart in peace, as a ransomed man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe yeomen separated the incensed priests, who continued to raise their\r\nvoices, vituperating each other in bad Latin, which the Prior delivered\r\nthe more fluently, and the Hermit with the greater vehemence. The Prior\r\nat length recollected himself sufficiently to be aware that he was\r\ncompromising his dignity, by squabbling with such a hedge-priest as the\r\nOutlaw\xe2\x80\x99s chaplain, and being joined by his attendants, rode off with\r\nconsiderably less pomp, and in a much more apostolical condition, so\r\nfar as worldly matters were concerned, than he had exhibited before\r\nthis rencounter.\r\n\r\nIt remained that the Jew should produce some security for the ransom\r\nwhich he was to pay on the Prior\xe2\x80\x99s account, as well as upon his own. He\r\ngave, accordingly, an order sealed with his signet, to a brother of his\r\ntribe at York, requiring him to pay to the bearer the sum of a thousand\r\ncrowns, and to deliver certain merchandises specified in the note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother Sheva,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, groaning deeply, \xe2\x80\x9chath the key of my\r\nwarehouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of the vaulted chamber,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Locksley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94may Heaven forefend!\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cevil is the hour that let\r\nany one whomsoever into that secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is safe with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cso be that this thy scroll\r\nproduce the sum therein nominated and set down.\xe2\x80\x94But what now, Isaac?\r\nart dead? art stupefied? hath the payment of a thousand crowns put thy\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s peril out of thy mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew started to his feet\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Diccon, no\xe2\x80\x94I will presently set\r\nforth.\xe2\x80\x94Farewell, thou whom I may not call good, and dare not and will\r\nnot call evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYet ere Isaac departed, the Outlaw Chief bestowed on him this parting\r\nadvice:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBe liberal of thine offers, Isaac, and spare not thy purse for\r\nthy daughter\xe2\x80\x99s safety. Credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in her\r\ncause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured\r\nmolten down thy throat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey,\r\naccompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at\r\nthe same time his guards, through the wood.\r\n\r\nThe Black Knight, who had seen with no small interest these various\r\nproceedings, now took his leave of the Outlaw in turn; nor could he\r\navoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil\r\npolicy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and\r\ninfluence of the laws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood fruit, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cwill sometimes grow on a\r\nsorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and\r\nunmixed. Amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there\r\nare, doubtless, numbers who wish to exercise its license with some\r\nmoderation, and some who regret, it may be, that they are obliged to\r\nfollow such a trade at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to one of those,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI am now, I presume,\r\nspeaking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have each our secret. You are\r\nwelcome to form your judgment of me, and I may use my conjectures\r\ntouching you, though neither of our shafts may hit the mark they are\r\nshot at. But as I do not pray to be admitted into your mystery, be not\r\noffended that I preserve my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crave pardon, brave Outlaw,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cyour reproof is just.\r\nBut it may be we shall meet hereafter with less of concealment on\r\neither side.\xe2\x80\x94Meanwhile we part friends, do we not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is my hand upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Locksley; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will call it the hand\r\nof a true Englishman, though an outlaw for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is mine in return,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hold it honoured\r\nby being clasped with yours. For he that does good, having the\r\nunlimited power to do evil, deserves praise not only for the good which\r\nhe performs, but for the evil which he forbears. Fare thee well,\r\ngallant Outlaw!\xe2\x80\x9d Thus parted that fair fellowship; and He of the\r\nFetterlock, mounting upon his strong war-horse, rode off through the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nKING JOHN.\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee what, my friend,\r\nHe is a very serpent in my way;\r\nAnd wheresoe\xe2\x80\x99er this foot of mine doth tread,\r\nHe lies before me.\xe2\x80\x94Dost thou understand me?\r\n\r\n\r\nKING JOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was brave feasting in the Castle of York, to which Prince John\r\nhad invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he\r\nhoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthrone. Waldemar Fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret\r\nwork among them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was\r\nnecessary in making an open declaration of their purpose. But their\r\nenterprise was delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the\r\nconfederacy. The stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf; the buoyant spirits and bold bearing of De Bracy; the\r\nsagacity, martial experience, and renowned valour of Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, were important to the success of their conspiracy; and,\r\nwhile cursing in secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence,\r\nneither John nor his adviser dared to proceed without them. Isaac the\r\nJew also seemed to have vanished, and with him the hope of certain sums\r\nof money, making up the subsidy for which Prince John had contracted\r\nwith that Israelite and his brethren. This deficiency was likely to\r\nprove perilous in an emergency so critical.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning after the fall of Torquilstone, that a confused\r\nreport began to spread abroad in the city of York, that De Bracy and\r\nBois-Guilbert, with their confederate Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, had been taken or\r\nslain. Waldemar brought the rumour to Prince John, announcing, that he\r\nfeared its truth the more that they had set out with a small\r\nattendance, for the purpose of committing an assault on the Saxon\r\nCedric and his attendants. At another time the Prince would have\r\ntreated this deed of violence as a good jest; but now, that it\r\ninterfered with and impeded his own plans, he exclaimed against the\r\nperpetrators, and spoke of the broken laws, and the infringement of\r\npublic order and of private property, in a tone which might have become\r\nKing Alfred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unprincipled marauders,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwere I ever to become monarch of\r\nEngland, I would hang such transgressors over the drawbridges of their\r\nown castles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to become monarch of England,\xe2\x80\x9d said his Ahithophel coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\nnecessary not only that your Grace should endure the transgressions of\r\nthese unprincipled marauders, but that you should afford them your\r\nprotection, notwithstanding your laudable zeal for the laws they are in\r\nthe habit of infringing. We shall be finely helped, if the churl Saxons\r\nshould have realized your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s vision, of converting feudal\r\ndrawbridges into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited Cedric seemeth one\r\nto whom such an imagination might occur. Your Grace is well aware, it\r\nwill be dangerous to stir without Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, De Bracy, and the\r\nTemplar; and yet we have gone too far to recede with safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to\r\nstride up and down the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe villains,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe base treacherous villains, to desert me\r\nat this pinch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\r\nmust be toying with follies when such business was in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince, stopping short before Waldemar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing which can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his counsellor, \xe2\x80\x9csave that\r\nwhich I have already taken order for.\xe2\x80\x94I came not to bewail this evil\r\nchance with your Grace, until I had done my best to remedy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art ever my better angel, Waldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince; \xe2\x80\x9cand when I\r\nhave such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of John will be\r\nrenowned in our annals.\xe2\x80\x94What hast thou commanded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have ordered Louis Winkelbrand, De Bracy\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenant, to cause his\r\ntrumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently\r\nforth towards the castle of Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf, to do what yet may be done\r\nfor the succour of our friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has\r\nundergone what it conceives to be an insult. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the face of God!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWaldemar Fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over\r\nmalapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in\r\na town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crave your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, internally cursing the\r\nidle vanity of his patron; \xe2\x80\x9cbut when time pressed, and even the loss of\r\nminutes might be fatal, I judged it best to take this much burden upon\r\nme, in a matter of such importance to your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art pardoned, Fitzurse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cthy purpose\r\nhath atoned for thy hasty rashness.\xe2\x80\x94But whom have we here?\xe2\x80\x94De Bracy\r\nhimself, by the rood!\xe2\x80\x94and in strange guise doth he come before us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed De Bracy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being broken,\r\ndefaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay\r\nand dust from the crest to the spur. Undoing his helmet, he placed it\r\non the table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he\r\ntold his news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat means this?\xe2\x80\x94Speak, I charge\r\nthee!\xe2\x80\x94Are the Saxons in rebellion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, De Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his\r\nmaster, \xe2\x80\x9cthou wert wont to be a man\xe2\x80\x94Where is the Templar?\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Templar is fled,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf you will never see\r\nmore. He has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own\r\ncastle and I alone am escaped to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold news,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar, \xe2\x80\x9cto us, though you speak of fire and\r\nconflagration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst news is not yet said,\xe2\x80\x9d answered De Bracy; and, coming up to\r\nPrince John, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRichard is in\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94I have seen and spoken with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrince John turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken\r\nbench to support himself\xe2\x80\x94much like to a man who receives an arrow in\r\nhis bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou ravest, De Bracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cit cannot be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as true as truth itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI was his prisoner,\r\nand spoke with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Richard Plantagenet, sayest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Fitzurse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Richard Plantagenet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwith Richard\r\nC\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion\xe2\x80\x94with Richard of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou wert his prisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar; \xe2\x80\x9che is then at the head of\r\na power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94only a few outlawed yeomen were around him, and to these his person\r\nis unknown. I heard him say he was about to depart from them. He joined\r\nthem only to assist at the storming of Torquilstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9csuch is indeed the fashion of Richard\xe2\x80\x94a true\r\nknight-errant he, and will wander in wild adventure, trusting the\r\nprowess of his single arm, like any Sir Guy or Sir Bevis, while the\r\nweighty affairs of his kingdom slumber, and his own safety is\r\nendangered.\xe2\x80\x94What dost thou propose to do De Bracy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x94I offered Richard the service of my Free Lances, and he refused\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94I will lead them to Hull, seize on shipping, and embark for\r\nFlanders; thanks to the bustling times, a man of action will always\r\nfind employment. And thou, Waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield,\r\nand lay down thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate\r\nwhich God sends us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too old, Maurice, and I have a daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Waldemar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive her to me, Fitzurse, and I will maintain her as fits her rank,\r\nwith the help of lance and stirrup,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Fitzurse; \xe2\x80\x9cI will take sanctuary in this church of\r\nSaint Peter\xe2\x80\x94the Archbishop is my sworn brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this discourse, Prince John had gradually awakened from the\r\nstupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence,\r\nand had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his\r\nfollowers. \xe2\x80\x9cThey fall off from me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthey hold no\r\nmore by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x94Hell and fiends! can I shape no means for myself when I am deserted\r\nby these cravens?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94He paused, and there was an expression of diabolical\r\npassion in the constrained laugh with which he at length broke in on\r\ntheir conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha! my good lords, by the light of Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s brow, I held ye\r\nsage men, bold men, ready-witted men; yet ye throw down wealth, honour,\r\npleasure, all that our noble game promised you, at the moment it might\r\nbe won by one bold cast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you not,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as Richard\xe2\x80\x99s return is\r\nblown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over\r\nwith us. I would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to France or take\r\nthe protection of the Queen Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seek no safety for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, haughtily; \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\ncould secure by a word spoken to my brother. But although you, De\r\nBracy, and you, Waldemar Fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, I should\r\nnot greatly delight to see your heads blackening on Clifford\xe2\x80\x99s gate\r\nyonder. Thinkest thou, Waldemar, that the wily Archbishop will not\r\nsuffer thee to be taken from the very horns of the altar, would it make\r\nhis peace with King Richard? And forgettest thou, De Bracy, that Robert\r\nEstoteville lies betwixt thee and Hull with all his forces, and that\r\nthe Earl of Essex is gathering his followers? If we had reason to fear\r\nthese levies even before Richard\xe2\x80\x99s return, trowest thou there is any\r\ndoubt now which party their leaders will take? Trust me, Estoteville\r\nalone has strength enough to drive all thy Free Lances into the\r\nHumber.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Waldemar Fitzurse and De Bracy looked in each other\xe2\x80\x99s faces\r\nwith blank dismay.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one road to safety,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nPrince, and his brow grew black as midnight; \xe2\x80\x9cthis object of our terror\r\njourneys alone\xe2\x80\x94He must be met withal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by me,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, hastily; \xe2\x80\x9cI was his prisoner, and he took\r\nme to mercy. I will not harm a feather in his crest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho spoke of harming him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, with a hardened laugh;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe knave will say next that I meant he should slay him!\xe2\x80\x94No\xe2\x80\x94a prison\r\nwere better; and whether in Britain or Austria, what matters it?\xe2\x80\x94Things\r\nwill be but as they were when we commenced our enterprise\xe2\x80\x94It was\r\nfounded on the hope that Richard would remain a captive in Germany\xe2\x80\x94Our\r\nuncle Robert lived and died in the castle of Cardiffe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar, \xe2\x80\x9cyour sire Henry sate more firm in his seat\r\nthan your Grace can. I say the best prison is that which is made by the\r\nsexton\xe2\x80\x94no dungeon like a church-vault! I have said my say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrison or tomb,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cI wash my hands of the whole matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVillain!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cthou wouldst not bewray our counsel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCounsel was never bewrayed by me,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cnor must\r\nthe name of villain be coupled with mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, Sir Knight!\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar; \xe2\x80\x9cand you, good my lord, forgive the\r\nscruples of valiant De Bracy; I trust I shall soon remove them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat passes your eloquence, Fitzurse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, good Sir Maurice,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the wily politician, \xe2\x80\x9cstart not aside\r\nlike a scared steed, without, at least, considering the object of your\r\nterror.\xe2\x80\x94This Richard\xe2\x80\x94but a day since, and it would have been thy\r\ndearest wish to have met him hand to hand in the ranks of battle\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhundred times I have heard thee wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that was as thou sayest, hand to hand, and in\r\nthe ranks of battle! Thou never heardest me breathe a thought of\r\nassaulting him alone, and in a forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art no good knight if thou dost scruple at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it in battle that Lancelot de Lac and Sir Tristram won renown? or\r\nwas it not by encountering gigantic knights under the shade of deep and\r\nunknown forests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but I promise you,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cthat neither Tristram nor\r\nLancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for Richard Plantagenet,\r\nand I think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art mad, De Bracy\xe2\x80\x94what is it we propose to thee, a hired and\r\nretained captain of Free Companions, whose swords are purchased for\r\nPrince John\xe2\x80\x99s service? Thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou\r\nscruplest, though thy patron\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine\r\nown, and the life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, sullenly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he gave me my life. True,\r\nhe sent me from his presence, and refused my homage\xe2\x80\x94so far I owe him\r\nneither favour nor allegiance\xe2\x80\x94but I will not lift hand against him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt needs not\xe2\x80\x94send Louis Winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe have sufficient ruffians of your own,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cnot one of\r\nmine shall budge on such an errand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArt thou so obstinate, De Bracy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John; \xe2\x80\x9cand wilt thou\r\nforsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it not,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy; \xe2\x80\x9cI will abide by you in aught that\r\nbecomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway\r\npractice comes not within my vow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome hither, Waldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John. \xe2\x80\x9cAn unhappy prince am I. My\r\nfather, King Henry, had faithful servants\xe2\x80\x94He had but to say that he was\r\nplagued with a factious priest, and the blood of Thomas-a-Becket, saint\r\nthough he was, stained the steps of his own altar.\xe2\x80\x94Tracy, Morville,\r\nBrito 47 loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are\r\nextinct! and although Reginald Fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen\r\noff from his father\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity and courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has fallen off from neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Waldemar Fitzurse; \xe2\x80\x9cand since it\r\nmay not better be, I will take on me the conduct of this perilous\r\nenterprise. Dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a\r\nzealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to Henry fall far\r\nshort of what I am about to afford; for rather would I assail a whole\r\ncalendar of saints, than put spear in rest against C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion.\xe2\x80\x94De\r\nBracy, to thee I must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and\r\nto guard Prince John\xe2\x80\x99s person. If you receive such news as I trust to\r\nsend you, our enterprise will no longer wear a doubtful aspect.\xe2\x80\x94Page,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9chie to my lodgings, and tell my armourer to be there in\r\nreadiness; and bid Stephen Wetheral, Broad Thoresby, and the Three\r\nSpears of Spyinghow, come to me instantly; and let the scout-master,\r\nHugh Bardon, attend me also.\xe2\x80\x94Adieu, my Prince, till better times.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus\r\nspeaking, he left the apartment. \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes to make my brother prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Prince John to De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cwith as little touch of compunction, as\r\nif it but concerned the liberty of a Saxon franklin. I trust he will\r\nobserve our orders, and use our dear Richard\xe2\x80\x99s person with all due\r\nrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Bracy only answered by a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the light of Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s brow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, \xe2\x80\x9cour orders to him\r\nwere most precise\xe2\x80\x94though it may be you heard them not, as we stood\r\ntogether in the oriel window\xe2\x80\x94Most clear and positive was our charge\r\nthat Richard\xe2\x80\x99s safety should be cared for, and woe to Waldemar\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nif he transgress it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better pass to his lodgings,\xe2\x80\x9d said De Bracy, \xe2\x80\x9cand make him fully\r\naware of your Grace\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my ear, it may\r\nnot perchance have reached that of Waldemar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI promise thee he heard me;\r\nand, besides, I have farther occupation for thee. Maurice, come hither;\r\nlet me lean on thy shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and\r\nPrince John, with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat thinkest thou of this Waldemar Fitzurse, my De Bracy?\xe2\x80\x94He\r\ntrusts to be our Chancellor. Surely we will pause ere we give an office\r\nso high to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood,\r\nby his so readily undertaking this enterprise against Richard. Thou\r\ndost think, I warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by\r\nthy boldly declining this unpleasing task\xe2\x80\x94But no, Maurice! I rather\r\nhonour thee for thy virtuous constancy. There are things most necessary\r\nto be done, the perpetrator of which we neither love nor honour; and\r\nthere may be refusals to serve us, which shall rather exalt in our\r\nestimation those who deny our request. The arrest of my unfortunate\r\nbrother forms no such good title to the high office of Chancellor, as\r\nthy chivalrous and courageous denial establishes in thee to the\r\ntruncheon of High Marshal. Think of this, De Bracy, and begone to thy\r\ncharge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFickle tyrant!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered De Bracy, as he left the presence of the\r\nPrince; \xe2\x80\x9cevil luck have they who trust thee. Thy Chancellor, indeed!\xe2\x80\x94He\r\nwho hath the keeping of thy conscience shall have an easy charge, I\r\ntrow. But High Marshal of England! that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, extending his arm,\r\nas if to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along\r\nthe antechamber, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is indeed a prize worth playing for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDe Bracy had no sooner left the apartment than Prince John summoned an\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBid Hugh Bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall\r\nhave spoken with Waldemar Fitzurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which John\r\ntraversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did Waldemar desire of thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and\r\nskilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou hast fitted him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet your grace never trust me else,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the master of the spies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne is from Hexamshire; he is wont to trace the Tynedale and\r\nTeviotdale thieves, as a bloodhound follows the slot of a hurt deer.\r\nThe other is Yorkshire bred, and has twanged his bowstring right oft in\r\nmerry Sherwood; he knows each glade and dingle, copse and high-wood,\r\nbetwixt this and Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prince.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGoes Waldemar forth with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bardon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith what attendance?\xe2\x80\x9d asked John, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroad Thoresby goes with him, and Wetheral, whom they call, for his\r\ncruelty, Stephen Steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that\r\nbelonged to Ralph Middleton\xe2\x80\x99s gang\xe2\x80\x94they are called the Spears of\r\nSpyinghow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John; then added, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on\r\nMaurice De Bracy\xe2\x80\x94so that he shall not observe it, however\xe2\x80\x94And let us\r\nknow of his motions from time to time\xe2\x80\x94with whom he converses, what he\r\nproposeth. Fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHugh Bardon bowed, and retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Maurice betrays me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince John\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif he betrays me, as his\r\nbearing leads me to fear, I will have his head, were Richard thundering\r\nat the gates of York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nArouse the tiger of Hyrcanian deserts,\r\nStrive with the half-starved lion for his prey;\r\nLesser the risk, than rouse the slumbering fire\r\nOf wild Fanaticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nANONYMUS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur tale now returns to Isaac of York.\xe2\x80\x94Mounted upon a mule, the gift of\r\nthe Outlaw, with two tall yeomen to act as his guard and guides, the\r\nJew had set out for the Preceptory of Templestowe, for the purpose of\r\nnegotiating his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s redemption. The Preceptory was but a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney from the demolished castle of Torquilstone, and the Jew had\r\nhoped to reach it before nightfall; accordingly, having dismissed his\r\nguides at the verge of the forest, and rewarded them with a piece of\r\nsilver, he began to press on with such speed as his weariness permitted\r\nhim to exert. But his strength failed him totally ere he had reached\r\nwithin four miles of the Temple-Court; racking pains shot along his\r\nback and through his limbs, and the excessive anguish which he felt at\r\nheart being now augmented by bodily suffering, he was rendered\r\naltogether incapable of proceeding farther than a small market-town,\r\nwere dwelt a Jewish Rabbi of his tribe, eminent in the medical\r\nprofession, and to whom Isaac was well known. Nathan Ben Israel\r\nreceived his suffering countryman with that kindness which the law\r\nprescribed, and which the Jews practised to each other. He insisted on\r\nhis betaking himself to repose, and used such remedies as were then in\r\nmost repute to check the progress of the fever, which terror, fatigue,\r\nill usage, and sorrow, had brought upon the poor old Jew.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, when Isaac proposed to arise and pursue his journey,\r\nNathan remonstrated against his purpose, both as his host and as his\r\nphysician. It might cost him, he said, his life. But Isaac replied,\r\nthat more than life and death depended upon his going that morning to\r\nTemplestowe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Templestowe!\xe2\x80\x9d said his host with surprise again felt his pulse, and\r\nthen muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHis fever is abated, yet seems his mind\r\nsomewhat alienated and disturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not to Templestowe?\xe2\x80\x9d answered his patient. \xe2\x80\x9cI grant thee,\r\nNathan, that it is a dwelling of those to whom the despised Children of\r\nthe Promise are a stumbling-block and an abomination; yet thou knowest\r\nthat pressing affairs of traffic sometimes carry us among these\r\nbloodthirsty Nazarene soldiers, and that we visit the Preceptories of\r\nthe Templars, as well as the Commanderies of the Knights Hospitallers,\r\nas they are called.\xe2\x80\x9d 48\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nathan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut wottest thou that Lucas de\r\nBeaumanoir, the chief of their Order, and whom they term Grand Master,\r\nis now himself at Templestowe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cour last letters from our brethren at\r\nParis advised us that he was at that city, beseeching Philip for aid\r\nagainst the Sultan Saladine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hath since come to England, unexpected by his brethren,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben\r\nIsrael; \xe2\x80\x9cand he cometh among them with a strong and outstretched arm to\r\ncorrect and to punish. His countenance is kindled in anger against\r\nthose who have departed from the vow which they have made, and great is\r\nthe fear of those sons of Belial. Thou must have heard of his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well known unto me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Gentiles deliver this\r\nLucas Beaumanoir as a man zealous to slaying for every point of the\r\nNazarene law; and our brethren have termed him a fierce destroyer of\r\nthe Saracens, and a cruel tyrant to the Children of the Promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd truly have they termed him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nathan the physician. \xe2\x80\x9cOther\r\nTemplars may be moved from the purpose of their heart by pleasure, or\r\nbribed by promise of gold and silver; but Beaumanoir is of a different\r\nstamp\xe2\x80\x94hating sensuality, despising treasure, and pressing forward to\r\nthat which they call the crown of martyrdom\xe2\x80\x94The God of Jacob speedily\r\nsend it unto him, and unto them all! Specially hath this proud man\r\nextended his glove over the children of Judah, as holy David over Edom,\r\nholding the murder of a Jew to be an offering of as sweet savour as the\r\ndeath of a Saracen. Impious and false things has he said even of the\r\nvirtues of our medicines, as if they were the devices of Satan\xe2\x80\x94The Lord\r\nrebuke him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cI must present myself at Templestowe,\r\nthough he hath made his face like unto a fiery furnace seven times\r\nheated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then explained to Nathan the pressing cause of his journey. The\r\nRabbi listened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the\r\nfashion of his people, rending his clothes, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my\r\ndaughter!\xe2\x80\x94ah, my daughter!\xe2\x80\x94Alas! for the beauty of Zion!\xe2\x80\x94Alas! for the\r\ncaptivity of Israel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou seest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9chow it stands with me, and that I may not\r\ntarry. Peradventure, the presence of this Lucas Beaumanoir, being the\r\nchief man over them, may turn Brian de Bois-Guilbert from the ill which\r\nhe doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter\r\nRebecca.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo thou,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nathan Ben Israel, \xe2\x80\x9cand be wise, for wisdom availed\r\nDaniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well\r\nwith thee, even as thine heart wisheth. Yet, if thou canst, keep thee\r\nfrom the presence of the Grand Master, for to do foul scorn to our\r\npeople is his morning and evening delight. It may be if thou couldst\r\nspeak with Bois-Guilbert in private, thou shalt the better prevail with\r\nhim; for men say that these accursed Nazarenes are not of one mind in\r\nthe Preceptory\xe2\x80\x94May their counsels be confounded and brought to shame!\r\nBut do thou, brother, return to me as if it were to the house of thy\r\nfather, and bring me word how it has sped with thee; and well do I hope\r\nthou wilt bring with thee Rebecca, even the scholar of the wise Miriam,\r\nwhose cures the Gentiles slandered as if they had been wrought by\r\nnecromancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hour\xe2\x80\x99s riding\r\nbrought him before the Preceptory of Templestowe.\r\n\r\nThis establishment of the Templars was seated amidst fair meadows and\r\npastures, which the devotion of the former Preceptor had bestowed upon\r\ntheir Order. It was strong and well fortified, a point never neglected\r\nby these knights, and which the disordered state of England rendered\r\npeculiarly necessary. Two halberdiers, clad in black, guarded the\r\ndrawbridge, and others, in the same sad livery, glided to and fro upon\r\nthe walls with a funereal pace, resembling spectres more than soldiers.\r\nThe inferior officers of the Order were thus dressed, ever since their\r\nuse of white garments, similar to those of the knights and esquires,\r\nhad given rise to a combination of certain false brethren in the\r\nmountains of Palestine, terming themselves Templars, and bringing great\r\ndishonour on the Order. A knight was now and then seen to cross the\r\ncourt in his long white cloak, his head depressed on his breast, and\r\nhis arms folded. They passed each other, if they chanced to meet, with\r\na slow, solemn, and mute greeting; for such was the rule of their\r\nOrder, quoting thereupon the holy texts, \xe2\x80\x9cIn many words thou shalt not\r\navoid sin,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLife and death are in the power of the tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d In a\r\nword, the stern ascetic rigour of the Temple discipline, which had been\r\nso long exchanged for prodigal and licentious indulgence, seemed at\r\nonce to have revived at Templestowe under the severe eye of Lucas\r\nBeaumanoir.\r\n\r\nIsaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the\r\nmanner most likely to bespeak favour; for he was well aware, that to\r\nhis unhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the Order was not less\r\ndangerous than their unprincipled licentiousness; and that his religion\r\nwould be the object of hate and persecution in the one case, as his\r\nwealth would have exposed him in the other to the extortions of\r\nunrelenting oppression.\r\n\r\nMeantime Lucas Beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging to the\r\nPreceptory, included within the precincts of its exterior\r\nfortification, and held sad and confidential communication with a\r\nbrother of his Order, who had come in his company from Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master was a man advanced in age, as was testified by his\r\nlong grey beard, and the shaggy grey eyebrows overhanging eyes, of\r\nwhich, however, years had been unable to quench the fire. A formidable\r\nwarrior, his thin and severe features retained the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s fierceness\r\nof expression; an ascetic bigot, they were no less marked by the\r\nemaciation of abstinence, and the spiritual pride of the self-satisfied\r\ndevotee. Yet with these severer traits of physiognomy, there was mixed\r\nsomewhat striking and noble, arising, doubtless, from the great part\r\nwhich his high office called upon him to act among monarchs and\r\nprinces, and from the habitual exercise of supreme authority over the\r\nvaliant and high-born knights, who were united by the rules of the\r\nOrder. His stature was tall, and his gait, undepressed by age and toil,\r\nwas erect and stately. His white mantle was shaped with severe\r\nregularity, according to the rule of Saint Bernard himself, being\r\ncomposed of what was then called Burrel cloth, exactly fitted to the\r\nsize of the wearer, and bearing on the left shoulder the octangular\r\ncross peculiar to the Order, formed of red cloth. No vair or ermine\r\ndecked this garment; but in respect of his age, the Grand Master, as\r\npermitted by the rules, wore his doublet lined and trimmed with the\r\nsoftest lambskin, dressed with the wool outwards, which was the nearest\r\napproach he could regularly make to the use of fur, then the greatest\r\nluxury of dress. In his hand he bore that singular \xe2\x80\x9cabacus\xe2\x80\x9d, or staff\r\nof office, with which Templars are usually represented, having at the\r\nupper end a round plate, on which was engraved the cross of the Order,\r\ninscribed within a circle or orle, as heralds term it. His companion,\r\nwho attended on this great personage, had nearly the same dress in all\r\nrespects, but his extreme deference towards his Superior showed that no\r\nother equality subsisted between them. The Preceptor, for such he was\r\nin rank, walked not in a line with the Grand Master, but just so far\r\nbehind that Beaumanoir could speak to him without turning round his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConrade,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cdear companion of my battles and my\r\ntoils, to thy faithful bosom alone I can confide my sorrows. To thee\r\nalone can I tell how oft, since I came to this kingdom, I have desired\r\nto be dissolved and to be with the just. Not one object in England hath\r\nmet mine eye which it could rest upon with pleasure, save the tombs of\r\nour brethren, beneath the massive roof of our Temple Church in yonder\r\nproud capital. O, valiant Robert de Ros! did I exclaim internally, as I\r\ngazed upon these good soldiers of the cross, where they lie sculptured\r\non their sepulchres,\xe2\x80\x94O, worthy William de Mareschal! open your marble\r\ncells, and take to your repose a weary brother, who would rather strive\r\nwith a hundred thousand pagans than witness the decay of our Holy\r\nOrder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is but true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Conrade Mont-Fitchet; \xe2\x80\x9cit is but too true;\r\nand the irregularities of our brethren in England are even more gross\r\nthan those in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they are more wealthy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Grand Master. \xe2\x80\x9cBear with\r\nme, brother, although I should something vaunt myself. Thou knowest the\r\nlife I have led, keeping each point of my Order, striving with devils\r\nembodied and disembodied, striking down the roaring lion, who goeth\r\nabout seeking whom he may devour, like a good knight and devout priest,\r\nwheresoever I met with him\xe2\x80\x94even as blessed Saint Bernard hath\r\nprescribed to us in the forty-fifth capital of our rule, \xe2\x80\x98Ut Leo semper\r\nferiatur\xe2\x80\x99. 49\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by the Holy Temple! the zeal which hath devoured my substance and\r\nmy life, yea, the very nerves and marrow of my bones; by that very Holy\r\nTemple I swear to thee, that save thyself and some few that still\r\nretain the ancient severity of our Order, I look upon no brethren whom\r\nI can bring my soul to embrace under that holy name. What say our\r\nstatutes, and how do our brethren observe them? They should wear no\r\nvain or worldly ornament, no crest upon their helmet, no gold upon\r\nstirrup or bridle-bit; yet who now go pranked out so proudly and so\r\ngaily as the poor soldiers of the Temple? They are forbidden by our\r\nstatutes to take one bird by means of another, to shoot beasts with bow\r\nor arblast, to halloo to a hunting-horn, or to spur the horse after\r\ngame. But now, at hunting and hawking, and each idle sport of wood and\r\nriver, who so prompt as the Templars in all these fond vanities? They\r\nare forbidden to read, save what their Superior permitted, or listen to\r\nwhat is read, save such holy things as may be recited aloud during the\r\nhours of refaction; but lo! their ears are at the command of idle\r\nminstrels, and their eyes study empty romaunts. They were commanded to\r\nextirpate magic and heresy. Lo! they are charged with studying the\r\naccursed cabalistical secrets of the Jews, and the magic of the Paynim\r\nSaracens. Simpleness of diet was prescribed to them, roots, pottage,\r\ngruels, eating flesh but thrice a-week, because the accustomed feeding\r\non flesh is a dishonourable corruption of the body; and behold, their\r\ntables groan under delicate fare! Their drink was to be water, and now,\r\nto drink like a Templar, is the boast of each jolly boon companion!\r\nThis very garden, filled as it is with curious herbs and trees sent\r\nfrom the Eastern climes, better becomes the harem of an unbelieving\r\nEmir, than the plot which Christian Monks should devote to raise their\r\nhomely pot-herbs.\xe2\x80\x94And O, Conrade! well it were that the relaxation of\r\ndiscipline stopped even here!\xe2\x80\x94Well thou knowest that we were forbidden\r\nto receive those devout women, who at the beginning were associated as\r\nsisters of our Order, because, saith the forty-sixth chapter, the\r\nAncient Enemy hath, by female society, withdrawn many from the right\r\npath to paradise. Nay, in the last capital, being, as it were, the\r\ncope-stone which our blessed founder placed on the pure and undefiled\r\ndoctrine which he had enjoined, we are prohibited from offering, even\r\nto our sisters and our mothers, the kiss of affection\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98ut omnium\r\nmulierum fugiantur oscula\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x94I shame to speak\xe2\x80\x94I shame to think\xe2\x80\x94of the\r\ncorruptions which have rushed in upon us even like a flood. The souls\r\nof our pure founders, the spirits of Hugh de Payen and Godfrey de Saint\r\nOmer, and of the blessed Seven who first joined in dedicating their\r\nlives to the service of the Temple, are disturbed even in the enjoyment\r\nof paradise itself. I have seen them, Conrade, in the visions of the\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94their sainted eyes shed tears for the sins and follies of their\r\nbrethren, and for the foul and shameful luxury in which they wallow.\r\nBeaumanoir, they say, thou slumberest\xe2\x80\x94awake! There is a stain in the\r\nfabric of the Temple, deep and foul as that left by the streaks of\r\nleprosy on the walls of the infected houses of old. 50\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe soldiers of the Cross, who should shun the glance of a woman as\r\nthe eye of a basilisk, live in open sin, not with the females of their\r\nown race only, but with the daughters of the accursed heathen, and more\r\naccursed Jew. Beaumanoir, thou sleepest; up, and avenge our cause!\xe2\x80\x94Slay\r\nthe sinners, male and female!\xe2\x80\x94Take to thee the brand of Phineas!\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nvision fled, Conrade, but as I awaked I could still hear the clank of\r\ntheir mail, and see the waving of their white mantles.\xe2\x80\x94And I will do\r\naccording to their word, I WILL purify the fabric of the Temple! and\r\nthe unclean stones in which the plague is, I will remove and cast out\r\nof the building.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet bethink thee, reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mont-Fitchet, \xe2\x80\x9cthe stain hath\r\nbecome engrained by time and consuetude; let thy reformation be\r\ncautious, as it is just and wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mont-Fitchet,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the stern old man\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit must be sharp and\r\nsudden\xe2\x80\x94the Order is on the crisis of its fate. The sobriety,\r\nself-devotion, and piety of our predecessors, made us powerful\r\nfriends\xe2\x80\x94our presumption, our wealth, our luxury, have raised up against\r\nus mighty enemies.\xe2\x80\x94We must cast away these riches, which are a\r\ntemptation to princes\xe2\x80\x94we must lay down that presumption, which is an\r\noffence to them\xe2\x80\x94we must reform that license of manners, which is a\r\nscandal to the whole Christian world! Or\xe2\x80\x94mark my words\xe2\x80\x94the Order of the\r\nTemple will be utterly demolished\xe2\x80\x94and the Place thereof shall no more\r\nbe known among the nations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow may God avert such a calamity!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, with solemnity, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must deserve his\r\naid. I tell thee, Conrade, that neither the powers in Heaven, nor the\r\npowers on earth, will longer endure the wickedness of this\r\ngeneration\xe2\x80\x94My intelligence is sure\xe2\x80\x94the ground on which our fabric is\r\nreared is already undermined, and each addition we make to the\r\nstructure of our greatness will only sink it the sooner in the abyss.\r\nWe must retrace our steps, and show ourselves the faithful Champions of\r\nthe Cross, sacrificing to our calling, not alone our blood and our\r\nlives\xe2\x80\x94not alone our lusts and our vices\xe2\x80\x94but our ease, our comforts, and\r\nour natural affections, and act as men convinced that many a pleasure\r\nwhich may be lawful to others, is forbidden to the vowed soldier of the\r\nTemple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment a squire, clothed in a threadbare vestment, (for the\r\naspirants after this holy Order wore during their noviciate the\r\ncast-off garments of the knights,) entered the garden, and, bowing\r\nprofoundly before the Grand Master, stood silent, awaiting his\r\npermission ere he presumed to tell his errand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not more seemly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cto see this Damian,\r\nclothed in the garments of Christian humility, thus appear with\r\nreverend silence before his Superior, than but two days since, when the\r\nfond fool was decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pert and as\r\nproud as any popinjay?\xe2\x80\x94Speak, Damian, we permit thee\xe2\x80\x94What is thine\r\nerrand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nSquire, \xe2\x80\x9cwho prays to speak with brother Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou wert right to give me knowledge of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin our presence a Preceptor is but as a common compeer of our Order,\r\nwho may not walk according to his own will, but to that of his\r\nMaster\xe2\x80\x94even according to the text, \xe2\x80\x98In the hearing of the ear he hath\r\nobeyed me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94It imports us especially to know of this Bois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReport speaks him brave and valiant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Conrade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd truly is he so spoken of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cin our valour\r\nonly we are not degenerated from our predecessors, the heroes of the\r\nCross. But brother Brian came into our Order a moody and disappointed\r\nman, stirred, I doubt me, to take our vows and to renounce the world,\r\nnot in sincerity of soul, but as one whom some touch of light\r\ndiscontent had driven into penitence. Since then, he hath become an\r\nactive and earnest agitator, a murmurer, and a machinator, and a leader\r\namongst those who impugn our authority; not considering that the rule\r\nis given to the Master even by the symbol of the staff and the rod\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nstaff to support the infirmities of the weak\xe2\x80\x94the rod to correct the\r\nfaults of delinquents.\xe2\x80\x94Damian,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9clead the Jew to our\r\npresence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe squire departed with a profound reverence, and in a few minutes\r\nreturned, marshalling in Isaac of York. No naked slave, ushered into\r\nthe presence of some mighty prince, could approach his judgment-seat\r\nwith more profound reverence and terror than that with which the Jew\r\ndrew near to the presence of the Grand Master. When he had approached\r\nwithin the distance of three yards, Beaumanoir made a sign with his\r\nstaff that he should come no farther. The Jew kneeled down on the earth\r\nwhich he kissed in token of reverence; then rising, stood before the\r\nTemplars, his hands folded on his bosom, his head bowed on his breast,\r\nin all the submission of Oriental slavery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamian,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cretire, and have a guard ready to\r\nawait our sudden call; and suffer no one to enter the garden until we\r\nshall leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The squire bowed and retreated.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJew,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\nhaughty old man, \xe2\x80\x9cmark me. It suits not our condition to hold with thee\r\nlong communication, nor do we waste words or time upon any one.\r\nWherefore be brief in thy answers to what questions I shall ask thee,\r\nand let thy words be of truth; for if thy tongue doubles with me, I\r\nwill have it torn from thy misbelieving jaws.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew was about to reply, but the Grand Master went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, unbeliever!\xe2\x80\x94not a word in our presence, save in answer to our\r\nquestions.\xe2\x80\x94What is thy business with our brother Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. To tell his tale might be\r\ninterpreted into scandalizing the Order; yet, unless he told it, what\r\nhope could he have of achieving his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s deliverance? Beaumanoir\r\nsaw his mortal apprehension, and condescended to give him some\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor thy wretched person, Jew, so thou dealest\r\nuprightly in this matter. I demand again to know from thee thy business\r\nwith Brian de Bois-Guilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am bearer of a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered out the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cso please your\r\nreverend valour, to that good knight, from Prior Aymer of the Abbey of\r\nJorvaulx.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid I not these were evil times, Conrade?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Master. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nCistertian Prior sends a letter to a soldier of the Temple, and can\r\nfind no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving Jew.\xe2\x80\x94Give me the\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jew, with trembling hands, undid the folds of his Armenian cap, in\r\nwhich he had deposited the Prior\xe2\x80\x99s tablets for the greater security,\r\nand was about to approach, with hand extended and body crouched, to\r\nplace it within the reach of his grim interrogator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack, dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cI touch not misbelievers, save\r\nwith the sword.\xe2\x80\x94Conrade, take thou the letter from the Jew, and give it\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeaumanoir, being thus possessed of the tablets, inspected the outside\r\ncarefully, and then proceeded to undo the packthread which secured its\r\nfolds. \xe2\x80\x9cReverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Conrade, interposing, though with much\r\ndeference, \xe2\x80\x9cwilt thou break the seal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will I not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir, with a frown. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not written in\r\nthe forty-second capital, \xe2\x80\x98De Lectione Literarum\xe2\x80\x99 that a Templar shall\r\nnot receive a letter, no not from his father, without communicating the\r\nsame to the Grand Master, and reading it in his presence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then perused the letter in haste, with an expression of surprise and\r\nhorror; read it over again more slowly; then holding it out to Conrade\r\nwith one hand, and slightly striking it with the other, exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHere\r\nis goodly stuff for one Christian man to write to another, and both\r\nmembers, and no inconsiderable members, of religious professions!\r\nWhen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he solemnly, and looking upward, \xe2\x80\x9cwilt thou come with thy\r\nfanners to purge the thrashing-floor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMont-Fitchet took the letter from his Superior, and was about to peruse\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it aloud, Conrade,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand do thou\xe2\x80\x9d (to\r\nIsaac) \xe2\x80\x9cattend to the purport of it, for we will question thee\r\nconcerning it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConrade read the letter, which was in these words: \xe2\x80\x9cAymer, by divine\r\ngrace, Prior of the Cistertian house of Saint Mary\xe2\x80\x99s of Jorvaulx, to\r\nSir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, a Knight of the holy Order of the Temple,\r\nwisheth health, with the bounties of King Bacchus and of my Lady Venus.\r\nTouching our present condition, dear Brother, we are a captive in the\r\nhands of certain lawless and godless men, who have not feared to detain\r\nour person, and put us to ransom; whereby we have also learned of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune, and that thou hast escaped with that fair\r\nJewish sorceress, whose black eyes have bewitched thee. We are heartily\r\nrejoiced of thy safety; nevertheless, we pray thee to be on thy guard\r\nin the matter of this second Witch of Endor; for we are privately\r\nassured that your Great Master, who careth not a bean for cherry cheeks\r\nand black eyes, comes from Normandy to diminish your mirth, and amend\r\nyour misdoings. Wherefore we pray you heartily to beware, and to be\r\nfound watching, even as the Holy Text hath it, \xe2\x80\x98Invenientur\r\nvigilantes\xe2\x80\x99. And the wealthy Jew her father, Isaac of York, having\r\nprayed of me letters in his behalf, I gave him these, earnestly\r\nadvising, and in a sort entreating, that you do hold the damsel to\r\nransom, seeing he will pay you from his bags as much as may find fifty\r\ndamsels upon safer terms, whereof I trust to have my part when we make\r\nmerry together, as true brothers, not forgetting the wine-cup. For what\r\nsaith the text, \xe2\x80\x98Vinum laetificat cor hominis\xe2\x80\x99; and again, \xe2\x80\x98Rex\r\ndelectabitur pulchritudine tua\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill which merry meeting, we wish you farewell. Given from this den of\r\nthieves, about the hour of matins,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAymer Pr. S. M. Jorvolciencis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Postscriptum.\xe2\x80\x99 Truly your golden chain hath not long abidden with me,\r\nand will now sustain, around the neck of an outlaw deer-stealer, the\r\nwhistle wherewith he calleth on his hounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sayest thou to this, Conrade?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDen of\r\nthieves! and a fit residence is a den of thieves for such a Prior. No\r\nwonder that the hand of God is upon us, and that in the Holy Land we\r\nlose place by place, foot by foot, before the infidels, when we have\r\nsuch churchmen as this Aymer.\xe2\x80\x94And what meaneth he, I trow, by this\r\nsecond Witch of Endor?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his confident, something apart.\r\nConrade was better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of\r\ngallantry, than was his Superior; and he expounded the passage which\r\nembarrassed the Grand Master, to be a sort of language used by worldly\r\nmen towards those whom they loved \xe2\x80\x98par amours\xe2\x80\x99; but the explanation did\r\nnot satisfy the bigoted Beaumanoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is more in it than thou dost guess, Conrade; thy simplicity is\r\nno match for this deep abyss of wickedness. This Rebecca of York was a\r\npupil of that Miriam of whom thou hast heard. Thou shalt hear the Jew\r\nown it even now.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to Isaac, he said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cThy daughter,\r\nthen, is prisoner with Brian de Bois-Guilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, reverend valorous sir,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered poor Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cand whatsoever\r\nransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master. \xe2\x80\x9cThis thy daughter hath practised the\r\nart of healing, hath she not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, gracious sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jew, with more confidence; \xe2\x80\x9cand knight\r\nand yeoman, squire and vassal, may bless the goodly gift which Heaven\r\nhath assigned to her. Many a one can testify that she hath recovered\r\nthem by her art, when every other human aid hath proved vain; but the\r\nblessing of the God of Jacob was upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBeaumanoir turned to Mont-Fitchet with a grim smile. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cthe deceptions of the devouring Enemy! Behold the baits with\r\nwhich he fishes for souls, giving a poor space of earthly life in\r\nexchange for eternal happiness hereafter. Well said our blessed rule,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Semper percutiatur leo vorans\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x94Up on the lion! Down with the\r\ndestroyer!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, shaking aloft his mystic abacus, as if in defiance\r\nof the powers of darkness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThy daughter worketh the cures, I doubt\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d thus he went on to address the Jew, \xe2\x80\x9cby words and sighs, and\r\nperiapts, and other cabalistical mysteries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, reverend and brave Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in chief measure\r\nby a balsam of marvellous virtue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere had she that secret?\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was delivered to her,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac, reluctantly, \xe2\x80\x9cby Miriam, a\r\nsage matron of our tribe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, false Jew!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cwas it not from that same\r\nwitch Miriam, the abomination of whose enchantments have been heard of\r\nthroughout every Christian land?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Grand Master, crossing\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cHer body was burnt at a stake, and her ashes were scattered\r\nto the four winds; and so be it with me and mine Order, if I do not as\r\nmuch to her pupil, and more also! I will teach her to throw spell and\r\nincantation over the soldiers of the blessed Temple.\xe2\x80\x94There, Damian,\r\nspurn this Jew from the gate\xe2\x80\x94shoot him dead if he oppose or turn again.\r\nWith his daughter we will deal as the Christian law and our own high\r\noffice warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Isaac was hurried off accordingly, and expelled from the\r\npreceptory; all his entreaties, and even his offers, unheard and\r\ndisregarded. He could do not better than return to the house of the\r\nRabbi, and endeavour, through his means, to learn how his daughter was\r\nto be disposed of. He had hitherto feared for her honour, he was now to\r\ntremble for her life. Meanwhile, the Grand Master ordered to his\r\npresence the Preceptor of Templestowe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nSay not my art is fraud\xe2\x80\x94all live by seeming.\r\nThe beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier\r\nGains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;\r\nThe clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldier\r\nWill eke with it his service.\xe2\x80\x94All admit it,\r\nAll practise it; and he who is content\r\nWith showing what he is, shall have small credit\r\nIn church, or camp, or state\xe2\x80\x94So wags the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert Malvoisin, President, or, in the language of the Order,\r\nPreceptor of the establishment of Templestowe, was brother to that\r\nPhilip Malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this\r\nhistory, and was, like that baron, in close league with Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert.\r\n\r\nAmongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the Temple Order\r\nincluded but too many, Albert of Templestowe might be distinguished;\r\nbut with this difference from the audacious Bois-Guilbert, that he knew\r\nhow to throw over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and\r\nto assume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised.\r\nHad not the arrival of the Grand Master been so unexpectedly sudden, he\r\nwould have seen nothing at Templestowe which might have appeared to\r\nargue any relaxation of discipline. And, even although surprised, and,\r\nto a certain extent, detected, Albert Malvoisin listened with such\r\nrespect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his Superior, and made\r\nsuch haste to reform the particulars he censured,\xe2\x80\x94succeeded, in fine,\r\nso well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been\r\nlately devoted to license and pleasure, that Lucas Beaumanoir began to\r\nentertain a higher opinion of the Preceptor\xe2\x80\x99s morals, than the first\r\nappearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.\r\n\r\nBut these favourable sentiments on the part of the Grand Master were\r\ngreatly shaken by the intelligence that Albert had received within a\r\nhouse of religion the Jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the\r\nparamour of a brother of the Order; and when Albert appeared before\r\nhim, he was regarded with unwonted sternness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy Order\r\nof the Temple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, in a severe tone, \xe2\x80\x9ca Jewish\r\nwoman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, Sir\r\nPreceptor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlbert Malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate\r\nRebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building,\r\nand every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being\r\nknown. He read in the looks of Beaumanoir ruin to Bois-Guilbert and to\r\nhimself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you mute?\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Grand Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it permitted to me to reply?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Preceptor, in a tone of\r\nthe deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an\r\ninstant\xe2\x80\x99s space for arranging his ideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, you are permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cspeak, and say,\r\nknowest thou the capital of our holy rule,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98De commilitonibus Templi in\r\nsancta civitate, qui cum miserrimis mulieribus versantur, propter\r\noblectationem carnis?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d 51\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, most reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Preceptor, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\r\nrisen to this office in the Order, being ignorant of one of its most\r\nimportant prohibitions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it, then, I demand of thee once more, that thou hast\r\nsuffered a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a Jewish\r\nsorceress, into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Jewish sorceress!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Albert Malvoisin; \xe2\x80\x9cgood angels guard us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, brother, a Jewish sorceress!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave said it. Darest thou deny that this Rebecca, the daughter of that\r\nwretched usurer Isaac of York, and the pupil of the foul witch Miriam,\r\nis now\xe2\x80\x94shame to be thought or spoken!\xe2\x80\x94lodged within this thy\r\nPreceptory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wisdom, reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Preceptor, \xe2\x80\x9chath rolled\r\naway the darkness from my understanding. Much did I wonder that so good\r\na knight as Brian de Bois-Guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the\r\ncharms of this female, whom I received into this house merely to place\r\na bar betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been\r\ncemented at the expense of the fall of our valiant and religious\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndemanded the Grand Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! under this roof?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor, crossing himself; \xe2\x80\x9cSaint\r\nMagdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!\xe2\x80\x94No! if I have sinned in\r\nreceiving her here, it was in the erring thought that I might thus\r\nbreak off our brother\xe2\x80\x99s besotted devotion to this Jewess, which seemed\r\nto me so wild and unnatural, that I could not but ascribe it to some\r\ntouch of insanity, more to be cured by pity than reproof. But since\r\nyour reverend wisdom hath discovered this Jewish queen to be a\r\nsorceress, perchance it may account fully for his enamoured folly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doth!\xe2\x80\x94it doth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, brother Conrade, the peril\r\nof yielding to the first devices and blandishments of Satan! We look\r\nupon woman only to gratify the lust of the eye, and to take pleasure in\r\nwhat men call her beauty; and the Ancient Enemy, the devouring Lion,\r\nobtains power over us, to complete, by talisman and spell, a work which\r\nwas begun by idleness and folly. It may be that our brother\r\nBois-Guilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe\r\nchastisement; rather the support of the staff, than the strokes of the\r\nrod; and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly,\r\nand restore him to his brethren.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were deep pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Conrade Mont-Fitchet, \xe2\x80\x9cto lose to the Order\r\none of its best lances, when the Holy Community most requires the aid\r\nof its sons. Three hundred Saracens hath this Brian de Bois-Guilbert\r\nslain with his own hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blood of these accursed dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be a\r\nsweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they\r\ndespise and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells\r\nand charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net. He shall\r\nburst the bands of this Delilah, as Sampson burst the two new cords\r\nwith which the Philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the\r\ninfidels, even heaps upon heaps. But concerning this foul witch, who\r\nhath flung her enchantments over a brother of the Holy Temple,\r\nassuredly she shall die the death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the laws of England,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said the Preceptor, who, though delighted\r\nthat the Grand Master\xe2\x80\x99s resentment, thus fortunately averted from\r\nhimself and Bois-Guilbert, had taken another direction, began now to\r\nfear he was carrying it too far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe laws of England,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Beaumanoir, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit and enjoin each\r\njudge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. The most petty\r\nbaron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain.\r\nAnd shall that power be denied to the Grand Master of the Temple within\r\na preceptory of his Order?\xe2\x80\x94No!\xe2\x80\x94we will judge and condemn. The witch\r\nshall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be\r\nforgiven. Prepare the Castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlbert Malvoisin bowed and retired,\xe2\x80\x94not to give directions for\r\npreparing the hall, but to seek out Brian de Bois-Guilbert, and\r\ncommunicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. It was not\r\nlong ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had\r\nanew sustained from the fair Jewess. \xe2\x80\x9cThe unthinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved\r\nher life at the risk of his own! By Heaven, Malvoisin! I abode until\r\nroof and rafters crackled and crashed around me. I was the butt of a\r\nhundred arrows; they rattled on mine armour like hailstones against a\r\nlatticed casement, and the only use I made of my shield was for her\r\nprotection. This did I endure for her; and now the self-willed girl\r\nupbraids me that I did not leave her to perish, and refuses me not only\r\nthe slightest proof of gratitude, but even the most distant hope that\r\never she will be brought to grant any. The devil, that possessed her\r\nrace with obstinacy, has concentrated its full force in her single\r\nperson!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor, \xe2\x80\x9cI think, possessed you both. How oft\r\nhave I preached to you caution, if not continence? Did I not tell you\r\nthat there were enough willing Christian damsels to be met with, who\r\nwould think it sin to refuse so brave a knight \xe2\x80\x98le don d\xe2\x80\x99amoureux\r\nmerci\xe2\x80\x99, and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate\r\nJewess! By the mass, I think old Lucas Beaumanoir guesses right, when\r\nhe maintains she hath cast a spell over you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucas Beaumanoir!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Bois-Guilbert reproachfully\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAre these your\r\nprecautions, Malvoisin? Hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that\r\nRebecca is in the Preceptory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I help it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor. \xe2\x80\x9cI neglected nothing that\r\ncould keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the\r\ndevil or no, the devil only can tell. But I have turned the matter as I\r\ncould; you are safe if you renounce Rebecca. You are pitied\xe2\x80\x94the victim\r\nof magical delusion. She is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shall not, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Heaven, she must and will!\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither you nor any\r\none else can save her. Lucas Beaumanoir hath settled that the death of\r\na Jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous\r\nindulgences of the Knights Templars; and thou knowest he hath both the\r\npower and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBois-Guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they may believe, I know not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin, calmly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nknow well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ninety-nine to\r\nthe hundred, will cry \xe2\x80\x98amen\xe2\x80\x99 to the Grand Master\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert. \xe2\x80\x9cAlbert, thou art my friend. Thou must\r\nconnive at her escape, Malvoisin, and I will transport her to some\r\nplace of greater security and secrecy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot, if I would,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Preceptor; \xe2\x80\x9cthe mansion is filled\r\nwith the attendants of the Grand Master, and others who are devoted to\r\nhim. And, to be frank with you, brother, I would not embark with you in\r\nthis matter, even if I could hope to bring my bark to haven. I have\r\nrisked enough already for your sake. I have no mind to encounter a\r\nsentence of degradation, or even to lose my Preceptory, for the sake of\r\na painted piece of Jewish flesh and blood. And you, if you will be\r\nguided by my counsel, will give up this wild-goose chase, and fly your\r\nhawk at some other game. Think, Bois-Guilbert,\xe2\x80\x94thy present rank, thy\r\nfuture honours, all depend on thy place in the Order. Shouldst thou\r\nadhere perversely to thy passion for this Rebecca, thou wilt give\r\nBeaumanoir the power of expelling thee, and he will not neglect it. He\r\nis jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and\r\nhe knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it. Doubt not he will\r\nruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of\r\na Jewish sorceress. Give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst\r\nnot control him. When the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest\r\ncaress the daughters of Judah, or burn them, as may best suit thine own\r\nhumour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalvoisin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art a cold-blooded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in which\r\nBois-Guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca cold-blooded\r\nfriend I am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. I tell thee\r\nonce more, that thou canst not save Rebecca. I tell thee once more,\r\nthou canst but perish with her. Go hie thee to the Grand Master\xe2\x80\x94throw\r\nthyself at his feet and tell him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at his feet, by Heaven! but to the dotard\xe2\x80\x99s very beard will I\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay to him, then, to his beard,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Malvoisin, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nyou love this captive Jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost\r\nenlarge on thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the\r\ndeath of the fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by\r\nthe avowal of a crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy\r\nbrethren, and must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and\r\npower, to lift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels\r\nbetween Flanders and Burgundy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou speakest the truth, Malvoisin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian de Bois-Guilbert,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cI will give the hoary bigot no advantage\r\nover me; and for Rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that I should\r\nexpose rank and honour for her sake. I will cast her off\xe2\x80\x94yes, I will\r\nleave her to her fate, unless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin; \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\r\nare but the toys which amuse our lighter hours\xe2\x80\x94ambition is the serious\r\nbusiness of life. Perish a thousand such frail baubles as this Jewess,\r\nbefore thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched\r\nbefore thee! For the present we part, nor must we be seen to hold close\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94I must order the hall for his judgment-seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cso soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Preceptor, \xe2\x80\x9ctrial moves rapidly on when the judge has\r\ndetermined the sentence beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, when he was left alone, \xe2\x80\x9cthou art like\r\nto cost me dear\xe2\x80\x94Why cannot I abandon thee to thy fate, as this calm\r\nhypocrite recommends?\xe2\x80\x94One effort will I make to save thee\xe2\x80\x94but beware of\r\ningratitude! for if I am again repulsed, my vengeance shall equal my\r\nlove. The life and honour of Bois-Guilbert must not be hazarded, where\r\ncontempt and reproaches are his only reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined\r\nby Conrade Mont-Fitchet, who acquainted him with the Grand Master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution to bring the Jewess to instant trial for sorcery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is surely a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have many Jewish\r\nphysicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful\r\ncures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Master thinks otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mont-Fitchet; \xe2\x80\x9cand, Albert, I\r\nwill be upright with thee\xe2\x80\x94wizard or not, it were better that this\r\nmiserable damsel die, than that Brian de Bois-Guilbert should be lost\r\nto the Order, or the Order divided by internal dissension. Thou knowest\r\nhis high rank, his fame in arms\xe2\x80\x94thou knowest the zeal with which many\r\nof our brethren regard him\xe2\x80\x94but all this will not avail him with our\r\nGrand Master, should he consider Brian as the accomplice, not the\r\nvictim, of this Jewess. Were the souls of the twelve tribes in her\r\nsingle body, it were better she suffered alone, than that Bois-Guilbert\r\nwere partner in her destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been working him even now to abandon her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nstill, are there grounds enough to condemn this Rebecca for\r\nsorcery?\xe2\x80\x94Will not the Grand Master change his mind when he sees that\r\nthe proofs are so weak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be strengthened, Albert,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mont-Fitchet, \xe2\x80\x9cthey must\r\nbe strengthened. Dost thou understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor, \xe2\x80\x9cnor do I scruple to do aught for\r\nadvancement of the Order\xe2\x80\x94but there is little time to find engines\r\nfitting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalvoisin, they MUST be found,\xe2\x80\x9d said Conrade; \xe2\x80\x9cwell will it advantage\r\nboth the Order and thee. This Templestowe is a poor Preceptory\xe2\x80\x94that of\r\nMaison-Dieu is worth double its value\xe2\x80\x94thou knowest my interest with our\r\nold Chief\xe2\x80\x94find those who can carry this matter through, and thou art\r\nPreceptor of Maison-Dieu in the fertile Kent\xe2\x80\x94How sayst thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Malvoisin, \xe2\x80\x9camong those who came hither with\r\nBois-Guilbert, two fellows whom I well know; servants they were to my\r\nbrother Philip de Malvoisin, and passed from his service to that of\r\nFront-de-B\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x94It may be they know something of the witcheries of this\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway, seek them out instantly\xe2\x80\x94and hark thee, if a byzant or two will\r\nsharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Preceptor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAway, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mont-Fitchet; \xe2\x80\x9cat noon the affair will proceed. I\r\nhave not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned\r\nto the stake Hamet Alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the Moslem faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when Rebecca\r\nheard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place\r\nof confinement. The noise announced the arrival of several persons, and\r\nthe circumstance rather gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the\r\nsolitary visits of the fierce and passionate Bois-Guilbert than of any\r\nevil that could befall her besides. The door of the chamber was\r\nunlocked, and Conrade and the Preceptor Malvoisin entered, attended by\r\nfour warders clothed in black, and bearing halberds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaughter of an accursed race!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor, \xe2\x80\x9carise and follow\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand for what purpose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamsel,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Conrade, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for thee to question, but to\r\nobey. Nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought\r\nbefore the tribunal of the Grand Master of our holy Order, there to\r\nanswer for thine offences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the God of Abraham be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, folding her hands\r\ndevoutly; \xe2\x80\x9cthe name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to me\r\nas the name of a protector. Most willingly do I follow thee\xe2\x80\x94permit me\r\nonly to wrap my veil around my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long\r\ngallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the\r\ngreat hall in which the Grand Master had for the time established his\r\ncourt of justice.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of this ample apartment was filled with squires and\r\nyeomen, who made way not without some difficulty for Rebecca, attended\r\nby the Preceptor and Mont-Fitchet, and followed by the guard of\r\nhalberdiers, to move forward to the seat appointed for her. As she\r\npassed through the crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a\r\nscrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which she received almost\r\nunconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its contents.\r\nThe assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly\r\ngave her courage to look around, and to mark into whose presence she\r\nhad been conducted. She gazed, accordingly, upon the scene, which we\r\nshall endeavour to describe in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nStern was the law which bade its vot\xe2\x80\x99ries leave\r\nAt human woes with human hearts to grieve;\r\nStern was the law, which at the winning wile\r\nOf frank and harmless mirth forbade to smile;\r\nBut sterner still, when high the iron-rod\r\nOf tyrant power she shook, and call\xe2\x80\x99d that power of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy\r\nRebecca, occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the\r\ngreat hall\xe2\x80\x94a platform, which we have already described as the place of\r\nhonour, destined to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants\r\nor guests of an ancient mansion.\r\n\r\nOn an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the Grand Master\r\nof the Temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his\r\nhand the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the Order. At his feet\r\nwas placed a table, occupied by two scribes, chaplains of the Order,\r\nwhose duty it was to reduce to formal record the proceedings of the\r\nday. The black dresses, bare scalps, and demure looks of these\r\nchurch-men, formed a strong contrast to the warlike appearance of the\r\nknights who attended, either as residing in the Preceptory, or as come\r\nthither to attend upon their Grand Master. The Preceptors, of whom\r\nthere were four present, occupied seats lower in height, and somewhat\r\ndrawn back behind that of their superior; and the knights, who enjoyed\r\nno such rank in the Order, were placed on benches still lower, and\r\npreserving the same distance from the Preceptors as these from the\r\nGrand Master. Behind them, but still upon the dais or elevated portion\r\nof the hall, stood the esquires of the Order, in white dresses of an\r\ninferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly wore an aspect of the most profound gravity; and in\r\nthe faces of the knights might be perceived traces of military daring,\r\nunited with the solemn carriage becoming men of a religious profession,\r\nand which, in the presence of their Grand Master, failed not to sit\r\nupon every brow.\r\n\r\nThe remaining and lower part of the hall was filled with guards,\r\nholding partisans, and with other attendants whom curiosity had drawn\r\nthither, to see at once a Grand Master and a Jewish sorceress. By far\r\nthe greater part of those inferior persons were, in one rank or other,\r\nconnected with the Order, and were accordingly distinguished by their\r\nblack dresses. But peasants from the neighbouring country were not\r\nrefused admittance; for it was the pride of Beaumanoir to render the\r\nedifying spectacle of the justice which he administered as public as\r\npossible. His large blue eyes seemed to expand as he gazed around the\r\nassembly, and his countenance appeared elated by the conscious dignity,\r\nand imaginary merit, of the part which he was about to perform. A\r\npsalm, which he himself accompanied with a deep mellow voice, which age\r\nhad not deprived of its powers, commenced the proceedings of the day;\r\nand the solemn sounds, \xe2\x80\x9cVenite exultemus Domino\xe2\x80\x9d, so often sung by the\r\nTemplars before engaging with earthly adversaries, was judged by Lucas\r\nmost appropriate to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he\r\ndeemed it, over the powers of darkness. The deep prolonged notes,\r\nraised by a hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the\r\nchoral chant, arose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and rolled on\r\namongst its arches with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of\r\nmighty waters.\r\n\r\nWhen the sounds ceased, the Grand Master glanced his eye slowly around\r\nthe circle, and observed that the seat of one of the Preceptors was\r\nvacant. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left\r\nhis place, and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the\r\nbenches occupied by the Knights Companions of the Temple, one hand\r\nextending his long mantle, so as in some degree to hide his face; while\r\nthe other held his cross-handled sword, with the point of which,\r\nsheathed as it was, he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, after favouring him with a glance\r\nof compassion. \xe2\x80\x9cThou seest, Conrade, how this holy work distresses him.\r\nTo this can the light look of woman, aided by the Prince of the Powers\r\nof this world, bring a valiant and worthy knight!\xe2\x80\x94Seest thou he cannot\r\nlook upon us; he cannot look upon her; and who knows by what impulse\r\nfrom his tormentor his hand forms these cabalistic lines upon the\r\nfloor?\xe2\x80\x94It may be our life and safety are thus aimed at; but we spit at\r\nand defy the foul enemy. \xe2\x80\x98Semper Leo percutiatur!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was communicated apart to his confidential follower, Conrade\r\nMont-Fitchet. The Grand Master then raised his voice, and addressed the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend and valiant men, Knights, Preceptors, and Companions of this\r\nHoly Order, my brethren and my children!\xe2\x80\x94you also, well-born and pious\r\nEsquires, who aspire to wear this holy Cross!\xe2\x80\x94and you also, Christian\r\nbrethren, of every degree!\xe2\x80\x94Be it known to you, that it is not defect of\r\npower in us which hath occasioned the assembling of this congregation;\r\nfor, however unworthy in our person, yet to us is committed, with this\r\nbatoon, full power to judge and to try all that regards the weal of\r\nthis our Holy Order. Holy Saint Bernard, in the rule of our knightly\r\nand religious profession, hath said, in the fifty-ninth capital, 53\r\nthat he would not that brethren be called together in council, save at\r\nthe will and command of the Master; leaving it free to us, as to those\r\nmore worthy fathers who have preceded us in this our office, to judge,\r\nas well of the occasion as of the time and place in which a chapter of\r\nthe whole Order, or of any part thereof, may be convoked. Also, in all\r\nsuch chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and\r\nto proceed according to our own pleasure. But when the raging wolf hath\r\nmade an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it\r\nis the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that\r\nwith bows and slings they may quell the invader, according to our\r\nwell-known rule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. We have\r\ntherefore summoned to our presence a Jewish woman, by name Rebecca,\r\ndaughter of Isaac of York\xe2\x80\x94a woman infamous for sortileges and for\r\nwitcheries; whereby she hath maddened the blood, and besotted the\r\nbrain, not of a churl, but of a Knight\xe2\x80\x94not of a secular Knight, but of\r\none devoted to the service of the Holy Temple\xe2\x80\x94not of a Knight\r\nCompanion, but of a Preceptor of our Order, first in honour as in\r\nplace. Our brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, is well known to ourselves,\r\nand to all degrees who now hear me, as a true and zealous champion of\r\nthe Cross, by whose arm many deeds of valour have been wrought in the\r\nHoly Land, and the holy places purified from pollution by the blood of\r\nthose infidels who defiled them. Neither have our brother\xe2\x80\x99s sagacity\r\nand prudence been less in repute among his brethren than his valour and\r\ndiscipline; in so much, that knights, both in eastern and western\r\nlands, have named De Bois-Guilbert as one who may well be put in\r\nnomination as successor to this batoon, when it shall please Heaven to\r\nrelease us from the toil of bearing it. If we were told that such a\r\nman, so honoured, and so honourable, suddenly casting away regard for\r\nhis character, his vows, his brethren, and his prospects, had\r\nassociated to himself a Jewish damsel, wandered in this lewd company,\r\nthrough solitary places, defended her person in preference to his own,\r\nand, finally, was so utterly blinded and besotted by his folly, as to\r\nbring her even to one of our own Preceptories, what should we say but\r\nthat the noble knight was possessed by some evil demon, or influenced\r\nby some wicked spell?\xe2\x80\x94If we could suppose it otherwise, think not rank,\r\nvalour, high repute, or any earthly consideration, should prevent us\r\nfrom visiting him with punishment, that the evil thing might be\r\nremoved, even according to the text, \xe2\x80\x98Auferte malum ex vobis\xe2\x80\x99. For\r\nvarious and heinous are the acts of transgression against the rule of\r\nour blessed Order in this lamentable history.\xe2\x80\x941st, He hath walked\r\naccording to his proper will, contrary to capital 33, \xe2\x80\x98Quod nullus\r\njuxta propriam voluntatem incedat\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x942d, He hath held communication with\r\nan excommunicated person, capital 57, \xe2\x80\x98Ut fratres non participent cum\r\nexcommunicatis\xe2\x80\x99, and therefore hath a portion in \xe2\x80\x98Anathema\r\nMaranatha\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x943d, He hath conversed with strange women, contrary to the\r\ncapital, \xe2\x80\x98Ut fratres non conversantur cum extraneis mulieribus\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x944th,\r\nHe hath not avoided, nay, he hath, it is to be feared, solicited the\r\nkiss of woman; by which, saith the last rule of our renowned Order, \xe2\x80\x98Ut\r\nfugiantur oscula\xe2\x80\x99, the soldiers of the Cross are brought into a snare.\r\nFor which heinous and multiplied guilt, Brian de Bois-Guilbert should\r\nbe cut off and cast out from our congregation, were he the right hand\r\nand right eye thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused. A low murmur went through the assembly. Some of the younger\r\npart, who had been inclined to smile at the statute \xe2\x80\x98De osculis\r\nfugiendis\xe2\x80\x99, became now grave enough, and anxiously waited what the\r\nGrand Master was next to propose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand so great should indeed be the punishment of a\r\nKnight Templar, who wilfully offended against the rules of his Order in\r\nsuch weighty points. But if, by means of charms and of spells, Satan\r\nhad obtained dominion over the Knight, perchance because he cast his\r\neyes too lightly upon a damsel\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, we are then rather to lament\r\nthan chastise his backsliding; and, imposing on him only such penance\r\nas may purify him from his iniquity, we are to turn the full edge of\r\nour indignation upon the accursed instrument, which had so well-nigh\r\noccasioned his utter falling away.\xe2\x80\x94Stand forth, therefore, and bear\r\nwitness, ye who have witnessed these unhappy doings, that we may judge\r\nof the sum and bearing thereof; and judge whether our justice may be\r\nsatisfied with the punishment of this infidel woman, or if we must go\r\non, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding against our\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which\r\nBois-Guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save Rebecca from the\r\nblazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to\r\nher safety. The men gave these details with the exaggerations common to\r\nvulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event,\r\nand their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased\r\nby the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the\r\neminent person for whose information it had been delivered. Thus the\r\ndangers which Bois-Guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufficiently\r\ngreat, became portentous in their narrative. The devotion of the Knight\r\nto Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only of\r\ndiscretion, but even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and\r\nhis deference to what she said, even although her language was often\r\nsevere and upbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a\r\nman of his haughty temper, seemed almost preternatural.\r\n\r\nThe Preceptor of Templestowe was then called on to describe the manner\r\nin which Bois-Guilbert and the Jewess arrived at the Preceptory. The\r\nevidence of Malvoisin was skilfully guarded. But while he apparently\r\nstudied to spare the feelings of Bois-Guilbert, he threw in, from time\r\nto time, such hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some\r\ntemporary alienation of mind, so deeply did he appear to be enamoured\r\nof the damsel whom he brought along with him. With sighs of penitence,\r\nthe Preceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted Rebecca and\r\nher lover within the walls of the Preceptory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut my defence,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9chas been made in my confession to our most reverend father\r\nthe Grand Master; he knows my motives were not evil, though my conduct\r\nmay have been irregular. Joyfully will I submit to any penance he shall\r\nassign me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast spoken well, Brother Albert,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir; \xe2\x80\x9cthy motives\r\nwere good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring\r\nbrother in his career of precipitate folly. But thy conduct was wrong;\r\nas he that would stop a runaway steed, and seizing by the stirrup\r\ninstead of the bridle, receiveth injury himself, instead of\r\naccomplishing his purpose. Thirteen paternosters are assigned by our\r\npious founder for matins, and nine for vespers; be those services\r\ndoubled by thee. Thrice a-week are Templars permitted the use of flesh;\r\nbut do thou keep fast for all the seven days. This do for six weeks to\r\ncome, and thy penance is accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a hypocritical look of the deepest submission, the Preceptor of\r\nTemplestowe bowed to the ground before his Superior, and resumed his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it not well, brethren,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we examine\r\nsomething into the former life and conversation of this woman,\r\nspecially that we may discover whether she be one likely to use magical\r\ncharms and spells, since the truths which we have heard may well\r\nincline us to suppose, that in this unhappy course our erring brother\r\nhas been acted upon by some infernal enticement and delusion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerman of Goodalricke was the Fourth Preceptor present; the other three\r\nwere Conrade, Malvoisin, and Bois-Guilbert himself. Herman was an\r\nancient warrior, whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the\r\nsabre of the Moslemah, and had great rank and consideration among his\r\nbrethren. He arose and bowed to the Grand Master, who instantly granted\r\nhim license of speech. \xe2\x80\x9cI would crave to know, most Reverend Father, of\r\nour valiant brother, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, what he says to these\r\nwondrous accusations, and with what eye he himself now regards his\r\nunhappy intercourse with this Jewish maiden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrian de Bois-Guilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hearest the\r\nquestion which our Brother of Goodalricke desirest thou shouldst\r\nanswer. I command thee to reply to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBois-Guilbert turned his head towards the Grand Master when thus\r\naddressed, and remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is possessed by a dumb devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master. \xe2\x80\x9cAvoid thee,\r\nSathanus!\xe2\x80\x94Speak, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, I conjure thee, by this symbol\r\nof our Holy Order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBois-Guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and\r\nindignation, the expression of which, he was well aware, would have\r\nlittle availed him. \xe2\x80\x9cBrian de Bois-Guilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9creplies\r\nnot, most Reverend Father, to such wild and vague charges. If his\r\nhonour be impeached, he will defend it with his body, and with that\r\nsword which has often fought for Christendom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe forgive thee, Brother Brian,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cthough that\r\nthou hast boasted thy warlike achievements before us, is a glorifying\r\nof thine own deeds, and cometh of the Enemy, who tempteth us to exalt\r\nour own worship. But thou hast our pardon, judging thou speakest less\r\nof thine own suggestion than from the impulse of him whom by Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleave, we will quell and drive forth from our assembly.\xe2\x80\x9d A glance of\r\ndisdain flashed from the dark fierce eyes of Bois-Guilbert, but he made\r\nno reply.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9csince our Brother of\r\nGoodalricke\xe2\x80\x99s question has been thus imperfectly answered, pursue we\r\nour quest, brethren, and with our patron\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, we will search\r\nto the bottom this mystery of iniquity.\xe2\x80\x94Let those who have aught to\r\nwitness of the life and conversation of this Jewish woman, stand forth\r\nbefore us.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a bustle in the lower part of the hall, and when\r\nthe Grand Master enquired the reason, it was replied, there was in the\r\ncrowd a bedridden man, whom the prisoner had restored to the perfect\r\nuse of his limbs, by a miraculous balsam.\r\n\r\nThe poor peasant, a Saxon by birth, was dragged forward to the bar,\r\nterrified at the penal consequences which he might have incurred by the\r\nguilt of having been cured of the palsy by a Jewish damsel. Perfectly\r\ncured he certainly was not, for he supported himself forward on\r\ncrutches to give evidence. Most unwilling was his testimony, and given\r\nwith many tears; but he admitted that two years since, when residing at\r\nYork, he was suddenly afflicted with a sore disease, while labouring\r\nfor Isaac the rich Jew, in his vocation of a joiner; that he had been\r\nunable to stir from his bed until the remedies applied by Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndirections, and especially a warming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in\r\nsome degree restored him to the use of his limbs. Moreover, he said,\r\nshe had given him a pot of that precious ointment, and furnished him\r\nwith a piece of money withal, to return to the house of his father,\r\nnear to Templestowe. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd may it please your gracious Reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe man, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think the damsel meant harm by me, though she hath\r\nthe ill hap to be a Jewess; for even when I used her remedy, I said the\r\nPater and the Creed, and it never operated a whit less kindly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, slave,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cand begone! It well suits\r\nbrutes like thee to be tampering and trinketing with hellish cures, and\r\nto be giving your labour to the sons of mischief. I tell thee, the\r\nfiend can impose diseases for the very purpose of removing them, in\r\norder to bring into credit some diabolical fashion of cure. Hast thou\r\nthat unguent of which thou speakest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant, fumbling in his bosom with a trembling hand, produced a\r\nsmall box, bearing some Hebrew characters on the lid, which was, with\r\nmost of the audience, a sure proof that the devil had stood apothecary.\r\nBeaumanoir, after crossing himself, took the box into his hand, and,\r\nlearned in most of the Eastern tongues, read with ease the motto on the\r\nlid,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange powers of Sathanas.\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich can convert Scripture\r\ninto blasphemy, mingling poison with our necessary food!\xe2\x80\x94Is there no\r\nleech here who can tell us the ingredients of this mystic unguent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo mediciners, as they called themselves, the one a monk, the other a\r\nbarber, appeared, and avouched they knew nothing of the materials,\r\nexcepting that they savoured of myrrh and camphire, which they took to\r\nbe Oriental herbs. But with the true professional hatred to a\r\nsuccessful practitioner of their art, they insinuated that, since the\r\nmedicine was beyond their own knowledge, it must necessarily have been\r\ncompounded from an unlawful and magical pharmacopeia; since they\r\nthemselves, though no conjurors, fully understood every branch of their\r\nart, so far as it might be exercised with the good faith of a\r\nChristian. When this medical research was ended, the Saxon peasant\r\ndesired humbly to have back the medicine which he had found so\r\nsalutary; but the Grand Master frowned severely at the request. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis thy name, fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the cripple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigg, the son of Snell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the peasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Higg, son of Snell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee it is\r\nbetter to be bedridden, than to accept the benefit of unbelievers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmedicine that thou mayest arise and walk; better to despoil infidels of\r\ntheir treasure by the strong hand, than to accept of them benevolent\r\ngifts, or do them service for wages. Go thou, and do as I have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlack,\xe2\x80\x9d said the peasant, \xe2\x80\x9can it shall not displease your Reverence,\r\nthe lesson comes too late for me, for I am but a maimed man; but I will\r\ntell my two brethren, who serve the rich Rabbi Nathan Ben Samuel, that\r\nyour mastership says it is more lawful to rob him than to render him\r\nfaithful service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with the prating villain!\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir, who was not prepared\r\nto refute this practical application of his general maxim.\r\n\r\nHigg, the son of Snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the\r\nfate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even\r\nat the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the\r\nterror of which withered his very heart within him.\r\n\r\nAt this period of the trial, the Grand Master commanded Rebecca to\r\nunveil herself. Opening her lips for the first time, she replied\r\npatiently, but with dignity,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat it was not the wont of the daughters\r\nof her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of\r\nstrangers.\xe2\x80\x9d The sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her\r\nreply, impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy. But\r\nBeaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity\r\nwhich could interfere with his imagined duty, was a virtue of itself,\r\nrepeated his commands that his victim should be unveiled. The guards\r\nwere about to remove her veil accordingly, when she stood up before the\r\nGrand Master and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNay, but for the love of your own\r\ndaughters\xe2\x80\x94Alas,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, recollecting herself, \xe2\x80\x9cye have no\r\ndaughters!\xe2\x80\x94yet for the remembrance of your mothers\xe2\x80\x94for the love of your\r\nsisters, and of female decency, let me not be thus handled in your\r\npresence; it suits not a maiden to be disrobed by such rude grooms. I\r\nwill obey you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with an expression of patient sorrow in her\r\nvoice, which had almost melted the heart of Beaumanoir himself; \xe2\x80\x9cye are\r\nelders among your people, and at your command I will show the features\r\nof an ill-fated maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her veil, and looked on them with a countenance in which\r\nbashfulness contended with dignity. Her exceeding beauty excited a\r\nmurmur of surprise, and the younger knights told each other with their\r\neyes, in silent correspondence, that Brian\xe2\x80\x99s best apology was in the\r\npower of her real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. But\r\nHigg, the son of Snell, felt most deeply the effect produced by the\r\nsight of the countenance of his benefactress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go forth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the warders at the door of the hall,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clet\r\nme go forth!\xe2\x80\x94To look at her again will kill me, for I have had a share\r\nin murdering her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace, poor man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; \xe2\x80\x9cthou\r\nhast done me no harm by speaking the truth\xe2\x80\x94thou canst not aid me by thy\r\ncomplaints or lamentations. Peace, I pray thee\xe2\x80\x94go home and save\r\nthyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHigg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders, who\r\nwere apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them\r\nreprehension, and upon himself punishment. But he promised to be\r\nsilent, and was permitted to remain. The two men-at-arms, with whom\r\nAlbert Malvoisin had not failed to communicate upon the import of their\r\ntestimony, were now called forward. Though both were hardened and\r\ninflexible villains, the sight of the captive maiden, as well as her\r\nexcelling beauty, at first appeared to stagger them; but an expressive\r\nglance from the Preceptor of Templestowe restored them to their dogged\r\ncomposure; and they delivered, with a precision which would have seemed\r\nsuspicious to more impartial judges, circumstances either altogether\r\nfictitious or trivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant\r\nwith suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and\r\nthe sinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts. The\r\ncircumstances of their evidence would have been, in modern days,\r\ndivided into two classes\xe2\x80\x94those which were immaterial, and those which\r\nwere actually and physically impossible. But both were, in those\r\nignorant and superstitions times, easily credited as proofs of\r\nguilt.\xe2\x80\x94The first class set forth, that Rebecca was heard to mutter to\r\nherself in an unknown tongue\xe2\x80\x94that the songs she sung by fits were of a\r\nstrangely sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer tingle, and\r\nhis heart throb\xe2\x80\x94that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look\r\nupward for a reply\xe2\x80\x94that her garments were of a strange and mystic form,\r\nunlike those of women of good repute\xe2\x80\x94that she had rings impressed with\r\ncabalistical devices, and that strange characters were broidered on her\r\nveil.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances, so natural and so trivial, were gravely\r\nlistened to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions\r\nthat Rebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.\r\n\r\nBut there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of the\r\nassembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however\r\nincredible. One of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded\r\nman, brought with them to the castle of Torquilstone. She did, he said,\r\nmake certain signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious\r\nwords, which he blessed God he understood not, when the iron head of a\r\nsquare cross-bow bolt disengaged itself from the wound, the bleeding\r\nwas stanched, the wound was closed, and the dying man was, within a\r\nquarter of an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the\r\nwitness in managing a mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. This\r\nlegend was probably founded upon the fact, that Rebecca had attended on\r\nthe wounded Ivanhoe when in the castle of Torquilstone. But it was the\r\nmore difficult to dispute the accuracy of the witness, as, in order to\r\nproduce real evidence in support of his verbal testimony, he drew from\r\nhis pouch the very bolt-head, which, according to his story, had been\r\nmiraculously extracted from the wound; and as the iron weighed a full\r\nounce, it completely confirmed the tale, however marvellous.\r\n\r\nHis comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the\r\nscene betwixt Rebecca and Bois-Guilbert, when she was upon the point of\r\nprecipitating herself from the top of the tower. Not to be behind his\r\ncompanion, this fellow stated, that he had seen Rebecca perch herself\r\nupon the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white\r\nswan, under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle\r\nof Torquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume\r\nthe female form.\r\n\r\nLess than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient\r\nto convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a\r\nJewess. United with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too\r\nweighty for Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s youth, though combined with the most exquisite\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn tone\r\ndemanded of Rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of\r\ncondemnation, which he was about to pronounce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo invoke your pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lovely Jewess, with a voice somewhat\r\ntremulous with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cwould, I am aware, be as useless as I should\r\nhold it mean. To state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another\r\nreligion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged Founder of both our\r\nfaiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men\r\n(whom may Heaven pardon!) have spoken against me are impossible, would\r\navail me but little, since you believe in their possibility; and still\r\nless would it advantage me to explain, that the peculiarities of my\r\ndress, language, and manners, are those of my people\xe2\x80\x94I had well-nigh\r\nsaid of my country, but alas! we have no country. Nor will I even\r\nvindicate myself at the expense of my oppressor, who stands there\r\nlistening to the fictions and surmises which seem to convert the tyrant\r\ninto the victim.\xe2\x80\x94God be judge between him and me! but rather would I\r\nsubmit to ten such deaths as your pleasure may denounce against me,\r\nthan listen to the suit which that man of Belial has urged upon\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94friendless, defenceless, and his prisoner. But he is of your own\r\nfaith, and his lightest affirmance would weigh down the most solemn\r\nprotestations of the distressed Jewess. I will not therefore return to\r\nhimself the charge brought against me\xe2\x80\x94but to himself\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, to thyself I appeal, whether these accusations are not\r\nfalse? as monstrous and calumnious as they are deadly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; all eyes turned to Brain de Bois-Guilbert. He was\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou art a man\xe2\x80\x94if thou art a Christian, speak!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nconjure thee, by the habit which thou dost wear, by the name thou dost\r\ninherit\xe2\x80\x94by the knighthood thou dost vaunt\xe2\x80\x94by the honour of thy\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94by the tomb and the bones of thy father\xe2\x80\x94I conjure thee to say,\r\nare these things true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer her, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cif the Enemy with whom\r\nthou dost wrestle will give thee power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, Bois-Guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which\r\nalmost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that\r\nat last he replied, looking to Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe scroll!\xe2\x80\x94the scroll!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is indeed testimony! The victim of her\r\nwitcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which\r\nis, doubtless, the cause of his silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were\r\nfrom Bois-Guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment\r\nwhich she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in\r\nthe Arabian character, \xe2\x80\x9cDemand a Champion!\xe2\x80\x9d The murmuring commentary\r\nwhich ran through the assembly at the strange reply of Bois-Guilbert,\r\ngave Rebecca leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll\r\nunobserved. When the whisper had ceased, the Grand Master spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this\r\nunhappy knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the Enemy is yet too\r\npowerful. Hast thou aught else to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is yet one chance of life left to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9ceven by\r\nyour own fierce laws. Life has been miserable\xe2\x80\x94miserable, at least, of\r\nlate\xe2\x80\x94but I will not cast away the gift of God, while he affords me the\r\nmeans of defending it. I deny this charge\xe2\x80\x94I maintain my innocence, and\r\nI declare the falsehood of this accusation\xe2\x80\x94I challenge the privilege of\r\ntrial by combat, and will appear by my champion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cwill lay lance in rest\r\nfor a sorceress? who will be the champion of a Jewess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod will raise me up a champion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be that in\r\nmerry England\xe2\x80\x94the hospitable, the generous, the free, where so many are\r\nready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found one to\r\nfight for justice. But it is enough that I challenge the trial by\r\ncombat\xe2\x80\x94there lies my gage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before\r\nthe Grand Master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which\r\nexcited universal surprise and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There I throw my gage,\r\nTo prove it on thee to the extremest point\r\nOf martial daring.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD II\r\n\r\n\r\nEven Lucas Beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance\r\nof Rebecca. He was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but\r\nwith passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense\r\nof duty, his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life\r\nwhich he pursued, the supreme power which he enjoyed, and the supposed\r\nnecessity of subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy, which he\r\nconceived peculiarly incumbent on him. His features relaxed in their\r\nusual severity as he gazed upon the beautiful creature before him,\r\nalone, unfriended, and defending herself with so much spirit and\r\ncourage. He crossed himself twice, as doubting whence arose the\r\nunwonted softening of a heart, which on such occasions used to resemble\r\nin hardness the steel of his sword. At length he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamsel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif the pity I feel for thee arise from any practice\r\nthine evil arts have made on me, great is thy guilt. But I rather judge\r\nit the kinder feelings of nature, which grieves that so goodly a form\r\nshould be a vessel of perdition. Repent, my daughter\xe2\x80\x94confess thy\r\nwitchcrafts\xe2\x80\x94turn thee from thine evil faith\xe2\x80\x94embrace this holy emblem,\r\nand all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter. In some\r\nsisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and\r\nfitting penance, and that repentance not to be repented of. This do and\r\nlive\xe2\x80\x94what has the law of Moses done for thee that thou shouldest die\r\nfor it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the law of my fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cit was delivered in\r\nthunders and in storms upon the mountain of Sinai, in cloud and in\r\nfire. This, if ye are Christians, ye believe\xe2\x80\x94it is, you say, recalled;\r\nbut so my teachers have not taught me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet our chaplain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir, \xe2\x80\x9cstand forth, and tell this\r\nobstinate infidel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive the interruption,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, meekly; \xe2\x80\x9cI am a maiden,\r\nunskilled to dispute for my religion, but I can die for it, if it be\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s will.\xe2\x80\x94Let me pray your answer to my demand of a champion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me her glove,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nas he looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers, \xe2\x80\x9ca slight and\r\nfrail gage for a purpose so deadly!\xe2\x80\x94Seest thou, Rebecca, as this thin\r\nand light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets, so is\r\nthy cause to that of the Temple, for it is our Order which thou hast\r\ndefied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCast my innocence into the scale,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand the glove of\r\nsilk shall outweigh the glove of iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in\r\nthat bold challenge which thou hast made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do persist, noble sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it then, in the name of Heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cand may\r\nGod show the right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Preceptors around him, and the word was deeply\r\nechoed by the whole assembly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrethren,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beaumanoir, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are aware that we might well have\r\nrefused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat\xe2\x80\x94but though a\r\nJewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and\r\nGod forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that\r\nit should be refused to her. Moreover, we are knights and soldiers as\r\nwell as men of religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to\r\nrefuse proffered combat. Thus, therefore, stands the case. Rebecca, the\r\ndaughter of Isaac of York, is, by many frequent and suspicious\r\ncircumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble\r\nknight of our holy Order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of\r\nher innocence. To whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we\r\nshould deliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the same time, to be\r\nour champion on the field?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Brian de Bois-Guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nPreceptor of Goodalricke, \xe2\x80\x9cand who, moreover, best knows how the truth\r\nstands in this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cour brother Brian be under the\r\ninfluence of a charm or a spell\xe2\x80\x94we speak but for the sake of\r\nprecaution, for to the arm of none of our holy Order would we more\r\nwillingly confide this or a more weighty cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Preceptor of Goodalricke, \xe2\x80\x9cno spell can\r\neffect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayest right, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master. \xe2\x80\x9cAlbert Malvoisin,\r\ngive this gage of battle to Brian de Bois-Guilbert.\xe2\x80\x94It is our charge to\r\nthee, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing himself to Bois-Guilbert,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause\r\nshall triumph.\xe2\x80\x94And do thou, Rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the\r\nthird day from the present to find a champion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is but brief space,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a stranger, who is\r\nalso of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life\r\nand honour for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved\r\nsoldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may not extend it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cthe field must be\r\nfoughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the\r\nfourth day from hence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cI put my trust in Him, to whom an\r\ninstant is as effectual to save as a whole age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast spoken well, damsel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cbut well know\r\nwe who can array himself like an angel of light. It remains but to name\r\na fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.\xe2\x80\x94Where\r\nis the Preceptor of this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlbert Malvoisin, still holding Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s glove in his hand, was\r\nspeaking to Bois-Guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cwill he not receive the gage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will\xe2\x80\x94he doth, most Reverend Father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin, slipping the\r\nglove under his own mantle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for the place of combat, I hold the\r\nfittest to be the lists of Saint George belonging to this Preceptory,\r\nand used by us for military exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca, in those lists shalt\r\nthou produce thy champion; and if thou failest to do so, or if thy\r\nchampion shall be discomfited by the judgment of God, thou shalt then\r\ndie the death of a sorceress, according to doom.\xe2\x80\x94Let this our judgment\r\nbe recorded, and the record read aloud, that no one may pretend\r\nignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately\r\nengrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings\r\nof the Templar Knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and\r\nwhen he had finished writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the\r\nGrand Master, which, when translated from the Norman-French in which it\r\nwas couched, was expressed as follows.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca, a Jewess, daughter of Isaac of York, being attainted of\r\nsorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a Knight\r\nof the most Holy Order of the Temple of Zion, doth deny the same; and\r\nsaith, that the testimony delivered against her this day is false,\r\nwicked, and disloyal; and that by lawful \xe2\x80\x98essoine\xe2\x80\x99 54 of her body as\r\nbeing unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion\r\ninstead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal \xe2\x80\x98devoir\xe2\x80\x99\r\nin all knightly sort, with such arms as to gage of battle do fully\r\nappertain, and that at her peril and cost. And therewith she proffered\r\nher gage. And the gage having been delivered to the noble Lord and\r\nKnight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, of the Holy Order of the Temple of\r\nZion, he was appointed to do this battle, in behalf of his Order and\r\nhimself, as injured and impaired by the practices of the appellant.\r\nWherefore the most reverend Father and puissant Lord, Lucas Marquis of\r\nBeaumanoir, did allow of the said challenge, and of the said \xe2\x80\x98essoine\xe2\x80\x99\r\nof the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s body, and assigned the third day for the said\r\ncombat, the place being the enclosure called the lists of Saint George,\r\nnear to the Preceptory of Templestowe. And the Grand Master appoints\r\nthe appellant to appear there by her champion, on pain of doom, as a\r\nperson convicted of sorcery or seduction; and also the defendant so to\r\nappear, under the penalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case\r\nof default; and the noble Lord and most reverend Father aforesaid\r\nappointed the battle to be done in his own presence, and according to\r\nall that is commendable and profitable in such a case. And may God aid\r\nthe just cause!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; and the word was echoed by all around.\r\nRebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and, folding her hands,\r\nremained for a minute without change of attitude. She then modestly\r\nreminded the Grand Master, that she ought to be permitted some\r\nopportunity of free communication with her friends, for the purpose of\r\nmaking her condition known to them, and procuring, if possible, some\r\nchampion to fight in her behalf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just and lawful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master; \xe2\x80\x9cchoose what messenger\r\nthou shalt trust, and he shall have free communication with thee in thy\r\nprison-chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cany one here, who, either for love of a good\r\ncause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressed being?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the Grand\r\nMaster, to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lest he\r\nshould be suspected of leaning towards Judaism. Not even the prospect\r\nof reward, far less any feelings of compassion alone, could surmount\r\nthis apprehension.\r\n\r\nRebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it really thus?\xe2\x80\x94And, in English land, am I to be\r\ndeprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of\r\nan act of charity which would not be refused to the worst criminal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHigg, the son of Snell, at length replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI am but a maimed man, but\r\nthat I can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable\r\nassistance.\xe2\x80\x94I will do thine errand,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nwell as a crippled object can, and happy were my limbs fleet enough to\r\nrepair the mischief done by my tongue. Alas! when I boasted of thy\r\ncharity, I little thought I was leading thee into danger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cis the disposer of all. He can turn back the\r\ncaptivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute his\r\nmessage the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac\r\nof York\xe2\x80\x94here is that will pay for horse and man\xe2\x80\x94let him have this\r\nscroll.\xe2\x80\x94I know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me, but\r\nmost truly do I judge that I am not to die this death, and that a\r\nchampion will be raised up for me. Farewell!\xe2\x80\x94Life and death are in thy\r\nhaste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe peasant took the scroll, which contained only a few lines in\r\nHebrew. Many of the crowd would have dissuaded him from touching a\r\ndocument so suspicious; but Higg was resolute in the service of his\r\nbenefactress. She had saved his body, he said, and he was confident she\r\ndid not mean to peril his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will get me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy neighbour Buthan\xe2\x80\x99s good capul, 55 and I\r\nwill be at York within as brief space as man and beast may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as it fortuned, he had no occasion to go so far, for within a\r\nquarter of a mile from the gate of the Preceptory he met with two\r\nriders, whom, by their dress and their huge yellow caps, he knew to be\r\nJews; and, on approaching more nearly, discovered that one of them was\r\nhis ancient employer, Isaac of York. The other was the Rabbi Ben\r\nSamuel; and both had approached as near to the Preceptory as they\r\ndared, on hearing that the Grand Master had summoned a chapter for the\r\ntrial of a sorceress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother Ben Samuel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cmy soul is disquieted, and I wot not\r\nwhy. This charge of necromancy is right often used for cloaking evil\r\npractices on our people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe of good comfort, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician; \xe2\x80\x9cthou canst deal\r\nwith the Nazarenes as one possessing the mammon of unrighteousness, and\r\ncanst therefore purchase immunity at their hands\xe2\x80\x94it rules the savage\r\nminds of those ungodly men, even as the signet of the mighty Solomon\r\nwas said to command the evil genii.\xe2\x80\x94But what poor wretch comes hither\r\nupon his crutches, desiring, as I think, some speech of me?\xe2\x80\x94Friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the physician, addressing Higg, the son of Snell, \xe2\x80\x9cI refuse\r\nthee not the aid of mine art, but I relieve not with one asper those\r\nwho beg for alms upon the highway. Out upon thee!\xe2\x80\x94Hast thou the palsy\r\nin thy legs? then let thy hands work for thy livelihood; for, albeit\r\nthou be\xe2\x80\x99st unfit for a speedy post, or for a careful shepherd, or for\r\nthe warfare, or for the service of a hasty master, yet there be\r\noccupations\xe2\x80\x94How now, brother?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, interrupting his harangue to\r\nlook towards Isaac, who had but glanced at the scroll which Higg\r\noffered, when, uttering a deep groan, he fell from his mule like a\r\ndying man, and lay for a minute insensible.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi now dismounted in great alarm, and hastily applied the\r\nremedies which his art suggested for the recovery of his companion. He\r\nhad even taken from his pocket a cupping apparatus, and was about to\r\nproceed to phlebotomy, when the object of his anxious solicitude\r\nsuddenly revived; but it was to dash his cap from his head, and to\r\nthrow dust on his grey hairs. The physician was at first inclined to\r\nascribe this sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity;\r\nand, adhering to his original purpose, began once again to handle his\r\nimplements. But Isaac soon convinced him of his error.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChild of my sorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwell shouldst thou be called Benoni,\r\ninstead of Rebecca! Why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to\r\nthe grave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, I curse God and die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rabbi, in great surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cart thou a father in\r\nIsrael, and dost thou utter words like unto these?\xe2\x80\x94I trust that the\r\nchild of thy house yet liveth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe liveth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is as Daniel, who was called\r\nBeltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. She is captive\r\nunto those men of Belial, and they will wreak their cruelty upon her,\r\nsparing neither for her youth nor her comely favour. O! she was as a\r\ncrown of green palms to my grey locks; and she must wither in a night,\r\nlike the gourd of Jonah!\xe2\x80\x94Child of my love!\xe2\x80\x94child of my old age!\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\nRebecca, daughter of Rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath\r\nencompassed thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet read the scroll,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rabbi; \xe2\x80\x9cperadventure it may be that we\r\nmay yet find out a way of deliverance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo thou read, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cfor mine eyes are as a\r\nfountain of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician read, but in their native language, the following words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Isaac, the son of Adonikam, whom the Gentiles call Isaac of York,\r\npeace and the blessing of the promise be multiplied unto thee!\xe2\x80\x94My\r\nfather, I am as one doomed to die for that which my soul knoweth\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94even for the crime of witchcraft. My father, if a strong man can be\r\nfound to do battle for my cause with sword and spear, according to the\r\ncustom of the Nazarenes, and that within the lists of Templestowe, on\r\nthe third day from this time, peradventure our fathers\xe2\x80\x99 God will give\r\nhim strength to defend the innocent, and her who hath none to help her.\r\nBut if this may not be, let the virgins of our people mourn for me as\r\nfor one cast off, and for the hart that is stricken by the hunter, and\r\nfor the flower which is cut down by the scythe of the mower. Wherefore\r\nlook now what thou doest, and whether there be any rescue. One Nazarene\r\nwarrior might indeed bear arms in my behalf, even Wilfred, son of\r\nCedric, whom the Gentiles call Ivanhoe. But he may not yet endure the\r\nweight of his armour. Nevertheless, send the tidings unto him, my\r\nfather; for he hath favour among the strong men of his people, and as\r\nhe was our companion in the house of bondage, he may find some one to\r\ndo battle for my sake. And say unto him, even unto him, even unto\r\nWilfred, the son of Cedric, that if Rebecca live, or if Rebecca die,\r\nshe liveth or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal. And\r\nif it be the will of God that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter,\r\ndo not thou tarry, old man, in this land of bloodshed and cruelty; but\r\nbetake thyself to Cordova, where thy brother liveth in safety, under\r\nthe shadow of the throne, even of the throne of Boabdil the Saracen;\r\nfor less cruel are the cruelties of the Moors unto the race of Jacob,\r\nthan the cruelties of the Nazarenes of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIsaac listened with tolerable composure while Ben Samuel read the\r\nletter, and then again resumed the gestures and exclamations of\r\nOriental sorrow, tearing his garments, besprinkling his head with dust,\r\nand ejaculating, \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter! my daughter! flesh of my flesh, and bone\r\nof my bone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rabbi, \xe2\x80\x9ctake courage, for this grief availeth nothing.\r\nGird up thy loins, and seek out this Wilfred, the son of Cedric. It may\r\nbe he will help thee with counsel or with strength; for the youth hath\r\nfavour in the eyes of Richard, called of the Nazarenes C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion,\r\nand the tidings that he hath returned are constant in the land. It may\r\nbe that he may obtain his letter, and his signet, commanding these men\r\nof blood, who take their name from the Temple to the dishonour thereof,\r\nthat they proceed not in their purposed wickedness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will seek him out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he is a good youth, and hath\r\ncompassion for the exile of Jacob. But he cannot bear his armour, and\r\nwhat other Christian shall do battle for the oppressed of Zion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rabbi, \xe2\x80\x9cthou speakest as one that knoweth not the\r\nGentiles. With gold shalt thou buy their valour, even as with gold thou\r\nbuyest thine own safety. Be of good courage, and do thou set forward to\r\nfind out this Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I will also up and be doing, for\r\ngreat sin it were to leave thee in thy calamity. I will hie me to the\r\ncity of York, where many warriors and strong men are assembled, and\r\ndoubt not I will find among them some one who will do battle for thy\r\ndaughter; for gold is their god, and for riches will they pawn their\r\nlives as well as their lands.\xe2\x80\x94Thou wilt fulfil, my brother, such\r\npromise as I may make unto them in thy name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cand Heaven be praised that raised me\r\nup a comforter in my misery. Howbeit, grant them not their full demand\r\nat once, for thou shalt find it the quality of this accursed people\r\nthat they will ask pounds, and peradventure accept of\r\nounces\xe2\x80\x94Nevertheless, be it as thou willest, for I am distracted in this\r\nthing, and what would my gold avail me if the child of my love should\r\nperish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the physician, \xe2\x80\x9cand may it be to thee as thy heart\r\ndesireth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey embraced accordingly, and departed on their several roads. The\r\ncrippled peasant remained for some time looking after them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese dog-Jews!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cto take no more notice of a free\r\nguild-brother, than if I were a bond slave or a Turk, or a circumcised\r\nHebrew like themselves! They might have flung me a mancus or two,\r\nhowever. I was not obliged to bring their unhallowed scrawls, and run\r\nthe risk of being bewitched, as more folks than one told me. And what\r\ncare I for the bit of gold that the wench gave me, if I am to come to\r\nharm from the priest next Easter at confession, and be obliged to give\r\nhim twice as much to make it up with him, and be called the Jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflying post all my life, as it may hap, into the bargain? I think I was\r\nbewitched in earnest when I was beside that girl!\xe2\x80\x94But it was always so\r\nwith Jew or Gentile, whosoever came near her\xe2\x80\x94none could stay when she\r\nhad an errand to go\xe2\x80\x94and still, whenever I think of her, I would give\r\nshop and tools to save her life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nO maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,\r\nMy bosom is proud as thine own.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be called\r\nsuch, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door of\r\nRebecca\xe2\x80\x99s prison-chamber. It disturbed not the inmate, who was then\r\nengaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which\r\nconcluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into English.\r\n\r\nWhen Israel, of the Lord beloved,\r\n    Out of the land of bondage came,\r\nHer father\xe2\x80\x99s God before her moved,\r\n    An awful guide, in smoke and flame.\r\nBy day, along the astonish\xe2\x80\x99d lands\r\n    The cloudy pillar glided slow;\r\nBy night, Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s crimson\xe2\x80\x99d sands\r\n    Return\xe2\x80\x99d the fiery column\xe2\x80\x99s glow.\r\n\r\nThere rose the choral hymn of praise,\r\n    And trump and timbrel answer\xe2\x80\x99d keen,\r\nAnd Zion\xe2\x80\x99s daughters pour\xe2\x80\x99d their lays,\r\n    With priest\xe2\x80\x99s and warrior\xe2\x80\x99s voice between.\r\nNo portents now our foes amaze,\r\n    Forsaken Israel wanders lone;\r\nOur fathers would not know THY ways,\r\n    And THOU hast left them to their own.\r\n\r\nBut, present still, though now unseen;\r\n    When brightly shines the prosperous day,\r\nBe thoughts of THEE a cloudy screen\r\n    To temper the deceitful ray.\r\nAnd oh, when stoops on Judah\xe2\x80\x99s path\r\n    In shade and storm the frequent night,\r\nBe THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,\r\n    A burning, and a shining light!\r\n\r\nOur harps we left by Babel\xe2\x80\x99s streams,\r\n    The tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s jest, the Gentile\xe2\x80\x99s scorn;\r\nNo censer round our altar beams,\r\n    And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.\r\nBut THOU hast said, the blood of goat,\r\n    The flesh of rams, I will not prize;\r\nA contrite heart, and humble thought,\r\n    Are mine accepted sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sounds of Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s devotional hymn had died away in silence,\r\nthe low knock at the door was again renewed. \xe2\x80\x9cEnter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nthou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy\r\nentrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian de Bois-Guilbert, entering the apartment, \xe2\x80\x9cfriend or\r\nfoe, Rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she\r\nconsidered as the root of her misfortunes, Rebecca drew backward with a\r\ncautious and alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest\r\ncorner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she\r\ncould, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible.\r\nShe drew herself into an attitude not of defiance, but of resolution,\r\nas one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel\r\nit, being offered, to the utmost of her power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no reason to fear me, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cor if I\r\nmust so qualify my speech, you have at least NOW no reason to fear me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear you not, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca, although her short-drawn\r\nbreath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; \xe2\x80\x9cmy trust is strong,\r\nand I fear thee not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no cause,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bois-Guilbert, gravely; \xe2\x80\x9cmy former\r\nfrantic attempts you have not now to dread. Within your call are\r\nguards, over whom I have no authority. They are designed to conduct you\r\nto death, Rebecca, yet would not suffer you to be insulted by any one,\r\neven by me, were my frenzy\xe2\x80\x94for frenzy it is\xe2\x80\x94to urge me so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay Heaven be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess; \xe2\x80\x9cdeath is the least of my\r\napprehensions in this den of evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cthe idea of death is easily received by the\r\ncourageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. A thrust with\r\na lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little\xe2\x80\x94To you, a spring from\r\na dizzy battlement, a stroke with a sharp poniard, has no terrors,\r\ncompared with what either thinks disgrace. Mark me\xe2\x80\x94I say this\xe2\x80\x94perhaps\r\nmine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic, Rebecca, than\r\nthine are; but we know alike how to die for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess; \xe2\x80\x9cand art thou condemned to expose thy\r\nlife for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge\r\nthe solidity? Surely this is a parting with your treasure for that\r\nwhich is not bread\xe2\x80\x94but deem not so of me. Thy resolution may fluctuate\r\non the wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is\r\nanchored on the Rock of Ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9csuch discourse now avails but\r\nlittle. Thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such as\r\nmisery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted\r\ncourse of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men\r\ncalls thy crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to whom\xe2\x80\x94if such my fate\xe2\x80\x94to whom do I owe this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csurely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal cause, dragged\r\nme hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own, strives to\r\nexaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have so exposed thee; I would\r\nhave bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as\r\never I exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI had thanked thee for thy care\xe2\x80\x94as it is, thou hast claimed\r\nmerit for it so often, that I tell thee life is worth nothing to me,\r\npreserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruce with thine upbraidings, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cI have my\r\nown cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is thy purpose, then, Sir Knight?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess; \xe2\x80\x9cspeak it\r\nbriefly.\xe2\x80\x94If thou hast aught to do, save to witness the misery thou hast\r\ncaused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94the step between time and eternity is short but terrible, and I\r\nhave few moments to prepare for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perceive, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thou dost continue to\r\nburden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would I have\r\nprevented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI would avoid reproaches\xe2\x80\x94But what is more\r\ncertain than that I owe my death to thine unbridled passion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou err\xe2\x80\x94you err,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said the Templar, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9cif you impute what I\r\ncould neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency.\xe2\x80\x94Could I\r\nguess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some flashes of\r\nfrantic valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid\r\nself-torments of an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own\r\nmerits, above common sense, above me, and above the hundreds of our\r\nOrder, who think and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic\r\nprejudices as are the grounds of his opinions and actions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cyou sate a judge upon me, innocent\xe2\x80\x94most\r\ninnocent\xe2\x80\x94as you knew me to be\xe2\x80\x94you concurred in my condemnation, and, if\r\nI aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to assert my guilt,\r\nand assure my punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy patience, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar. \xe2\x80\x9cNo race knows so well as\r\nthine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their bark\r\nas to make advantage even of an adverse wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLamented be the hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthat has taught such art to the\r\nHouse of Israel! but adversity bends the heart as fire bends the\r\nstubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and\r\nthe denizens of their own free independent state, must crouch before\r\nstrangers. It is our curse, Sir Knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own\r\nmisdeeds and those of our fathers; but you\xe2\x80\x94you who boast your freedom\r\nas your birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to\r\nsoothe the prejudices of others, and that against your own conviction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour words are bitter, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, pacing the\r\napartment with impatience, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I came not hither to bandy reproaches\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x94Know that Bois-Guilbert yields not to created man, although\r\ncircumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan. His will is\r\nthe mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space\r\naside by the rock, but fails not to find its course to the ocean. That\r\nscroll which warned thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou\r\nthink it came, if not from Bois-Guilbert? In whom else couldst thou\r\nhave excited such interest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA brief respite from instant death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich will little\r\navail me\xe2\x80\x94was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head thou hast\r\nheaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the\r\ntomb?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthis was NOT all that I purposed. Had\r\nit not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard, and\r\nthe fool of Goodalricke, who, being a Templar, affects to think and\r\njudge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the\r\nChampion Defender had devolved, not on a Preceptor, but on a Companion\r\nof the Order. Then I myself\xe2\x80\x94such was my purpose\xe2\x80\x94had, on the sounding of\r\nthe trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed in\r\nthe fashion of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his\r\nshield and spear; and then, let Beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two\r\nor three of the brethren here assembled, I had not doubted to cast them\r\nout of the saddle with my single lance. Thus, Rebecca, should thine\r\ninnocence have been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would I have\r\ntrusted for the reward of my victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cis but idle boasting\xe2\x80\x94a brag of what\r\nyou would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise.\r\nYou received my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can\r\nfind one, must encounter your lance in the lists\xe2\x80\x94yet you would assume\r\nthe air of my friend and protector!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy friend and protector,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cI will yet\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94but mark at what risk, or rather at what certainty, of dishonour;\r\nand then blame me not if I make my stipulations, before I offer up all\r\nthat I have hitherto held dear, to save the life of a Jewish maiden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9cI understand thee not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cI will speak as freely as ever did\r\ndoting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky\r\nconfessional.\xe2\x80\x94Rebecca, if I appear not in these lists I lose fame and\r\nrank\xe2\x80\x94lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, I mean,\r\nin which I am held by my brethren, and the hopes I have of succeeding\r\nto that mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard\r\nLucas de Beaumanoir, but of which I should make a different use. Such\r\nis my certain doom, except I appear in arms against thy cause. Accursed\r\nbe he of Goodalricke, who baited this trap for me! and doubly accursed\r\nAlbert de Malvoisin, who withheld me from the resolution I had formed,\r\nof hurling back the glove at the face of the superstitious and\r\nsuperannuated fool, who listened to a charge so absurd, and against a\r\ncreature so high in mind, and so lovely in form as thou art!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what now avails rant or flattery?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca. \xe2\x80\x9cThou hast\r\nmade thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent\r\nwoman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes\xe2\x80\x94What\r\navails it to reckon together?\xe2\x80\x94thy choice is made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer\r\ntowards her; \xe2\x80\x9cmy choice is NOT made\xe2\x80\x94nay, mark, it is thine to make the\r\nelection. If I appear in the lists, I must maintain my name in arms;\r\nand if I do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and\r\nfaggot, for there lives not the knight who hath coped with me in arms\r\non equal issue, or on terms of vantage, save Richard C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion, and\r\nhis minion of Ivanhoe. Ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear\r\nhis corslet, and Richard is in a foreign prison. If I appear, then thou\r\ndiest, even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth\r\nto enter the lists in thy defence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what avails repeating this so often?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cfor thou must learn to look at thy fate\r\non every side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, turn the tapestry,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me see the\r\nother side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I appear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert, \xe2\x80\x9cin the fatal lists, thou diest by a\r\nslow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the\r\nguilty hereafter. But if I appear not, then am I a degraded and\r\ndishonoured knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with\r\ninfidels\xe2\x80\x94the illustrious name which has grown yet more so under my\r\nwearing, becomes a hissing and a reproach. I lose fame, I lose honour,\r\nI lose the prospect of such greatness as scarce emperors attain to\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsacrifice mighty ambition, I destroy schemes built as high as the\r\nmountains with which heathens say their heaven was once nearly\r\nscaled\xe2\x80\x94and yet, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, throwing himself at her feet, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\ngreatness will I sacrifice, this fame will I renounce, this power will\r\nI forego, even now when it is half within my grasp, if thou wilt say,\r\nBois-Guilbert, I receive thee for my lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink not of such foolishness, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nhasten to the Regent, the Queen Mother, and to Prince John\xe2\x80\x94they cannot,\r\nin honour to the English crown, allow of the proceedings of your Grand\r\nMaster. So shall you give me protection without sacrifice on your part,\r\nor the pretext of requiring any requital from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith these I deal not,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, holding the train of her\r\nrobe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit is thee only I address; and what can counterbalance thy\r\nchoice? Bethink thee, were I a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is\r\ndeath who is my rival.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI weigh not these evils,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild\r\nknight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even\r\nfeign to endure it. \xe2\x80\x9cBe a man, be a Christian! If indeed thy faith\r\nrecommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions\r\npretend, save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital\r\nwhich would change thy magnanimity into base barter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, damsel!\xe2\x80\x9d said the proud Templar, springing up, \xe2\x80\x9cthou shalt not\r\nthus impose on me\xe2\x80\x94if I renounce present fame and future ambition, I\r\nrenounce it for thy sake, and we will escape in company. Listen to me,\r\nRebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, again softening his tone; \xe2\x80\x9cEngland,\xe2\x80\x94Europe,\xe2\x80\x94is not\r\nthe world. There are spheres in which we may act, ample enough even for\r\nmy ambition. We will go to Palestine, where Conrade, Marquis of\r\nMontserrat, is my friend\xe2\x80\x94a friend free as myself from the doting\r\nscruples which fetter our free-born reason\xe2\x80\x94rather with Saladin will we\r\nleague ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we\r\ncontemn.\xe2\x80\x94I will form new paths to greatness,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, again\r\ntraversing the room with hasty strides\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEurope shall hear the loud step\r\nof him she has driven from her sons!\xe2\x80\x94Not the millions whom her\r\ncrusaders send to slaughter, can do so much to defend Palestine\xe2\x80\x94not the\r\nsabres of the thousands and ten thousands of Saracens can hew their way\r\nso deep into that land for which nations are striving, as the strength\r\nand policy of me and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old\r\nbigot, will adhere to me in good and evil. Thou shalt be a queen,\r\nRebecca\xe2\x80\x94on Mount Carmel shall we pitch the throne which my valour will\r\ngain for you, and I will exchange my long-desired batoon for a\r\nsceptre!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca; \xe2\x80\x9can empty vision of the night, which, were it\r\na waking reality, affects me not. Enough, that the power which thou\r\nmightest acquire, I will never share; nor hold I so light of country or\r\nreligious faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties,\r\nand cast away the bonds of the Order of which he is a sworn member, in\r\norder to gratify an unruly passion for the daughter of another\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x94Put not a price on my deliverance, Sir Knight\xe2\x80\x94sell not a deed\r\nof generosity\xe2\x80\x94protect the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not\r\nfor a selfish advantage\xe2\x80\x94Go to the throne of England; Richard will\r\nlisten to my appeal from these cruel men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Rebecca!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I renounce my Order,\r\nfor thee alone will I renounce it\xe2\x80\x94Ambition shall remain mine, if thou\r\nrefuse my love; I will not be fooled on all hands.\xe2\x80\x94Stoop my crest to\r\nRichard?\xe2\x80\x94ask a boon of that heart of pride?\xe2\x80\x94Never, Rebecca, will I\r\nplace the Order of the Temple at his feet in my person. I may forsake\r\nthe Order, I never will degrade or betray it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow God be gracious to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the succour of man is\r\nwell-nigh hopeless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, proud as thou art, thou hast in\r\nme found thy match. If I enter the lists with my spear in rest, think\r\nnot any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength;\r\nand think then upon thine own fate\xe2\x80\x94to die the dreadful death of the\r\nworst of criminals\xe2\x80\x94to be consumed upon a blazing pile\xe2\x80\x94dispersed to the\r\nelements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed\xe2\x80\x94not a\r\nrelic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived\r\nand moved!\xe2\x80\x94Rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect\xe2\x80\x94thou\r\nwilt yield to my suit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBois-Guilbert,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Jewess, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest not the heart of\r\nwoman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best\r\nfeelings. I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles\r\nhast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown by\r\nwoman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. I am myself a\r\nwoman, tenderly nurtured, naturally fearful of danger, and impatient of\r\npain\xe2\x80\x94yet, when we enter those fatal lists, thou to fight and I to\r\nsuffer, I feel the strong assurance within me, that my courage shall\r\nmount higher than thine. Farewell\xe2\x80\x94I waste no more words on thee; the\r\ntime that remains on earth to the daughter of Jacob must be otherwise\r\nspent\xe2\x80\x94she must seek the Comforter, who may hide his face from his\r\npeople, but who ever opens his ear to the cry of those who seek him in\r\nsincerity and in truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe part then thus?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, after a short pause; \xe2\x80\x9cwould to\r\nHeaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in birth\r\nand Christian in faith!\xe2\x80\x94Nay, by Heaven! when I gaze on thee, and think\r\nwhen and how we are next to meet, I could even wish myself one of thine\r\nown degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels,\r\ninstead of spear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble,\r\nand my look only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor\xe2\x80\x94this\r\ncould I wish, Rebecca, to be near to thee in life, and to escape the\r\nfearful share I must have in thy death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast spoken the Jew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cas the persecution of such\r\nas thou art has made him. Heaven in ire has driven him from his\r\ncountry, but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to\r\ninfluence, which oppression has left unbarred. Read the ancient history\r\nof the people of God, and tell me if those, by whom Jehovah wrought\r\nsuch marvels among the nations, were then a people of misers and of\r\nusurers!\xe2\x80\x94And know, proud knight, we number names amongst us to which\r\nyour boasted northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the\r\ncedar\xe2\x80\x94names that ascend far back to those high times when the Divine\r\nPresence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and which derive\r\ntheir splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful Voice, which\r\nbade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the Vision\xe2\x80\x94Such\r\nwere the princes of the House of Jacob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRebecca\xe2\x80\x99s colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race,\r\nbut faded as she added, with at sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch WERE the princes of Judah,\r\nnow such no more!\xe2\x80\x94They are trampled down like the shorn grass, and\r\nmixed with the mire of the ways. Yet are there those among them who\r\nshame not such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of Isaac\r\nthe son of Adonikam! Farewell!\xe2\x80\x94I envy not thy blood-won honours\xe2\x80\x94I envy\r\nnot thy barbarous descent from northern heathens\xe2\x80\x94I envy thee not thy\r\nfaith, which is ever in thy mouth, but never in thy heart nor in thy\r\npractice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a spell on me, by Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost\r\nthink yon besotted skeleton spoke truth, and that the reluctance with\r\nwhich I part from thee hath something in it more than is natural.\xe2\x80\x94Fair\r\ncreature!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, approaching near her, but with great respect,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso\r\nyoung, so beautiful, so fearless of death! and yet doomed to die, and\r\nwith infamy and agony. Who would not weep for thee?\xe2\x80\x94The tear, that has\r\nbeen a stranger to these eyelids for twenty years, moistens them as I\r\ngaze on thee. But it must be\xe2\x80\x94nothing may now save thy life. Thou and I\r\nare but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that\r\nhurries us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm, which\r\nare dashed against each other, and so perish. Forgive me, then, and let\r\nus part, at least, as friends part. I have assailed thy resolution in\r\nvain, and mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cdo men throw on fate the issue of their own wild\r\npassions. But I do forgive thee, Bois-Guilbert, though the author of my\r\nearly death. There are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind;\r\nbut it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and\r\nconspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cI am, Rebecca, as thou hast spoken me,\r\nuntaught, untamed\xe2\x80\x94and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and\r\ncrafty bigots, I have retained the preeminent fortitude that places me\r\nabove them. I have been a child of battle from my youth upward, high in\r\nmy views, steady and inflexible in pursuing them. Such must I\r\nremain\xe2\x80\x94proud, inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall\r\nhave proof.\xe2\x80\x94But thou forgivest me, Rebecca?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, and left the apartment.\r\n\r\nThe Preceptor Albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the\r\nreturn of Bois-Guilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast tarried long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been as if stretched on\r\nred-hot iron with very impatience. What if the Grand Master, or his spy\r\nConrade, had come hither? I had paid dear for my complaisance.\xe2\x80\x94But what\r\nails thee, brother?\xe2\x80\x94Thy step totters, thy brow is as black as night.\r\nArt thou well, Bois-Guilbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as the wretch who is doomed to die\r\nwithin an hour.\xe2\x80\x94Nay, by the rood, not half so well\xe2\x80\x94for there be those\r\nin such state, who can lay down life like a cast-off garment. By\r\nHeaven, Malvoisin, yonder girl hath well-nigh unmanned me. I am half\r\nresolved to go to the Grand Master, abjure the Order to his very teeth,\r\nand refuse to act the brutality which his tyranny has imposed on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art mad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Malvoisin; \xe2\x80\x9cthou mayst thus indeed utterly\r\nruin thyself, but canst not even find a chance thereby to save the life\r\nof this Jewess, which seems so precious in thine eyes. Beaumanoir will\r\nname another of the Order to defend his judgment in thy place, and the\r\naccused will as assuredly perish as if thou hadst taken the duty\r\nimposed on thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis false\xe2\x80\x94I will myself take arms in her behalf,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nTemplar, haughtily; \xe2\x80\x9cand, should I do so, I think, Malvoisin, that thou\r\nknowest not one of the Order, who will keep his saddle before the point\r\nof my lance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but thou forgettest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wily adviser, \xe2\x80\x9cthou wilt have\r\nneither leisure nor opportunity to execute this mad project. Go to\r\nLucas Beaumanoir, and say thou hast renounced thy vow of obedience, and\r\nsee how long the despotic old man will leave thee in personal freedom.\r\nThe words shall scarce have left thy lips, ere thou wilt either be an\r\nhundred feet under ground, in the dungeon of the Preceptory, to abide\r\ntrial as a recreant knight; or, if his opinion holds concerning thy\r\npossession, thou wilt be enjoying straw, darkness, and chains, in some\r\ndistant convent cell, stunned with exorcisms, and drenched with holy\r\nwater, to expel the foul fiend which hath obtained dominion over thee.\r\nThou must to the lists, Brian, or thou art a lost and dishonoured man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will break forth and fly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfly to some distant\r\nland, to which folly and fanaticism have not yet found their way. No\r\ndrop of the blood of this most excellent creature shall be spilled by\r\nmy sanction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou canst not fly,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor; \xe2\x80\x9cthy ravings have excited\r\nsuspicion, and thou wilt not be permitted to leave the Preceptory. Go\r\nand make the essay\xe2\x80\x94present thyself before the gate, and command the\r\nbridge to be lowered, and mark what answer thou shalt receive.\xe2\x80\x94Thou are\r\nsurprised and offended; but is it not the better for thee? Wert thou to\r\nfly, what would ensue but the reversal of thy arms, the dishonour of\r\nthine ancestry, the degradation of thy rank?\xe2\x80\x94Think on it. Where shall\r\nthine old companions in arms hide their heads when Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, the best lance of the Templars, is proclaimed recreant,\r\namid the hisses of the assembled people? What grief will be at the\r\nCourt of France! With what joy will the haughty Richard hear the news,\r\nthat the knight that set him hard in Palestine, and well-nigh darkened\r\nhis renown, has lost fame and honour for a Jewish girl, whom he could\r\nnot even save by so costly a sacrifice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalvoisin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank thee\xe2\x80\x94thou hast touched the\r\nstring at which my heart most readily thrills!\xe2\x80\x94Come of it what may,\r\nrecreant shall never be added to the name of Bois-Guilbert. Would to\r\nGod, Richard, or any of his vaunting minions of England, would appear\r\nin these lists! But they will be empty\xe2\x80\x94no one will risk to break a\r\nlance for the innocent, the forlorn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe better for thee, if it prove so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Preceptor; \xe2\x80\x9cif no\r\nchampion appears, it is not by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall\r\ndie, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the\r\nblame, and who will count that blame for praise and commendation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert; \xe2\x80\x9cif no champion appears, I am but a part of\r\nthe pageant, sitting indeed on horseback in the lists, but having no\r\npart in what is to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin; \xe2\x80\x9cno more than the armed image of Saint\r\nGeorge when it makes part of a procession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will resume my resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the haughty Templar. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nhas despised me\xe2\x80\x94repulsed me\xe2\x80\x94reviled me\xe2\x80\x94And wherefore should I offer up\r\nfor her whatever of estimation I have in the opinion of others?\r\nMalvoisin, I will appear in the lists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the\r\nPreceptor followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in\r\nBois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x99s fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much\r\nadvantage from his being one day at the head of the Order, not to\r\nmention the preferment of which Mont-Fitchet had given him hopes, on\r\ncondition he would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate Rebecca.\r\nYet although, in combating his friend\xe2\x80\x99s better feelings, he possessed\r\nall the advantage which a wily, composed, selfish disposition has over\r\na man agitated by strong and contending passions, it required all\r\nMalvoisin\xe2\x80\x99s art to keep Bois-Guilbert steady to the purpose he had\r\nprevailed on him to adopt. He was obliged to watch him closely to\r\nprevent his resuming his purpose of flight, to intercept his\r\ncommunication with the Grand Master, lest he should come to an open\r\nrupture with his Superior, and to renew, from time to time, the various\r\narguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as\r\nchampion on this occasion, Bois-Guilbert, without either accelerating\r\nor ensuring the fate of Rebecca, would follow the only course by which\r\nhe could save himself from degradation and disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nShadows avaunt!\xe2\x80\x94Richard\xe2\x80\x99s himself again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD III\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Black Knight\xe2\x80\x94for it becomes necessary to resume the train of\r\nhis adventures\xe2\x80\x94left the Trysting-tree of the generous Outlaw, he held\r\nhis way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent and\r\nrevenue, called the Priory of Saint Botolph, to which the wounded\r\nIvanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance\r\nof the faithful Gurth, and the magnanimous Wamba. It is unnecessary at\r\npresent to mention what took place in the interim betwixt Wilfred and\r\nhis deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave\r\ncommunication, messengers were dispatched by the Prior in several\r\ndirections, and that on the succeeding morning the Black Knight was\r\nabout to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester Wamba, who\r\nattended as his guide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will meet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cat Coningsburgh, the castle of the\r\ndeceased Athelstane, since there thy father Cedric holds the funeral\r\nfeast for his noble relation. I would see your Saxon kindred together,\r\nSir Wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore.\r\nThou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to\r\nthy father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took an affectionate farewell of Ivanhoe, who expressed\r\nan anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. But the Black Knight\r\nwould not listen to the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the\r\nnext. I will have no guide with me but honest Wamba, who can play\r\npriest or fool as I shall be most in the humour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cwill attend you with all my heart. I would fain\r\nsee the feasting at the funeral of Athelstane; for, if it be not full\r\nand frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and\r\ncupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. Always, Sir Knight, I\r\nwill trust your valour with making my excuse to my master Cedric, in\r\ncase mine own wit should fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how should my poor valour succeed, Sir Jester, when thy light wit\r\nhalts?\xe2\x80\x94resolve me that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWit, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cmay do much. He is a quick,\r\napprehensive knave, who sees his neighbours blind side, and knows how\r\nto keep the lee-gage when his passions are blowing high. But valour is\r\na sturdy fellow, that makes all split. He rows against both wind and\r\ntide, and makes way notwithstanding; and, therefore, good Sir Knight,\r\nwhile I take advantage of the fair weather in our noble master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemper, I will expect you to bestir yourself when it grows rough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight of the Fetterlock, since it is your pleasure so to be\r\ndistinguished,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cI fear me you have chosen a talkative\r\nand a troublesome fool to be your guide. But he knows every path and\r\nalley in the woods as well as e\xe2\x80\x99er a hunter who frequents them; and the\r\npoor knave, as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9can he have the gift of showing my road, I\r\nshall not grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasant.\xe2\x80\x94Fare\r\nthee well, kind Wilfred\xe2\x80\x94I charge thee not to attempt to travel till\r\nto-morrow at earliest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he extended his hand to Ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips,\r\ntook leave of the Prior, mounted his horse, and departed, with Wamba\r\nfor his companion. Ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were\r\nlost in the shades of the surrounding forest, and then returned into\r\nthe convent.\r\n\r\nBut shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the Prior. The old\r\nman came in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of his\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthan my fondest hope could have anticipated;\r\neither my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led me to\r\nsuppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure upon it. I feel\r\nalready as if I could bear my corslet; and so much the better, for\r\nthoughts pass in my mind which render me unwilling to remain here\r\nlonger in inactivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the saints forbid,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the son of the Saxon\r\nCedric should leave our convent ere his wounds were healed! It were\r\nshame to our profession were we to suffer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor would I desire to leave your hospitable roof, venerable father,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cdid I not feel myself able to endure the journey, and\r\ncompelled to undertake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what can have urged you to so sudden a departure?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never, holy father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cfelt an\r\napprehension of approaching evil, for which you in vain attempted to\r\nassign a cause?\xe2\x80\x94Have you never found your mind darkened, like the sunny\r\nlandscape, by the sudden cloud, which augurs a coming tempest?\xe2\x80\x94And\r\nthinkest thou not that such impulses are deserving of attention, as\r\nbeing the hints of our guardian spirits, that danger is impending?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may not deny,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, crossing himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat such things\r\nhave been, and have been of Heaven; but then such communications have\r\nhad a visibly useful scope and tendency. But thou, wounded as thou art,\r\nwhat avails it thou shouldst follow the steps of him whom thou couldst\r\nnot aid, were he to be assaulted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrior,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cthou dost mistake\xe2\x80\x94I am stout enough to exchange\r\nbuffets with any who will challenge me to such a traffic\xe2\x80\x94But were it\r\notherwise, may I not aid him were he in danger, by other means than by\r\nforce of arms? It is but too well known that the Saxons love not the\r\nNorman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in upon\r\nthem when their hearts are irritated by the death of Athelstane, and\r\ntheir heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge\r\nthemselves? I hold his entrance among them at such a moment most\r\nperilous, and I am resolved to share or avert the danger; which, that I\r\nmay the better do, I would crave of thee the use of some palfrey whose\r\npace may be softer than that of my \xe2\x80\x98destrier\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d 56\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the worthy churchman; \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall have mine own ambling\r\njennet, and I would it ambled as easy for your sake as that of the\r\nAbbot of Saint Albans. Yet this will I say for Malkin, for so I call\r\nher, that unless you were to borrow a ride on the juggler\xe2\x80\x99s steed that\r\npaces a hornpipe amongst the eggs, you could not go a journey on a\r\ncreature so gentle and smooth-paced. I have composed many a homily on\r\nher back, to the edification of my brethren of the convent, and many\r\npoor Christian souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pray you, reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9clet Malkin be got ready\r\ninstantly, and bid Gurth attend me with mine arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but fair sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Prior, \xe2\x80\x9cI pray you to remember that\r\nMalkin hath as little skill in arms as her master, and that I warrant\r\nnot her enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. O, Malkin, I\r\npromise you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend against any undue\r\nweight\xe2\x80\x94I did but borrow the \xe2\x80\x98Fructus Temporum\xe2\x80\x99 from the priest of Saint\r\nBees, and I promise you she would not stir from the gate until I had\r\nexchanged the huge volume for my little breviary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, holy father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cI will not distress her with\r\ntoo much weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds but she\r\nhas the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reply was made while Gurth was buckling on the Knight\xe2\x80\x99s heels a\r\npair of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restive horse\r\nthat his best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.\r\n\r\nThe deep and sharp rowels with which Ivanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s heels were now armed,\r\nbegan to make the worthy Prior repent of his courtesy, and\r\nejaculate,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but fair sir, now I bethink me, my Malkin abideth not\r\nthe spur\xe2\x80\x94Better it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple\r\ndown at the Grange, which may be had in little more than an hour, and\r\ncannot but be tractable, in respect that she draweth much of our winter\r\nfire-wood, and eateth no corn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your first offer, as I\r\nsee Malkin is already led forth to the gate. Gurth shall carry mine\r\narmour; and for the rest, rely on it, that as I will not overload\r\nMalkin\xe2\x80\x99s back, she shall not overcome my patience. And now, farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his wound\r\npromised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager to escape the\r\nimportunity of the Prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his age\r\nand fatness would permit, now singing the praises of Malkin, now\r\nrecommending caution to the Knight in managing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the old man, laughing at his own jest, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing barely in her\r\nfifteenth year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIvanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a\r\npalfrey\xe2\x80\x99s paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the Prior\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave advices and facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and\r\ncommanded his squire (for such Gurth now called himself) to keep close\r\nby his side, he followed the track of the Black Knight into the forest,\r\nwhile the Prior stood at the gate of the convent looking after him, and\r\nejaculating,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSaint Mary! how prompt and fiery be these men of war! I\r\nwould I had not trusted Malkin to his keeping, for, crippled as I am\r\nwith the cold rheum, I am undone if aught but good befalls her. And\r\nyet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, recollecting himself, \xe2\x80\x9cas I would not spare my own old\r\nand disabled limbs in the good cause of Old England, so Malkin must\r\ne\xe2\x80\x99en run her hazard on the same venture; and it may be they will think\r\nour poor house worthy of some munificent guerdon\xe2\x80\x94or, it may be, they\r\nwill send the old Prior a pacing nag. And if they do none of these, as\r\ngreat men will forget little men\xe2\x80\x99s service, truly I shall hold me well\r\nrepaid in having done that which is right. And it is now well-nigh the\r\nfitting time to summon the brethren to breakfast in the refectory\xe2\x80\x94Ah! I\r\ndoubt they obey that call more cheerily than the bells for primes and\r\nmatins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Prior of Saint Botolph\xe2\x80\x99s hobbled back again into the refectory,\r\nto preside over the stockfish and ale, which was just serving out for\r\nthe friars\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast. Busy and important, he sat him down at the\r\ntable, and many a dark word he threw out, of benefits to be expected to\r\nthe convent, and high deeds of service done by himself, which, at\r\nanother season, would have attracted observation. But as the stockfish\r\nwas highly salted, and the ale reasonably powerful, the jaws of the\r\nbrethren were too anxiously employed to admit of their making much use\r\nof their ears; nor do we read of any of the fraternity, who was tempted\r\nto speculate upon the mysterious hints of their Superior, except Father\r\nDiggory, who was severely afflicted by the toothache, so that he could\r\nonly eat on one side of his jaws.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Black Champion and his guide were pacing at their\r\nleisure through the recesses of the forest; the good Knight whiles\r\nhumming to himself the lay of some enamoured troubadour, sometimes\r\nencouraging by questions the prating disposition of his attendant, so\r\nthat their dialogue formed a whimsical mixture of song and jest, of\r\nwhich we would fain give our readers some idea. You are then to imagine\r\nthis Knight, such as we have already described him, strong of person,\r\ntall, broad-shouldered, and large of bone, mounted on his mighty black\r\ncharger, which seemed made on purpose to bear his weight, so easily he\r\npaced forward under it, having the visor of his helmet raised, in order\r\nto admit freedom of breath, yet keeping the beaver, or under part,\r\nclosed, so that his features could be but imperfectly distinguished.\r\nBut his ruddy embrowned cheek-bones could be plainly seen, and the\r\nlarge and bright blue eyes, that flashed from under the dark shade of\r\nthe raised visor; and the whole gesture and look of the champion\r\nexpressed careless gaiety and fearless confidence\xe2\x80\x94a mind which was\r\nunapt to apprehend danger, and prompt to defy it when most imminent\xe2\x80\x94yet\r\nwith whom danger was a familiar thought, as with one whose trade was\r\nwar and adventure.\r\n\r\nThe Jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led\r\nhim to adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his wooden sword, with\r\na targe to match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding his\r\nprofession, shown himself a skilful master during the storming of\r\nTorquilstone. Indeed, the infirmity of Wamba\xe2\x80\x99s brain consisted chiefly\r\nin a kind of impatient irritability, which suffered him not long to\r\nremain quiet in any posture, or adhere to any certain train of ideas,\r\nalthough he was for a few minutes alert enough in performing any\r\nimmediate task, or in apprehending any immediate topic. On horseback,\r\ntherefore, he was perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards,\r\nnow on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal,\xe2\x80\x94now\r\nhanging both his legs on one side, and now sitting with his face to the\r\ntail, moping, mowing, and making a thousand apish gestures, until his\r\npalfrey took his freaks so much to heart, as fairly to lay him at his\r\nlength on the green grass\xe2\x80\x94an incident which greatly amused the Knight,\r\nbut compelled his companion to ride more steadily thereafter.\r\n\r\nAt the point of their journey at which we take them up, this joyous\r\npair were engaged in singing a virelai, as it was called, in which the\r\nclown bore a mellow burden, to the better instructed Knight of the\r\nFetterlock. And thus run the ditty:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnna-Marie, love, up is the sun,\r\nAnna-Marie, love, morn is begun,\r\nMists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,\r\nUp in the morning, love, Anna-Marie.\r\nAnna-Marie, love, up in the morn,\r\nThe hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,\r\nThe echo rings merry from rock and from tree,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis time to arouse thee, love, Anna-Marie.\r\n\r\n\r\nWamba.\r\n\r\nO Tybalt, love, Tybalt, awake me not yet,\r\nAround my soft pillow while softer dreams flit,\r\nFor what are the joys that in waking we prove,\r\nCompared with these visions, O, Tybalt, my love?\r\nLet the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,\r\nLet the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,\r\nSofter sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber I prove,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nBut think not I dreamt of thee, Tybalt, my love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dainty song,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, when they had finished their carol, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nswear by my bauble, a pretty moral!\xe2\x80\x94I used to sing it with Gurth, once\r\nmy playfellow, and now, by the grace of God and his master, no less\r\nthan a freemen; and we once came by the cudgel for being so entranced\r\nby the melody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the\r\nditty betwixt sleeping and waking\xe2\x80\x94my bones ache at thinking of the tune\r\never since. Nevertheless, I have played the part of Anna-Marie, to\r\nplease you, fair sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to\r\nwhich the Knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.\r\n\r\nKnight and Wamba.\r\n\r\nThere came three merry men from south, west, and north,\r\n    Ever more sing the roundelay;\r\nTo win the Widow of Wycombe forth,\r\n    And where was the widow might say them nay?\r\n\r\nThe first was a knight, and from Tynedale he came,\r\n    Ever more sing the roundelay;\r\nAnd his fathers, God save us, were men of great fame,\r\n    And where was the widow might say him nay?\r\n\r\nOf his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,\r\n    He boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;\r\nShe bade him go bask by his sea-coal fire,\r\n    For she was the widow would say him nay.\r\n\r\n\r\nWamba.\r\n\r\nThe next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,\r\n    Merrily sing the roundelay;\r\nHur\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman, God wot, and hur\xe2\x80\x99s lineage was of Wales,\r\n    And where was the widow might say him nay?\r\n\r\nSir David ap Morgan ap Griffith ap Hugh\r\n    Ap Tudor ap Rhice, quoth his roundelay\r\nShe said that one widow for so many was too few,\r\n    And she bade the Welshman wend his way.\r\n\r\nBut then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of Kent,\r\n    Jollily singing his roundelay;\r\nHe spoke to the widow of living and rent,\r\n    And where was the widow could say him nay?\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth.\r\n\r\nSo the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,\r\n    There for to sing their roundelay;\r\nFor a yeoman of Kent, with his yearly rent,\r\n    There never was a widow could say him nay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d said the knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our host of the Trysting-tree,\r\nor the jolly Friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise of our\r\nbluff yeoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would not I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut for the horn that hangs at your\r\nbaldric.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthis is a pledge of Locksley\xe2\x80\x99s goodwill, though\r\nI am not like to need it. Three mots on this bugle will, I am assured,\r\nbring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would say, Heaven forefend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, \xe2\x80\x9cwere it not that that\r\nfair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what meanest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cthinkest thou that but for\r\nthis pledge of fellowship they would assault us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, for me I say nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cfor green trees have ears as\r\nwell as stone walls. But canst thou construe me this, Sir Knight\xe2\x80\x94When\r\nis thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than full?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, never, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an\r\nanswer! Thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a Saxon,\r\nand leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hold our friends for robbers, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight of the\r\nFetterlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hear me not say so, fair sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cit may relieve a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteed to take of his mail when he hath a long journey to make; and,\r\ncertes, it may do good to the rider\xe2\x80\x99s soul to ease him of that which is\r\nthe root of evil; therefore will I give no hard names to those who do\r\nsuch services. Only I would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my\r\nchamber, when I meet with these good fellows, because it might save\r\nthem some trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWE are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair\r\ncharacter thou dost afford them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray for them with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the town, not in\r\nthe greenwood, like the Abbot of Saint Bees, whom they caused to say\r\nmass with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay as thou list, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthese yeomen did thy\r\nmaster Cedric yeomanly service at Torquilstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, truly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that was in the fashion of their\r\ntrade with Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir trade, Wamba! how mean you by that?\xe2\x80\x9d replied his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, thus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester. \xe2\x80\x9cThey make up a balanced account with\r\nHeaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fair as\r\nIsaac the Jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very\r\nlittle, and take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, on\r\ntheir own behalf the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath\r\npromised to charitable loans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me an example of your meaning, Wamba,\xe2\x80\x94I know nothing of ciphers\r\nor rates of usage,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9can your valour be so dull, you will please to learn\r\nthat those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not quite so\r\nlaudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants\r\ntaken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the\r\nrelief of a poor widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of these was the good deed, which was the felony?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\r\nthe Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good gibe! a good gibe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping witty company\r\nsharpeneth the apprehension. You said nothing so well, Sir Knight, I\r\nwill be sworn, when you held drunken vespers with the bluff Hermit.\xe2\x80\x94But\r\nto go on. The merry-men of the forest set off the building of a cottage\r\nwith the burning of a castle,\xe2\x80\x94the thatching of a choir against the\r\nrobbing of a church,\xe2\x80\x94the setting free a poor prisoner against the\r\nmurder of a proud sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the\r\ndeliverance of a Saxon franklin against the burning alive of a Norman\r\nbaron. Gentle thieves they are, in short, and courteous robbers; but it\r\nis ever the luckiest to meet with them when they are at the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, Wamba?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters\r\nwith Heaven. But when they have struck an even balance, Heaven help\r\nthem with whom they next open the account! The travellers who first met\r\nthem after their good service at Torquilstone would have a woeful\r\nflaying.\xe2\x80\x94And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, coming close up to the Knight\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere be companions who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet\r\nthan yonder outlaws.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, I trow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, sir, but we have Malvoisin\xe2\x80\x99s men-at-arms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cand let\r\nme tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of these is worth\r\na band of wolves at any time. They are now expecting their harvest, and\r\nare reinforced with the soldiers that escaped from Torquilstone. So\r\nthat, should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our\r\nfeats of arms.\xe2\x80\x94Now, I pray you, Sir Knight, what would you do if we met\r\ntwo of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPin the villains to the earth with my lance, Wamba, if they offered us\r\nany impediment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if there were four of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey should drink of the same cup,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if six,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cand we as we now are, barely two\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nyou not remember Locksley\xe2\x80\x99s horn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! sound for aid,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cagainst a score of such\r\n\xe2\x80\x98rascaille\xe2\x80\x99 as these, whom one good knight could drive before him, as\r\nthe wind drives the withered leaves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cI will pray you for a close sight of that\r\nsame horn that hath so powerful a breath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his\r\nfellow-traveller, who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTra-lira-la,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, whistling the notes; \xe2\x80\x9cnay, I know my gamut as\r\nwell as another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow mean you, knave?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight; \xe2\x80\x9crestore me the bugle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cContent you, Sir Knight, it is in safe keeping. When Valour and Folly\r\ntravel, Folly should bear the horn, because she can blow the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay but, rogue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cthis exceedeth thy\r\nlicense\xe2\x80\x94Beware ye tamper not with my patience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUrge me not with violence, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jester, keeping at a\r\ndistance from the impatient champion, \xe2\x80\x9cor Folly will show a clean pair\r\nof heels, and leave Valour to find out his way through the wood as best\r\nhe may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, thou hast hit me there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cand, sooth to say, I\r\nhave little time to jangle with thee. Keep the horn an thou wilt, but\r\nlet us proceed on our journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not harm me, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee no, thou knave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but pledge me your knightly word for it,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Wamba, as he\r\napproached with great caution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy knightly word I pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, then, Valour and Folly are once more boon companions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJester, coming up frankly to the Knight\xe2\x80\x99s side; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, in truth, I love\r\nnot such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly Friar, when his\r\nholiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. And now that\r\nFolly wears the horn, let Valour rouse himself, and shake his mane;\r\nfor, if I mistake not, there are company in yonder brake that are on\r\nthe look-out for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes thee judge so?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have twice or thrice noticed the glance of a motion from\r\namongst the green leaves. Had they been honest men, they had kept the\r\npath. But yonder thicket is a choice chapel for the Clerks of Saint\r\nNicholas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my faith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, closing his visor, \xe2\x80\x9cI think thou be\xe2\x80\x99st\r\nin the right on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in good time did he close it, for three arrows, flew at the same\r\ninstant from the suspected spot against his head and breast, one of\r\nwhich would have penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside\r\nby the steel visor. The other two were averted by the gorget, and by\r\nthe shield which hung around his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, trusty armourers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWamba, let us close with\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he rode straight to the thicket. He was met by six or seven\r\nmen-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full career.\r\nThree of the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as little\r\neffect as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. The Black\r\nKnight\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his\r\nvisor. He raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible\r\ndignity, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat means this, my masters!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The men made no\r\nother reply than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every\r\nside, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cDie, tyrant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! Saint Edward! Ha! Saint George!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, striking\r\ndown a man at every invocation; \xe2\x80\x9chave we traitors here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis opponents, desperate as they were, bore back from an arm which\r\ncarried death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his\r\nsingle strength was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a\r\nknight, in blue armour, who had hitherto kept himself behind the other\r\nassailants, spurred forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the\r\nrider but at the steed, wounded the noble animal mortally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a felon stroke!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Black Knight, as the steed\r\nfell to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment, Wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so\r\nspeedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. The sudden sound made\r\nthe murderers bear back once more, and Wamba, though so imperfectly\r\nweaponed, did not hesitate to rush in and assist the Black Knight to\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShame on ye, false cowards!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he in the blue harness, who\r\nseemed to lead the assailants, \xe2\x80\x9cdo ye fly from the empty blast of a\r\nhorn blown by a Jester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnimated by his words, they attacked the Black Knight anew, whose best\r\nrefuge was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself\r\nwith his sword. The felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching\r\nthe moment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed,\r\ngalloped against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the\r\ntree, when his purpose was again intercepted by Wamba. The Jester,\r\nmaking up by agility the want of strength, and little noticed by the\r\nmen-at-arms, who were busied in their more important object, hovered on\r\nthe skirts of the fight, and effectually checked the fatal career of\r\nthe Blue Knight, by hamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword.\r\nHorse and man went to the ground; yet the situation of the Knight of\r\nthe Fetterlock continued very precarious, as he was pressed close by\r\nseveral men completely armed, and began to be fatigued by the violent\r\nexertions necessary to defend himself on so many points at nearly the\r\nsame moment, when a grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth\r\none of the most formidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen\r\nbroke forth from the glade, headed by Locksley and the jovial Friar,\r\nwho, taking ready and effectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the\r\nruffians, all of whom lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. The\r\nBlack Knight thanked his deliverers with a dignity they had not\r\nobserved in his former bearing, which hitherto had seemed rather that\r\nof a blunt bold soldier, than of a person of exalted rank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt concerns me much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ceven before I express my full\r\ngratitude to my ready friends, to discover, if I may, who have been my\r\nunprovoked enemies.\xe2\x80\x94Open the visor of that Blue Knight, Wamba, who\r\nseems the chief of these villains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who,\r\nbruised by his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, lay\r\nincapable either of flight or resistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, valiant sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be your armourer as well as\r\nyour equerry\xe2\x80\x94I have dismounted you, and now I will unhelm you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the Blue\r\nKnight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the\r\nKnight of the Fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not\r\nexpect to have seen under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaldemar Fitzurse!\xe2\x80\x9d he said in astonishment; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat could urge one of\r\nthy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captive Knight, looking up to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthou knowest\r\nlittle of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can\r\nlead every child of Adam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRevenge?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Black Knight; \xe2\x80\x9cI never wronged thee\xe2\x80\x94On me thou\r\nhast nought to revenge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, Richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn\xe2\x80\x94was that no\r\ninjury to a Norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Black Knight; \xe2\x80\x9ca proper cause of enmity,\r\nand followed up to a bloody issue!\xe2\x80\x94Stand back, my masters, I would\r\nspeak to him alone.\xe2\x80\x94And now, Waldemar Fitzurse, say me the\r\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94confess who set thee on this traitorous deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy father\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Waldemar, \xe2\x80\x9cwho, in so doing, did but\r\navenge on thee thy disobedience to thy father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichard\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature\r\novercame it. He pressed his hand against his brow, and remained an\r\ninstant gazing on the face of the humbled baron, in whose features\r\npride was contending with shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou dost not ask thy life, Waldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe that is in the lion\xe2\x80\x99s clutch,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Fitzurse, \xe2\x80\x9cknows it were\r\nneedless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it, then, unasked,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard; \xe2\x80\x9cthe lion preys not on\r\nprostrate carcasses.\xe2\x80\x94Take thy life, but with this condition, that in\r\nthree days thou shalt leave England, and go to hide thine infamy in thy\r\nNorman castle, and that thou wilt never mention the name of John of\r\nAnjou as connected with thy felony. If thou art found on English ground\r\nafter the space I have allotted thee, thou diest\xe2\x80\x94or if thou breathest\r\naught that can attaint the honour of my house, by Saint George! not the\r\naltar itself shall be a sanctuary. I will hang thee out to feed the\r\nravens, from the very pinnacle of thine own castle.\xe2\x80\x94Let this knight\r\nhave a steed, Locksley, for I see your yeomen have caught those which\r\nwere running loose, and let him depart unharmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that I judge I listen to a voice whose behests must not be\r\ndisputed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cI would send a shaft after the\r\nskulking villain that should spare him the labour of a long journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou bearest an English heart, Locksley,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwell dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest\xe2\x80\x94I am Richard\r\nof England!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high\r\nrank, and no less distinguished character of C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion, the yeomen\r\nat once kneeled down before him, and at the same time tendered their\r\nallegiance, and implored pardon for their offences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, in a gracious tone, looking on them\r\nwith a countenance in which his habitual good-humour had already\r\nconquered the blaze of hasty resentment, and whose features retained no\r\nmark of the late desperate conflict, excepting the flush arising from\r\nexertion,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cArise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy friends!\xe2\x80\x94Your misdemeanours, whether in\r\nforest or field, have been atoned by the loyal services you rendered my\r\ndistressed subjects before the walls of Torquilstone, and the rescue\r\nyou have this day afforded to your sovereign. Arise, my liegemen, and\r\nbe good subjects in future.\xe2\x80\x94And thou, brave Locksley\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall me no longer Locksley, my Liege, but know me under the name,\r\nwhich, I fear, fame hath blown too widely not to have reached even your\r\nroyal ears\xe2\x80\x94I am Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest.\xe2\x80\x9d 561\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKing of Outlaws, and Prince of good fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cwho hath\r\nnot heard a name that has been borne as far as Palestine? But be\r\nassured, brave Outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the\r\nturbulent times to which it hath given rise, shall be remembered to thy\r\ndisadvantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue says the proverb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba, interposing his word, but with\r\nsome abatement of his usual petulance,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98When the cat is away,\r\nThe mice will play.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Wamba, art thou there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been so long of\r\nhearing thy voice, I thought thou hadst taken flight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take flight!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wamba; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen do you ever find Folly separated\r\nfrom Valour? There lies the trophy of my sword, that good grey gelding,\r\nwhom I heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay\r\nthere houghed in his place. It is true, I gave a little ground at\r\nfirst, for a motley jacket does not brook lance-heads, as a steel\r\ndoublet will. But if I fought not at sword\xe2\x80\x99s point, you will grant me\r\nthat I sounded the onset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to good purpose, honest Wamba,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the King. \xe2\x80\x9cThy good\r\nservice shall not be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Confiteor! Confiteor!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94exclaimed, in a submissive tone, a voice near\r\nthe King\xe2\x80\x99s side\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmy Latin will carry me no farther\xe2\x80\x94but I confess my\r\ndeadly treason, and pray leave to have absolution before I am led to\r\nexecution!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRichard looked around, and beheld the jovial Friar on his knees,\r\ntelling his rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle\r\nduring the skirmish, lay on the grass beside him. His countenance was\r\ngathered so as he thought might best express the most profound\r\ncontrition, his eyes being turned up, and the corners of his mouth\r\ndrawn down, as Wamba expressed it, like the tassels at the mouth of a\r\npurse. Yet this demure affectation of extreme penitence was whimsically\r\nbelied by a ludicrous meaning which lurked in his huge features, and\r\nseemed to pronounce his fear and repentance alike hypocritical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what art thou cast down, mad Priest?\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard; \xe2\x80\x9cart thou\r\nafraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve Our Lady and\r\nSaint Dunstan?\xe2\x80\x94Tush, man! fear it not; Richard of England betrays no\r\nsecrets that pass over the flagon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, most gracious sovereign,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Hermit, (well known to the\r\ncurious in penny-histories of Robin Hood, by the name of Friar Tuck,)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is not the crosier I fear, but the sceptre.\xe2\x80\x94Alas! that my\r\nsacrilegious fist should ever have been applied to the ear of the\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s anointed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, \xe2\x80\x9csits the wind there?\xe2\x80\x94In truth I had forgotten\r\nthe buffet, though mine ear sung after it for a whole day. But if the\r\ncuff was fairly given, I will be judged by the good men around, if it\r\nwas not as well repaid\xe2\x80\x94or, if thou thinkest I still owe thee aught, and\r\nwill stand forth for another counterbuff\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Friar Tuck, \xe2\x80\x9cI had mine own returned, and with\r\nusury\xe2\x80\x94may your Majesty ever pay your debts as fully!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could do so with cuffs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cmy creditors should have\r\nlittle reason to complain of an empty exchequer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, resuming his demure hypocritical\r\ncountenance, \xe2\x80\x9cI know not what penance I ought to perform for that most\r\nsacrilegious blow!\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak no more of it, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King; \xe2\x80\x9cafter having stood so\r\nmany cuffs from Paynims and misbelievers, I were void of reason to\r\nquarrel with the buffet of a clerk so holy as he of Copmanhurst. Yet,\r\nmine honest Friar, I think it would be best both for the church and\r\nthyself, that I should procure a license to unfrock thee, and retain\r\nthee as a yeoman of our guard, serving in care of our person, as\r\nformerly in attendance upon the altar of Saint Dunstan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Liege,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9cI humbly crave your pardon; and you would\r\nreadily grant my excuse, did you but know how the sin of laziness has\r\nbeset me. Saint Dunstan\xe2\x80\x94may he be gracious to us!\xe2\x80\x94stands quiet in his\r\nniche, though I should forget my orisons in killing a fat buck\xe2\x80\x94I stay\r\nout of my cell sometimes a night, doing I wot not what\xe2\x80\x94Saint Dunstan\r\nnever complains\xe2\x80\x94a quiet master he is, and a peaceful, as ever was made\r\nof wood.\xe2\x80\x94But to be a yeoman in attendance on my sovereign the King\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nhonour is great, doubtless\xe2\x80\x94yet, if I were but to step aside to comfort\r\na widow in one corner, or to kill a deer in another, it would be,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98where is the dog Priest?\xe2\x80\x99 says one. \xe2\x80\x98Who has seen the accursed Tuck?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays another. \xe2\x80\x98The unfrocked villain destroys more venison than half\r\nthe country besides,\xe2\x80\x99 says one keeper; \xe2\x80\x98And is hunting after every shy\r\ndoe in the country!\xe2\x80\x99 quoth a second.\xe2\x80\x94In fine, good my Liege, I pray you\r\nto leave me as you found me; or, if in aught you desire to extend your\r\nbenevolence to me, that I may be considered as the poor Clerk of Saint\r\nDunstan\xe2\x80\x99s cell in Copmanhurst, to whom any small donation will be most\r\nthankfully acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cand the Holy Clerk shall have a\r\ngrant of vert and venison in my woods of Warncliffe. Mark, however, I\r\nwill but assign thee three bucks every season; but if that do not prove\r\nan apology for thy slaying thirty, I am no Christian knight nor true\r\nking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grace may be well assured,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, with the grace\r\nof Saint Dunstan, I shall find the way of multiplying your most\r\nbounteous gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI nothing doubt it, good brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King; \xe2\x80\x9cand as venison is\r\nbut dry food, our cellarer shall have orders to deliver to thee a butt\r\nof sack, a runlet of Malvoisie, and three hogsheads of ale of the first\r\nstrike, yearly\xe2\x80\x94If that will not quench thy thirst, thou must come to\r\ncourt, and become acquainted with my butler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for Saint Dunstan?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA cope, a stole, and an altar-cloth shalt thou also have,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nthe King, crossing himself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut we may not turn our game into earnest,\r\nlest God punish us for thinking more on our follies than on his honour\r\nand worship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer for my patron,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Priest, joyously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnswer for thyself, Friar,\xe2\x80\x9d said King Richard, something sternly; but\r\nimmediately stretching out his hand to the Hermit, the latter, somewhat\r\nabashed, bent his knee, and saluted it. \xe2\x80\x9cThou dost less honour to my\r\nextended palm than to my clenched fist,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Monarch; \xe2\x80\x9cthou didst\r\nonly kneel to the one, and to the other didst prostrate thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the Friar, afraid perhaps of again giving offence by continuing the\r\nconversation in too jocose a style\xe2\x80\x94a false step to be particularly\r\nguarded against by those who converse with monarchs\xe2\x80\x94bowed profoundly,\r\nand fell into the rear.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nAll hail to the lordlings of high degree,\r\nWho live not more happy, though greater than we!\r\n    Our pastimes to see,\r\n    Under every green tree,\r\nIn all the gay woodland, right welcome ye be.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACDONALD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new comers were Wilfred of Ivanhoe, on the Prior of Botolph\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalfrey, and Gurth, who attended him, on the Knight\xe2\x80\x99s own war-horse.\r\nThe astonishment of Ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master\r\nbesprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in\r\nthe little glade in which the battle had taken place. Nor was he less\r\nsurprised to see Richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the\r\noutlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue\r\ntherefore for a prince. He hesitated whether to address the King as the\r\nBlack Knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards\r\nhim. Richard saw his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFear not, Wilfred,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto address Richard Plantagenet as\r\nhimself, since thou seest him in the company of true English hearts,\r\nalthough it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm\r\nEnglish blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Wilfred of Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gallant Outlaw, stepping forward,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me\r\nsay somewhat proudly, that of men who have suffered much, he hath not\r\ntruer subjects than those who now stand around him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot doubt it, brave man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred, \xe2\x80\x9csince thou art of the\r\nnumber\xe2\x80\x94But what mean these marks of death and danger? these slain men,\r\nand the bloody armour of my Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTreason hath been with us, Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, thanks to\r\nthese brave men, treason hath met its meed\xe2\x80\x94But, now I bethink me, thou\r\ntoo art a traitor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9ca most disobedient traitor;\r\nfor were not our orders positive, that thou shouldst repose thyself at\r\nSaint Botolph\xe2\x80\x99s until thy wound was healed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is healed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cit is not of more consequence than the\r\nscratch of a bodkin. But why, oh why, noble Prince, will you thus vex\r\nthe hearts of your faithful servants, and expose your life by lonely\r\njourneys and rash adventures, as if it were of no more value than that\r\nof a mere knight-errant, who has no interest on earth but what lance\r\nand sword may procure him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Richard Plantagenet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cdesires no more fame than\r\nhis good lance and sword may acquire him\xe2\x80\x94and Richard Plantagenet is\r\nprouder of achieving an adventure, with only his good sword, and his\r\ngood arm to speed, than if he led to battle a host of an hundred\r\nthousand armed men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your kingdom, my Liege,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cyour kingdom is threatened\r\nwith dissolution and civil war\xe2\x80\x94your subjects menaced with every species\r\nof evil, if deprived of their sovereign in some of those dangers which\r\nit is your daily pleasure to incur, and from which you have but this\r\nmoment narrowly escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! ho! my kingdom and my subjects?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Richard, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntell thee, Sir Wilfred, the best of them are most willing to repay my\r\nfollies in kind\xe2\x80\x94For example, my very faithful servant, Wilfred of\r\nIvanhoe, will not obey my positive commands, and yet reads his king a\r\nhomily, because he does not walk exactly by his advice. Which of us has\r\nmost reason to upbraid the other?\xe2\x80\x94Yet forgive me, my faithful Wilfred.\r\nThe time I have spent, and am yet to spend in concealment, is, as I\r\nexplained to thee at Saint Botolph\xe2\x80\x99s, necessary to give my friends and\r\nfaithful nobles time to assemble their forces, that when Richard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn is announced, he should be at the head of such a force as\r\nenemies shall tremble to face, and thus subdue the meditated treason,\r\nwithout even unsheathing a sword. Estoteville and Bohun will not be\r\nstrong enough to move forward to York for twenty-four hours. I must\r\nhave news of Salisbury from the south; and of Beauchamp, in\r\nWarwickshire; and of Multon and Percy in the north. The Chancellor must\r\nmake sure of London. Too sudden an appearance would subject me to\r\ndangers, other than my lance and sword, though backed by the bow of\r\nbold Robin, or the quarter-staff of Friar Tuck, and the horn of the\r\nsage Wamba, may be able to rescue me from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend\r\nwith the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master\r\nupon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it\r\nwas unpardonable in him to have sought out. The young knight sighed,\r\ntherefore, and held his peace; while Richard, rejoiced at having\r\nsilenced his counsellor, though his heart acknowledged the justice of\r\nthe charge he had brought against him, went on in conversation with\r\nRobin Hood.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cKing of Outlaws,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chave you no refreshment to\r\noffer to your brother sovereign? for these dead knaves have found me\r\nboth in exercise and appetite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn troth,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Outlaw, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I scorn to lie to your Grace, our\r\nlarder is chiefly supplied with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and was somewhat\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith venison, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, gaily; \xe2\x80\x9cbetter food at need\r\nthere can be none\xe2\x80\x94and truly, if a king will not remain at home and slay\r\nhis own game, methinks he should not brawl too loud if he finds it\r\nkilled to his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf your Grace, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin, \xe2\x80\x9cwill again honour with your\r\npresence one of Robin Hood\xe2\x80\x99s places of rendezvous, the venison shall\r\nnot be lacking; and a stoup of ale, and it may be a cup of reasonably\r\ngood wine, to relish it withal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Outlaw accordingly led the way, followed by the buxom Monarch, more\r\nhappy, probably, in this chance meeting with Robin Hood and his\r\nforesters, than he would have been in again assuming his royal state,\r\nand presiding over a splendid circle of peers and nobles. Novelty in\r\nsociety and adventure were the zest of life to Richard C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion,\r\nand it had its highest relish when enhanced by dangers encountered and\r\nsurmounted. In the lion-hearted King, the brilliant, but useless\r\ncharacter, of a knight of romance, was in a great measure realized and\r\nrevived; and the personal glory which he acquired by his own deeds of\r\narms, was far more dear to his excited imagination, than that which a\r\ncourse of policy and wisdom would have spread around his government.\r\nAccordingly, his reign was like the course of a brilliant and rapid\r\nmeteor, which shoots along the face of Heaven, shedding around an\r\nunnecessary and portentous light, which is instantly swallowed up by\r\nuniversal darkness; his feats of chivalry furnishing themes for bards\r\nand minstrels, but affording none of those solid benefits to his\r\ncountry on which history loves to pause, and hold up as an example to\r\nposterity. But in his present company Richard showed to the greatest\r\nimaginable advantage. He was gay, good-humoured, and fond of manhood in\r\nevery rank of life.\r\n\r\nBeneath a huge oak-tree the silvan repast was hastily prepared for the\r\nKing of England, surrounded by men outlaws to his government, but who\r\nnow formed his court and his guard. As the flagon went round, the rough\r\nforesters soon lost their awe for the presence of Majesty. The song and\r\nthe jest were exchanged\xe2\x80\x94the stories of former deeds were told with\r\nadvantage; and at length, and while boasting of their successful\r\ninfraction of the laws, no one recollected they were speaking in\r\npresence of their natural guardian. The merry King, nothing heeding his\r\ndignity any more than his company, laughed, quaffed, and jested among\r\nthe jolly band. The natural and rough sense of Robin Hood led him to be\r\ndesirous that the scene should be closed ere any thing should occur to\r\ndisturb its harmony, the more especially that he observed Ivanhoe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrow clouded with anxiety. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are honoured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Ivanhoe,\r\napart, \xe2\x80\x9cby the presence of our gallant Sovereign; yet I would not that\r\nhe dallied with time, which the circumstances of his kingdom may render\r\nprecious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well and wisely spoken, brave Robin Hood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilfred, apart;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand know, moreover, that they who jest with Majesty even in its gayest\r\nmood are but toying with the lion\xe2\x80\x99s whelp, which, on slight\r\nprovocation, uses both fangs and claws.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have touched the very cause of my fear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Outlaw; \xe2\x80\x9cmy men\r\nare rough by practice and nature, the King is hasty as well as\r\ngood-humoured; nor know I how soon cause of offence may arise, or how\r\nwarmly it may be received\xe2\x80\x94it is time this revel were broken off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be by your management then, gallant yeoman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor each hint I have essayed to give him serves only to induce him to\r\nprolong it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I so soon risk the pardon and favour of my Sovereign?\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin\r\nHood, pausing for all instant; \xe2\x80\x9cbut by Saint Christopher, it shall be\r\nso. I were undeserving his grace did I not peril it for his good.\xe2\x80\x94Here,\r\nScathlock, get thee behind yonder thicket, and wind me a Norman blast\r\non thy bugle, and without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s delay on peril of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the\r\nrevellers were startled by the sound of his horn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the bugle of Malvoisin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Miller, starting to his feet,\r\nand seizing his bow. The Friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his\r\nquarter-staff. Wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook\r\nhimself to sword and target. All the others stood to their weapons.\r\n\r\nMen of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet\r\nto the battle; and, to Richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of\r\npleasure. He called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his\r\narmour, which he had laid aside; and while Gurth was putting them on,\r\nhe laid his strict injunctions on Wilfred, under pain of his highest\r\ndispleasure, not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast fought for me an hundred times, Wilfred,\xe2\x80\x94and I have seen it.\r\nThou shalt this day look on, and see how Richard will fight for his\r\nfriend and liegeman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Robin Hood had sent off several of his followers in\r\ndifferent directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw\r\nthe company effectually broken up, he approached Richard, who was now\r\ncompletely armed, and, kneeling down on one knee, craved pardon of his\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what, good yeoman?\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, somewhat impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cHave we\r\nnot already granted thee a full pardon for all transgressions? Thinkest\r\nthou our word is a feather, to be blown backward and forward between\r\nus? Thou canst not have had time to commit any new offence since that\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but I have though,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the yeoman, \xe2\x80\x9cif it be an offence to\r\ndeceive my prince for his own advantage. The bugle you have heard was\r\nnone of Malvoisin\xe2\x80\x99s, but blown by my direction, to break off the\r\nbanquet, lest it trenched upon hours of dearer import than to be thus\r\ndallied with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then rose from his knee, folded his arm on his bosom, and in a\r\nmanner rather respectful than submissive, awaited the answer of the\r\nKing,\xe2\x80\x94like one who is conscious he may have given offence, yet is\r\nconfident in the rectitude of his motive. The blood rushed in anger to\r\nthe countenance of Richard; but it was the first transient emotion, and\r\nhis sense of justice instantly subdued it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King of Sherwood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgrudges his venison and his\r\nwine-flask to the King of England? It is well, bold Robin!\xe2\x80\x94but when you\r\ncome to see me in merry London, I trust to be a less niggard host. Thou\r\nart right, however, good fellow. Let us therefore to horse and\r\naway\xe2\x80\x94Wilfred has been impatient this hour. Tell me, bold Robin, hast\r\nthou never a friend in thy band, who, not content with advising, will\r\nneeds direct thy motions, and look miserable when thou dost presume to\r\nact for thyself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin, \xe2\x80\x9cis my Lieutenant, Little John, who is even\r\nnow absent on an expedition as far as the borders of Scotland; and I\r\nwill own to your Majesty, that I am sometimes displeased by the freedom\r\nof his councils\xe2\x80\x94but, when I think twice, I cannot be long angry with\r\none who can have no motive for his anxiety save zeal for his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art right, good yeoman,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Richard; \xe2\x80\x9cand if I had Ivanhoe,\r\non the one hand, to give grave advice, and recommend it by the sad\r\ngravity of his brow, and thee, on the other, to trick me into what thou\r\nthinkest my own good, I should have as little the freedom of mine own\r\nwill as any king in Christendom or Heathenesse.\xe2\x80\x94But come, sirs, let us\r\nmerrily on to Coningsburgh, and think no more on\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobin Hood assured them that he had detached a party in the direction\r\nof the road they were to pass, who would not fail to discover and\r\napprize them of any secret ambuscade; and that he had little doubt they\r\nwould find the ways secure, or, if otherwise, would receive such timely\r\nnotice of the danger as would enable them to fall back on a strong\r\ntroop of archers, with which he himself proposed to follow on the same\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nThe wise and attentive precautions adopted for his safety touched\r\nRichard\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, and removed any slight grudge which he might retain\r\non account of the deception the Outlaw Captain had practised upon him.\r\nHe once more extended his hand to Robin Hood, assured him of his full\r\npardon and future favour, as well as his firm resolution to restrain\r\nthe tyrannical exercise of the forest rights and other oppressive laws,\r\nby which so many English yeomen were driven into a state of rebellion.\r\nBut Richard\xe2\x80\x99s good intentions towards the bold Outlaw were frustrated\r\nby the King\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death; and the Charter of the Forest was\r\nextorted from the unwilling hands of King John when he succeeded to his\r\nheroic brother. As for the rest of Robin Hood\xe2\x80\x99s career, as well as the\r\ntale of his treacherous death, they are to be found in those\r\nblack-letter garlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one\r\nhalfpenny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Outlaw\xe2\x80\x99s opinion proved true; and the King, attended by Ivanhoe,\r\nGurth, and Wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the\r\nCastle of Coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.\r\n\r\nThere are few more beautiful or striking scenes in England, than are\r\npresented by the vicinity of this ancient Saxon fortress. The soft and\r\ngentle river Don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation\r\nis richly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the\r\nriver, well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice,\r\nwhich, as its Saxon name implies, was, previous to the Conquest, a\r\nroyal residence of the kings of England. The outer walls have probably\r\nbeen added by the Normans, but the inner keep bears token of very great\r\nantiquity. It is situated on a mount at one angle of the inner court,\r\nand forms a complete circle of perhaps twenty-five feet in diameter.\r\nThe wall is of immense thickness, and is propped or defended by six\r\nhuge external buttresses which project from the circle, and rise up\r\nagainst the sides of the tower as if to strengthen or to support it.\r\nThese massive buttresses are solid when they arise from the foundation,\r\nand a good way higher up; but are hollowed out towards the top, and\r\nterminate in a sort of turrets communicating with the interior of the\r\nkeep itself. The distant appearance of this huge building, with these\r\nsingular accompaniments, is as interesting to the lovers of the\r\npicturesque, as the interior of the castle is to the eager antiquary,\r\nwhose imagination it carries back to the days of the Heptarchy. A\r\nbarrow, in the vicinity of the castle, is pointed out as the tomb of\r\nthe memorable Hengist; and various monuments, of great antiquity and\r\ncuriosity, are shown in the neighbouring churchyard. 57\r\n\r\nWhen C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion and his retinue approached this rude yet stately\r\nbuilding, it was not, as at present, surrounded by external\r\nfortifications. The Saxon architect had exhausted his art in rendering\r\nthe main keep defensible, and there was no other circumvallation than a\r\nrude barrier of palisades.\r\n\r\nA huge black banner, which floated from the top of the tower, announced\r\nthat the obsequies of the late owner were still in the act of being\r\nsolemnized. It bore no emblem of the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s birth or quality, for\r\narmorial bearings were then a novelty among the Norman chivalry\r\nthemselves and, were totally unknown to the Saxons. But above the gate\r\nwas another banner, on which the figure of a white horse, rudely\r\npainted, indicated the nation and rank of the deceased, by the\r\nwell-known symbol of Hengist and his Saxon warriors.\r\n\r\nAll around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral\r\nbanquets were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only\r\nevery one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased,\r\nbut all passengers whatsoever, were invited to partake. The wealth and\r\nconsequence of the deceased Athelstane, occasioned this custom to be\r\nobserved in the fullest extent.\r\n\r\nNumerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the\r\nhill on which the castle was situated; and when the King and his\r\nattendants entered the open and unguarded gates of the external\r\nbarrier, the space within presented a scene not easily reconciled with\r\nthe cause of the assemblage. In one place cooks were toiling to roast\r\nhuge oxen, and fat sheep; in another, hogsheads of ale were set\r\nabroach, to be drained at the freedom of all comers. Groups of every\r\ndescription were to be seen devouring the food and swallowing the\r\nliquor thus abandoned to their discretion. The naked Saxon serf was\r\ndrowning the sense of his half-year\xe2\x80\x99s hunger and thirst, in one day of\r\ngluttony and drunkenness\xe2\x80\x94the more pampered burgess and guild-brother\r\nwas eating his morsel with gust, or curiously criticising the quantity\r\nof the malt and the skill of the brewer. Some few of the poorer Norman\r\ngentry might also be seen, distinguished by their shaven chins and\r\nshort cloaks, and not less so by their keeping together, and looking\r\nwith great scorn on the whole solemnity, even while condescending to\r\navail themselves of the good cheer which was so liberally supplied.\r\n\r\nMendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with\r\nstrolling soldiers returned from Palestine, (according to their own\r\naccount at least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling\r\nmechanics were enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers,\r\nhedge-priests, Saxon minstrels, and Welsh bards, were muttering\r\nprayers, and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, and\r\nrotes. 58\r\n\r\nOne sent forth the praises of Athelstane in a doleful panegyric;\r\nanother, in a Saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh\r\nnames of his noble ancestry. Jesters and jugglers were not awanting,\r\nnor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of\r\ntheir profession indecorous or improper. Indeed the ideas of the Saxons\r\non these occasions were as natural as they were rude. If sorrow was\r\nthirsty, there was drink\xe2\x80\x94if hungry, there was food\xe2\x80\x94if it sunk down upon\r\nand saddened the heart, here were the means supplied of mirth, or at\r\nleast of amusement. Nor did the assistants scorn to avail themselves of\r\nthose means of consolation, although, every now and then, as if\r\nsuddenly recollecting the cause which had brought them together, the\r\nmen groaned in unison, while the females, of whom many were present,\r\nraised up their voices and shrieked for very woe.\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene in the castle-yard at Coningsburgh when it was\r\nentered by Richard and his followers. The seneschal or steward deigned\r\nnot to take notice of the groups of inferior guests who were\r\nperpetually entering and withdrawing, unless so far as was necessary to\r\npreserve order; nevertheless he was struck by the good mien of the\r\nMonarch and Ivanhoe, more especially as he imagined the features of the\r\nlatter were familiar to him. Besides, the approach of two knights, for\r\nsuch their dress bespoke them, was a rare event at a Saxon solemnity,\r\nand could not but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and\r\nhis family. And in his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white\r\nwand of office, this important personage made way through the\r\nmiscellaneous assemblage of guests, thus conducting Richard and Ivanhoe\r\nto the entrance of the tower. Gurth and Wamba speedily found\r\nacquaintances in the court-yard, nor presumed to intrude themselves any\r\nfarther until their presence should be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nI found them winding of Marcello\xe2\x80\x99s corpse.\r\nAnd there was such a solemn melody,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twixt doleful songs, tears, and sad elegies,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nSuch as old grandames, watching by the dead,\r\nAre wont to outwear the night with.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mode of entering the great tower of Coningsburgh Castle is very\r\npeculiar, and partakes of the rude simplicity of the early times in\r\nwhich it was erected. A flight of steps, so deep and narrow as to be\r\nalmost precipitous, leads up to a low portal in the south side of the\r\ntower, by which the adventurous antiquary may still, or at least could\r\na few years since, gain access to a small stair within the thickness of\r\nthe main wall of the tower, which leads up to the third story of the\r\nbuilding,\xe2\x80\x94the two lower being dungeons or vaults, which neither receive\r\nair nor light, save by a square hole in the third story, with which\r\nthey seem to have communicated by a ladder. The access to the upper\r\napartments in the tower which consist in all of four stories, is given\r\nby stairs which are carried up through the external buttresses.\r\n\r\nBy this difficult and complicated entrance, the good King Richard,\r\nfollowed by his faithful Ivanhoe, was ushered into the round apartment\r\nwhich occupies the whole of the third story from the ground. Wilfred,\r\nby the difficulties of the ascent, gained time to muffle his face in\r\nhis mantle, as it had been held expedient that he should not present\r\nhimself to his father until the King should give him the signal.\r\n\r\nThere were assembled in this apartment, around a large oaken table,\r\nabout a dozen of the most distinguished representatives of the Saxon\r\nfamilies in the adjacent counties. They were all old, or, at least,\r\nelderly men; for the younger race, to the great displeasure of the\r\nseniors, had, like Ivanhoe, broken down many of the barriers which\r\nseparated for half a century the Norman victors from the vanquished\r\nSaxons. The downcast and sorrowful looks of these venerable men, their\r\nsilence and their mournful posture, formed a strong contrast to the\r\nlevity of the revellers on the outside of the castle. Their grey locks\r\nand long full beards, together with their antique tunics and loose\r\nblack mantles, suited well with the singular and rude apartment in\r\nwhich they were seated, and gave the appearance of a band of ancient\r\nworshippers of Woden, recalled to life to mourn over the decay of their\r\nnational glory.\r\n\r\nCedric, seated in equal rank among his countrymen, seemed yet, by\r\ncommon consent, to act as chief of the assembly. Upon the entrance of\r\nRichard (only known to him as the valorous Knight of the Fetterlock) he\r\narose gravely, and gave him welcome by the ordinary salutation, \xe2\x80\x9cWaes\r\nhael\xe2\x80\x9d, raising at the same time a goblet to his head. The King, no\r\nstranger to the customs of his English subjects, returned the greeting\r\nwith the appropriate words, \xe2\x80\x9cDrinc hael\xe2\x80\x9d, and partook of a cup which\r\nwas handed to him by the sewer. The same courtesy was offered to\r\nIvanhoe, who pledged his father in silence, supplying the usual speech\r\nby an inclination of his head, lest his voice should have been\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nWhen this introductory ceremony was performed, Cedric arose, and,\r\nextending his hand to Richard, conducted him into a small and very rude\r\nchapel, which was excavated, as it were, out of one of the external\r\nbuttresses. As there was no opening, saving a little narrow loop-hole,\r\nthe place would have been nearly quite dark but for two flambeaux or\r\ntorches, which showed, by a red and smoky light, the arched roof and\r\nnaked walls, the rude altar of stone, and the crucifix of the same\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nBefore this altar was placed a bier, and on each side of this bier\r\nkneeled three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their\r\nprayers, with the greatest signs of external devotion. For this service\r\na splendid \xe2\x80\x9csoul-scat\xe2\x80\x9d was paid to the convent of Saint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s by the\r\nmother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole\r\nbrethren, saving the lame Sacristan, had transferred themselves to\r\nConingsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard\r\nin the performance of divine rites by the bier of Athelstane, the\r\nothers failed not to take their share of the refreshments and\r\namusements which went on at the castle. In maintaining this pious watch\r\nand ward, the good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt\r\ntheir hymns for an instant, lest Zernebock, the ancient Saxon Apollyon,\r\nshould lay his clutches on the departed Athelstane. Nor were they less\r\ncareful to prevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall, which,\r\nhaving been that used at the funeral of Saint Edmund, was liable to be\r\ndesecrated, if handled by the profane. If, in truth, these attentions\r\ncould be of any use to the deceased, he had some right to expect them\r\nat the hands of the brethren of Saint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s, since, besides a\r\nhundred mancuses of gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of\r\nAthelstane had announced her intention of endowing that foundation with\r\nthe better part of the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain\r\nperpetual prayers for his soul, and that of her departed husband.\r\nRichard and Wilfred followed the Saxon Cedric into the apartment of\r\ndeath, where, as their guide pointed with solemn air to the untimely\r\nbier of Athelstane, they followed his example in devoutly crossing\r\nthemselves, and muttering a brief prayer for the weal of the departed\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThis act of pious charity performed, Cedric again motioned them to\r\nfollow him, gliding over the stone floor with a noiseless tread; and,\r\nafter ascending a few steps, opened with great caution the door of a\r\nsmall oratory, which adjoined to the chapel. It was about eight feet\r\nsquare, hollowed, like the chapel itself, out of the thickness of the\r\nwall; and the loop-hole, which enlightened it, being to the west, and\r\nwidening considerably as it sloped inward, a beam of the setting sun\r\nfound its way into its dark recess, and showed a female of a dignified\r\nmien, and whose countenance retained the marked remains of majestic\r\nbeauty. Her long mourning robes and her flowing wimple of black\r\ncypress, enhanced the whiteness of her skin, and the beauty of her\r\nlight-coloured and flowing tresses, which time had neither thinned nor\r\nmingled with silver. Her countenance expressed the deepest sorrow that\r\nis consistent with resignation. On the stone table before her stood a\r\ncrucifix of ivory, beside which was laid a missal, having its pages\r\nrichly illuminated, and its boards adorned with clasps of gold, and\r\nbosses of the same precious metal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoble Edith,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, after having stood a moment silent, as if\r\nto give Richard and Wilfred time to look upon the lady of the mansion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthese are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. And\r\nthis, in especial, is the valiant Knight who fought so bravely for the\r\ndeliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis bravery has my thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the lady; \xe2\x80\x9calthough it be the\r\nwill of Heaven that it should be displayed in vain. I thank, too, his\r\ncourtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to\r\nbehold the widow of Adeling, the mother of Athelstane, in her deep hour\r\nof sorrow and lamentation. To your care, kind kinsman, I intrust them,\r\nsatisfied that they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can\r\nyet afford.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their\r\nhospitable guide.\r\n\r\nAnother winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size\r\nwith that which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story\r\nimmediately above. From this room, ere yet the door was opened,\r\nproceeded a low and melancholy strain of vocal music. When they\r\nentered, they found themselves in the presence of about twenty matrons\r\nand maidens of distinguished Saxon lineage. Four maidens, Rowena\r\nleading the choir, raised a hymn for the soul of the deceased, of which\r\nwe have only been able to decipher two or three stanzas:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDust unto dust,\r\nTo this all must;\r\nThe tenant hath resign\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nThe faded form\r\nTo waste and worm\xe2\x80\x94\r\nCorruption claims her kind.\r\n\r\nThrough paths unknown\r\nThy soul hath flown,\r\nTo seek the realms of woe,\r\nWhere fiery pain\r\nShall purge the stain\r\nOf actions done below.\r\n\r\nIn that sad place,\r\nBy Mary\xe2\x80\x99s grace,\r\nBrief may thy dwelling be\r\nTill prayers and alms,\r\nAnd holy psalms,\r\nShall set the captive free.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female\r\nchoristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was\r\nengaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste\r\ncould compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover the bier of\r\nAthelstane, while the others busied themselves in selecting, from\r\nbaskets of flowers placed before them, garlands, which they intended\r\nfor the same mournful purpose. The behaviour of the maidens was\r\ndecorous, if not marked with deep affliction; but now and then a\r\nwhisper or a smile called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and\r\nhere and there might be seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring\r\nto find out how her mourning-robe became her, than in the dismal\r\nceremony for which they were preparing. Neither was this propensity (if\r\nwe must needs confess the truth) at all diminished by the appearance of\r\ntwo strange knights, which occasioned some looking up, peeping, and\r\nwhispering. Rowena alone, too proud to be vain, paid her greeting to\r\nher deliverer with a graceful courtesy. Her demeanour was serious, but\r\nnot dejected; and it may be doubted whether thoughts of Ivanhoe, and of\r\nthe uncertainty of his fate, did not claim as great a share in her\r\ngravity as the death of her kinsman.\r\n\r\nTo Cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably\r\nclear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so much\r\ndeeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper to\r\nwhisper the explanation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShe was the affianced bride of the noble\r\nAthelstane.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94It may be doubted whether this communication went a far\r\nway to increase Wilfred\xe2\x80\x99s disposition to sympathize with the mourners\r\nof Coningsburgh.\r\n\r\nHaving thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in\r\nwhich the obsequies of Athelstane were celebrated under different\r\nforms, Cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he\r\ninformed them, for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests,\r\nwhose more slight connexion with the deceased might render them\r\nunwilling to join those who were immediately effected by the unhappy\r\nevent. He assured them of every accommodation, and was about to\r\nwithdraw when the Black Knight took his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI crave to remind you, noble Thane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when we last\r\nparted, you promised, for the service I had the fortune to render you,\r\nto grant me a boon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is granted ere named, noble Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cyet, at this sad\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf that also,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cI have bethought me\xe2\x80\x94but my time is\r\nbrief\xe2\x80\x94neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave on\r\nthe noble Athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and\r\nhasty opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Knight of the Fetterlock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, colouring, and\r\ninterrupting the King in his turn, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust your boon regards yourself\r\nand no other; for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is\r\nscarce fitting that a stranger should mingle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor do I wish to mingle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, mildly, \xe2\x80\x9cunless in so far as\r\nyou will admit me to have an interest. As yet you have known me but as\r\nthe Black Knight of the Fetterlock\xe2\x80\x94Know me now as Richard Plantagenet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRichard of Anjou!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cedric, stepping backward with the utmost\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, noble Cedric\xe2\x80\x94Richard of England!\xe2\x80\x94whose deepest interest\xe2\x80\x94whose\r\ndeepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other.\xe2\x80\x94And, how now,\r\nworthy Thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Norman blood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cit hath never bended.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReserve thine homage then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Monarch, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil I shall prove my\r\nright to it by my equal protection of Normans and English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cI have ever done justice to thy bravery and\r\nthy worth\xe2\x80\x94Nor am I ignorant of thy claim to the crown through thy\r\ndescent from Matilda, niece to Edgar Atheling, and daughter to Malcolm\r\nof Scotland. But Matilda, though of the royal Saxon blood, was not the\r\nheir to the monarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not dispute my title with thee, noble Thane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard,\r\ncalmly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will bid thee look around thee, and see where thou wilt\r\nfind another to be put into the scale against it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hast thou wandered hither, Prince, to tell me so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nupbraid me with the ruin of my race, ere the grave has closed o\xe2\x80\x99er the\r\nlast scion of Saxon royalty?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94His countenance darkened as he spoke.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas boldly\xe2\x80\x94it was rashly done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so, by the holy rood!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the King; \xe2\x80\x9cit was done in the frank\r\nconfidence which one brave man may repose in another, without a shadow\r\nof danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou sayest well, Sir King\xe2\x80\x94for King I own thou art, and wilt be,\r\ndespite of my feeble opposition.\xe2\x80\x94I dare not take the only mode to\r\nprevent it, though thou hast placed the strong temptation within my\r\nreach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now to my boon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I ask not with one jot the\r\nless confidence, that thou hast refused to acknowledge my lawful\r\nsovereignty. I require of thee, as a man of thy word, on pain of being\r\nheld faithless, man-sworn, and \xe2\x80\x98nidering\xe2\x80\x99, 581 to forgive and receive\r\nto thy paternal affection the good knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe. In this\r\nreconciliation thou wilt own I have an interest\xe2\x80\x94the happiness of my\r\nfriend, and the quelling of dissension among my faithful people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is Wilfred!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, pointing to his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father!\xe2\x80\x94my father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, prostrating himself at Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet, \xe2\x80\x9cgrant me thy forgiveness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast it, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, raising him up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe son of\r\nHereward knows how to keep his word, even when it has been passed to a\r\nNorman. But let me see thee use the dress and costume of thy English\r\nancestry\xe2\x80\x94no short cloaks, no gay bonnets, no fantastic plumage in my\r\ndecent household. He that would be the son of Cedric, must show himself\r\nof English ancestry.\xe2\x80\x94Thou art about to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI guess the topic. The Lady Rowena must complete two years\xe2\x80\x99 mourning,\r\nas for a betrothed husband\xe2\x80\x94all our Saxon ancestors would disown us were\r\nwe to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should have\r\nwedded\xe2\x80\x94him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and\r\nancestry\xe2\x80\x94is yet closed. The ghost of Athelstane himself would burst his\r\nbloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his\r\nmemory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had he\r\nuttered them ere the door flew open, and Athelstane, arrayed in the\r\ngarments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like\r\nsomething arisen from the dead! 59\r\n\r\nThe effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly\r\nappalling. Cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment\r\nwould permit, and, leaning against it as one unable to support himself,\r\ngazed on the figure of his friend with eyes that seemed fixed, and a\r\nmouth which he appeared incapable of shutting. Ivanhoe crossed himself,\r\nrepeating prayers in Saxon, Latin, or Norman-French, as they occurred\r\nto his memory, while Richard alternately said, \xe2\x80\x9cBenedicite\xe2\x80\x9d, and swore,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMort de ma vie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecure the treacherous monks!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94others, \xe2\x80\x9cDown with them into the\r\ndungeon!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94others, \xe2\x80\x9cPitch them from the highest battlements!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre\r\nof his departed friend, \xe2\x80\x9cif thou art mortal, speak!\xe2\x80\x94if a departed\r\nspirit, say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if I can do aught\r\nthat can set thy spirit at repose.\xe2\x80\x94Living or dead, noble Athelstane,\r\nspeak to Cedric!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said the spectre, very composedly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I have collected\r\nbreath, and when you give me time\xe2\x80\x94Alive, saidst thou?\xe2\x80\x94I am as much\r\nalive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which\r\nseem three ages\xe2\x80\x94Yes, bread and water, Father Cedric! By Heaven, and all\r\nsaints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong\r\ndays, and by God\xe2\x80\x99s providence it is that I am now here to tell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, noble Athelstane,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Black Knight, \xe2\x80\x9cI myself saw you\r\nstruck down by the fierce Templar towards the end of the storm at\r\nTorquilstone, and as I thought, and Wamba reported, your skull was\r\ncloven through the teeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought amiss, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cand Wamba lied. My\r\nteeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find\xe2\x80\x94No\r\nthanks to the Templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that\r\nthe blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good\r\nmace with which I warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, I had not\r\nvalued it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have\r\nspoilt his retreat. But as it was, down I went, stunned, indeed, but\r\nunwounded. Others, of both sides, were beaten down and slaughtered\r\nabove me, so that I never recovered my senses until I found myself in a\r\ncoffin\xe2\x80\x94(an open one, by good luck)\xe2\x80\x94placed before the altar of the\r\nchurch of Saint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s. I sneezed repeatedly\xe2\x80\x94groaned\xe2\x80\x94awakened and\r\nwould have arisen, when the Sacristan and Abbot, full of terror, came\r\nrunning at the noise, surprised, doubtless, and no way pleased to find\r\nthe man alive, whose heirs they had proposed themselves to be. I asked\r\nfor wine\xe2\x80\x94they gave me some, but it must have been highly medicated, for\r\nI slept yet more deeply than before, and wakened not for many hours. I\r\nfound my arms swathed down\xe2\x80\x94my feet tied so fast that mine ankles ache\r\nat the very remembrance\xe2\x80\x94the place was utterly dark\xe2\x80\x94the oubliette, as I\r\nsuppose, of their accursed convent, and from the close, stifled, damp\r\nsmell, I conceive it is also used for a place of sepulture. I had\r\nstrange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my dungeon\r\ncreaked, and two villain monks entered. They would have persuaded me I\r\nwas in purgatory, but I knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice of\r\nthe Father Abbot.\xe2\x80\x94Saint Jeremy! how different from that tone with which\r\nhe used to ask me for another slice of the haunch!\xe2\x80\x94the dog has feasted\r\nwith me from Christmas to Twelfth-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave patience, noble Athelstane,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9ctake breath\xe2\x80\x94tell\r\nyour story at leisure\xe2\x80\x94beshrew me but such a tale is as well worth\r\nlistening to as a romance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy but, by the rood of Bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Athelstane.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA barley loaf and a pitcher of water\xe2\x80\x94that THEY gave\r\nme, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and I myself, had enriched,\r\nwhen their best resources were the flitches of bacon and measures of\r\ncorn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in exchange\r\nfor their prayers\xe2\x80\x94the nest of foul ungrateful vipers\xe2\x80\x94barley bread and\r\nditch water to such a patron as I had been! I will smoke them out of\r\ntheir nest, though I be excommunicated!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, in the name of Our Lady, noble Athelstane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, grasping\r\nthe hand of his friend, \xe2\x80\x9chow didst thou escape this imminent danger\xe2\x80\x94did\r\ntheir hearts relent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid their hearts relent!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Athelstane.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo rocks melt with the\r\nsun? I should have been there still, had not some stir in the Convent,\r\nwhich I find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast,\r\nwhen they well knew how and where I had been buried alive, summoned the\r\nswarm out of their hive. I heard them droning out their death-psalms,\r\nlittle judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who were\r\nthus famishing my body. They went, however, and I waited long for\r\nfood\xe2\x80\x94no wonder\xe2\x80\x94the gouty Sacristan was even too busy with his own\r\nprovender to mind mine. At length down he came, with an unstable step\r\nand a strong flavour of wine and spices about his person. Good cheer\r\nhad opened his heart, for he left me a nook of pasty and a flask of\r\nwine, instead of my former fare. I ate, drank, and was invigorated;\r\nwhen, to add to my good luck, the Sacristan, too totty to discharge his\r\nduty of turnkey fitly, locked the door beside the staple, so that it\r\nfell ajar. The light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. The\r\nstaple to which my chains were fixed, was more rusted than I or the\r\nvillain Abbot had supposed. Even iron could not remain without\r\nconsuming in the damps of that infernal dungeon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake breath, noble Athelstane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, \xe2\x80\x9cand partake of some\r\nrefreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartake!\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cI have been partaking five times\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x94and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign\r\nto the matter; and I pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of\r\nwine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their\r\nresuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:\xe2\x80\x94He had indeed\r\nnow many more auditors than those to whom it was commenced, for Edith,\r\nhaving given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within the\r\nCastle, had followed the dead-alive up to the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s apartment\r\nattended by as many of the guests, male and female, as could squeeze\r\ninto the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up an\r\nerroneous edition of the story, and transmitted it still more\r\ninaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar\r\nwithout, in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact.\r\nAthelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his\r\nescape:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding myself freed from the staple, I dragged myself up stairs as\r\nwell as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might;\r\nand after much groping about, I was at length directed, by the sound of\r\na jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy Sacristan, an it\r\nso please ye, was holding a devil\xe2\x80\x99s mass with a huge beetle-browed,\r\nbroad-shouldered brother of the grey-frock and cowl, who looked much\r\nmore like a thief than a clergyman. I burst in upon them, and the\r\nfashion of my grave-clothes, as well as the clanking of my chains, made\r\nme more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this. Both\r\nstood aghast; but when I knocked down the Sacristan with my fist, the\r\nother fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge\r\nquarter-staff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis must be our Friar Tuck, for a count\xe2\x80\x99s ransom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard,\r\nlooking at Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may be the devil, an he will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane. \xe2\x80\x9cFortunately he\r\nmissed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him, took to his\r\nheels and ran for it. I failed not to set my own heels at liberty by\r\nmeans of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbelt; and I had thoughts of beating out the knave\xe2\x80\x99s brains with the\r\nbunch of keys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of\r\nwine which the rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart;\r\nso, with a brace of hearty kicks, I left him on the floor, pouched some\r\nbaked meat, and a leathern bottle of wine, with which the two venerable\r\nbrethren had been regaling, went to the stable, and found in a private\r\nstall mine own best palfrey, which, doubtless, had been set apart for\r\nthe holy Father Abbot\xe2\x80\x99s particular use. Hither I came with all the\r\nspeed the beast could compass\xe2\x80\x94man and mother\xe2\x80\x99s son flying before me\r\nwherever I came, taking me for a spectre, the more especially as, to\r\nprevent my being recognised, I drew the corpse-hood over my face. I had\r\nnot gained admittance into my own castle, had I not been supposed to be\r\nthe attendant of a juggler who is making the people in the castle-yard\r\nvery merry, considering they are assembled to celebrate their lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuneral\xe2\x80\x94I say the sewer thought I was dressed to bear a part in the\r\ntregetour\xe2\x80\x99s mummery, and so I got admission, and did but disclose\r\nmyself to my mother, and eat a hasty morsel, ere I came in quest of\r\nyou, my noble friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have found me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric, \xe2\x80\x9cready to resume our brave\r\nprojects of honour and liberty. I tell thee, never will dawn a morrow\r\nso auspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble Saxon\r\nrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk not to me of delivering any one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cit is well I\r\nam delivered myself. I am more intent on punishing that villain Abbot.\r\nHe shall hang on the top of this Castle of Coningsburgh, in his cope\r\nand stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, I\r\nwill have him craned up from without.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider his sacred office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider my three days\xe2\x80\x99 fast,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cI will have their\r\nblood every one of them. Front-de-B\xc5\x93uf was burnt alive for a less\r\nmatter, for he kept a good table for his prisoners, only put too much\r\ngarlic in his last dish of pottage. But these hypocritical, ungrateful\r\nslaves, so often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave me\r\nneither pottage nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of\r\nHengist!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the Pope, my noble friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said Cedric\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the devil, my noble friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94answered Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cthey die, and\r\nno more of them. Were they the best monks upon earth, the world would\r\ngo on without them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, noble Athelstane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cforget such wretches in\r\nthe career of glory which lies open before thee. Tell this Norman\r\nprince, Richard of Anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not\r\nhold undisputed the throne of Alfred, while a male descendant of the\r\nHoly Confessor lives to dispute it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cis this the noble King Richard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Richard Plantagenet himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric; \xe2\x80\x9cyet I need not\r\nremind thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be\r\ninjured nor detained prisoner\xe2\x80\x94thou well knowest thy duty to him as his\r\nhost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, by my faith!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane; \xe2\x80\x9cand my duty as a subject besides,\r\nfor I here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edith, \xe2\x80\x9cthink on thy royal rights!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink on the freedom of England, degenerate Prince!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother and friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9ca truce to your\r\nupbraidings\xe2\x80\x94bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of\r\nambition, and I rise from the tomb a wiser man than I descended into\r\nit. One half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that\r\nperfidious Abbot Wolfram, and you may now judge if he is a counsellor\r\nto be trusted. Since these plots were set in agitation, I have had\r\nnothing but hurried journeys, indigestions, blows and bruises,\r\nimprisonments and starvation; besides that they can only end in the\r\nmurder of some thousands of quiet folk. I tell you, I will be king in\r\nmy own domains, and nowhere else; and my first act of dominion shall be\r\nto hang the Abbot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my ward Rowena,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cedric\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI trust you intend not to desert\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Cedric,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cbe reasonable. The Lady Rowena cares\r\nnot for me\xe2\x80\x94she loves the little finger of my kinsman Wilfred\xe2\x80\x99s glove\r\nbetter than my whole person. There she stands to avouch it\xe2\x80\x94Nay, blush\r\nnot, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better\r\nthan a country franklin\xe2\x80\x94and do not laugh neither, Rowena, for\r\ngrave-clothes and a thin visage are, God knows, no matter of\r\nmerriment\xe2\x80\x94Nay, an thou wilt needs laugh, I will find thee a better\r\njest\xe2\x80\x94Give me thy hand, or rather lend it me, for I but ask it in the\r\nway of friendship.\xe2\x80\x94Here, cousin Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in thy favour I\r\nrenounce and abjure\xe2\x80\x94-Hey! by Saint Dunstan, our cousin Wilfred hath\r\nvanished!\xe2\x80\x94Yet, unless my eyes are still dazzled with the fasting I have\r\nundergone, I saw him stand there but even now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll now looked around and enquired for Ivanhoe, but he had vanished. It\r\nwas at length discovered that a Jew had been to seek him; and that,\r\nafter very brief conference, he had called for Gurth and his armour,\r\nand had left the castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFair cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane to Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9ccould I think that this\r\nsudden disappearance of Ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the\r\nweightiest reason, I would myself resume\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that Ivanhoe\r\nhad disappeared, than Rowena, who had found her situation extremely\r\nembarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cwomen are the least to be trusted of\r\nall animals, monks and abbots excepted. I am an infidel, if I expected\r\nnot thanks from her, and perhaps a kiss to boot\xe2\x80\x94These cursed\r\ngrave-clothes have surely a spell on them, every one flies from me.\xe2\x80\x94To\r\nyou I turn, noble King Richard, with the vows of allegiance, which, as\r\na liege-subject\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut King Richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. At length it\r\nwas learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his\r\npresence the Jew who had spoken with Ivanhoe, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech with him, had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a\r\nsteed, compelled the Jew to mount another, and set off at a rate,\r\nwhich, according to Wamba, rendered the old Jew\xe2\x80\x99s neck not worth a\r\npenny\xe2\x80\x99s purchase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my halidome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Athelstane, \xe2\x80\x9cit is certain that Zernebock hath\r\npossessed himself of my castle in my absence. I return in my\r\ngrave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one\r\nI speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!\xe2\x80\x94But it skills not\r\ntalking of it. Come, my friends\xe2\x80\x94such of you as are left, follow me to\r\nthe banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear\xe2\x80\x94it is, I trust, as yet\r\ntolerably furnished, as becomes the obsequies of an ancient Saxon\r\nnoble; and should we tarry any longer, who knows but the devil may fly\r\noff with the supper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBe Mowbray\xe2\x80\x99s sins so heavy in his bosom,\r\nThat they may break his foaming courser\xe2\x80\x99s back,\r\nAnd throw the rider headlong in the lists,\r\nA caitiff recreant!\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD II\r\n\r\n\r\nOur scene now returns to the exterior of the Castle, or Preceptory, of\r\nTemplestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the\r\nlife or death of Rebecca. It was a scene of bustle and life, as if the\r\nwhole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or\r\nrural feast. But the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not\r\npeculiar to those dark ages; though in the gladiatorial exercise of\r\nsingle combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody\r\nspectacle of brave men falling by each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Even in our own\r\ndays, when morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising\r\nmatch, a riot, or a meeting of radical reformers, collects, at\r\nconsiderable hazard to themselves, immense crowds of spectators,\r\notherwise little interested, except to see how matters are to be\r\nconducted, or whether the heroes of the day are, in the heroic language\r\nof insurgent tailors, flints or dunghills.\r\n\r\nThe eyes, therefore, of a very considerable multitude, were bent on the\r\ngate of the Preceptory of Templestowe, with the purpose of witnessing\r\nthe procession; while still greater numbers had already surrounded the\r\ntiltyard belonging to that establishment. This enclosure was formed on\r\na piece of level ground adjoining to the Preceptory, which had been\r\nlevelled with care, for the exercise of military and chivalrous sports.\r\nIt occupied the brow of a soft and gentle eminence, was carefully\r\npalisaded around, and, as the Templars willingly invited spectators to\r\nbe witnesses of their skill in feats of chivalry, was amply supplied\r\nwith galleries and benches for their use.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, a throne was erected for the Grand Master at\r\nthe east end, surrounded with seats of distinction for the Preceptors\r\nand Knights of the Order. Over these floated the sacred standard,\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cLe Beau-seant\xe2\x80\x9d, which was the ensign, as its name was the\r\nbattle-cry, of the Templars.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the lists was a pile of faggots, so arranged\r\naround a stake, deeply fixed in the ground, as to leave a space for the\r\nvictim whom they were destined to consume, to enter within the fatal\r\ncircle, in order to be chained to the stake by the fetters which hung\r\nready for that purpose. Beside this deadly apparatus stood four black\r\nslaves, whose colour and African features, then so little known in\r\nEngland, appalled the multitude, who gazed on them as on demons\r\nemployed about their own diabolical exercises. These men stirred not,\r\nexcepting now and then, under the direction of one who seemed their\r\nchief, to shift and replace the ready fuel. They looked not on the\r\nmultitude. In fact, they seemed insensible of their presence, and of\r\nevery thing save the discharge of their own horrible duty.\r\n\r\nAnd when, in speech with each other, they expanded their blubber lips,\r\nand showed their white fangs, as if they grinned at the thoughts of the\r\nexpected tragedy, the startled commons could scarcely help believing\r\nthat they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had\r\ncommuned, and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her\r\ndreadful punishment. They whispered to each other, and communicated all\r\nthe feats which Satan had performed during that busy and unhappy\r\nperiod, not failing, of course, to give the devil rather more than his\r\ndue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not heard, Father Dennet,\xe2\x80\x9d quoth one boor to another advanced\r\nin years, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the devil has carried away bodily the great Saxon\r\nThane, Athelstane of Coningsburgh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of God and Saint\r\nDunstan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock\r\nembroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a\r\nharp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. The Minstrel seemed of\r\nno vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered\r\ndoublet, he wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwrest\xe2\x80\x9d, or key, with which he tuned his harp. On his right arm was a\r\nsilver plate, which, instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or\r\nbadge of the baron to whose family he belonged, had barely the word\r\nSHERWOOD engraved upon it.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow mean you by that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the gay\r\nMinstrel, mingling in the conversation of the peasants; \xe2\x80\x9cI came to seek\r\none subject for my rhyme, and, by\xe2\x80\x99r Lady, I were glad to find two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well avouched,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder peasant, \xe2\x80\x9cthat after Athelstane\r\nof Coningsburgh had been dead four weeks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minstrel; \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him in life at the\r\nPassage of Arms at Ashby-de-la-Zouche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead, however, he was, or else translated,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger peasant;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor I heard the Monks of Saint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s singing the death\xe2\x80\x99s hymn for\r\nhim; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the Castle\r\nof Coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had I gone, but for Mabel\r\nParkins, who\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, dead was Athelstane,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nmore pity it was, for the old Saxon blood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, your story, my masters\xe2\x80\x94your story,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minstrel, somewhat\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay\xe2\x80\x94construe us the story,\xe2\x80\x9d said a burly Friar, who stood beside\r\nthem, leaning on a pole that exhibited an appearance between a\r\npilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s staff and a quarter-staff, and probably acted as either when\r\noccasion served,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYour story,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stalwart churchman; \xe2\x80\x9cburn not\r\ndaylight about it\xe2\x80\x94we have short time to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn please your reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennet, \xe2\x80\x9ca drunken priest came to\r\nvisit the Sacristan at Saint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not please my reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the churchman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there\r\nshould be such an animal as a drunken priest, or, if there were, that a\r\nlayman should so speak him. Be mannerly, my friend, and conclude the\r\nholy man only wrapt in meditation, which makes the head dizzy and foot\r\nunsteady, as if the stomach were filled with new wine\xe2\x80\x94I have felt it\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Father Dennet, \xe2\x80\x9ca holy brother came to visit the\r\nSacristan at Saint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a sort of hedge-priest is the visitor, and\r\nkills half the deer that are stolen in the forest, who loves the\r\ntinkling of a pint-pot better than the sacring-bell, and deems a flitch\r\nof bacon worth ten of his breviary; for the rest, a good fellow and a\r\nmerry, who will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a\r\nCheshire round, with e\xe2\x80\x99er a man in Yorkshire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat last part of thy speech, Dennet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minstrel, \xe2\x80\x9chas saved\r\nthee a rib or twain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTush, man, I fear him not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennet; \xe2\x80\x9cI am somewhat old and stiff,\r\nbut when I fought for the bell and ram at Doncaster\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the story\xe2\x80\x94the story, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d again said the Minstrel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the tale is but this\xe2\x80\x94Athelstane of Coningsburgh was buried at\r\nSaint Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a lie, and a loud one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I saw him borne to\r\nhis own Castle of Coningsburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, then, e\xe2\x80\x99en tell the story yourself, my masters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dennet,\r\nturning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some\r\ndifficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of his\r\ncomrade and the Minstrel, to renew his tale.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThese two \xe2\x80\x98sober\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfriars,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at length, \xe2\x80\x9csince this reverend man will needs have\r\nthem such, had continued drinking good ale, and wine, and what not, for\r\nthe best part for a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day, when they were aroused by a deep\r\ngroan, and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased\r\nAthelstane entered the apartment, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Ye evil shep-herds!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is false,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, hastily, \xe2\x80\x9che never spoke a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo ho! Friar Tuck,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minstrel, drawing him apart from the\r\nrustics; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have started a new hare, I find.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee, Allan-a-Dale,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Hermit, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw Athelstane of\r\nConingsburgh as much as bodily eyes ever saw a living man. He had his\r\nshroud on, and all about him smelt of the sepulchre\xe2\x80\x94A butt of sack will\r\nnot wash it out of my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Minstrel; \xe2\x80\x9cthou dost but jest with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Friar, \xe2\x80\x9can I fetched not a knock at him\r\nwith my quarter-staff that would have felled an ox, and it glided\r\nthrough his body as it might through a pillar of smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Saint Hubert,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Minstrel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is a wondrous tale, and\r\nfit to be put in metre to the ancient tune, \xe2\x80\x98Sorrow came to the old\r\nFriar.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh, if ye list,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friar Tuck; \xe2\x80\x9cbut an ye catch me singing on\r\nsuch a theme, may the next ghost or devil carry me off with him\r\nheadlong! No, no\xe2\x80\x94I instantly formed the purpose of assisting at some\r\ngood work, such as the burning of a witch, a judicial combat, or the\r\nlike matter of godly service, and therefore am I here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they thus conversed, the heavy bell of the church of Saint Michael\r\nof Templestowe, a venerable building, situated in a hamlet at some\r\ndistance from the Preceptory, broke short their argument. One by one\r\nthe sullen sounds fell successively on the ear, leaving but sufficient\r\nspace for each to die away in distant echo, ere the air was again\r\nfilled by repetition of the iron knell. These sounds, the signal of the\r\napproaching ceremony, chilled with awe the hearts of the assembled\r\nmultitude, whose eyes were now turned to the Preceptory, expecting the\r\napproach of the Grand Master, the champion, and the criminal.\r\n\r\nAt length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing\r\nthe great standard of the Order, sallied from the castle, preceded by\r\nsix trumpets, and followed by the Knights Preceptors, two and two, the\r\nGrand Master coming last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture\r\nwas of the simplest kind. Behind him came Brian de Bois-Guilbert, armed\r\ncap-a-pie in bright armour, but without his lance, shield, and sword,\r\nwhich were borne by his two esquires behind him. His face, though\r\npartly hidden by a long plume which floated down from his barrel-cap,\r\nbore a strong and mingled expression of passion, in which pride seemed\r\nto contend with irresolution. He looked ghastly pale, as if he had not\r\nslept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the\r\nhabitual ease and grace proper to the best lance of the Order of the\r\nTemple. His general appearance was grand and commanding; but, looking\r\nat him with attention, men read that in his dark features, from which\r\nthey willingly withdrew their eyes.\r\n\r\nOn either side rode Conrade of Mont-Fitchet, and Albert de Malvoisin,\r\nwho acted as godfathers to the champion. They were in their robes of\r\npeace, the white dress of the Order. Behind them followed other\r\nCompanions of the Temple, with a long train of esquires and pages clad\r\nin black, aspirants to the honour of being one day Knights of the\r\nOrder. After these neophytes came a guard of warders on foot, in the\r\nsame sable livery, amidst whose partisans might be seen the pale form\r\nof the accused, moving with a slow but undismayed step towards the\r\nscene of her fate. She was stript of all her ornaments, lest perchance\r\nthere should be among them some of those amulets which Satan was\r\nsupposed to bestow upon his victims, to deprive them of the power of\r\nconfession even when under the torture. A coarse white dress, of the\r\nsimplest form, had been substituted for her Oriental garments; yet\r\nthere was such an exquisite mixture of courage and resignation in her\r\nlook, that even in this garb, and with no other ornament than her long\r\nblack tresses, each eye wept that looked upon her, and the most\r\nhardened bigot regretted the fate that had converted a creature so\r\ngoodly into a vessel of wrath, and a waged slave of the devil.\r\n\r\nA crowd of inferior personages belonging to the Preceptory followed the\r\nvictim, all moving with the utmost order, with arms folded, and looks\r\nbent upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThis slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of\r\nwhich was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around\r\nthem from right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a\r\nhalt. There was then a momentary bustle, while the Grand Master and all\r\nhis attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted\r\nfrom their horses, which were immediately removed out of the lists by\r\nthe esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near\r\nthe pile. On her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations\r\nwere making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the\r\nbody, she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally\r\ndoubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. In the space\r\nof a minute she opened her eyes, looked fixedly on the pile as if to\r\nfamiliarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally\r\nturned away her head.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Grand Master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry\r\nof his order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank, a\r\nloud and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the Court were\r\nseated for judgment. Malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the\r\nchampion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the Jewess, which was\r\nthe pledge of battle, at the feet of the Grand Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValorous Lord, and reverend Father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chere standeth the good\r\nKnight, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Knight Preceptor of the Order of the\r\nTemple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which I now lay at your\r\nreverence\xe2\x80\x99s feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this\r\nday, to maintain that this Jewish maiden, by name Rebecca, hath justly\r\ndeserved the doom passed upon her in a Chapter of this most Holy Order\r\nof the Temple of Zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;\xe2\x80\x94here, I\r\nsay, he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such\r\nbe your noble and sanctified pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHath he made oath,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his quarrel is just\r\nand honourable? Bring forward the Crucifix and the \xe2\x80\x98Te igitur\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, and most reverend father,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Malvoisin, readily, \xe2\x80\x9cour\r\nbrother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation\r\nin the hand of the good Knight Conrade de Mont-Fitchet; and otherwise\r\nhe ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever,\r\nand may take no oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis explanation was satisfactory, to Albert\xe2\x80\x99s great joy; for the wily\r\nknight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of\r\nprevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert to take such an oath before the\r\nassembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master, having allowed the apology of Albert Malvoisin,\r\ncommanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. The trumpets\r\nthen again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed\r\naloud,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOyez, oyez, oyez.\xe2\x80\x94Here standeth the good Knight, Sir Brian de\r\nBois-Guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who\r\nwill sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the Jewess Rebecca, to\r\ntry by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to\r\nsuch champion the reverend and valorous Grand Master here present\r\nallows a fair field, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever\r\nelse appertains to a fair combat.\xe2\x80\x9d The trumpets again sounded, and\r\nthere was a dead pause of many minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo champion appears for the appellant,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master. \xe2\x80\x9cGo,\r\nherald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her in\r\nthis her cause.\xe2\x80\x9d The herald went to the chair in which Rebecca was\r\nseated, and Bois-Guilbert suddenly turning his horse\xe2\x80\x99s head toward that\r\nend of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from Malvoisin and\r\nMont-Fitchet, was by the side of Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s chair as soon as the herald.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this regular, and according to the law of combat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin,\r\nlooking to the Grand Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlbert de Malvoisin, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Beaumanoir; \xe2\x80\x9cfor in this appeal\r\nto the judgment of God, we may not prohibit parties from having that\r\ncommunication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the\r\ntruth of the quarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the herald spoke to Rebecca in these terms:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDamsel,\r\nthe Honourable and Reverend the Grand Master demands of thee, if thou\r\nart prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if\r\nthou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay to the Grand Master,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I maintain my\r\ninnocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest I become\r\nguilty of mine own blood. Say to him, that I challenge such delay as\r\nhis forms will permit, to see if God, whose opportunity is in man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextremity, will raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space\r\nis passed, may His holy will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d The herald retired to carry this\r\nanswer to the Grand Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lucas Beaumanoir, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Jew or Pagan should impeach\r\nus of injustice!\xe2\x80\x94Until the shadows be cast from the west to the\r\neastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this\r\nunfortunate woman. When the day is so far passed, let her prepare for\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe herald communicated the words of the Grand Master to Rebecca, who\r\nbowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards\r\nheaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce\r\npromise herself from man. During this awful pause, the voice of\r\nBois-Guilbert broke upon her ear\xe2\x80\x94it was but a whisper, yet it startled\r\nher more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nunfortunate maiden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, but dost thou understand my words?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nsound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. I scarce know on what\r\nground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.\xe2\x80\x94This\r\nlisted space\xe2\x80\x94that chair\xe2\x80\x94these faggots\xe2\x80\x94I know their purpose, and yet it\r\nappears to me like something unreal\xe2\x80\x94the fearful picture of a vision,\r\nwhich appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but convinces not my\r\nreason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind and senses keep touch and time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell\r\nme alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body,\r\nand open a painful but a brief passage to a better world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreams, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x94dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Templar; \xe2\x80\x9cidle visions,\r\nrejected by the wisdom of your own wiser Sadducees. Hear me, Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, proceeding with animation; \xe2\x80\x9ca better chance hast thou for life\r\nand liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. Mount thee behind\r\nme on my steed\xe2\x80\x94on Zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his rider.\r\nI won him in single fight from the Soldan of Trebizond\xe2\x80\x94mount, I say,\r\nbehind me\xe2\x80\x94in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind\xe2\x80\x94a new\r\nworld of pleasure opens to thee\xe2\x80\x94to me a new career of fame. Let them\r\nspeak the doom which I despise, and erase the name of Bois-Guilbert\r\nfrom their list of monastic slaves! I will wash out with blood whatever\r\nblot they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTempter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cbegone!\xe2\x80\x94Not in this last extremity canst thou\r\nmove me one hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth from my resting place\xe2\x80\x94surrounded as I am by\r\nfoes, I hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy\xe2\x80\x94avoid thee, in the\r\nname of God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlbert Malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their\r\nconference, now advanced to interrupt it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?\xe2\x80\x9d he demanded of Bois-Guilbert;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cor is she resolute in her denial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is indeed resolute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bois-Guilbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin, \xe2\x80\x9cmust thou, noble brother, resume thy place to\r\nattend the issue\xe2\x80\x94The shades are changing on the circle of the\r\ndial\xe2\x80\x94Come, brave Bois-Guilbert\xe2\x80\x94come, thou hope of our holy Order, and\r\nsoon to be its head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke in this soothing tone, he laid his hand on the knight\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbridle, as if to lead him back to his station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFalse villain! what meanest thou by thy hand on my rein?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nBrian, angrily. And shaking off his companion\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, he rode back to\r\nthe upper end of the lists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is yet spirit in him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin apart to Mont-Fitchet,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwere it well directed\xe2\x80\x94but, like the Greek fire, it burns whatever\r\napproaches it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judges had now been two hours in the lists, awaiting in vain the\r\nappearance of a champion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd reason good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Friar Tuck, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing she is a Jewess\xe2\x80\x94and yet, by\r\nmine Order, it is hard that so young and beautiful a creature should\r\nperish without one blow being struck in her behalf! Were she ten times\r\na witch, provided she were but the least bit of a Christian, my\r\nquarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce\r\nTemplar, ere he carried the matter off thus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear\r\nfor a Jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by\r\nMalvoisin, whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the\r\npledge of Rebecca forfeited. At this instant a knight, urging his horse\r\nto speed, appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists. A hundred\r\nvoices exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cA champion! a champion!\xe2\x80\x9d And despite the\r\nprepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted\r\nunanimously as the knight rode into the tiltyard. The second glance,\r\nhowever, served to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had\r\nexcited. His horse, urged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared\r\nto reel from fatigue, and the rider, however undauntedly he presented\r\nhimself in the lists, either from weakness, weariness, or both, seemed\r\nscarce able to support himself in the saddle.\r\n\r\nTo the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and\r\npurpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a good\r\nknight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just\r\nand lawful quarrel of this damsel, Rebecca, daughter of Isaac of York;\r\nto uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless,\r\nand to defy Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and\r\nliar; as I will prove in this field with my body against his, by the\r\naid of God, of Our Lady, and of Monseigneur Saint George, the good\r\nknight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stranger must first show,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malvoisin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he is good\r\nknight, and of honourable lineage. The Temple sendeth not forth her\r\nchampions against nameless men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight, raising his helmet, \xe2\x80\x9cis better known, my\r\nlineage more pure, Malvoisin, than thine own. I am Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not fight with thee at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar, in a changed\r\nand hollow voice. \xe2\x80\x9cGet thy wounds healed, purvey thee a better horse,\r\nand it may be I will hold it worth my while to scourge out of thee this\r\nboyish spirit of bravado.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa! proud Templar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9chast thou forgotten that twice\r\ndidst thou fall before this lance? Remember the lists at Acre\xe2\x80\x94remember\r\nthe Passage of Arms at Ashby\xe2\x80\x94remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of\r\nRotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that\r\nthou wouldst do battle with Wilfred of Ivanhoe, and recover the honour\r\nthou hadst lost! By that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, I\r\nwill proclaim thee, Templar, a coward in every court in Europe\xe2\x80\x94in every\r\nPreceptory of thine Order\xe2\x80\x94unless thou do battle without farther delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBois-Guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards Rebecca, and\r\nthen exclaimed, looking fiercely at Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9cDog of a Saxon! take thy\r\nlance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the Grand Master allow me the combat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may not deny what thou hast challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprovided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. Yet I would thou\r\nwert in better plight to do battle. An enemy of our Order hast thou\r\never been, yet would I have thee honourably met with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus\xe2\x80\x94thus as I am, and not otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the\r\njudgment of God\xe2\x80\x94to his keeping I commend myself.\xe2\x80\x94Rebecca,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nriding up to the fatal chair, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou accept of me for thy\r\nchampion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d fluttered by an emotion which the fear of\r\ndeath had been unable to produce, \xe2\x80\x9cI do accept thee as the champion\r\nwhom Heaven hath sent me. Yet, no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94thy wounds are uncured\xe2\x80\x94Meet not\r\nthat proud man\xe2\x80\x94why shouldst thou perish also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and\r\nassumed his lance. Bois-Guilbert did the same; and his esquire\r\nremarked, as he clasped his visor, that his face, which had,\r\nnotwithstanding the variety of emotions by which he had been agitated,\r\ncontinued during the whole morning of an ashy paleness, was now become\r\nsuddenly very much flushed.\r\n\r\nThe herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his\r\nvoice, repeating thrice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFaites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!\xe2\x80\x9d After\r\nthe third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again\r\nproclaimed, that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word,\r\ncry, or action, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat.\r\nThe Grand Master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglove, now threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cLaissez aller\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nThe trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full\r\ncareer. The wearied horse of Ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider,\r\nwent down, as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and\r\nvigorous steed of the Templar. This issue of the combat all had\r\nforeseen; but although the spear of Ivanhoe did but, in comparison,\r\ntouch the shield of Bois-Guilbert, that champion, to the astonishment\r\nof all who beheld it reeled in his saddle, lost his stirrups, and fell\r\nin the lists.\r\n\r\nIvanhoe, extricating himself from his fallen horse, was soon on foot,\r\nhastening to mend his fortune with his sword; but his antagonist arose\r\nnot. Wilfred, placing his foot on his breast, and the sword\xe2\x80\x99s point to\r\nhis throat, commanded him to yield him, or die on the spot.\r\nBois-Guilbert returned no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlay him not, Sir Knight,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cunshriven and\r\nunabsolved\xe2\x80\x94kill not body and soul! We allow him vanquished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe descended into the lists, and commanded them to unhelm the conquered\r\nchampion. His eyes were closed\xe2\x80\x94the dark red flush was still on his\r\nbrow. As they looked on him in astonishment, the eyes opened\xe2\x80\x94but they\r\nwere fixed and glazed. The flush passed from his brow, and gave way to\r\nthe pallid hue of death. Unscathed by the lance of his enemy, he had\r\ndied a victim to the violence of his own contending passions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is indeed the judgment of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, looking\r\nupwards\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Fiat voluntas tua!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSo! now \xe2\x80\x99tis ended, like an old wife\xe2\x80\x99s story.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEBSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first moments of surprise were over, Wilfred of Ivanhoe\r\ndemanded of the Grand Master, as judge of the field, if he had manfully\r\nand rightfully done his duty in the combat? \xe2\x80\x9cManfully and rightfully\r\nhath it been done,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master. \xe2\x80\x9cI pronounce the maiden free\r\nand guiltless\xe2\x80\x94The arms and the body of the deceased knight are at the\r\nwill of the victor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not despoil him of his weapons,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Knight of Ivanhoe,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnor condemn his corpse to shame\xe2\x80\x94he hath fought for Christendom\xe2\x80\x94God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm, no human hand, hath this day struck him down. But let his\r\nobsequies be private, as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust\r\nquarrel.\xe2\x80\x94And for the maiden\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a clattering of horses\xe2\x80\x99 feet, advancing in such\r\nnumbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the\r\nBlack Knight galloped into the lists. He was followed by a numerous\r\nband of men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking around him. \xe2\x80\x9cI had doomed\r\nBois-Guilbert for mine own property.\xe2\x80\x94Ivanhoe, was this well, to take on\r\nthee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven, my Liege,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ivanhoe, \xe2\x80\x9chath taken this proud man for\r\nits victim. He was not to be honoured in dying as your will had\r\ndesigned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace be with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard, looking steadfastly on the corpse,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif it may be so\xe2\x80\x94he was a gallant knight, and has died in his steel\r\nharness full knightly. But we must waste no time\xe2\x80\x94Bohun, do thine\r\noffice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Knight stepped forward from the King\xe2\x80\x99s attendants, and, laying his\r\nhand on the shoulder of Albert de Malvoisin, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI arrest thee of\r\nHigh Treason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master had hitherto stood astonished at the appearance of so\r\nmany warriors.\xe2\x80\x94He now spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho dares to arrest a Knight of the Temple of Zion, within the girth\r\nof his own Preceptory, and in the presence of the Grand Master? and by\r\nwhose authority is this bold outrage offered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make the arrest,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Knight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI, Henry Bohun, Earl of Essex,\r\nLord High Constable of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he arrests Malvoisin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, raising his visor, \xe2\x80\x9cby the\r\norder of Richard Plantagenet, here present.\xe2\x80\x94Conrade Mont-Fitchet, it is\r\nwell for thee thou art born no subject of mine.\xe2\x80\x94But for thee,\r\nMalvoisin, thou diest with thy brother Philip, ere the world be a week\r\nolder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will resist thy doom,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud Templar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King, \xe2\x80\x9cthou canst not\xe2\x80\x94look up, and behold the\r\nRoyal Standard of England floats over thy towers instead of thy Temple\r\nbanner!\xe2\x80\x94Be wise, Beaumanoir, and make no bootless opposition\xe2\x80\x94Thy hand\r\nis in the lion\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will appeal to Rome against thee,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nusurpation on the immunities and privileges of our Order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the King; \xe2\x80\x9cbut for thine own sake tax me not with\r\nusurpation now. Dissolve thy Chapter, and depart with thy followers to\r\nthy next Preceptory, (if thou canst find one), which has not been made\r\nthe scene of treasonable conspiracy against the King of England\xe2\x80\x94Or, if\r\nthou wilt, remain, to share our hospitality, and behold our justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be a guest in the house where I should command?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Templar;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnever!\xe2\x80\x94Chaplains, raise the Psalm, \xe2\x80\x98Quare fremuerunt Gentes?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Knights,\r\nsquires, and followers of the Holy Temple, prepare to follow the banner\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98Beau-seant!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master spoke with a dignity which confronted even that of\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x99s king himself, and inspired courage into his surprised and\r\ndismayed followers. They gathered around him like the sheep around the\r\nwatch-dog, when they hear the baying of the wolf. But they evinced not\r\nthe timidity of the scared flock\xe2\x80\x94there were dark brows of defiance, and\r\nlooks which menaced the hostility they dared not to proffer in words.\r\nThey drew together in a dark line of spears, from which the white\r\ncloaks of the knights were visible among the dusky garments of their\r\nretainers, like the lighter-coloured edges of a sable cloud. The\r\nmultitude, who had raised a clamorous shout of reprobation, paused and\r\ngazed in silence on the formidable and experienced body to which they\r\nhad unwarily bade defiance, and shrunk back from their front.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Essex, when he beheld them pause in their assembled force,\r\ndashed the rowels into his charger\xe2\x80\x99s sides, and galloped backwards and\r\nforwards to array his followers, in opposition to a band so formidable.\r\nRichard alone, as if he loved the danger his presence had provoked,\r\nrode slowly along the front of the Templars, calling aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\r\nsirs! Among so many gallant knights, will none dare splinter a spear\r\nwith Richard?\xe2\x80\x94Sirs of the Temple! your ladies are but sun-burned, if\r\nthey are not worth the shiver of a broken lance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Brethren of the Temple,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Grand Master, riding forward in\r\nadvance of their body, \xe2\x80\x9cfight not on such idle and profane quarrel\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot with thee, Richard of England, shall a Templar cross lance in my\r\npresence. The Pope and Princes of Europe shall judge our quarrel, and\r\nwhether a Christian prince has done well in bucklering the cause which\r\nthou hast to-day adopted. If unassailed, we depart assailing no one. To\r\nthine honour we refer the armour and household goods of the Order which\r\nwe leave behind us, and on thy conscience we lay the scandal and\r\noffence thou hast this day given to Christendom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these words, and without waiting a reply, the Grand Master gave\r\nthe signal of departure. Their trumpets sounded a wild march, of an\r\nOriental character, which formed the usual signal for the Templars to\r\nadvance. They changed their array from a line to a column of march, and\r\nmoved off as slowly as their horses could step, as if to show it was\r\nonly the will of their Grand Master, and no fear of the opposing and\r\nsuperior force, which compelled them to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the splendour of Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s brow!\xe2\x80\x9d said King Richard, \xe2\x80\x9cit is pity\r\nof their lives that these Templars are not so trusty as they are\r\ndisciplined and valiant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of\r\nits challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of\r\nthe squadron left the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring the tumult which attended the retreat of the Templars, Rebecca\r\nsaw and heard nothing\xe2\x80\x94she was locked in the arms of her aged father,\r\ngiddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances\r\naround her. But one word from Isaac at length recalled her scattered\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear daughter, my recovered treasure\xe2\x80\x94let us\r\ngo to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cO no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I must not at this moment dare to\r\nspeak to him\xe2\x80\x94Alas! I should say more than\xe2\x80\x94No, my father, let us\r\ninstantly leave this evil place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, \xe2\x80\x9cto leave him who hath come forth like\r\na strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing, so\r\nhe might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a people\r\nstrange unto him and his\xe2\x80\x94this is service to be thankfully\r\nacknowledged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94most thankfully\xe2\x80\x94most devoutly acknowledged,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRebecca\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit shall be still more so\xe2\x80\x94but not now\xe2\x80\x94for the sake of thy\r\nbeloved Rachel, father, grant my request\xe2\x80\x94not now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, but,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isaac, insisting, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will deem us more thankless\r\nthan mere dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou seest, my dear father, that King Richard is in presence, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94-\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, my best\xe2\x80\x94my wisest Rebecca!\xe2\x80\x94Let us hence\xe2\x80\x94let us hence!\xe2\x80\x94Money he\r\nwill lack, for he has just returned from Palestine, and, as they say,\r\nfrom prison\xe2\x80\x94and pretext for exacting it, should he need any, may arise\r\nout of my simple traffic with his brother John. Away, away, let us\r\nhence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists,\r\nand by means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her\r\nsafely to the house of the Rabbi Nathan.\r\n\r\nThe Jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the\r\nday, having now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was\r\ntransferred to the Black Knight. They now filled the air with \xe2\x80\x9cLong\r\nlife to Richard with the Lion\xe2\x80\x99s Heart, and down with the usurping\r\nTemplars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe to the Earl of\r\nEssex, \xe2\x80\x9cit was well the King took the precaution to bring thee with\r\nhim, noble Earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Earl smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGallant Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Essex, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou know our Master so well, and\r\nyet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! I was drawing towards\r\nYork having heard that Prince John was making head there, when I met\r\nKing Richard, like a true knight-errant, galloping hither to achieve in\r\nhis own person this adventure of the Templar and the Jewess, with his\r\nown single arm. I accompanied him with my band, almost maugre his\r\nconsent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what news from York, brave Earl?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cwill the rebels\r\nbide us there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than December\xe2\x80\x99s snow will bide July\xe2\x80\x99s sun,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey are dispersing; and who should come posting to bring us the news,\r\nbut John himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe traitor! the ungrateful insolent traitor!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cdid not\r\nRichard order him into confinement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! he received him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cas if they had met after a\r\nhunting party; and, pointing to me and our men-at-arms, said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou\r\nseest, brother, I have some angry men with me\xe2\x80\x94thou wert best go to our\r\nmother, carry her my duteous affection, and abide with her until men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nminds are pacified.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this was all he said?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cwould not any one say\r\nthat this Prince invites men to treason by his clemency?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cas the man may be said to invite death, who\r\nundertakes to fight a combat, having a dangerous wound unhealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive thee the jest, Lord Earl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ivanhoe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, remember, I\r\nhazarded but my own life\xe2\x80\x94Richard, the welfare of his kingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Essex, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are specially careless of their own\r\nwelfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others\xe2\x80\x94But let us\r\nhaste to the castle, for Richard meditates punishing some of the\r\nsubordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their\r\nprincipal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and\r\nwhich are given at length in the Wardour Manuscript, it appears that\r\nMaurice de Bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of\r\nPhilip of France; while Philip de Malvoisin, and his brother Albert,\r\nthe Preceptor of Templestowe, were executed, although Waldemar\r\nFitzurse, the soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and\r\nPrince John, for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured\r\nby his good-natured brother. No one, however, pitied the fate of the\r\ntwo Malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well\r\ndeserved, by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.\r\n\r\nBriefly after the judicial combat, Cedric the Saxon was summoned to the\r\ncourt of Richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that\r\nhad been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at\r\nYork. Cedric tushed and pshawed more than once at the message\xe2\x80\x94but he\r\nrefused not obedience. In fact, the return of Richard had quenched\r\nevery hope that he had entertained of restoring a Saxon dynasty in\r\nEngland; for, whatever head the Saxons might have made in the event of\r\na civil war, it was plain that nothing could be done under the\r\nundisputed dominion of Richard, popular as he was by his personal good\r\nqualities and military fame, although his administration was wilfully\r\ncareless, now too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.\r\n\r\nBut, moreover, it could not escape even Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s reluctant observation,\r\nthat his project for an absolute union among the Saxons, by the\r\nmarriage of Rowena and Athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the\r\nmutual dissent of both parties concerned. This was, indeed, an event\r\nwhich, in his ardour for the Saxon cause, he could not have\r\nanticipated, and even when the disinclination of both was broadly and\r\nplainly manifested, he could scarce bring himself to believe that two\r\nSaxons of royal descent should scruple, on personal grounds, at an\r\nalliance so necessary for the public weal of the nation. But it was not\r\nthe less certain: Rowena had always expressed her repugnance to\r\nAthelstane, and now Athelstane was no less plain and positive in\r\nproclaiming his resolution never to pursue his addresses to the Lady\r\nRowena. Even the natural obstinacy of Cedric sunk beneath these\r\nobstacles, where he, remaining on the point of junction, had the task\r\nof dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with each hand. He made,\r\nhowever, a last vigorous attack on Athelstane, and he found that\r\nresuscitated sprout of Saxon royalty engaged, like country squires of\r\nour own day, in a furious war with the clergy.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the Abbot of Saint\r\nEdmund\xe2\x80\x99s, Athelstane\xe2\x80\x99s spirit of revenge, what between the natural\r\nindolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of\r\nhis mother Edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the\r\nclerical order, had terminated in his keeping the Abbot and his monks\r\nin the dungeons of Coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. For\r\nthis atrocity the Abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out\r\na dreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach, suffered by\r\nhimself and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust\r\nimprisonment they had sustained. With this controversy, and with the\r\nmeans he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, Cedric\r\nfound the mind of his friend Athelstane so fully occupied, that it had\r\nno room for another idea. And when Rowena\xe2\x80\x99s name was mentioned the\r\nnoble Athelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and\r\nthat she might soon be the bride of his kinsman Wilfred. It was a\r\ndesperate case therefore. There was obviously no more to be made of\r\nAthelstane; or, as Wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended\r\nfrom Saxon times to ours, he was a cock that would not fight.\r\n\r\nThere remained betwixt Cedric and the determination which the lovers\r\ndesired to come to, only two obstacles\xe2\x80\x94his own obstinacy, and his\r\ndislike of the Norman dynasty. The former feeling gradually gave way\r\nbefore the endearments of his ward, and the pride which he could not\r\nhelp nourishing in the fame of his son. Besides, he was not insensible\r\nto the honour of allying his own line to that of Alfred, when the\r\nsuperior claims of the descendant of Edward the Confessor were\r\nabandoned for ever. Cedric\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to the Norman race of kings was\r\nalso much undermined,\xe2\x80\x94first, by consideration of the impossibility of\r\nridding England of the new dynasty, a feeling which goes far to create\r\nloyalty in the subject to the king \xe2\x80\x9cde facto\xe2\x80\x9d; and, secondly, by the\r\npersonal attention of King Richard, who delighted in the blunt humour\r\nof Cedric, and, to use the language of the Wardour Manuscript, so dealt\r\nwith the noble Saxon, that, ere he had been a guest at court for seven\r\ndays, he had given his consent to the marriage of his ward Rowena and\r\nhis son Wilfred of Ivanhoe.\r\n\r\nThe nuptials of our hero, thus formally approved by his father, were\r\ncelebrated in the most august of temples, the noble Minster of York.\r\nThe King himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded\r\non this and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded\r\nSaxons, gave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their\r\njust rights, than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance\r\nof a civil war. The Church gave her full solemnities, graced with all\r\nthe splendour which she of Rome knows how to apply with such brilliant\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nGurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master\r\nwhom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous Wamba, decorated\r\nwith a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. Sharers of\r\nWilfred\xe2\x80\x99s dangers and adversity, they remained, as they had a right to\r\nexpect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.\r\n\r\nBut besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were\r\ncelebrated by the attendance of the high-born Normans, as well as\r\nSaxons, joined with the universal jubilee of the lower orders, that\r\nmarked the marriage of two individuals as a pledge of the future peace\r\nand harmony betwixt two races, which, since that period, have been so\r\ncompletely mingled, that the distinction has become wholly invisible.\r\nCedric lived to see this union approximate towards its completion; for\r\nas the two nations mixed in society and formed intermarriages with each\r\nother, the Normans abated their scorn, and the Saxons were refined from\r\ntheir rusticity. But it was not until the reign of Edward the Third\r\nthat the mixed language, now termed English, was spoken at the court of\r\nLondon, and that the hostile distinction of Norman and Saxon seems\r\nentirely to have disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the second morning after this happy bridal, that the Lady\r\nRowena was made acquainted by her handmaid Elgitha, that a damsel\r\ndesired admission to her presence, and solicited that their parley\r\nmight be without witness. Rowena wondered, hesitated, became curious,\r\nand ended by commanding the damsel to be admitted, and her attendants\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\nShe entered\xe2\x80\x94a noble and commanding figure, the long white veil, in\r\nwhich she was shrouded, overshadowing rather than concealing the\r\nelegance and majesty of her shape. Her demeanour was that of respect,\r\nunmingled by the least shade either of fear, or of a wish to propitiate\r\nfavour. Rowena was ever ready to acknowledge the claims, and attend to\r\nthe feelings, of others. She arose, and would have conducted her lovely\r\nvisitor to a seat; but the stranger looked at Elgitha, and again\r\nintimated a wish to discourse with the Lady Rowena alone. Elgitha had\r\nno sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the\r\nLady of Ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her\r\nhands to her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of\r\nRowena\xe2\x80\x99s resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat means this, lady?\xe2\x80\x9d said the surprised bride; \xe2\x80\x9cor why do you offer\r\nto me a deference so unusual?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause to you, Lady of Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, rising up and resuming\r\nthe usual quiet dignity of her manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI may lawfully, and without\r\nrebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which I owe to Wilfred of Ivanhoe. I\r\nam\xe2\x80\x94forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x94I am the unhappy Jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his\r\nlife against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of Templestowe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamsel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, \xe2\x80\x9cWilfred of Ivanhoe on that day rendered back\r\nbut in slight measure your unceasing charity towards him in his wounds\r\nand misfortunes. Speak, is there aught remains in which he or I can\r\nserve thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you will transmit to him my\r\ngrateful farewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave England then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, scarce recovering the surprise\r\nof this extraordinary visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. My father had a brother\r\nhigh in favour with Mohammed Boabdil, King of Grenada\xe2\x80\x94thither we go,\r\nsecure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the\r\nMoslem exact from our people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you not then as well protected in England?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nhusband has favour with the King\xe2\x80\x94the King himself is just and\r\ngenerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it not\xe2\x80\x94but the people of England are a\r\nfierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among\r\nthemselves, and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each\r\nother. Such is no safe abode for the children of my people. Ephraim is\r\nan heartless dove\xe2\x80\x94Issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops\r\nbetween two burdens. Not in a land of war and blood, surrounded by\r\nhostile neighbours, and distracted by internal factions, can Israel\r\nhope to rest during her wanderings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you, maiden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou surely can have nothing to fear.\r\nShe who nursed the sick-bed of Ivanhoe,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, rising with\r\nenthusiasm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cshe can have nothing to fear in England, where Saxon and\r\nNorman will contend who shall most do her honour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy speech is fair, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rebecca, \xe2\x80\x9cand thy purpose fairer; but\r\nit may not be\xe2\x80\x94there is a gulf betwixt us. Our breeding, our faith,\r\nalike forbid either to pass over it. Farewell\xe2\x80\x94yet, ere I go indulge me\r\none request. The bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it,\r\nand let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are scarce worthy of being looked upon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena; \xe2\x80\x9cbut,\r\nexpecting the same from my visitant, I remove the veil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousness of\r\nbeauty, partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek,\r\nbrow, neck, and bosom, were suffused with crimson. Rebecca blushed\r\nalso, but it was a momentary feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions,\r\npast slowly from her features like the crimson cloud, which changes\r\ncolour when the sun sinks beneath the horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe countenance you have deigned to show me will\r\nlong dwell in my remembrance. There reigns in it gentleness and\r\ngoodness; and if a tinge of the world\xe2\x80\x99s pride or vanities may mix with\r\nan expression so lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for\r\nbearing some colour of its original? Long, long will I remember your\r\nfeatures, and bless God that I leave my noble deliverer united with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped short\xe2\x80\x94her eyes filled with tears. She hastily wiped them,\r\nand answered to the anxious enquiries of Rowena\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am well, lady\xe2\x80\x94well.\r\nBut my heart swells when I think of Torquilstone and the lists of\r\nTemplestowe.\xe2\x80\x94Farewell. One, the most trifling part of my duty, remains\r\nundischarged. Accept this casket\xe2\x80\x94startle not at its contents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet,\r\nor neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of\r\nimmense value.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, tendering back the casket. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare not\r\naccept a gift of such consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet keep it, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Rebecca.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou have power, rank, command,\r\ninfluence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and\r\nweakness; the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not\r\ninfluence half so much as your slightest wish. To you, therefore, the\r\ngift is of little value,\xe2\x80\x94and to me, what I part with is of much less.\r\nLet me not think you deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your\r\ncommons believe. Think ye that I prize these sparkling fragments of\r\nstone above my liberty? or that my father values them in comparison to\r\nthe honour of his only child? Accept them, lady\xe2\x80\x94to me they are\r\nvalueless. I will never wear jewels more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are then unhappy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rowena, struck with the manner in which\r\nRebecca uttered the last words. \xe2\x80\x9cO, remain with us\xe2\x80\x94the counsel of holy\r\nmen will wean you from your erring law, and I will be a sister to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her\r\nsoft voice and beautiful features\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x94may not be. I may not change\r\nthe faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in which\r\nI seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, I will not be. He, to whom I\r\ndedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if I do His will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nRowena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess; \xe2\x80\x9cbut among our people, since the time of\r\nAbraham downwards, have been women who have devoted their thoughts to\r\nHeaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the\r\nsick, feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. Among these\r\nwill Rebecca be numbered. Say this to thy lord, should he chance to\r\nenquire after the fate of her whose life he saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an involuntary tremour on Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and a tenderness\r\nof accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have\r\nexpressed. She hastened to bid Rowena adieu.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay He, who made both Jew and Christian, shower\r\ndown on you his choicest blessings! The bark that waits us hence will\r\nbe under weigh ere we can reach the port.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glided from the apartment, leaving Rowena surprised as if a vision\r\nhad passed before her. The fair Saxon related the singular conference\r\nto her husband, on whose mind it made a deep impression. He lived long\r\nand happily with Rowena, for they were attached to each other by the\r\nbonds of early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the\r\nrecollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union. Yet it\r\nwould be enquiring too curiously to ask, whether the recollection of\r\nRebecca\xe2\x80\x99s beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more\r\nfrequently than the fair descendant of Alfred might altogether have\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nIvanhoe distinguished himself in the service of Richard, and was graced\r\nwith farther marks of the royal favour. He might have risen still\r\nhigher, but for the premature death of the heroic C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion, before\r\nthe Castle of Chaluz, near Limoges. With the life of a generous, but\r\nrash and romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition\r\nand his generosity had formed; to whom may be applied, with a slight\r\nalteration, the lines composed by Johnson for Charles of Sweden\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHis fate was destined to a foreign strand,\r\nA petty fortress and an \xe2\x80\x9chumble\xe2\x80\x9d hand;\r\nHe left the name at which the world grew pale,\r\nTo point a moral, or adorn a TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote A.\xe2\x80\x94The Ranger or the Forest, that cuts the foreclaws off our dogs.\r\n\r\nA most sensible grievance of those aggrieved times were the Forest\r\nLaws. These oppressive enactments were the produce of the Norman\r\nConquest, for the Saxon laws of the chase were mild and humane; while\r\nthose of William, enthusiastically attached to the exercise and its\r\nrights, were to the last degree tyrannical. The formation of the New\r\nForest, bears evidence to his passion for hunting, where he reduced\r\nmany a happy village to the condition of that one commemorated by my\r\nfriend, Mr William Stewart Rose:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmongst the ruins of the church\r\nThe midnight raven found a perch,\r\nA melancholy place;\r\nThe ruthless Conqueror cast down,\r\nWoe worth the deed, that little town,\r\nTo lengthen out his chase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disabling dogs, which might be necessary for keeping flocks and\r\nherds, from running at the deer, was called \xe2\x80\x9clawing\xe2\x80\x9d, and was in\r\ngeneral use. The Charter of the Forest designed to lessen those evils,\r\ndeclares that inquisition, or view, for lawing dogs, shall be made\r\nevery third year, and shall be then done by the view and testimony of\r\nlawful men, not otherwise; and they whose dogs shall be then found\r\nunlawed, shall give three shillings for mercy, and for the future no\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s ox shall be taken for lawing. Such lawing also shall be done by\r\nthe assize commonly used, and which is, that three claws shall be cut\r\noff without the ball of the right foot. See on this subject the\r\nHistorical Essay on the Magna Charta of King John, (a most beautiful\r\nvolume), by Richard Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote B.\xe2\x80\x94Negro Slaves.\r\n\r\nThe severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of\r\nthe slaves of Brian de Bois-Guilbert, as being totally out of costume\r\nand propriety. I remember the same objection being made to a set of\r\nsable functionaries, whom my friend, Mat Lewis, introduced as the\r\nguards and mischief-doing satellites of the wicked Baron, in his Castle\r\nSpectre. Mat treated the objection with great contempt, and averred in\r\nreply, that he made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking\r\neffect of contrast, and that, could he have derived a similar advantage\r\nfrom making his heroine blue, blue she should have been.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to plead the immunities of my order so highly as this;\r\nbut neither will I allow that the author of a modern antique romance is\r\nobliged to confine himself to the introduction of those manners only\r\nwhich can be proved to have absolutely existed in the times he is\r\ndepicting, so that he restrain himself to such as are plausible and\r\nnatural, and contain no obvious anachronism. In this point of view,\r\nwhat can be more natural, than that the Templars, who, we know, copied\r\nclosely the luxuries of the Asiatic warriors with whom they fought,\r\nshould use the service of the enslaved Africans, whom the fate of war\r\ntransferred to new masters? I am sure, if there are no precise proofs\r\nof their having done so, there is nothing, on the other hand, that can\r\nentitle us positively to conclude that they never did. Besides, there\r\nis an instance in romance.\r\n\r\nJohn of Rampayne, an excellent juggler and minstrel, undertook to\r\neffect the escape of one Audulf de Bracy, by presenting himself in\r\ndisguise at the court of the king, where he was confined. For this\r\npurpose, \xe2\x80\x9che stained his hair and his whole body entirely as black as\r\njet, so that nothing was white but his teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d and succeeded in\r\nimposing himself on the king, as an Ethiopian minstrel. He effected, by\r\nstratagem, the escape of the prisoner. Negroes, therefore, must have\r\nbeen known in England in the dark ages. 60\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote C.\xe2\x80\x94Minstrelsy.\r\n\r\nThe realm of France, it is well known, was divided betwixt the Norman\r\nand Teutonic race, who spoke the language in which the word Yes is\r\npronounced as \xe2\x80\x9coui\xe2\x80\x9d, and the inhabitants of the southern regions, whose\r\nspeech bearing some affinity to the Italian, pronounced the same word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9coc\xe2\x80\x9d. The poets of the former race were called \xe2\x80\x9cMinstrels\xe2\x80\x9d, and their\r\npoems \xe2\x80\x9cLays\xe2\x80\x9d: those of the latter were termed \xe2\x80\x9cTroubadours\xe2\x80\x9d, and their\r\ncompositions called \xe2\x80\x9csirventes\xe2\x80\x9d, and other names. Richard, a professed\r\nadmirer of the joyous science in all its branches, could imitate either\r\nthe minstrel or troubadour. It is less likely that he should have been\r\nable to compose or sing an English ballad; yet so much do we wish to\r\nassimilate Him of the Lion Heart to the band of warriors whom he led,\r\nthat the anachronism, if there be one may readily be forgiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote D.\xe2\x80\x94Battle of Stamford.\r\n\r\nA great topographical blunder occurred here in former editions. The\r\nbloody battle alluded to in the text, fought and won by King Harold,\r\nover his brother the rebellious Tosti, and an auxiliary force of Danes\r\nor Norsemen, was said, in the text, and a corresponding note, to have\r\ntaken place at Stamford, in Leicestershire, and upon the river Welland.\r\nThis is a mistake, into which the author has been led by trusting to\r\nhis memory, and so confounding two places of the same name. The\r\nStamford, Strangford, or Staneford, at which the battle really was\r\nfought, is a ford upon the river Derwent, at the distance of about\r\nseven miles from York, and situated in that large and opulent county. A\r\nlong wooden bridge over the Derwent, the site of which, with one\r\nremaining buttress, is still shown to the curious traveller, was\r\nfuriously contested. One Norwegian long defended it by his single arm,\r\nand was at length pierced with a spear thrust through the planks of the\r\nbridge from a boat beneath.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Stamford, on the Derwent, contains some memorials\r\nof the battle. Horseshoes, swords, and the heads of halberds, or bills,\r\nare often found there; one place is called the \xe2\x80\x9cDanes\xe2\x80\x99 well,\xe2\x80\x9d another\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBattle flats.\xe2\x80\x9d From a tradition that the weapon with which the\r\nNorwegian champion was slain, resembled a pear, or, as others say, that\r\nthe trough or boat in which the soldier floated under the bridge to\r\nstrike the blow, had such a shape, the country people usually begin a\r\ngreat market, which is held at Stamford, with an entertainment called\r\nthe Pear-pie feast, which after all may be a corruption of the\r\nSpear-pie feast. For more particulars, Drake\xe2\x80\x99s History of York may be\r\nreferred to. The author\xe2\x80\x99s mistake was pointed out to him, in the most\r\nobliging manner, by Robert Belt, Esq. of Bossal House. The battle was\r\nfought in 1066.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote E.\xe2\x80\x94The range of iron bars above that glowing charcoal.\r\n\r\nThis horrid species of torture may remind the reader of that to which\r\nthe Spaniards subjected Guatimozin, in order to extort a discovery of\r\nhis concealed wealth. But, in fact, an instance of similar barbarity is\r\nto be found nearer home, and occurs in the annals of Queen Mary\xe2\x80\x99s time,\r\ncontaining so many other examples of atrocity. Every reader must\r\nrecollect, that after the fall of the Catholic Church, and the\r\nPresbyterian Church Government had been established by law, the rank,\r\nand especially the wealth, of the Bishops, Abbots, Priors, and so\r\nforth, were no longer vested in ecclesiastics, but in lay impropriators\r\nof the church revenues, or, as the Scottish lawyers called them,\r\ntitulars of the temporalities of the benefice, though having no claim\r\nto the spiritual character of their predecessors in office.\r\n\r\nOf these laymen, who were thus invested with ecclesiastical revenues,\r\nsome were men of high birth and rank, like the famous Lord James\r\nStewart, the Prior of St Andrews, who did not fail to keep for their\r\nown use the rents, lands, and revenues of the church. But if, on the\r\nother hand, the titulars were men of inferior importance, who had been\r\ninducted into the office by the interest of some powerful person, it\r\nwas generally understood that the new Abbot should grant for his\r\npatron\xe2\x80\x99s benefit such leases and conveyances of the church lands and\r\ntithes as might afford their protector the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the booty.\r\nThis was the origin of those who were wittily termed Tulchan 61\r\n\r\nBishops, being a sort of imaginary prelate, whose image was set up to\r\nenable his patron and principal to plunder the benefice under his name.\r\n\r\nThere were other cases, however, in which men who had got grants of\r\nthese secularised benefices, were desirous of retaining them for their\r\nown use, without having the influence sufficient to establish their\r\npurpose; and these became frequently unable to protect themselves,\r\nhowever unwilling to submit to the exactions of the feudal tyrant of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nBannatyne, secretary to John Knox, recounts a singular course of\r\noppression practised on one of those titulars abbots, by the Earl of\r\nCassilis in Ayrshire, whose extent of feudal influence was so wide that\r\nhe was usually termed the King of Carrick. We give the fact as it\r\noccurs in Bannatyne\xe2\x80\x99s Journal, only premising that the Journalist held\r\nhis master\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, both with respect to the Earl of Cassilis as an\r\nopposer of the king\xe2\x80\x99s party, and as being a detester of the practice of\r\ngranting church revenues to titulars, instead of their being devoted to\r\npious uses, such as the support of the clergy, expense of schools, and\r\nthe relief of the national poor. He mingles in the narrative,\r\ntherefore, a well deserved feeling of execration against the tyrant who\r\nemployed the torture, which a tone of ridicule towards the patient, as\r\nif, after all, it had not been ill bestowed on such an equivocal and\r\namphibious character as a titular abbot. He entitles his narrative,\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF CASSILIS\xe2\x80\x99 TYRANNY AGAINST A QUICK (i.e. LIVING) MAN.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Allan Stewart, friend to Captain James Stewart of Cardonall, by\r\nmeans of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s corrupted court, obtained the Abbey of\r\nCrossraguel. The said Earl thinking himself greater than any king in\r\nthose quarters, determined to have that whole benefice (as he hath\r\ndivers others) to pay at his pleasure; and because he could not find\r\nsic security as his insatiable appetite required, this shift was\r\ndevised. The said Mr Allan being in company with the Laird of Bargany,\r\n(also a Kennedy,) was, by the Earl and his friends, enticed to leave\r\nthe safeguard which he had with the Laird, and come to make good cheer\r\nwith the said Earl. The simplicity of the imprudent man was suddenly\r\nabused; and so he passed his time with them certain days, which he did\r\nin Maybole with Thomas Kennedie, uncle to the said Earl; after which\r\nthe said Mr Allan passed, with quiet company, to visit the place and\r\nbounds of Crossraguel, [his abbacy,] of which the said Earl being\r\nsurely advertised, determined to put in practice the tyranny which long\r\nbefore he had conceived. And so, as king of the country, apprehended\r\nthe said Mr Allan, and carried him to the house of Denure, where for a\r\nseason he was honourably treated, (if a prisoner can think any\r\nentertainment pleasing;) but after that certain days were spent, and\r\nthat the Earl could not obtain the feus of Crossraguel according to his\r\nown appetite, he determined to prove if a collation could work that\r\nwhich neither dinner nor supper could do for a long time. And so the\r\nsaid Mr Allan was carried to a secret chamber: with him passed the\r\nhonourable Earl, his worshipful brother, and such as were appointed to\r\nbe servants at that banquet. In the chamber there was a grit iron\r\nchimlay, under it a fire; other grit provision was not seen. The first\r\ncourse was,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98My Lord Abbot,\xe2\x80\x99 (said the Earl,) \xe2\x80\x98it will please you\r\nconfess here, that with your own consent you remain in my company,\r\nbecause ye durst not commit yourself to the hands of others.\xe2\x80\x99 The Abbot\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x98Would you, my lord, that I should make a manifest lie for\r\nyour pleasure? The truth is, my lord, it is against my will that I am\r\nhere; neither yet have I any pleasure in your company.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But ye shall\r\nremain with me, nevertheless, at this time,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Earl. \xe2\x80\x98I am not\r\nable to resist your will and pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Abbot, \xe2\x80\x98in this\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ye must then obey me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Earl,\xe2\x80\x94and with that were\r\npresented unto him certain letters to subscribe, amongst which there\r\nwas a five years\xe2\x80\x99 tack, and a nineteen years\xe2\x80\x99 tack, and a charter of\r\nfeu of all the lands (of Crossraguel), with all the clauses necessary\r\nfor the Earl to haste him to hell. For if adultery, sacrilege,\r\noppression, barbarous cruelty, and theft heaped upon theft, deserve\r\nhell, the great King of Carrick can no more escape hell for ever, than\r\nthe imprudent Abbot escaped the fire for a season as follows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that the Earl spied repugnance, and saw that he could not come\r\nto his purpose by fair means, he commanded his cooks to prepare the\r\nbanquet: and so first they flayed the sheep, that is, they took off the\r\nAbbot\xe2\x80\x99s cloathes even to his skin, and next they bound him to the\r\nchimney\xe2\x80\x94his legs to the one end, and his arms to the other; and so they\r\nbegan to beet [i.e. feed] the fire sometimes to his buttocks, sometimes\r\nto his legs, sometimes to his shoulders and arms; and that the roast\r\nmight not burn, but that it might rest in soppe, they spared not\r\nflambing with oil, (basting as a cook bastes roasted meat); Lord, look\r\nthou to sic cruelty! And that the crying of the miserable man should\r\nnot be heard, they dosed his mouth that the voice might be stopped. It\r\nmay be suspected that some partisan of the King\xe2\x80\x99s [Darnley\xe2\x80\x99s] murder\r\nwas there. In that torment they held the poor man, till that often he\r\ncried for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake to dispatch him; for he had as meikle gold in his\r\nawin purse as would buy powder enough to shorten his pain. The famous\r\nKing of Carrick and his cooks perceiving the roast to be aneuch,\r\ncommanded it to be tane fra the fire, and the Earl himself began the\r\ngrace in this manner:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Benedicite, Jesus Maria, you are the most\r\nobstinate man that ever I saw; gif I had known that ye had been so\r\nstubborn, I would not for a thousand crowns have handled you so; I\r\nnever did so to man before you.\xe2\x80\x99 And yet he returned to the same\r\npractice within two days, and ceased not till that he obtained his\r\nformost purpose, that is, that he had got all his pieces subscryvit\r\nalsweill as ane half-roasted hand could do it. The Earl thinking\r\nhimself sure enough so long as he had the half-roasted Abbot in his own\r\nkeeping, and yet being ashamed of his presence by reason of his former\r\ncruelty, left the place of Denure in the hands of certain of his\r\nservants, and the half-roasted Abbot to be kept there as prisoner. The\r\nLaird of Bargany, out of whose company the said Abbot had been enticed,\r\nunderstanding, (not the extremity,) but the retaining of the man, sent\r\nto the court, and raised letters of deliverance of the person of the\r\nman according to the order, which being disobeyed, the said Earl for\r\nhis contempt was denounced rebel, and put to the horne. But yet hope\r\nwas there none, neither to the afflicted to be delivered, neither yet\r\nto the purchaser [i.e. procurer] of the letters to obtain any comfort\r\nthereby; for in that time God was despised, and the lawful authority\r\nwas contemned in Scotland, in hope of the sudden return and regiment of\r\nthat cruel murderer of her awin husband, of whose lords the said Earl\r\nwas called one; and yet, oftener than once, he was solemnly sworn to\r\nthe King and to his Regent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Journalist then recites the complaint of the injured Allan Stewart,\r\nCommendator of Crossraguel, to the Regent and Privy Council, averring\r\nhis having been carried, partly by flattery, partly by force, to the\r\nblack vault of Denure, a strong fortalice, built on a rock overhanging\r\nthe Irish channel, where to execute leases and conveyances of the whole\r\nchurches and parsonages belonging to the Abbey of Crossraguel, which he\r\nutterly refused as an unreasonable demand, and the more so that he had\r\nalready conveyed them to John Stewart of Cardonah, by whose interest he\r\nhad been made Commendator. The complainant proceeds to state, that he\r\nwas, after many menaces, stript, bound, and his limbs exposed to fire\r\nin the manner already described, till, compelled by excess of agony, he\r\nsubscribed the charter and leases presented to him, of the contents of\r\nwhich he was totally ignorant. A few days afterwards, being again\r\nrequired to execute a ratification of these deeds before a notary and\r\nwitnesses, and refusing to do so, he was once more subjected to the\r\nsame torture, until his agony was so excessive that he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cFye\r\non you, why do you not strike your whingers into me, or blow me up with\r\na barrel of powder, rather than torture me thus unmercifully?\xe2\x80\x9d upon\r\nwhich the Earl commanded Alexander Richard, one of his attendants, to\r\nstop the patient\xe2\x80\x99s mouth with a napkin, which was done accordingly.\r\nThus he was once more compelled to submit to their tyranny. The\r\npetition concluded with stating, that the Earl, under pretence of the\r\ndeeds thus iniquitously obtained, had taken possession of the whole\r\nplace and living of Crossraguel, and enjoyed the profits thereof for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nThe doom of the Regent and Council shows singularly the total\r\ninterruption of justice at this calamitous period, even in the most\r\nclamant cases of oppression. The Council declined interference with the\r\ncourse of the ordinary justice of the county, (which was completely\r\nunder the said Earl of Cassilis\xe2\x80\x99 control,) and only enacted, that he\r\nshould forbear molestation of the unfortunate Comendator, under the\r\nsurety of two thousand pounds Scots. The Earl was appointed also to\r\nkeep the peace towards the celebrated George Buchanan, who had a\r\npension out of the same Abbacy, to a similar extent, and under the like\r\npenalty.\r\n\r\nThe consequences are thus described by the Journalist already quoted.\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe said Laird of Bargany perceiving that the ordiner justice could\r\nneither help the oppressed, nor yet the afflicted, applied his mind to\r\nthe next remedy, and in the end, by his servants, took the house of\r\nDenure, where the poor Abbot was kept prisoner. The bruit flew fra\r\nCarrick to Galloway, and so suddenly assembled herd and hyre-man that\r\npertained to the band of the Kennedies; and so within a few hours was\r\nthe house of Denure environed again. The master of Cassilis was the\r\nfrackast [i.e. the readiest or boldest] and would not stay, but in his\r\nheat would lay fire to the dungeon, with no small boasting that all\r\nenemies within the house should die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was required and admonished by those that were within to be more\r\nmoderate, and not to hazard himself so foolishly. But no admonition\r\nwould help, till that the wind of an hacquebute blasted his shoulder,\r\nand then ceased he from further pursuit in fury. The Laird of Bargany\r\nhad before purchest [obtained] of the authorities, letters, charging\r\nall faithfull subjects to the King\xe2\x80\x99s Majesty, to assist him against\r\nthat cruel tyrant and mansworn traitor, the Earl of Cassilis; which\r\nletters, with his private writings, he published, and shortly found sic\r\nconcurrence of Kyle and Cunynghame with his other friends, that the\r\nCarrick company drew back fra the house: and so the other approached,\r\nfurnished the house with more men, delivered the said Mr Allan, and\r\ncarried him to Ayr, where, publicly at the market cross of the said\r\ntown, he declared how cruelly he was entreated, and how the murdered\r\nKing suffered not sic torment as he did, excepting only he escaped the\r\ndeath: and, therefore, publickly did revoke all things that were done\r\nin that extremity, and especially revoked the subscription of the three\r\nwritings, to wit, of a fyve yeir tack and nineteen year tack, and of a\r\ncharter of feu. And so the house remained, and remains (till this day,\r\nthe 7th of February, 1571,) in the custody of the said Laird of Bargany\r\nand of his servants. And so cruelty was disappointed of proffeit\r\npresent, and shall be eternallie punished, unless he earnestly repent.\r\nAnd this far for the cruelty committed, to give occasion unto others,\r\nand to such as hate the monstrous dealing of degenerate nobility, to\r\nlook more diligently upon their behaviuours, and to paint them forth\r\nunto the world, that they themselves may be ashamed of their own\r\nbeastliness, and that the world may be advertised and admonished to\r\nabhor, detest, and avoid the company of all sic tyrants, who are not\r\nworthy of the society of men, but ought to be sent suddenly to the\r\ndevil, with whom they must burn without end, for their contempt of God,\r\nand cruelty committed against his creatures. Let Cassilis and his\r\nbrother be the first to be the example unto others. Amen. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d 62\r\n\r\nThis extract has been somewhat amended or modernized in orthography, to\r\nrender it more intelligible to the general reader. I have to add, that\r\nthe Kennedies of Bargany, who interfered in behalf of the oppressed\r\nAbbot, were themselves a younger branch of the Cassilis family, but\r\nheld different politics, and were powerful enough in this, and other\r\ninstances, to bid them defiance.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate issue of this affair does not appear; but as the house of\r\nCassilis are still in possession of the greater part of the feus and\r\nleases which belonged to Crossraguel Abbey, it is probable the talons\r\nof the King of Carrick were strong enough, in those disorderly times,\r\nto retain the prey which they had so mercilessly fixed upon.\r\n\r\nI may also add, that it appears by some papers in my possession, that\r\nthe officers or Country Keepers on the border, were accustomed to\r\ntorment their prisoners by binding them to the iron bars of their\r\nchimneys, to extort confession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nNote F.\xe2\x80\x94Heraldry\r\n\r\nThe author has been here upbraided with false heraldry, as having\r\ncharged metal upon metal. It should be remembered, however, that\r\nheraldry had only its first rude origin during the crusades, and that\r\nall the minutiae of its fantastic science were the work of time, and\r\nintroduced at a much later period. Those who think otherwise must\r\nsuppose that the Goddess of \xe2\x80\x9cArmoirers\xe2\x80\x9d, like the Goddess of Arms,\r\nsprung into the world completely equipped in all the gaudy trappings of\r\nthe department she presides over.\r\n\r\nAdditional Note\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of said note, it may be observed, that the arms, which\r\nwere assumed by Godfrey of Boulogne himself, after the conquest of\r\nJerusalem, was a cross counter patent cantoned with four little crosses\r\nor, upon a field azure, displaying thus metal upon metal. The heralds\r\nhave tried to explain this undeniable fact in different modes\xe2\x80\x94but Ferne\r\ngallantly contends, that a prince of Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s qualities should not be\r\nbound by the ordinary rules. The Scottish Nisbet, and the same Ferne,\r\ninsist that the chiefs of the Crusade must have assigned to Godfrey\r\nthis extraordinary and unwonted coat-of-arms, in order to induce those\r\nwho should behold them to make enquiries; and hence give them the name\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9carma inquirenda\xe2\x80\x9d. But with reverence to these grave authorities, it\r\nseems unlikely that the assembled princes of Europe should have\r\nadjudged to Godfrey a coat armorial so much contrary to the general\r\nrule, if such rule had then existed; at any rate, it proves that metal\r\nupon metal, now accounted a solecism in heraldry, was admitted in other\r\ncases similar to that in the text.

In the very\r\ncurious romance on the subject of his adventures in the Holy Land, and\r\nhis return from thence, it is recorded how he exchanged a pugilistic\r\nfavour of this nature, while a prisoner in Germany. His opponent was\r\nthe son of his principal warder, and was so imprudent as to give the\r\nchallenge to this barter of buffets. The King stood forth like a true\r\nman, and received a blow which staggered him. In requital, having\r\npreviously waxed his hand, a practice unknown, I believe, to the\r\ngentlemen of the modern fancy, he returned the box on the ear with such\r\ninterest as to kill his antagonist on the spot.\xe2\x80\x94See, in Ellis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSpecimens of English Romance, that of C\xc5\x93ur-de-Lion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNote I.\xe2\x80\x94Hedge-Priests.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, that in every state of society, some sort of\r\nghostly consolation is provided for the members of the community,\r\nthough assembled for purposes diametrically opposite to religion. A\r\ngang of beggars have their Patrico, and the banditti of the Apennines\r\nhave among them persons acting as monks and priests, by whom they are\r\nconfessed, and who perform mass before them. Unquestionably, such\r\nreverend persons, in such a society, must accommodate their manners and\r\ntheir morals to the community in which they live; and if they can\r\noccasionally obtain a degree of reverence for their supposed spiritual\r\ngifts, are, on most occasions, loaded with unmerciful ridicule, as\r\npossessing a character inconsistent with all around them.\r\n\r\nHence the fighting parson in the old play of Sir John Oldcastle, and\r\nthe famous friar of Robin Hood\xe2\x80\x99s band. Nor were such characters ideal.\r\nThere exists a monition of the Bishop of Durham against irregular\r\nchurchmen of this class, who associated themselves with Border robbers,\r\nand desecrated the holiest offices of the priestly function, by\r\ncelebrating them for the benefit of thieves, robbers, and murderers,\r\namongst ruins and in caverns of the earth, without regard to canonical\r\nform, and with torn and dirty attire, and maimed rites, altogether\r\nimproper for the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote J.\xe2\x80\x94Castle of Coningsburgh.\r\n\r\nWhen I last saw this interesting ruin of ancient days, one of the very\r\nfew remaining examples of Saxon fortification, I was strongly impressed\r\nwith the desire of tracing out a sort of theory on the subject, which,\r\nfrom some recent acquaintance with the architecture of the ancient\r\nScandinavians, seemed to me peculiarly interesting. I was, however,\r\nobliged by circumstances to proceed on my journey, without leisure to\r\ntake more than a transient view of Coningsburgh. Yet the idea dwells so\r\nstrongly in my mind, that I feel considerably tempted to write a page\r\nor two in detailing at least the outline of my hypothesis, leaving\r\nbetter antiquaries to correct or refute conclusions which are perhaps\r\ntoo hastily drawn.\r\n\r\nThose who have visited the Zetland Islands, are familiar with the\r\ndescription of castles called by the inhabitants Burghs; and by the\r\nHighlanders\xe2\x80\x94for they are also to be found both in the Western Isles and\r\non the mainland\xe2\x80\x94Duns. Pennant has engraved a view of the famous\r\nDun-Dornadilla in Glenelg; and there are many others, all of them built\r\nafter a peculiar mode of architecture, which argues a people in the\r\nmost primitive state of society. The most perfect specimen is that upon\r\nthe island of Mousa, near to the mainland of Zetland, which is probably\r\nin the same state as when inhabited.\r\n\r\nIt is a single round tower, the wall curving in slightly, and then\r\nturning outward again in the form of a dice-box, so that the defenders\r\non the top might the better protect the base. It is formed of rough\r\nstones, selected with care, and laid in courses or circles, with much\r\ncompactness, but without cement of any kind. The tower has never, to\r\nappearance, had roofing of any sort; a fire was made in the centre of\r\nthe space which it encloses, and originally the building was probably\r\nlittle more than a wall drawn as a sort of screen around the great\r\ncouncil fire of the tribe. But, although the means or ingenuity of the\r\nbuilders did not extend so far as to provide a roof, they supplied the\r\nwant by constructing apartments in the interior of the walls of the\r\ntower itself. The circumvallation formed a double enclosure, the inner\r\nside of which was, in fact, two feet or three feet distant from the\r\nother, and connected by a concentric range of long flat stones, thus\r\nforming a series of concentric rings or stories of various heights,\r\nrising to the top of the tower. Each of these stories or galleries has\r\nfour windows, facing directly to the points of the compass, and rising\r\nof course regularly above each other. These four perpendicular ranges\r\nof windows admitted air, and, the fire being kindled, heat, or smoke at\r\nleast, to each of the galleries. The access from gallery to gallery is\r\nequally primitive. A path, on the principle of an inclined plane, turns\r\nround and round the building like a screw, and gives access to the\r\ndifferent stories, intersecting each of them in its turn, and thus\r\ngradually rising to the top of the wall of the tower. On the outside\r\nthere are no windows; and I may add, that an enclosure of a square, or\r\nsometimes a round form, gave the inhabitants of the Burgh an\r\nopportunity to secure any sheep or cattle which they might possess.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general architecture of that very early period when the\r\nNorthmen swept the seas, and brought to their rude houses, such as I\r\nhave described them, the plunder of polished nations. In Zetland there\r\nare several scores of these Burghs, occupying in every case, capes,\r\nheadlands, islets, and similar places of advantage singularly well\r\nchosen. I remember the remains of one upon an island in a small lake\r\nnear Lerwick, which at high tide communicates with the sea, the access\r\nto which is very ingenious, by means of a causeway or dike, about three\r\nor four inches under the surface of the water. This causeway makes a\r\nsharp angle in its approach to the Burgh. The inhabitants, doubtless,\r\nwere well acquainted with this, but strangers, who might approach in a\r\nhostile manner, and were ignorant of the curve of the causeway, would\r\nprobably plunge into the lake, which is six or seven feet in depth at\r\nthe least. This must have been the device of some Vauban or Cohorn of\r\nthose early times.\r\n\r\nThe style of these buildings evinces that the architect possessed\r\nneither the art of using lime or cement of any kind, nor the skill to\r\nthrow an arch, construct a roof, or erect a stair; and yet, with all\r\nthis ignorance, showed great ingenuity in selecting the situation of\r\nBurghs, and regulating the access to them, as well as neatness and\r\nregularity in the erection, since the buildings themselves show a style\r\nof advance in the arts scarcely consistent with the ignorance of so\r\nmany of the principal branches of architectural knowledge.\r\n\r\nI have always thought, that one of the most curious and valuable\r\nobjects of antiquaries has been to trace the progress of society, by\r\nthe efforts made in early ages to improve the rudeness of their first\r\nexpedients, until they either approach excellence, or, as is more\r\nfrequently the case, are supplied by new and fundamental discoveries,\r\nwhich supersede both the earlier and ruder system, and the improvements\r\nwhich have been ingrafted upon it. For example, if we conceive the\r\nrecent discovery of gas to be so much improved and adapted to domestic\r\nuse, as to supersede all other modes of producing domestic light; we\r\ncan already suppose, some centuries afterwards, the heads of a whole\r\nSociety of Antiquaries half turned by the discovery of a pair of patent\r\nsnuffers, and by the learned theories which would be brought forward to\r\naccount for the form and purpose of so singular an implement.\r\n\r\nFollowing some such principle, I am inclined to regard the singular\r\nCastle of Coningsburgh\xe2\x80\x94I mean the Saxon part of it\xe2\x80\x94as a step in advance\r\nfrom the rude architecture, if it deserves the name, which must have\r\nbeen common to the Saxons as to other Northmen. The builders had\r\nattained the art of using cement, and of roofing a building,\xe2\x80\x94great\r\nimprovements on the original Burgh. But in the round keep, a shape only\r\nseen in the most ancient castles\xe2\x80\x94the chambers excavated in the\r\nthickness of the walls and buttresses\xe2\x80\x94the difficulty by which access is\r\ngained from one story to those above it, Coningsburgh still retains the\r\nsimplicity of its origin, and shows by what slow degrees man proceeded\r\nfrom occupying such rude and inconvenient lodgings, as were afforded by\r\nthe galleries of the Castle of Mousa, to the more splendid\r\naccommodations of the Norman castles, with all their stern and Gothic\r\ngraces.\r\n\r\nI am ignorant if these remarks are new, or if they will be confirmed by\r\ncloser examination; but I think, that, on a hasty observation,\r\nConingsburgh offers means of curious study to those who may wish to\r\ntrace the history of architecture back to the times preceding the\r\nNorman Conquest.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly desirable that a cork model should be taken of the\r\nCastle of Mousa, as it cannot be well understood by a plan.\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Coningsburgh is thus described:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe castle is large, the outer walls standing on a pleasant ascent\r\nfrom the river, but much overtopt by a high hill, on which the town\r\nstands, situated at the head of a rich and magnificent vale, formed by\r\nan amphitheatre of woody hills, in which flows the gentle Don. Near the\r\ncastle is a barrow, said to be Hengist\xe2\x80\x99s tomb. The entrance is flanked\r\nto the left by a round tower, with a sloping base, and there are\r\nseveral similar in the outer wall the entrance has piers of a gate, and\r\non the east side the ditch and bank are double and very steep. On the\r\ntop of the churchyard wall is a tombstone, on which are cut in high\r\nrelief, two ravens, or such-like birds. On the south side of the\r\nchurchyard lies an ancient stone, ridged like a coffin, on which is\r\ncarved a man on horseback; and another man with a shield encountering a\r\nvast winged serpent, and a man bearing a shield behind him. It was\r\nprobably one of the rude crosses not uncommon in churchyards in this\r\ncounty. See it engraved on the plate of crosses for this volume, plate\r\n14. fig. 1. The name of Coningsburgh, by which this castle goes in the\r\nold editions of the Britannia, would lead one to suppose it the\r\nresidence of the Saxon kings. It afterwards belonged to King Harold.\r\nThe Conqueror bestowed it on William de Warren, with all its privileges\r\nand jurisdiction, which are said to have extended over twenty-eight\r\ntowns. At the corner of the area, which is of an irregular form, stands\r\nthe great tower, or keep, placed on a small hill of its own dimensions,\r\non which lies six vast projecting buttresses, ascending in a steep\r\ndirection to prop and support the building, and continued upwards up\r\nthe side as turrets. The tower within forms a complete circle,\r\ntwenty-one feet in diameter, the walls fourteen feet thick. The ascent\r\ninto the tower is by an exceeding deep flight of steep steps, four feet\r\nand a half wide, on the south side leading to a low doorway, over which\r\nis a circular arch crossed by a great transom stone. Within this door\r\nis the staircase which ascends straight through the thickness of the\r\nwall, not communicating with the room on the first floor, in whose\r\ncentre is the opening to the dungeon. Neither of these lower rooms is\r\nlighted except from a hole in the floor of the third story; the room in\r\nwhich, as well as in that above it, is finished with compact smooth\r\nstonework, both having chimney-pieces, with an arch resting on triple\r\nclustered pillars. In the third story, or guard-chamber, is a small\r\nrecess with a loop-hole, probably a bedchamber, and in that floor above\r\na niche for a saint or holy-water pot. Mr. King imagines this a Saxon\r\ncastle of the first ages of the Heptarchy. Mr. Watson thus describes\r\nit. From the first floor to the second story, (third from the ground,)\r\nis a way by a stair in the wall five feet wide. The next staircase is\r\napproached by a ladder, and ends at the fourth story from the ground.\r\nTwo yards from the door, at the head of this stair, is an opening\r\nnearly east, accessible by treading on the ledge of the wall, which\r\ndiminishes eight inches each story; and this last opening leads into a\r\nroom or chapel ten feet by twelve, and fifteen or sixteen high, arched\r\nwith free-stone, and supported by small circular columns of the same,\r\nthe capitals and arches Saxon. It has an east window, and on each side\r\nin the wall, about four feet from the ground, a stone basin with a hole\r\nand iron pipe to convey the water into or through the wall. This chapel\r\nis one of the buttresses, but no sign of it without, for even the\r\nwindow, though large within, is only a long narrow loop-hole, scarcely\r\nto be seen without. On the left side of this chapel is a small oratory,\r\neight by six in the thickness of the wall, with a niche in the wall,\r\nand enlightened by a like loop-hole. The fourth stair from the ground,\r\nten feet west from the chapel door, leads to the top of the tower\r\nthrough the thickness of the wall, which at top is but three yards.\r\nEach story is about fifteen feet high, so that the tower will be\r\nseventy-five feet from the ground. The inside forms a circle, whose\r\ndiameter may be about twelve feet. The well at the bottom of the\r\ndungeon is piled with stones.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Gough\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEdition Of Camden\xe2\x80\x99s Britannia\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\nSecond Edition, vol. iii. p. 267.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return)\r\n[ The motto alludes to the Author returning to the stage repeatedly\r\nafter having taken leave.]\r\n\r\n2 (return)\r\n[ This very curious poem, long a desideratum in Scottish literature,\r\nand given up as irrecoverably lost, was lately brought to light by the\r\nresearches of Dr Irvine of the Advocates\xe2\x80\x99 Library, and has been\r\nreprinted by Mr David Laing, Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\n3 (return)\r\n[ Vol. ii. p. 167.]\r\n\r\n4 (return)\r\n[ Like the Hermit, the Shepherd makes havock amongst the King\xe2\x80\x99s game;\r\nbut by means of a sling, not of a bow; like the Hermit, too, he has his\r\npeculiar phrases of compotation, the sign and countersign being\r\nPasselodion and Berafriend.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
