In the afternoon rush of the Grand\r\nCentral Station his eyes had been refreshed by the sight of Miss\r\nLily Bart.\r\n\r\nIt was a Monday in early September, and he was returning to his\r\nwork from a hurried dip into the country; but what was Miss Bart\r\ndoing in town at that season? If she had appeared to be catching a\r\ntrain, he might have inferred that he had come on her in the act\r\nof transition between one and another of the country houses which\r\ndisputed her presence after the close of the Newport season; but\r\nher desultory air perplexed him. She stood apart from the crowd,\r\nletting it drift by her to the platform or the street, and wearing\r\nan air of irresolution which might, as he surmised, be the mask of\r\na very definite purpose. It struck him at once that she was waiting\r\nfor some one, but he hardly knew why the idea arrested him. There\r\nwas nothing new about Lily Bart, yet he could never see her without\r\na faint movement of interest: it was characteristic of her that she\r\nalways roused speculation, that her simplest acts seemed the result\r\nof far-reaching intentions.\r\n\r\nAn impulse of curiosity made him turn out of his direct line to the\r\ndoor, and stroll past her. He knew that if she did not wish to be\r\nseen she would contrive to elude him; and it amused him to think of\r\nputting her skill to the test.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Selden\xe2\x80\x94what good luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came forward smiling, eager almost, in her resolve to intercept\r\nhim. One or two persons, in brushing past them, lingered to look;\r\nfor Miss Bart was a figure to arrest even the suburban traveller\r\nrushing to his last train.\r\n\r\nSelden had never seen her more radiant. Her vivid head, relieved\r\nagainst the dull tints of the crowd, made her more conspicuous than\r\nin a ball-room, and under her dark hat and veil she regained the\r\ngirlish smoothness, the purity of tint, that she was beginning to\r\nlose after eleven years of late hours and indefatigable dancing.\r\nWas it really eleven years, Selden found himself wondering, and had\r\nshe indeed reached the nine-and-twentieth birthday with which her\r\nrivals credited her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat luck!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHow nice of you to come to my rescue!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe responded joyfully that to do so was his mission in life, and\r\nasked what form the rescue was to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, almost any\xe2\x80\x94even to sitting on a bench and talking to me. One\r\nsits out a cotillion\xe2\x80\x94why not sit out a train? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit hotter\r\nhere than in Mrs. Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s conservatory\xe2\x80\x94and some of the women\r\nare not a bit uglier.\xe2\x80\x9d She broke off, laughing, to explain that she\r\nhad come up to town from Tuxedo, on her way to the Gus Trenors\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\nBellomont, and had missed the three-fifteen train to Rhinebeck.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there isn\xe2\x80\x99t another till half-past five.\xe2\x80\x9d She consulted the\r\nlittle jewelled watch among her laces. \xe2\x80\x9cJust two hours to wait. And\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with myself. My maid came up this morning\r\nto do some shopping for me, and was to go on to Bellomont at one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s house is closed, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a soul in\r\ntown.\xe2\x80\x9d She glanced plaintively about the station. \xe2\x80\x9cIt IS hotter\r\nthan Mrs. Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s, after all. If you can spare the time, do\r\ntake me somewhere for a breath of air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe declared himself entirely at her disposal: the adventure struck\r\nhim as diverting. As a spectator, he had always enjoyed Lily Bart;\r\nand his course lay so far out of her orbit that it amused him to\r\nbe drawn for a moment into the sudden intimacy which her proposal\r\nimplied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go over to Sherry\xe2\x80\x99s for a cup of tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled assentingly, and then made a slight grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo many people come up to town on a Monday\xe2\x80\x94one is sure to meet a\r\nlot of bores. I\xe2\x80\x99m as old as the hills, of course, and it ought not\r\nto make any difference; but if I\xe2\x80\x99M old enough, you\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nobjected gaily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m dying for tea\xe2\x80\x94but isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a quieter place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered her smile, which rested on him vividly. Her discretions\r\ninterested him almost as much as her imprudences: he was so sure\r\nthat both were part of the same carefully-elaborated plan. In\r\njudging Miss Bart, he had always made use of the \xe2\x80\x9cargument from\r\ndesign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe resources of New York are rather meagre,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfind a hansom first, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll invent something.\xe2\x80\x9d He led her\r\nthrough the throng of returning holiday-makers, past sallow-faced\r\ngirls in preposterous hats, and flat-chested women struggling with\r\npaper bundles and palm-leaf fans. Was it possible that she belonged\r\nto the same race? The dinginess, the crudity of this average\r\nsection of womanhood made him feel how highly specialized she was.\r\n\r\nA rapid shower had cooled the air, and clouds still hung\r\nrefreshingly over the moist street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delicious! Let us walk a little,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as they emerged\r\nfrom the station.\r\n\r\nThey turned into Madison Avenue and began to stroll northward.\r\nAs she moved beside him, with her long light step, Selden was\r\nconscious of taking a luxurious pleasure in her nearness: in the\r\nmodelling of her little ear, the crisp upward wave of her hair\xe2\x80\x94was\r\nit ever so slightly brightened by art?\xe2\x80\x94and the thick planting\r\nof her straight black lashes. Everything about her was at once\r\nvigorous and exquisite, at once strong and fine. He had a confused\r\nsense that she must have cost a great deal to make, that a great\r\nmany dull and ugly people must, in some mysterious way, have\r\nbeen sacrificed to produce her. He was aware that the qualities\r\ndistinguishing her from the herd of her sex were chiefly external:\r\nas though a fine glaze of beauty and fastidiousness had been\r\napplied to vulgar clay. Yet the analogy left him unsatisfied, for a\r\ncoarse texture will not take a high finish; and was it not possible\r\nthat the material was fine, but that circumstance had fashioned it\r\ninto a futile shape?\r\n\r\nAs he reached this point in his speculations the sun came out, and\r\nher lifted parasol cut off his enjoyment. A moment or two later she\r\npaused with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, I\xe2\x80\x99m so hot and thirsty\xe2\x80\x94and what a hideous place New York\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked despairingly up and down the dreary thoroughfare.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther cities put on their best clothes in summer, but New York\r\nseems to sit in its shirtsleeves.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes wandered down one of\r\nthe side streets. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone has had the humanity to plant a few\r\ntrees over there. Let us go into the shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad my street meets with your approval,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selden as they\r\nturned the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour street? Do you live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced with interest along the new brick and limestone\r\nhouse-fronts, fantastically varied in obedience to the American\r\ncraving for novelty, but fresh and inviting with their awnings and\r\nflower-boxes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes\xe2\x80\x94to be sure: THE BENEDICK. What a nice-looking building!\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen it before.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked across at the\r\nflat-house with its marble porch and pseudo-Georgian facade. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich\r\nare your windows? Those with the awnings down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the top floor\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that nice little balcony is yours? How cool it looks up there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up and see,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cI can give\r\nyou a cup of tea in no time\xe2\x80\x94and you won\xe2\x80\x99t meet any bores.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer colour deepened\xe2\x80\x94she still had the art of blushing at the right\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94but she took the suggestion as lightly as it was made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? It\xe2\x80\x99s too tempting\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the risk,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the same key. In truth, he\r\nhad never liked her as well as at that moment. He knew she had\r\naccepted without afterthought: he could never be a factor in her\r\ncalculations, and there was a surprise, a refreshment almost, in\r\nthe spontaneity of her consent.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold he paused a moment, feeling for his latchkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one here; but I have a servant who is supposed to come\r\nin the mornings, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just possible he may have put out the\r\ntea-things and provided some cake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ushered her into a slip of a hall hung with old prints. She\r\nnoticed the letters and notes heaped on the table among his gloves\r\nand sticks; then she found herself in a small library, dark but\r\ncheerful, with its walls of books, a pleasantly faded Turkey rug,\r\na littered desk and, as he had foretold, a tea-tray on a low table\r\nnear the window. A breeze had sprung up, swaying inward the muslin\r\ncurtains, and bringing a fresh scent of mignonette and petunias\r\nfrom the flower-box on the balcony.\r\n\r\nLily sank with a sigh into one of the shabby leather chairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delicious to have a place like this all to one\xe2\x80\x99s self! What a\r\nmiserable thing it is to be a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned back in a luxury\r\nof discontent.\r\n\r\nSelden was rummaging in a cupboard for the cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven women,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chave been known to enjoy the privileges of\r\na flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, governesses\xe2\x80\x94or widows. But not girls\xe2\x80\x94not poor, miserable,\r\nmarriageable girls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI even know a girl who lives in a flat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat up in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d he assured her, emerging from the cupboard with the\r\nsought-for cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know\xe2\x80\x94you mean Gerty Farish.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled a little unkindly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I said MARRIAGEABLE\xe2\x80\x94and besides, she has a horrid little\r\nplace, and no maid, and such queer things to eat. Her cook does the\r\nwashing and the food tastes of soap. I should hate that, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dine with her on wash-days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selden, cutting\r\nthe cake.\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, and he knelt by the table to light the lamp\r\nunder the kettle, while she measured out the tea into a little\r\ntea-pot of green glaze. As he watched her hand, polished as a\r\nbit of old ivory, with its slender pink nails, and the sapphire\r\nbracelet slipping over her wrist, he was struck with the irony\r\nof suggesting to her such a life as his cousin Gertrude Farish\r\nhad chosen. She was so evidently the victim of the civilization\r\nwhich had produced her, that the links of her bracelet seemed like\r\nmanacles chaining her to her fate.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to read his thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was horrid of me to say that of\r\nGerty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with charming compunction. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot she was your\r\ncousin. But we\xe2\x80\x99re so different, you know: she likes being good,\r\nand I like being happy. And besides, she is free and I am not. If\r\nI were, I daresay I could manage to be happy even in her flat. It\r\nmust be pure bliss to arrange the furniture just as one likes, and\r\ngive all the horrors to the ash-man. If I could only do over my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room I know I should be a better woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so very bad?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked sympathetically.\r\n\r\nShe smiled at him across the tea-pot which she was holding up to be\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat shows how seldom you come there. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come oftener?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I do come, it\xe2\x80\x99s not to look at Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s furniture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t come at all\xe2\x80\x94and yet we get on so\r\nwell when we meet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered promptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\r\nI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any cream, you know\xe2\x80\x94shall you mind a slice of lemon\r\ninstead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall like it better.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited while he cut the lemon and\r\ndropped a thin disk into her cup. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not the reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your never coming.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned forward with a shade of\r\nperplexity in her charming eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I knew\xe2\x80\x94I wish I could make\r\nyou out. Of course I know there are men who don\xe2\x80\x99t like me\xe2\x80\x94one can\r\ntell that at a glance. And there are others who are afraid of me:\r\nthey think I want to marry them.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled up at him frankly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you dislike me\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly think I\r\nwant to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I absolve you of that,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had carried his cup to the fireplace, and stood leaning against\r\nthe chimney-piece and looking down on her with an air of indolent\r\namusement. The provocation in her eyes increased his amusement\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad not supposed she would waste her powder on such small game; but\r\nperhaps she was only keeping her hand in; or perhaps a girl of her\r\ntype had no conversation but of the personal kind. At any rate, she\r\nwas amazingly pretty, and he had asked her to tea and must live up\r\nto his obligations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a plunge, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps THAT\xe2\x80\x99S the reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry me. Perhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t regard\r\nit as such a strong inducement to go and see you.\xe2\x80\x9d He felt a slight\r\nshiver down his spine as he ventured this, but her laugh reassured\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Selden, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worthy of you. It\xe2\x80\x99s stupid of you to\r\nmake love to me, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t like you to be stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned\r\nback, sipping her tea with an air so enchantingly judicial that,\r\nif they had been in her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room, he might almost have\r\ntried to disprove her deduction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are men enough to say\r\npleasant things to me, and that what I want is a friend who won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe afraid to say disagreeable ones when I need them? Sometimes I\r\nhave fancied you might be that friend\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, except that\r\nyou are neither a prig nor a bounder, and that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nto pretend with you or be on my guard against you.\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice had\r\ndropped to a note of seriousness, and she sat gazing up at him with\r\nthe troubled gravity of a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much I need such a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt\r\nis full of copy-book axioms, but they were all meant to apply to\r\nconduct in the early fifties. I always feel that to live up to them\r\nwould include wearing book-muslin with gigot sleeves. And the other\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94my best friends\xe2\x80\x94well, they use me or abuse me; but they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a straw what happens to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been about too long\xe2\x80\x94people\r\nare getting tired of me; they are beginning to say I ought to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, during which Selden meditated one or\r\ntwo replies calculated to add a momentary zest to the situation;\r\nbut he rejected them in favour of the simple question: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe coloured and laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see you ARE a friend after all,\r\nand that is one of the disagreeable things I was asking for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned amicably. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmarriage your vocation? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it what you\xe2\x80\x99re all brought up for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so. What else is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. And so why not take the plunge and have it over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak as if I ought to marry the\r\nfirst man who came along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply that you are as hard put to it as that. But\r\nthere must be some one with the requisite qualifications.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cI threw away one or two good chances\r\nwhen I first came out\xe2\x80\x94I suppose every girl does; and you know I\r\nam horribly poor\xe2\x80\x94and very expensive. I must have a great deal of\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden had turned to reach for a cigarette-box on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s become of Dillworth?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, his mother was frightened\xe2\x80\x94she was afraid I should have all the\r\nfamily jewels reset. And she wanted me to promise that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo over the drawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing you are marrying for!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. So she packed him off to India.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard luck\xe2\x80\x94but you can do better than Dillworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered the box, and she took out three or four cigarettes,\r\nputting one between her lips and slipping the others into a little\r\ngold case attached to her long pearl chain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I time? Just a whiff, then.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned forward, holding the\r\ntip of her cigarette to his. As she did so, he noted, with a purely\r\nimpersonal enjoyment, how evenly the black lashes were set in her\r\nsmooth white lids, and how the purplish shade beneath them melted\r\ninto the pure pallor of the cheek.\r\n\r\nShe began to saunter about the room, examining the bookshelves\r\nbetween the puffs of her cigarette-smoke. Some of the volumes\r\nhad the ripe tints of good tooling and old morocco, and her eyes\r\nlingered on them caressingly, not with the appreciation of the\r\nexpert, but with the pleasure in agreeable tones and textures that\r\nwas one of her inmost susceptibilities. Suddenly her expression\r\nchanged from desultory enjoyment to active conjecture, and she\r\nturned to Selden with a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou collect, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94you know about first editions and things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as a man may who has no money to spend. Now and then I\r\npick up something in the rubbish heap; and I go and look on at the\r\nbig sales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had again addressed herself to the shelves, but her eyes now\r\nswept them inattentively, and he saw that she was preoccupied with\r\na new idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Americana\xe2\x80\x94do you collect Americana?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden stared and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s rather out of my line. I\xe2\x80\x99m not really a collector, you\r\nsee; I simply like to have good editions of the books I am fond of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a slight grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Americana are horribly dull, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should fancy so\xe2\x80\x94except to the historian. But your real collector\r\nvalues a thing for its rarity. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose the buyers of\r\nAmericana sit up reading them all night\xe2\x80\x94old Jefferson Gryce\r\ncertainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was listening with keen attention. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet they fetch fabulous\r\nprices, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? It seems so odd to want to pay a lot for an\r\nugly badly-printed book that one is never going to read! And I\r\nsuppose most of the owners of Americana are not historians either?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; very few of the historians can afford to buy them. They have\r\nto use those in the public libraries or in private collections. It\r\nseems to be the mere rarity that attracts the average collector.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had seated himself on an arm of the chair near which she was\r\nstanding, and she continued to question him, asking which were the\r\nrarest volumes, whether the Jefferson Gryce collection was really\r\nconsidered the finest in the world, and what was the largest price\r\never fetched by a single volume.\r\n\r\nIt was so pleasant to sit there looking up at her, as she lifted\r\nnow one book and then another from the shelves, fluttering the\r\npages between her fingers, while her drooping profile was outlined\r\nagainst the warm background of old bindings, that he talked on\r\nwithout pausing to wonder at her sudden interest in so unsuggestive\r\na subject. But he could never be long with her without trying to\r\nfind a reason for what she was doing, and as she replaced his\r\nfirst edition of La Bruyere and turned away from the bookcases,\r\nhe began to ask himself what she had been driving at. Her next\r\nquestion was not of a nature to enlighten him. She paused before\r\nhim with a smile which seemed at once designed to admit him to her\r\nfamiliarity, and to remind him of the restrictions it imposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cnot being rich enough\r\nto buy all the books you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe followed her glance about the room, with its worn furniture and\r\nshabby walls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I just? Do you take me for a saint on a pillar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd having to work\xe2\x80\x94do you mind that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the work itself is not so bad\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m rather fond of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but the being tied down: the routine\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you ever want to\r\nget away, to see new places and people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorribly\xe2\x80\x94especially when I see all my friends rushing to the\r\nsteamer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew a sympathetic breath. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do you mind enough\xe2\x80\x94to marry to\r\nget out of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared.\r\n\r\nShe rose with a sigh, tossing her cigarette into the grate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s the difference\xe2\x80\x94a girl must, a man may if he chooses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe surveyed him critically. \xe2\x80\x9cYour coat\xe2\x80\x99s a little shabby\xe2\x80\x94but who\r\ncares? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep people from asking you to dine. If I were\r\nshabby no one would have me: a woman is asked out as much for\r\nher clothes as for herself. The clothes are the background, the\r\nframe, if you like: they don\xe2\x80\x99t make success, but they are a part\r\nof it. Who wants a dingy woman? We are expected to be pretty and\r\nwell-dressed till we drop\xe2\x80\x94and if we can\xe2\x80\x99t keep it up alone, we have\r\nto go into partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden glanced at her with amusement: it was impossible, even with\r\nher lovely eyes imploring him, to take a sentimental view of her\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, there must be plenty of capital on the look-out for\r\nsuch an investment. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet your fate tonight at the\r\nTrenors\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned his look interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might be going there\xe2\x80\x94oh, not in that capacity! But\r\nthere are to be a lot of your set\xe2\x80\x94Gwen Van Osburgh, the Wetheralls,\r\nLady Cressida Raith\xe2\x80\x94and the George Dorsets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment before the last name, and shot a query through\r\nher lashes; but he remained imperturbable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Trenor asked me; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t get away till the end of the\r\nweek; and those big parties bore me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, so they do me,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of the business\xe2\x80\x94you forget! And besides, if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I\r\nshould be playing bezique with my aunt at Richfield Springs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s almost as bad as marrying Dillworth,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed, and they\r\nboth laughed for pure pleasure in their sudden intimacy.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! I must be off. It\xe2\x80\x99s after five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused before the mantelpiece, studying herself in the mirror\r\nwhile she adjusted her veil. The attitude revealed the long slope\r\nof her slender sides, which gave a kind of wild-wood grace to\r\nher outline\xe2\x80\x94as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the\r\nconventions of the drawing-room; and Selden reflected that it was\r\nthe same streak of sylvan freedom in her nature that lent such\r\nsavour to her artificiality.\r\n\r\nHe followed her across the room to the entrance-hall; but on the\r\nthreshold she held out her hand with a gesture of leave-taking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been delightful; and now you will have to return my visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you want me to see you to the station?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; good bye here, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let her hand lie in his a moment, smiling up at him adorably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood bye, then\xe2\x80\x94and good luck at Bellomont!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, opening the\r\ndoor for her.\r\n\r\nOn the landing she paused to look about her. There were a thousand\r\nchances to one against her meeting anybody, but one could never\r\ntell, and she always paid for her rare indiscretions by a violent\r\nreaction of prudence. There was no one in sight, however, but a\r\nchar-woman who was scrubbing the stairs. Her own stout person and\r\nits surrounding implements took up so much room that Lily, to pass\r\nher, had to gather up her skirts and brush against the wall. As\r\nshe did so, the woman paused in her work and looked up curiously,\r\nresting her clenched red fists on the wet cloth she had just drawn\r\nfrom her pail. She had a broad sallow face, slightly pitted with\r\nsmall-pox, and thin straw-coloured hair through which her scalp\r\nshone unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lily, intending by her politeness to\r\nconvey a criticism of the other\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\nThe woman, without answering, pushed her pail aside, and continued\r\nto stare as Miss Bart swept by with a murmur of silken linings.\r\nLily felt herself flushing under the look. What did the creature\r\nsuppose? Could one never do the simplest, the most harmless thing,\r\nwithout subjecting one\xe2\x80\x99s self to some odious conjecture? Half way\r\ndown the next flight, she smiled to think that a char-woman\xe2\x80\x99s stare\r\nshould so perturb her. The poor thing was probably dazzled by such\r\nan unwonted apparition. But WERE such apparitions unwonted on\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s stairs? Miss Bart was not familiar with the moral code of\r\nbachelors\xe2\x80\x99 flat-houses, and her colour rose again as it occurred to\r\nher that the woman\xe2\x80\x99s persistent gaze implied a groping among past\r\nassociations. But she put aside the thought with a smile at her own\r\nfears, and hastened downward, wondering if she should find a cab\r\nshort of Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nUnder the Georgian porch she paused again, scanning the street for\r\na hansom. None was in sight, but as she reached the sidewalk she\r\nran against a small glossy-looking man with a gardenia in his coat,\r\nwho raised his hat with a surprised exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart? Well\xe2\x80\x94of all people! This IS luck,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared; and she\r\ncaught a twinkle of amused curiosity between his screwed-up lids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x94how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, perceiving that the\r\nirrepressible annoyance on her face was reflected in the sudden\r\nintimacy of his smile.\r\n\r\nMr. Rosedale stood scanning her with interest and approval. He\r\nwas a plump rosy man of the blond Jewish type, with smart London\r\nclothes fitting him like upholstery, and small sidelong eyes which\r\ngave him the air of appraising people as if they were bric-a-brac.\r\nHe glanced up interrogatively at the porch of the Benedick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen up to town for a little shopping, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a\r\ntone which had the familiarity of a touch.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart shrank from it slightly, and then flung herself into\r\nprecipitate explanations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I came up to see my dress-maker. I am just on my way to catch\r\nthe train to the Trenors\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94your dress-maker; just so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said blandly. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthere were any dress-makers in the Benedick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Benedick?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked gently puzzled. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the name of\r\nthis building?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the name: I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s an old word for bachelor,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I happen to own the building\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way I know.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nsmile deepened as he added with increasing assurance: \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must\r\nlet me take you to the station. The Trenors are at Bellomont, of\r\ncourse? You\xe2\x80\x99ve barely time to catch the five-forty. The dress-maker\r\nkept you waiting, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily stiffened under the pleasantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered; and at that moment her eye caught\r\na hansom drifting down Madison Avenue, and she hailed it with a\r\ndesperate gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very kind; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of troubling you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, extending her hand to Mr. Rosedale; and heedless of his\r\nprotestations, she sprang into the rescuing vehicle, and called out\r\na breathless order to the driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hansom she leaned back with a sigh. Why must a girl pay so\r\ndearly for her least escape from routine? Why could one never do\r\na natural thing without having to screen it behind a structure of\r\nartifice? She had yielded to a passing impulse in going to Lawrence\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, and it was so seldom that she could allow herself\r\nthe luxury of an impulse! This one, at any rate, was going to cost\r\nher rather more than she could afford. She was vexed to see that,\r\nin spite of so many years of vigilance, she had blundered twice\r\nwithin five minutes. That stupid story about her dress-maker was\r\nbad enough\xe2\x80\x94it would have been so simple to tell Rosedale that she\r\nhad been taking tea with Selden! The mere statement of the fact\r\nwould have rendered it innocuous. But, after having let herself\r\nbe surprised in a falsehood, it was doubly stupid to snub the\r\nwitness of her discomfiture. If she had had the presence of mind to\r\nlet Rosedale drive her to the station, the concession might have\r\npurchased his silence. He had his race\xe2\x80\x99s accuracy in the appraisal\r\nof values, and to be seen walking down the platform at the crowded\r\nafternoon hour in the company of Miss Lily Bart would have been\r\nmoney in his pocket, as he might himself have phrased it. He knew,\r\nof course, that there would be a large house-party at Bellomont,\r\nand the possibility of being taken for one of Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s guests\r\nwas doubtless included in his calculations. Mr. Rosedale was still\r\nat a stage in his social ascent when it was of importance to\r\nproduce such impressions.\r\n\r\nThe provoking part was that Lily knew all this\xe2\x80\x94knew how easy it\r\nwould have been to silence him on the spot, and how difficult it\r\nmight be to do so afterward. Mr. Simon Rosedale was a man who\r\nmade it his business to know everything about every one, whose\r\nidea of showing himself to be at home in society was to display\r\nan inconvenient familiarity with the habits of those with whom\r\nhe wished to be thought intimate. Lily was sure that within\r\ntwenty-four hours the story of her visiting her dress-maker at\r\nthe Benedick would be in active circulation among Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintances. The worst of it was that she had always snubbed and\r\nignored him. On his first appearance\xe2\x80\x94when her improvident cousin,\r\nJack Stepney, had obtained for him (in return for favours too\r\neasily guessed) a card to one of the vast impersonal Van Osburgh\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrushes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Rosedale, with that mixture of artistic sensibility and\r\nbusiness astuteness which characterizes his race, had instantly\r\ngravitated toward Miss Bart. She understood his motives, for\r\nher own course was guided by as nice calculations. Training and\r\nexperience had taught her to be hospitable to newcomers, since the\r\nmost unpromising might be useful later on, and there were plenty\r\nof available OUBLIETTES to swallow them if they were not. But\r\nsome intuitive repugnance, getting the better of years of social\r\ndiscipline, had made her push Mr. Rosedale into his OUBLIETTE\r\nwithout a trial. He had left behind only the ripple of amusement\r\nwhich his speedy despatch had caused among her friends; and though\r\nlater (to shift the metaphor) he reappeared lower down the stream,\r\nit was only in fleeting glimpses, with long submergences between.\r\n\r\nHitherto Lily had been undisturbed by scruples. In her little set\r\nMr. Rosedale had been pronounced \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible,\xe2\x80\x9d and Jack Stepney\r\nroundly snubbed for his attempt to pay his debts in dinner\r\ninvitations. Even Mrs. Trenor, whose taste for variety had led\r\nher into some hazardous experiments, resisted Jack\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to\r\ndisguise Mr. Rosedale as a novelty, and declared that he was the\r\nsame little Jew who had been served up and rejected at the social\r\nboard a dozen times within her memory; and while Judy Trenor was\r\nobdurate there was small chance of Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s penetrating\r\nbeyond the outer limbo of the Van Osburgh crushes. Jack gave up the\r\ncontest with a laughing \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d and, sticking manfully to his\r\nguns, showed himself with Rosedale at the fashionable restaurants,\r\nin company with the personally vivid if socially obscure ladies who\r\nare available for such purposes. But the attempt had hitherto been\r\nvain, and as Rosedale undoubtedly paid for the dinners, the laugh\r\nremained with his debtor.\r\n\r\nMr. Rosedale, it will be seen, was thus far not a factor to be\r\nfeared\xe2\x80\x94unless one put one\xe2\x80\x99s self in his power. And this was\r\nprecisely what Miss Bart had done. Her clumsy fib had let him see\r\nthat she had something to conceal; and she was sure he had a score\r\nto settle with her. Something in his smile told her he had not\r\nforgotten. She turned from the thought with a little shiver, but\r\nit hung on her all the way to the station, and dogged her down the\r\nplatform with the persistency of Mr. Rosedale himself.\r\n\r\nShe had just time to take her seat before the train started; but\r\nhaving arranged herself in her corner with the instinctive feeling\r\nfor effect which never forsook her, she glanced about in the hope\r\nof seeing some other member of the Trenors\xe2\x80\x99 party. She wanted to\r\nget away from herself, and conversation was the only means of\r\nescape that she knew.\r\n\r\nHer search was rewarded by the discovery of a very blond young man\r\nwith a soft reddish beard, who, at the other end of the carriage,\r\nappeared to be dissembling himself behind an unfolded newspaper.\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s eye brightened, and a faint smile relaxed the drawn lines\r\nof her mouth. She had known that Mr. Percy Gryce was to be at\r\nBellomont, but she had not counted on the luck of having him to\r\nherself in the train; and the fact banished all perturbing thoughts\r\nof Mr. Rosedale. Perhaps, after all, the day was to end more\r\nfavourably than it had begun.\r\n\r\nShe began to cut the pages of a novel, tranquilly studying her\r\nprey through downcast lashes while she organized a method of\r\nattack. Something in his attitude of conscious absorption told\r\nher that he was aware of her presence: no one had ever been quite\r\nso engrossed in an evening paper! She guessed that he was too shy\r\nto come up to her, and that she would have to devise some means\r\nof approach which should not appear to be an advance on her part.\r\nIt amused her to think that any one as rich as Mr. Percy Gryce\r\nshould be shy; but she was gifted with treasures of indulgence for\r\nsuch idiosyncrasies, and besides, his timidity might serve her\r\npurpose better than too much assurance. She had the art of giving\r\nself-confidence to the embarrassed, but she was not equally sure of\r\nbeing able to embarrass the self-confident.\r\n\r\nShe waited till the train had emerged from the tunnel and was\r\nracing between the ragged edges of the northern suburbs. Then,\r\nas it lowered its speed near Yonkers, she rose from her seat and\r\ndrifted slowly down the carriage. As she passed Mr. Gryce, the\r\ntrain gave a lurch, and he was aware of a slender hand gripping the\r\nback of his chair. He rose with a start, his ingenuous face looking\r\nas though it had been dipped in crimson: even the reddish tint in\r\nhis beard seemed to deepen. The train swayed again, almost flinging\r\nMiss Bart into his arms.\r\n\r\nShe steadied herself with a laugh and drew back; but he was\r\nenveloped in the scent of her dress, and his shoulder had felt her\r\nfugitive touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Gryce, is it you? I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\x94I was trying to find the\r\nporter and get some tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand as the train resumed its level rush, and they\r\nstood exchanging a few words in the aisle. Yes\xe2\x80\x94he was going to\r\nBellomont. He had heard she was to be of the party\xe2\x80\x94he blushed again\r\nas he admitted it. And was he to be there for a whole week? How\r\ndelightful!\r\n\r\nBut at this point one or two belated passengers from the last\r\nstation forced their way into the carriage, and Lily had to retreat\r\nto her seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chair next to mine is empty\xe2\x80\x94do take it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said over her\r\nshoulder; and Mr. Gryce, with considerable embarrassment, succeeded\r\nin effecting an exchange which enabled him to transport himself and\r\nhis bags to her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94and here is the porter, and perhaps we can have some tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe signalled to that official, and in a moment, with the ease that\r\nseemed to attend the fulfilment of all her wishes, a little table\r\nhad been set up between the seats, and she had helped Mr. Gryce to\r\nbestow his encumbering properties beneath it.\r\n\r\nWhen the tea came he watched her in silent fascination while\r\nher hands flitted above the tray, looking miraculously fine and\r\nslender in contrast to the coarse china and lumpy bread. It seemed\r\nwonderful to him that any one should perform with such careless\r\nease the difficult task of making tea in public in a lurching\r\ntrain. He would never have dared to order it for himself, lest he\r\nshould attract the notice of his fellow-passengers; but, secure in\r\nthe shelter of her conspicuousness, he sipped the inky draught with\r\na delicious sense of exhilaration.\r\n\r\nLily, with the flavour of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s caravan tea on her lips, had\r\nno great fancy to drown it in the railway brew which seemed such\r\nnectar to her companion; but, rightly judging that one of the\r\ncharms of tea is the fact of drinking it together, she proceeded\r\nto give the last touch to Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment by smiling at him\r\nacross her lifted cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it quite right\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made it too strong?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\r\nsolicitously; and he replied with conviction that he had never\r\ntasted better tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d she reflected; and her imagination was\r\nfired by the thought that Mr. Gryce, who might have sounded the\r\ndepths of the most complex self-indulgence, was perhaps actually\r\ntaking his first journey alone with a pretty woman.\r\n\r\nIt struck her as providential that she should be the instrument\r\nof his initiation. Some girls would not have known how to\r\nmanage him. They would have over-emphasized the novelty of the\r\nadventure, trying to make him feel in it the zest of an escapade.\r\nBut Lily\xe2\x80\x99s methods were more delicate. She remembered that her\r\ncousin Jack Stepney had once defined Mr. Gryce as the young man\r\nwho had promised his mother never to go out in the rain without\r\nhis overshoes; and acting on this hint, she resolved to impart a\r\ngently domestic air to the scene, in the hope that her companion,\r\ninstead of feeling that he was doing something reckless or unusual,\r\nwould merely be led to dwell on the advantage of always having a\r\ncompanion to make one\xe2\x80\x99s tea in the train.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of her efforts, conversation flagged after the tray\r\nhad been removed, and she was driven to take a fresh measurement\r\nof Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s limitations. It was not, after all, opportunity but\r\nimagination that he lacked: he had a mental palate which would\r\nnever learn to distinguish between railway tea and nectar. There\r\nwas, however, one topic she could rely on: one spring that she\r\nhad only to touch to set his simple machinery in motion. She had\r\nrefrained from touching it because it was a last resource, and she\r\nhad relied on other arts to stimulate other sensations; but as a\r\nsettled look of dulness began to creep over his candid features,\r\nshe saw that extreme measures were necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, leaning forward, \xe2\x80\x9care you getting on with your\r\nAmericana?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eye became a degree less opaque: it was as though an incipient\r\nfilm had been removed from it, and she felt the pride of a skilful\r\noperator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few new things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suffused with pleasure, but\r\nlowering his voice as though he feared his fellow-passengers might\r\nbe in league to despoil him.\r\n\r\nShe returned a sympathetic enquiry, and gradually he was drawn\r\non to talk of his latest purchases. It was the one subject which\r\nenabled him to forget himself, or allowed him, rather, to remember\r\nhimself without constraint, because he was at home in it, and could\r\nassert a superiority that there were few to dispute. Hardly any of\r\nhis acquaintances cared for Americana, or knew anything about them;\r\nand the consciousness of this ignorance threw Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge\r\ninto agreeable relief. The only difficulty was to introduce the\r\ntopic and to keep it to the front; most people showed no desire to\r\nhave their ignorance dispelled, and Mr. Gryce was like a merchant\r\nwhose warehouses are crammed with an unmarketable commodity.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Bart, it appeared, really did want to know about\r\nAmericana; and moreover, she was already sufficiently informed to\r\nmake the task of farther instruction as easy as it was agreeable.\r\nShe questioned him intelligently, she heard him submissively; and,\r\nprepared for the look of lassitude which usually crept over his\r\nlisteners\xe2\x80\x99 faces, he grew eloquent under her receptive gaze. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoints\xe2\x80\x9d she had had the presence of mind to glean from Selden, in\r\nanticipation of this very contingency, were serving her to such\r\ngood purpose that she began to think her visit to him had been the\r\nluckiest incident of the day. She had once more shown her talent\r\nfor profiting by the unexpected, and dangerous theories as to the\r\nadvisability of yielding to impulse were germinating under the\r\nsurface of smiling attention which she continued to present to her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s sensations, if less definite, were equally agreeable.\r\nHe felt the confused titillation with which the lower organisms\r\nwelcome the gratification of their needs, and all his senses\r\nfloundered in a vague well-being, through which Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersonality was dimly but pleasantly perceptible.\r\n\r\nMr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Americana had not originated with himself:\r\nit was impossible to think of him as evolving any taste of his\r\nown. An uncle had left him a collection already noted among\r\nbibliophiles; the existence of the collection was the only fact\r\nthat had ever shed glory on the name of Gryce, and the nephew took\r\nas much pride in his inheritance as though it had been his own\r\nwork. Indeed, he gradually came to regard it as such, and to feel a\r\nsense of personal complacency when he chanced on any reference to\r\nthe Gryce Americana. Anxious as he was to avoid personal notice, he\r\ntook, in the printed mention of his name, a pleasure so exquisite\r\nand excessive that it seemed a compensation for his shrinking from\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\nTo enjoy the sensation as often as possible, he subscribed to all\r\nthe reviews dealing with book-collecting in general, and American\r\nhistory in particular, and as allusions to his library abounded\r\nin the pages of these journals, which formed his only reading, he\r\ncame to regard himself as figuring prominently in the public eye,\r\nand to enjoy the thought of the interest which would be excited\r\nif the persons he met in the street, or sat among in travelling,\r\nwere suddenly to be told that he was the possessor of the Gryce\r\nAmericana.\r\n\r\nMost timidities have such secret compensations, and Miss Bart was\r\ndiscerning enough to know that the inner vanity is generally in\r\nproportion to the outer self-depreciation. With a more confident\r\nperson she would not have dared to dwell so long on one topic,\r\nor to show such exaggerated interest in it; but she had rightly\r\nguessed that Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s egoism was a thirsty soil, requiring\r\nconstant nurture from without. Miss Bart had the gift of following\r\nan undercurrent of thought while she appeared to be sailing on the\r\nsurface of conversation; and in this case her mental excursion\r\ntook the form of a rapid survey of Mr. Percy Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s future as\r\ncombined with her own. The Gryces were from Albany, and but lately\r\nintroduced to the metropolis, where the mother and son had come,\r\nafter old Jefferson Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s death, to take possession of his house\r\nin Madison Avenue\xe2\x80\x94an appalling house, all brown stone without and\r\nblack walnut within, with the Gryce library in a fire-proof annex\r\nthat looked like a mausoleum. Lily, however, knew all about them:\r\nyoung Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s arrival had fluttered the maternal breasts of\r\nNew York, and when a girl has no mother to palpitate for her she\r\nmust needs be on the alert for herself. Lily, therefore, had not\r\nonly contrived to put herself in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s way, but had made\r\nthe acquaintance of Mrs. Gryce, a monumental woman with the voice\r\nof a pulpit orator and a mind preoccupied with the iniquities of\r\nher servants, who came sometimes to sit with Mrs. Peniston and\r\nlearn from that lady how she managed to prevent the kitchen-maid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsmuggling groceries out of the house. Mrs. Gryce had a kind of\r\nimpersonal benevolence: cases of individual need she regarded\r\nwith suspicion, but she subscribed to Institutions when their\r\nannual reports showed an impressive surplus. Her domestic duties\r\nwere manifold, for they extended from furtive inspections of the\r\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 bedrooms to unannounced descents to the cellar; but she\r\nhad never allowed herself many pleasures. Once, however, she had\r\nhad a special edition of the Sarum Rule printed in rubric and\r\npresented to every clergyman in the diocese; and the gilt album in\r\nwhich their letters of thanks were pasted formed the chief ornament\r\nof her drawing-room table.\r\n\r\nPercy had been brought up in the principles which so excellent a\r\nwoman was sure to inculcate. Every form of prudence and suspicion\r\nhad been grafted on a nature originally reluctant and cautious,\r\nwith the result that it would have seemed hardly needful for Mrs.\r\nGryce to extract his promise about the overshoes, so little likely\r\nwas he to hazard himself abroad in the rain. After attaining his\r\nmajority, and coming into the fortune which the late Mr. Gryce had\r\nmade out of a patent device for excluding fresh air from hotels,\r\nthe young man continued to live with his mother in Albany; but\r\non Jefferson Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s death, when another large property passed\r\ninto her son\xe2\x80\x99s hands, Mrs. Gryce thought that what she called his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinterests\xe2\x80\x9d demanded his presence in New York. She accordingly\r\ninstalled herself in the Madison Avenue house, and Percy, whose\r\nsense of duty was not inferior to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s, spent all his week\r\ndays in the handsome Broad Street office where a batch of pale men\r\non small salaries had grown grey in the management of the Gryce\r\nestate, and where he was initiated with becoming reverence into\r\nevery detail of the art of accumulation.\r\n\r\nAs far as Lily could learn, this had hitherto been Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\noccupation, and she might have been pardoned for thinking it not\r\ntoo hard a task to interest a young man who had been kept on such\r\nlow diet. At any rate, she felt herself so completely in command of\r\nthe situation that she yielded to a sense of security in which all\r\nfear of Mr. Rosedale, and of the difficulties on which that fear\r\nwas contingent, vanished beyond the edge of thought.\r\n\r\nThe stopping of the train at Garrisons would not have distracted\r\nher from these thoughts, had she not caught a sudden look of\r\ndistress in her companion\xe2\x80\x99s eye. His seat faced toward the door,\r\nand she guessed that he had been perturbed by the approach of an\r\nacquaintance; a fact confirmed by the turning of heads and general\r\nsense of commotion which her own entrance into a railway-carriage\r\nwas apt to produce.\r\n\r\nShe knew the symptoms at once, and was not surprised to be hailed\r\nby the high notes of a pretty woman, who entered the train\r\naccompanied by a maid, a bull-terrier, and a footman staggering\r\nunder a load of bags and dressing-cases.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lily\xe2\x80\x94are you going to Bellomont? Then you can\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nhave your seat, I suppose? But I MUST have a seat in this\r\ncarriage\xe2\x80\x94porter, you must find me a place at once. Can\xe2\x80\x99t some one\r\nbe put somewhere else? I want to be with my friends. Oh, how do you\r\ndo, Mr. Gryce? Do please make him understand that I must have a\r\nseat next to you and Lily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. George Dorset, regardless of the mild efforts of a traveller\r\nwith a carpet-bag, who was doing his best to make room for her\r\nby getting out of the train, stood in the middle of the aisle,\r\ndiffusing about her that general sense of exasperation which a\r\npretty woman on her travels not infrequently creates.\r\n\r\nShe was smaller and thinner than Lily Bart, with a restless\r\npliability of pose, as if she could have been crumpled up and run\r\nthrough a ring, like the sinuous draperies she affected. Her small\r\npale face seemed the mere setting of a pair of dark exaggerated\r\neyes, of which the visionary gaze contrasted curiously with her\r\nself-assertive tone and gestures; so that, as one of her friends\r\nobserved, she was like a disembodied spirit who took up a great\r\ndeal of room.\r\n\r\nHaving finally discovered that the seat adjoining Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas at her disposal, she possessed herself of it with a farther\r\ndisplacement of her surroundings, explaining meanwhile that she had\r\ncome across from Mount Kisco in her motor-car that morning, and had\r\nbeen kicking her heels for an hour at Garrisons, without even the\r\nalleviation of a cigarette, her brute of a husband having neglected\r\nto replenish her case before they parted that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at this hour of the day I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve a single one\r\nleft, have you, Lily?\xe2\x80\x9d she plaintively concluded.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart caught the startled glance of Mr. Percy Gryce, whose own\r\nlips were never defiled by tobacco.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an absurd question, Bertha!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, blushing at the\r\nthought of the store she had laid in at Lawrence Selden\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you smoke? Since when have you given it up? What\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nnever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t either, Mr. Gryce? Ah, of course\xe2\x80\x94how stupid\r\nof me\xe2\x80\x94I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Dorset leaned back against her travelling cushions with a\r\nsmile which made Lily wish there had been no vacant seat beside her\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nBridge at Bellomont usually lasted till the small hours; and when\r\nLily went to bed that night she had played too long for her own\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nFeeling no desire for the self-communion which awaited her in her\r\nroom, she lingered on the broad stairway, looking down into the\r\nhall below, where the last card-players were grouped about the tray\r\nof tall glasses and silver-collared decanters which the butler had\r\njust placed on a low table near the fire.\r\n\r\nThe hall was arcaded, with a gallery supported on columns of\r\npale yellow marble. Tall clumps of flowering plants were grouped\r\nagainst a background of dark foliage in the angles of the walls.\r\nOn the crimson carpet a deer-hound and two or three spaniels dozed\r\nluxuriously before the fire, and the light from the great central\r\nlantern overhead shed a brightness on the women\xe2\x80\x99s hair and struck\r\nsparks from their jewels as they moved.\r\n\r\nThere were moments when such scenes delighted Lily, when they\r\ngratified her sense of beauty and her craving for the external\r\nfinish of life; there were others when they gave a sharper edge\r\nto the meagreness of her own opportunities. This was one of the\r\nmoments when the sense of contrast was uppermost, and she turned\r\naway impatiently as Mrs. George Dorset, glittering in serpentine\r\nspangles, drew Percy Gryce in her wake to a confidential nook\r\nbeneath the gallery.\r\n\r\nIt was not that Miss Bart was afraid of losing her newly-acquired\r\nhold over Mr. Gryce. Mrs. Dorset might startle or dazzle him,\r\nbut she had neither the skill nor the patience to effect his\r\ncapture. She was too self-engrossed to penetrate the recesses of\r\nhis shyness, and besides, why should she care to give herself the\r\ntrouble? At most it might amuse her to make sport of his simplicity\r\nfor an evening\xe2\x80\x94after that he would be merely a burden to her, and\r\nknowing this, she was far too experienced to encourage him. But\r\nthe mere thought of that other woman, who could take a man up and\r\ntoss him aside as she willed, without having to regard him as a\r\npossible factor in her plans, filled Lily Bart with envy. She had\r\nbeen bored all the afternoon by Percy Gryce\xe2\x80\x94the mere thought seemed\r\nto waken an echo of his droning voice\xe2\x80\x94but she could not ignore him\r\non the morrow, she must follow up her success, must submit to more\r\nboredom, must be ready with fresh compliances and adaptabilities,\r\nand all on the bare chance that he might ultimately decide to do\r\nher the honour of boring her for life.\r\n\r\nIt was a hateful fate\xe2\x80\x94but how escape from it? What choice had she?\r\nTo be herself, or a Gerty Farish. As she entered her bedroom, with\r\nits softly-shaded lights, her lace dressing-gown lying across\r\nthe silken bedspread, her little embroidered slippers before the\r\nfire, a vase of carnations filling the air with perfume, and\r\nthe last novels and magazines lying uncut on a table beside the\r\nreading-lamp, she had a vision of Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s cramped flat, with\r\nits cheap conveniences and hideous wall-papers. No; she was not\r\nmade for mean and shabby surroundings, for the squalid compromises\r\nof poverty. Her whole being dilated in an atmosphere of luxury; it\r\nwas the background she required, the only climate she could breathe\r\nin. But the luxury of others was not what she wanted. A few years\r\nago it had sufficed her: she had taken her daily meed of pleasure\r\nwithout caring who provided it. Now she was beginning to chafe at\r\nthe obligations it imposed, to feel herself a mere pensioner on the\r\nsplendour which had once seemed to belong to her. There were even\r\nmoments when she was conscious of having to pay her way.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she had refused to play bridge. She knew she could\r\nnot afford it, and she was afraid of acquiring so expensive a\r\ntaste. She had seen the danger exemplified in more than one of her\r\nassociates\xe2\x80\x94in young Ned Silverton, for instance, the charming fair\r\nboy now seated in abject rapture at the elbow of Mrs. Fisher, a\r\nstriking divorcee with eyes and gowns as emphatic as the head-lines\r\nof her \xe2\x80\x9ccase.\xe2\x80\x9d Lily could remember when young Silverton had\r\nstumbled into their circle, with the air of a strayed Arcadian\r\nwho has published charming sonnets in his college journal. Since\r\nthen he had developed a taste for Mrs. Fisher and bridge, and the\r\nlatter at least had involved him in expenses from which he had been\r\nmore than once rescued by harassed maiden sisters, who treasured\r\nthe sonnets, and went without sugar in their tea to keep their\r\ndarling afloat. Ned\xe2\x80\x99s case was familiar to Lily: she had seen his\r\ncharming eyes\xe2\x80\x94which had a good deal more poetry in them than the\r\nsonnets\xe2\x80\x94change from surprise to amusement, and from amusement\r\nto anxiety, as he passed under the spell of the terrible god of\r\nchance; and she was afraid of discovering the same symptoms in her\r\nown case.\r\n\r\nFor in the last year she had found that her hostesses expected her\r\nto take a place at the card-table. It was one of the taxes she\r\nhad to pay for their prolonged hospitality, and for the dresses\r\nand trinkets which occasionally replenished her insufficient\r\nwardrobe. And since she had played regularly the passion had grown\r\non her. Once or twice of late she had won a large sum, and instead\r\nof keeping it against future losses, had spent it in dress or\r\njewelry; and the desire to atone for this imprudence, combined\r\nwith the increasing exhilaration of the game, drove her to risk\r\nhigher stakes at each fresh venture. She tried to excuse herself\r\non the plea that, in the Trenor set, if one played at all one must\r\neither play high or be set down as priggish or stingy; but she knew\r\nthat the gambling passion was upon her, and that in her present\r\nsurroundings there was small hope of resisting it.\r\n\r\nTonight the luck had been persistently bad, and the little gold\r\npurse which hung among her trinkets was almost empty when she\r\nreturned to her room. She unlocked the wardrobe, and taking out her\r\njewel-case, looked under the tray for the roll of bills from which\r\nshe had replenished the purse before going down to dinner. Only\r\ntwenty dollars were left: the discovery was so startling that for a\r\nmoment she fancied she must have been robbed. Then she took paper\r\nand pencil, and seating herself at the writing-table, tried to\r\nreckon up what she had spent during the day. Her head was throbbing\r\nwith fatigue, and she had to go over the figures again and again;\r\nbut at last it became clear to her that she had lost three hundred\r\ndollars at cards. She took out her cheque-book to see if her\r\nbalance was larger than she remembered, but found she had erred\r\nin the other direction. Then she returned to her calculations;\r\nbut figure as she would, she could not conjure back the vanished\r\nthree hundred dollars. It was the sum she had set aside to pacify\r\nher dress-maker\xe2\x80\x94unless she should decide to use it as a sop to the\r\njeweller. At any rate, she had so many uses for it that its very\r\ninsufficiency had caused her to play high in the hope of doubling\r\nit. But of course she had lost\xe2\x80\x94she who needed every penny, while\r\nBertha Dorset, whose husband showered money on her, must have\r\npocketed at least five hundred, and Judy Trenor, who could have\r\nafforded to lose a thousand a night, had left the table clutching\r\nsuch a heap of bills that she had been unable to shake hands with\r\nher guests when they bade her good night.\r\n\r\nA world in which such things could be seemed a miserable place\r\nto Lily Bart; but then she had never been able to understand the\r\nlaws of a universe which was so ready to leave her out of its\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nShe began to undress without ringing for her maid, whom she had\r\nsent to bed. She had been long enough in bondage to other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasure to be considerate of those who depended on hers, and in\r\nher bitter moods it sometimes struck her that she and her maid were\r\nin the same position, except that the latter received her wages\r\nmore regularly.\r\n\r\nAs she sat before the mirror brushing her hair, her face looked\r\nhollow and pale, and she was frightened by two little lines near\r\nher mouth, faint flaws in the smooth curve of the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I must stop worrying!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless it\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nelectric light\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she reflected, springing up from her seat and\r\nlighting the candles on the dressing-table.\r\n\r\nShe turned out the wall-lights, and peered at herself between the\r\ncandle-flames. The white oval of her face swam out waveringly from\r\na background of shadows, the uncertain light blurring it like a\r\nhaze; but the two lines about the mouth remained.\r\n\r\nLily rose and undressed in haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only because I am tired and have such odious things to think\r\nabout,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept repeating; and it seemed an added injustice that\r\npetty cares should leave a trace on the beauty which was her only\r\ndefence against them.\r\n\r\nBut the odious things were there, and remained with her. She\r\nreturned wearily to the thought of Percy Gryce, as a wayfarer picks\r\nup a heavy load and toils on after a brief rest. She was almost\r\nsure she had \xe2\x80\x9clanded\xe2\x80\x9d him: a few days\xe2\x80\x99 work and she would win her\r\nreward. But the reward itself seemed unpalatable just then: she\r\ncould get no zest from the thought of victory. It would be a rest\r\nfrom worry, no more\xe2\x80\x94and how little that would have seemed to her\r\na few years earlier! Her ambitions had shrunk gradually in the\r\ndesiccating air of failure. But why had she failed? Was it her own\r\nfault or that of destiny?\r\n\r\nShe remembered how her mother, after they had lost their money, used\r\nto say to her with a kind of fierce vindictiveness: \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nit all back\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it all back, with your face.\xe2\x80\x9d... The\r\nremembrance roused a whole train of association, and she lay in the\r\ndarkness reconstructing the past out of which her present had grown.\r\n\r\nA house in which no one ever dined at home unless there was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompany\xe2\x80\x9d; a door-bell perpetually ringing; a hall-table showered\r\nwith square envelopes which were opened in haste, and oblong\r\nenvelopes which were allowed to gather dust in the depths of a\r\nbronze jar; a series of French and English maids giving warning\r\namid a chaos of hurriedly-ransacked wardrobes and dress-closets;\r\nan equally changing dynasty of nurses and footmen; quarrels in the\r\npantry, the kitchen and the drawing-room; precipitate trips to\r\nEurope, and returns with gorged trunks and days of interminable\r\nunpacking; semi-annual discussions as to where the summer should\r\nbe spent, grey interludes of economy and brilliant reactions of\r\nexpense\xe2\x80\x94such was the setting of Lily Bart\xe2\x80\x99s first memories.\r\n\r\nRuling the turbulent element called home was the vigorous and\r\ndetermined figure of a mother still young enough to dance her\r\nball-dresses to rags, while the hazy outline of a neutral-tinted\r\nfather filled an intermediate space between the butler and the man\r\nwho came to wind the clocks. Even to the eyes of infancy, Mrs.\r\nHudson Bart had appeared young; but Lily could not recall the time\r\nwhen her father had not been bald and slightly stooping, with\r\nstreaks of grey in his hair, and a tired walk. It was a shock to\r\nher to learn afterward that he was but two years older than her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nLily seldom saw her father by daylight. All day he was \xe2\x80\x9cdowntown\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand in winter it was long after nightfall when she heard his fagged\r\nstep on the stairs and his hand on the school-room door. He would\r\nkiss her in silence, and ask one or two questions of the nurse or\r\nthe governess; then Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s maid would come to remind him that\r\nhe was dining out, and he would hurry away with a nod to Lily. In\r\nsummer, when he joined them for a Sunday at Newport or Southampton,\r\nhe was even more effaced and silent than in winter. It seemed\r\nto tire him to rest, and he would sit for hours staring at the\r\nsea-line from a quiet corner of the verandah, while the clatter of\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s existence went on unheeded a few feet off. Generally,\r\nhowever, Mrs. Bart and Lily went to Europe for the summer, and\r\nbefore the steamer was half way over Mr. Bart had dipped below the\r\nhorizon. Sometimes his daughter heard him denounced for having\r\nneglected to forward Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s remittances; but for the most part\r\nhe was never mentioned or thought of till his patient stooping\r\nfigure presented itself on the New York dock as a buffer between\r\nthe magnitude of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s luggage and the restrictions of the\r\nAmerican custom-house.\r\n\r\nIn this desultory yet agitated fashion life went on through Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nteens: a zig-zag broken course down which the family craft glided\r\non a rapid current of amusement, tugged at by the underflow of\r\na perpetual need\xe2\x80\x94the need of more money. Lily could not recall\r\nthe time when there had been money enough, and in some vague way\r\nher father seemed always to blame for the deficiency. It could\r\ncertainly not be the fault of Mrs. Bart, who was spoken of by her\r\nfriends as a \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful manager.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bart was famous for the\r\nunlimited effect she produced on limited means; and to the lady and\r\nher acquaintances there was something heroic in living as though\r\none were much richer than one\xe2\x80\x99s bank-book denoted.\r\n\r\nLily was naturally proud of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s aptitude in this line: she\r\nhad been brought up in the faith that, whatever it cost, one must\r\nhave a good cook, and be what Mrs. Bart called \xe2\x80\x9cdecently dressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s worst reproach to her husband was to ask him if he\r\nexpected her to \xe2\x80\x9clive like a pig\xe2\x80\x9d; and his replying in the negative\r\nwas always regarded as a justification for cabling to Paris for an\r\nextra dress or two, and telephoning to the jeweller that he might,\r\nafter all, send home the turquoise bracelet which Mrs. Bart had\r\nlooked at that morning.\r\n\r\nLily knew people who \xe2\x80\x9clived like pigs,\xe2\x80\x9d and their appearance and\r\nsurroundings justified her mother\xe2\x80\x99s repugnance to that form of\r\nexistence. They were mostly cousins, who inhabited dingy houses\r\nwith engravings from Cole\xe2\x80\x99s Voyage of Life on the drawing-room\r\nwalls, and slatternly parlour-maids who said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto visitors calling at an hour when all right-minded persons are\r\nconventionally if not actually out. The disgusting part of it was\r\nthat many of these cousins were rich, so that Lily imbibed the idea\r\nthat if people lived like pigs it was from choice, and through the\r\nlack of any proper standard of conduct. This gave her a sense of\r\nreflected superiority, and she did not need Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s comments on\r\nthe family frumps and misers to foster her naturally lively taste\r\nfor splendour.\r\n\r\nLily was nineteen when circumstances caused her to revise her view\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\nThe previous year she had made a dazzling debut fringed by a heavy\r\nthunder-cloud of bills. The light of the debut still lingered on\r\nthe horizon, but the cloud had thickened; and suddenly it broke.\r\nThe suddenness added to the horror; and there were still times\r\nwhen Lily relived with painful vividness every detail of the day\r\non which the blow fell. She and her mother had been seated at the\r\nluncheon-table, over the CHAUFROIX and cold salmon of the previous\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s dinner: it was one of Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s few economies to consume\r\nin private the expensive remnants of her hospitality. Lily was\r\nfeeling the pleasant languor which is youth\xe2\x80\x99s penalty for dancing\r\ntill dawn; but her mother, in spite of a few lines about the mouth,\r\nand under the yellow waves on her temples, was as alert, determined\r\nand high in colour as if she had risen from an untroubled sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the table, between the melting MARRONS GLACES\r\nand candied cherries, a pyramid of American Beauties lifted their\r\nvigorous stems; they held their heads as high as Mrs. Bart, but\r\ntheir rose-colour had turned to a dissipated purple, and Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsense of fitness was disturbed by their reappearance on the\r\nluncheon-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really think, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x9cwe might\r\nafford a few fresh flowers for luncheon. Just some jonquils or\r\nlilies-of-the-valley\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bart stared. Her own fastidiousness had its eye fixed on the\r\nworld, and she did not care how the luncheon-table looked when\r\nthere was no one present at it but the family. But she smiled at\r\nher daughter\xe2\x80\x99s innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLilies-of-the-valley,\xe2\x80\x9d she said calmly, \xe2\x80\x9ccost two dollars a dozen\r\nat this season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily was not impressed. She knew very little of the value of money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not take more than six dozen to fill that bowl,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nargued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix dozen what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice in the doorway.\r\n\r\nThe two women looked up in surprise; though it was a Saturday, the\r\nsight of Mr. Bart at luncheon was an unwonted one. But neither\r\nhis wife nor his daughter was sufficiently interested to ask an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nMr. Bart dropped into a chair, and sat gazing absently at the\r\nfragment of jellied salmon which the butler had placed before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only saying,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily began, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I hate to see faded flowers\r\nat luncheon; and mother says a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley would\r\nnot cost more than twelve dollars. Mayn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell the florist to\r\nsend a few every day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned confidently toward her father: he seldom refused her\r\nanything, and Mrs. Bart had taught her to plead with him when her\r\nown entreaties failed.\r\n\r\nMr. Bart sat motionless, his gaze still fixed on the salmon, and\r\nhis lower jaw dropped; he looked even paler than usual, and his\r\nthin hair lay in untidy streaks on his forehead. Suddenly he looked\r\nat his daughter and laughed. The laugh was so strange that Lily\r\ncoloured under it: she disliked being ridiculed, and her father\r\nseemed to see something ridiculous in the request. Perhaps he\r\nthought it foolish that she should trouble him about such a trifle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve dollars\xe2\x80\x94twelve dollars a day for flowers? Oh, certainly, my\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94give him an order for twelve hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued to laugh.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bart gave him a quick glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait, Poleworth\xe2\x80\x94I will ring for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the\r\nbutler.\r\n\r\nThe butler withdrew with an air of silent disapproval, leaving the\r\nremains of the CHAUFROIX on the sideboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Hudson? Are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bart severely.\r\n\r\nShe had no tolerance for scenes which were not of her own making,\r\nand it was odious to her that her husband should make a show of\r\nhimself before the servants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIll?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m ruined,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nLily made a frightened sound, and Mrs. Bart rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuined\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; but controlling herself instantly, she\r\nturned a calm face to Lily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut the pantry door,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nLily obeyed, and when she turned back into the room her father was\r\nsitting with both elbows on the table, the plate of salmon between\r\nthem, and his head bowed on his hands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bart stood over him with a white face which made her hair\r\nunnaturally yellow. She looked at Lily as the latter approached:\r\nher look was terrible, but her voice was modulated to a ghastly\r\ncheerfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father is not well\xe2\x80\x94he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he is saying. It\r\nis nothing\xe2\x80\x94but you had better go upstairs; and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to the\r\nservants,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nLily obeyed; she always obeyed when her mother spoke in that\r\nvoice. She had not been deceived by Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s words: she knew\r\nat once that they were ruined. In the dark hours which followed,\r\nthat awful fact overshadowed even her father\xe2\x80\x99s slow and difficult\r\ndying. To his wife he no longer counted: he had become extinct\r\nwhen he ceased to fulfil his purpose, and she sat at his side\r\nwith the provisional air of a traveller who waits for a belated\r\ntrain to start. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were softer: she pitied him in a\r\nfrightened ineffectual way. But the fact that he was for the most\r\npart unconscious, and that his attention, when she stole into the\r\nroom, drifted away from her after a moment, made him even more of a\r\nstranger than in the nursery days when he had never come home till\r\nafter dark. She seemed always to have seen him through a blur\xe2\x80\x94first\r\nof sleepiness, then of distance and indifference\xe2\x80\x94and now the fog\r\nhad thickened till he was almost indistinguishable. If she could\r\nhave performed any little services for him, or have exchanged with\r\nhim a few of those affecting words which an extensive perusal of\r\nfiction had led her to connect with such occasions, the filial\r\ninstinct might have stirred in her; but her pity, finding no active\r\nexpression, remained in a state of spectatorship, overshadowed by\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s grim unflagging resentment. Every look and act of Mrs.\r\nBart\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are sorry for him now\xe2\x80\x94but you will feel\r\ndifferently when you see what he has done to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to Lily when her father died.\r\n\r\nThen a long winter set in. There was a little money left, but to\r\nMrs. Bart it seemed worse than nothing\xe2\x80\x94the mere mockery of what\r\nshe was entitled to. What was the use of living if one had to live\r\nlike a pig? She sank into a kind of furious apathy, a state of\r\ninert anger against fate. Her faculty for \xe2\x80\x9cmanaging\xe2\x80\x9d deserted her,\r\nor she no longer took sufficient pride in it to exert it. It was\r\nwell enough to \xe2\x80\x9cmanage\xe2\x80\x9d when by so doing one could keep one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ncarriage; but when one\xe2\x80\x99s best contrivance did not conceal the fact\r\nthat one had to go on foot, the effort was no longer worth making.\r\n\r\nLily and her mother wandered from place to place, now paying long\r\nvisits to relations whose house-keeping Mrs. Bart criticized, and\r\nwho deplored the fact that she let Lily breakfast in bed when the\r\ngirl had no prospects before her, and now vegetating in cheap\r\ncontinental refuges, where Mrs. Bart held herself fiercely aloof\r\nfrom the frugal tea-tables of her companions in misfortune. She was\r\nespecially careful to avoid her old friends and the scenes of her\r\nformer successes. To be poor seemed to her such a confession of\r\nfailure that it amounted to disgrace; and she detected a note of\r\ncondescension in the friendliest advances.\r\n\r\nOnly one thought consoled her, and that was the contemplation of\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s beauty. She studied it with a kind of passion, as though\r\nit were some weapon she had slowly fashioned for her vengeance.\r\nIt was the last asset in their fortunes, the nucleus around which\r\ntheir life was to be rebuilt. She watched it jealously, as though\r\nit were her own property and Lily its mere custodian; and she\r\ntried to instil into the latter a sense of the responsibility that\r\nsuch a charge involved. She followed in imagination the career\r\nof other beauties, pointing out to her daughter what might be\r\nachieved through such a gift, and dwelling on the awful warning of\r\nthose who, in spite of it, had failed to get what they wanted: to\r\nMrs. Bart, only stupidity could explain the lamentable denouement\r\nof some of her examples. She was not above the inconsistency of\r\ncharging fate, rather than herself, with her own misfortunes; but\r\nshe inveighed so acrimoniously against love-matches that Lily would\r\nhave fancied her own marriage had been of that nature, had not Mrs.\r\nBart frequently assured her that she had been \xe2\x80\x9ctalked into it\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nwhom, she never made clear.\r\n\r\nLily was duly impressed by the magnitude of her opportunities. The\r\ndinginess of her present life threw into enchanting relief the\r\nexistence to which she felt herself entitled. To a less illuminated\r\nintelligence Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s counsels might have been dangerous; but\r\nLily understood that beauty is only the raw material of conquest,\r\nand that to convert it into success other arts are required. She\r\nknew that to betray any sense of superiority was a subtler form of\r\nthe stupidity her mother denounced, and it did not take her long\r\nto learn that a beauty needs more tact than the possessor of an\r\naverage set of features.\r\n\r\nHer ambitions were not as crude as Mrs. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s. It had been among\r\nthat lady\xe2\x80\x99s grievances that her husband\xe2\x80\x94in the early days, before\r\nhe was too tired\xe2\x80\x94had wasted his evenings in what she vaguely\r\ndescribed as \xe2\x80\x9creading poetry\xe2\x80\x9d; and among the effects packed off to\r\nauction after his death were a score or two of dingy volumes which\r\nhad struggled for existence among the boots and medicine bottles of\r\nhis dressing-room shelves. There was in Lily a vein of sentiment,\r\nperhaps transmitted from this source, which gave an idealizing\r\ntouch to her most prosaic purposes. She liked to think of her\r\nbeauty as a power for good, as giving her the opportunity to attain\r\na position where she should make her influence felt in the vague\r\ndiffusion of refinement and good taste. She was fond of pictures\r\nand flowers, and of sentimental fiction, and she could not help\r\nthinking that the possession of such tastes ennobled her desire for\r\nworldly advantages. She would not indeed have cared to marry a man\r\nwho was merely rich: she was secretly ashamed of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s crude\r\npassion for money. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s preference would have been for an English\r\nnobleman with political ambitions and vast estates; or, for second\r\nchoice, an Italian prince with a castle in the Apennines and an\r\nhereditary office in the Vatican. Lost causes had a romantic charm\r\nfor her, and she liked to picture herself as standing aloof from\r\nthe vulgar press of the Quirinal, and sacrificing her pleasure to\r\nthe claims of an immemorial tradition....\r\n\r\nHow long ago and how far off it all seemed! Those ambitions were\r\nhardly more futile and childish than the earlier ones which had\r\ncentred about the possession of a French jointed doll with real\r\nhair. Was it only ten years since she had wavered in imagination\r\nbetween the English earl and the Italian prince? Relentlessly her\r\nmind travelled on over the dreary interval....\r\n\r\nAfter two years of hungry roaming Mrs. Bart had died\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94died of a\r\ndeep disgust. She had hated dinginess, and it was her fate to be\r\ndingy. Her visions of a brilliant marriage for Lily had faded after\r\nthe first year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople can\xe2\x80\x99t marry you if they don\xe2\x80\x99t see you\xe2\x80\x94and how can they see\r\nyou in these holes where we\xe2\x80\x99re stuck?\xe2\x80\x9d That was the burden of her\r\nlament; and her last adjuration to her daughter was to escape from\r\ndinginess if she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let it creep up on you and drag you down. Fight your way out\r\nof it somehow\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re young and can do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted.\r\n\r\nShe had died during one of their brief visits to New York, and\r\nthere Lily at once became the centre of a family council composed\r\nof the wealthy relatives whom she had been taught to despise\r\nfor living like pigs. It may be that they had an inkling of the\r\nsentiments in which she had been brought up, for none of them\r\nmanifested a very lively desire for her company; indeed, the\r\nquestion threatened to remain unsolved till Mrs. Peniston with a\r\nsigh announced: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try her for a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery one was surprised, but one and all concealed their surprise,\r\nlest Mrs. Peniston should be alarmed by it into reconsidering her\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston was Mr. Bart\xe2\x80\x99s widowed sister, and if she was by\r\nno means the richest of the family group, its other members\r\nnevertheless abounded in reasons why she was clearly destined by\r\nProvidence to assume the charge of Lily. In the first place she was\r\nalone, and it would be charming for her to have a young companion.\r\nThen she sometimes travelled, and Lily\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity with foreign\r\ncustoms\xe2\x80\x94deplored as a misfortune by her more conservative\r\nrelatives\xe2\x80\x94would at least enable her to act as a kind of courier.\r\nBut as a matter of fact Mrs. Peniston had not been affected by\r\nthese considerations. She had taken the girl simply because no one\r\nelse would have her, and because she had the kind of moral MAUVAISE\r\nHONTE which makes the public display of selfishness difficult,\r\nthough it does not interfere with its private indulgence. It would\r\nhave been impossible for Mrs. Peniston to be heroic on a desert\r\nisland, but with the eyes of her little world upon her she took a\r\ncertain pleasure in her act.\r\n\r\nShe reaped the reward to which disinterestedness is entitled,\r\nand found an agreeable companion in her niece. She had expected\r\nto find Lily headstrong, critical and \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for even Mrs.\r\nPeniston, though she occasionally went abroad, had the family dread\r\nof foreignness\xe2\x80\x94but the girl showed a pliancy, which, to a more\r\npenetrating mind than her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, might have been less reassuring\r\nthan the open selfishness of youth. Misfortune had made Lily supple\r\ninstead of hardening her, and a pliable substance is less easy to\r\nbreak than a stiff one.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston, however, did not suffer from her niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadaptability. Lily had no intention of taking advantage of her\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s good-nature. She was in truth grateful for the refuge\r\noffered her: Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s opulent interior was at least not\r\nexternally dingy. But dinginess is a quality which assumes all\r\nmanner of disguises; and Lily soon found that it was as latent\r\nin the expensive routine of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s life as in the makeshift\r\nexistence of a continental pension.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston was one of the episodical persons who form the\r\npadding of life. It was impossible to believe that she had herself\r\never been a focus of activities. The most vivid thing about her\r\nwas the fact that her grandmother had been a Van Alstyne. This\r\nconnection with the well-fed and industrious stock of early New\r\nYork revealed itself in the glacial neatness of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room and in the excellence of her cuisine. She belonged\r\nto the class of old New Yorkers who have always lived well,\r\ndressed expensively, and done little else; and to these inherited\r\nobligations Mrs. Peniston faithfully conformed. She had always\r\nbeen a looker-on at life, and her mind resembled one of those\r\nlittle mirrors which her Dutch ancestors were accustomed to affix\r\nto their upper windows, so that from the depths of an impenetrable\r\ndomesticity they might see what was happening in the street.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston was the owner of a country-place in New Jersey,\r\nbut she had never lived there since her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94a remote\r\nevent, which appeared to dwell in her memory chiefly as a dividing\r\npoint in the personal reminiscences that formed the staple of her\r\nconversation. She was a woman who remembered dates with intensity,\r\nand could tell at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice whether the drawing-room\r\ncurtains had been renewed before or after Mr. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston thought the country lonely and trees damp, and\r\ncherished a vague fear of meeting a bull. To guard against such\r\ncontingencies she frequented the more populous watering-places,\r\nwhere she installed herself impersonally in a hired house and\r\nlooked on at life through the matting screen of her verandah. In\r\nthe care of such a guardian, it soon became clear to Lily that\r\nshe was to enjoy only the material advantages of good food and\r\nexpensive clothing; and, though far from underrating these, she\r\nwould gladly have exchanged them for what Mrs. Bart had taught her\r\nto regard as opportunities. She sighed to think what her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfierce energies would have accomplished, had they been coupled\r\nwith Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s resources. Lily had abundant energy of her\r\nown, but it was restricted by the necessity of adapting herself to\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s habits. She saw that at all costs she must keep Mrs.\r\nPeniston\xe2\x80\x99s favour till, as Mrs. Bart would have phrased it, she\r\ncould stand on her own legs. Lily had no mind for the vagabond life\r\nof the poor relation, and to adapt herself to Mrs. Peniston she\r\nhad, to some degree, to assume that lady\xe2\x80\x99s passive attitude. She\r\nhad fancied at first that it would be easy to draw her aunt into\r\nthe whirl of her own activities, but there was a static force in\r\nMrs. Peniston against which her niece\xe2\x80\x99s efforts spent themselves\r\nin vain. To attempt to bring her into active relation with life\r\nwas like tugging at a piece of furniture which has been screwed\r\nto the floor. She did not, indeed, expect Lily to remain equally\r\nimmovable: she had all the American guardian\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence for the\r\nvolatility of youth.\r\n\r\nShe had indulgence also for certain other habits of her niece\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nIt seemed to her natural that Lily should spend all her money on\r\ndress, and she supplemented the girl\xe2\x80\x99s scanty income by occasional\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chandsome presents\xe2\x80\x9d meant to be applied to the same purpose.\r\nLily, who was intensely practical, would have preferred a fixed\r\nallowance; but Mrs. Peniston liked the periodical recurrence of\r\ngratitude evoked by unexpected cheques, and was perhaps shrewd\r\nenough to perceive that such a method of giving kept alive in her\r\nniece a salutary sense of dependence.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, Mrs. Peniston had not felt called upon to do anything\r\nfor her charge: she had simply stood aside and let her take the\r\nfield. Lily had taken it, at first with the confidence of assured\r\npossessorship, then with gradually narrowing demands, till now\r\nshe found herself actually struggling for a foothold on the\r\nbroad space which had once seemed her own for the asking. How it\r\nhappened she did not yet know. Sometimes she thought it was because\r\nMrs. Peniston had been too passive, and again she feared it was\r\nbecause she herself had not been passive enough. Had she shown an\r\nundue eagerness for victory? Had she lacked patience, pliancy and\r\ndissimulation? Whether she charged herself with these faults or\r\nabsolved herself from them, made no difference in the sum-total\r\nof her failure. Younger and plainer girls had been married off by\r\ndozens, and she was nine-and-twenty, and still Miss Bart.\r\n\r\nShe was beginning to have fits of angry rebellion against fate,\r\nwhen she longed to drop out of the race and make an independent\r\nlife for herself. But what manner of life would it be? She had\r\nbarely enough money to pay her dress-makers\xe2\x80\x99 bills and her gambling\r\ndebts; and none of the desultory interests which she dignified with\r\nthe name of tastes was pronounced enough to enable her to live\r\ncontentedly in obscurity. Ah, no\xe2\x80\x94she was too intelligent not to be\r\nhonest with herself. She knew that she hated dinginess as much as\r\nher mother had hated it, and to her last breath she meant to fight\r\nagainst it, dragging herself up again and again above its flood\r\ntill she gained the bright pinnacles of success which presented\r\nsuch a slippery surface to her clutch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, on her breakfast tray, Miss Bart found a note\r\nfrom her hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest Lily,\xe2\x80\x9d it ran, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is not too much of a bore to be\r\ndown by ten, will you come to my sitting-room to help me with some\r\ntiresome things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily tossed aside the note and subsided on her pillows with a sigh.\r\nIt WAS a bore to be down by ten\xe2\x80\x94an hour regarded at Bellomont as\r\nvaguely synchronous with sunrise\xe2\x80\x94and she knew too well the nature\r\nof the tiresome things in question. Miss Pragg, the secretary,\r\nhad been called away, and there would be notes and dinner-cards\r\nto write, lost addresses to hunt up, and other social drudgery to\r\nperform. It was understood that Miss Bart should fill the gap in\r\nsuch emergencies, and she usually recognized the obligation without\r\na murmur.\r\n\r\nToday, however, it renewed the sense of servitude which the\r\nprevious night\xe2\x80\x99s review of her cheque-book had produced. Everything\r\nin her surroundings ministered to feelings of ease and amenity.\r\nThe windows stood open to the sparkling freshness of the September\r\nmorning, and between the yellow boughs she caught a perspective of\r\nhedges and parterres leading by degrees of lessening formality to\r\nthe free undulations of the park. Her maid had kindled a little\r\nfire on the hearth, and it contended cheerfully with the sunlight\r\nwhich slanted across the moss-green carpet and caressed the curved\r\nsides of an old marquetry desk. Near the bed stood a table holding\r\nher breakfast tray, with its harmonious porcelain and silver,\r\na handful of violets in a slender glass, and the morning paper\r\nfolded beneath her letters. There was nothing new to Lily in these\r\ntokens of a studied luxury; but, though they formed a part of her\r\natmosphere, she never lost her sensitiveness to their charm. Mere\r\ndisplay left her with a sense of superior distinction; but she felt\r\nan affinity to all the subtler manifestations of wealth.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s summons, however, suddenly recalled her state of\r\ndependence, and she rose and dressed in a mood of irritability that\r\nshe was usually too prudent to indulge. She knew that such emotions\r\nleave lines on the face as well as in the character, and she had\r\nmeant to take warning by the little creases which her midnight\r\nsurvey had revealed.\r\n\r\nThe matter of course tone of Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s greeting deepened her\r\nirritation. If one did drag one\xe2\x80\x99s self out of bed at such an hour,\r\nand come down fresh and radiant to the monotony of note-writing,\r\nsome special recognition of the sacrifice seemed fitting. But Mrs.\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s tone showed no consciousness of the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lily, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice of you,\xe2\x80\x9d she merely sighed across the\r\nchaos of letters, bills and other domestic documents which gave\r\nan incongruously commercial touch to the slender elegance of her\r\nwriting-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are such lots of horrors this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, clearing\r\na space in the centre of the confusion and rising to yield her seat\r\nto Miss Bart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor was a tall fair woman, whose height just saved her\r\nfrom redundancy. Her rosy blondness had survived some forty years\r\nof futile activity without showing much trace of ill-usage except\r\nin a diminished play of feature. It was difficult to define her\r\nbeyond saying that she seemed to exist only as a hostess, not so\r\nmuch from any exaggerated instinct of hospitality as because she\r\ncould not sustain life except in a crowd. The collective nature\r\nof her interests exempted her from the ordinary rivalries of her\r\nsex, and she knew no more personal emotion than that of hatred for\r\nthe woman who presumed to give bigger dinners or have more amusing\r\nhouse-parties than herself. As her social talents, backed by Mr.\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s bank-account, almost always assured her ultimate triumph\r\nin such competitions, success had developed in her an unscrupulous\r\ngood nature toward the rest of her sex, and in Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nutilitarian classification of her friends, Mrs. Trenor ranked as\r\nthe woman who was least likely to \xe2\x80\x9cgo back\xe2\x80\x9d on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was simply inhuman of Pragg to go off now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Trenor\r\ndeclared, as her friend seated herself at the desk. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says her\r\nsister is going to have a baby\xe2\x80\x94as if that were anything to having\r\na house-party! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I shall get most horribly mixed up and\r\nthere will be some awful rows. When I was down at Tuxedo I asked a\r\nlot of people for next week, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve mislaid the list and can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember who is coming. And this week is going to be a horrid\r\nfailure too\xe2\x80\x94and Gwen Van Osburgh will go back and tell her mother\r\nhow bored people were. I did mean to ask the Wetheralls\xe2\x80\x94that was a\r\nblunder of Gus\xe2\x80\x99s. They disapprove of Carry Fisher, you know. As if\r\none could help having Carry Fisher! It WAS foolish of her to get\r\nthat second divorce\xe2\x80\x94Carry always overdoes things\xe2\x80\x94but she said the\r\nonly way to get a penny out of Fisher was to divorce him and make\r\nhim pay alimony. And poor Carry has to consider every dollar. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreally absurd of Alice Wetherall to make such a fuss about meeting\r\nher, when one thinks of what society is coming to. Some one said\r\nthe other day that there was a divorce and a case of appendicitis\r\nin every family one knows. Besides, Carry is the only person who\r\ncan keep Gus in a good humour when we have bores in the house. Have\r\nyou noticed that ALL the husbands like her? All, I mean, except her\r\nown. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather clever of her to have made a specialty of devoting\r\nherself to dull people\xe2\x80\x94the field is such a large one, and she has\r\nit practically to herself. She finds compensations, no doubt\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nshe borrows money of Gus\xe2\x80\x94but then I\xe2\x80\x99d PAY her to keep him in a good\r\nhumour, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor paused to enjoy the spectacle of Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to\r\nunravel her tangled correspondence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is only the Wetheralls and Carry,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, with a\r\nfresh note of lament. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully disappointed in\r\nLady Cressida Raith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDisappointed? Had you known her before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy, no\xe2\x80\x94never saw her till yesterday. Lady Skiddaw sent her\r\nover with letters to the Van Osburghs, and I heard that Maria Van\r\nOsburgh was asking a big party to meet her this week, so I thought\r\nit would be fun to get her away, and Jack Stepney, who knew her\r\nin India, managed it for me. Maria was furious, and actually had\r\nthe impudence to make Gwen invite herself here, so that they\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be QUITE out of it\xe2\x80\x94if I\xe2\x80\x99d known what Lady Cressida was\r\nlike, they could have had her and welcome! But I thought any\r\nfriend of the Skiddaws\xe2\x80\x99 was sure to be amusing. You remember what\r\nfun Lady Skiddaw was? There were times when I simply had to send\r\nthe girls out of the room. Besides, Lady Cressida is the Duchess\r\nof Beltshire\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and I naturally supposed she was the same\r\nsort; but you never can tell in those English families. They are\r\nso big that there\xe2\x80\x99s room for all kinds, and it turns out that Lady\r\nCressida is the moral one\xe2\x80\x94married a clergyman and does missionary\r\nwork in the East End. Think of my taking such a lot of trouble\r\nabout a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who wears Indian jewelry and botanizes!\r\nShe made Gus take her all through the glass-houses yesterday, and\r\nbothered him to death by asking him the names of the plants. Fancy\r\ntreating Gus as if he were the gardener!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor brought this out in a CRESCENDO of indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, perhaps Lady Cressida will reconcile the Wetheralls to\r\nmeeting Carry Fisher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Bart pacifically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I hope so! But she is boring all the men horribly, and\r\nif she takes to distributing tracts, as I hear she does, it will\r\nbe too depressing. The worst of it is that she would have been so\r\nuseful at the right time. You know we have to have the Bishop once\r\na year, and she would have given just the right tone to things.\r\nI always have horrid luck about the Bishop\xe2\x80\x99s visits,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs.\r\nTrenor, whose present misery was being fed by a rapidly rising tide\r\nof reminiscence; \xe2\x80\x9clast year, when he came, Gus forgot all about his\r\nbeing here, and brought home the Ned Wintons and the Farleys\xe2\x80\x94five\r\ndivorces and six sets of children between them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is Lady Cressida going?\xe2\x80\x9d Lily enquired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor cast up her eyes in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, if one only\r\nknew! I was in such a hurry to get her away from Maria that I\r\nactually forgot to name a date, and Gus says she told some one she\r\nmeant to stop here all winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo stop here? In this house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly\xe2\x80\x94in America. But if no one else asks her\xe2\x80\x94you know\r\nthey NEVER go to hotels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Gus only said it to frighten you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I heard her tell Bertha Dorset that she had six months to put\r\nin while her husband was taking the cure in the Engadine. You\r\nshould have seen Bertha look vacant! But it\xe2\x80\x99s no joke, you know\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nshe stays here all the autumn she\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil everything, and Maria\r\nVan Osburgh will simply exult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this affecting vision Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled with\r\nself-pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Judy\xe2\x80\x94as if any one were ever bored at Bellomont!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart\r\ntactfully protested. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know perfectly well that, if Mrs. Van\r\nOsburgh were to get all the right people and leave you with all the\r\nwrong ones, you\xe2\x80\x99d manage to make things go off, and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch an assurance would usually have restored Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplacency; but on this occasion it did not chase the cloud from\r\nher brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t only Lady Cressida,\xe2\x80\x9d she lamented. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything has gone\r\nwrong this week. I can see that Bertha Dorset is furious with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFurious with you? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I told her that Lawrence Selden was coming; but he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, after all, and she\xe2\x80\x99s quite unreasonable enough to think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart put down her pen and sat absently gazing at the note she\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was all over,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is, on his side. And of course Bertha has been idle since.\r\nBut I fancy she\xe2\x80\x99s out of a job just at present\xe2\x80\x94and some one gave me\r\na hint that I had better ask Lawrence. Well, I DID ask him\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him come; and now I suppose she\xe2\x80\x99ll take it out of me\r\nby being perfectly nasty to every one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she may take it out of HIM by being perfectly charming\xe2\x80\x94to some\r\none else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor shook her head dolefully. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\nAnd who else is there? Alice Wetherall won\xe2\x80\x99t let Lucius out of her\r\nsight. Ned Silverton can\xe2\x80\x99t take his eyes off Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x94poor boy!\r\nGus is bored by Bertha, Jack Stepney knows her too well\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nto be sure, there\xe2\x80\x99s Percy Gryce!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat up smiling at the thought.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s countenance did not reflect the smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she and Mr. Gryce would not be likely to hit it off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that she\xe2\x80\x99d shock him and he\xe2\x80\x99d bore her? Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nsuch a bad beginning, you know. But I hope she won\xe2\x80\x99t take it into\r\nher head to be nice to him, for I asked him here on purpose for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cMERCI DU COMPLIMENT! I should certainly have no show\r\nagainst Bertha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I am uncomplimentary? I\xe2\x80\x99m not really, you know. Every\r\none knows you\xe2\x80\x99re a thousand times handsomer and cleverer than\r\nBertha; but then you\xe2\x80\x99re not nasty. And for always getting what she\r\nwants in the long run, commend me to a nasty woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart stared in affected reproval. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were so fond\r\nof Bertha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s much safer to be fond of dangerous people. But she\r\nIS dangerous\xe2\x80\x94and if I ever saw her up to mischief it\xe2\x80\x99s now. I can\r\ntell by poor George\xe2\x80\x99s manner. That man is a perfect barometer\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nalways knows when Bertha is going to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo fall?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be shocking! You know he believes in her still. And of\r\ncourse I don\xe2\x80\x99t say there\xe2\x80\x99s any real harm in Bertha. Only she\r\ndelights in making people miserable, and especially poor George.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he seems cut out for the part\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder she likes more\r\ncheerful companionship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, George is not as dismal as you think. If Bertha did worry him\r\nhe would be quite different. Or if she\xe2\x80\x99d leave him alone, and let\r\nhim arrange his life as he pleases. But she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dare lose her\r\nhold of him on account of the money, and so when HE isn\xe2\x80\x99t jealous\r\nshe pretends to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart went on writing in silence, and her hostess sat following\r\nher train of thought with frowning intensity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed after a long pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncall up Lawrence on the telephone and tell him he simply MUST come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lily, with a quick suffusion of colour. The blush\r\nsurprised her almost as much as it did her hostess, who, though\r\nnot commonly observant of facial changes, sat staring at her with\r\npuzzled eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Lily, how handsome you are! Why? Do you dislike him\r\nso much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; I like him. But if you are actuated by the benevolent\r\nintention of protecting me from Bertha\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need your\r\nprotection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor sat up with an exclamation. \xe2\x80\x9cLily!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94PERCY? Do you mean\r\nto say you\xe2\x80\x99ve actually done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI only mean to say that Mr. Gryce and I are\r\ngetting to be very good friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Trenor fixed a rapt eye upon her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know they\r\nsay he has eight hundred thousand a year\xe2\x80\x94and spends nothing, except\r\non some rubbishy old books. And his mother has heart-disease and\r\nwill leave him a lot more. OH, LILY, DO GO SLOWLY,\xe2\x80\x9d her friend\r\nadjured her.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart continued to smile without annoyance. \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, for\r\ninstance,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cbe in any haste to tell him that he had a\r\nlot of rubbishy old books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course not; I know you\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful about getting up\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s subjects. But he\xe2\x80\x99s horribly shy, and easily shocked,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you say it, Judy? I have the reputation of being on the\r\nhunt for a rich husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that; he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it of you\xe2\x80\x94at first,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Trenor, with candid shrewdness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you know things are\r\nrather lively here at times\xe2\x80\x94I must give Jack and Gus a hint\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nif he thought you were what his mother would call fast\xe2\x80\x94oh, well,\r\nyou know what I mean. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wear your scarlet CREPE-DE-CHINE for\r\ndinner, and don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke if you can help it, Lily dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily pushed aside her finished work with a dry smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re very\r\nkind, Judy: I\xe2\x80\x99ll lock up my cigarettes and wear that last year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress you sent me this morning. And if you are really interested\r\nin my career, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll be kind enough not to ask me to play\r\nbridge again this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBridge? Does he mind bridge, too? Oh, Lily, what an awful life\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll lead! But of course I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you give me a hint\r\nlast night? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, you poor duck, to see\r\nyou happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Trenor, glowing with her sex\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness to smooth the\r\ncourse of true love, enveloped Lily in a long embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite sure,\xe2\x80\x9d she added solicitously, as the latter\r\nextricated herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to telephone for\r\nLawrence Selden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next three days demonstrated to her own complete satisfaction\r\nMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manage her affairs without extraneous aid.\r\n\r\nAs she sat, on the Saturday afternoon, on the terrace at Bellomont,\r\nshe smiled at Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s fear that she might go too fast. If\r\nsuch a warning had ever been needful, the years had taught her a\r\nsalutary lesson, and she flattered herself that she now knew how to\r\nadapt her pace to the object of pursuit. In the case of Mr. Gryce\r\nshe had found it well to flutter ahead, losing herself elusively\r\nand luring him on from depth to depth of unconscious intimacy. The\r\nsurrounding atmosphere was propitious to this scheme of courtship.\r\nMrs. Trenor, true to her word, had shown no signs of expecting Lily\r\nat the bridge-table, and had even hinted to the other card-players\r\nthat they were to betray no surprise at her unwonted defection. In\r\nconsequence of this hint, Lily found herself the centre of that\r\nfeminine solicitude which envelops a young woman in the mating\r\nseason. A solitude was tacitly created for her in the crowded\r\nexistence of Bellomont, and her friends could not have shown a\r\ngreater readiness for self-effacement had her wooing been adorned\r\nwith all the attributes of romance. In Lily\xe2\x80\x99s set this conduct\r\nimplied a sympathetic comprehension of her motives, and Mr. Gryce\r\nrose in her esteem as she saw the consideration he inspired.\r\n\r\nThe terrace at Bellomont on a September afternoon was a spot\r\npropitious to sentimental musings, and as Miss Bart stood leaning\r\nagainst the balustrade above the sunken garden, at a little\r\ndistance from the animated group about the tea-table, she might\r\nhave been lost in the mazes of an inarticulate happiness. In\r\nreality, her thoughts were finding definite utterance in the\r\ntranquil recapitulation of the blessings in store for her. From\r\nwhere she stood she could see them embodied in the form of Mr.\r\nGryce, who, in a light overcoat and muffler, sat somewhat nervously\r\non the edge of his chair, while Carry Fisher, with all the energy\r\nof eye and gesture with which nature and art had combined to\r\nendow her, pressed on him the duty of taking part in the task of\r\nmunicipal reform.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s latest hobby was municipal reform. It had been\r\npreceded by an equal zeal for socialism, which had in turn replaced\r\nan energetic advocacy of Christian Science. Mrs. Fisher was\r\nsmall, fiery and dramatic; and her hands and eyes were admirable\r\ninstruments in the service of whatever causes she happened to\r\nespouse. She had, however, the fault common to enthusiasts of\r\nignoring any slackness of response on the part of her hearers, and\r\nLily was amused by her unconsciousness of the resistance displayed\r\nin every angle of Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s attitude. Lily herself knew that\r\nhis mind was divided between the dread of catching cold if he\r\nremained out of doors too long at that hour, and the fear that, if\r\nhe retreated to the house, Mrs. Fisher might follow him up with a\r\npaper to be signed. Mr. Gryce had a constitutional dislike to what\r\nhe called \xe2\x80\x9ccommitting himself,\xe2\x80\x9d and tenderly as he cherished his\r\nhealth, he evidently concluded that it was safer to stay out of\r\nreach of pen and ink till chance released him from Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoils. Meanwhile he cast agonized glances in the direction of Miss\r\nBart, whose only response was to sink into an attitude of more\r\ngraceful abstraction. She had learned the value of contrast in\r\nthrowing her charms into relief, and was fully aware of the extent\r\nto which Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s volubility was enhancing her own repose.\r\n\r\nShe was roused from her musings by the approach of her cousin Jack\r\nStepney who, at Gwen Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s side, was returning across the\r\ngarden from the tennis court.\r\n\r\nThe couple in question were engaged in the same kind of romance\r\nin which Lily figured, and the latter felt a certain annoyance in\r\ncontemplating what seemed to her a caricature of her own situation.\r\nMiss Van Osburgh was a large girl with flat surfaces and no high\r\nlights: Jack Stepney had once said of her that she was as reliable\r\nas roast mutton. His own taste was in the line of less solid and\r\nmore highly-seasoned diet; but hunger makes any fare palatable, and\r\nthere had been times when Mr. Stepney had been reduced to a crust.\r\n\r\nLily considered with interest the expression of their faces: the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s turned toward her companion\xe2\x80\x99s like an empty plate held up to\r\nbe filled, while the man lounging at her side already betrayed the\r\nencroaching boredom which would presently crack the thin veneer of\r\nhis smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow impatient men are!\xe2\x80\x9d Lily reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cAll Jack has to do to get\r\neverything he wants is to keep quiet and let that girl marry him;\r\nwhereas I have to calculate and contrive, and retreat and advance,\r\nas if I were going through an intricate dance, where one misstep\r\nwould throw me hopelessly out of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer she was whimsically struck by a kind of family\r\nlikeness between Miss Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce. There was no\r\nresemblance of feature. Gryce was handsome in a didactic way\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nlooked like a clever pupil\xe2\x80\x99s drawing from a plaster-cast\xe2\x80\x94while\r\nGwen\xe2\x80\x99s countenance had no more modelling than a face painted on\r\na toy balloon. But the deeper affinity was unmistakable: the two\r\nhad the same prejudices and ideals, and the same quality of making\r\nother standards non-existent by ignoring them. This attribute was\r\ncommon to most of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s set: they had a force of negation which\r\neliminated everything beyond their own range of perception. Gryce\r\nand Miss Van Osburgh were, in short, made for each other by every\r\nlaw of moral and physical correspondence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYet they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nat each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily mused, \xe2\x80\x9cthey never do. Each of them wants a\r\ncreature of a different race, of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s race and mine, with all\r\nsorts of intuitions, sensations and perceptions that they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neven guess the existence of. And they always get what they want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood talking with her cousin and Miss Van Osburgh, till a\r\nslight cloud on the latter\xe2\x80\x99s brow advised her that even cousinly\r\namenities were subject to suspicion, and Miss Bart, mindful of the\r\nnecessity of not exciting enmities at this crucial point of her\r\ncareer, dropped aside while the happy couple proceeded toward the\r\ntea-table.\r\n\r\nSeating herself on the upper step of the terrace, Lily leaned\r\nher head against the honeysuckles wreathing the balustrade. The\r\nfragrance of the late blossoms seemed an emanation of the tranquil\r\nscene, a landscape tutored to the last degree of rural elegance.\r\nIn the foreground glowed the warm tints of the gardens. Beyond the\r\nlawn, with its pyramidal pale-gold maples and velvety firs, sloped\r\npastures dotted with cattle; and through a long glade the river\r\nwidened like a lake under the silver light of September. Lily did\r\nnot want to join the circle about the tea-table. They represented\r\nthe future she had chosen, and she was content with it, but in no\r\nhaste to anticipate its joys. The certainty that she could marry\r\nPercy Gryce when she pleased had lifted a heavy load from her\r\nmind, and her money troubles were too recent for their removal not\r\nto leave a sense of relief which a less discerning intelligence\r\nmight have taken for happiness. Her vulgar cares were at an end.\r\nShe would be able to arrange her life as she pleased, to soar\r\ninto that empyrean of security where creditors cannot penetrate.\r\nShe would have smarter gowns than Judy Trenor, and far, far more\r\njewels than Bertha Dorset. She would be free forever from the\r\nshifts, the expedients, the humiliations of the relatively poor.\r\nInstead of having to flatter, she would be flattered; instead of\r\nbeing grateful, she would receive thanks. There were old scores\r\nshe could pay off as well as old benefits she could return. And\r\nshe had no doubts as to the extent of her power. She knew that Mr.\r\nGryce was of the small chary type most inaccessible to impulses\r\nand emotions. He had the kind of character in which prudence is\r\na vice, and good advice the most dangerous nourishment. But Lily\r\nhad known the species before: she was aware that such a guarded\r\nnature must find one huge outlet of egoism, and she determined to\r\nbe to him what his Americana had hitherto been: the one possession\r\nin which he took sufficient pride to spend money on it. She knew\r\nthat this generosity to self is one of the forms of meanness, and\r\nshe resolved so to identify herself with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s vanity that\r\nto gratify her wishes would be to him the most exquisite form of\r\nself-indulgence. The system might at first necessitate a resort\r\nto some of the very shifts and expedients from which she intended\r\nit should free her; but she felt sure that in a short time she\r\nwould be able to play the game in her own way. How should she have\r\ndistrusted her powers? Her beauty itself was not the mere ephemeral\r\npossession it might have been in the hands of inexperience: her\r\nskill in enhancing it, the care she took of it, the use she made\r\nof it, seemed to give it a kind of permanence. She felt she could\r\ntrust it to carry her through to the end.\r\n\r\nAnd the end, on the whole, was worthwhile. Life was not the mockery\r\nshe had thought it three days ago. There was room for her, after\r\nall, in this crowded selfish world of pleasure whence, so short a\r\ntime since, her poverty had seemed to exclude her. These people\r\nwhom she had ridiculed and yet envied were glad to make a place for\r\nher in the charmed circle about which all her desires revolved.\r\nThey were not as brutal and self-engrossed as she had fancied\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nrather, since it would no longer be necessary to flatter and humour\r\nthem, that side of their nature became less conspicuous. Society is\r\na revolving body which is apt to be judged according to its place\r\nin each man\xe2\x80\x99s heaven; and at present it was turning its illuminated\r\nface to Lily.\r\n\r\nIn the rosy glow it diffused her companions seemed full of amiable\r\nqualities. She liked their elegance, their lightness, their lack\r\nof emphasis: even the self-assurance which at times was so like\r\nobtuseness now seemed the natural sign of social ascendency. They\r\nwere lords of the only world she cared for, and they were ready to\r\nadmit her to their ranks and let her lord it with them. Already\r\nshe felt within her a stealing allegiance to their standards, an\r\nacceptance of their limitations, a disbelief in the things they did\r\nnot believe in, a contemptuous pity for the people who were not\r\nable to live as they lived.\r\n\r\nThe early sunset was slanting across the park. Through the boughs\r\nof the long avenue beyond the gardens she caught the flash of\r\nwheels, and divined that more visitors were approaching. There\r\nwas a movement behind her, a scattering of steps and voices:\r\nit was evident that the party about the tea-table was breaking\r\nup. Presently she heard a tread behind her on the terrace. She\r\nsupposed that Mr. Gryce had at last found means to escape from his\r\npredicament, and she smiled at the significance of his coming to\r\njoin her instead of beating an instant retreat to the fireside.\r\n\r\nShe turned to give him the welcome which such gallantry deserved;\r\nbut her greeting wavered into a blush of wonder, for the man who\r\nhad approached her was Lawrence Selden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I came after all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; but before she had time\r\nto answer, Mrs. Dorset, breaking away from a lifeless colloquy\r\nwith her host, had stepped between them with a little gesture of\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observance of Sunday at Bellomont was chiefly marked by the\r\npunctual appearance of the smart omnibus destined to convey the\r\nhousehold to the little church at the gates. Whether any one got\r\ninto the omnibus or not was a matter of secondary importance,\r\nsince by standing there it not only bore witness to the orthodox\r\nintentions of the family, but made Mrs. Trenor feel, when she\r\nfinally heard it drive away, that she had somehow vicariously made\r\nuse of it.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s theory that her daughters actually did go\r\nto church every Sunday; but their French governess\xe2\x80\x99s convictions\r\ncalling her to the rival fane, and the fatigues of the week keeping\r\ntheir mother in her room till luncheon, there was seldom any one\r\npresent to verify the fact. Now and then, in a spasmodic burst of\r\nvirtue\xe2\x80\x94when the house had been too uproarious over night\xe2\x80\x94Gus Trenor\r\nforced his genial bulk into a tight frock-coat and routed his\r\ndaughters from their slumbers; but habitually, as Lily explained to\r\nMr. Gryce, this parental duty was forgotten till the church bells\r\nwere ringing across the park, and the omnibus had driven away empty.\r\n\r\nLily had hinted to Mr. Gryce that this neglect of religious\r\nobservances was repugnant to her early traditions, and that during\r\nher visits to Bellomont she regularly accompanied Muriel and Hilda\r\nto church. This tallied with the assurance, also confidentially\r\nimparted, that, never having played bridge before, she had been\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdragged into it\xe2\x80\x9d on the night of her arrival, and had lost an\r\nappalling amount of money in consequence of her ignorance of\r\nthe game and of the rules of betting. Mr. Gryce was undoubtedly\r\nenjoying Bellomont. He liked the ease and glitter of the life, and\r\nthe lustre conferred on him by being a member of this group of rich\r\nand conspicuous people. But he thought it a very materialistic\r\nsociety; there were times when he was frightened by the talk of the\r\nmen and the looks of the ladies, and he was glad to find that Miss\r\nBart, for all her ease and self-possession, was not at home in so\r\nambiguous an atmosphere. For this reason he had been especially\r\npleased to learn that she would, as usual, attend the young Trenors\r\nto church on Sunday morning; and as he paced the gravel sweep\r\nbefore the door, his light overcoat on his arm and his prayer-book\r\nin one carefully-gloved hand, he reflected agreeably on the\r\nstrength of character which kept her true to her early training in\r\nsurroundings so subversive to religious principles.\r\n\r\nFor a long time Mr. Gryce and the omnibus had the gravel sweep to\r\nthemselves; but, far from regretting this deplorable indifference\r\non the part of the other guests, he found himself nourishing the\r\nhope that Miss Bart might be unaccompanied. The precious minutes\r\nwere flying, however; the big chestnuts pawed the ground and\r\nflecked their impatient sides with foam; the coachman seemed to be\r\nslowly petrifying on the box, and the groom on the doorstep; and\r\nstill the lady did not come. Suddenly, however, there was a sound\r\nof voices and a rustle of skirts in the doorway, and Mr. Gryce,\r\nrestoring his watch to his pocket, turned with a nervous start;\r\nbut it was only to find himself handing Mrs. Wetherall into the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nThe Wetheralls always went to church. They belonged to the vast\r\ngroup of human automata who go through life without neglecting to\r\nperform a single one of the gestures executed by the surrounding\r\npuppets. It is true that the Bellomont puppets did not go to\r\nchurch; but others equally important did\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWetherall\xe2\x80\x99s circle was so large that God was included in their\r\nvisiting-list. They appeared, therefore, punctual and resigned,\r\nwith the air of people bound for a dull \xe2\x80\x9cAt Home,\xe2\x80\x9d and after them\r\nHilda and Muriel straggled, yawning and pinning each other\xe2\x80\x99s veils\r\nand ribbons as they came. They had promised Lily to go to church\r\nwith her, they declared, and Lily was such a dear old duck that\r\nthey didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind doing it to please her, though they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfancy what had put the idea in her head, and though for their own\r\npart they would much rather have played lawn tennis with Jack and\r\nGwen, if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told them she was coming. The Misses Trenor\r\nwere followed by Lady Cressida Raith, a weather-beaten person in\r\nLiberty silk and ethnological trinkets, who, on seeing the omnibus,\r\nexpressed her surprise that they were not to walk across the park;\r\nbut at Mrs. Wetherall\xe2\x80\x99s horrified protest that the church was\r\na mile away, her ladyship, after a glance at the height of the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s heels, acquiesced in the necessity of driving, and poor\r\nMr. Gryce found himself rolling off between four ladies for whose\r\nspiritual welfare he felt not the least concern.\r\n\r\nIt might have afforded him some consolation could he have known\r\nthat Miss Bart had really meant to go to church. She had even risen\r\nearlier than usual in the execution of her purpose. She had an idea\r\nthat the sight of her in a grey gown of devotional cut, with her\r\nfamous lashes drooped above a prayer-book, would put the finishing\r\ntouch to Mr. Gryce\xe2\x80\x99s subjugation, and render inevitable a certain\r\nincident which she had resolved should form a part of the walk they\r\nwere to take together after luncheon. Her intentions in short had\r\nnever been more definite; but poor Lily, for all the hard glaze of\r\nher exterior, was inwardly as malleable as wax. Her faculty for\r\nadapting herself, for entering into other people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, if it\r\nserved her now and then in small contingencies, hampered her in the\r\ndecisive moments of life. She was like a water-plant in the flux\r\nof the tides, and today the whole current of her mood was carrying\r\nher toward Lawrence Selden. Why had he come? Was it to see herself\r\nor Bertha Dorset? It was the last question which, at that moment,\r\nshould have engaged her. She might better have contented herself\r\nwith thinking that he had simply responded to the despairing\r\nsummons of his hostess, anxious to interpose him between herself\r\nand the ill-humour of Mrs. Dorset. But Lily had not rested till she\r\nlearned from Mrs. Trenor that Selden had come of his own accord.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t even wire me\xe2\x80\x94he just happened to find the trap at the\r\nstation. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not over with Bertha after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Trenor\r\nmusingly concluded; and went away to arrange her dinner-cards\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not, Lily reflected; but it should be soon, unless\r\nshe had lost her cunning. If Selden had come at Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s call,\r\nit was at her own that he would stay. So much the previous evening\r\nhad told her. Mrs. Trenor, true to her simple principle of making\r\nher married friends happy, had placed Selden and Mrs. Dorset next\r\nto each other at dinner; but, in obedience to the time-honoured\r\ntraditions of the match-maker, she had separated Lily and Mr.\r\nGryce, sending in the former with George Dorset, while Mr. Gryce\r\nwas coupled with Gwen Van Osburgh.\r\n\r\nGeorge Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s talk did not interfere with the range of his\r\nneighbour\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. He was a mournful dyspeptic, intent on\r\nfinding out the deleterious ingredients of every dish and diverted\r\nfrom this care only by the sound of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s voice. On this\r\noccasion, however, Mrs. Dorset took no part in the general\r\nconversation. She sat talking in low murmurs with Selden, and\r\nturning a contemptuous and denuded shoulder toward her host, who,\r\nfar from resenting his exclusion, plunged into the excesses of\r\nthe MENU with the joyous irresponsibility of a free man. To Mr.\r\nDorset, however, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was a subject of such evident\r\nconcern that, when he was not scraping the sauce from his fish, or\r\nscooping the moist bread-crumbs from the interior of his roll, he\r\nsat straining his thin neck for a glimpse of her between the lights.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor, as it chanced, had placed the husband and wife on\r\nopposite sides of the table, and Lily was therefore able to observe\r\nMrs. Dorset also, and by carrying her glance a few feet farther, to\r\nset up a rapid comparison between Lawrence Selden and Mr. Gryce.\r\nIt was that comparison which was her undoing. Why else had she\r\nsuddenly grown interested in Selden? She had known him for eight\r\nyears or more: ever since her return to America he had formed a\r\npart of her background. She had always been glad to sit next to\r\nhim at dinner, had found him more agreeable than most men, and had\r\nvaguely wished that he possessed the other qualities needful to\r\nfix her attention; but till now she had been too busy with her own\r\naffairs to regard him as more than one of the pleasant accessories\r\nof life. Miss Bart was a keen reader of her own heart, and she saw\r\nthat her sudden preoccupation with Selden was due to the fact that\r\nhis presence shed a new light on her surroundings. Not that he was\r\nnotably brilliant or exceptional; in his own profession he was\r\nsurpassed by more than one man who had bored Lily through many a\r\nweary dinner. It was rather that he had preserved a certain social\r\ndetachment, a happy air of viewing the show objectively, of having\r\npoints of contact outside the great gilt cage in which they were\r\nall huddled for the mob to gape at. How alluring the world outside\r\nthe cage appeared to Lily, as she heard its door clang on her! In\r\nreality, as she knew, the door never clanged: it stood always open;\r\nbut most of the captives were like flies in a bottle, and having\r\nonce flown in, could never regain their freedom. It was Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndistinction that he had never forgotten the way out.\r\n\r\nThat was the secret of his way of readjusting her vision. Lily,\r\nturning her eyes from him, found herself scanning her little world\r\nthrough his retina: it was as though the pink lamps had been shut\r\noff and the dusty daylight let in. She looked down the long table,\r\nstudying its occupants one by one, from Gus Trenor, with his\r\nheavy carnivorous head sunk between his shoulders, as he preyed\r\non a jellied plover, to his wife, at the opposite end of the long\r\nbank of orchids, suggestive, with her glaring good-looks, of a\r\njeweller\xe2\x80\x99s window lit by electricity. And between the two, what a\r\nlong stretch of vacuity! How dreary and trivial these people were!\r\nLily reviewed them with a scornful impatience: Carry Fisher, with\r\nher shoulders, her eyes, her divorces, her general air of embodying\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cspicy paragraph\xe2\x80\x9d; young Silverton, who had meant to live on\r\nproof-reading and write an epic, and who now lived on his friends\r\nand had become critical of truffles; Alice Wetherall, an animated\r\nvisiting-list, whose most fervid convictions turned on the wording\r\nof invitations and the engraving of dinner-cards; Wetherall, with\r\nhis perpetual nervous nod of acquiescence, his air of agreeing with\r\npeople before he knew what they were saying; Jack Stepney, with his\r\nconfident smile and anxious eyes, half way between the sheriff and\r\nan heiress; Gwen Van Osburgh, with all the guileless confidence of\r\na young girl who has always been told that there is no one richer\r\nthan her father.\r\n\r\nLily smiled at her classification of her friends. How different\r\nthey had seemed to her a few hours ago! Then they had symbolized\r\nwhat she was gaining, now they stood for what she was giving\r\nup. That very afternoon they had seemed full of brilliant\r\nqualities; now she saw that they were merely dull in a loud way.\r\nUnder the glitter of their opportunities she saw the poverty\r\nof their achievement. It was not that she wanted them to be\r\nmore disinterested; but she would have liked them to be more\r\npicturesque. And she had a shamed recollection of the way in which,\r\na few hours since, she had felt the centripetal force of their\r\nstandards. She closed her eyes an instant, and the vacuous routine\r\nof the life she had chosen stretched before her like a long white\r\nroad without dip or turning: it was true she was to roll over it\r\nin a carriage instead of trudging it on foot, but sometimes the\r\npedestrian enjoys the diversion of a short cut which is denied to\r\nthose on wheels.\r\n\r\nShe was roused by a chuckle which Mr. Dorset seemed to eject from\r\nthe depths of his lean throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, do look at her,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, turning to Miss Bart with\r\nlugubrious merriment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, but do just look at my\r\nwife making a fool of that poor devil over there! One would really\r\nsuppose she was gone on him\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s all the other way round, I\r\nassure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus adjured, Lily turned her eyes on the spectacle which was\r\naffording Mr. Dorset such legitimate mirth. It certainly appeared,\r\nas he said, that Mrs. Dorset was the more active participant in\r\nthe scene: her neighbour seemed to receive her advances with a\r\ntemperate zest which did not distract him from his dinner. The\r\nsight restored Lily\xe2\x80\x99s good humour, and knowing the peculiar\r\ndisguise which Mr. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s marital fears assumed, she asked gaily:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you horribly jealous of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDorset greeted the sally with delight. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, abominably\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\njust hit it\xe2\x80\x94keeps me awake at night. The doctors tell me that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat has knocked my digestion out\xe2\x80\x94being so infernally jealous of\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat a mouthful of this stuff, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added\r\nsuddenly, pushing back his plate with a clouded countenance;\r\nand Lily, unfailingly adaptable, accorded her radiant attention\r\nto his prolonged denunciation of other people\xe2\x80\x99s cooks, with a\r\nsupplementary tirade on the toxic qualities of melted butter.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that he found so ready an ear; and, being a man\r\nas well as a dyspeptic, it may be that as he poured his grievances\r\ninto it he was not insensible to its rosy symmetry. At any rate he\r\nengaged Lily so long that the sweets were being handed when she\r\ncaught a phrase on her other side, where Miss Corby, the comic\r\nwoman of the company, was bantering Jack Stepney on his approaching\r\nengagement. Miss Corby\xe2\x80\x99s role was jocularity: she always entered\r\nthe conversation with a handspring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll have Sim Rosedale as best man!\xe2\x80\x9d Lily heard\r\nher fling out as the climax of her prognostications; and Stepney\r\nresponded, as if struck: \xe2\x80\x9cJove, that\xe2\x80\x99s an idea. What a thumping\r\npresent I\xe2\x80\x99d get out of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSIM ROSEDALE! The name, made more odious by its diminutive,\r\nobtruded itself on Lily\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts like a leer. It stood for one\r\nof the many hated possibilities hovering on the edge of life. If\r\nshe did not marry Percy Gryce, the day might come when she would\r\nhave to be civil to such men as Rosedale. IF SHE DID NOT MARRY\r\nHIM? But she meant to marry him\xe2\x80\x94she was sure of him and sure of\r\nherself. She drew back with a shiver from the pleasant paths in\r\nwhich her thoughts had been straying, and set her feet once more in\r\nthe middle of the long white road.... When she went upstairs that\r\nnight she found that the late post had brought her a fresh batch of\r\nbills. Mrs. Peniston, who was a conscientious woman, had forwarded\r\nthem all to Bellomont.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Bart, accordingly, rose the next morning with the most earnest\r\nconviction that it was her duty to go to church. She tore herself\r\nbetimes from the lingering enjoyment of her breakfast tray, rang to\r\nhave her grey gown laid out, and despatched her maid to borrow a\r\nprayer-book from Mrs. Trenor.\r\n\r\nBut her course was too purely reasonable not to contain the germs\r\nof rebellion. No sooner were her preparations made than they roused\r\na smothered sense of resistance. A small spark was enough to\r\nkindle Lily\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, and the sight of the grey dress and the\r\nborrowed prayer-book flashed a long light down the years. She would\r\nhave to go to church with Percy Gryce every Sunday. They would have\r\na front pew in the most expensive church in New York, and his name\r\nwould figure handsomely in the list of parish charities. In a few\r\nyears, when he grew stouter, he would be made a warden. Once in the\r\nwinter the rector would come to dine, and her husband would beg\r\nher to go over the list and see that no DIVORCEES were included,\r\nexcept those who had showed signs of penitence by being re-married\r\nto the very wealthy. There was nothing especially arduous in this\r\nround of religious obligations; but it stood for a fraction of that\r\ngreat bulk of boredom which loomed across her path. And who could\r\nconsent to be bored on such a morning? Lily had slept well, and\r\nher bath had filled her with a pleasant glow, which was becomingly\r\nreflected in the clear curve of her cheek. No lines were visible\r\nthis morning, or else the glass was at a happier angle.\r\n\r\nAnd the day was the accomplice of her mood: it was a day for\r\nimpulse and truancy. The light air seemed full of powdered gold;\r\nbelow the dewy bloom of the lawns the woodlands blushed and\r\nsmouldered, and the hills across the river swam in molten blue.\r\nEvery drop of blood in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s veins invited her to happiness.\r\n\r\nThe sound of wheels roused her from these musings, and leaning\r\nbehind her shutters she saw the omnibus take up its freight. She\r\nwas too late, then\xe2\x80\x94but the fact did not alarm her. A glimpse of Mr.\r\nGryce\xe2\x80\x99s crestfallen face even suggested that she had done wisely\r\nin absenting herself, since the disappointment he so candidly\r\nbetrayed would surely whet his appetite for the afternoon walk.\r\nThat walk she did not mean to miss; one glance at the bills on her\r\nwriting-table was enough to recall its necessity. But meanwhile\r\nshe had the morning to herself, and could muse pleasantly on the\r\ndisposal of its hours. She was familiar enough with the habits of\r\nBellomont to know that she was likely to have a free field till\r\nluncheon. She had seen the Wetheralls, the Trenor girls and Lady\r\nCressida packed safely into the omnibus; Judy Trenor was sure to\r\nbe having her hair shampooed; Carry Fisher had doubtless carried\r\noff her host for a drive; Ned Silverton was probably smoking\r\nthe cigarette of young despair in his bedroom; and Kate Corby\r\nwas certain to be playing tennis with Jack Stepney and Miss Van\r\nOsburgh. Of the ladies, this left only Mrs. Dorset unaccounted for,\r\nand Mrs. Dorset never came down till luncheon: her doctors, she\r\naverred, had forbidden her to expose herself to the crude air of\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nTo the remaining members of the party Lily gave no special thought;\r\nwherever they were, they were not likely to interfere with her\r\nplans. These, for the moment, took the shape of assuming a dress\r\nsomewhat more rustic and summerlike in style than the garment she\r\nhad first selected, and rustling downstairs, sunshade in hand, with\r\nthe disengaged air of a lady in quest of exercise. The great hall\r\nwas empty but for the knot of dogs by the fire, who, taking in at\r\na glance the outdoor aspect of Miss Bart, were upon her at once\r\nwith lavish offers of companionship. She put aside the ramming paws\r\nwhich conveyed these offers, and assuring the joyous volunteers\r\nthat she might presently have a use for their company, sauntered\r\non through the empty drawing-room to the library at the end of the\r\nhouse. The library was almost the only surviving portion of the\r\nold manor-house of Bellomont: a long spacious room, revealing the\r\ntraditions of the mother-country in its classically-cased doors,\r\nthe Dutch tiles of the chimney, and the elaborate hob-grate with\r\nits shining brass urns. A few family portraits of lantern-jawed\r\ngentlemen in tie-wigs, and ladies with large head-dresses and small\r\nbodies, hung between the shelves lined with pleasantly-shabby\r\nbooks: books mostly contemporaneous with the ancestors in question,\r\nand to which the subsequent Trenors had made no perceptible\r\nadditions. The library at Bellomont was in fact never used for\r\nreading, though it had a certain popularity as a smoking room or\r\na quiet retreat for flirtation. It had occurred to Lily, however,\r\nthat it might on this occasion have been resorted to by the only\r\nmember of the party in the least likely to put it to its original\r\nuse. She advanced noiselessly over the dense old rug scattered\r\nwith easy-chairs, and before she reached the middle of the room\r\nshe saw that she had not been mistaken. Lawrence Selden was in\r\nfact seated at its farther end; but though a book lay on his knee,\r\nhis attention was not engaged with it, but directed to a lady\r\nwhose lace-clad figure, as she leaned back in an adjoining chair,\r\ndetached itself with exaggerated slimness against the dusky leather\r\nupholstery.\r\n\r\nLily paused as she caught sight of the group; for a moment she\r\nseemed about to withdraw, but thinking better of this, she\r\nannounced her approach by a slight shake of her skirts which made\r\nthe couple raise their heads, Mrs. Dorset with a look of frank\r\ndispleasure, and Selden with his usual quiet smile. The sight of\r\nhis composure had a disturbing effect on Lily; but to be disturbed\r\nwas in her case to make a more brilliant effort at self-possession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, am I late?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, putting a hand in his as he\r\nadvanced to greet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate for what?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Mrs. Dorset tartly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot for luncheon,\r\ncertainly\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps you had an earlier engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lily confidingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Perhaps I am in the way, then? But Mr. Selden is entirely\r\nat your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Dorset was pale with temper, and her\r\nantagonist felt a certain pleasure in prolonging her distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear, no\xe2\x80\x94do stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t in the\r\nleast want to drive you away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re awfully good, dear, but I never interfere with Mr. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nengagements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe remark was uttered with a little air of proprietorship not lost\r\non its object, who concealed a faint blush of annoyance by stooping\r\nto pick up the book he had dropped at Lily\xe2\x80\x99s approach. The latter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes widened charmingly and she broke into a light laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have no engagement with Mr. Selden! My engagement was to go\r\nto church; and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid the omnibus has started without me. HAS\r\nit started, do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to Selden, who replied that he had heard it drive away\r\nsome time since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then I shall have to walk; I promised Hilda and Muriel to go\r\nto church with them. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to walk there, you say? Well, I\r\nshall have the credit of trying, at any rate\xe2\x80\x94and the advantage of\r\nescaping part of the service. I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sorry for myself, after\r\nall!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a bright nod to the couple on whom she had intruded, Miss\r\nBart strolled through the glass doors and carried her rustling\r\ngrace down the long perspective of the garden walk.\r\n\r\nShe was taking her way churchward, but at no very quick pace; a\r\nfact not lost on one of her observers, who stood in the doorway\r\nlooking after her with an air of puzzled amusement. The truth is\r\nthat she was conscious of a somewhat keen shock of disappointment.\r\nAll her plans for the day had been built on the assumption that it\r\nwas to see her that Selden had come to Bellomont. She had expected,\r\nwhen she came downstairs, to find him on the watch for her; and\r\nshe had found him, instead, in a situation which might well denote\r\nthat he had been on the watch for another lady. Was it possible,\r\nafter all, that he had come for Bertha Dorset? The latter had\r\nacted on the assumption to the extent of appearing at an hour when\r\nshe never showed herself to ordinary mortals, and Lily, for the\r\nmoment, saw no way of putting her in the wrong. It did not occur\r\nto her that Selden might have been actuated merely by the desire\r\nto spend a Sunday out of town: women never learn to dispense with\r\nthe sentimental motive in their judgments of men. But Lily was not\r\neasily disconcerted; competition put her on her mettle, and she\r\nreflected that Selden\xe2\x80\x99s coming, if it did not declare him to be\r\nstill in Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s toils, showed him to be so completely free\r\nfrom them that he was not afraid of her proximity.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts so engaged her that she fell into a gait hardly\r\nlikely to carry her to church before the sermon, and at length,\r\nhaving passed from the gardens to the wood-path beyond, so far\r\nforgot her intention as to sink into a rustic seat at a bend of the\r\nwalk. The spot was charming, and Lily was not insensible to the\r\ncharm, or to the fact that her presence enhanced it; but she was\r\nnot accustomed to taste the joys of solitude except in company,\r\nand the combination of a handsome girl and a romantic scene struck\r\nher as too good to be wasted. No one, however, appeared to profit\r\nby the opportunity; and after a half hour of fruitless waiting she\r\nrose and wandered on. She felt a stealing sense of fatigue as she\r\nwalked; the sparkle had died out of her, and the taste of life\r\nwas stale on her lips. She hardly knew what she had been seeking,\r\nor why the failure to find it had so blotted the light from her\r\nsky: she was only aware of a vague sense of failure, of an inner\r\nisolation deeper than the loneliness about her.\r\n\r\nHer footsteps flagged, and she stood gazing listlessly ahead,\r\ndigging the ferny edge of the path with the tip of her sunshade.\r\nAs she did so a step sounded behind her, and she saw Selden at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fast you walk!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I should never catch\r\nup with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered gaily: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be quite breathless! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nsitting under that tree for an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting for me, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined; and she said with a vague\r\nlaugh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94waiting to see if you would come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seize the distinction, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, since doing the one\r\ninvolved doing the other. But weren\xe2\x80\x99t you sure that I should come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I waited long enough\xe2\x80\x94but you see I had only a limited time to\r\ngive to the experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy limited? Limited by luncheon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; by my other engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour engagement to go to church with Muriel and Hilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but to come home from church with another person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see; I might have known you were fully provided with\r\nalternatives. And is the other person coming home this way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; and to find\r\nout, it is my business to get to church before the service is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; and it is my business to prevent your doing so; in which\r\ncase the other person, piqued by your absence, will form the\r\ndesperate resolve of driving back in the omnibus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily received this with fresh appreciation; his nonsense was like\r\nthe bubbling of her inner mood. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you would do in such\r\nan emergency?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired.\r\n\r\nSelden looked at her with solemnity. \xe2\x80\x9cI am here to prove to you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I am capable of doing in an emergency!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalking a mile in an hour\xe2\x80\x94you must own that the omnibus would be\r\nquicker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94but will he find you in the end? That\xe2\x80\x99s the only test of\r\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other with the same luxury of enjoyment that\r\nthey had felt in exchanging absurdities over his tea-table; but\r\nsuddenly Lily\xe2\x80\x99s face changed, and she said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it is, he has\r\nsucceeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden, following her glance, perceived a party of people advancing\r\ntoward them from the farther bend of the path. Lady Cressida\r\nhad evidently insisted on walking home, and the rest of the\r\nchurch-goers had thought it their duty to accompany her. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion looked rapidly from one to the other of the two men of\r\nthe party; Wetherall walking respectfully at Lady Cressida\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\nwith his little sidelong look of nervous attention, and Percy Gryce\r\nbringing-up the rear with Mrs. Wetherall and the Trenors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94now I see why you were getting up your Americana!\xe2\x80\x9d Selden\r\nexclaimed with a note of the freest admiration but the blush with\r\nwhich the sally was received checked whatever amplifications he had\r\nmeant to give it.\r\n\r\nThat Lily Bart should object to being bantered about her suitors,\r\nor even about her means of attracting them, was so new to Selden\r\nthat he had a momentary flash of surprise, which lit up a number\r\nof possibilities; but she rose gallantly to the defence of her\r\nconfusion, by saying, as its object approached: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was why I was\r\nwaiting for you\xe2\x80\x94to thank you for having given me so many points!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you can hardly do justice to the subject in such a short\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selden, as the Trenor girls caught sight of Miss Bart;\r\nand while she signalled a response to their boisterous greeting, he\r\nadded quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you devote your afternoon to it? You know I\r\nmust be off tomorrow morning. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take a walk, and you can thank\r\nme at your leisure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was perfect. A deeper stillness possessed the air,\r\nand the glitter of the American autumn was tempered by a haze which\r\ndiffused the brightness without dulling it.\r\n\r\nIn the woody hollows of the park there was already a faint chill;\r\nbut as the ground rose the air grew lighter, and ascending the long\r\nslopes beyond the high-road, Lily and her companion reached a zone\r\nof lingering summer. The path wound across a meadow with scattered\r\ntrees; then it dipped into a lane plumed with asters and purpling\r\nsprays of bramble, whence, through the light quiver of ash-leaves,\r\nthe country unrolled itself in pastoral distances.\r\n\r\nHigher up, the lane showed thickening tufts of fern and of the\r\ncreeping glossy verdure of shaded slopes; trees began to overhang\r\nit, and the shade deepened to the checkered dusk of a beech-grove.\r\nThe boles of the trees stood well apart, with only a light\r\nfeathering of undergrowth; the path wound along the edge of the\r\nwood, now and then looking out on a sunlit pasture or on an orchard\r\nspangled with fruit.\r\n\r\nLily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for\r\nthe appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which\r\nwas the fitting background of her own sensations. The landscape\r\noutspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and\r\nshe found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its\r\nlong free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered\r\nlike pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and\r\nhere and there the lingering green of an oak-grove. Two or three\r\nred farm-houses dozed under the apple-trees, and the white wooden\r\nspire of a village church showed beyond the shoulder of the hill;\r\nwhile far below, in a haze of dust, the high-road ran between the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us sit here,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden suggested, as they reached an open ledge\r\nof rock above which the beeches rose steeply between mossy boulders.\r\n\r\nLily dropped down on the rock, glowing with her long climb. She\r\nsat quiet, her lips parted by the stress of the ascent, her eyes\r\nwandering peacefully over the broken ranges of the landscape.\r\nSelden stretched himself on the grass at her feet, tilting his hat\r\nagainst the level sun-rays, and clasping his hands behind his head,\r\nwhich rested against the side of the rock. He had no wish to make\r\nher talk; her quick-breathing silence seemed a part of the general\r\nhush and harmony of things. In his own mind there was only a lazy\r\nsense of pleasure, veiling the sharp edges of sensation as the\r\nSeptember haze veiled the scene at their feet. But Lily, though her\r\nattitude was as calm as his, was throbbing inwardly with a rush of\r\nthoughts. There were in her at the moment two beings, one drawing\r\ndeep breaths of freedom and exhilaration, the other gasping for\r\nair in a little black prison-house of fears. But gradually the\r\ncaptive\xe2\x80\x99s gasps grew fainter, or the other paid less heed to them:\r\nthe horizon expanded, the air grew stronger, and the free spirit\r\nquivered for flight.\r\n\r\nShe could not herself have explained the sense of buoyancy which\r\nseemed to lift and swing her above the sun-suffused world at her\r\nfeet. Was it love, she wondered, or a mere fortuitous combination\r\nof happy thoughts and sensations? How much of it was owing to the\r\nspell of the perfect afternoon, the scent of the fading woods, the\r\nthought of the dulness she had fled from? Lily had no definite\r\nexperience by which to test the quality of her feelings. She had\r\nseveral times been in love with fortunes or careers, but only\r\nonce with a man. That was years ago, when she first came out, and\r\nhad been smitten with a romantic passion for a young gentleman\r\nnamed Herbert Melson, who had blue eyes and a little wave in\r\nhis hair. Mr. Melson, who was possessed of no other negotiable\r\nsecurities, had hastened to employ these in capturing the eldest\r\nMiss Van Osburgh: since then he had grown stout and wheezy, and was\r\ngiven to telling anecdotes about his children. If Lily recalled\r\nthis early emotion it was not to compare it with that which now\r\npossessed her; the only point of comparison was the sense of\r\nlightness, of emancipation, which she remembered feeling, in the\r\nwhirl of a waltz or the seclusion of a conservatory, during the\r\nbrief course of her youthful romance. She had not known again\r\ntill today that lightness, that glow of freedom; but now it was\r\nsomething more than a blind groping of the blood. The peculiar\r\ncharm of her feeling for Selden was that she understood it; she\r\ncould put her finger on every link of the chain that was drawing\r\nthem together. Though his popularity was of the quiet kind,\r\nfelt rather than actively expressed among his friends, she had\r\nnever mistaken his inconspicuousness for obscurity. His reputed\r\ncultivation was generally regarded as a slight obstacle to easy\r\nintercourse, but Lily, who prided herself on her broad-minded\r\nrecognition of literature, and always carried an Omar Khayam in\r\nher travelling-bag, was attracted by this attribute, which she\r\nfelt would have had its distinction in an older society. It was,\r\nmoreover, one of his gifts to look his part; to have a height which\r\nlifted his head above the crowd, and the keenly-modelled dark\r\nfeatures which, in a land of amorphous types, gave him the air of\r\nbelonging to a more specialized race, of carrying the impress of a\r\nconcentrated past. Expansive persons found him a little dry, and\r\nvery young girls thought him sarcastic; but this air of friendly\r\naloofness, as far removed as possible from any assertion of\r\npersonal advantage, was the quality which piqued Lily\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\r\nEverything about him accorded with the fastidious element in her\r\ntaste, even to the light irony with which he surveyed what seemed\r\nto her most sacred. She admired him most of all, perhaps, for being\r\nable to convey as distinct a sense of superiority as the richest\r\nman she had ever met.\r\n\r\nIt was the unconscious prolongation of this thought which led her\r\nto say presently, with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cI have broken two engagements for\r\nyou today. How many have you broken for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selden calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cMy only engagement at Bellomont was\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe glanced down at him, faintly smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you really come to Bellomont to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer look deepened meditatively. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, with an accent\r\nwhich took all tinge of coquetry from the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re such a wonderful spectacle: I always like to see\r\nwhat you are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know what I should be doing if you were not here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t flatter myself that my coming has deflected\r\nyour course of action by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s absurd\xe2\x80\x94since, if you were not here, I could obviously not\r\nbe taking a walk with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but your taking a walk with me is only another way of making\r\nuse of your material. You are an artist and I happen to be the bit\r\nof colour you are using today. It\xe2\x80\x99s a part of your cleverness to be\r\nable to produce premeditated effects extemporaneously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily smiled also: his words were too acute not to strike her sense\r\nof humour. It was true that she meant to use the accident of his\r\npresence as part of a very definite effect; or that, at least,\r\nwas the secret pretext she had found for breaking her promise to\r\nwalk with Mr. Gryce. She had sometimes been accused of being too\r\neager\xe2\x80\x94even Judy Trenor had warned her to go slowly. Well, she would\r\nnot be too eager in this case; she would give her suitor a longer\r\ntaste of suspense. Where duty and inclination jumped together, it\r\nwas not in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s nature to hold them asunder. She had excused\r\nherself from the walk on the plea of a headache: the horrid\r\nheadache which, in the morning, had prevented her venturing to\r\nchurch. Her appearance at luncheon justified the excuse. She looked\r\nlanguid, full of a suffering sweetness; she carried a scent-bottle\r\nin her hand. Mr. Gryce was new to such manifestations; he wondered\r\nrather nervously if she were delicate, having far-reaching fears\r\nabout the future of his progeny. But sympathy won the day, and he\r\nbesought her not to expose herself: he always connected the outer\r\nair with ideas of exposure.\r\n\r\nLily had received his sympathy with languid gratitude, urging him,\r\nsince she should be such poor company, to join the rest of the\r\nparty who, after luncheon, were starting in automobiles on a visit\r\nto the Van Osburghs at Peekskill. Mr. Gryce was touched by her\r\ndisinterestedness, and, to escape from the threatened vacuity of\r\nthe afternoon, had taken her advice and departed mournfully, in a\r\ndust-hood and goggles: as the motor-car plunged down the avenue she\r\nsmiled at his resemblance to a baffled beetle. Selden had watched\r\nher manoeuvres with lazy amusement. She had made no reply to his\r\nsuggestion that they should spend the afternoon together, but as\r\nher plan unfolded itself he felt fairly confident of being included\r\nin it. The house was empty when at length he heard her step on the\r\nstair and strolled out of the billiard-room to join her.\r\n\r\nShe had on a hat and walking-dress, and the dogs were bounding at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, after all, the air might do me good,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained;\r\nand he agreed that so simple a remedy was worth trying.\r\n\r\nThe excursionists would be gone at least four hours; Lily and\r\nSelden had the whole afternoon before them, and the sense of\r\nleisure and safety gave the last touch of lightness to her spirit.\r\nWith so much time to talk, and no definite object to be led up to,\r\nshe could taste the rare joys of mental vagrancy.\r\n\r\nShe felt so free from ulterior motives that she took up his charge\r\nwith a touch of resentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you are always accusing me of\r\npremeditation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you confessed to it: you told me the other day that you\r\nhad to follow a certain line\xe2\x80\x94and if one does a thing at all it is a\r\nmerit to do it thoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean that a girl who has no one to think for her is obliged\r\nto think for herself, I am quite willing to accept the imputation.\r\nBut you must find me a dismal kind of person if you suppose that I\r\nnever yield to an impulse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that: haven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you that your genius\r\nlies in converting impulses into intentions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy genius?\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed with a sudden note of weariness. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there\r\nany final test of genius but success? And I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsucceeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden pushed his hat back and took a side-glance at her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuccess\xe2\x80\x94what is success? I shall be interested to have your\r\ndefinition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuccess?\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to get as much as one can out of\r\nlife, I suppose. It\xe2\x80\x99s a relative quality, after all. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nyour idea of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy idea of it? God forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d He sat up with sudden energy, resting\r\nhis elbows on his knees and staring out upon the mellow fields. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nidea of success,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis personal freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom? Freedom from worries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom everything\xe2\x80\x94from money, from poverty, from ease and anxiety,\r\nfrom all the material accidents. To keep a kind of republic of the\r\nspirit\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward with a responsive flash. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrange; but that\xe2\x80\x99s just what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling today.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met her eyes with the latent sweetness of his. \xe2\x80\x9cIs the feeling\r\nso rare with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe blushed a little under his gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think me horribly sordid,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you? But perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s rather that I never had any choice.\r\nThere was no one, I mean, to tell me about the republic of the\r\nspirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere never is\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a country one has to find the way to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should never have found my way there if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there are sign-posts\xe2\x80\x94but one has to know how to read them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have known, I have known!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried with a glow of\r\neagerness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever I see you, I find myself spelling out a letter\r\nof the sign\xe2\x80\x94and yesterday\xe2\x80\x94last evening at dinner\xe2\x80\x94I suddenly saw a\r\nlittle way into your republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden was still looking at her, but with a changed eye. Hitherto\r\nhe had found, in her presence and her talk, the aesthetic amusement\r\nwhich a reflective man is apt to seek in desultory intercourse with\r\npretty women. His attitude had been one of admiring spectatorship,\r\nand he would have been almost sorry to detect in her any emotional\r\nweakness which should interfere with the fulfilment of her aims.\r\nBut now the hint of this weakness had become the most interesting\r\nthing about her. He had come on her that morning in a moment of\r\ndisarray; her face had been pale and altered, and the diminution\r\nof her beauty had lent her a poignant charm. THAT IS HOW SHE LOOKS\r\nWHEN SHE IS ALONE! had been his first thought; and the second was\r\nto note in her the change which his coming produced. It was the\r\ndanger-point of their intercourse that he could not doubt the\r\nspontaneity of her liking. From whatever angle he viewed their\r\ndawning intimacy, he could not see it as part of her scheme of\r\nlife; and to be the unforeseen element in a career so accurately\r\nplanned was stimulating even to a man who had renounced sentimental\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdid it make you want to see more? Are you going\r\nto become one of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had drawn out his cigarettes as he spoke, and she reached her\r\nhand toward the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do give me one\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t smoked for days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy such unnatural abstinence? Everybody smokes at Bellomont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94but it is not considered becoming in a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER;\r\nand at the present moment I am a JEUNE FILLE A MARIER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, then I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we can\xe2\x80\x99t let you into the republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Is it a celibate order?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least, though I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say there are not many\r\nmarried people in it. But you will marry some one very rich, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s as hard for rich people to get into as the kingdom of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s unjust, I think, because, as I understand it, one of the\r\nconditions of citizenship is not to think too much about money, and\r\nthe only way not to think about money is to have a great deal of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might as well say that the only way not to think about air is\r\nto have enough to breathe. That is true enough in a sense; but your\r\nlungs are thinking about the air, if you are not. And so it is with\r\nyour rich people\xe2\x80\x94they may not be thinking of money, but they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nbreathing it all the while; take them into another element and see\r\nhow they squirm and gasp!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily sat gazing absently through the blue rings of her\r\ncigarette-smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said at length, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you spend a good deal\r\nof your time in the element you disapprove of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden received this thrust without discomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I have\r\ntried to remain amphibious: it\xe2\x80\x99s all right as long as one\xe2\x80\x99s lungs\r\ncan work in another air. The real alchemy consists in being able\r\nto turn gold back again into something else; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the secret\r\nthat most of your friends have lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily mused. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nthe people who find fault with society are too apt to regard it as\r\nan end and not a means, just as the people who despise money speak\r\nas if its only use were to be kept in bags and gloated over? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit fairer to look at them both as opportunities, which may be used\r\neither stupidly or intelligently, according to the capacity of the\r\nuser?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is certainly the sane view; but the queer thing about society\r\nis that the people who regard it as an end are those who are in it,\r\nand not the critics on the fence. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the other way with most\r\nshows\xe2\x80\x94the audience may be under the illusion, but the actors know\r\nthat real life is on the other side of the footlights. The people\r\nwho take society as an escape from work are putting it to its\r\nproper use; but when it becomes the thing worked for it distorts\r\nall the relations of life.\xe2\x80\x9d Selden raised himself on his elbow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t underrate the decorative side\r\nof life. It seems to me the sense of splendour has justified itself\r\nby what it has produced. The worst of it is that so much human\r\nnature is used up in the process. If we\xe2\x80\x99re all the raw stuff of the\r\ncosmic effects, one would rather be the fire that tempers a sword\r\nthan the fish that dyes a purple cloak. And a society like ours\r\nwastes such good material in producing its little patch of purple!\r\nLook at a boy like Ned Silverton\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s really too good to be used to\r\nrefurbish anybody\xe2\x80\x99s social shabbiness. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lad just setting\r\nout to discover the universe: isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a pity he should end by\r\nfinding it in Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNed is a dear boy, and I hope he will keep his illusions long\r\nenough to write some nice poetry about them; but do you think it is\r\nonly in society that he is likely to lose them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden answered her with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do we call all our generous\r\nideas illusions, and the mean ones truths? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a sufficient\r\ncondemnation of society to find one\xe2\x80\x99s self accepting such\r\nphraseology? I very nearly acquired the jargon at Silverton\xe2\x80\x99s age,\r\nand I know how names can alter the colour of beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had never heard him speak with such energy of affirmation. His\r\nhabitual touch was that of the eclectic, who lightly turns over\r\nand compares; and she was moved by this sudden glimpse into the\r\nlaboratory where his faiths were formed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are as bad as the other sectarians,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\ndo you call your republic a republic? It is a closed corporation,\r\nand you create arbitrary objections in order to keep people out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not MY republic; if it were, I should have a COUP D\xe2\x80\x99ETAT and\r\nseat you on the throne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereas, in reality, you think I can never even get my foot across\r\nthe threshold? Oh, I understand what you mean. You despise my\r\nambitions\xe2\x80\x94you think them unworthy of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden smiled, but not ironically. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a tribute? I\r\nthink them quite worthy of most of the people who live by them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had turned to gaze on him gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that,\r\nif I had the opportunities of these people, I might make a better\r\nuse of them? Money stands for all kinds of things\xe2\x80\x94its purchasing\r\nquality isn\xe2\x80\x99t limited to diamonds and motor-cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least: you might expiate your enjoyment of them by\r\nfounding a hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you think they are what I should really enjoy, you must\r\nthink my ambitions are good enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden met this appeal with a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear Miss Bart, I am\r\nnot divine Providence, to guarantee your enjoying the things you\r\nare trying to get!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the best you can say for me is, that after struggling to get\r\nthem I probably shan\xe2\x80\x99t like them?\xe2\x80\x9d She drew a deep breath. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\nmiserable future you foresee for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94have you never foreseen it for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d The slow colour\r\nrose to her cheek, not a blush of excitement but drawn from the\r\ndeep wells of feeling; it was as if the effort of her spirit had\r\nproduced it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOften and often,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it looks so much darker when you\r\nshow it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no answer to this exclamation, and for a while they sat\r\nsilent, while something throbbed between them in the wide quiet of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she turned on him with a kind of vehemence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do\r\nyou do this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you make the things I have\r\nchosen seem hateful to me, if you have nothing to give me instead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words roused Selden from the musing fit into which he had\r\nfallen. He himself did not know why he had led their talk along\r\nsuch lines; it was the last use he would have imagined himself\r\nmaking of an afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s solitude with Miss Bart. But it was one\r\nof those moments when neither seemed to speak deliberately, when\r\nan indwelling voice in each called to the other across unsounded\r\ndepths of feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have nothing to give you instead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting up and\r\nturning so that he faced her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had, it should be yours, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe received this abrupt declaration in a way even stranger than\r\nthe manner of its making: she dropped her face on her hands and he\r\nsaw that for a moment she wept.\r\n\r\nIt was for a moment only, however; for when he leaned nearer and\r\ndrew down her hands with a gesture less passionate than grave, she\r\nturned on him a face softened but not disfigured by emotion, and he\r\nsaid to himself, somewhat cruelly, that even her weeping was an art.\r\n\r\nThe reflection steadied his voice as he asked, between pity and\r\nirony: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it natural that I should try to belittle all the\r\nthings I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer face brightened at this, but she drew her hand away, not with\r\na gesture of coquetry, but as though renouncing something to which\r\nshe had no claim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you belittle ME, don\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned gently, \xe2\x80\x9cin being so\r\nsure they are the only things I care for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden felt an inner start; but it was only the last quiver of his\r\negoism. Almost at once he answered quite simply: \xe2\x80\x9cBut you do care\r\nfor them, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? And no wishing of mine can alter that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had so completely ceased to consider how far this might carry\r\nhim, that he had a distinct sense of disappointment when she turned\r\non him a face sparkling with derision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cfor all your fine phrases you\xe2\x80\x99re really as great\r\na coward as I am, for you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have made one of them if you\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so sure of my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shock of this retort had the effect of crystallizing Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwavering intentions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of your answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I do you\r\nthe justice to believe that you are not either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was her turn to look at him with surprise; and after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\xe2\x80\x94but perhaps I should if\r\nyou did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I told you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re so sure of me that you can amuse\r\nyourself with experiments.\xe2\x80\x9d She drew back the hand he had regained,\r\nand sat looking down on him sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not making experiments,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cOr if I am, it is\r\nnot on you but on myself. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what effect they are going\r\nto have on me\xe2\x80\x94but if marrying you is one of them, I will take the\r\nrisk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a great risk, certainly\xe2\x80\x94I have\r\nnever concealed from you how great.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you who are the coward!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe had risen, and he stood facing her with his eyes on hers. The\r\nsoft isolation of the falling day enveloped them: they seemed\r\nlifted into a finer air. All the exquisite influences of the\r\nhour trembled in their veins, and drew them to each other as the\r\nloosened leaves were drawn to the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s you who are the coward,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, catching her hands in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nShe leaned on him for a moment, as if with a drop of tired wings:\r\nhe felt as though her heart were beating rather with the stress\r\nof a long flight than the thrill of new distances. Then, drawing\r\nback with a little smile of warning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI shall look hideous in dowdy\r\nclothes; but I can trim my own hats,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared.\r\n\r\nThey stood silent for a while after this, smiling at each other\r\nlike adventurous children who have climbed to a forbidden height\r\nfrom which they discover a new world. The actual world at their\r\nfeet was veiling itself in dimness, and across the valley a clear\r\nmoon rose in the denser blue.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard a remote sound, like the hum of a giant insect,\r\nand following the high-road, which wound whiter through the\r\nsurrounding twilight, a black object rushed across their vision.\r\n\r\nLily started from her attitude of absorption; her smile faded and\r\nshe began to move toward the lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea it was so late! We shall not be back till after\r\ndark,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost impatiently.\r\n\r\nSelden was looking at her with surprise: it took him a moment to\r\nregain his usual view of her; then he said, with an uncontrollable\r\nnote of dryness: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not one of our party; the motor was\r\ngoing the other way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and he saw her redden through the\r\ntwilight. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I told them I was not well\xe2\x80\x94that I should not go out.\r\nLet us go down!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\nSelden continued to look at her; then he drew his cigarette-case\r\nfrom his pocket and slowly lit a cigarette. It seemed to him\r\nnecessary, at that moment, to proclaim, by some habitual gesture\r\nof this sort, his recovered hold on the actual: he had an almost\r\npuerile wish to let his companion see that, their flight over, he\r\nhad landed on his feet.\r\n\r\nShe waited while the spark flickered under his curved palm; then he\r\nheld out the cigarettes to her.\r\n\r\nShe took one with an unsteady hand, and putting it to her lips,\r\nleaned forward to draw her light from his. In the indistinctness\r\nthe little red gleam lit up the lower part of her face, and he saw\r\nher mouth tremble into a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you serious?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with an odd thrill of gaiety\r\nwhich she might have caught up, in haste, from a heap of stock\r\ninflections, without having time to select the just note. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice was under better control. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I\r\ntook no risks in being so.\xe2\x80\x9d And as she continued to stand before\r\nhim, a little pale under the retort, he added quickly: \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n\r\nIt spoke much for the depth of Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s friendship that her\r\nvoice, in admonishing Miss Bart, took the same note of personal\r\ndespair as if she had been lamenting the collapse of a house-party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say is, Lily, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t make you out!\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned\r\nback, sighing, in the morning abandon of lace and muslin, turning\r\nan indifferent shoulder to the heaped-up importunities of her desk,\r\nwhile she considered, with the eye of a physician who has given up\r\nthe case, the erect exterior of the patient confronting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me you were going in for him seriously\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure you made that plain enough from the beginning! Why else did\r\nyou ask me to let you off bridge, and to keep away Carry and Kate\r\nCorby? I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you did it because he amused you; we could\r\nnone of us imagine your putting up with him for a moment unless\r\nyou meant to marry him. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everybody played fair! They\r\nall wanted to help it along. Even Bertha kept her hands off\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\nsay that\xe2\x80\x94till Lawrence came down and you dragged him away from\r\nher. After that she had a right to retaliate\xe2\x80\x94why on earth did you\r\ninterfere with her? You\xe2\x80\x99ve known Lawrence Selden for years\xe2\x80\x94why did\r\nyou behave as if you had just discovered him? If you had a grudge\r\nagainst Bertha it was a stupid time to show it\xe2\x80\x94you could have paid\r\nher back just as well after you were married! I told you Bertha\r\nwas dangerous. She was in an odious mood when she came here, but\r\nLawrence\xe2\x80\x99s turning up put her in a good humour, and if you\xe2\x80\x99d only\r\nlet her think he came for HER it would have never occurred to her\r\nto play you this trick. Oh, Lily, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never do anything if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not serious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart accepted this exhortation in a spirit of the purest\r\nimpartiality. Why should she have been angry? It was the voice\r\nof her own conscience which spoke to her through Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreproachful accents. But even to her own conscience she must trump\r\nup a semblance of defence. \xe2\x80\x9cI only took a day off\xe2\x80\x94I thought he\r\nmeant to stay on all this week, and I knew Mr. Selden was leaving\r\nthis morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor brushed aside the plea with a gesture which laid bare\r\nits weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did mean to stay\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the worst of it. It shows that he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrun away from you; that Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s done her work and poisoned him\r\nthoroughly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily gave a slight laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if he\xe2\x80\x99s running I\xe2\x80\x99ll overtake him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer friend threw out an arresting hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you do, Lily, do\r\nnothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart received the warning with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean,\r\nliterally, to take the next train. There are ways\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But she did\r\nnot go on to specify them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor sharply corrected the tense. \xe2\x80\x9cThere WERE ways\xe2\x80\x94plenty\r\nof them! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you needed to have them pointed out.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive yourself\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly frightened. He has run\r\nstraight home to his mother, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll protect him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to the death,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily agreed, dimpling at the vision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you can LAUGH\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d her friend rebuked her; and she dropped back\r\nto a soberer perception of things with the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it\r\nBertha really told him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me\xe2\x80\x94horrors! She seemed to have raked up everything. Oh,\r\nyou know what I mean\xe2\x80\x94of course there isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything, REALLY; but\r\nI suppose she brought in Prince Varigliano\xe2\x80\x94and Lord Hubert\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere was some story of your having borrowed money of old Ned Van\r\nAlstyne: did you ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my father\xe2\x80\x99s cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course she left THAT out. It seems Ned told Carry Fisher;\r\nand she told Bertha, naturally. They\xe2\x80\x99re all alike, you know: they\r\nhold their tongues for years, and you think you\xe2\x80\x99re safe, but when\r\ntheir opportunity comes they remember everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily had grown pale: her voice had a harsh note in it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nsome money I lost at bridge at the Van Osburghs\xe2\x80\x99. I repaid it, of\r\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember that; besides, it was the idea\r\nof the gambling debt that frightened Percy. Oh, Bertha knew her\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94she knew just what to tell him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this strain Mrs. Trenor continued for nearly an hour to admonish\r\nher friend. Miss Bart listened with admirable equanimity. Her\r\nnaturally good temper had been disciplined by years of enforced\r\ncompliance, since she had almost always had to attain her ends\r\nby the circuitous path of other people\xe2\x80\x99s; and, being naturally\r\ninclined to face unpleasant facts as soon as they presented\r\nthemselves, she was not sorry to hear an impartial statement of\r\nwhat her folly was likely to cost, the more so as her own thoughts\r\nwere still insisting on the other side of the case. Presented\r\nin the light of Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous comments, the reckoning\r\nwas certainly a formidable one, and Lily, as she listened, found\r\nherself gradually reverting to her friend\xe2\x80\x99s view of the situation.\r\nMrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s words were moreover emphasized for her hearer by\r\nanxieties which she herself could scarcely guess. Affluence, unless\r\nstimulated by a keen imagination, forms but the vaguest notion of\r\nthe practical strain of poverty. Judy knew it must be \xe2\x80\x9chorrid\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\npoor Lily to have to stop to consider whether she could afford\r\nreal lace on her petticoats, and not to have a motor-car and a\r\nsteam-yacht at her orders; but the daily friction of unpaid bills,\r\nthe daily nibble of small temptations to expenditure, were trials\r\nas far out of her experience as the domestic problems of the\r\nchar-woman. Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s unconsciousness of the real stress of the\r\nsituation had the effect of making it more galling to Lily. While\r\nher friend reproached her for missing the opportunity to eclipse\r\nher rivals, she was once more battling in imagination with the\r\nmounting tide of indebtedness from which she had so nearly escaped.\r\nWhat wind of folly had driven her out again on those dark seas?\r\n\r\nIf anything was needed to put the last touch to her self-abasement\r\nit was the sense of the way her old life was opening its ruts again\r\nto receive her. Yesterday her fancy had fluttered free pinions\r\nabove a choice of occupations; now she had to drop to the level of\r\nthe familiar routine, in which moments of seeming brilliancy and\r\nfreedom alternated with long hours of subjection.\r\n\r\nShe laid a deprecating hand on her friend\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Judy! I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\r\nto have been such a bore, and you are very good to me. But you must\r\nhave some letters for me to answer\xe2\x80\x94let me at least be useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe settled herself at the desk, and Mrs. Trenor accepted her\r\nresumption of the morning\xe2\x80\x99s task with a sigh which implied that,\r\nafter all, she had proved herself unfit for higher uses.\r\n\r\nThe luncheon-table showed a depleted circle. All the men but Jack\r\nStepney and Dorset had returned to town (it seemed to Lily a last\r\ntouch of irony that Selden and Percy Gryce should have gone in the\r\nsame train), and Lady Cressida and the attendant Wetheralls had\r\nbeen despatched by motor to lunch at a distant country-house. At\r\nsuch moments of diminished interest it was usual for Mrs. Dorset to\r\nkeep her room till the afternoon; but on this occasion she drifted\r\nin when luncheon was half over, hollowed-eyed and drooping, but\r\nwith an edge of malice under her indifference.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows as she looked about the table. \xe2\x80\x9cHow few of\r\nus are left! I do so enjoy the quiet\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you, Lily? I wish the\r\nmen would always stop away\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s really much nicer without them.\r\nOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t count, George: one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband. But I thought Mr. Gryce was to stay for the rest of the\r\nweek?\xe2\x80\x9d she added enquiringly. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he intend to, Judy? He\xe2\x80\x99s such\r\na nice boy\xe2\x80\x94I wonder what drove him away? He is rather shy, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid we may have shocked him: he has been brought up in such an\r\nold-fashioned way. Do you know, Lily, he told me he had never seen\r\na girl play cards for money till he saw you doing it the other\r\nnight? And he lives on the interest of his income, and always has a\r\nlot left over to invest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher leaned forward eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe it is some one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nduty to educate that young man. It is shocking that he has never\r\nbeen made to realize his duties as a citizen. Every wealthy man\r\nshould be compelled to study the laws of his country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorset glanced at her quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he HAS studied the\r\ndivorce laws. He told me he had promised the Bishop to sign some\r\nkind of a petition against divorce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher reddened under her powder, and Stepney said with\r\na laughing glance at Miss Bart: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he is thinking of\r\nmarriage, and wants to tinker up the old ship before he goes\r\naboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis betrothed looked shocked at the metaphor, and George Dorset\r\nexclaimed with a sardonic growl: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor devil! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the ship\r\nthat will do for him, it\xe2\x80\x99s the crew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr the stowaways,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Corby brightly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I contemplated a\r\nvoyage with him I should try to start with a friend in the hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s vague feeling of pique was struggling for\r\nappropriate expression. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you laugh at him;\r\nI think he\xe2\x80\x99s very nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cand, at any rate, a girl\r\nwho married him would always have enough to be comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked puzzled at the redoubled laughter which hailed her\r\nwords, but it might have consoled her to know how deeply they had\r\nsunk into the breast of one of her hearers.\r\n\r\nComfortable! At that moment the word was more eloquent to Lily\r\nBart than any other in the language. She could not even pause to\r\nsmile over the heiress\xe2\x80\x99s view of a colossal fortune as a mere\r\nshelter against want: her mind was filled with the vision of what\r\nthat shelter might have been to her. Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s pin-pricks did\r\nnot smart, for her own irony cut deeper: no one could hurt her as\r\nmuch as she was hurting herself, for no one else\xe2\x80\x94not even Judy\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x94knew the full magnitude of her folly.\r\n\r\nShe was roused from these unprofitable considerations by a\r\nwhispered request from her hostess, who drew her apart as they left\r\nthe luncheon-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily, dear, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing special to do, may I tell Carry\r\nFisher that you intend to drive to the station and fetch Gus? He\r\nwill be back at four, and I know she has it in her mind to meet\r\nhim. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to have him amused, but I happen to\r\nknow that she has bled him rather severely since she\xe2\x80\x99s been here,\r\nand she is so keen about going to fetch him that I fancy she must\r\nhave got a lot more bills this morning. It seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nTrenor feelingly concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat most of her alimony is paid by\r\nother women\xe2\x80\x99s husbands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart, on her way to the station, had leisure to muse over\r\nher friend\xe2\x80\x99s words, and their peculiar application to herself.\r\nWhy should she have to suffer for having once, for a few hours,\r\nborrowed money of an elderly cousin, when a woman like Carry\r\nFisher could make a living unrebuked from the good-nature of her\r\nmen friends and the tolerance of their wives? It all turned on the\r\ntiresome distinction between what a married woman might, and a\r\ngirl might not, do. Of course it was shocking for a married woman\r\nto borrow money\xe2\x80\x94and Lily was expertly aware of the implication\r\ninvolved\xe2\x80\x94but still, it was the mere MALUM PROHIBITUM which the\r\nworld decries but condones, and which, though it may be punished by\r\nprivate vengeance, does not provoke the collective disapprobation\r\nof society. To Miss Bart, in short, no such opportunities were\r\npossible. She could of course borrow from her women friends\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhundred here or there, at the utmost\xe2\x80\x94but they were more ready to\r\ngive a gown or a trinket, and looked a little askance when she\r\nhinted her preference for a cheque. Women are not generous lenders,\r\nand those among whom her lot was cast were either in the same\r\ncase as herself, or else too far removed from it to understand\r\nits necessities. The result of her meditations was the decision\r\nto join her aunt at Richfield. She could not remain at Bellomont\r\nwithout playing bridge, and being involved in other expenses;\r\nand to continue her usual series of autumn visits would merely\r\nprolong the same difficulties. She had reached a point where abrupt\r\nretrenchment was necessary, and the only cheap life was a dull\r\nlife. She would start the next morning for Richfield.\r\n\r\nAt the station she thought Gus Trenor seemed surprised, and not\r\nwholly unrelieved, to see her. She yielded up the reins of the\r\nlight runabout in which she had driven over, and as he climbed\r\nheavily to her side, crushing her into a scant third of the seat,\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x9cHalloo! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t often you honour me. You must have been\r\nuncommonly hard up for something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was warm, and propinquity made her more than usually\r\nconscious that he was red and massive, and that beads of moisture\r\nhad caused the dust of the train to adhere unpleasantly to the\r\nbroad expanse of cheek and neck which he turned to her; but she was\r\naware also, from the look in his small dull eyes, that the contact\r\nwith her freshness and slenderness was as agreeable to him as the\r\nsight of a cooling beverage.\r\n\r\nThe perception of this fact helped her to answer gaily: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\noften I have the chance. There are too many ladies to dispute the\r\nprivilege with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe privilege of driving me home? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you won the race,\r\nanyhow. But I know what really happened\xe2\x80\x94my wife sent you. Now\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had the dull man\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected flashes of astuteness, and Lily\r\ncould not help joining in the laugh with which he had pounced on\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Judy thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m the safest person for you to be with; and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is she, though? If she is, it\xe2\x80\x99s because you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t waste\r\nyour time on an old hulk like me. We married men have to put up\r\nwith what we can get: all the prizes are for the clever chaps\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ve kept a free foot. Let me light a cigar, will you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a\r\nbeastly day of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew up in the shade of the village street, and passed the\r\nreins to her while he held a match to his cigar. The little flame\r\nunder his hand cast a deeper crimson on his puffing face, and Lily\r\naverted her eyes with a momentary feeling of repugnance. And yet\r\nsome women thought him handsome!\r\n\r\nAs she handed back the reins, she said sympathetically: \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\r\nhave such a lot of tiresome things to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say so\xe2\x80\x94rather!\xe2\x80\x9d Trenor, who was seldom listened to,\r\neither by his wife or her friends, settled down into the rare\r\nenjoyment of a confidential talk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know how a fellow\r\nhas to hustle to keep this kind of thing going.\xe2\x80\x9d He waved his\r\nwhip in the direction of the Bellomont acres, which lay outspread\r\nbefore them in opulent undulations. \xe2\x80\x9cJudy has no idea of what she\r\nspends\xe2\x80\x94not that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t plenty to keep the thing going,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninterrupted himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a man has got to keep his eyes open and\r\npick up all the tips he can. My father and mother used to live\r\nlike fighting-cocks on their income, and put by a good bit of it\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94luckily for me\xe2\x80\x94but at the pace we go now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where I\r\nshould be if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for taking a flyer now and then. The women\r\nall think\xe2\x80\x94I mean Judy thinks\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to do but to go downtown\r\nonce a month and cut off coupons, but the truth is it takes a\r\ndevilish lot of hard work to keep the machinery running. Not that I\r\nought to complain today, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nI did a very neat stroke of business, thanks to Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nRosedale: by the way, Miss Lily, I wish you\xe2\x80\x99d try to persuade Judy\r\nto be decently civil to that chap. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be rich enough to\r\nbuy us all out one of these days, and if she\xe2\x80\x99d only ask him to dine\r\nnow and then I could get almost anything out of him. The man is mad\r\nto know the people who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know him, and when a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin that state there is nothing he won\xe2\x80\x99t do for the first woman who\r\ntakes him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily hesitated a moment. The first part of her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscourse had started an interesting train of thought, which was\r\nrudely interrupted by the mention of Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s name. She\r\nuttered a faint protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know Jack did try to take him about, and he was\r\nimpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang it\xe2\x80\x94because he\xe2\x80\x99s fat and shiny, and has a sloppy manner!\r\nWell, all I can say is that the people who are clever enough to be\r\ncivil to him now will make a mighty good thing of it. A few years\r\nfrom now he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in it whether we want him or not, and then he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be giving away a half-a-million tip for a dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s mind had reverted from the intrusive personality of Mr.\r\nRosedale to the train of thought set in motion by Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nwords. This vast mysterious Wall Street world of \xe2\x80\x9ctips\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdeals\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94might she not find in it the means of escape from her\r\ndreary predicament? She had often heard of women making money in\r\nthis way through their friends: she had no more notion than most of\r\nher sex of the exact nature of the transaction, and its vagueness\r\nseemed to diminish its indelicacy. She could not, indeed, imagine\r\nherself, in any extremity, stooping to extract a \xe2\x80\x9ctip\xe2\x80\x9d from Mr.\r\nRosedale; but at her side was a man in possession of that precious\r\ncommodity, and who, as the husband of her dearest friend, stood to\r\nher in a relation of almost fraternal intimacy.\r\n\r\nIn her inmost heart Lily knew it was not by appealing to the\r\nfraternal instinct that she was likely to move Gus Trenor; but this\r\nway of explaining the situation helped to drape its crudity, and\r\nshe was always scrupulous about keeping up appearances to herself.\r\nHer personal fastidiousness had a moral equivalent, and when she\r\nmade a tour of inspection in her own mind there were certain closed\r\ndoors she did not open.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the gates of Bellomont she turned to Trenor with a\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cThe afternoon is so perfect\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to drive me a\r\nlittle farther? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been rather out of spirits all day, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso restful to be away from people, with some one who won\xe2\x80\x99t mind if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a little dull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked so plaintively lovely as she proffered the request, so\r\ntrustfully sure of his sympathy and understanding, that Trenor felt\r\nhimself wishing that his wife could see how other women treated\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94not battered wire-pullers like Mrs. Fisher, but a girl that\r\nmost men would have given their boots to get such a look from.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of spirits? Why on earth should you ever be out of spirits? Is\r\nyour last box of Doucet dresses a failure, or did Judy rook you out\r\nof everything at bridge last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily shook her head with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had to give up Doucet;\r\nand bridge too\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it. In fact I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford any of\r\nthe things my friends do, and I am afraid Judy often thinks me a\r\nbore because I don\xe2\x80\x99t play cards any longer, and because I am not as\r\nsmartly dressed as the other women. But you will think me a bore\r\ntoo if I talk to you about my worries, and I only mention them\r\nbecause I want you to do me a favour\xe2\x80\x94the very greatest of favours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes sought his once more, and she smiled inwardly at the tinge\r\nof apprehension that she read in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can manage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off, and\r\nshe guessed that his enjoyment was disturbed by the remembrance of\r\nMrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s methods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest of favours,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined gently. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, Judy\r\nis angry with me, and I want you to make my peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry with you? Oh, come, nonsense\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d his relief broke through in\r\na laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know she\xe2\x80\x99s devoted to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is the best friend I have, and that is why I mind having to\r\nvex her. But I daresay you know what she has wanted me to do. She\r\nhas set her heart\xe2\x80\x94poor dear\xe2\x80\x94on my marrying\xe2\x80\x94marrying a great deal of\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused with a slight falter of embarrassment, and Trenor,\r\nturning abruptly, fixed on her a look of growing intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal of money? Oh, by Jove\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean Gryce? What\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ndo? Oh, no, of course I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it\xe2\x80\x94you can trust me to keep\r\nmy mouth shut\xe2\x80\x94but Gryce\xe2\x80\x94good Lord, GRYCE! Did Judy really think you\r\ncould bring yourself to marry that portentous little ass? But you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, eh? And so you gave him the sack, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason\r\nwhy he lit out by the first train this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned back,\r\nspreading himself farther across the seat, as if dilated by the\r\njoyful sense of his own discernment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth could Judy think\r\nyou would do such a thing? I could have told her you\xe2\x80\x99d never put up\r\nwith such a little milksop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily sighed more deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nmen understand a woman\xe2\x80\x99s motives better than other women do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome men\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m certain of it! I could have TOLD Judy,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated,\r\nexulting in the implied superiority over his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would understand; that\xe2\x80\x99s why I wanted to speak to\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make that kind of marriage; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible. But neither can I go on living as all the women in my\r\nset do. I am almost entirely dependent on my aunt, and though she\r\nis very kind to me she makes me no regular allowance, and lately\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost money at cards, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t dare tell her about it. I\r\nhave paid my card debts, of course, but there is hardly anything\r\nleft for my other expenses, and if I go on with my present life I\r\nshall be in horrible difficulties. I have a tiny income of my own,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s badly invested, for it seems to bring in less\r\nevery year, and I am so ignorant of money matters that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow if my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s agent, who looks after it, is a good adviser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe paused a moment, and added in a lighter tone: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto bore you with all this, but I want your help in making Judy\r\nunderstand that I can\xe2\x80\x99t, at present, go on living as one must\r\nlive among you all. I am going away tomorrow to join my aunt at\r\nRichfield, and I shall stay there for the rest of the autumn, and\r\ndismiss my maid and learn how to mend my own clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this picture of loveliness in distress, the pathos of which\r\nwas heightened by the light touch with which it was drawn, a\r\nmurmur of indignant sympathy broke from Trenor. Twenty-four hours\r\nearlier, if his wife had consulted him on the subject of Miss\r\nBart\xe2\x80\x99s future, he would have said that a girl with extravagant\r\ntastes and no money had better marry the first rich man she could\r\nget; but with the subject of discussion at his side, turning to\r\nhim for sympathy, making him feel that he understood her better\r\nthan her dearest friends, and confirming the assurance by the\r\nappeal of her exquisite nearness, he was ready to swear that such\r\na marriage was a desecration, and that, as a man of honour, he was\r\nbound to do all he could to protect her from the results of her\r\ndisinterestedness. This impulse was reinforced by the reflection\r\nthat if she had married Gryce she would have been surrounded\r\nby flattery and approval, whereas, having refused to sacrifice\r\nherself to expediency, she was left to bear the whole cost of\r\nher resistance. Hang it, if he could find a way out of such\r\ndifficulties for a professional sponge like Carry Fisher, who was\r\nsimply a mental habit corresponding to the physical titillations\r\nof the cigarette or the cock-tail, he could surely do as much for\r\na girl who appealed to his highest sympathies, and who brought her\r\ntroubles to him with the trustfulness of a child.\r\n\r\nTrenor and Miss Bart prolonged their drive till long after sunset;\r\nand before it was over he had tried, with some show of success, to\r\nprove to her that, if she would only trust him, he could make a\r\nhandsome sum of money for her without endangering the small amount\r\nshe possessed. She was too genuinely ignorant of the manipulations\r\nof the stock-market to understand his technical explanations, or\r\neven perhaps to perceive that certain points in them were slurred;\r\nthe haziness enveloping the transaction served as a veil for her\r\nembarrassment, and through the general blur her hopes dilated like\r\nlamps in a fog. She understood only that her modest investments\r\nwere to be mysteriously multiplied without risk to herself; and the\r\nassurance that this miracle would take place within a short time,\r\nthat there would be no tedious interval for suspense and reaction,\r\nrelieved her of her lingering scruples.\r\n\r\nAgain she felt the lightening of her load, and with it the release\r\nof repressed activities. Her immediate worries conjured, it was\r\neasy to resolve that she would never again find herself in such\r\nstraits, and as the need of economy and self-denial receded\r\nfrom her foreground she felt herself ready to meet any other\r\ndemand which life might make. Even the immediate one of letting\r\nTrenor, as they drove homeward, lean a little nearer and rest\r\nhis hand reassuringly on hers, cost her only a momentary shiver\r\nof reluctance. It was part of the game to make him feel that her\r\nappeal had been an uncalculated impulse, provoked by the liking he\r\ninspired; and the renewed sense of power in handling men, while it\r\nconsoled her wounded vanity, helped also to obscure the thought of\r\nthe claim at which his manner hinted. He was a coarse dull man who,\r\nunder all his show of authority, was a mere supernumerary in the\r\ncostly show for which his money paid: surely, to a clever girl, it\r\nwould be easy to hold him by his vanity, and so keep the obligation\r\non his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thousand dollar cheque which Lily received with a blotted\r\nscrawl from Gus Trenor strengthened her self-confidence in the\r\nexact degree to which it effaced her debts.\r\n\r\nThe transaction had justified itself by its results: she saw now\r\nhow absurd it would have been to let any primitive scruple deprive\r\nher of this easy means of appeasing her creditors. Lily felt really\r\nvirtuous as she dispensed the sum in sops to her tradesmen, and the\r\nfact that a fresh order accompanied each payment did not lessen her\r\nsense of disinterestedness. How many women, in her place, would\r\nhave given the orders without making the payment!\r\n\r\nShe had found it reassuringly easy to keep Trenor in a good humour.\r\nTo listen to his stories, to receive his confidences and laugh at\r\nhis jokes, seemed for the moment all that was required of her, and\r\nthe complacency with which her hostess regarded these attentions\r\nfreed them of the least hint of ambiguity. Mrs. Trenor evidently\r\nassumed that Lily\xe2\x80\x99s growing intimacy with her husband was simply an\r\nindirect way of returning her own kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you and Gus have become such good friends,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\napprovingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too delightful of you to be so nice to him, and\r\nput up with all his tiresome stories. I know what they are, because\r\nI had to listen to them when we were engaged\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he is telling\r\nthe same ones still. And now I shan\xe2\x80\x99t always have to be asking\r\nCarry Fisher here to keep him in a good humour. She\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect\r\nvulture, you know; and she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the least moral sense. She is\r\nalways getting Gus to speculate for her, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she never\r\npays when she loses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart could shudder at this state of things without the\r\nembarrassment of a personal application. Her own position was\r\nsurely quite different. There could be no question of her not\r\npaying when she lost, since Trenor had assured her that she was\r\ncertain not to lose. In sending her the cheque he had explained\r\nthat he had made five thousand for her out of Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctip,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhad put four thousand back in the same venture, as there was the\r\npromise of another \xe2\x80\x9cbig rise\xe2\x80\x9d; she understood therefore that he\r\nwas now speculating with her own money, and that she consequently\r\nowed him no more than the gratitude which such a trifling service\r\ndemanded. She vaguely supposed that, to raise the first sum, he had\r\nborrowed on her securities; but this was a point over which her\r\ncuriosity did not linger. It was concentrated, for the moment, on\r\nthe probable date of the next \xe2\x80\x9cbig rise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe news of this event was received by her some weeks later, on\r\nthe occasion of Jack Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Miss Van Osburgh. As\r\na cousin of the bridegroom, Miss Bart had been asked to act as\r\nbridesmaid; but she had declined on the plea that, since she was\r\nmuch taller than the other attendant virgins, her presence might\r\nmar the symmetry of the group. The truth was, she had attended too\r\nmany brides to the altar: when next seen there she meant to be the\r\nchief figure in the ceremony. She knew the pleasantries made at the\r\nexpense of young girls who have been too long before the public,\r\nand she was resolved to avoid such assumptions of youthfulness as\r\nmight lead people to think her older than she really was.\r\n\r\nThe Van Osburgh marriage was celebrated in the village church near\r\nthe paternal estate on the Hudson. It was the \xe2\x80\x9csimple country\r\nwedding\xe2\x80\x9d to which guests are convoyed in special trains, and\r\nfrom which the hordes of the uninvited have to be fended off by\r\nthe intervention of the police. While these sylvan rites were\r\ntaking place, in a church packed with fashion and festooned with\r\norchids, the representatives of the press were threading their\r\nway, note-book in hand, through the labyrinth of wedding presents,\r\nand the agent of a cinematograph syndicate was setting up his\r\napparatus at the church door. It was the kind of scene in which\r\nLily had often pictured herself as taking the principal part, and\r\non this occasion the fact that she was once more merely a casual\r\nspectator, instead of the mystically veiled figure occupying\r\nthe centre of attention, strengthened her resolve to assume the\r\nlatter part before the year was over. The fact that her immediate\r\nanxieties were relieved did not blind her to a possibility of\r\ntheir recurrence; it merely gave her enough buoyancy to rise once\r\nmore above her doubts and feel a renewed faith in her beauty, her\r\npower, and her general fitness to attract a brilliant destiny.\r\nIt could not be that one conscious of such aptitudes for mastery\r\nand enjoyment was doomed to a perpetuity of failure; and her\r\nmistakes looked easily reparable in the light of her restored\r\nself-confidence.\r\n\r\nA special appositeness was given to these reflections by the\r\ndiscovery, in a neighbouring pew, of the serious profile and\r\nneatly-trimmed beard of Mr. Percy Gryce. There was something\r\nalmost bridal in his own aspect: his large white gardenia had a\r\nsymbolic air that struck Lily as a good omen. After all, seen\r\nin an assemblage of his kind he was not ridiculous-looking: a\r\nfriendly critic might have called his heaviness weighty, and he\r\nwas at his best in the attitude of vacant passivity which brings\r\nout the oddities of the restless. She fancied he was the kind\r\nof man whose sentimental associations would be stirred by the\r\nconventional imagery of a wedding, and she pictured herself, in the\r\nseclusion of the Van Osburgh conservatories, playing skillfully\r\nupon sensibilities thus prepared for her touch. In fact, when she\r\nlooked at the other women about her, and recalled the image she\r\nhad brought away from her own glass, it did not seem as though any\r\nspecial skill would be needed to repair her blunder and bring him\r\nonce more to her feet.\r\n\r\nThe sight of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s dark head, in a pew almost facing her,\r\ndisturbed for a moment the balance of her complacency. The rise of\r\nher blood as their eyes met was succeeded by a contrary motion,\r\na wave of resistance and withdrawal. She did not wish to see him\r\nagain, not because she feared his influence, but because his\r\npresence always had the effect of cheapening her aspirations, of\r\nthrowing her whole world out of focus. Besides, he was a living\r\nreminder of the worst mistake in her career, and the fact that he\r\nhad been its cause did not soften her feelings toward him. She\r\ncould still imagine an ideal state of existence in which, all else\r\nbeing superadded, intercourse with Selden might be the last touch\r\nof luxury; but in the world as it was, such a privilege was likely\r\nto cost more than it was worth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily, dear, I never saw you look so lovely! You look as if\r\nsomething delightful had just happened to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady who thus formulated her admiration of her\r\nbrilliant friend did not, in her own person, suggest such happy\r\npossibilities. Miss Gertrude Farish, in fact, typified the mediocre\r\nand the ineffectual. If there were compensating qualities in her\r\nwide frank glance and the freshness of her smile, these were\r\nqualities which only the sympathetic observer would perceive\r\nbefore noticing that her eyes were of a workaday grey and her lips\r\nwithout haunting curves. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s own view of her wavered between\r\npity for her limitations and impatience at her cheerful acceptance\r\nof them. To Miss Bart, as to her mother, acquiescence in dinginess\r\nwas evidence of stupidity; and there were moments when, in the\r\nconsciousness of her own power to look and to be so exactly what\r\nthe occasion required, she almost felt that other girls were plain\r\nand inferior from choice. Certainly no one need have confessed such\r\nacquiescence in her lot as was revealed in the \xe2\x80\x9cuseful\xe2\x80\x9d colour of\r\nGerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s gown and the subdued lines of her hat: it is almost\r\nas stupid to let your clothes betray that you know you are ugly as\r\nto have them proclaim that you think you are beautiful.\r\n\r\nOf course, being fatally poor and dingy, it was wise of Gerty to\r\nhave taken up philanthropy and symphony concerts; but there was\r\nsomething irritating in her assumption that existence yielded no\r\nhigher pleasures, and that one might get as much interest and\r\nexcitement out of life in a cramped flat as in the splendours\r\nof the Van Osburgh establishment. Today, however, her chirping\r\nenthusiasms did not irritate Lily. They seemed only to throw her\r\nown exceptionalness into becoming relief, and give a soaring\r\nvastness to her scheme of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo let us go and take a peep at the presents before everyone else\r\nleaves the dining-room!\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Miss Farish, linking her arm in\r\nher friend\xe2\x80\x99s. It was characteristic of her to take a sentimental\r\nand unenvious interest in all the details of a wedding: she was\r\nthe kind of person who always kept her handkerchief out during the\r\nservice, and departed clutching a box of wedding-cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t everything beautifully done?\xe2\x80\x9d she pursued, as they entered\r\nthe distant drawing-room assigned to the display of Miss Van\r\nOsburgh\xe2\x80\x99s bridal spoils. \xe2\x80\x9cI always say no one does things better\r\nthan cousin Grace! Did you ever taste anything more delicious than\r\nthat MOUSSE of lobster with champagne sauce? I made up my mind\r\nweeks ago that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss this wedding, and just fancy how\r\ndelightfully it all came about. When Lawrence Selden heard I was\r\ncoming, he insisted on fetching me himself and driving me to the\r\nstation, and when we go back this evening I am to dine with him at\r\nSherry\xe2\x80\x99s. I really feel as excited as if I were getting married\r\nmyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily smiled: she knew that Selden had always been kind to his dull\r\ncousin, and she had sometimes wondered why he wasted so much time\r\nin such an unremunerative manner; but now the thought gave her a\r\nvague pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see him often?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; he is very good about dropping in on Sundays. And now and\r\nthen we do a play together; but lately I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen much of him.\r\nHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look well, and he seems nervous and unsettled. The dear\r\nfellow! I do wish he would marry some nice girl. I told him so\r\ntoday, but he said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the really nice ones, and\r\nthe other kind didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for him\xe2\x80\x94but that was just his joke, of\r\ncourse. He could never marry a girl who WASN\xe2\x80\x99T nice. Oh, my dear,\r\ndid you ever see such pearls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had paused before the table on which the bride\xe2\x80\x99s jewels were\r\ndisplayed, and Lily\xe2\x80\x99s heart gave an envious throb as she caught\r\nthe refraction of light from their surfaces\xe2\x80\x94the milky gleam of\r\nperfectly matched pearls, the flash of rubies relieved against\r\ncontrasting velvet, the intense blue rays of sapphires kindled into\r\nlight by surrounding diamonds: all these precious tints enhanced\r\nand deepened by the varied art of their setting. The glow of the\r\nstones warmed Lily\xe2\x80\x99s veins like wine. More completely than any\r\nother expression of wealth they symbolized the life she longed to\r\nlead, the life of fastidious aloofness and refinement in which\r\nevery detail should have the finish of a jewel, and the whole form\r\na harmonious setting to her own jewel-like rareness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lily, do look at this diamond pendant\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s as big as\r\na dinner-plate! Who can have given it?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Farish bent\r\nshort-sightedly over the accompanying card. \xe2\x80\x9cMR. SIMON ROSEDALE.\r\nWhat, that horrid man? Oh, yes\xe2\x80\x94I remember he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of Jack\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand I suppose cousin Grace had to ask him here today; but she must\r\nrather hate having to let Gwen accept such a present from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily smiled. She doubted Mrs. Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance, but was\r\naware of Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s habit of ascribing her own delicacies of\r\nfeeling to the persons least likely to be encumbered by them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if Gwen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care to be seen wearing it she can always\r\nexchange it for something else,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here is something so much prettier,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Farish continued.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo look at this exquisite white sapphire. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the person who\r\nchose it must have taken particular pains. What is the name? Percy\r\nGryce? Ah, then I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised!\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled significantly as\r\nshe replaced the card. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that he\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly\r\ndevoted to Evie Van Osburgh? Cousin Grace is so pleased about\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a romance! He met her first at the George Dorsets\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nonly about six weeks ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just the nicest possible\r\nmarriage for dear Evie. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the money\xe2\x80\x94of course she\r\nhas plenty of her own\xe2\x80\x94but she\xe2\x80\x99s such a quiet stay-at-home kind of\r\ngirl, and it seems he has just the same tastes; so they are exactly\r\nsuited to each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily stood staring vacantly at the white sapphire on its velvet\r\nbed. Evie Van Osburgh and Percy Gryce? The names rang derisively\r\nthrough her brain. EVIE VAN OSBURGH? The youngest, dumpiest,\r\ndullest of the four dull and dumpy daughters whom Mrs. Van Osburgh,\r\nwith unsurpassed astuteness, had \xe2\x80\x9cplaced\xe2\x80\x9d one by one in enviable\r\nniches of existence! Ah, lucky girls who grow up in the shelter of\r\na mother\xe2\x80\x99s love\xe2\x80\x94a mother who knows how to contrive opportunities\r\nwithout conceding favours, how to take advantage of propinquity\r\nwithout allowing appetite to be dulled by habit! The cleverest girl\r\nmay miscalculate where her own interests are concerned, may yield\r\ntoo much at one moment and withdraw too far at the next: it takes\r\na mother\xe2\x80\x99s unerring vigilance and foresight to land her daughters\r\nsafely in the arms of wealth and suitability.\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s passing light-heartedness sank beneath a renewed sense of\r\nfailure. Life was too stupid, too blundering! Why should Percy\r\nGryce\xe2\x80\x99s millions be joined to another great fortune, why should\r\nthis clumsy girl be put in possession of powers she would never\r\nknow how to use?\r\n\r\nShe was roused from these speculations by a familiar touch on her\r\narm, and turning saw Gus Trenor beside her. She felt a thrill of\r\nvexation: what right had he to touch her? Luckily Gerty Farish had\r\nwandered off to the next table, and they were alone.\r\n\r\nTrenor, looking stouter than ever in his tight frock-coat, and\r\nunbecomingly flushed by the bridal libations, gazed at her with\r\nundisguised approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Lily, you do look a stunner!\xe2\x80\x9d He had slipped insensibly\r\ninto the use of her Christian name, and she had never found the\r\nright moment to correct him. Besides, in her set all the men and\r\nwomen called each other by their Christian names; it was only\r\non Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s lips that the familiar address had an unpleasant\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, still jovially impervious to her annoyance,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chave you made up your mind which of these little trinkets you mean\r\nto duplicate at Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow? I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a cheque for you in my\r\npocket that will go a long way in that line!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily gave him a startled look: his voice was louder than usual,\r\nand the room was beginning to fill with people. But as her glance\r\nassured her that they were still beyond ear-shot a sense of\r\npleasure replaced her apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother dividend?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, smiling and drawing near him in the\r\ndesire not to be overheard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not exactly: I sold out on the rise and I\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled off four\r\nthou\xe2\x80\x99 for you. Not so bad for a beginner, eh? I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbegin to think you\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty knowing speculator. And perhaps you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t think poor old Gus such an awful ass as some people do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you the kindest of friends; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t thank you properly\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let her eyes shine into his with a look that made up for the\r\nhand-clasp he would have claimed if they had been alone\xe2\x80\x94and how\r\nglad she was that they were not! The news filled her with the\r\nglow produced by a sudden cessation of physical pain. The world\r\nwas not so stupid and blundering after all: now and then a stroke\r\nof luck came to the unluckiest. At the thought her spirits began\r\nto rise: it was characteristic of her that one trifling piece of\r\ngood fortune should give wings to all her hopes. Instantly came\r\nthe reflection that Percy Gryce was not irretrievably lost; and\r\nshe smiled to think of the excitement of recapturing him from\r\nEvie Van Osburgh. What chance could such a simpleton have against\r\nher if she chose to exert herself? She glanced about, hoping to\r\ncatch a glimpse of Gryce; but her eyes lit instead on the glossy\r\ncountenance of Mr. Rosedale, who was slipping through the crowd\r\nwith an air half obsequious, half obtrusive, as though, the moment\r\nhis presence was recognized, it would swell to the dimensions of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to be the means of effecting this enlargement, Lily\r\nquickly transferred her glance to Trenor, to whom the expression of\r\nher gratitude seemed not to have brought the complete gratification\r\nshe had meant it to give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang thanking me\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be thanked, but I SHOULD like\r\nthe chance to say two words to you now and then,\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you were going to spend the whole autumn with us, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nhardly laid eyes on you for the last month. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you come back\r\nto Bellomont this evening? We\xe2\x80\x99re all alone, and Judy is as cross\r\nas two sticks. Do come and cheer a fellow up. If you say yes I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nrun you over in the motor, and you can telephone your maid to bring\r\nyour traps from town by the next train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily shook her head with a charming semblance of regret. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I\r\ncould\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite impossible. My aunt has come back to town, and\r\nI must be with her for the next few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a good deal less of you since we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be such\r\npals than I used to when you were Judy\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued with\r\nunconscious penetration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was Judy\xe2\x80\x99s friend? Am I not her friend still? Really, you\r\nsay the most absurd things! If I were always at Bellomont you would\r\ntire of me much sooner than Judy\xe2\x80\x94but come and see me at my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe next afternoon you are in town; then we can have a nice quiet\r\ntalk, and you can tell me how I had better invest my fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true that, during the last three or four weeks, she had\r\nabsented herself from Bellomont on the pretext of having other\r\nvisits to pay; but she now began to feel that the reckoning she had\r\nthus contrived to evade had rolled up interest in the interval.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of the nice quiet talk did not appear as all-sufficing\r\nto Trenor as she had hoped, and his brows continued to lower as he\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can promise you a fresh tip every\r\nday. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you might do for me; and that is, just\r\nto be a little civil to Rosedale. Judy has promised to ask him to\r\ndine when we get to town, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t induce her to have him at\r\nBellomont, and if you would let me bring him up now it would make\r\na lot of difference. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe two women have spoken to him\r\nthis afternoon, and I can tell you he\xe2\x80\x99s a chap it pays to be decent\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart made an impatient movement, but suppressed the words\r\nwhich seemed about to accompany it. After all, this was an\r\nunexpectedly easy way of acquitting her debt; and had she not\r\nreasons of her own for wishing to be civil to Mr. Rosedale?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bring him by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d she said smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps I can get\r\na tip out of him on my own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor paused abruptly, and his eyes fixed themselves on hers with\r\na look which made her change colour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you know\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll please remember he\xe2\x80\x99s a blooming bounder,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said; and with a slight laugh she turned toward the open window\r\nnear which they had been standing.\r\n\r\nThe throng in the room had increased, and she felt a desire for\r\nspace and fresh air. Both of these she found on the terrace, where\r\nonly a few men were lingering over cigarettes and liqueur, while\r\nscattered couples strolled across the lawn to the autumn-tinted\r\nborders of the flower-garden.\r\n\r\nAs she emerged, a man moved toward her from the knot of smokers,\r\nand she found herself face to face with Selden. The stir of the\r\npulses which his nearness always caused was increased by a slight\r\nsense of constraint. They had not met since their Sunday afternoon\r\nwalk at Bellomont, and that episode was still so vivid to her\r\nthat she could hardly believe him to be less conscious of it. But\r\nhis greeting expressed no more than the satisfaction which every\r\npretty woman expects to see reflected in masculine eyes; and the\r\ndiscovery, if distasteful to her vanity, was reassuring to her\r\nnerves. Between the relief of her escape from Trenor, and the vague\r\napprehension of her meeting with Rosedale, it was pleasant to rest\r\na moment on the sense of complete understanding which Lawrence\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s manner always conveyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is luck,\xe2\x80\x9d he said smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI was wondering if I should be\r\nable to have a word with you before the special snatches us away. I\r\ncame with Gerty Farish, and promised not to let her miss the train,\r\nbut I am sure she is still extracting sentimental solace from the\r\nwedding presents. She appears to regard their number and value as\r\nevidence of the disinterested affection of the contracting parties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was not the least trace of embarrassment in his voice, and\r\nas he spoke, leaning slightly against the jamb of the window, and\r\nletting his eyes rest on her in the frank enjoyment of her grace,\r\nshe felt with a faint chill of regret that he had gone back without\r\nan effort to the footing on which they had stood before their last\r\ntalk together. Her vanity was stung by the sight of his unscathed\r\nsmile. She longed to be to him something more than a piece of\r\nsentient prettiness, a passing diversion to his eye and brain; and\r\nthe longing betrayed itself in her reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI envy Gerty that power she has of dressing\r\nup with romance all our ugly and prosaic arrangements! I have\r\nnever recovered my self-respect since you showed me how poor and\r\nunimportant my ambitions were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly spoken when she realized their infelicity. It\r\nseemed to be her fate to appear at her worst to Selden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, on the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned lightly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had been\r\nthe means of proving they were more important to you than anything\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if the eager current of her being had been checked by\r\na sudden obstacle which drove it back upon itself. She looked at\r\nhim helplessly, like a hurt or frightened child: this real self of\r\nhers, which he had the faculty of drawing out of the depths, was so\r\nlittle accustomed to go alone!\r\n\r\nThe appeal of her helplessness touched in him, as it always did,\r\na latent chord of inclination. It would have meant nothing to him\r\nto discover that his nearness made her more brilliant, but this\r\nglimpse of a twilight mood to which he alone had the clue seemed\r\nonce more to set him in a world apart with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you can\xe2\x80\x99t think worse things of me than you say!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed with a trembling laugh; but before he could answer, the\r\nflow of comprehension between them was abruptly stayed by the\r\nreappearance of Gus Trenor, who advanced with Mr. Rosedale in his\r\nwake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, Lily, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d given me the slip: Rosedale and I\r\nhave been hunting all over for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice had a note of conjugal familiarity: Miss Bart fancied she\r\ndetected in Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s eye a twinkling perception of the fact, and\r\nthe idea turned her dislike of him to repugnance.\r\n\r\nShe returned his profound bow with a slight nod, made more\r\ndisdainful by the sense of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s surprise that she should number\r\nRosedale among her acquaintances. Trenor had turned away, and his\r\ncompanion continued to stand before Miss Bart, alert and expectant,\r\nhis lips parted in a smile at whatever she might be about to say,\r\nand his very back conscious of the privilege of being seen with her.\r\n\r\nIt was the moment for tact; for the quick bridging over of gaps;\r\nbut Selden still leaned against the window, a detached observer\r\nof the scene, and under the spell of his observation Lily felt\r\nherself powerless to exert her usual arts. The dread of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspecting that there was any need for her to propitiate such a man\r\nas Rosedale checked the trivial phrases of politeness. Rosedale\r\nstill stood before her in an expectant attitude, and she continued\r\nto face him in silence, her glance just level with his polished\r\nbaldness. The look put the finishing touch to what her silence\r\nimplied.\r\n\r\nHe reddened slowly, shifting from one foot to the other, fingered\r\nthe plump black pearl in his tie, and gave a nervous twist to his\r\nmoustache; then, running his eye over her, he drew back, and said,\r\nwith a side-glance at Selden: \xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul, I never saw a more\r\nripping get-up. Is that the last creation of the dress-maker you go\r\nto see at the Benedick? If so, I wonder all the other women don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo to her too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were projected sharply against Lily\xe2\x80\x99s silence, and she\r\nsaw in a flash that her own act had given them their emphasis. In\r\nordinary talk they might have passed unheeded; but following on\r\nher prolonged pause they acquired a special meaning. She felt,\r\nwithout looking, that Selden had immediately seized it, and would\r\ninevitably connect the allusion with her visit to himself. The\r\nconsciousness increased her irritation against Rosedale, but also\r\nher feeling that now, if ever, was the moment to propitiate him,\r\nhateful as it was to do so in Selden\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know the other women don\xe2\x80\x99t go to my dress-maker?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid to give her address to my\r\nfriends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer glance and accent so plainly included Rosedale in this\r\nprivileged circle that his small eyes puckered with gratification,\r\nand a knowing smile drew up his moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could give \xe2\x80\x99em the\r\nwhole outfit and win at a canter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nice of you; and it would be nicer still if you would\r\ncarry me off to a quiet corner, and get me a glass of lemonade or\r\nsome innocent drink before we all have to rush for the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away as she spoke, letting him strut at her side through\r\nthe gathering groups on the terrace, while every nerve in her\r\nthrobbed with the consciousness of what Selden must have thought of\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nBut under her angry sense of the perverseness of things, and the\r\nlight surface of her talk with Rosedale, a third idea persisted:\r\nshe did not mean to leave without an attempt to discover the truth\r\nabout Percy Gryce. Chance, or perhaps his own resolve, had kept\r\nthem apart since his hasty withdrawal from Bellomont; but Miss\r\nBart was an expert in making the most of the unexpected, and the\r\ndistasteful incidents of the last few minutes\xe2\x80\x94the revelation to\r\nSelden of precisely that part of her life which she most wished\r\nhim to ignore\xe2\x80\x94increased her longing for shelter, for escape from\r\nsuch humiliating contingencies. Any definite situation would be\r\nmore tolerable than this buffeting of chances, which kept her in an\r\nattitude of uneasy alertness toward every possibility of life.\r\n\r\nIndoors there was a general sense of dispersal in the air, as of\r\nan audience gathering itself up for departure after the principal\r\nactors had left the stage; but among the remaining groups, Lily\r\ncould discover neither Gryce nor the youngest Miss Van Osburgh.\r\nThat both should be missing struck her with foreboding; and she\r\ncharmed Mr. Rosedale by proposing that they should make their\r\nway to the conservatories at the farther end of the house.\r\nThere were just enough people left in the long suite of rooms\r\nto make their progress conspicuous, and Lily was aware of being\r\nfollowed by looks of amusement and interrogation, which glanced\r\noff as harmlessly from her indifference as from her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-satisfaction. She cared very little at that moment about\r\nbeing seen with Rosedale: all her thoughts were centred on the\r\nobject of her search. The latter, however, was not discoverable\r\nin the conservatories, and Lily, oppressed by a sudden conviction\r\nof failure, was casting about for a way to rid herself of her\r\nnow superfluous companion, when they came upon Mrs. Van Osburgh,\r\nflushed and exhausted, but beaming with the consciousness of duty\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at them a moment with the benign but vacant eye of the\r\ntired hostess, to whom her guests have become mere whirling spots\r\nin a kaleidoscope of fatigue; then her attention became suddenly\r\nfixed, and she seized on Miss Bart with a confidential gesture.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Lily, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had time for a word with you, and now I\r\nsuppose you are just off. Have you seen Evie? She\xe2\x80\x99s been looking\r\neverywhere for you: she wanted to tell you her little secret;\r\nbut I daresay you have guessed it already. The engagement is not\r\nto be announced till next week\xe2\x80\x94but you are such a friend of Mr.\r\nGryce\xe2\x80\x99s that they both wished you to be the first to know of their\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s youth, fashion had returned to town in October;\r\ntherefore on the tenth day of the month the blinds of her Fifth\r\nAvenue residence were drawn up, and the eyes of the Dying Gladiator\r\nin bronze who occupied the drawing-room window resumed their survey\r\nof that deserted thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThe first two weeks after her return represented to Mrs. Peniston\r\nthe domestic equivalent of a religious retreat. She \xe2\x80\x9cwent through\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe linen and blankets in the precise spirit of the penitent\r\nexploring the inner folds of conscience; she sought for moths\r\nas the stricken soul seeks for lurking infirmities. The topmost\r\nshelf of every closet was made to yield up its secret, cellar and\r\ncoal-bin were probed to their darkest depths and, as a final stage\r\nin the lustral rites, the entire house was swathed in penitential\r\nwhite and deluged with expiatory soapsuds.\r\n\r\nIt was on this phase of the proceedings that Miss Bart entered\r\non the afternoon of her return from the Van Osburgh wedding. The\r\njourney back to town had not been calculated to soothe her nerves.\r\nThough Evie Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s engagement was still officially a secret,\r\nit was one of which the innumerable intimate friends of the family\r\nwere already possessed; and the trainful of returning guests buzzed\r\nwith allusions and anticipations. Lily was acutely aware of her\r\nown part in this drama of innuendo: she knew the exact quality\r\nof the amusement the situation evoked. The crude forms in which\r\nher friends took their pleasure included a loud enjoyment of such\r\ncomplications: the zest of surprising destiny in the act of playing\r\na practical joke. Lily knew well enough how to bear herself in\r\ndifficult situations. She had, to a shade, the exact manner between\r\nvictory and defeat: every insinuation was shed without an effort\r\nby the bright indifference of her manner. But she was beginning to\r\nfeel the strain of the attitude; the reaction was more rapid, and\r\nshe lapsed to a deeper self-disgust.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was always the case with her, this moral repulsion found a\r\nphysical outlet in a quickened distaste for her surroundings. She\r\nrevolted from the complacent ugliness of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s black\r\nwalnut, from the slippery gloss of the vestibule tiles, and the\r\nmingled odour of sapolio and furniture-polish that met her at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe stairs were still carpetless, and on the way up to her room she\r\nwas arrested on the landing by an encroaching tide of soapsuds.\r\nGathering up her skirts, she drew aside with an impatient gesture;\r\nand as she did so she had the odd sensation of having already found\r\nherself in the same situation but in different surroundings. It\r\nseemed to her that she was again descending the staircase from\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s rooms; and looking down to remonstrate with the dispenser\r\nof the soapy flood, she found herself met by a lifted stare which\r\nhad once before confronted her under similar circumstances. It was\r\nthe char-woman of the Benedick who, resting on crimson elbows,\r\nexamined her with the same unflinching curiosity, the same apparent\r\nreluctance to let her pass. On this occasion, however, Miss Bart\r\nwas on her own ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I wish to go by? Please move your pail,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid sharply.\r\n\r\nThe woman at first seemed not to hear; then, without a word of\r\nexcuse, she pushed back her pail and dragged a wet floor-cloth\r\nacross the landing, keeping her eyes fixed on Lily while the latter\r\nswept by. It was insufferable that Mrs. Peniston should have such\r\ncreatures about the house; and Lily entered her room resolved that\r\nthe woman should be dismissed that evening.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston, however, was at the moment inaccessible to\r\nremonstrance: since early morning she had been shut up with her\r\nmaid, going over her furs, a process which formed the culminating\r\nepisode in the drama of household renovation. In the evening also\r\nLily found herself alone, for her aunt, who rarely dined out, had\r\nresponded to the summons of a Van Alstyne cousin who was passing\r\nthrough town. The house, in its state of unnatural immaculateness\r\nand order, was as dreary as a tomb, and as Lily, turning from\r\nher brief repast between shrouded sideboards, wandered into the\r\nnewly-uncovered glare of the drawing-room she felt as though\r\nshe were buried alive in the stifling limits of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nShe usually contrived to avoid being at home during the season\r\nof domestic renewal. On the present occasion, however, a variety\r\nof reasons had combined to bring her to town; and foremost among\r\nthem was the fact that she had fewer invitations than usual for\r\nthe autumn. She had so long been accustomed to pass from one\r\ncountry-house to another, till the close of the holidays brought\r\nher friends to town, that the unfilled gaps of time confronting\r\nher produced a sharp sense of waning popularity. It was as she\r\nhad said to Selden\xe2\x80\x94people were tired of her. They would welcome\r\nher in a new character, but as Miss Bart they knew her by heart.\r\nShe knew herself by heart too, and was sick of the old story.\r\nThere were moments when she longed blindly for anything different,\r\nanything strange, remote and untried; but the utmost reach of\r\nher imagination did not go beyond picturing her usual life in a\r\nnew setting. She could not figure herself as anywhere but in a\r\ndrawing-room, diffusing elegance as a flower sheds perfume.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as October advanced she had to face the alternative\r\nof returning to the Trenors or joining her aunt in town. Even\r\nthe desolating dulness of New York in October, and the soapy\r\ndiscomforts of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s interior, seemed preferable to what\r\nmight await her at Bellomont; and with an air of heroic devotion\r\nshe announced her intention of remaining with her aunt till the\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\nSacrifices of this nature are sometimes received with feelings as\r\nmixed as those which actuate them; and Mrs. Peniston remarked to\r\nher confidential maid that, if any of the family were to be with\r\nher at such a crisis (though for forty years she had been thought\r\ncompetent to see to the hanging of her own curtains), she would\r\ncertainly have preferred Miss Grace to Miss Lily. Grace Stepney was\r\nan obscure cousin, of adaptable manners and vicarious interests,\r\nwho \xe2\x80\x9cran in\xe2\x80\x9d to sit with Mrs. Peniston when Lily dined out too\r\ncontinuously; who played bezique, picked up dropped stitches, read\r\nout the deaths from the Times, and sincerely admired the purple\r\nsatin drawing-room curtains, the Dying Gladiator in the window, and\r\nthe seven-by-five painting of Niagara which represented the one\r\nartistic excess of Mr. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s temperate career.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston, under ordinary circumstances, was as much bored by\r\nher excellent cousin as the recipient of such services usually\r\nis by the person who performs them. She greatly preferred the\r\nbrilliant and unreliable Lily, who did not know one end of a\r\ncrochet-needle from the other, and had frequently wounded her\r\nsusceptibilities by suggesting that the drawing-room should be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdone over.\xe2\x80\x9d But when it came to hunting for missing napkins, or\r\nhelping to decide whether the backstairs needed re-carpeting,\r\nGrace\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was certainly sounder than Lily\xe2\x80\x99s: not to mention\r\nthe fact that the latter resented the smell of beeswax and brown\r\nsoap, and behaved as though she thought a house ought to keep clean\r\nof itself, without extraneous assistance.\r\n\r\nSeated under the cheerless blaze of the drawing-room\r\nchandelier\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Peniston never lit the lamps unless there was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompany\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Lily seemed to watch her own figure retreating down\r\nvistas of neutral-tinted dulness to a middle-age like Grace\r\nStepney\xe2\x80\x99s. When she ceased to amuse Judy Trenor and her friends she\r\nwould have to fall back on amusing Mrs. Peniston; whichever way she\r\nlooked she saw only a future of servitude to the whims of others,\r\nnever the possibility of asserting her own eager individuality.\r\n\r\nA ring at the door-bell, sounding emphatically through the empty\r\nhouse, roused her suddenly to the extent of her boredom. It was\r\nas though all the weariness of the past months had culminated in\r\nthe vacuity of that interminable evening. If only the ring meant a\r\nsummons from the outer world\xe2\x80\x94a token that she was still remembered\r\nand wanted!\r\n\r\nAfter some delay a parlour-maid presented herself with the\r\nannouncement that there was a person outside who was asking to see\r\nMiss Bart; and on Lily\xe2\x80\x99s pressing for a more specific description,\r\nshe added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Mrs. Haffen, Miss; she won\xe2\x80\x99t say what she wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily, to whom the name conveyed nothing, opened the door upon a\r\nwoman in a battered bonnet, who stood firmly planted under the\r\nhall-light. The glare of the unshaded gas shone familiarly on her\r\npock-marked face and the reddish baldness visible through thin\r\nstrands of straw-coloured hair. Lily looked at the char-woman in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to see me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to say a word to you, Miss.\xe2\x80\x9d The tone was neither\r\naggressive nor conciliatory: it revealed nothing of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nerrand. Nevertheless, some precautionary instinct warned Lily to\r\nwithdraw beyond ear-shot of the hovering parlour-maid.\r\n\r\nShe signed to Mrs. Haffen to follow her into the drawing-room, and\r\nclosed the door when they had entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that you wish?\xe2\x80\x9d she enquired.\r\n\r\nThe char-woman, after the manner of her kind, stood with her arms\r\nfolded in her shawl. Unwinding the latter, she produced a small\r\nparcel wrapped in dirty newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something here that you might like to see, Miss Bart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe spoke the name with an unpleasant emphasis, as though her\r\nknowing it made a part of her reason for being there. To Lily the\r\nintonation sounded like a threat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have found something belonging to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, extending\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haffen drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it comes to that, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmine as much as anybody\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned.\r\n\r\nLily looked at her perplexedly. She was sure, now, that her\r\nvisitor\xe2\x80\x99s manner conveyed a threat; but, expert as she was in\r\ncertain directions, there was nothing in her experience to prepare\r\nher for the exact significance of the present scene. She felt,\r\nhowever, that it must be ended as promptly as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand; if this parcel is not mine, why have you asked\r\nfor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman was unabashed by the question. She was evidently prepared\r\nto answer it, but like all her class she had to go a long way\r\nback to make a beginning, and it was only after a pause that she\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband was janitor to the Benedick till the first of\r\nthe month; since then he can\xe2\x80\x99t get nothing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily remained silent and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t no fault of our\r\nown, neither: the agent had another man he wanted the place for,\r\nand we was put out, bag and baggage, just to suit his fancy. I had\r\na long sickness last winter, and an operation that ate up all we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nput by; and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me and the children, Haffen being so long\r\nout of a job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter all, then, she had come only to ask Miss Bart to find a\r\nplace for her husband; or, more probably, to seek the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintervention with Mrs. Peniston. Lily had such an air of always\r\ngetting what she wanted that she was used to being appealed to as\r\nan intermediary, and, relieved of her vague apprehension, she took\r\nrefuge in the conventional formula.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you have been in trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that we have, Miss, and it\xe2\x80\x99s on\xe2\x80\x99y just beginning. If on\xe2\x80\x99y we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a got another situation\xe2\x80\x94but the agent, he\xe2\x80\x99s dead against us. It\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t no fault of ours, neither, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point Lily\xe2\x80\x99s impatience overcame her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have anything\r\nto say to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed.\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s resentment of the rebuff seemed to spur her lagging\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss; I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She paused again,\r\nwith her eyes on Lily, and then continued, in a tone of diffuse\r\nnarrative: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we was at the Benedick I had charge of some of the\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s rooms; leastways, I swep\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99em out on Saturdays. Some\r\nof the gentlemen got the greatest sight of letters: I never saw\r\nthe like of it. Their waste-paper baskets \xe2\x80\x99d be fairly brimming,\r\nand papers falling over on the floor. Maybe havin\xe2\x80\x99 so many is how\r\nthey get so careless. Some of \xe2\x80\x99em is worse than others. Mr. Selden,\r\nMr. Lawrence Selden, he was always one of the carefullest: burnt\r\nhis letters in winter, and tore \xe2\x80\x99em in little bits in summer. But\r\nsometimes he\xe2\x80\x99d have so many he\xe2\x80\x99d just bunch \xe2\x80\x99em together, the way\r\nthe others did, and tear the lot through once\xe2\x80\x94like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke she had loosened the string from the parcel in her\r\nhand, and now she drew forth a letter which she laid on the table\r\nbetween Miss Bart and herself. As she had said, the letter was torn\r\nin two; but with a rapid gesture she laid the torn edges together\r\nand smoothed out the page.\r\n\r\nA wave of indignation swept over Lily. She felt herself in the\r\npresence of something vile, as yet but dimly conjectured\xe2\x80\x94the kind\r\nof vileness of which people whispered, but which she had never\r\nthought of as touching her own life. She drew back with a motion\r\nof disgust, but her withdrawal was checked by a sudden discovery:\r\nunder the glare of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s chandelier she had recognized\r\nthe hand-writing of the letter. It was a large disjointed hand,\r\nwith a flourish of masculinity which but slightly disguised\r\nits rambling weakness, and the words, scrawled in heavy ink on\r\npale-tinted notepaper, smote on Lily\xe2\x80\x99s ear as though she had heard\r\nthem spoken.\r\n\r\nAt first she did not grasp the full import of the situation. She\r\nunderstood only that before her lay a letter written by Bertha\r\nDorset, and addressed, presumably, to Lawrence Selden. There was\r\nno date, but the blackness of the ink proved the writing to be\r\ncomparatively recent. The packet in Mrs. Haffen\xe2\x80\x99s hand doubtless\r\ncontained more letters of the same kind\xe2\x80\x94a dozen, Lily conjectured\r\nfrom its thickness. The letter before her was short, but its few\r\nwords, which had leapt into her brain before she was conscious\r\nof reading them, told a long history\xe2\x80\x94a history over which, for\r\nthe last four years, the friends of the writer had smiled and\r\nshrugged, viewing it merely as one among the countless \xe2\x80\x9cgood\r\nsituations\xe2\x80\x9d of the mundane comedy. Now the other side presented\r\nitself to Lily, the volcanic nether side of the surface over which\r\nconjecture and innuendo glide so lightly till the first fissure\r\nturns their whisper to a shriek. Lily knew that there is nothing\r\nsociety resents so much as having given its protection to those who\r\nhave not known how to profit by it: it is for having betrayed its\r\nconnivance that the body social punishes the offender who is found\r\nout. And in this case there was no doubt of the issue. The code\r\nof Lily\xe2\x80\x99s world decreed that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband should be the only\r\njudge of her conduct: she was technically above suspicion while\r\nshe had the shelter of his approval, or even of his indifference.\r\nBut with a man of George Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s temper there could be no thought\r\nof condonation\xe2\x80\x94the possessor of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s letters could overthrow\r\nwith a touch the whole structure of her existence. And into what\r\nhands Bertha Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s secret had been delivered! For a moment the\r\nirony of the coincidence tinged Lily\xe2\x80\x99s disgust with a confused\r\nsense of triumph. But the disgust prevailed\xe2\x80\x94all her instinctive\r\nresistances, of taste, of training, of blind inherited scruples,\r\nrose against the other feeling. Her strongest sense was one of\r\npersonal contamination.\r\n\r\nShe moved away, as though to put as much distance as possible\r\nbetween herself and her visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of these letters,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea why you have brought them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Haffen faced her steadily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why, Miss. I brought\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em to you to sell, because I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no other way of raising\r\nmoney, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t pay our rent by tomorrow night we\xe2\x80\x99ll be put\r\nout. I never done anythin\xe2\x80\x99 of the kind before, and if you\xe2\x80\x99d speak\r\nto Mr. Selden or to Mr. Rosedale about getting Haffen taken on\r\nagain at the Benedick\xe2\x80\x94I seen you talking to Mr. Rosedale on the\r\nsteps that day you come out of Mr. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s rooms\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed to Lily\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. She understood now\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Haffen\r\nsupposed her to be the writer of the letters. In the first leap\r\nof her anger she was about to ring and order the woman out; but\r\nan obscure impulse restrained her. The mention of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nhad started a new train of thought. Bertha Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s letters were\r\nnothing to her\xe2\x80\x94they might go where the current of chance carried\r\nthem! But Selden was inextricably involved in their fate. Men\r\ndo not, at worst, suffer much from such exposure; and in this\r\ninstance the flash of divination which had carried the meaning\r\nof the letters to Lily\xe2\x80\x99s brain had revealed also that they were\r\nappeals\xe2\x80\x94repeated and therefore probably unanswered\xe2\x80\x94for the renewal\r\nof a tie which time had evidently relaxed. Nevertheless, the fact\r\nthat the correspondence had been allowed to fall into strange hands\r\nwould convict Selden of negligence in a matter where the world\r\nholds it least pardonable; and there were graver risks to consider\r\nwhere a man of Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s ticklish balance was concerned.\r\n\r\nIf she weighed all these things it was unconsciously: she was\r\naware only of feeling that Selden would wish the letters rescued,\r\nand that therefore she must obtain possession of them. Beyond\r\nthat her mind did not travel. She had, indeed, a quick vision of\r\nreturning the packet to Bertha Dorset, and of the opportunities the\r\nrestitution offered; but this thought lit up abysses from which she\r\nshrank back ashamed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mrs. Haffen, prompt to perceive her hesitation, had\r\nalready opened the packet and ranged its contents on the table. All\r\nthe letters had been pieced together with strips of thin paper.\r\nSome were in small fragments, the others merely torn in half.\r\nThough there were not many, thus spread out they nearly covered the\r\ntable. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s glance fell on a word here and there\xe2\x80\x94then she said in\r\na low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish me to pay you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Haffen\xe2\x80\x99s face reddened with satisfaction. It was clear that\r\nthe young lady was badly frightened, and Mrs. Haffen was the woman\r\nto make the most of such fears. Anticipating an easier victory than\r\nshe had foreseen, she named an exorbitant sum.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Bart showed herself a less ready prey than might have been\r\nexpected from her imprudent opening. She refused to pay the price\r\nnamed, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, met it by a counter-offer\r\nof half the amount.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haffen immediately stiffened. Her hand travelled toward the\r\noutspread letters, and folding them slowly, she made as though to\r\nrestore them to their wrapping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess they\xe2\x80\x99re worth more to you than to me, Miss, but the poor\r\nhas got to live as well as the rich,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed sententiously.\r\n\r\n\r\nLily was throbbing with fear, but the insinuation fortified her\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d she said indifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cI have offered all I\r\nam willing to give for the letters; but there may be other ways of\r\ngetting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Haffen raised a suspicious glance: she was too experienced not\r\nto know that the traffic she was engaged in had perils as great as\r\nits rewards, and she had a vision of the elaborate machinery of\r\nrevenge which a word of this commanding young lady\xe2\x80\x99s might set in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nShe applied the corner of her shawl to her eyes, and murmured\r\nthrough it that no good came of bearing too hard on the poor, but\r\nthat for her part she had never been mixed up in such a business\r\nbefore, and that on her honour as a Christian all she and Haffen\r\nhad thought of was that the letters mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go any farther.\r\n\r\nLily stood motionless, keeping between herself and the char-woman\r\nthe greatest distance compatible with the need of speaking in low\r\ntones. The idea of bargaining for the letters was intolerable to\r\nher, but she knew that, if she appeared to weaken, Mrs. Haffen\r\nwould at once increase her original demand.\r\n\r\nShe could never afterward recall how long the duel lasted, or\r\nwhat was the decisive stroke which finally, after a lapse of time\r\nrecorded in minutes by the clock, in hours by the precipitate beat\r\nof her pulses, put her in possession of the letters; she knew only\r\nthat the door had finally closed, and that she stood alone with the\r\npacket in her hand.\r\n\r\nShe had no idea of reading the letters; even to unfold Mrs.\r\nHaffen\xe2\x80\x99s dirty newspaper would have seemed degrading. But what did\r\nshe intend to do with its contents? The recipient of the letters\r\nhad meant to destroy them, and it was her duty to carry out his\r\nintention. She had no right to keep them\xe2\x80\x94to do so was to lessen\r\nwhatever merit lay in having secured their possession. But how\r\ndestroy them so effectually that there should be no second risk of\r\ntheir falling in such hands? Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s icy drawing-room grate\r\nshone with a forbidding lustre: the fire, like the lamps, was never\r\nlit except when there was company.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart was turning to carry the letters upstairs when she\r\nheard the opening of the outer door, and her aunt entered the\r\ndrawing-room. Mrs. Peniston was a small plump woman, with a\r\ncolourless skin lined with trivial wrinkles. Her grey hair was\r\narranged with precision, and her clothes looked excessively new\r\nand yet slightly old-fashioned. They were always black and tightly\r\nfitting, with an expensive glitter: she was the kind of woman who\r\nwore jet at breakfast. Lily had never seen her when she was not\r\ncuirassed in shining black, with small tight boots, and an air of\r\nbeing packed and ready to start; yet she never started.\r\n\r\nShe looked about the drawing-room with an expression of minute\r\nscrutiny. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw a streak of light under one of the blinds as I\r\ndrove up: it\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary that I can never teach that woman to\r\ndraw them down evenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving corrected the irregularity, she seated herself on one of\r\nthe glossy purple arm-chairs; Mrs. Peniston always sat on a chair,\r\nnever in it.\r\n\r\nThen she turned her glance to Miss Bart. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you look tired;\r\nI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s the excitement of the wedding. Cornelia Van Alstyne\r\nwas full of it: Molly was there, and Gerty Farish ran in for a\r\nminute to tell us about it. I think it was odd, their serving\r\nmelons before the CONSOMME: a wedding breakfast should always begin\r\nwith CONSOMME. Molly didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the bridesmaids\xe2\x80\x99 dresses. She\r\nhad it straight from Julia Melson that they cost three hundred\r\ndollars apiece at Celeste\xe2\x80\x99s, but she says they didn\xe2\x80\x99t look it. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nglad you decided not to be a bridesmaid; that shade of salmon-pink\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have suited you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Peniston delighted in discussing\r\nthe minutest details of festivities in which she had not taken\r\npart. Nothing would have induced her to undergo the exertion and\r\nfatigue of attending the Van Osburgh wedding, but so great was her\r\ninterest in the event that, having heard two versions of it, she\r\nnow prepared to extract a third from her niece. Lily, however,\r\nhad been deplorably careless in noting the particulars of the\r\nentertainment. She had failed to observe the colour of Mrs. Van\r\nOsburgh\xe2\x80\x99s gown, and could not even say whether the old Van Osburgh\r\nSevres had been used at the bride\xe2\x80\x99s table: Mrs. Peniston, in short,\r\nfound that she was of more service as a listener than as a narrator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Lily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you took the trouble to go to the\r\nwedding, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what happened or whom you saw there.\r\nWhen I was a girl I used to keep the MENU of every dinner I went\r\nto, and write the names of the people on the back; and I never\r\nthrew away my cotillion favours till after your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nwhen it seemed unsuitable to have so many coloured things about\r\nthe house. I had a whole closet-full, I remember; and I can tell\r\nto this day what balls I got them at. Molly Van Alstyne reminds me\r\nof what I was at that age; it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how she notices. She was\r\nable to tell her mother exactly how the wedding-dress was cut, and\r\nwe knew at once, from the fold in the back, that it must have come\r\nfrom Paquin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston rose abruptly, and, advancing to the ormolu\r\nclock surmounted by a helmeted Minerva, which throned on the\r\nchimney-piece between two malachite vases, passed her lace\r\nhandkerchief between the helmet and its visor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it\xe2\x80\x94the parlour-maid never dusts there!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed,\r\ntriumphantly displaying a minute spot on the handkerchief; then,\r\nreseating herself, she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cMolly thought Mrs. Dorset the\r\nbest-dressed woman at the wedding. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt her dress DID\r\ncost more than any one else\xe2\x80\x99s, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite like the idea\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncombination of sable and POINT DE MILAN. It seems she goes to a new\r\nman in Paris, who won\xe2\x80\x99t take an order till his client has spent a\r\nday with him at his villa at Neuilly. He says he must study his\r\nsubject\xe2\x80\x99s home life\xe2\x80\x94a most peculiar arrangement, I should say!\r\nBut Mrs. Dorset told Molly about it herself: she said the villa\r\nwas full of the most exquisite things and she was really sorry to\r\nleave. Molly said she never saw her looking better; she was in\r\ntremendous spirits, and said she had made a match between Evie\r\nVan Osburgh and Percy Gryce. She really seems to have a very good\r\ninfluence on young men. I hear she is interesting herself now in\r\nthat silly Silverton boy, who has had his head turned by Carry\r\nFisher, and has been gambling so dreadfully. Well, as I was saying,\r\nEvie is really engaged: Mrs. Dorset had her to stay with Percy\r\nGryce, and managed it all, and Grace Van Osburgh is in the seventh\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x94she had almost despaired of marrying Evie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston again paused, but this time her scrutiny addressed\r\nitself, not to the furniture, but to her niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCornelia Van Alstyne was so surprised: she had heard that you\r\nwere to marry young Gryce. She saw the Wetheralls just after they\r\nhad stopped with you at Bellomont, and Alice Wetherall was quite\r\nsure there was an engagement. She said that when Mr. Gryce left\r\nunexpectedly one morning, they all thought he had rushed to town\r\nfor the ring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily rose and moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I AM tired: I think I will go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and\r\nMrs. Peniston, suddenly distracted by the discovery that the easel\r\nsustaining the late Mr. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s crayon-portrait was not exactly\r\nin line with the sofa in front of it, presented an absent-minded\r\nbrow to her kiss.\r\n\r\nIn her own room Lily turned up the gas-jet and glanced toward the\r\ngrate. It was as brilliantly polished as the one below, but here at\r\nleast she could burn a few papers with less risk of incurring her\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval. She made no immediate motion to do so, however,\r\nbut dropping into a chair looked wearily about her. Her room was\r\nlarge and comfortably-furnished\xe2\x80\x94it was the envy and admiration of\r\npoor Grace Stepney, who boarded; but, contrasted with the light\r\ntints and luxurious appointments of the guest-rooms where so many\r\nweeks of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s existence were spent, it seemed as dreary as a\r\nprison. The monumental wardrobe and bedstead of black walnut had\r\nmigrated from Mr. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and the magenta \xe2\x80\x9cflock\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwall-paper, of a pattern dear to the early \xe2\x80\x99sixties, was hung with\r\nlarge steel engravings of an anecdotic character. Lily had tried to\r\nmitigate this charmless background by a few frivolous touches, in\r\nthe shape of a lace-decked toilet table and a little painted desk\r\nsurmounted by photographs; but the futility of the attempt struck\r\nher as she looked about the room. What a contrast to the subtle\r\nelegance of the setting she had pictured for herself\xe2\x80\x94an apartment\r\nwhich should surpass the complicated luxury of her friends\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsurroundings by the whole extent of that artistic sensibility\r\nwhich made her feel herself their superior; in which every tint\r\nand line should combine to enhance her beauty and give distinction\r\nto her leisure! Once more the haunting sense of physical ugliness\r\nwas intensified by her mental depression, so that each piece of\r\nthe offending furniture seemed to thrust forth its most aggressive\r\nangle.\r\n\r\nHer aunt\xe2\x80\x99s words had told her nothing new; but they had revived the\r\nvision of Bertha Dorset, smiling, flattered, victorious, holding\r\nher up to ridicule by insinuations intelligible to every member of\r\ntheir little group. The thought of the ridicule struck deeper than\r\nany other sensation: Lily knew every turn of the allusive jargon\r\nwhich could flay its victims without the shedding of blood. Her\r\ncheek burned at the recollection, and she rose and caught up the\r\nletters. She no longer meant to destroy them: that intention had\r\nbeen effaced by the quick corrosion of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\nInstead, she approached her desk, and lighting a taper, tied\r\nand sealed the packet; then she opened the wardrobe, drew out a\r\ndespatch-box, and deposited the letters within it. As she did so,\r\nit struck her with a flash of irony that she was indebted to Gus\r\nTrenor for the means of buying them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn dragged on monotonously. Miss Bart had received one or\r\ntwo notes from Judy Trenor, reproaching her for not returning to\r\nBellomont; but she replied evasively, alleging the obligation to\r\nremain with her aunt. In truth, however, she was fast wearying of\r\nher solitary existence with Mrs. Peniston, and only the excitement\r\nof spending her newly-acquired money lightened the dulness of the\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAll her life Lily had seen money go out as quickly as it came in,\r\nand whatever theories she cultivated as to the prudence of setting\r\naside a part of her gains, she had unhappily no saving vision of\r\nthe risks of the opposite course. It was a keen satisfaction to\r\nfeel that, for a few months at least, she would be independent of\r\nher friends\xe2\x80\x99 bounty, that she could show herself abroad without\r\nwondering whether some penetrating eye would detect in her dress\r\nthe traces of Judy Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s refurbished splendour. The fact that\r\nthe money freed her temporarily from all minor obligations obscured\r\nher sense of the greater one it represented, and having never\r\nbefore known what it was to command so large a sum, she lingered\r\ndelectably over the amusement of spending it.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of these occasions that, leaving a shop where she\r\nhad spent an hour of deliberation over a dressing-case of the most\r\ncomplicated elegance, she ran across Miss Farish, who had entered\r\nthe same establishment with the modest object of having her watch\r\nrepaired. Lily was feeling unusually virtuous. She had decided to\r\ndefer the purchase of the dressing-case till she should receive\r\nthe bill for her new opera cloak, and the resolve made her feel\r\nmuch richer than when she had entered the shop. In this mood of\r\nself-approval she had a sympathetic eye for others, and she was\r\nstruck by her friend\xe2\x80\x99s air of dejection.\r\n\r\nMiss Farish, it appeared, had just left the committee-meeting\r\nof a struggling charity in which she was interested. The object\r\nof the association was to provide comfortable lodgings, with a\r\nreading-room and other modest distractions, where young women of\r\nthe class employed in downtown offices might find a home when\r\nout of work, or in need of rest, and the first year\xe2\x80\x99s financial\r\nreport showed so deplorably small a balance that Miss Farish, who\r\nwas convinced of the urgency of the work, felt proportionately\r\ndiscouraged by the small amount of interest it aroused. The\r\nother-regarding sentiments had not been cultivated in Lily, and\r\nshe was often bored by the relation of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s philanthropic\r\nefforts, but today her quick dramatizing fancy seized on the\r\ncontrast between her own situation and that represented by some of\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccases.\xe2\x80\x9d These were young girls, like herself; some perhaps\r\npretty, some not without a trace of her finer sensibilities. She\r\npictured herself leading such a life as theirs\xe2\x80\x94a life in which\r\nachievement seemed as squalid as failure\xe2\x80\x94and the vision made her\r\nshudder sympathetically. The price of the dressing-case was still\r\nin her pocket; and drawing out her little gold purse she slipped a\r\nliberal fraction of the amount into Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction derived from this act was all that the most ardent\r\nmoralist could have desired. Lily felt a new interest in herself as\r\na person of charitable instincts: she had never before thought of\r\ndoing good with the wealth she had so often dreamed of possessing,\r\nbut now her horizon was enlarged by the vision of a prodigal\r\nphilanthropy. Moreover, by some obscure process of logic, she felt\r\nthat her momentary burst of generosity had justified all previous\r\nextravagances, and excused any in which she might subsequently\r\nindulge. Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s surprise and gratitude confirmed this\r\nfeeling, and Lily parted from her with a sense of self-esteem which\r\nshe naturally mistook for the fruits of altruism.\r\n\r\nAbout this time she was farther cheered by an invitation to spend\r\nthe Thanksgiving week at a camp in the Adirondacks. The invitation\r\nwas one which, a year earlier, would have provoked a less ready\r\nresponse, for the party, though organized by Mrs. Fisher, was\r\nostensibly given by a lady of obscure origin and indomitable social\r\nambitions, whose acquaintance Lily had hitherto avoided. Now,\r\nhowever, she was disposed to coincide with Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s view, that\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter who gave the party, as long as things were well\r\ndone; and doing things well (under competent direction) was Mrs.\r\nWellington Bry\xe2\x80\x99s strong point. The lady (whose consort was known\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cWelly\xe2\x80\x9d Bry on the Stock Exchange and in sporting circles) had\r\nalready sacrificed one husband, and sundry minor considerations, to\r\nher determination to get on; and, having obtained a hold on Carry\r\nFisher, she was astute enough to perceive the wisdom of committing\r\nherself entirely to that lady\xe2\x80\x99s guidance. Everything, accordingly,\r\nwas well done, for there was no limit to Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s prodigality\r\nwhen she was not spending her own money, and as she remarked to her\r\npupil, a good cook was the best introduction to society. If the\r\ncompany was not as select as the CUISINE, the Welly Brys at least\r\nhad the satisfaction of figuring for the first time in the society\r\ncolumns in company with one or two noticeable names; and foremost\r\namong these was of course Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s. The young lady was treated\r\nby her hosts with corresponding deference; and she was in the mood\r\nwhen such attentions are acceptable, whatever their source. Mrs.\r\nBry\xe2\x80\x99s admiration was a mirror in which Lily\xe2\x80\x99s self-complacency\r\nrecovered its lost outline. No insect hangs its nest on threads\r\nas frail as those which will sustain the weight of human vanity;\r\nand the sense of being of importance among the insignificant was\r\nenough to restore to Miss Bart the gratifying consciousness of\r\npower. If these people paid court to her it proved that she was\r\nstill conspicuous in the world to which they aspired; and she was\r\nnot above a certain enjoyment in dazzling them by her fineness, in\r\ndeveloping their puzzled perception of her superiorities.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, her enjoyment proceeded more than she was aware\r\nfrom the physical stimulus of the excursion, the challenge of crisp\r\ncold and hard exercise, the responsive thrill of her body to the\r\ninfluences of the winter woods. She returned to town in a glow\r\nof rejuvenation, conscious of a clearer colour in her cheeks, a\r\nfresh elasticity in her muscles. The future seemed full of a vague\r\npromise, and all her apprehensions were swept out of sight on the\r\nbuoyant current of her mood.\r\n\r\nA few days after her return to town she had the unpleasant surprise\r\nof a visit from Mr. Rosedale. He came late, at the confidential\r\nhour when the tea-table still lingers by the fire in friendly\r\nexpectancy; and his manner showed a readiness to adapt itself to\r\nthe intimacy of the occasion.\r\n\r\nLily, who had a vague sense of his being somehow connected with her\r\nlucky speculations, tried to give him the welcome he expected; but\r\nthere was something in the quality of his geniality which chilled\r\nher own, and she was conscious of marking each step in their\r\nacquaintance by a fresh blunder.\r\n\r\nMr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x94making himself promptly at home in an adjoining\r\neasy-chair, and sipping his tea critically, with the comment: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nought to go to my man for something really good\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94appeared totally\r\nunconscious of the repugnance which kept her in frozen erectness\r\nbehind the urn. It was perhaps her very manner of holding herself\r\naloof that appealed to his collector\xe2\x80\x99s passion for the rare and\r\nunattainable. He gave, at any rate, no sign of resenting it and\r\nseemed prepared to supply in his own manner all the ease that was\r\nlacking in hers.\r\n\r\nHis object in calling was to ask her to go to the opera in his box\r\non the opening night, and seeing her hesitate he said persuasively:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fisher is coming, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve secured a tremendous admirer of\r\nyours, who\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgive me if you don\xe2\x80\x99t accept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Lily\xe2\x80\x99s silence left him with this allusion on his hands, he\r\nadded with a confidential smile: \xe2\x80\x9cGus Trenor has promised to come\r\nto town on purpose. I fancy he\xe2\x80\x99d go a good deal farther for the\r\npleasure of seeing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart felt an inward motion of annoyance: it was distasteful\r\nenough to hear her name coupled with Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s, and on Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips the allusion was peculiarly unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Trenors are my best friends\xe2\x80\x94I think we should all go a\r\nlong way to see each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, absorbing herself in the\r\npreparation of fresh tea.\r\n\r\nHer visitor\xe2\x80\x99s smile grew increasingly intimate. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthinking of Mrs. Trenor at the moment\xe2\x80\x94they say Gus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, dimly conscious that he had not struck the right\r\nnote, he added, with a well-meant effort at diversion: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nluck been going in Wall Street, by the way? I hear Gus pulled off a\r\nnice little pile for you last month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily put down the tea-caddy with an abrupt gesture. She felt that\r\nher hands were trembling, and clasped them on her knee to steady\r\nthem; but her lip trembled too, and for a moment she was afraid\r\nthe tremor might communicate itself to her voice. When she spoke,\r\nhowever, it was in a tone of perfect lightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes\xe2\x80\x94I had a little bit of money to invest, and Mr. Trenor,\r\nwho helps me about such matters, advised my putting it in stocks\r\ninstead of a mortgage, as my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s agent wanted me to do; and as\r\nit happened, I made a lucky \xe2\x80\x98turn\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94is that what you call it? For\r\nyou make a great many yourself, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was smiling back at him now, relaxing the tension of her\r\nattitude, and admitting him, by imperceptible gradations of glance\r\nand manner, a step farther toward intimacy. The protective instinct\r\nalways nerved her to successful dissimulation, and it was not the\r\nfirst time she had used her beauty to divert attention from an\r\ninconvenient topic.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Rosedale took leave, he carried with him, not only her\r\nacceptance of his invitation, but a general sense of having\r\ncomported himself in a way calculated to advance his cause. He\r\nhad always believed he had a light touch and a knowing way with\r\nwomen, and the prompt manner in which Miss Bart (as he would have\r\nphrased it) had \xe2\x80\x9ccome into line,\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed his confidence in his\r\npowers of handling this skittish sex. Her way of glossing over the\r\ntransaction with Trenor he regarded at once as a tribute to his\r\nown acuteness, and a confirmation of his suspicions. The girl was\r\nevidently nervous, and Mr. Rosedale, if he saw no other means of\r\nadvancing his acquaintance with her, was not above taking advantage\r\nof her nervousness.\r\n\r\nHe left Lily to a passion of disgust and fear. It seemed incredible\r\nthat Gus Trenor should have spoken of her to Rosedale. With\r\nall his faults, Trenor had the safeguard of his traditions,\r\nand was the less likely to overstep them because they were so\r\npurely instinctive. But Lily recalled with a pang that there\r\nwere convivial moments when, as Judy had confided to her, Gus\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctalked foolishly\xe2\x80\x9d: in one of these, no doubt, the fatal word had\r\nslipped from him. As for Rosedale, she did not, after the first\r\nshock, greatly care what conclusions he had drawn. Though usually\r\nadroit enough where her own interests were concerned, she made\r\nthe mistake, not uncommon to persons in whom the social habits\r\nare instinctive, of supposing that the inability to acquire them\r\nquickly implies a general dulness. Because a blue-bottle bangs\r\nirrationally against a window-pane, the drawing-room naturalist\r\nmay forget that under less artificial conditions it is capable\r\nof measuring distances and drawing conclusions with all the\r\naccuracy needful to its welfare; and the fact that Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room manner lacked perspective made Lily class him with\r\nTrenor and the other dull men she knew, and assume that a little\r\nflattery, and the occasional acceptance of his hospitality, would\r\nsuffice to render him innocuous. However, there could be no doubt\r\nof the expediency of showing herself in his box on the opening\r\nnight of the opera; and after all, since Judy Trenor had promised\r\nto take him up that winter, it was as well to reap the advantage of\r\nbeing first in the field.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two after Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s visit, Lily\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were\r\ndogged by the consciousness of Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s shadowy claim, and she\r\nwished she had a clearer notion of the exact nature of the\r\ntransaction which seemed to have put her in his power; but her mind\r\nshrank from any unusual application, and she was always helplessly\r\npuzzled by figures. Moreover she had not seen Trenor since the day\r\nof the Van Osburgh wedding, and in his continued absence the trace\r\nof Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s words was soon effaced by other impressions.\r\n\r\nWhen the opening night of the opera came, her apprehensions had so\r\ncompletely vanished that the sight of Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s ruddy countenance in\r\nthe back of Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s box filled her with a sense of pleasant\r\nreassurance. Lily had not quite reconciled herself to the necessity\r\nof appearing as Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s guest on so conspicuous an occasion, and\r\nit was a relief to find herself supported by any one of her own\r\nset\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s social habits were too promiscuous for her\r\npresence to justify Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nTo Lily, always inspirited by the prospect of showing her beauty\r\nin public, and conscious tonight of all the added enhancements of\r\ndress, the insistency of Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s gaze merged itself in the general\r\nstream of admiring looks of which she felt herself the centre. Ah,\r\nit was good to be young, to be radiant, to glow with the sense of\r\nslenderness, strength and elasticity, of well-poised lines and\r\nhappy tints, to feel one\xe2\x80\x99s self lifted to a height apart by that\r\nincommunicable grace which is the bodily counterpart of genius!\r\n\r\nAll means seemed justifiable to attain such an end, or rather, by a\r\nhappy shifting of lights with which practice had familiarized Miss\r\nBart, the cause shrank to a pin-point in the general brightness\r\nof the effect. But brilliant young ladies, a little blinded by\r\ntheir own effulgence, are apt to forget that the modest satellite\r\ndrowned in their light is still performing its own revolutions\r\nand generating heat at its own rate. If Lily\xe2\x80\x99s poetic enjoyment\r\nof the moment was undisturbed by the base thought that her gown\r\nand opera cloak had been indirectly paid for by Gus Trenor, the\r\nlatter had not sufficient poetry in his composition to lose sight\r\nof these prosaic facts. He knew only that he had never seen Lily\r\nlook smarter in her life, that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a woman in the house\r\nwho showed off good clothes as she did, and that hitherto he, to\r\nwhom she owed the opportunity of making this display, had reaped no\r\nreturn beyond that of gazing at her in company with several hundred\r\nother pairs of eyes.\r\n\r\nIt came to Lily therefore as a disagreeable surprise when, in\r\nthe back of the box, where they found themselves alone between\r\ntwo acts, Trenor said, without preamble, and in a tone of sulky\r\nauthority: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Lily, how is a fellow ever to see anything\r\nof you? I\xe2\x80\x99m in town three or four days in the week, and you know\r\na line to the club will always find me, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nremember my existence nowadays unless you want to get a tip out of\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact that the remark was in distinctly bad taste did not make\r\nit any easier to answer, for Lily was vividly aware that it was not\r\nthe moment for that drawing up of her slim figure and surprised\r\nlifting of the brows by which she usually quelled incipient signs\r\nof familiarity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very much flattered by your wanting to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned,\r\nessaying lightness instead, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, unless you have mislaid my\r\naddress, it would have been easy to find me any afternoon at my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94in fact, I rather expected you to look me up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf she hoped to mollify him by this last concession the attempt\r\nwas a failure, for he only replied, with the familiar lowering of\r\nthe brows that made him look his dullest when he was angry: \xe2\x80\x9cHang\r\ngoing to your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, and wasting the afternoon listening to a lot\r\nof other chaps talking to you! You know I\xe2\x80\x99m not the kind to sit\r\nin a crowd and jaw\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d always rather clear out when that sort of\r\ncircus is going on. But why can\xe2\x80\x99t we go off somewhere on a little\r\nlark together\xe2\x80\x94a nice quiet little expedition like that drive at\r\nBellomont, the day you met me at the station?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned unpleasantly close in order to convey this suggestion,\r\nand she fancied she caught a significant aroma which explained the\r\ndark flush on his face and the glistening dampness of his forehead.\r\n\r\nThe idea that any rash answer might provoke an unpleasant outburst\r\ntempered her disgust with caution, and she answered with a laugh:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how one can very well take country drives in town, but\r\nI am not always surrounded by an admiring throng, and if you will\r\nlet me know what afternoon you are coming I will arrange things so\r\nthat we can have a nice quiet talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang talking! That\xe2\x80\x99s what you always say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Trenor, whose\r\nexpletives lacked variety. \xe2\x80\x9cYou put me off with that at the Van\r\nOsburgh wedding\xe2\x80\x94but the plain English of it is that, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot what you wanted out of me, you\xe2\x80\x99d rather have any other fellow\r\nabout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice had risen sharply with the last words, and Lily flushed\r\nwith annoyance, but she kept command of the situation and laid a\r\npersuasive hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish, Gus; I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you talk to me in that\r\nridiculous way. If you really want to see me, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\ntake a walk in the Park some afternoon? I agree with you that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namusing to be rustic in town, and if you like I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you there,\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and feed the squirrels, and you shall take me out on\r\nthe lake in the steam-gondola.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled as she spoke, letting her eyes rest on his in a way that\r\ntook the edge from her banter and made him suddenly malleable to\r\nher will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then: that\xe2\x80\x99s a go. Will you come tomorrow? Tomorrow\r\nat three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the end of the Mall. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there sharp,\r\nremember; you won\xe2\x80\x99t go back on me, Lily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s relief the repetition of her promise was cut\r\nshort by the opening of the box door to admit George Dorset.\r\n\r\nTrenor sulkily yielded his place, and Lily turned a brilliant smile\r\non the newcomer. She had not talked with Dorset since their visit\r\nat Bellomont, but something in his look and manner told her that\r\nhe recalled the friendly footing on which they had last met. He\r\nwas not a man to whom the expression of admiration came easily:\r\nhis long sallow face and distrustful eyes seemed always barricaded\r\nagainst the expansive emotions. But, where her own influence was\r\nconcerned, Lily\xe2\x80\x99s intuitions sent out thread-like feelers, and as\r\nshe made room for him on the narrow sofa she was sure he found a\r\ndumb pleasure in being near her. Few women took the trouble to\r\nmake themselves agreeable to Dorset, and Lily had been kind to him\r\nat Bellomont, and was now smiling on him with a divine renewal of\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, here we are, in for another six months of caterwauling,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe began complainingly. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a shade of difference between this\r\nyear and last, except that the women have got new clothes and the\r\nsingers haven\xe2\x80\x99t got new voices. My wife\xe2\x80\x99s musical, you know\xe2\x80\x94puts me\r\nthrough a course of this every winter. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad on Italian\r\nnights\xe2\x80\x94then she comes late, and there\xe2\x80\x99s time to digest. But when\r\nthey give Wagner we have to rush dinner, and I pay up for it. And\r\nthe draughts are damnable\xe2\x80\x94asphyxia in front and pleurisy in the\r\nback. There\xe2\x80\x99s Trenor leaving the box without drawing the curtain!\r\nWith a hide like that draughts don\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference. Did you\r\never watch Trenor eat? If you did, you\xe2\x80\x99d wonder why he\xe2\x80\x99s alive; I\r\nsuppose he\xe2\x80\x99s leather inside too.\xe2\x80\x94But I came to say that my wife\r\nwants you to come down to our place next Sunday. Do for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake say yes. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of bores coming\xe2\x80\x94intellectual ones,\r\nI mean; that\xe2\x80\x99s her new line, you know, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworse than the music. Some of \xe2\x80\x99em have long hair, and they start\r\nan argument with the soup, and don\xe2\x80\x99t notice when things are handed\r\nto them. The consequence is the dinner gets cold, and I have\r\ndyspepsia. That silly ass Silverton brings them to the house\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwrites poetry, you know, and Bertha and he are getting tremendously\r\nthick. She could write better than any of \xe2\x80\x99em if she chose, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t blame her for wanting clever fellows about; all I say is:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me see \xe2\x80\x99em eat!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gist of this strange communication gave Lily a distinct thrill\r\nof pleasure. Under ordinary circumstances, there would have been\r\nnothing surprising in an invitation from Bertha Dorset; but since\r\nthe Bellomont episode an unavowed hostility had kept the two women\r\napart. Now, with a start of inner wonder, Lily felt that her thirst\r\nfor retaliation had died out. IF YOU WOULD FORGIVE YOUR ENEMY,\r\nsays the Malay proverb, FIRST INFLICT A HURT ON HIM; and Lily was\r\nexperiencing the truth of the apothegm. If she had destroyed Mrs.\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s letters, she might have continued to hate her; but the\r\nfact that they remained in her possession had fed her resentment to\r\nsatiety.\r\n\r\nShe uttered a smiling acceptance, hailing in the renewal of the tie\r\nan escape from Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s importunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the holidays had gone by and the season was beginning.\r\nFifth Avenue had become a nightly torrent of carriages surging\r\nupward to the fashionable quarters about the Park, where\r\nilluminated windows and outspread awnings betokened the usual\r\nroutine of hospitality. Other tributary currents crossed the\r\nmainstream, bearing their freight to the theatres, restaurants or\r\nopera; and Mrs. Peniston, from the secluded watch-tower of her\r\nupper window, could tell to a nicety just when the chronic volume\r\nof sound was increased by the sudden influx setting toward a Van\r\nOsburgh ball, or when the multiplication of wheels meant merely\r\nthat the opera was over, or that there was a big supper at Sherry\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston followed the rise and culmination of the season\r\nas keenly as the most active sharer in its gaieties; and,\r\nas a looker-on, she enjoyed opportunities of comparison and\r\ngeneralization such as those who take part must proverbially\r\nforego. No one could have kept a more accurate record of\r\nsocial fluctuations, or have put a more unerring finger on\r\nthe distinguishing features of each season: its dulness, its\r\nextravagance, its lack of balls or excess of divorces. She had a\r\nspecial memory for the vicissitudes of the \xe2\x80\x9cnew people\xe2\x80\x9d who rose\r\nto the surface with each recurring tide, and were either submerged\r\nbeneath its rush or landed triumphantly beyond the reach of envious\r\nbreakers; and she was apt to display a remarkable retrospective\r\ninsight into their ultimate fate, so that, when they had fulfilled\r\ntheir destiny, she was almost always able to say to Grace\r\nStepney\xe2\x80\x94the recipient of her prophecies\xe2\x80\x94that she had known exactly\r\nwhat would happen.\r\n\r\nThis particular season Mrs. Peniston would have characterized as\r\nthat in which everybody \xe2\x80\x9cfelt poor\xe2\x80\x9d except the Welly Brys and Mr.\r\nSimon Rosedale. It had been a bad autumn in Wall Street, where\r\nprices fell in accordance with that peculiar law which proves\r\nrailway stocks and bales of cotton to be more sensitive to the\r\nallotment of executive power than many estimable citizens trained\r\nto all the advantages of self-government. Even fortunes supposed to\r\nbe independent of the market either betrayed a secret dependence on\r\nit, or suffered from a sympathetic affection: fashion sulked in its\r\ncountry houses, or came to town incognito, general entertainments\r\nwere discountenanced, and informality and short dinners became the\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nBut society, amused for a while at playing Cinderella, soon\r\nwearied of the hearthside role, and welcomed the Fairy Godmother\r\nin the shape of any magician powerful enough to turn the shrunken\r\npumpkin back again into the golden coach. The mere fact of growing\r\nricher at a time when most people\xe2\x80\x99s investments are shrinking, is\r\ncalculated to attract envious attention; and according to Wall\r\nStreet rumours, Welly Bry and Rosedale had found the secret of\r\nperforming this miracle.\r\n\r\nRosedale, in particular, was said to have doubled his fortune, and\r\nthere was talk of his buying the newly-finished house of one of the\r\nvictims of the crash, who, in the space of twelve short months, had\r\nmade the same number of millions, built a house in Fifth Avenue,\r\nfilled a picture gallery with old masters, entertained all New\r\nYork in it, and been smuggled out of the country between a trained\r\nnurse and a doctor, while his creditors mounted guard over the old\r\nmasters, and his guests explained to each other that they had dined\r\nwith him only because they wanted to see the pictures. Mr. Rosedale\r\nmeant to have a less meteoric career. He knew he should have to\r\ngo slowly, and the instincts of his race fitted him to suffer\r\nrebuffs and put up with delays. But he was prompt to perceive\r\nthat the general dulness of the season afforded him an unusual\r\nopportunity to shine, and he set about with patient industry to\r\nform a background for his growing glory. Mrs. Fisher was of immense\r\nservice to him at this period. She had set off so many newcomers\r\non the social stage that she was like one of those pieces of stock\r\nscenery which tell the experienced spectator exactly what is going\r\nto take place. But Mr. Rosedale wanted, in the long run, a more\r\nindividual environment. He was sensitive to shades of difference\r\nwhich Miss Bart would never have credited him with perceiving,\r\nbecause he had no corresponding variations of manner; and it\r\nwas becoming more and more clear to him that Miss Bart herself\r\npossessed precisely the complementary qualities needed to round off\r\nhis social personality.\r\n\r\nSuch details did not fall within the range of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvision. Like many minds of panoramic sweep, hers was apt to\r\noverlook the MINUTIAE of the foreground, and she was much more\r\nlikely to know where Carry Fisher had found the Welly Brys\xe2\x80\x99 CHEF\r\nfor them, than what was happening to her own niece. She was not,\r\nhowever, without purveyors of information ready to supplement\r\nher deficiencies. Grace Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s mind was like a kind of moral\r\nfly-paper, to which the buzzing items of gossip were drawn by a\r\nfatal attraction, and where they hung fast in the toils of an\r\ninexorable memory. Lily would have been surprised to know how many\r\ntrivial facts concerning herself were lodged in Miss Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead. She was quite aware that she was of interest to dingy people,\r\nbut she assumed that there is only one form of dinginess, and\r\nthat admiration for brilliancy is the natural expression of its\r\ninferior state. She knew that Gerty Farish admired her blindly, and\r\ntherefore supposed that she inspired the same sentiments in Grace\r\nStepney, whom she classified as a Gerty Farish without the saving\r\ntraits of youth and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the two differed from each other as much as they\r\ndiffered from the object of their mutual contemplation. Miss\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s heart was a fountain of tender illusions, Miss Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na precise register of facts as manifested in their relation to\r\nherself. She had sensibilities which, to Lily, would have seemed\r\ncomic in a person with a freckled nose and red eyelids, who lived\r\nin a boarding-house and admired Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room; but\r\npoor Grace\xe2\x80\x99s limitations gave them a more concentrated inner life,\r\nas poor soil starves certain plants into intenser efflorescence.\r\nShe had in truth no abstract propensity to malice: she did not\r\ndislike Lily because the latter was brilliant and predominant,\r\nbut because she thought that Lily disliked her. It is less\r\nmortifying to believe one\xe2\x80\x99s self unpopular than insignificant, and\r\nvanity prefers to assume that indifference is a latent form of\r\nunfriendliness. Even such scant civilities as Lily accorded to Mr.\r\nRosedale would have made Miss Stepney her friend for life; but how\r\ncould she foresee that such a friend was worth cultivating? How,\r\nmoreover, can a young woman who has never been ignored measure\r\nthe pang which this injury inflicts? And, lastly, how could Lily,\r\naccustomed to choose between a pressure of engagements, guess\r\nthat she had mortally offended Miss Stepney by causing her to be\r\nexcluded from one of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s infrequent dinner-parties?\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston disliked giving dinners, but she had a high sense\r\nof family obligation, and on the Jack Stepneys\xe2\x80\x99 return from their\r\nhoneymoon she felt it incumbent upon her to light the drawing-room\r\nlamps and extract her best silver from the Safe Deposit vaults.\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s rare entertainments were preceded by days of\r\nheart-rending vacillation as to every detail of the feast, from\r\nthe seating of the guests to the pattern of the table-cloth, and\r\nin the course of one of these preliminary discussions she had\r\nimprudently suggested to her cousin Grace that, as the dinner was a\r\nfamily affair, she might be included in it. For a week the prospect\r\nhad lighted up Miss Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s colourless existence; then she had\r\nbeen given to understand that it would be more convenient to have\r\nher another day. Miss Stepney knew exactly what had happened.\r\nLily, to whom family reunions were occasions of unalloyed dulness,\r\nhad persuaded her aunt that a dinner of \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d people would be\r\nmuch more to the taste of the young couple, and Mrs. Peniston,\r\nwho leaned helplessly on her niece in social matters, had been\r\nprevailed upon to pronounce Grace\xe2\x80\x99s exile. After all, Grace could\r\ncome any other day; why should she mind being put off?\r\n\r\nIt was precisely because Miss Stepney could come any other day\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nbecause she knew her relations were in the secret of her unoccupied\r\nevenings\xe2\x80\x94that this incident loomed gigantically on her horizon. She\r\nwas aware that she had Lily to thank for it; and dull resentment\r\nwas turned to active animosity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston, on whom she had looked in a day or two after the\r\ndinner, laid down her crochet-work and turned abruptly from her\r\noblique survey of Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGus Trenor?\xe2\x80\x94Lily and Gus Trenor?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, growing so suddenly\r\npale that her visitor was almost alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, cousin Julia . . . of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you DO mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Peniston, with a\r\nfrightened quiver in her small fretful voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch things were\r\nnever heard of in my day. And my own niece! I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I\r\nunderstand you. Do people say he\xe2\x80\x99s in love with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s horror was genuine. Though she boasted an\r\nunequalled familiarity with the secret chronicles of society, she\r\nhad the innocence of the school-girl who regards wickedness as a\r\npart of \xe2\x80\x9chistory,\xe2\x80\x9d and to whom it never occurs that the scandals\r\nshe reads of in lesson-hours may be repeating themselves in the\r\nnext street. Mrs. Peniston had kept her imagination shrouded, like\r\nthe drawing-room furniture. She knew, of course, that society was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cvery much changed,\xe2\x80\x9d and that many women her mother would have\r\nthought \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar\xe2\x80\x9d were now in a position to be critical about\r\ntheir visiting-lists; she had discussed the perils of divorce with\r\nher rector, and had felt thankful at times that Lily was still\r\nunmarried; but the idea that any scandal could attach to a young\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s name, above all that it could be lightly coupled with that\r\nof a married man, was so new to her that she was as much aghast as\r\nif she had been accused of leaving her carpets down all summer, or\r\nof violating any of the other cardinal laws of house-keeping.\r\n\r\nMiss Stepney, when her first fright had subsided, began to feel\r\nthe superiority that greater breadth of mind confers. It was\r\nreally pitiable to be as ignorant of the world as Mrs. Peniston!\r\nShe smiled at the latter\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople always say unpleasant\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94and certainly they\xe2\x80\x99re a great deal together. A friend of\r\nmine met them the other afternoon in the Park\xe2\x80\x94quite late, after the\r\nlamps were lit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity Lily makes herself so conspicuous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCONSPICUOUS!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mrs. Peniston. She bent forward, lowering her\r\nvoice to mitigate the horror. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of things do they say?\r\nThat he means to get a divorce and marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGrace Stepney laughed outright. \xe2\x80\x9cDear me, no! He would hardly do\r\nthat. It\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a flirtation\xe2\x80\x94nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA flirtation? Between my niece and a married man? Do you mean to\r\ntell me that, with Lily\xe2\x80\x99s looks and advantages, she could find no\r\nbetter use for her time than to waste it on a fat stupid man almost\r\nold enough to be her father?\xe2\x80\x9d This argument had such a convincing\r\nring that it gave Mrs. Peniston sufficient reassurance to pick up\r\nher work, while she waited for Grace Stepney to rally her scattered\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Stepney was on the spot in an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the worst\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94people say she isn\xe2\x80\x99t wasting her time! Every one knows, as\r\nyou say, that Lily is too handsome and\xe2\x80\x94and charming\xe2\x80\x94to devote\r\nherself to a man like Gus Trenor unless\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mrs. Peniston. Her visitor drew breath nervously.\r\nIt was agreeable to shock Mrs. Peniston, but not to shock her to\r\nthe verge of anger. Miss Stepney was not sufficiently familiar\r\nwith the classic drama to have recalled in advance how bearers\r\nof bad tidings are proverbially received, but she now had a\r\nrapid vision of forfeited dinners and a reduced wardrobe as the\r\npossible consequence of her disinterestedness. To the honour of\r\nher sex, however, hatred of Lily prevailed over more personal\r\nconsiderations. Mrs. Peniston had chosen the wrong moment to boast\r\nof her niece\xe2\x80\x99s charms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, leaning forward to speak with low-toned\r\nemphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cunless there are material advantages to be gained by\r\nmaking herself agreeable to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt that the moment was tremendous, and remembered suddenly\r\nthat Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s black brocade, with the cut jet fringe, would\r\nhave been hers at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston put down her work again. Another aspect of the same\r\nidea had presented itself to her, and she felt that it was beneath\r\nher dignity to have her nerves racked by a dependent relative who\r\nwore her old clothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you take pleasure in annoying me by mysterious insinuations,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou might at least have chosen a more suitable\r\ntime than just as I am recovering from the strain of giving a large\r\ndinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mention of the dinner dispelled Miss Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s last scruples.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I should be accused of taking pleasure in telling\r\nyou about Lily. I was sure I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any thanks for it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreturned with a flare of temper. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have some family feeling\r\nleft, and as you are the only person who has any authority over\r\nLily, I thought you ought to know what is being said of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Peniston, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I complain of is that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntold me yet what IS being said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I should have to put it so plainly. People say\r\nthat Gus Trenor pays her bills.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPays her bills\xe2\x80\x94her bills?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Peniston broke into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t imagine where you can have picked up such rubbish. Lily has\r\nher own income\xe2\x80\x94and I provide for her very handsomely\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we all know that,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Stepney drily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Lily\r\nwears a great many smart gowns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like her to be well-dressed\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only suitable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; but then there are her gambling debts besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Stepney, in the beginning, had not meant to bring up this\r\npoint; but Mrs. Peniston had only her own incredulity to blame. She\r\nwas like the stiff-necked unbelievers of Scripture, who must be\r\nannihilated to be convinced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGambling debts? Lily?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s voice shook with anger and\r\nbewilderment. She wondered whether Grace Stepney had gone out of\r\nher mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by her gambling debts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply that if one plays bridge for money in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s set one is\r\nliable to lose a great deal\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose Lily always wins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that my niece played cards for money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy, cousin Julia, don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me as if I were trying to turn\r\nyou against Lily! Everybody knows she is crazy about bridge. Mrs.\r\nGryce told me herself that it was her gambling that frightened\r\nPercy Gryce\xe2\x80\x94it seems he was really taken with her at first. But,\r\nof course, among Lily\xe2\x80\x99s friends it\xe2\x80\x99s quite the custom for girls to\r\nplay for money. In fact, people are inclined to excuse her on that\r\naccount\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo excuse her for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor being hard up\xe2\x80\x94and accepting attentions from men like Gus\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x94and George Dorset\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston gave another cry. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Dorset? Is there any one\r\nelse? I should like to know the worst, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it in that way, cousin Julia. Lately Lily has been a\r\ngood deal with the Dorsets, and he seems to admire her\xe2\x80\x94but of\r\ncourse that\xe2\x80\x99s only natural. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is no truth in the\r\nhorrid things people say; but she HAS been spending a great deal\r\nof money this winter. Evie Van Osburgh was at Celeste\xe2\x80\x99s ordering\r\nher trousseau the other day\xe2\x80\x94yes, the marriage takes place next\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94and she told me that Celeste showed her the most exquisite\r\nthings she was just sending home to Lily. And people say that Judy\r\nTrenor has quarrelled with her on account of Gus; but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry I spoke, though I only meant it as a kindness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s genuine incredulity enabled her to dismiss Miss\r\nStepney with a disdain which boded ill for that lady\xe2\x80\x99s prospect of\r\nsucceeding to the black brocade; but minds impenetrable to reason\r\nhave generally some crack through which suspicion filters, and\r\nher visitor\xe2\x80\x99s insinuations did not glide off as easily as she had\r\nexpected. Mrs. Peniston disliked scenes, and her determination\r\nto avoid them had always led her to hold herself aloof from the\r\ndetails of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s life. In her youth, girls had not been supposed\r\nto require close supervision. They were generally assumed to be\r\ntaken up with the legitimate business of courtship and marriage,\r\nand interference in such affairs on the part of their natural\r\nguardians was considered as unwarrantable as a spectator\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly\r\njoining in a game. There had of course been \xe2\x80\x9cfast\xe2\x80\x9d girls even in\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s early experience; but their fastness, at worst, was\r\nunderstood to be a mere excess of animal spirits, against which\r\nthere could be no graver charge than that of being \xe2\x80\x9cunladylike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe modern fastness appeared synonymous with immorality, and the\r\nmere idea of immorality was as offensive to Mrs. Peniston as a\r\nsmell of cooking in the drawing-room: it was one of the conceptions\r\nher mind refused to admit.\r\n\r\nShe had no immediate intention of repeating to Lily what she\r\nhad heard, or even of trying to ascertain its truth by means of\r\ndiscreet interrogation. To do so might be to provoke a scene; and\r\na scene, in the shaken state of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s nerves, with the\r\neffects of her dinner not worn off, and her mind still tremulous\r\nwith new impressions, was a risk she deemed it her duty to avoid.\r\nBut there remained in her thoughts a settled deposit of resentment\r\nagainst her niece, all the denser because it was not to be cleared\r\nby explanation or discussion. It was horrible of a young girl to\r\nlet herself be talked about; however unfounded the charges against\r\nher, she must be to blame for their having been made. Mrs. Peniston\r\nfelt as if there had been a contagious illness in the house, and\r\nshe was doomed to sit shivering among her contaminated furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Bart had in fact been treading a devious way, and none of her\r\ncritics could have been more alive to the fact than herself; but\r\nshe had a fatalistic sense of being drawn from one wrong turning\r\nto another, without ever perceiving the right road till it was too\r\nlate to take it.\r\n\r\nLily, who considered herself above narrow prejudices, had not\r\nimagined that the fact of letting Gus Trenor make a little money\r\nfor her would ever disturb her self-complacency. And the fact\r\nin itself still seemed harmless enough; only it was a fertile\r\nsource of harmful complications. As she exhausted the amusement\r\nof spending the money these complications became more pressing,\r\nand Lily, whose mind could be severely logical in tracing the\r\ncauses of her ill-luck to others, justified herself by the thought\r\nthat she owed all her troubles to the enmity of Bertha Dorset.\r\nThis enmity, however, had apparently expired in a renewal of\r\nfriendliness between the two women. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the Dorsets had\r\nresulted, for both, in the discovery that they could be of use to\r\neach other; and the civilized instinct finds a subtler pleasure in\r\nmaking use of its antagonist than in confounding him. Mrs. Dorset\r\nwas, in fact, engaged in a new sentimental experiment, of which\r\nMrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s late property, Ned Silverton, was the rosy victim;\r\nand at such moments, as Judy Trenor had once remarked, she felt a\r\npeculiar need of distracting her husband\xe2\x80\x99s attention. Dorset was\r\nas difficult to amuse as a savage; but even his self-engrossment\r\nwas not proof against Lily\xe2\x80\x99s arts, or rather these were especially\r\nadapted to soothe an uneasy egoism. Her experience with Percy Gryce\r\nstood her in good stead in ministering to Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s humours, and if\r\nthe incentive to please was less urgent, the difficulties of her\r\nsituation were teaching her to make much of minor opportunities.\r\n\r\nIntimacy with the Dorsets was not likely to lessen such\r\ndifficulties on the material side. Mrs. Dorset had none of Judy\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s lavish impulses, and Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s admiration was not likely to\r\nexpress itself in financial \xe2\x80\x9ctips,\xe2\x80\x9d even had Lily cared to renew\r\nher experiences in that line. What she required, for the moment,\r\nof the Dorsets\xe2\x80\x99 friendship, was simply its social sanction. She\r\nknew that people were beginning to talk of her; but this fact did\r\nnot alarm her as it had alarmed Mrs. Peniston. In her set such\r\ngossip was not unusual, and a handsome girl who flirted with a\r\nmarried man was merely assumed to be pressing to the limit of her\r\nopportunities. It was Trenor himself who frightened her. Their walk\r\nin the Park had not been a success. Trenor had married young, and\r\nsince his marriage his intercourse with women had not taken the\r\nform of the sentimental small-talk which doubles upon itself like\r\nthe paths in a maze. He was first puzzled and then irritated to\r\nfind himself always led back to the same starting-point, and Lily\r\nfelt that she was gradually losing control of the situation. Trenor\r\nwas in truth in an unmanageable mood. In spite of his understanding\r\nwith Rosedale he had been somewhat heavily \xe2\x80\x9ctouched\xe2\x80\x9d by the fall in\r\nstocks; his household expenses weighed on him, and he seemed to be\r\nmeeting, on all sides, a sullen opposition to his wishes, instead\r\nof the easy good luck he had hitherto encountered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Trenor was still at Bellomont, keeping the town-house open,\r\nand descending on it now and then for a taste of the world, but\r\npreferring the recurrent excitement of week-end parties to the\r\nrestrictions of a dull season. Since the holidays she had not urged\r\nLily to return to Bellomont, and the first time they met in town\r\nLily fancied there was a shade of coldness in her manner. Was it\r\nmerely the expression of her displeasure at Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s neglect,\r\nor had disquieting rumours reached her? The latter contingency\r\nseemed improbable, yet Lily was not without a sense of uneasiness.\r\nIf her roaming sympathies had struck root anywhere, it was in\r\nher friendship with Judy Trenor. She believed in the sincerity\r\nof her friend\xe2\x80\x99s affection, though it sometimes showed itself in\r\nself-interested ways, and she shrank with peculiar reluctance from\r\nany risk of estranging it. But, aside from this, she was keenly\r\nconscious of the way in which such an estrangement would react on\r\nherself. The fact that Gus Trenor was Judy\xe2\x80\x99s husband was at times\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s strongest reason for disliking him, and for resenting the\r\nobligation under which he had placed her. To set her doubts at\r\nrest, Miss Bart, soon after the New Year, \xe2\x80\x9cproposed\xe2\x80\x9d herself for a\r\nweek-end at Bellomont. She had learned in advance that the presence\r\nof a large party would protect her from too great assiduity on\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s part, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s telegraphic \xe2\x80\x9ccome by all means\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nseemed to assure her of her usual welcome.\r\n\r\nJudy received her amicably. The cares of a large party always\r\nprevailed over personal feelings, and Lily saw no change in\r\nher hostess\xe2\x80\x99s manner. Nevertheless, she was soon aware that\r\nthe experiment of coming to Bellomont was destined not to be\r\nsuccessful. The party was made up of what Mrs. Trenor called \xe2\x80\x9cpoky\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her generic name for persons who did not play bridge\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nit being her habit to group all such obstructionists in one\r\nclass, she usually invited them together, regardless of their\r\nother characteristics. The result was apt to be an irreducible\r\ncombination of persons having no other quality in common than their\r\nabstinence from bridge, and the antagonisms developed in a group\r\nlacking the one taste which might have amalgamated them, were in\r\nthis case aggravated by bad weather, and by the ill-concealed\r\nboredom of their host and hostess. In such emergencies, Judy would\r\nusually have turned to Lily to fuse the discordant elements;\r\nand Miss Bart, assuming that such a service was expected of\r\nher, threw herself into it with her accustomed zeal. But at the\r\noutset she perceived a subtle resistance to her efforts. If Mrs.\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s manner toward her was unchanged, there was certainly a\r\nfaint coldness in that of the other ladies. An occasional caustic\r\nallusion to \xe2\x80\x9cyour friends the Wellington Brys,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cthe little\r\nJew who has bought the Greiner house\xe2\x80\x94some one told us you knew him,\r\nMiss Bart,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94showed Lily that she was in disfavour with that portion\r\nof society which, while contributing least to its amusement, has\r\nassumed the right to decide what forms that amusement shall take.\r\nThe indication was a slight one, and a year ago Lily would have\r\nsmiled at it, trusting to the charm of her personality to dispel\r\nany prejudice against her. But now she had grown more sensitive\r\nto criticism and less confident in her power of disarming it.\r\nShe knew, moreover, that if the ladies at Bellomont permitted\r\nthemselves to criticize her friends openly, it was a proof that\r\nthey were not afraid of subjecting her to the same treatment behind\r\nher back. The nervous dread lest anything in Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s manner should\r\nseem to justify their disapproval made her seek every pretext for\r\navoiding him, and she left Bellomont conscious of having failed in\r\nevery purpose which had taken her there.\r\n\r\nIn town she returned to preoccupations which, for the moment, had\r\nthe happy effect of banishing troublesome thoughts. The Welly Brys,\r\nafter much debate, and anxious counsel with their newly-acquired\r\nfriends, had decided on the bold move of giving a general\r\nentertainment. To attack society collectively, when one\xe2\x80\x99s means of\r\napproach are limited to a few acquaintances, is like advancing into\r\na strange country with an insufficient number of scouts; but such\r\nrash tactics have sometimes led to brilliant victories, and the\r\nBrys had determined to put their fate to the touch. Mrs. Fisher, to\r\nwhom they had entrusted the conduct of the affair, had decided that\r\nTABLEAUX VIVANTS and expensive music were the two baits most likely\r\nto attract the desired prey, and after prolonged negotiations,\r\nand the kind of wire-pulling in which she was known to excel, she\r\nhad induced a dozen fashionable women to exhibit themselves in a\r\nseries of pictures which, by a farther miracle of persuasion, the\r\ndistinguished portrait painter, Paul Morpeth, had been prevailed\r\nupon to organize.\r\n\r\nLily was in her element on such occasions. Under Morpeth\xe2\x80\x99s guidance\r\nher vivid plastic sense, hitherto nurtured on no higher food than\r\ndress-making and upholstery, found eager expression in the disposal\r\nof draperies, the study of attitudes, the shifting of lights\r\nand shadows. Her dramatic instinct was roused by the choice of\r\nsubjects, and the gorgeous reproductions of historic dress stirred\r\nan imagination which only visual impressions could reach. But\r\nkeenest of all was the exhilaration of displaying her own beauty\r\nunder a new aspect: of showing that her loveliness was no mere\r\nfixed quality, but an element shaping all emotions to fresh forms\r\nof grace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s measures had been well-taken, and society, surprised\r\nin a dull moment, succumbed to the temptation of Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhospitality. The protesting minority were forgotten in the throng\r\nwhich abjured and came; and the audience was almost as brilliant as\r\nthe show.\r\n\r\nLawrence Selden was among those who had yielded to the proffered\r\ninducements. If he did not often act on the accepted social axiom\r\nthat a man may go where he pleases, it was because he had long\r\nsince learned that his pleasures were mainly to be found in a small\r\ngroup of the like-minded. But he enjoyed spectacular effects, and\r\nwas not insensible to the part money plays in their production: all\r\nhe asked was that the very rich should live up to their calling\r\nas stage-managers, and not spend their money in a dull way. This\r\nthe Brys could certainly not be charged with doing. Their recently\r\nbuilt house, whatever it might lack as a frame for domesticity,\r\nwas almost as well-designed for the display of a festal assemblage\r\nas one of those airy pleasure-halls which the Italian architects\r\nimprovised to set off the hospitality of princes. The air of\r\nimprovisation was in fact strikingly present: so recent, so\r\nrapidly-evoked was the whole MISE-EN-SCENE that one had to touch\r\nthe marble columns to learn they were not of cardboard, to seat\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self in one of the damask-and-gold arm-chairs to be sure it\r\nwas not painted against the wall.\r\n\r\nSelden, who had put one of these seats to the test, found himself,\r\nfrom an angle of the ball-room, surveying the scene with frank\r\nenjoyment. The company, in obedience to the decorative instinct\r\nwhich calls for fine clothes in fine surroundings, had dressed\r\nrather with an eye to Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s background than to herself. The\r\nseated throng, filling the immense room without undue crowding,\r\npresented a surface of rich tissues and jewelled shoulders in\r\nharmony with the festooned and gilded walls, and the flushed\r\nsplendours of the Venetian ceiling. At the farther end of the room\r\na stage had been constructed behind a proscenium arch curtained\r\nwith folds of old damask; but in the pause before the parting of\r\nthe folds there was little thought of what they might reveal, for\r\nevery woman who had accepted Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s invitation was engaged in\r\ntrying to find out how many of her friends had done the same.\r\n\r\nGerty Farish, seated next to Selden, was lost in that\r\nindiscriminate and uncritical enjoyment so irritating to Miss\r\nBart\xe2\x80\x99s finer perceptions. It may be that Selden\xe2\x80\x99s nearness had\r\nsomething to do with the quality of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure; but Miss\r\nFarish was so little accustomed to refer her enjoyment of such\r\nscenes to her own share in them, that she was merely conscious of a\r\ndeeper sense of contentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it dear of Lily to get me an invitation? Of course it would\r\nnever have occurred to Carry Fisher to put me on the list, and I\r\nshould have been so sorry to miss seeing it all\xe2\x80\x94and especially\r\nLily herself. Some one told me the ceiling was by Veronese\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwould know, of course, Lawrence. I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s very beautiful,\r\nbut his women are so dreadfully fat. Goddesses? Well, I can only\r\nsay that if they\xe2\x80\x99d been mortals and had to wear corsets, it would\r\nhave been better for them. I think our women are much handsomer.\r\nAnd this room is wonderfully becoming\xe2\x80\x94every one looks so well! Did\r\nyou ever see such jewels? Do look at Mrs. George Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s pearls\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nsuppose the smallest of them would pay the rent of our Girls\xe2\x80\x99 Club\r\nfor a year. Not that I ought to complain about the club; every\r\none has been so wonderfully kind. Did I tell you that Lily had\r\ngiven us three hundred dollars? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it splendid of her? And\r\nthen she collected a lot of money from her friends\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Bry gave\r\nus five hundred, and Mr. Rosedale a thousand. I wish Lily were not\r\nso nice to Mr. Rosedale, but she says it\xe2\x80\x99s no use being rude to\r\nhim, because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see the difference. She really can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nto hurt people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\xe2\x80\x94it makes me so angry when I hear her\r\ncalled cold and conceited! The girls at the club don\xe2\x80\x99t call her\r\nthat. Do you know she has been there with me twice?\xe2\x80\x94yes, Lily! And\r\nyou should have seen their eyes! One of them said it was as good\r\nas a day in the country just to look at her. And she sat there,\r\nand laughed and talked with them\xe2\x80\x94not a bit as if she were being\r\nCHARITABLE, you know, but as if she liked it as much as they did.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking ever since when she\xe2\x80\x99s coming back; and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromised me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s confidences were cut short by the parting of the\r\ncurtain on the first TABLEAU\xe2\x80\x94a group of nymphs dancing across\r\nflower-strewn sward in the rhythmic postures of Botticelli\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSpring. TABLEAUX VIVANTS depend for their effect not only on the\r\nhappy disposal of lights and the delusive interposition of layers\r\nof gauze, but on a corresponding adjustment of the mental vision.\r\nTo unfurnished minds they remain, in spite of every enhancement\r\nof art, only a superior kind of wax-works; but to the responsive\r\nfancy they may give magic glimpses of the boundary world between\r\nfact and imagination. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s mind was of this order: he could\r\nyield to vision-making influences as completely as a child to the\r\nspell of a fairy-tale. Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s TABLEAUX wanted none of the\r\nqualities which go to the producing of such illusions, and under\r\nMorpeth\xe2\x80\x99s organizing hand the pictures succeeded each other with\r\nthe rhythmic march of some splendid frieze, in which the fugitive\r\ncurves of living flesh and the wandering light of young eyes have\r\nbeen subdued to plastic harmony without losing the charm of life.\r\n\r\nThe scenes were taken from old pictures, and the participators had\r\nbeen cleverly fitted with characters suited to their types. No\r\none, for instance, could have made a more typical Goya than Carry\r\nFisher, with her short dark-skinned face, the exaggerated glow of\r\nher eyes, the provocation of her frankly-painted smile. A brilliant\r\nMiss Smedden from Brooklyn showed to perfection the sumptuous\r\ncurves of Titian\xe2\x80\x99s Daughter, lifting her gold salver laden with\r\ngrapes above the harmonizing gold of rippled hair and rich brocade,\r\nand a young Mrs. Van Alstyne, who showed the frailer Dutch type,\r\nwith high blue-veined forehead and pale eyes and lashes, made\r\na characteristic Vandyck, in black satin, against a curtained\r\narchway. Then there were Kauffmann nymphs garlanding the altar of\r\nLove; a Veronese supper, all sheeny textures, pearl-woven heads and\r\nmarble architecture; and a Watteau group of lute-playing comedians,\r\nlounging by a fountain in a sunlit glade.\r\n\r\nEach evanescent picture touched the vision-building faculty in\r\nSelden, leading him so far down the vistas of fancy that even Gerty\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s running commentary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how lovely Lulu Melson looks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor: \xe2\x80\x9cThat must be Kate Corby, to the right there, in purple\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94did\r\nnot break the spell of the illusion. Indeed, so skilfully had the\r\npersonality of the actors been subdued to the scenes they figured\r\nin that even the least imaginative of the audience must have felt\r\na thrill of contrast when the curtain suddenly parted on a picture\r\nwhich was simply and undisguisedly the portrait of Miss Bart.\r\n\r\nHere there could be no mistaking the predominance of\r\npersonality\xe2\x80\x94the unanimous \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d of the spectators was a tribute,\r\nnot to the brush-work of Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Lloyd\xe2\x80\x9d but to the flesh\r\nand blood loveliness of Lily Bart. She had shown her artistic\r\nintelligence in selecting a type so like her own that she could\r\nembody the person represented without ceasing to be herself. It\r\nwas as though she had stepped, not out of, but into, Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncanvas, banishing the phantom of his dead beauty by the beams\r\nof her living grace. The impulse to show herself in a splendid\r\nsetting\xe2\x80\x94she had thought for a moment of representing Tiepolo\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCleopatra\xe2\x80\x94had yielded to the truer instinct of trusting to her\r\nunassisted beauty, and she had purposely chosen a picture without\r\ndistracting accessories of dress or surroundings. Her pale\r\ndraperies, and the background of foliage against which she stood,\r\nserved only to relieve the long dryad-like curves that swept upward\r\nfrom her poised foot to her lifted arm. The noble buoyancy of her\r\nattitude, its suggestion of soaring grace, revealed the touch of\r\npoetry in her beauty that Selden always felt in her presence, yet\r\nlost the sense of when he was not with her. Its expression was now\r\nso vivid that for the first time he seemed to see before him the\r\nreal Lily Bart, divested of the trivialities of her little world,\r\nand catching for a moment a note of that eternal harmony of which\r\nher beauty was a part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeuced bold thing to show herself in that get-up; but, gad, there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a break in the lines anywhere, and I suppose she wanted us to\r\nknow it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words, uttered by that experienced connoisseur, Mr. Ned\r\nVan Alstyne, whose scented white moustache had brushed Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder whenever the parting of the curtains presented any\r\nexceptional opportunity for the study of the female outline,\r\naffected their hearer in an unexpected way. It was not the first\r\ntime that Selden had heard Lily\xe2\x80\x99s beauty lightly remarked on, and\r\nhitherto the tone of the comments had imperceptibly coloured his\r\nview of her. But now it woke only a motion of indignant contempt.\r\nThis was the world she lived in, these were the standards by which\r\nshe was fated to be measured! Does one go to Caliban for a judgment\r\non Miranda?\r\n\r\nIn the long moment before the curtain fell, he had time to feel\r\nthe whole tragedy of her life. It was as though her beauty, thus\r\ndetached from all that cheapened and vulgarized it, had held out\r\nsuppliant hands to him from the world in which he and she had once\r\nmet for a moment, and where he felt an overmastering longing to be\r\nwith her again.\r\n\r\nHe was roused by the pressure of ecstatic fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t she too\r\nbeautiful, Lawrence? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you like her best in that simple dress?\r\nIt makes her look like the real Lily\xe2\x80\x94the Lily I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s brimming gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lily we know,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncorrected; and his cousin, beaming at the implied understanding,\r\nexclaimed joyfully: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her that! She always says you\r\ndislike her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe performance over, Selden\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse was to seek\r\nMiss Bart. During the interlude of music which succeeded the\r\nTABLEAUX, the actors had seated themselves here and there in the\r\naudience, diversifying its conventional appearance by the varied\r\npicturesqueness of their dress. Lily, however, was not among them,\r\nand her absence served to protract the effect she had produced\r\non Selden: it would have broken the spell to see her too soon in\r\nthe surroundings from which accident had so happily detached her.\r\nThey had not met since the day of the Van Osburgh wedding, and on\r\nhis side the avoidance had been intentional. Tonight, however,\r\nhe knew that, sooner or later, he should find himself at her\r\nside; and though he let the dispersing crowd drift him whither\r\nit would, without making an immediate effort to reach her, his\r\nprocrastination was not due to any lingering resistance, but to the\r\ndesire to luxuriate a moment in the sense of complete surrender.\r\n\r\nLily had not an instant\xe2\x80\x99s doubt as to the meaning of the murmur\r\ngreeting her appearance. No other tableau had been received with\r\nthat precise note of approval: it had obviously been called forth\r\nby herself, and not by the picture she impersonated. She had feared\r\nat the last moment that she was risking too much in dispensing with\r\nthe advantages of a more sumptuous setting, and the completeness\r\nof her triumph gave her an intoxicating sense of recovered power.\r\nNot caring to diminish the impression she had produced, she held\r\nherself aloof from the audience till the movement of dispersal\r\nbefore supper, and thus had a second opportunity of showing\r\nherself to advantage, as the throng poured slowly into the empty\r\ndrawing-room where she was standing.\r\n\r\nShe was soon the centre of a group which increased and renewed\r\nitself as the circulation became general, and the individual\r\ncomments on her success were a delightful prolongation of the\r\ncollective applause. At such moments she lost something of\r\nher natural fastidiousness, and cared less for the quality of\r\nthe admiration received than for its quantity. Differences of\r\npersonality were merged in a warm atmosphere of praise, in which\r\nher beauty expanded like a flower in sunlight; and if Selden had\r\napproached a moment or two sooner he would have seen her turning\r\non Ned Van Alstyne and George Dorset the look he had dreamed of\r\ncapturing for himself.\r\n\r\nFortune willed, however, that the hurried approach of Mrs. Fisher,\r\nas whose aide-de-camp Van Alstyne was acting, should break up the\r\ngroup before Selden reached the threshold of the room. One or two\r\nof the men wandered off in search of their partners for supper,\r\nand the others, noticing Selden\xe2\x80\x99s approach, gave way to him in\r\naccordance with the tacit freemasonry of the ball-room. Lily was\r\ntherefore standing alone when he reached her; and finding the\r\nexpected look in her eye, he had the satisfaction of supposing he\r\nhad kindled it. The look did indeed deepen as it rested on him, for\r\neven in that moment of self-intoxication Lily felt the quicker beat\r\nof life that his nearness always produced. She read, too, in his\r\nanswering gaze the delicious confirmation of her triumph, and for\r\nthe moment it seemed to her that it was for him only she cared to\r\nbe beautiful.\r\n\r\nSelden had given her his arm without speaking. She took it in\r\nsilence, and they moved away, not toward the supper-room, but\r\nagainst the tide which was setting thither. The faces about her\r\nflowed by like the streaming images of sleep: she hardly noticed\r\nwhere Selden was leading her, till they passed through a glass\r\ndoorway at the end of the long suite of rooms and stood suddenly in\r\nthe fragrant hush of a garden. Gravel grated beneath their feet,\r\nand about them was the transparent dimness of a midsummer night.\r\nHanging lights made emerald caverns in the depths of foliage, and\r\nwhitened the spray of a fountain falling among lilies. The magic\r\nplace was deserted: there was no sound but the splash of the water\r\non the lily-pads, and a distant drift of music that might have been\r\nblown across a sleeping lake.\r\n\r\nSelden and Lily stood still, accepting the unreality of the scene\r\nas a part of their own dream-like sensations. It would not have\r\nsurprised them to feel a summer breeze on their faces, or to see\r\nthe lights among the boughs reduplicated in the arch of a starry\r\nsky. The strange solitude about them was no stranger than the\r\nsweetness of being alone in it together. At length Lily withdrew\r\nher hand, and moved away a step, so that her white-robed slimness\r\nwas outlined against the dusk of the branches. Selden followed her,\r\nand still without speaking they seated themselves on a bench beside\r\nthe fountain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she raised her eyes with the beseeching earnestness of a\r\nchild. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never speak to me\xe2\x80\x94you think hard things of me,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think of you at any rate, God knows!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do we never see each other? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we be friends?\r\nYou promised once to help me,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued in the same tone, as\r\nthough the words were drawn from her unwillingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way I can help you is by loving you,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden said in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, but her face turned to him with the soft motion\r\nof a flower. His own met it slowly, and their lips touched. She\r\ndrew back and rose from her seat. Selden rose too, and they stood\r\nfacing each other. Suddenly she caught his hand and pressed it a\r\nmoment against her cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, love me, love me\xe2\x80\x94but don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me so!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed with her\r\neyes in his; and before he could speak she had turned and slipped\r\nthrough the arch of boughs, disappearing in the brightness of the\r\nroom beyond.\r\n\r\nSelden stood where she had left him. He knew too well the\r\ntransiency of exquisite moments to attempt to follow her; but\r\npresently he reentered the house and made his way through the\r\ndeserted rooms to the door. A few sumptuously-cloaked ladies were\r\nalready gathered in the marble vestibule, and in the coat-room he\r\nfound Van Alstyne and Gus Trenor.\r\n\r\nThe former, at Selden\xe2\x80\x99s approach, paused in the careful selection\r\nof a cigar from one of the silver boxes invitingly set out near the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Selden, going too? You\xe2\x80\x99re an Epicurean like myself, I see:\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see all those goddesses gobbling terrapin. Gad,\r\nwhat a show of good-looking women; but not one of \xe2\x80\x99em could touch\r\nthat little cousin of mine. Talk of jewels\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s a woman want with\r\njewels when she\xe2\x80\x99s got herself to show? The trouble is that all\r\nthese fal-bals they wear cover up their figures when they\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not her fault if everybody don\xe2\x80\x99t know it now,\xe2\x80\x9d growled\r\nTrenor, flushed with the struggle of getting into his fur-lined\r\ncoat. \xe2\x80\x9cDamned bad taste, I call it\xe2\x80\x94no, no cigar for me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell what you\xe2\x80\x99re smoking in one of these new houses\xe2\x80\x94likely as not\r\nthe CHEF buys the cigars. Stay for supper? Not if I know it! When\r\npeople crowd their rooms so that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get near any one you\r\nwant to speak to, I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon sup in the elevated at the rush hour.\r\nMy wife was dead right to stay away: she says life\xe2\x80\x99s too short to\r\nspend it in breaking in new people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n\r\nLily woke from happy dreams to find two notes at her bed-side.\r\n\r\nOne was from Mrs. Trenor, who announced that she was coming to town\r\nthat afternoon for a flying visit, and hoped Miss Bart would be\r\nable to dine with her. The other was from Selden. He wrote briefly\r\nthat an important case called him to Albany, whence he would be\r\nunable to return till the evening, and asked Lily to let him know\r\nat what hour on the following day she would see him.\r\n\r\nLily, leaning back among her pillows, gazed musingly at his\r\nletter. The scene in the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 conservatory had been like a part\r\nof her dreams; she had not expected to wake to such evidence\r\nof its reality. Her first movement was one of annoyance: this\r\nunforeseen act of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s added another complication to life. It\r\nwas so unlike him to yield to such an irrational impulse! Did he\r\nreally mean to ask her to marry him? She had once shown him the\r\nimpossibility of such a hope, and his subsequent behaviour seemed\r\nto prove that he had accepted the situation with a reasonableness\r\nsomewhat mortifying to her vanity. It was all the more agreeable\r\nto find that this reasonableness was maintained only at the cost\r\nof not seeing her; but, though nothing in life was as sweet as the\r\nsense of her power over him, she saw the danger of allowing the\r\nepisode of the previous night to have a sequel. Since she could\r\nnot marry him, it would be kinder to him, as well as easier for\r\nherself, to write a line amicably evading his request to see her:\r\nhe was not the man to mistake such a hint, and when next they met\r\nit would be on their usual friendly footing.\r\n\r\nLily sprang out of bed, and went straight to her desk. She wanted\r\nto write at once, while she could trust to the strength of her\r\nresolve. She was still languid from her brief sleep and the\r\nexhilaration of the evening, and the sight of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s writing\r\nbrought back the culminating moment of her triumph: the moment\r\nwhen she had read in his eyes that no philosophy was proof against\r\nher power. It would be pleasant to have that sensation again . . .\r\nno one else could give it to her in its fulness; and she could\r\nnot bear to mar her mood of luxurious retrospection by an act of\r\ndefinite refusal. She took up her pen and wrote hastily: \xe2\x80\x9cTOMORROW\r\nAT FOUR;\xe2\x80\x9d murmuring to herself, as she slipped the sheet into its\r\nenvelope: \xe2\x80\x9cI can easily put him off when tomorrow comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJudy Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s summons was very welcome to Lily. It was the first\r\ntime she had received a direct communication from Bellomont\r\nsince the close of her last visit there, and she was still\r\nvisited by the dread of having incurred Judy\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure.\r\nBut this characteristic command seemed to reestablish their\r\nformer relations; and Lily smiled at the thought that her friend\r\nhad probably summoned her in order to hear about the Brys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nentertainment. Mrs. Trenor had absented herself from the feast,\r\nperhaps for the reason so frankly enunciated by her husband,\r\nperhaps because, as Mrs. Fisher somewhat differently put it, she\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear new people when she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t discovered them herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAt any rate, though she remained haughtily at Bellomont, Lily\r\nsuspected in her a devouring eagerness to hear of what she had\r\nmissed, and to learn exactly in what measure Mrs. Wellington Bry\r\nhad surpassed all previous competitors for social recognition. Lily\r\nwas quite ready to gratify this curiosity, but it happened that she\r\nwas dining out. She determined, however, to see Mrs. Trenor for a\r\nfew moments, and ringing for her maid she despatched a telegram to\r\nsay that she would be with her friend that evening at ten.\r\n\r\nShe was dining with Mrs. Fisher, who had gathered at an informal\r\nfeast a few of the performers of the previous evening. There was\r\nto be plantation music in the studio after dinner\xe2\x80\x94for Mrs. Fisher,\r\ndespairing of the republic, had taken up modelling, and annexed to\r\nher small crowded house a spacious apartment, which, whatever its\r\nuses in her hours of plastic inspiration, served at other times for\r\nthe exercise of an indefatigable hospitality. Lily was reluctant\r\nto leave, for the dinner was amusing, and she would have liked to\r\nlounge over a cigarette and hear a few songs; but she could not\r\nbreak her engagement with Judy, and shortly after ten she asked\r\nher hostess to ring for a hansom, and drove up Fifth Avenue to the\r\nTrenors\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nShe waited long enough on the doorstep to wonder that Judy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence in town was not signalized by a greater promptness in\r\nadmitting her; and her surprise was increased when, instead of\r\nthe expected footman, pushing his shoulders into a tardy coat,\r\na shabby care-taking person in calico let her into the shrouded\r\nhall. Trenor, however, appeared at once on the threshold of the\r\ndrawing-room, welcoming her with unusual volubility while he\r\nrelieved her of her cloak and drew her into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along to the den; it\xe2\x80\x99s the only comfortable place in the\r\nhouse. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this room look as if it was waiting for the body\r\nto be brought down? Can\xe2\x80\x99t see why Judy keeps the house wrapped up\r\nin this awful slippery white stuff\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to give a fellow\r\npneumonia to walk through these rooms on a cold day. You look a\r\nlittle pinched yourself, by the way: it\xe2\x80\x99s rather a sharp night\r\nout. I noticed it walking up from the club. Come along, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngive you a nip of brandy, and you can toast yourself over the fire\r\nand try some of my new Egyptians\xe2\x80\x94that little Turkish chap at the\r\nEmbassy put me on to a brand that I want you to try, and if you\r\nlike \xe2\x80\x99em I\xe2\x80\x99ll get out a lot for you: they don\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x99em here yet,\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99ll cable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led her through the house to the large room at the back, where\r\nMrs. Trenor usually sat, and where, even in her absence, there was\r\nan air of occupancy. Here, as usual, were flowers, newspapers,\r\na littered writing-table, and a general aspect of lamp-lit\r\nfamiliarity, so that it was a surprise not to see Judy\xe2\x80\x99s energetic\r\nfigure start up from the arm-chair near the fire.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently Trenor himself who had been occupying the seat\r\nin question, for it was overhung by a cloud of cigar smoke, and\r\nnear it stood one of those intricate folding tables which British\r\ningenuity has devised to facilitate the circulation of tobacco and\r\nspirits. The sight of such appliances in a drawing-room was not\r\nunusual in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s set, where smoking and drinking were unrestricted\r\nby considerations of time and place, and her first movement was\r\nto help herself to one of the cigarettes recommended by Trenor,\r\nwhile she checked his loquacity by asking, with a surprised glance:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Judy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor, a little heated by his unusual flow of words, and perhaps\r\nby prolonged propinquity with the decanters, was bending over the\r\nlatter to decipher their silver labels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, now, Lily, just a drop of cognac in a little fizzy water\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ndo look pinched, you know: I swear the end of your nose is red.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take another glass to keep you company\xe2\x80\x94Judy?\xe2\x80\x94Why, you see,\r\nJudy\xe2\x80\x99s got a devil of a head ache\xe2\x80\x94quite knocked out with it, poor\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94she asked me to explain\xe2\x80\x94make it all right, you know\xe2\x80\x94Do come\r\nup to the fire, though; you look dead-beat, really. Now do let me\r\nmake you comfortable, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had taken her hand, half-banteringly, and was drawing her toward\r\na low seat by the hearth; but she stopped and freed herself quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that Judy\xe2\x80\x99s not well enough to see me? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe want me to go upstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor drained the glass he had filled for himself, and paused to\r\nset it down before he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, no\xe2\x80\x94the fact is, she\xe2\x80\x99s not up to seeing anybody. It came on\r\nsuddenly, you know, and she asked me to tell you how awfully sorry\r\nshe was\xe2\x80\x94if she\xe2\x80\x99d known where you were dining she\xe2\x80\x99d have sent you\r\nword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did know where I was dining; I mentioned it in my telegram.\r\nBut it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, of course. I suppose if she\xe2\x80\x99s so poorly she\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go back to Bellomont in the morning, and I can come and see\r\nher then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: exactly\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s capital. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell her you\xe2\x80\x99ll pop in tomorrow\r\nmorning. And now do sit down a minute, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear, and let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhave a nice quiet jaw together. You won\xe2\x80\x99t take a drop, just for\r\nsociability? Tell me what you think of that cigarette. Why, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou like it? What are you chucking it away for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am chucking it away because I must go, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the\r\ngoodness to call a cab for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily returned with a smile.\r\n\r\nShe did not like Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s unusual excitability, with its too\r\nevident explanation, and the thought of being alone with him,\r\nwith her friend out of reach upstairs, at the other end of the\r\ngreat empty house, did not conduce to a desire to prolong their\r\nTETE-A-TETE.\r\n\r\nBut Trenor, with a promptness which did not escape her, had moved\r\nbetween herself and the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must you go, I should like to know? If Judy\xe2\x80\x99d been here you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave sat gossiping till all hours\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t even give me five\r\nminutes! It\xe2\x80\x99s always the same story. Last night I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get near\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I went to that damned vulgar party just to see you, and there\r\nwas everybody talking about you, and asking me if I\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen\r\nanything so stunning, and when I tried to come up and say a word,\r\nyou never took any notice, but just went on laughing and joking\r\nwith a lot of asses who only wanted to be able to swagger about\r\nafterward, and look knowing when you were mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, flushed by his diatribe, and fixing on her a look in\r\nwhich resentment was the ingredient she least disliked. But she\r\nhad regained her presence of mind, and stood composedly in the\r\nmiddle of the room, while her slight smile seemed to put an ever\r\nincreasing distance between herself and Trenor.\r\n\r\nAcross it she said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd, Gus. It\xe2\x80\x99s past eleven, and I\r\nmust really ask you to ring for a cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe remained immovable, with the lowering forehead she had grown to\r\ndetest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing I won\xe2\x80\x99t ring for one\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99ll you do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go upstairs to Judy if you force me to disturb her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor drew a step nearer and laid his hand on her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\nLily: won\xe2\x80\x99t you give me five minutes of your own accord?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot tonight, Gus: you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, then: I\xe2\x80\x99ll take \xe2\x80\x99em. And as many more as I want.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhad squared himself on the threshold, his hands thrust deep in his\r\npockets. He nodded toward the chair on the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and sit down there, please: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a word to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s quick temper was getting the better of her fears. She drew\r\nherself up and moved toward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have anything to say to me, you must say it another time. I\r\nshall go up to Judy unless you call a cab for me at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe burst into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cGo upstairs and welcome, my dear; but you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t find Judy. She ain\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily cast a startled look upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that Judy is not\r\nin the house\xe2\x80\x94not in town?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I do mean,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Trenor, his bluster sinking\r\nto sullenness under her look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you. I am going upstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nHe drew unexpectedly aside, letting her reach the threshold\r\nunimpeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo up and welcome; but my wife is at Bellomont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Lily had a flash of reassurance. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come she would\r\nhave sent me word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did; she telephoned me this afternoon to let you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI received no message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t send any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two measured each other for a moment, but Lily still saw her\r\nopponent through a blur of scorn that made all other considerations\r\nindistinct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine your object in playing such a stupid trick on me;\r\nbut if you have fully gratified your peculiar sense of humour I\r\nmust again ask you to send for a cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the wrong note, and she knew it as she spoke. To be stung by\r\nirony it is not necessary to understand it, and the angry streaks\r\non Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s face might have been raised by an actual lash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Lily, don\xe2\x80\x99t take that high and mighty tone with me.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhad again moved toward the door, and in her instinctive shrinking\r\nfrom him she let him regain command of the threshold. \xe2\x80\x9cI DID play a\r\ntrick on you; I own up to it; but if you think I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmistaken. Lord knows I\xe2\x80\x99ve been patient enough\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve hung round and\r\nlooked like an ass. And all the while you were letting a lot of\r\nother fellows make up to you . . . letting \xe2\x80\x99em make fun of me,\r\nI daresay . . . I\xe2\x80\x99m not sharp, and can\xe2\x80\x99t dress my friends up to\r\nlook funny, as you do . . . but I can tell when it\xe2\x80\x99s being done to\r\nme.... I can tell fast enough when I\xe2\x80\x99m made a fool of....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought that!\xe2\x80\x9d flashed from Lily; but her\r\nlaugh dropped to silence under his look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought it; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll know better now.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re here for tonight. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for a quiet\r\ntime to talk things over, and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it I mean to make you\r\nhear me out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis first rush of inarticulate resentment had been followed by a\r\nsteadiness and concentration of tone more disconcerting to Lily\r\nthan the excitement preceding it. For a moment her presence of mind\r\nforsook her. She had more than once been in situations where a\r\nquick sword-play of wit had been needful to cover her retreat; but\r\nher frightened heart-throbs told her that here such skill would not\r\navail.\r\n\r\nTo gain time she repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor had pushed a chair between herself and the door. He threw\r\nhimself in it, and leaned back, looking up at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I want: I want to know just where you and\r\nI stand. Hang it, the man who pays for the dinner is generally\r\nallowed to have a seat at table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flamed with anger and abasement, and the sickening need of\r\nhaving to conciliate where she longed to humble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean\xe2\x80\x94but you must see, Gus, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstay here talking to you at this hour\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad, you go to men\xe2\x80\x99s houses fast enough in broad day light\xe2\x80\x94strikes\r\nme you\xe2\x80\x99re not always so deuced careful of appearances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brutality of the thrust gave her the sense of dizziness that\r\nfollows on a physical blow. Rosedale had spoken then\xe2\x80\x94this was the\r\nway men talked of her\xe2\x80\x94She felt suddenly weak and defenceless: there\r\nwas a throb of self-pity in her throat. But all the while another\r\nself was sharpening her to vigilance, whispering the terrified\r\nwarning that every word and gesture must be measured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have brought me here to say insulting things\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\nTrenor laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk stage-rot. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to insult you.\r\nBut a man\xe2\x80\x99s got his feelings\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ve played with mine too long.\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t begin this business\xe2\x80\x94kept out of the way, and left the\r\ntrack clear for the other chaps, till you rummaged me out and set\r\nto work to make an ass of me\xe2\x80\x94and an easy job you had of it, too.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble\xe2\x80\x94it was too easy for you\xe2\x80\x94you got reckless\xe2\x80\x94thought\r\nyou could turn me inside out, and chuck me in the gutter like an\r\nempty purse. But, by gad, that ain\xe2\x80\x99t playing fair: that\xe2\x80\x99s dodging\r\nthe rules of the game. Of course I know now what you wanted\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t my beautiful eyes you were after\xe2\x80\x94but I tell you what, Miss\r\nLily, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to pay up for making me think so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, squaring his shoulders aggressively, and stepped toward\r\nher with a reddening brow; but she held her footing, though every\r\nnerve tore at her to retreat as he advanced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay up?\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that I owe you money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for payment in kind. But\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as fair play\xe2\x80\x94and interest on one\xe2\x80\x99s money\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhang me if I\xe2\x80\x99ve had as much as a look from you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour money? What have I to do with your money? You advised me\r\nhow to invest mine . . . you must have seen I knew nothing of\r\nbusiness . . . you told me it was all right\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt WAS all right\xe2\x80\x94it is, Lily: you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to all of it, and ten\r\ntimes more. I\xe2\x80\x99m only asking for a word of thanks from you.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\ncloser still, with a hand that grew formidable; and the frightened\r\nself in her was dragging the other down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI HAVE thanked you; I\xe2\x80\x99ve shown I was grateful. What more have you\r\ndone than any friend might do, or any one accept from a friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor caught her up with a sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt you\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted\r\nas much before\xe2\x80\x94and chucked the other chaps as you\xe2\x80\x99d like to chuck\r\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care how you settled your score with them\xe2\x80\x94if you fooled\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em I\xe2\x80\x99m that much to the good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stare at me like that\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not talking the way a man is supposed to talk to a girl\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\nhang it, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it you can stop me quick enough\xe2\x80\x94you know\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m mad about you\xe2\x80\x94damn the money, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty more of it\xe2\x80\x94if THAT\r\nbothers you.... I was a brute, Lily\xe2\x80\x94Lily!\xe2\x80\x94just look at me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOver and over her the sea of humiliation broke\xe2\x80\x94wave crashing on\r\nwave so close that the moral shame was one with the physical\r\ndread. It seemed to her that self-esteem would have made her\r\ninvulnerable\xe2\x80\x94that it was her own dishonour which put a fearful\r\nsolitude about her.\r\n\r\nHis touch was a shock to her drowning consciousness. She drew back\r\nfrom him with a desperate assumption of scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told you I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x94but if I owe you money you shall\r\nbe paid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened to rage: her recoil of abhorrence had called\r\nout the primitive man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll borrow from Selden or Rosedale\xe2\x80\x94and take your chances of\r\nfooling them as you\xe2\x80\x99ve fooled me! Unless\xe2\x80\x94unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve settled your\r\nother scores already\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one left out in the cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood silent, frozen to her place. The words\xe2\x80\x94the words were\r\nworse than the touch! Her heart was beating all over her body\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nher throat, her limbs, her helpless useless hands. Her eyes\r\ntravelled despairingly about the room\xe2\x80\x94they lit on the bell, and\r\nshe remembered that help was in call. Yes, but scandal with it\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nhideous mustering of tongues. No, she must fight her way out alone.\r\nIt was enough that the servants knew her to be in the house with\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x94there must be nothing to excite conjecture in her way of\r\nleaving it.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head, and achieved a last clear look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here alone with you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat more have you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo her surprise, Trenor answered the look with a speechless stare.\r\nWith his last gust of words the flame had died out, leaving him\r\nchill and humbled. It was as though a cold air had dispersed the\r\nfumes of his libations, and the situation loomed before him black\r\nand naked as the ruins of a fire. Old habits, old restraints, the\r\nhand of inherited order, plucked back the bewildered mind which\r\npassion had jolted from its ruts. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s eye had the haggard look\r\nof the sleep-walker waked on a deathly ledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo home! Go away from here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94he stammered, and turning his back on\r\nher walked toward the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe sharp release from her fears restored Lily to immediate\r\nlucidity. The collapse of Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s will left her in control, and\r\nshe heard herself, in a voice that was her own yet outside herself,\r\nbidding him ring for the servant, bidding him give the order for\r\na hansom, directing him to put her in it when it came. Whence the\r\nstrength came to her she knew not; but an insistent voice warned\r\nher that she must leave the house openly, and nerved her, in the\r\nhall before the hovering care taker, to exchange light words with\r\nTrenor, and charge him with the usual messages for Judy, while all\r\nthe while she shook with inward loathing. On the doorstep, with the\r\nstreet before her, she felt a mad throb of liberation, intoxicating\r\nas the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s first draught of free air; but the clearness of\r\nbrain continued, and she noted the mute aspect of Fifth Avenue,\r\nguessed at the lateness of the hour, and even observed a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfigure\xe2\x80\x94was there something half-familiar in its outline?\xe2\x80\x94which,\r\nas she entered the hansom, turned from the opposite corner and\r\nvanished in the obscurity of the side street.\r\n\r\nBut with the turn of the wheels reaction came, and shuddering\r\ndarkness closed on her. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned,\r\nand leaned her head against the rattling side of the cab. She\r\nseemed a stranger to herself, or rather there were two selves\r\nin her, the one she had always known, and a new abhorrent being\r\nto which it found itself chained. She had once picked up, in a\r\nhouse where she was staying, a translation of the EUMENIDES, and\r\nher imagination had been seized by the high terror of the scene\r\nwhere Orestes, in the cave of the oracle, finds his implacable\r\nhuntresses asleep, and snatches an hour\xe2\x80\x99s repose. Yes, the Furies\r\nmight sometimes sleep, but they were there, always there in the\r\ndark corners, and now they were awake and the iron clang of their\r\nwings was in her brain.... She opened her eyes and saw the streets\r\npassing\xe2\x80\x94the familiar alien streets. All she looked on was the\r\nsame and yet changed. There was a great gulf fixed between today\r\nand yesterday. Everything in the past seemed simple, natural,\r\nfull of daylight\xe2\x80\x94and she was alone in a place of darkness and\r\npollution.\xe2\x80\x94Alone! It was the loneliness that frightened her. Her\r\neyes fell on an illuminated clock at a street corner, and she saw\r\nthat the hands marked the half hour after eleven. Only half-past\r\neleven\xe2\x80\x94there were hours and hours left of the night! And she\r\nmust spend them alone, shuddering sleepless on her bed. Her soft\r\nnature recoiled from this ordeal, which had none of the stimulus\r\nof conflict to goad her through it. Oh, the slow cold drip of the\r\nminutes on her head! She had a vision of herself lying on the\r\nblack walnut bed\xe2\x80\x94and the darkness would frighten her, and if she\r\nleft the light burning the dreary details of the room would brand\r\nthemselves forever on her brain. She had always hated her room at\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94its ugliness, its impersonality, the fact that\r\nnothing in it was really hers. To a torn heart uncomforted by\r\nhuman nearness a room may open almost human arms, and the being to\r\nwhom no four walls mean more than any others, is, at such hours,\r\nexpatriate everywhere.\r\n\r\nLily had no heart to lean on. Her relation with her aunt was as\r\nsuperficial as that of chance lodgers who pass on the stairs. But\r\neven had the two been in closer contact, it was impossible to think\r\nof Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s mind as offering shelter or comprehension to\r\nsuch misery as Lily\xe2\x80\x99s. As the pain that can be told is but half a\r\npain, so the pity that questions has little healing in its touch.\r\nWhat Lily craved was the darkness made by enfolding arms, the\r\nsilence which is not solitude, but compassion holding its breath.\r\n\r\nShe started up and looked forth on the passing streets. Gerty!\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nwere nearing Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s corner. If only she could reach there before\r\nthis labouring anguish burst from her breast to her lips\xe2\x80\x94if only\r\nshe could feel the hold of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s arms while she shook in the\r\nague-fit of fear that was coming upon her! She pushed up the door\r\nin the roof and called the address to the driver. It was not\r\nso late\xe2\x80\x94Gerty might still be waking. And even if she were not,\r\nthe sound of the bell would penetrate every recess of her tiny\r\napartment, and rouse her to answer her friend\xe2\x80\x99s call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\n\r\nGerty Farish, the morning after the Wellington Brys\xe2\x80\x99 entertainment,\r\nwoke from dreams as happy as Lily\xe2\x80\x99s. If they were less vivid in\r\nhue, more subdued to the half-tints of her personality and her\r\nexperience, they were for that very reason better suited to her\r\nmental vision. Such flashes of joy as Lily moved in would have\r\nblinded Miss Farish, who was accustomed, in the way of happiness,\r\nto such scant light as shone through the cracks of other people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nNow she was the centre of a little illumination of her own: a mild\r\nbut unmistakable beam, compounded of Lawrence Selden\xe2\x80\x99s growing\r\nkindness to herself and the discovery that he extended his liking\r\nto Lily Bart. If these two factors seem incompatible to the student\r\nof feminine psychology, it must be remembered that Gerty had always\r\nbeen a parasite in the moral order, living on the crumbs of other\r\ntables, and content to look through the window at the banquet\r\nspread for her friends. Now that she was enjoying a little private\r\nfeast of her own, it would have seemed incredibly selfish not to\r\nlay a plate for a friend; and there was no one with whom she would\r\nrather have shared her enjoyment than Miss Bart.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s growing kindness, Gerty would no\r\nmore have dared to define it than she would have tried to learn\r\na butterfly\xe2\x80\x99s colours by knocking the dust from its wings. To\r\nseize on the wonder would be to brush off its bloom, and perhaps\r\nsee it fade and stiffen in her hand: better the sense of beauty\r\npalpitating out of reach, while she held her breath and watched\r\nwhere it would alight. Yet Selden\xe2\x80\x99s manner at the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 had brought\r\nthe flutter of wings so close that they seemed to be beating in\r\nher own heart. She had never seen him so alert, so responsive,\r\nso attentive to what she had to say. His habitual manner had an\r\nabsent-minded kindliness which she accepted, and was grateful for,\r\nas the liveliest sentiment her presence was likely to inspire; but\r\nshe was quick to feel in him a change implying that for once she\r\ncould give pleasure as well as receive it.\r\n\r\nAnd it was so delightful that this higher degree of sympathy should\r\nbe reached through their interest in Lily Bart!\r\n\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s affection for her friend\xe2\x80\x94a sentiment that had learned\r\nto keep itself alive on the scantiest diet\xe2\x80\x94had grown to active\r\nadoration since Lily\xe2\x80\x99s restless curiosity had drawn her into the\r\ncircle of Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s work. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s taste of beneficence had\r\nwakened in her a momentary appetite for well-doing. Her visit to\r\nthe Girls\xe2\x80\x99 Club had first brought her in contact with the dramatic\r\ncontrasts of life. She had always accepted with philosophic\r\ncalm the fact that such existences as hers were pedestalled on\r\nfoundations of obscure humanity. The dreary limbo of dinginess lay\r\nall around and beneath that little illuminated circle in which life\r\nreached its finest efflorescence, as the mud and sleet of a winter\r\nnight enclose a hot-house filled with tropical flowers. All this\r\nwas in the natural order of things, and the orchid basking in its\r\nartificially created atmosphere could round the delicate curves of\r\nits petals undisturbed by the ice on the panes.\r\n\r\nBut it is one thing to live comfortably with the abstract\r\nconception of poverty, another to be brought in contact with its\r\nhuman embodiments. Lily had never conceived of these victims of\r\nfate otherwise than in the mass. That the mass was composed of\r\nindividual lives, innumerable separate centres of sensation, with\r\nher own eager reachings for pleasure, her own fierce revulsions\r\nfrom pain\xe2\x80\x94that some of these bundles of feeling were clothed in\r\nshapes not so unlike her own, with eyes meant to look on gladness,\r\nand young lips shaped for love\xe2\x80\x94this discovery gave Lily one of\r\nthose sudden shocks of pity that sometimes decentralize a life.\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s nature was incapable of such renewal: she could feel other\r\ndemands only through her own, and no pain was long vivid which\r\ndid not press on an answering nerve. But for the moment she was\r\ndrawn out of herself by the interest of her direct relation with\r\na world so unlike her own. She had supplemented her first gift by\r\npersonal assistance to one or two of Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s most appealing\r\nsubjects, and the admiration and interest her presence excited\r\namong the tired workers at the club ministered in a new form to her\r\ninsatiable desire to please.\r\n\r\nGerty Farish was not a close enough reader of character to\r\ndisentangle the mixed threads of which Lily\xe2\x80\x99s philanthropy was\r\nwoven. She supposed her beautiful friend to be actuated by the\r\nsame motive as herself\xe2\x80\x94that sharpening of the moral vision which\r\nmakes all human suffering so near and insistent that the other\r\naspects of life fade into remoteness. Gerty lived by such simple\r\nformulas that she did not hesitate to class her friend\xe2\x80\x99s state\r\nwith the emotional \xe2\x80\x9cchange of heart\xe2\x80\x9d to which her dealings with\r\nthe poor had accustomed her; and she rejoiced in the thought that\r\nshe had been the humble instrument of this renewal. Now she had\r\nan answer to all criticisms of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s conduct: as she had said,\r\nshe knew \xe2\x80\x9cthe real Lily,\xe2\x80\x9d and the discovery that Selden shared her\r\nknowledge raised her placid acceptance of life to a dazzled sense\r\nof its possibilities\xe2\x80\x94a sense farther enlarged, in the course of the\r\nafternoon, by the receipt of a telegram from Selden asking if he\r\nmight dine with her that evening.\r\n\r\nWhile Gerty was lost in the happy bustle which this announcement\r\nproduced in her small household, Selden was at one with her in\r\nthinking with intensity of Lily Bart. The case which had called him\r\nto Albany was not complicated enough to absorb all his attention,\r\nand he had the professional faculty of keeping a part of his mind\r\nfree when its services were not needed. This part\xe2\x80\x94which at the\r\nmoment seemed dangerously like the whole\xe2\x80\x94was filled to the brim\r\nwith the sensations of the previous evening. Selden understood the\r\nsymptoms: he recognized the fact that he was paying up, as there\r\nhad always been a chance of his having to pay up, for the voluntary\r\nexclusions of his past. He had meant to keep free from permanent\r\nties, not from any poverty of feeling, but because, in a different\r\nway, he was, as much as Lily, the victim of his environment. There\r\nhad been a germ of truth in his declaration to Gerty Farish that he\r\nhad never wanted to marry a \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d girl: the adjective connoting,\r\nin his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary, certain utilitarian qualities which\r\nare apt to preclude the luxury of charm. Now it had been Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfate to have a charming mother: her graceful portrait, all smiles\r\nand Cashmere, still emitted a faded scent of the undefinable\r\nquality. His father was the kind of man who delights in a charming\r\nwoman: who quotes her, stimulates her, and keeps her perennially\r\ncharming. Neither one of the couple cared for money, but their\r\ndisdain of it took the form of always spending a little more than\r\nwas prudent. If their house was shabby, it was exquisitely kept; if\r\nthere were good books on the shelves there were also good dishes\r\non the table. Selden senior had an eye for a picture, his wife an\r\nunderstanding of old lace; and both were so conscious of restraint\r\nand discrimination in buying that they never quite knew how it was\r\nthat the bills mounted up.\r\n\r\nThough many of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s friends would have called his parents poor,\r\nhe had grown up in an atmosphere where restricted means were felt\r\nonly as a check on aimless profusion: where the few possessions\r\nwere so good that their rarity gave them a merited relief, and\r\nabstinence was combined with elegance in a way exemplified by Mrs.\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s knack of wearing her old velvet as if it were new. A man\r\nhas the advantage of being delivered early from the home point of\r\nview, and before Selden left college he had learned that there\r\nare as many different ways of going without money as of spending\r\nit. Unfortunately, he found no way as agreeable as that practised\r\nat home; and his views of womankind in especial were tinged by\r\nthe remembrance of the one woman who had given him his sense of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cvalues.\xe2\x80\x9d It was from her that he inherited his detachment from\r\nthe sumptuary side of life: the stoic\xe2\x80\x99s carelessness of material\r\nthings, combined with the Epicurean\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure in them. Life shorn\r\nof either feeling appeared to him a diminished thing; and nowhere\r\nwas the blending of the two ingredients so essential as in the\r\ncharacter of a pretty woman.\r\n\r\nIt had always seemed to Selden that experience offered a great deal\r\nbesides the sentimental adventure, yet he could vividly conceive of\r\na love which should broaden and deepen till it became the central\r\nfact of life. What he could not accept, in his own case, was the\r\nmakeshift alternative of a relation that should be less than this:\r\nthat should leave some portions of his nature unsatisfied, while it\r\nput an undue strain on others. He would not, in other words, yield\r\nto the growth of an affection which might appeal to pity yet leave\r\nthe understanding untouched: sympathy should no more delude him\r\nthan a trick of the eyes, the grace of helplessness than a curve of\r\nthe cheek.\r\n\r\nBut now\xe2\x80\x94that little BUT passed like a sponge over all his vows.\r\nHis reasoned-out resistances seemed for the moment so much less\r\nimportant than the question as to when Lily would receive his\r\nnote! He yielded himself to the charm of trivial preoccupations,\r\nwondering at what hour her reply would be sent, with what words\r\nit would begin. As to its import he had no doubt\xe2\x80\x94he was as sure\r\nof her surrender as of his own. And so he had leisure to muse on\r\nall its exquisite details, as a hard worker, on a holiday morning,\r\nmight lie still and watch the beam of light travel gradually\r\nacross his room. But if the new light dazzled, it did not blind\r\nhim. He could still discern the outline of facts, though his own\r\nrelation to them had changed. He was no less conscious than before\r\nof what was said of Lily Bart, but he could separate the woman he\r\nknew from the vulgar estimate of her. His mind turned to Gerty\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s words, and the wisdom of the world seemed a groping thing\r\nbeside the insight of innocence. BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART,\r\nFOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD\xe2\x80\x94even the hidden god in their neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreast! Selden was in the state of impassioned self-absorption\r\nthat the first surrender to love produces. His craving was for the\r\ncompanionship of one whose point of view should justify his own,\r\nwho should confirm, by deliberate observation, the truth to which\r\nhis intuitions had leaped. He could not wait for the midday recess,\r\nbut seized a moment\xe2\x80\x99s leisure in court to scribble his telegram to\r\nGerty Farish.\r\n\r\nReaching town, he was driven direct to his club, where he hoped a\r\nnote from Miss Bart might await him. But his box contained only\r\na line of rapturous assent from Gerty, and he was turning away\r\ndisappointed when he was hailed by a voice from the smoking room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Lawrence! Dining here? Take a bite with me\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered a\r\ncanvas-back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe discovered Trenor, in his day clothes, sitting, with a tall\r\nglass at his elbow, behind the folds of a sporting journal.\r\n\r\nSelden thanked him, but pleaded an engagement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, I believe every man in town has an engagement tonight. I\r\nshall have the club to myself. You know how I\xe2\x80\x99m living this winter,\r\nrattling round in that empty house. My wife meant to come to town\r\ntoday, but she\xe2\x80\x99s put it off again, and how is a fellow to dine\r\nalone in a room with the looking-glasses covered, and nothing but\r\na bottle of Harvey sauce on the sideboard? I say, Lawrence, chuck\r\nyour engagement and take pity on me\xe2\x80\x94it gives me the blue devils to\r\ndine alone, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody but that canting ass Wetherall in\r\nthe club.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, Gus\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Selden turned away, he noticed the dark flush on Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nthe unpleasant moisture of his intensely white forehead, the way\r\nhis jewelled rings were wedged in the creases of his fat red\r\nfingers. Certainly the beast was predominating\xe2\x80\x94the beast at the\r\nbottom of the glass. And he had heard this man\xe2\x80\x99s name coupled with\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s! Bah\xe2\x80\x94the thought sickened him; all the way back to his rooms\r\nhe was haunted by the sight of Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s fat creased hands\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOn his table lay the note: Lily had sent it to his rooms. He knew\r\nwhat was in it before he broke the seal\xe2\x80\x94a grey seal with BEYOND!\r\nbeneath a flying ship. Ah, he would take her beyond\xe2\x80\x94beyond the\r\nugliness, the pettiness, the attrition and corrosion of the soul\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s little sitting-room sparkled with welcome when Selden\r\nentered it. Its modest \xe2\x80\x9ceffects,\xe2\x80\x9d compact of enamel paint and\r\ningenuity, spoke to him in the language just then sweetest to his\r\near. It is surprising how little narrow walls and a low ceiling\r\nmatter, when the roof of the soul has suddenly been raised. Gerty\r\nsparkled too; or at least shone with a tempered radiance. He had\r\nnever before noticed that she had \xe2\x80\x9cpoints\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94really, some good fellow\r\nmight do worse.... Over the little dinner (and here, again, the\r\neffects were wonderful) he told her she ought to marry\xe2\x80\x94he was in a\r\nmood to pair off the whole world. She had made the caramel custard\r\nwith her own hands? It was sinful to keep such gifts to herself.\r\nHe reflected with a throb of pride that Lily could trim her own\r\nhats\xe2\x80\x94she had told him so the day of their walk at Bellomont.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak of Lily till after dinner. During the little\r\nrepast he kept the talk on his hostess, who, fluttered at being\r\nthe centre of observation, shone as rosy as the candle-shades she\r\nhad manufactured for the occasion. Selden evinced an extraordinary\r\ninterest in her household arrangements: complimented her on the\r\ningenuity with which she had utilized every inch of her small\r\nquarters, asked how her servant managed about afternoons out,\r\nlearned that one may improvise delicious dinners in a chafing-dish,\r\nand uttered thoughtful generalizations on the burden of a large\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the sitting-room again, where they fitted as\r\nsnugly as bits in a puzzle, and she had brewed the coffee, and\r\npoured it into her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s egg-shell cups, his eye, as he\r\nleaned back, basking in the warm fragrance, lighted on a recent\r\nphotograph of Miss Bart, and the desired transition was effected\r\nwithout an effort. The photograph was well enough\xe2\x80\x94but to catch\r\nher as she had looked last night! Gerty agreed with him\xe2\x80\x94never had\r\nshe been so radiant. But could photography capture that light?\r\nThere had been a new look in her face\xe2\x80\x94something different; yes,\r\nSelden agreed there had been something different. The coffee was\r\nso exquisite that he asked for a second cup: such a contrast to\r\nthe watery stuff at the club! Ah, your poor bachelor with his\r\nimpersonal club fare, alternating with the equally impersonal\r\nCUISINE of the dinner-party! A man who lived in lodgings missed\r\nthe best part of life\xe2\x80\x94he pictured the flavourless solitude of\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s repast, and felt a moment\xe2\x80\x99s compassion for the man.... But\r\nto return to Lily\xe2\x80\x94and again and again he returned, questioning,\r\nconjecturing, leading Gerty on, draining her inmost thoughts of\r\ntheir stored tenderness for her friend.\r\n\r\nAt first she poured herself out unstintingly, happy in this perfect\r\ncommunion of their sympathies. His understanding of Lily helped\r\nto confirm her own belief in her friend. They dwelt together on\r\nthe fact that Lily had had no chance. Gerty instanced her generous\r\nimpulses\xe2\x80\x94her restlessness and discontent. The fact that her life\r\nhad never satisfied her proved that she was made for better things.\r\nShe might have married more than once\xe2\x80\x94the conventional rich\r\nmarriage which she had been taught to consider the sole end of\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94but when the opportunity came she had always shrunk from\r\nit. Percy Gryce, for instance, had been in love with her\xe2\x80\x94every one\r\nat Bellomont had supposed them to be engaged, and her dismissal\r\nof him was thought inexplicable. This view of the Gryce incident\r\nchimed too well with Selden\xe2\x80\x99s mood not to be instantly adopted\r\nby him, with a flash of retrospective contempt for what had once\r\nseemed the obvious solution. If rejection there had been\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nwondered now that he had ever doubted it!\xe2\x80\x94then he held the key to\r\nthe secret, and the hillsides of Bellomont were lit up, not with\r\nsunset, but with dawn. It was he who had wavered and disowned the\r\nface of opportunity\xe2\x80\x94and the joy now warming his breast might have\r\nbeen a familiar inmate if he had captured it in its first flight.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point, perhaps, that a joy just trying its\r\nwings in Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s heart dropped to earth and lay still. She sat\r\nfacing Selden, repeating mechanically: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she has never been\r\nunderstood\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and all the while she herself seemed to be sitting\r\nin the centre of a great glare of comprehension. The little\r\nconfidential room, where a moment ago their thoughts had touched\r\nelbows like their chairs, grew to unfriendly vastness, separating\r\nher from Selden by all the length of her new vision of the\r\nfuture\xe2\x80\x94and that future stretched out interminably, with her lonely\r\nfigure toiling down it, a mere speck on the solitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is herself with a few people only; and you are one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe heard Selden saying. And again: \xe2\x80\x9cBe good to her, Gerty, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d and: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has it in her to become whatever she is believed to\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll help her by believing the best of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words beat on Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s brain like the sound of a language which\r\nhas seemed familiar at a distance, but on approaching is found to\r\nbe unintelligible. He had come to talk to her of Lily\xe2\x80\x94that was all!\r\nThere had been a third at the feast she had spread for him, and\r\nthat third had taken her own place. She tried to follow what he\r\nwas saying, to cling to her own part in the talk\xe2\x80\x94but it was all as\r\nmeaningless as the boom of waves in a drowning head, and she felt,\r\nas the drowning may feel, that to sink would be nothing beside the\r\npain of struggling to keep up.\r\n\r\nSelden rose, and she drew a deep breath, feeling that soon she\r\ncould yield to the blessed waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s? You say she was dining there? There\xe2\x80\x99s music\r\nafterward; I believe I had a card from her.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced at the\r\nfoolish pink-faced clock that was drumming out this hideous hour.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quarter past ten? I might look in there now; the Fisher evenings\r\nare amusing. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t kept you up too late, Gerty? You look\r\ntired\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve rambled on and bored you.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the unwonted overflow\r\nof his feelings, he left a cousinly kiss upon her cheek.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s, through the cigar smoke of the studio, a dozen\r\nvoices greeted Selden. A song was pending as he entered, and he\r\ndropped into a seat near his hostess, his eyes roaming in search\r\nof Miss Bart. But she was not there, and the discovery gave him a\r\npang out of all proportion to its seriousness; since the note in\r\nhis breast-pocket assured him that at four the next day they would\r\nmeet. To his impatience it seemed immeasurably long to wait, and\r\nhalf-ashamed of the impulse, he leaned to Mrs. Fisher to ask, as\r\nthe music ceased, if Miss Bart had not dined with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily? She\xe2\x80\x99s just gone. She had to run off, I forget where. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe wonderful last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that? Lily?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jack Stepney, from the depths of a\r\nneighbouring arm-chair. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m no prude, but when\r\nit comes to a girl standing there as if she was up at auction\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nthought seriously of speaking to cousin Julia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Jack had become our social censor?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher\r\nsaid to Selden with a laugh; and Stepney spluttered, amid the\r\ngeneral derision: \xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s a cousin, hang it, and when a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarried\xe2\x80\x94TOWN TALK was full of her this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: lively reading that was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ned Van Alstyne, stroking\r\nhis moustache to hide the smile behind it. \xe2\x80\x9cBuy the dirty sheet?\r\nNo, of course not; some fellow showed it to me\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99d heard the\r\nstories before. When a girl\xe2\x80\x99s as good-looking as that she\xe2\x80\x99d better\r\nmarry; then no questions are asked. In our imperfectly organized\r\nsociety there is no provision as yet for the young woman who claims\r\nthe privileges of marriage without assuming its obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I understand Lily is about to assume them in the shape of\r\nMr. Rosedale,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher said with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRosedale\xe2\x80\x94good heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Van Alstyne, dropping his\r\neye-glass. \xe2\x80\x9cStepney, that\xe2\x80\x99s your fault for foisting the brute on\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, confound it, you know, we don\xe2\x80\x99t MARRY Rosedale in our family,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nStepney languidly protested; but his wife, who sat in oppressive\r\nbridal finery at the other side of the room, quelled him with the\r\njudicial reflection: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Lily\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to\r\nhave too high a standard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear even Rosedale has been scared by the talk lately,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nFisher rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the sight of her last night sent him off his\r\nhead. What do you think he said to me after her TABLEAU? \xe2\x80\x98My God,\r\nMrs. Fisher, if I could get Paul Morpeth to paint her like that,\r\nthe picture\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate a hundred per cent in ten years.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove,\xe2\x80\x94but isn\xe2\x80\x99t she about somewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Van Alstyne,\r\nrestoring his glass with an uneasy glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she ran off while you were all mixing the punch down stairs.\r\nWhere was she going, by the way? What\xe2\x80\x99s on tonight? I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard\r\nof anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not a party, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said an inexperienced young Farish who\r\nhad arrived late. \xe2\x80\x9cI put her in her cab as I was coming in, and she\r\ngave the driver the Trenors\xe2\x80\x99 address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Trenors\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mrs. Jack Stepney. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the house is\r\nclosed\xe2\x80\x94Judy telephoned me from Bellomont this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she? That\xe2\x80\x99s queer. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken. Well, come now,\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s there, anyhow\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94oh, well\xe2\x80\x94the fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no head for\r\nnumbers,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off, admonished by the nudge of an adjoining\r\nfoot, and the smile that circled the room.\r\n\r\nIn its unpleasant light Selden had risen and was shaking hands with\r\nhis hostess. The air of the place stifled him, and he wondered why\r\nhe had stayed in it so long.\r\n\r\nOn the doorstep he stood still, remembering a phrase of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me you spend a good deal of time in the element you\r\ndisapprove of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell\xe2\x80\x94what had brought him there but the quest of her? It was her\r\nelement, not his. But he would lift her out of it, take her beyond!\r\nThat BEYOND! on her letter was like a cry for rescue. He knew\r\nthat Perseus\xe2\x80\x99s task is not done when he has loosed Andromeda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchains, for her limbs are numb with bondage, and she cannot rise\r\nand walk, but clings to him with dragging arms as he beats back to\r\nland with his burden. Well, he had strength for both\xe2\x80\x94it was her\r\nweakness which had put the strength in him. It was not, alas, a\r\nclean rush of waves they had to win through, but a clogging morass\r\nof old associations and habits, and for the moment its vapours\r\nwere in his throat. But he would see clearer, breathe freer in her\r\npresence: she was at once the dead weight at his breast and the\r\nspar which should float them to safety. He smiled at the whirl of\r\nmetaphor with which he was trying to build up a defence against the\r\ninfluences of the last hour. It was pitiable that he, who knew the\r\nmixed motives on which social judgments depend, should still feel\r\nhimself so swayed by them. How could he lift Lily to a freer vision\r\nof life, if his own view of her was to be coloured by any mind in\r\nwhich he saw her reflected?\r\n\r\nThe moral oppression had produced a physical craving for air, and\r\nhe strode on, opening his lungs to the reverberating coldness of\r\nthe night. At the corner of Fifth Avenue Van Alstyne hailed him\r\nwith an offer of company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalking? A good thing to blow the smoke out of one\xe2\x80\x99s head. Now\r\nthat women have taken to tobacco we live in a bath of nicotine.\r\nIt would be a curious thing to study the effect of cigarettes on\r\nthe relation of the sexes. Smoke is almost as great a solvent as\r\ndivorce: both tend to obscure the moral issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing could have been less consonant with Selden\xe2\x80\x99s mood than\r\nVan Alstyne\xe2\x80\x99s after-dinner aphorisms, but as long as the latter\r\nconfined himself to generalities his listener\xe2\x80\x99s nerves were in\r\ncontrol. Happily Van Alstyne prided himself on his summing-up of\r\nsocial aspects, and with Selden for audience was eager to show the\r\nsureness of his touch. Mrs. Fisher lived in an East side street\r\nnear the Park, and as the two men walked down Fifth Avenue the new\r\narchitectural developments of that versatile thoroughfare invited\r\nVan Alstyne\xe2\x80\x99s comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Greiner house, now\xe2\x80\x94a typical rung in the social ladder! The\r\nman who built it came from a MILIEU where all the dishes are put\r\non the table at once. His facade is a complete architectural meal;\r\nif he had omitted a style his friends might have thought the money\r\nhad given out. Not a bad purchase for Rosedale, though: attracts\r\nattention, and awes the Western sight-seer. By and bye he\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nout of that phase, and want something that the crowd will pass and\r\nthe few pause before. Especially if he marries my clever cousin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden dashed in with the query: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Wellington Brys\xe2\x80\x99? Rather\r\nclever of its kind, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were just beneath the wide white facade, with its rich\r\nrestraint of line, which suggested the clever corseting of a\r\nredundant figure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the next stage: the desire to imply that one has been to\r\nEurope, and has a standard. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Mrs. Bry thinks her house\r\na copy of the TRIANON; in America every marble house with gilt\r\nfurniture is thought to be a copy of the TRIANON. What a clever\r\nchap that architect is, though\xe2\x80\x94how he takes his client\xe2\x80\x99s measure!\r\nHe has put the whole of Mrs. Bry in his use of the composite\r\norder. Now for the Trenors, you remember, he chose the Corinthian:\r\nexuberant, but based on the best precedent. The Trenor house is\r\none of his best things\xe2\x80\x94doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a banqueting-hall turned\r\ninside out. I hear Mrs. Trenor wants to build out a new ball-room,\r\nand that divergence from Gus on that point keeps her at Bellomont.\r\nThe dimensions of the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 ball-room must rankle: you may be sure\r\nshe knows \xe2\x80\x99em as well as if she\xe2\x80\x99d been there last night with a\r\nyard-measure. Who said she was in town, by the way? That Farish\r\nboy? She isn\xe2\x80\x99t, I know; Mrs. Stepney was right; the house is dark,\r\nyou see: I suppose Gus lives in the back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had halted opposite the Trenors\xe2\x80\x99 corner, and Selden perforce\r\nstayed his steps also. The house loomed obscure and uninhabited;\r\nonly an oblong gleam above the door spoke of provisional occupancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve bought the house at the back: it gives them a hundred and\r\nfifty feet in the side street. There\xe2\x80\x99s where the ball-room\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbe, with a gallery connecting it: billiard-room and so on above.\r\nI suggested changing the entrance, and carrying the drawing-room\r\nacross the whole Fifth Avenue front; you see the front door\r\ncorresponds with the windows\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe walking-stick which Van Alstyne swung in demonstration dropped\r\nto a startled \xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d as the door opened and two figures were seen\r\nsilhouetted against the hall-light. At the same moment a hansom\r\nhalted at the curb-stone, and one of the figures floated down to it\r\nin a haze of evening draperies; while the other, black and bulky,\r\nremained persistently projected against the light.\r\n\r\nFor an immeasurable second the two spectators of the incident were\r\nsilent; then the house-door closed, the hansom rolled off, and the\r\nwhole scene slipped by as if with the turn of a stereopticon.\r\n\r\nVan Alstyne dropped his eye-glass with a low whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x94hem\xe2\x80\x94nothing of this, eh, Selden? As one of the family, I know I\r\nmay count on you\xe2\x80\x94appearances are deceptive\xe2\x80\x94and Fifth Avenue is so\r\nimperfectly lighted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Selden, turning sharply down the side street\r\nwithout seeing the other\xe2\x80\x99s extended hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlone with her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s kiss, Gerty stared upon her thoughts. He\r\nhad kissed her before\xe2\x80\x94but not with another woman on his lips. If\r\nhe had spared her that she could have drowned quietly, welcoming\r\nthe dark flood as it submerged her. But now the flood was shot\r\nthrough with glory, and it was harder to drown at sunrise than in\r\ndarkness. Gerty hid her face from the light, but it pierced to the\r\ncrannies of her soul. She had been so contented, life had seemed\r\nso simple and sufficient\xe2\x80\x94why had he come to trouble her with new\r\nhopes? And Lily\xe2\x80\x94Lily, her best friend! Woman-like, she accused\r\nthe woman. Perhaps, had it not been for Lily, her fond imagining\r\nmight have become truth. Selden had always liked her\xe2\x80\x94had understood\r\nand sympathized with the modest independence of her life. He, who\r\nhad the reputation of weighing all things in the nice balance of\r\nfastidious perceptions, had been uncritical and simple in his view\r\nof her: his cleverness had never overawed her because she had felt\r\nat home in his heart. And now she was thrust out, and the door\r\nbarred against her by Lily\xe2\x80\x99s hand! Lily, for whose admission there\r\nshe herself had pleaded! The situation was lighted up by a dreary\r\nflash of irony. She knew Selden\xe2\x80\x94she saw how the force of her faith\r\nin Lily must have helped to dispel his hesitations. She remembered,\r\ntoo, how Lily had talked of him\xe2\x80\x94she saw herself bringing the two\r\ntogether, making them known to each other. On Selden\xe2\x80\x99s part, no\r\ndoubt, the wound inflicted was inconscient; he had never guessed\r\nher foolish secret; but Lily\xe2\x80\x94Lily must have known! When, in such\r\nmatters, are a woman\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions at fault? And if she knew, then\r\nshe had deliberately despoiled her friend, and in mere wantonness\r\nof power, since, even to Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly flaming jealousy, it\r\nseemed incredible that Lily should wish to be Selden\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Lily\r\nmight be incapable of marrying for money, but she was equally\r\nincapable of living without it, and Selden\xe2\x80\x99s eager investigations\r\ninto the small economies of house-keeping made him appear to Gerty\r\nas tragically duped as herself.\r\n\r\nShe remained long in her sitting-room, where the embers were\r\ncrumbling to cold grey, and the lamp paled under its gay shade.\r\nJust beneath it stood the photograph of Lily Bart, looking out\r\nimperially on the cheap gimcracks, the cramped furniture of the\r\nlittle room. Could Selden picture her in such an interior? Gerty\r\nfelt the poverty, the insignificance of her surroundings: she\r\nbeheld her life as it must appear to Lily. And the cruelty of\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s judgments smote upon her memory. She saw that she had\r\ndressed her idol with attributes of her own making. When had Lily\r\never really felt, or pitied, or understood? All she wanted was\r\nthe taste of new experiences: she seemed like some cruel creature\r\nexperimenting in a laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe pink-faced clock drummed out another hour, and Gerty rose with\r\na start. She had an appointment early the next morning with a\r\ndistrict visitor on the East side. She put out her lamp, covered\r\nthe fire, and went into her bedroom to undress. In the little glass\r\nabove her dressing-table she saw her face reflected against the\r\nshadows of the room, and tears blotted the reflection. What right\r\nhad she to dream the dreams of loveliness? A dull face invited a\r\ndull fate. She cried quietly as she undressed, laying aside her\r\nclothes with her habitual precision, setting everything in order\r\nfor the next day, when the old life must be taken up as though\r\nthere had been no break in its routine. Her servant did not come\r\ntill eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and she prepared her own tea-tray and placed it\r\nbeside the bed. Then she locked the door of the flat, extinguished\r\nher light and lay down. But on her bed sleep would not come, and\r\nshe lay face to face with the fact that she hated Lily Bart. It\r\nclosed with her in the darkness like some formless evil to be\r\nblindly grappled with. Reason, judgment, renunciation, all the\r\nsane daylight forces, were beaten back in the sharp struggle for\r\nself-preservation. She wanted happiness\xe2\x80\x94wanted it as fiercely and\r\nunscrupulously as Lily did, but without Lily\xe2\x80\x99s power of obtaining\r\nit. And in her conscious impotence she lay shivering, and hated her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nA ring at the door-bell caught her to her feet. She struck a\r\nlight and stood startled, listening. For a moment her heart beat\r\nincoherently, then she felt the sobering touch of fact, and\r\nremembered that such calls were not unknown in her charitable work.\r\nShe flung on her dressing-gown to answer the summons, and unlocking\r\nher door, confronted the shining vision of Lily Bart.\r\n\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s first movement was one of revulsion. She shrank back as\r\nthough Lily\xe2\x80\x99s presence flashed too sudden a light upon her misery.\r\nThen she heard her name in a cry, had a glimpse of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, and felt herself caught and clung to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily\xe2\x80\x94what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart released her, and stood breathing brokenly, like one who\r\nhas gained shelter after a long flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so cold\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go home. Have you a fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s compassionate instincts, responding to the swift call of\r\nhabit, swept aside all her reluctances. Lily was simply some one\r\nwho needed help\xe2\x80\x94for what reason, there was no time to pause and\r\nconjecture: disciplined sympathy checked the wonder on Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips, and made her draw her friend silently into the sitting-room\r\nand seat her by the darkened hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is kindling wood here: the fire will burn in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt down, and the flame leapt under her rapid hands. It\r\nflashed strangely through the tears which still blurred her eyes,\r\nand smote on the white ruin of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s face. The girls looked at\r\neach other in silence; then Lily repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94you came here, dear! You\xe2\x80\x99re cold and tired\xe2\x80\x94sit quiet, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make you some tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGerty had unconsciously adopted the soothing note of her trade:\r\nall personal feeling was merged in the sense of ministry, and\r\nexperience had taught her that the bleeding must be stayed before\r\nthe wound is probed.\r\n\r\nLily sat quiet, leaning to the fire: the clatter of cups behind her\r\nsoothed her as familiar noises hush a child whom silence has kept\r\nwakeful. But when Gerty stood at her side with the tea she pushed\r\nit away, and turned an estranged eye on the familiar room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came here because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nGerty set down the cup and knelt beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily! Something has happened\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to lie awake in my room till morning. I hate my\r\nroom at Aunt Julia\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94so I came here\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stirred suddenly, broke from her apathy, and clung to Gerty in\r\na fresh burst of fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gerty, the furies . . . you know the noise of their\r\nwings\xe2\x80\x94alone, at night, in the dark? But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94there is\r\nnothing to make the dark dreadful to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words, flashing back on Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s last hours, struck from her a\r\nfaint derisive murmur; but Lily, in the blaze of her own misery,\r\nwas blinded to everything outside it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll let me stay? I shan\xe2\x80\x99t mind when daylight comes\xe2\x80\x94Is\r\nit late? Is the night nearly over? It must be awful to be\r\nsleepless\xe2\x80\x94everything stands by the bed and stares\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Farish caught her straying hands. \xe2\x80\x9cLily, look at me! Something\r\nhas happened\xe2\x80\x94an accident? You have been frightened\xe2\x80\x94what has\r\nfrightened you? Tell me if you can\xe2\x80\x94a word or two\xe2\x80\x94so that I can help\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not frightened: that\xe2\x80\x99s not the word. Can you imagine looking\r\ninto your glass some morning and seeing a disfigurement\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nhideous change that has come to you while you slept? Well, I seem\r\nto myself like that\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see myself in my own thoughts\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nhate ugliness, you know\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve always turned from it\xe2\x80\x94but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexplain to you\xe2\x80\x94you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head and her eyes fell on the clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long the night is! And I know I shan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep tomorrow. Some\r\none told me my father used to lie sleepless and think of horrors.\r\nAnd he was not wicked, only unfortunate\xe2\x80\x94and I see now how he must\r\nhave suffered, lying alone with his thoughts! But I am bad\xe2\x80\x94a bad\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x94all my thoughts are bad\xe2\x80\x94I have always had bad people about\r\nme. Is that any excuse? I thought I could manage my own life\xe2\x80\x94I was\r\nproud\xe2\x80\x94proud! but now I\xe2\x80\x99m on their level\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSobs shook her, and she bowed to them like a tree in a dry storm.\r\n\r\nGerty knelt beside her, waiting, with the patience born of\r\nexperience, till this gust of misery should loosen fresh speech.\r\nShe had first imagined some physical shock, some peril of the\r\ncrowded streets, since Lily was presumably on her way home from\r\nCarry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s; but she now saw that other nerve-centres were\r\nsmitten, and her mind trembled back from conjecture.\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s sobs ceased, and she lifted her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are bad girls in your slums. Tell me\xe2\x80\x94do they ever pick\r\nthemselves up? Ever forget, and feel as they did before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily! you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak so\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t they always go from bad to worse? There\xe2\x80\x99s no turning\r\nback\xe2\x80\x94your old self rejects you, and shuts you out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, stretching her arms as if in utter physical weariness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to bed, dear! You work hard and get up early. I\xe2\x80\x99ll watch here\r\nby the fire, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the light, and your door open. All\r\nI want is to feel that you are near me.\xe2\x80\x9d She laid both hands on\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, with a smile that was like sunrise on a sea\r\nstrewn with wreckage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave you, Lily. Come and lie on my bed. Your hands are\r\nfrozen\xe2\x80\x94you must undress and be made warm.\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty paused with sudden\r\ncompunction. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s past midnight! What will she\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe goes to bed. I have a latchkey. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nback there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need to: you shall stay here. But you must tell me\r\nwhere you have been. Listen, Lily\xe2\x80\x94it will help you to speak!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nregained Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and pressed them against her. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to\r\ntell me\xe2\x80\x94it will clear your poor head. Listen\xe2\x80\x94you were dining at\r\nCarry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty paused and added with a flash of heroism:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawrence Selden went from here to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the word, Lily\xe2\x80\x99s face melted from locked anguish to the open\r\nmisery of a child. Her lips trembled and her gaze widened with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went to find me? And I missed him! Oh, Gerty, he tried to help\r\nme. He told me\xe2\x80\x94he warned me long ago\xe2\x80\x94he foresaw that I should grow\r\nhateful to myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe name, as Gerty saw with a clutch at the heart, had loosened\r\nthe springs of self-pity in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s dry breast, and tear by\r\ntear Lily poured out the measure of her anguish. She had dropped\r\nsideways in Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s big arm-chair, her head buried where lately\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s had leaned, in a beauty of abandonment that drove home to\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s aching senses the inevitableness of her own defeat. Ah,\r\nit needed no deliberate purpose on Lily\xe2\x80\x99s part to rob her of her\r\ndream! To look on that prone loveliness was to see in it a natural\r\nforce, to recognize that love and power belong to such as Lily, as\r\nrenunciation and service are the lot of those they despoil. But if\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation seemed a fatal necessity, the effect that his\r\nname produced shook Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s steadfastness with a last pang. Men\r\npass through such superhuman loves and outlive them: they are the\r\nprobation subduing the heart to human joys. How gladly Gerty would\r\nhave welcomed the ministry of healing: how willingly have soothed\r\nthe sufferer back to tolerance of life! But Lily\xe2\x80\x99s self-betrayal\r\ntook this last hope from her. The mortal maid on the shore is\r\nhelpless against the siren who loves her prey: such victims are\r\nfloated back dead from their adventure.\r\n\r\nLily sprang up and caught her with strong hands. \xe2\x80\x9cGerty, you\r\nknow him\xe2\x80\x94you understand him\xe2\x80\x94tell me; if I went to him, if I told\r\nhim everything\xe2\x80\x94if I said: \xe2\x80\x98I am bad through and through\xe2\x80\x94I want\r\nadmiration, I want excitement, I want money\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 yes, MONEY! That\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nshame, Gerty\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s known, it\xe2\x80\x99s said of me\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s what men think of\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94If I said it all to him\xe2\x80\x94told him the whole story\xe2\x80\x94said plainly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve sunk lower than the lowest, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken what they take,\r\nand not paid as they pay\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94oh, Gerty, you know him, you can speak\r\nfor him: if I told him everything would he loathe me? Or would he\r\npity me, and understand me, and save me from loathing myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGerty stood cold and passive. She knew the hour of her probation\r\nhad come, and her poor heart beat wildly against its destiny. As a\r\ndark river sweeps by under a lightning flash, she saw her chance of\r\nhappiness surge past under a flash of temptation. What prevented\r\nher from saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is like other men?\xe2\x80\x9d She was not so sure of\r\nhim, after all! But to do so would have been like blaspheming her\r\nlove. She could not put him before herself in any light but the\r\nnoblest: she must trust him to the height of her own passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: I know him; he will help you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and in a moment\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s passion was weeping itself out against her breast.\r\n\r\nThere was but one bed in the little flat, and the two girls lay\r\ndown on it side by side when Gerty had unlaced Lily\xe2\x80\x99s dress\r\nand persuaded her to put her lips to the warm tea. The light\r\nextinguished, they lay still in the darkness, Gerty shrinking\r\nto the outer edge of the narrow couch to avoid contact with her\r\nbed-fellow. Knowing that Lily disliked to be caressed, she had long\r\nago learned to check her demonstrative impulses toward her friend.\r\nBut tonight every fibre in her body shrank from Lily\xe2\x80\x99s nearness:\r\nit was torture to listen to her breathing, and feel the sheet stir\r\nwith it. As Lily turned, and settled to completer rest, a strand\r\nof her hair swept Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s cheek with its fragrance. Everything\r\nabout her was warm and soft and scented: even the stains of her\r\ngrief became her as rain-drops do the beaten rose. But as Gerty lay\r\nwith arms drawn down her side, in the motionless narrowness of an\r\neffigy, she felt a stir of sobs from the breathing warmth beside\r\nher, and Lily flung out her hand, groped for her friend\xe2\x80\x99s, and held\r\nit fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold me, Gerty, hold me, or I shall think of things,\xe2\x80\x9d she moaned;\r\nand Gerty silently slipped an arm under her, pillowing her head in\r\nits hollow as a mother makes a nest for a tossing child. In the\r\nwarm hollow Lily lay still and her breathing grew low and regular.\r\nHer hand still clung to Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s as if to ward off evil dreams, but\r\nthe hold of her fingers relaxed, her head sank deeper into its\r\nshelter, and Gerty felt that she slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 15\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lily woke she had the bed to herself, and the winter light was\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nShe sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings;\r\nthen memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver.\r\nIn the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a\r\nneighbouring building, she saw her evening dress and opera\r\ncloak lying in a tawdry heap on a chair. Finery laid off is as\r\nunappetizing as the remains of a feast, and it occurred to Lily\r\nthat, at home, her maid\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance had always spared her the\r\nsight of such incongruities. Her body ached with fatigue, and with\r\nthe constriction of her attitude in Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s bed. All through her\r\ntroubled sleep she had been conscious of having no space to toss\r\nin, and the long effort to remain motionless made her feel as if\r\nshe had spent her night in a train.\r\n\r\nThis sense of physical discomfort was the first to assert itself;\r\nthen she perceived, beneath it, a corresponding mental prostration,\r\na languor of horror more insufferable than the first rush of her\r\ndisgust. The thought of having to wake every morning with this\r\nweight on her breast roused her tired mind to fresh effort. She\r\nmust find some way out of the slough into which she had stumbled:\r\nit was not so much compunction as the dread of her morning thoughts\r\nthat pressed on her the need of action. But she was unutterably\r\ntired; it was weariness to think connectedly. She lay back, looking\r\nabout the poor slit of a room with a renewal of physical distaste.\r\nThe outer air, penned between high buildings, brought no freshness\r\nthrough the window; steam-heat was beginning to sing in a coil of\r\ndingy pipes, and a smell of cooking penetrated the crack of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Gerty, dressed and hatted, entered with a cup\r\nof tea. Her face looked sallow and swollen in the dreary light, and\r\nher dull hair shaded imperceptibly into the tones of her skin.\r\n\r\nShe glanced shyly at Lily, asking in an embarrassed tone how she\r\nfelt; Lily answered with the same constraint, and raised herself up\r\nto drink the tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have been over-tired last night; I think I had a nervous\r\nattack in the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as the drink brought clearness\r\nto her sluggish thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not well; I am so glad you came here,\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how am I to get home? And Aunt Julia\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe knows; I telephoned early, and your maid has brought your\r\nthings. But won\xe2\x80\x99t you eat something? I scrambled the eggs myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily could not eat; but the tea strengthened her to rise and dress\r\nunder her maid\xe2\x80\x99s searching gaze. It was a relief to her that Gerty\r\nwas obliged to hasten away: the two kissed silently, but without a\r\ntrace of the previous night\xe2\x80\x99s emotion.\r\n\r\nLily found Mrs. Peniston in a state of agitation. She had sent for\r\nGrace Stepney and was taking digitalis. Lily breasted the storm of\r\nenquiries as best she could, explaining that she had had an attack\r\nof faintness on her way back from Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s; that, fearing\r\nshe would not have strength to reach home, she had gone to Miss\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s instead; but that a quiet night had restored her, and that\r\nshe had no need of a doctor.\r\n\r\nThis was a relief to Mrs. Peniston, who could give herself up\r\nto her own symptoms, and Lily was advised to go and lie down,\r\nher aunt\xe2\x80\x99s panacea for all physical and moral disorders. In\r\nthe solitude of her own room she was brought back to a sharp\r\ncontemplation of facts. Her daylight view of them necessarily\r\ndiffered from the cloudy vision of the night. The winged furies\r\nwere now prowling gossips who dropped in on each other for tea. But\r\nher fears seemed the uglier, thus shorn of their vagueness; and\r\nbesides, she had to act, not rave. For the first time she forced\r\nherself to reckon up the exact amount of her debt to Trenor; and\r\nthe result of this hateful computation was the discovery that she\r\nhad, in all, received nine thousand dollars from him. The flimsy\r\npretext on which it had been given and received shrivelled up\r\nin the blaze of her shame: she knew that not a penny of it was\r\nher own, and that to restore her self-respect she must at once\r\nrepay the whole amount. The inability thus to solace her outraged\r\nfeelings gave her a paralyzing sense of insignificance. She was\r\nrealizing for the first time that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dignity may cost more\r\nto keep up than her carriage; and that the maintenance of a moral\r\nattribute should be dependent on dollars and cents, made the world\r\nappear a more sordid place than she had conceived it.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, when Grace Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s prying eyes had been\r\nremoved, Lily asked for a word with her aunt. The two ladies\r\nwent upstairs to the sitting-room, where Mrs. Peniston seated\r\nherself in her black satin arm-chair tufted with yellow buttons,\r\nbeside a bead-work table bearing a bronze box with a miniature\r\nof Beatrice Cenci in the lid. Lily felt for these objects the\r\nsame distaste which the prisoner may entertain for the fittings\r\nof the court-room. It was here that her aunt received her rare\r\nconfidences, and the pink-eyed smirk of the turbaned Beatrice was\r\nassociated in her mind with the gradual fading of the smile from\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s lips. That lady\xe2\x80\x99s dread of a scene gave her an\r\ninexorableness which the greatest strength of character could not\r\nhave produced, since it was independent of all considerations of\r\nright or wrong; and knowing this, Lily seldom ventured to assail\r\nit. She had never felt less like making the attempt than on the\r\npresent occasion; but she had sought in vain for any other means of\r\nescape from an intolerable situation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston examined her critically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a bad colour, Lily:\r\nthis incessant rushing about is beginning to tell on you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart saw an opening. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s that, Aunt Julia;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had worries,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Peniston, shutting her lips with the snap of a\r\npurse closing against a beggar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to bother you with them,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I really\r\nbelieve my faintness last night was brought on partly by anxious\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have said Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s cook was enough to account for\r\nit. She has a woman who was with Maria Melson in 1891\xe2\x80\x94the spring of\r\nthe year we went to Aix\xe2\x80\x94and I remember dining there two days before\r\nwe sailed, and feeling SURE the coppers hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been scoured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ate much; I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat or sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d Lily paused, and\r\nthen said abruptly: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, Aunt Julia, I owe some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded perceptibly, but did not express the\r\nastonishment her niece had expected. She was silent, and Lily was\r\nforced to continue: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been foolish\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt you have: extremely foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Peniston interposed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fail to see how any one with your income, and no expenses\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\nmention the handsome presents I\xe2\x80\x99ve always given you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been most generous, Aunt Julia; I shall never forget\r\nyour kindness. But perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t quite realize the expense a\r\ngirl is put to nowadays\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that YOU are put to any expense except for your\r\nclothes and your railway fares. I expect you to be handsomely\r\ndressed; but I paid Celeste\xe2\x80\x99s bill for you last October.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily hesitated: her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s implacable memory had never been more\r\ninconvenient. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were as kind as possible; but I have had to get\r\na few things since\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of things? Clothes? How much have you spent? Let me see\r\nthe bill\xe2\x80\x94I daresay the woman is swindling you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I think not: clothes have grown so frightfully expensive;\r\nand one needs so many different kinds, with country visits, and\r\ngolf and skating, and Aiken and Tuxedo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see the bill,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Peniston repeated.\r\n\r\nLily hesitated again. In the first place, Mme. Celeste had not yet\r\nsent in her account, and secondly, the amount it represented was\r\nonly a fraction of the sum that Lily needed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sent in the bill for my winter things, but I KNOW it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge; and there are one or two other things; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been careless\r\nand imprudent\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m frightened to think of what I owe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised the troubled loveliness of her face to Mrs. Peniston,\r\nvainly hoping that a sight so moving to the other sex might not be\r\nwithout effect upon her own. But the effect produced was that of\r\nmaking Mrs. Peniston shrink back apprehensively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Lily, you are old enough to manage your own affairs, and\r\nafter frightening me to death by your performance of last night you\r\nmight at least choose a better time to worry me with such matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Peniston glanced at the clock, and swallowed a tablet of\r\ndigitalis. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you owe Celeste another thousand, she may send me\r\nher account,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as though to end the discussion at any\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, Aunt Julia; I hate to trouble you at such a time;\r\nbut I have really no choice\xe2\x80\x94I ought to have spoken sooner\xe2\x80\x94I owe a\r\ngreat deal more than a thousand dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great deal more? Do you owe two? She must have robbed you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you it was not only Celeste. I\xe2\x80\x94there are other bills\xe2\x80\x94more\r\npressing\xe2\x80\x94that must be settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth have you been buying? Jewelry? You must have gone\r\noff your head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Peniston with asperity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you have\r\nrun into debt, you must suffer the consequences, and put aside your\r\nmonthly income till your bills are paid. If you stay quietly here\r\nuntil next spring, instead of racing about all over the country,\r\nyou will have no expenses at all, and surely in four or five months\r\nyou can settle the rest of your bills if I pay the dress-maker now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily was again silent. She knew she could not hope to extract\r\neven a thousand dollars from Mrs. Peniston on the mere plea of\r\npaying Celeste\xe2\x80\x99s bill: Mrs. Peniston would expect to go over the\r\ndress-maker\xe2\x80\x99s account, and would make out the cheque to her and not\r\nto Lily. And yet the money must be obtained before the day was over!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe debts I speak of are\xe2\x80\x94different\xe2\x80\x94not like tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s bills,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe began confusedly; but Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s look made her almost\r\nafraid to continue. Could it be that her aunt suspected anything?\r\nThe idea precipitated Lily\xe2\x80\x99s avowal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve played cards a good deal\xe2\x80\x94bridge; the women all\r\ndo it; girls too\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s expected. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve won\xe2\x80\x94won a good\r\ndeal\xe2\x80\x94but lately I\xe2\x80\x99ve been unlucky\xe2\x80\x94and of course such debts can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\npaid off gradually\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused: Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s face seemed to be petrifying as she\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCards\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve played cards for money? It\xe2\x80\x99s true, then: when I was\r\ntold so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask if the other horrors\r\nI was told were true too; I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard enough for the state of my\r\nnerves. When I think of the example you\xe2\x80\x99ve had in this house! But I\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s your foreign bringing-up\xe2\x80\x94no one knew where your mother\r\npicked up her friends. And her Sundays were a scandal\xe2\x80\x94that I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston wheeled round suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou play cards on Sunday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily flushed with the recollection of certain rainy Sundays at\r\nBellomont and with the Dorsets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re hard on me, Aunt Julia: I have never really cared for\r\ncards, but a girl hates to be thought priggish and superior, and\r\none drifts into doing what the others do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a dreadful\r\nlesson, and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me out this time I promise you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Peniston raised her hand warningly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t make any\r\npromises: it\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary. When I offered you a home I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nundertake to pay your gambling debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Julia! You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you won\xe2\x80\x99t help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall certainly not do anything to give the impression that I\r\ncountenance your behaviour. If you really owe your dress-maker,\r\nI will settle with her\xe2\x80\x94beyond that I recognize no obligation to\r\nassume your debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily had risen, and stood pale and quivering before her aunt. Pride\r\nstormed in her, but humiliation forced the cry from her lips: \xe2\x80\x9cAunt\r\nJulia, I shall be disgraced\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But she could go no farther. If her\r\naunt turned such a stony ear to the fiction of the gambling debts,\r\nin what spirit would she receive the terrible avowal of the truth?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider that you ARE disgraced, Lily: disgraced by your conduct\r\nfar more than by its results. You say your friends have persuaded\r\nyou to play cards with them; well, they may as well learn a lesson\r\ntoo. They can probably afford to lose a little money\xe2\x80\x94and at any\r\nrate, I am not going to waste any of mine in paying them. And now I\r\nmust ask you to leave me\xe2\x80\x94this scene has been extremely painful, and\r\nI have my own health to consider. Draw down the blinds, please; and\r\ntell Jennings I will see no one this afternoon but Grace Stepney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily went up to her own room and bolted the door. She was trembling\r\nwith fear and anger\xe2\x80\x94the rush of the furies\xe2\x80\x99 wings was in her ears.\r\nShe walked up and down the room with blind irregular steps. The\r\nlast door of escape was closed\xe2\x80\x94she felt herself shut in with her\r\ndishonour.\r\n\r\nSuddenly her wild pacing brought her before the clock on the\r\nchimney-piece. Its hands stood at half-past three, and she\r\nremembered that Selden was to come to her at four. She had meant\r\nto put him off with a word\xe2\x80\x94but now her heart leaped at the\r\nthought of seeing him. Was there not a promise of rescue in his\r\nlove? As she had lain at Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s side the night before, she had\r\nthought of his coming, and of the sweetness of weeping out her\r\npain upon his breast. Of course she had meant to clear herself of\r\nits consequences before she met him\xe2\x80\x94she had never really doubted\r\nthat Mrs. Peniston would come to her aid. And she had felt, even\r\nin the full storm of her misery, that Selden\xe2\x80\x99s love could not be\r\nher ultimate refuge; only it would be so sweet to take a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshelter there, while she gathered fresh strength to go on.\r\n\r\nBut now his love was her only hope, and as she sat alone with her\r\nwretchedness the thought of confiding in him became as seductive\r\nas the river\xe2\x80\x99s flow to the suicide. The first plunge would be\r\nterrible\xe2\x80\x94but afterward, what blessedness might come! She remembered\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9cI know him\xe2\x80\x94he will help you\xe2\x80\x9d; and her mind clung\r\nto them as a sick person might cling to a healing relic. Oh, if\r\nhe really understood\xe2\x80\x94if he would help her to gather up her broken\r\nlife, and put it together in some new semblance in which no trace\r\nof the past should remain! He had always made her feel that she\r\nwas worthy of better things, and she had never been in greater\r\nneed of such solace. Once and again she shrank at the thought of\r\nimperilling his love by her confession: for love was what she\r\nneeded\xe2\x80\x94it would take the glow of passion to weld together the\r\nshattered fragments of her self-esteem. But she recurred to Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords and held fast to them. She was sure that Gerty knew Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeling for her, and it had never dawned upon her blindness that\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s own judgment of him was coloured by emotions far more\r\nardent than her own.\r\n\r\nFour o\xe2\x80\x99clock found her in the drawing-room: she was sure that\r\nSelden would be punctual. But the hour came and passed\xe2\x80\x94it moved\r\non feverishly, measured by her impatient heart-beats. She had\r\ntime to take a fresh survey of her wretchedness, and to fluctuate\r\nanew between the impulse to confide in Selden and the dread of\r\ndestroying his illusions. But as the minutes passed the need of\r\nthrowing herself on his comprehension became more urgent: she could\r\nnot bear the weight of her misery alone. There would be a perilous\r\nmoment, perhaps: but could she not trust to her beauty to bridge it\r\nover, to land her safe in the shelter of his devotion?\r\n\r\nBut the hour sped on and Selden did not come. Doubtless he had been\r\ndetained, or had misread her hurriedly scrawled note, taking the\r\nfour for a five. The ringing of the door-bell a few minutes after\r\nfive confirmed this supposition, and made Lily hastily resolve to\r\nwrite more legibly in future. The sound of steps in the hall, and\r\nof the butler\xe2\x80\x99s voice preceding them, poured fresh energy into her\r\nveins. She felt herself once more the alert and competent moulder\r\nof emergencies, and the remembrance of her power over Selden\r\nflushed her with sudden confidence. But when the drawing-room door\r\nopened it was Rosedale who came in.\r\n\r\nThe reaction caused her a sharp pang, but after a passing\r\nmovement of irritation at the clumsiness of fate, and at her\r\nown carelessness in not denying the door to all but Selden, she\r\ncontrolled herself and greeted Rosedale amicably. It was annoying\r\nthat Selden, when he came, should find that particular visitor in\r\npossession, but Lily was mistress of the art of ridding herself\r\nof superfluous company, and to her present mood Rosedale seemed\r\ndistinctly negligible.\r\n\r\nHis own view of the situation forced itself upon her after a few\r\nmoments\xe2\x80\x99 conversation. She had caught at the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 entertainment as\r\nan easy impersonal subject, likely to tide them over the interval\r\ntill Selden appeared, but Mr. Rosedale, tenaciously planted beside\r\nthe tea-table, his hands in his pockets, his legs a little too\r\nfreely extended, at once gave the topic a personal turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well done\xe2\x80\x94well, yes, I suppose it was: Welly Bry\xe2\x80\x99s got his\r\nback up and don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to let go till he\xe2\x80\x99s got the hang of the\r\nthing. Of course, there were things here and there\xe2\x80\x94things Mrs.\r\nFisher couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to see to\xe2\x80\x94the champagne wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cold,\r\nand the coats got mixed in the coat-room. I would have spent more\r\nmoney on the music. But that\xe2\x80\x99s my character: if I want a thing I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwilling to pay: I don\xe2\x80\x99t go up to the counter, and then wonder if\r\nthe article\xe2\x80\x99s worth the price. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied to entertain\r\nlike the Welly Brys; I\xe2\x80\x99d want something that would look more easy\r\nand natural, more as if I took it in my stride. And it takes just\r\ntwo things to do that, Miss Bart: money, and the right woman to\r\nspend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and examined her attentively while she affected to\r\nrearrange the tea-cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the money,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, clearing his throat, \xe2\x80\x9cand what\r\nI want is the woman\xe2\x80\x94and I mean to have her too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward a little, resting his hands on the head of his\r\nwalking-stick. He had seen men of Ned Van Alstyne\xe2\x80\x99s type bring\r\ntheir hats and sticks into a drawing-room, and he thought it added\r\na touch of elegant familiarity to their appearance.\r\n\r\nLily was silent, smiling faintly, with her eyes absently resting on\r\nhis face. She was in reality reflecting that a declaration would\r\ntake some time to make, and that Selden must surely appear before\r\nthe moment of refusal had been reached. Her brooding look, as of\r\na mind withdrawn yet not averted, seemed to Mr. Rosedale full of\r\na subtle encouragement. He would not have liked any evidence of\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to have her too,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with a laugh intended to\r\nstrengthen his self-assurance. \xe2\x80\x9cI generally HAVE got what I wanted\r\nin life, Miss Bart. I wanted money, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got more than I know\r\nhow to invest; and now the money doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be of any account\r\nunless I can spend it on the right woman. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to do\r\nwith it: I want my wife to make all the other women feel small. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever grudge a dollar that was spent on that. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t every\r\nwoman can do it, no matter how much you spend on her. There was a\r\ngirl in some history book who wanted gold shields, or something,\r\nand the fellows threw \xe2\x80\x99em at her, and she was crushed under \xe2\x80\x99em:\r\nthey killed her. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s true enough: some women looked buried\r\nunder their jewelry. What I want is a woman who\xe2\x80\x99ll hold her head\r\nhigher the more diamonds I put on it. And when I looked at you the\r\nother night at the Brys\xe2\x80\x99, in that plain white dress, looking as if\r\nyou had a crown on, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98By gad, if she had one she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwear it as if it grew on her.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill Lily did not speak, and he continued, warming with his theme:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell you what it is, though, that kind of woman costs more than\r\nall the rest of \xe2\x80\x99em put together. If a woman\xe2\x80\x99s going to ignore her\r\npearls, they want to be better than anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and so it is\r\nwith everything else. You know what I mean\xe2\x80\x94you know it\xe2\x80\x99s only the\r\nshowy things that are cheap. Well, I should want my wife to be able\r\nto take the earth for granted if she wanted to. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nthing vulgar about money, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the thinking about it; and my\r\nwife would never have to demean herself in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused,\r\nand then added, with an unfortunate lapse to an earlier manner: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nguess you know the lady I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in view, Miss Bart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily raised her head, brightening a little under the challenge.\r\nEven through the dark tumult of her thoughts, the clink of Mr.\r\nRosedale\xe2\x80\x99s millions had a faintly seductive note. Oh, for enough of\r\nthem to cancel her one miserable debt! But the man behind them grew\r\nincreasingly repugnant in the light of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s expected coming.\r\nThe contrast was too grotesque: she could scarcely suppress the\r\nsmile it provoked. She decided that directness would be best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean me, Mr. Rosedale, I am very grateful\xe2\x80\x94very much\r\nflattered; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I have ever done to make you\r\nthink\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not dead in love with me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got sense\r\nenough left to see that. And I ain\xe2\x80\x99t talking to you as if you\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94I presume I know the kind of talk that\xe2\x80\x99s expected under those\r\ncircumstances. I\xe2\x80\x99m confoundedly gone on you\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s about the size\r\nof it\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m just giving you a plain business statement of the\r\nconsequences. You\xe2\x80\x99re not very fond of me\xe2\x80\x94YET\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99re fond of\r\nluxury, and style, and amusement, and of not having to worry about\r\ncash. You like to have a good time, and not have to settle for it;\r\nand what I propose to do is to provide for the good time and do the\r\nsettling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and she returned with a chilling smile: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\nmistaken in one point, Mr. Rosedale: whatever I enjoy I am prepared\r\nto settle for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with the intention of making him see that, if his words\r\nimplied a tentative allusion to her private affairs, she was\r\nprepared to meet and repudiate it. But if he recognized her meaning\r\nit failed to abash him, and he went on in the same tone: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to give offence; excuse me if I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken too plainly. But\r\nwhy ain\xe2\x80\x99t you straight with me\xe2\x80\x94why do you put up that kind of\r\nbluff? You know there\xe2\x80\x99ve been times when you were bothered\xe2\x80\x94damned\r\nbothered\xe2\x80\x94and as a girl gets older, and things keep moving along,\r\nwhy, before she knows it, the things she wants are liable to move\r\npast her and not come back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere near that\r\nwith you yet; but you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a taste of bothers that a girl like\r\nyourself ought never to have known about, and what I\xe2\x80\x99m offering you\r\nis the chance to turn your back on them once for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe colour burned in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s face as he ended; there was no\r\nmistaking the point he meant to make, and to permit it to pass\r\nunheeded was a fatal confession of weakness, while to resent it too\r\nopenly was to risk offending him at a perilous moment. Indignation\r\nquivered on her lip; but it was quelled by the secret voice which\r\nwarned her that she must not quarrel with him. He knew too much\r\nabout her, and even at the moment when it was essential that he\r\nshould show himself at his best, he did not scruple to let her\r\nsee how much he knew. How then would he use his power when her\r\nexpression of contempt had dispelled his one motive for restraint?\r\nHer whole future might hinge on her way of answering him: she had\r\nto stop and consider that, in the stress of her other anxieties, as\r\na breathless fugitive may have to pause at the cross-roads and try\r\nto decide coolly which turn to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, Mr. Rosedale. I HAVE had bothers; and I am\r\ngrateful to you for wanting to relieve me of them. It is not always\r\neasy to be quite independent and self-respecting when one is poor\r\nand lives among rich people; I have been careless about money, and\r\nhave worried about my bills. But I should be selfish and ungrateful\r\nif I made that a reason for accepting all you offer, with no better\r\nreturn to make than the desire to be free from my anxieties. You\r\nmust give me time\xe2\x80\x94time to think of your kindness\xe2\x80\x94and of what I\r\ncould give you in return for it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand with a charming gesture in which dismissal\r\nwas shorn of its rigour. Its hint of future leniency made Rosedale\r\nrise in obedience to it, a little flushed with his unhoped-for\r\nsuccess, and disciplined by the tradition of his blood to accept\r\nwhat was conceded, without undue haste to press for more. Something\r\nin his prompt acquiescence frightened her; she felt behind it the\r\nstored force of a patience that might subdue the strongest will.\r\nBut at least they had parted amicably, and he was out of the house\r\nwithout meeting Selden\xe2\x80\x94Selden, whose continued absence now smote\r\nher with a new alarm. Rosedale had remained over an hour, and she\r\nunderstood that it was now too late to hope for Selden. He would\r\nwrite explaining his absence, of course; there would be a note\r\nfrom him by the late post. But her confession would have to be\r\npostponed; and the chill of the delay settled heavily on her fagged\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIt lay heavier when the postman\xe2\x80\x99s last ring brought no note for\r\nher, and she had to go upstairs to a lonely night\xe2\x80\x94a night as grim\r\nand sleepless as her tortured fancy had pictured it to Gerty.\r\nShe had never learned to live with her own thoughts, and to be\r\nconfronted with them through such hours of lucid misery made the\r\nconfused wretchedness of her previous vigil seem easily bearable.\r\n\r\nDaylight disbanded the phantom crew, and made it clear to her\r\nthat she would hear from Selden before noon; but the day passed\r\nwithout his writing or coming. Lily remained at home, lunching and\r\ndining alone with her aunt, who complained of flutterings of the\r\nheart, and talked icily on general topics. Mrs. Peniston went to\r\nbed early, and when she had gone Lily sat down and wrote a note to\r\nSelden. She was about to ring for a messenger to despatch it when\r\nher eye fell on a paragraph in the evening paper which lay at her\r\nelbow: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Lawrence Selden was among the passengers sailing this\r\nafternoon for Havana and the West Indies on the Windward Liner\r\nAntilles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid down the paper and sat motionless, staring at her note.\r\nShe understood now that he was never coming\xe2\x80\x94that he had gone away\r\nbecause he was afraid that he might come. She rose, and walking\r\nacross the floor stood gazing at herself for a long time in the\r\nbrightly lit mirror above the mantelpiece. The lines in her face\r\ncame out terribly\xe2\x80\x94she looked old; and when a girl looks old to\r\nherself, how does she look to other people? She moved away, and\r\nbegan to wander aimlessly about the room, fitting her steps with\r\nmechanical precision between the monstrous roses of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAxminster. Suddenly she noticed that the pen with which she had\r\nwritten to Selden still rested against the uncovered inkstand.\r\nShe seated herself again, and taking out an envelope, addressed\r\nit rapidly to Rosedale. Then she laid out a sheet of paper, and\r\nsat over it with suspended pen. It had been easy enough to write\r\nthe date, and \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but after that her inspiration\r\nflagged. She meant to tell him to come to her, but the words\r\nrefused to shape themselves. At length she began: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nthinking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d then she laid the pen down, and sat with her elbows on\r\nthe table and her face hidden in her hands.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she started up at the sound of the door-bell. It was\r\nnot late\xe2\x80\x94barely ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94and there might still be a note from\r\nSelden, or a message\xe2\x80\x94or he might be there himself, on the other\r\nside of the door! The announcement of his sailing might have been\r\na mistake\xe2\x80\x94it might be another Lawrence Selden who had gone to\r\nHavana\xe2\x80\x94all these possibilities had time to flash through her mind,\r\nand build up the conviction that she was after all to see or hear\r\nfrom him, before the drawing-room door opened to admit a servant\r\ncarrying a telegram.\r\n\r\nLily tore it open with shaking hands, and read Bertha Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nbelow the message: \xe2\x80\x9cSailing unexpectedly tomorrow. Will you join us\r\non a cruise in Mediterranean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK TWO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n\r\nIt came vividly to Selden on the Casino steps that Monte Carlo\r\nhad, more than any other place he knew, the gift of accommodating\r\nitself to each man\xe2\x80\x99s humour. His own, at the moment, lent it a\r\nfestive readiness of welcome that might well, in a disenchanted\r\neye, have turned to paint and facility. So frank an appeal for\r\nparticipation\xe2\x80\x94so outspoken a recognition of the holiday vein in\r\nhuman nature\xe2\x80\x94struck refreshingly on a mind jaded by prolonged\r\nhard work in surroundings made for the discipline of the senses.\r\nAs he surveyed the white square set in an exotic coquetry of\r\narchitecture, the studied tropicality of the gardens, the groups\r\nloitering in the foreground against mauve mountains which\r\nsuggested a sublime stage-setting forgotten in a hurried shifting\r\nof scenes\xe2\x80\x94as he took in the whole outspread effect of light and\r\nleisure, he felt a movement of revulsion from the last few months\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nThe New York winter had presented an interminable perspective of\r\nsnow-burdened days, reaching toward a spring of raw sunshine and\r\nfurious air, when the ugliness of things rasped the eye as the\r\ngritty wind ground into the skin. Selden, immersed in his work,\r\nhad told himself that external conditions did not matter to a man\r\nin his state, and that cold and ugliness were a good tonic for\r\nrelaxed sensibilities. When an urgent case summoned him abroad\r\nto confer with a client in Paris, he broke reluctantly with the\r\nroutine of the office; and it was only now that, having despatched\r\nhis business, and slipped away for a week in the south, he began to\r\nfeel the renewed zest of spectatorship that is the solace of those\r\nwho take an objective interest in life.\r\n\r\nThe multiplicity of its appeals\xe2\x80\x94the perpetual surprise of its\r\ncontrasts and resemblances! All these tricks and turns of the\r\nshow were upon him with a spring as he descended the Casino steps\r\nand paused on the pavement at its doors. He had not been abroad\r\nfor seven years\xe2\x80\x94and what changes the renewed contact produced! If\r\nthe central depths were untouched, hardly a pin-point of surface\r\nremained the same. And this was the very place to bring out the\r\ncompleteness of the renewal. The sublimities, the perpetuities,\r\nmight have left him as he was: but this tent pitched for a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrevelry spread a roof of oblivion between himself and his fixed sky.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-April, and one felt that the revelry had reached its\r\nclimax and that the desultory groups in the square and gardens\r\nwould soon dissolve and reform in other scenes. Meanwhile the last\r\nmoments of the performance seemed to gain an added brightness\r\nfrom the hovering threat of the curtain. The quality of the air,\r\nthe exuberance of the flowers, the blue intensity of sea and sky,\r\nproduced the effect of a closing TABLEAU, when all the lights are\r\nturned on at once. This impression was presently heightened by the\r\nway in which a consciously conspicuous group of people advanced\r\nto the middle front, and stood before Selden with the air of the\r\nchief performers gathered together by the exigencies of the final\r\neffect. Their appearance confirmed the impression that the show had\r\nbeen staged regardless of expense, and emphasized its resemblance\r\nto one of those \xe2\x80\x9ccostume-plays\xe2\x80\x9d in which the protagonists walk\r\nthrough the passions without displacing a drapery. The ladies stood\r\nin unrelated attitudes calculated to isolate their effects, and the\r\nmen hung about them as irrelevantly as stage heroes whose tailors\r\nare named in the programme. It was Selden himself who unwittingly\r\nfused the group by arresting the attention of one of its members.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Selden!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher exclaimed in surprise; and with a\r\ngesture toward Mrs. Jack Stepney and Mrs. Wellington Bry, she added\r\nplaintively: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re starving to death because we can\xe2\x80\x99t decide where\r\nto lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWelcomed into their group, and made the confidant of their\r\ndifficulty, Selden learned with amusement that there were several\r\nplaces where one might miss something by not lunching, or forfeit\r\nsomething by lunching; so that eating actually became a minor\r\nconsideration on the very spot consecrated to its rites.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course one gets the best things at the TERRASSE\xe2\x80\x94but that looks\r\nas if one hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any other reason for being there: the Americans\r\nwho don\xe2\x80\x99t know any one always rush for the best food. And the\r\nDuchess of Beltshire has taken up Becassin\xe2\x80\x99s lately,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bry\r\nearnestly summed up.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bry, to Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s despair, had not progressed beyond the\r\npoint of weighing her social alternatives in public. She could not\r\nacquire the air of doing things because she wanted to, and making\r\nher choice the final seal of their fitness.\r\n\r\nMr. Bry, a short pale man, with a business face and leisure\r\nclothes, met the dilemma hilariously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess the Duchess goes where it\xe2\x80\x99s cheapest, unless she can get\r\nher meal paid for. If you offered to blow her off at the TERRASSE\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d turn up fast enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Jack Stepney interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Dukes go to that\r\nlittle place at the Condamine. Lord Hubert says it\xe2\x80\x99s the only\r\nrestaurant in Europe where they can cook peas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Hubert Dacey, a slender shabby-looking man, with a charming\r\nworn smile, and the air of having spent his best years in piloting\r\nthe wealthy to the right restaurant, assented with gentle emphasis:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPEAS?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bry contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cCan they cook terrapin? It\r\njust shows,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat these European markets are, when a\r\nfellow can make a reputation cooking peas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack Stepney intervened with authority. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I quite\r\nagree with Dacey: there\xe2\x80\x99s a little hole in Paris, off the Quai\r\nVoltaire\xe2\x80\x94but in any case, I can\xe2\x80\x99t advise the Condamine GARGOTE; at\r\nleast not with ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStepney, since his marriage, had thickened and grown prudish, as\r\nthe Van Osburgh husbands were apt to do; but his wife, to his\r\nsurprise and discomfiture, had developed an earth-shaking fastness\r\nof gait which left him trailing breathlessly in her wake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99ll go then!\xe2\x80\x9d she declared, with a heavy toss of\r\nher plumage. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so tired of the TERRASSE: it\xe2\x80\x99s as dull as one\r\nof mother\xe2\x80\x99s dinners. And Lord Hubert has promised to tell us who\r\nall the awful people are at the other place\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Carry? Now,\r\nJack, don\xe2\x80\x99t look so solemn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bry, \xe2\x80\x9call I want to know is who their\r\ndress-makers are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt Dacey can tell you that too,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Stepney, with an\r\nironic intention which the other received with the light murmur,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can at least FIND OUT, my dear fellow\xe2\x80\x9d; and Mrs. Bry having\r\ndeclared that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t walk another step, the party hailed\r\ntwo or three of the light phaetons which hover attentively on the\r\nconfines of the gardens, and rattled off in procession toward the\r\nCondamine.\r\n\r\nTheir destination was one of the little restaurants overhanging\r\nthe boulevard which dips steeply down from Monte Carlo to the low\r\nintermediate quarter along the quay. From the window in which\r\nthey presently found themselves installed, they overlooked the\r\nintense blue curve of the harbour, set between the verdure of twin\r\npromontories: to the right, the cliff of Monaco, topped by the\r\nmediaeval silhouette of its church and castle, to the left the\r\nterraces and pinnacles of the gambling-house. Between the two,\r\nthe waters of the bay were furrowed by a light coming and going\r\nof pleasure-craft, through which, just at the culminating moment\r\nof luncheon, the majestic advance of a great steam-yacht drew the\r\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s attention from the peas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the Dorsets back!\xe2\x80\x9d Stepney exclaimed;\r\nand Lord Hubert, dropping his single eye-glass, corroborated: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe Sabrina\xe2\x80\x94yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo soon? They were to spend a month in Sicily,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess they feel as if they had: there\xe2\x80\x99s only one up-to-date\r\nhotel in the whole place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bry disparagingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Ned Silverton\xe2\x80\x99s idea\xe2\x80\x94but poor Dorset and Lily Bart must\r\nhave been horribly bored.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher added in an undertone to\r\nSelden: \xe2\x80\x9cI do hope there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s most awfully jolly having Miss Bart back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lord Hubert,\r\nin his mild deliberate voice; and Mrs. Bry added ingenuously: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndaresay the Duchess will dine with us, now that Lily\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duchess admires her immensely: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99d be charmed\r\nto have it arranged,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Hubert agreed, with the professional\r\npromptness of the man accustomed to draw his profit from\r\nfacilitating social contacts: Selden was struck by the businesslike\r\nchange in his manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily has been a tremendous success here,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher continued,\r\nstill addressing herself confidentially to Selden. \xe2\x80\x9cShe looks ten\r\nyears younger\xe2\x80\x94I never saw her so handsome. Lady Skiddaw took her\r\neverywhere in Cannes, and the Crown Princess of Macedonia had her\r\nto stop for a week at Cimiez. People say that was one reason why\r\nBertha whisked the yacht off to Sicily: the Crown Princess didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake much notice of her, and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to look on at Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntriumph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden made no reply. He was vaguely aware that Miss Bart was\r\ncruising in the Mediterranean with the Dorsets, but it had not\r\noccurred to him that there was any chance of running across her on\r\nthe Riviera, where the season was virtually at an end. As he leaned\r\nback, silently contemplating his filigree cup of Turkish coffee,\r\nhe was trying to put some order in his thoughts, to tell himself\r\nhow the news of her nearness was really affecting him. He had a\r\npersonal detachment enabling him, even in moments of emotional\r\nhigh-pressure, to get a fairly clear view of his feelings, and\r\nhe was sincerely surprised by the disturbance which the sight\r\nof the Sabrina had produced in him. He had reason to think that\r\nhis three months of engrossing professional work, following on\r\nthe sharp shock of his disillusionment, had cleared his mind of\r\nits sentimental vapours. The feeling he had nourished and given\r\nprominence to was one of thankfulness for his escape: he was like a\r\ntraveller so grateful for rescue from a dangerous accident that at\r\nfirst he is hardly conscious of his bruises. Now he suddenly felt\r\nthe latent ache, and realized that after all he had not come off\r\nunhurt.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, at Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s side in the Casino gardens, he was\r\ntrying to find fresh reasons for forgetting the injury received in\r\nthe contemplation of the peril avoided. The party had dispersed\r\nwith the loitering indecision characteristic of social movements\r\nat Monte Carlo, where the whole place, and the long gilded hours\r\nof the day, seem to offer an infinity of ways of being idle. Lord\r\nHubert Dacey had finally gone off in quest of the Duchess of\r\nBeltshire, charged by Mrs. Bry with the delicate negotiation of\r\nsecuring that lady\xe2\x80\x99s presence at dinner, the Stepneys had left for\r\nNice in their motor-car, and Mr. Bry had departed to take his place\r\nin the pigeon shooting match which was at the moment engaging his\r\nhighest faculties.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bry, who had a tendency to grow red and stertorous after\r\nluncheon, had been judiciously prevailed upon by Carry Fisher to\r\nwithdraw to her hotel for an hour\xe2\x80\x99s repose; and Selden and his\r\ncompanion were thus left to a stroll propitious to confidences.\r\nThe stroll soon resolved itself into a tranquil session on a bench\r\noverhung with laurel and Banksian roses, from which they caught a\r\ndazzle of blue sea between marble balusters, and the fiery shafts\r\nof cactus-blossoms shooting meteor-like from the rock. The soft\r\nshade of their niche, and the adjacent glitter of the air, were\r\nconducive to an easy lounging mood, and to the smoking of many\r\ncigarettes; and Selden, yielding to these influences, suffered Mrs.\r\nFisher to unfold to him the history of her recent experiences. She\r\nhad come abroad with the Welly Brys at the moment when fashion\r\nflees the inclemency of the New York spring. The Brys, intoxicated\r\nby their first success, already thirsted for new kingdoms, and\r\nMrs. Fisher, viewing the Riviera as an easy introduction to London\r\nsociety, had guided their course thither. She had affiliations\r\nof her own in every capital, and a facility for picking them up\r\nagain after long absences; and the carefully disseminated rumour\r\nof the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 wealth had at once gathered about them a group of\r\ncosmopolitan pleasure-seekers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut things are not going as well as I expected,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher\r\nfrankly admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well to say that every body with\r\nmoney can get into society; but it would be truer to say that\r\nNEARLY everybody can. And the London market is so glutted with new\r\nAmericans that, to succeed there now, they must be either very\r\nclever or awfully queer. The Brys are neither. HE would get on well\r\nenough if she\xe2\x80\x99d let him alone; they like his slang and his brag and\r\nhis blunders. But Louisa spoils it all by trying to repress him and\r\nput herself forward. If she\xe2\x80\x99d be natural herself\xe2\x80\x94fat and vulgar and\r\nbouncing\xe2\x80\x94it would be all right; but as soon as she meets anybody\r\nsmart she tries to be slender and queenly. She tried it with the\r\nDuchess of Beltshire and Lady Skiddaw, and they fled. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my\r\nbest to make her see her mistake\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to her again and again:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just let yourself go, Louisa\xe2\x80\x99; but she keeps up the humbug even\r\nwith me\xe2\x80\x94I believe she keeps on being queenly in her own room, with\r\nthe door shut.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst of it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall MY fault. When the Dorsets turned up here six weeks ago, and\r\neverybody began to make a fuss about Lily Bart, I could see Louisa\r\nthought that if she\xe2\x80\x99d had Lily in tow instead of me she would have\r\nbeen hob-nobbing with all the royalties by this time. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrealize that it\xe2\x80\x99s Lily\xe2\x80\x99s beauty that does it: Lord Hubert tells me\r\nLily is thought even handsomer than when he knew her at Aix ten\r\nyears ago. It seems she was tremendously admired there. An Italian\r\nPrince, rich and the real thing, wanted to marry her; but just at\r\nthe critical moment a good-looking step-son turned up, and Lily\r\nwas silly enough to flirt with him while her marriage-settlements\r\nwith the step-father were being drawn up. Some people said the\r\nyoung man did it on purpose. You can fancy the scandal: there was\r\nan awful row between the men, and people began to look at Lily\r\nso queerly that Mrs. Peniston had to pack up and finish her cure\r\nelsewhere. Not that SHE ever understood: to this day she thinks\r\nthat Aix didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit her, and mentions her having been sent there\r\nas proof of the incompetence of French doctors. That\xe2\x80\x99s Lily all\r\nover, you know: she works like a slave preparing the ground and\r\nsowing her seed; but the day she ought to be reaping the harvest\r\nshe over-sleeps herself or goes off on a picnic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher paused and looked reflectively at the deep shimmer of\r\nsea between the cactus-flowers. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just flightiness\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because, at heart,\r\nshe despises the things she\xe2\x80\x99s trying for. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty\r\nof deciding that makes her such an interesting study.\xe2\x80\x9d She glanced\r\ntentatively at Selden\xe2\x80\x99s motionless profile, and resumed with a\r\nslight sigh: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, all I can say is, I wish she\xe2\x80\x99d give ME some of\r\nher discarded opportunities. I wish we could change places now,\r\nfor instance. She could make a very good thing out of the Brys\r\nif she managed them properly, and I should know just how to look\r\nafter George Dorset while Bertha is reading Verlaine with Neddy\r\nSilverton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met Selden\xe2\x80\x99s sound of protest with a sharp derisive glance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of mincing matters? We all know that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nBertha brought her abroad for. When Bertha wants to have a good\r\ntime she has to provide occupation for George. At first I thought\r\nLily was going to play her cards well THIS time, but there are\r\nrumours that Bertha is jealous of her success here and at Cannes,\r\nand I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if there were a break any day. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly safeguard is that Bertha needs her badly\xe2\x80\x94oh, very badly.\r\nThe Silverton affair is in the acute stage: it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary that\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s attention should be pretty continuously distracted. And\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say Lily DOES distract it: I believe he\xe2\x80\x99d marry her\r\ntomorrow if he found out there was anything wrong with Bertha. But\r\nyou know him\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s as blind as he\xe2\x80\x99s jealous; and of course Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresent business is to keep him blind. A clever woman might know\r\njust the right moment to tear off the bandage: but Lily isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nclever in that way, and when George does open his eyes she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nprobably contrive not to be in his line of vision.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden tossed away his cigarette. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s time for my train,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe exclaimed, with a glance at his watch; adding, in reply to Mrs.\r\nFisher\xe2\x80\x99s surprised comment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought of course you were at\r\nMonte!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a murmured word to the effect that he was making Nice his\r\nhead-quarters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst of it is, she snubs the Brys now,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard irrelevantly\r\nflung after him.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, in the high-perched bedroom of an hotel\r\noverlooking the Casino, he was tossing his effects into a couple of\r\ngaping portmanteaux, while the porter waited outside to transport\r\nthem to the cab at the door. It took but a brief plunge down the\r\nsteep white road to the station to land him safely in the afternoon\r\nexpress for Nice; and not till he was installed in the corner of\r\nan empty carriage, did he exclaim to himself, with a reaction of\r\nself-contempt: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce am I running away from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pertinence of the question checked Selden\xe2\x80\x99s fugitive impulse\r\nbefore the train had started. It was ridiculous to be flying like\r\nan emotional coward from an infatuation his reason had conquered.\r\nHe had instructed his bankers to forward some important business\r\nletters to Nice, and at Nice he would quietly await them. He was\r\nalready annoyed with himself for having left Monte Carlo, where he\r\nhad intended to pass the week which remained to him before sailing;\r\nbut it would now be difficult to return on his steps without an\r\nappearance of inconsistency from which his pride recoiled. In his\r\ninmost heart he was not sorry to put himself beyond the probability\r\nof meeting Miss Bart. Completely as he had detached himself from\r\nher, he could not yet regard her merely as a social instance;\r\nand viewed in a more personal ways she was not likely to be a\r\nreassuring object of study. Chance encounters, or even the repeated\r\nmention of her name, would send his thoughts back into grooves\r\nfrom which he had resolutely detached them; whereas, if she could\r\nbe entirely excluded from his life, the pressure of new and varied\r\nimpressions, with which no thought of her was connected, would soon\r\ncomplete the work of separation. Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s conversation had,\r\nindeed, operated to that end; but the treatment was too painful\r\nto be voluntarily chosen while milder remedies were untried; and\r\nSelden thought he could trust himself to return gradually to a\r\nreasonable view of Miss Bart, if only he did not see her.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the station early, he had arrived at this point in\r\nhis reflections before the increasing throng on the platform warned\r\nhim that he could not hope to preserve his privacy; the next moment\r\nthere was a hand on the door, and he turned to confront the very\r\nface he was fleeing.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart, glowing with the haste of a precipitate descent upon the\r\ntrain, headed a group composed of the Dorsets, young Silverton and\r\nLord Hubert Dacey, who had barely time to spring into the carriage,\r\nand envelop Selden in ejaculations of surprise and welcome, before\r\nthe whistle of departure sounded. The party, it appeared, were\r\nhastening to Nice in response to a sudden summons to dine with the\r\nDuchess of Beltshire and to see the water-fete in the bay; a plan\r\nevidently improvised\xe2\x80\x94in spite of Lord Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s protesting \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\r\nsay, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for the express purpose of defeating Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nendeavour to capture the Duchess.\r\n\r\nDuring the laughing relation of this manoeuvre, Selden had time for\r\na rapid impression of Miss Bart, who had seated herself opposite\r\nto him in the golden afternoon light. Scarcely three months had\r\nelapsed since he had parted from her on the threshold of the Brys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nconservatory; but a subtle change had passed over the quality\r\nof her beauty. Then it had had a transparency through which the\r\nfluctuations of the spirit were sometimes tragically visible; now\r\nits impenetrable surface suggested a process of crystallization\r\nwhich had fused her whole being into one hard brilliant substance.\r\nThe change had struck Mrs. Fisher as a rejuvenation: to Selden it\r\nseemed like that moment of pause and arrest when the warm fluidity\r\nof youth is chilled into its final shape.\r\n\r\nHe felt it in the way she smiled on him, and in the readiness and\r\ncompetence with which, flung unexpectedly into his presence, she\r\ntook up the thread of their intercourse as though that thread had\r\nnot been snapped with a violence from which he still reeled. Such\r\nfacility sickened him\xe2\x80\x94but he told himself that it was with the\r\npang which precedes recovery. Now he would really get well\xe2\x80\x94would\r\neject the last drop of poison from his blood. Already he felt\r\nhimself calmer in her presence than he had learned to be in the\r\nthought of her. Her assumptions and elisions, her short-cuts and\r\nlong DETOURS, the skill with which she contrived to meet him at a\r\npoint from which no inconvenient glimpses of the past were visible,\r\nsuggested what opportunities she had had for practising such arts\r\nsince their last meeting. He felt that she had at last arrived at\r\nan understanding with herself: had made a pact with her rebellious\r\nimpulses, and achieved a uniform system of self-government, under\r\nwhich all vagrant tendencies were either held captive or forced\r\ninto the service of the state.\r\n\r\nAnd he saw other things too in her manner: saw how it had adjusted\r\nitself to the hidden intricacies of a situation in which, even\r\nafter Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s elucidating flashes, he still felt himself\r\nagrope. Surely Mrs. Fisher could no longer charge Miss Bart with\r\nneglecting her opportunities! To Selden\xe2\x80\x99s exasperated observation\r\nshe was only too completely alive to them. She was \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto every one: subservient to Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s anxious predominance,\r\ngood-naturedly watchful of Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s moods, brightly companionable\r\nto Silverton and Dacey, the latter of whom met her on an evident\r\nfooting of old admiration, while young Silverton, portentously\r\nself-absorbed, seemed conscious of her only as of something vaguely\r\nobstructive. And suddenly, as Selden noted the fine shades of\r\nmanner by which she harmonized herself with her surroundings, it\r\nflashed on him that, to need such adroit handling, the situation\r\nmust indeed be desperate. She was on the edge of something\xe2\x80\x94that was\r\nthe impression left with him. He seemed to see her poised on the\r\nbrink of a chasm, with one graceful foot advanced to assert her\r\nunconsciousness that the ground was failing her.\r\n\r\nOn the Promenade des Anglais, where Ned Silverton hung on him for\r\nthe half hour before dinner, he received a deeper impression of the\r\ngeneral insecurity. Silverton was in a mood of Titanic pessimism.\r\nHow any one could come to such a damned hole as the Riviera\xe2\x80\x94any\r\none with a grain of imagination\xe2\x80\x94with the whole Mediterranean to\r\nchoose from: but then, if one\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of a place depended on\r\nthe way they broiled a spring chicken! Gad! what a study might be\r\nmade of the tyranny of the stomach\xe2\x80\x94the way a sluggish liver or\r\ninsufficient gastric juices might affect the whole course of the\r\nuniverse, overshadow everything in reach\xe2\x80\x94chronic dyspepsia ought\r\nto be among the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory causes\xe2\x80\x9d; a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life might be ruined\r\nby a man\xe2\x80\x99s inability to digest fresh bread. Grotesque? Yes\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ntragic\xe2\x80\x94like most absurdities. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing grimmer than the\r\ntragedy that wears a comic mask.... Where was he? Oh\xe2\x80\x94the reason\r\nthey chucked Sicily and rushed back? Well\xe2\x80\x94partly, no doubt, Miss\r\nBart\xe2\x80\x99s desire to get back to bridge and smartness. Dead as a stone\r\nto art and poetry\xe2\x80\x94the light never WAS on sea or land for her! And\r\nof course she persuaded Dorset that the Italian food was bad for\r\nhim. Oh, she could make him believe anything\xe2\x80\x94ANYTHING! Mrs. Dorset\r\nwas aware of it\xe2\x80\x94oh, perfectly: nothing SHE didn\xe2\x80\x99t see! But she\r\ncould hold her tongue\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99d had to, often enough. Miss Bart was an\r\nintimate friend\xe2\x80\x94she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word against her. Only it hurts\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s pride\xe2\x80\x94there are some things one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get used to....\r\nAll this in confidence, of course? Ah\xe2\x80\x94and there were the ladies\r\nsignalling from the balcony of the hotel.... He plunged across the\r\nPromenade, leaving Selden to a meditative cigar.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions it led him to were fortified, later in the evening,\r\nby some of those faint corroborative hints that generate a light\r\nof their own in the dusk of a doubting mind. Selden, stumbling on\r\na chance acquaintance, had dined with him, and adjourned, still\r\nin his company, to the brightly lit Promenade, where a line of\r\ncrowded stands commanded the glittering darkness of the waters.\r\nThe night was soft and persuasive. Overhead hung a summer sky\r\nfurrowed with the rush of rockets; and from the east a late moon,\r\npushing up beyond the lofty bend of the coast, sent across the bay\r\na shaft of brightness which paled to ashes in the red glitter of\r\nthe illuminated boats. Down the lantern-hung Promenade, snatches\r\nof band-music floated above the hum of the crowd and the soft\r\ntossing of boughs in dusky gardens; and between these gardens and\r\nthe backs of the stands there flowed a stream of people in whom the\r\nvociferous carnival mood seemed tempered by the growing languor of\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nSelden and his companion, unable to get seats on one of the stands\r\nfacing the bay, had wandered for a while with the throng, and\r\nthen found a point of vantage on a high garden-parapet above the\r\nPromenade. Thence they caught but a triangular glimpse of the\r\nwater, and of the flashing play of boats across its surface; but\r\nthe crowd in the street was under their immediate view, and seemed\r\nto Selden, on the whole, of more interest than the show itself.\r\nAfter a while, however, he wearied of his perch and, dropping\r\nalone to the pavement, pushed his way to the first corner and\r\nturned into the moonlit silence of a side street. Long garden-walls\r\noverhung by trees made a dark boundary to the pavement; an empty\r\ncab trailed along the deserted thoroughfare, and presently Selden\r\nsaw two persons emerge from the opposite shadows, signal to the\r\ncab, and drive off in it toward the centre of the town. The\r\nmoonlight touched them as they paused to enter the carriage, and he\r\nrecognized Mrs. Dorset and young Silverton.\r\n\r\nBeneath the nearest lamp-post he glanced at his watch and saw\r\nthat the time was close on eleven. He took another cross street,\r\nand without breasting the throng on the Promenade, made his way\r\nto the fashionable club which overlooks that thoroughfare. Here,\r\namid the blaze of crowded baccarat tables, he caught sight of Lord\r\nHubert Dacey, seated with his habitual worn smile behind a rapidly\r\ndwindling heap of gold. The heap being in due course wiped out,\r\nLord Hubert rose with a shrug, and joining Selden, adjourned with\r\nhim to the deserted terrace of the club. It was now past midnight,\r\nand the throng on the stands was dispersing, while the long trails\r\nof red-lit boats scattered and faded beneath a sky repossessed by\r\nthe tranquil splendour of the moon.\r\n\r\nLord Hubert looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, I promised to join the\r\nDuchess for supper at the LONDON HOUSE; but it\xe2\x80\x99s past twelve, and\r\nI suppose they\xe2\x80\x99ve all scattered. The fact is, I lost them in the\r\ncrowd soon after dinner, and took refuge here, for my sins. They\r\nhad seats on one of the stands, but of course they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop\r\nquiet: the Duchess never can. She and Miss Bart went off in quest\r\nof what they call adventures\xe2\x80\x94gad, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t their fault if they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have some queer ones!\xe2\x80\x9d He added tentatively, after pausing\r\nto grope for a cigarette: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s an old friend of yours,\r\nI believe? So she told me.\xe2\x80\x94Ah, thanks\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have one\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d He lit Selden\xe2\x80\x99s proffered cigarette, and continued, in his\r\nhigh-pitched drawling tone: \xe2\x80\x9cNone of my business, of course, but I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t introduce her to the Duchess. Charming woman, the Duchess,\r\nyou understand; and a very good friend of mine; but RATHER a\r\nliberal education.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden received this in silence, and after a few puffs Lord Hubert\r\nbroke out again: \xe2\x80\x9cSort of thing one can\xe2\x80\x99t communicate to the young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94though young ladies nowadays are so competent to judge for\r\nthemselves; but in this case\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m an old friend too, you know . . .\r\nand there seemed no one else to speak to. The whole situation\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle mixed, as I see it\xe2\x80\x94but there used to be an aunt somewhere, a\r\ndiffuse and innocent person, who was great at bridging over chasms\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t see.... Ah, in New York, is she? Pity New York\xe2\x80\x99s such a\r\nlong way off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Bart, emerging late the next morning from her cabin, found\r\nherself alone on the deck of the Sabrina.\r\n\r\nThe cushioned chairs, disposed expectantly under the wide awning,\r\nshowed no signs of recent occupancy, and she presently learned\r\nfrom a steward that Mrs. Dorset had not yet appeared, and that\r\nthe gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94separately\xe2\x80\x94had gone ashore as soon as they had\r\nbreakfasted. Supplied with these facts, Lily leaned awhile over the\r\nside, giving herself up to a leisurely enjoyment of the spectacle\r\nbefore her. Unclouded sunlight enveloped sea and shore in a bath\r\nof purest radiancy. The purpling waters drew a sharp white line of\r\nfoam at the base of the shore; against its irregular eminences,\r\nhotels and villas flashed from the greyish verdure of olive and\r\neucalyptus; and the background of bare and finely-pencilled\r\nmountains quivered in a pale intensity of light.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful it was\xe2\x80\x94and how she loved beauty! She had always\r\nfelt that her sensibility in this direction made up for certain\r\nobtusenesses of feeling of which she was less proud; and during the\r\nlast three months she had indulged it passionately. The Dorsets\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninvitation to go abroad with them had come as an almost miraculous\r\nrelease from crushing difficulties; and her faculty for renewing\r\nherself in new scenes, and casting off problems of conduct as\r\neasily as the surroundings in which they had arisen, made the mere\r\nchange from one place to another seem, not merely a postponement,\r\nbut a solution of her troubles. Moral complications existed for her\r\nonly in the environment that had produced them; she did not mean\r\nto slight or ignore them, but they lost their reality when they\r\nchanged their background. She could not have remained in New York\r\nwithout repaying the money she owed to Trenor; to acquit herself\r\nof that odious debt she might even have faced a marriage with\r\nRosedale; but the accident of placing the Atlantic between herself\r\nand her obligations made them dwindle out of sight as if they had\r\nbeen milestones and she had travelled past them.\r\n\r\nHer two months on the Sabrina had been especially calculated to\r\naid this illusion of distance. She had been plunged into new\r\nscenes, and had found in them a renewal of old hopes and ambitions.\r\nThe cruise itself charmed her as a romantic adventure. She was\r\nvaguely touched by the names and scenes amid which she moved, and\r\nhad listened to Ned Silverton reading Theocritus by moonlight,\r\nas the yacht rounded the Sicilian promontories, with a thrill\r\nof the nerves that confirmed her belief in her intellectual\r\nsuperiority. But the weeks at Cannes and Nice had really given\r\nher more pleasure. The gratification of being welcomed in high\r\ncompany, and of making her own ascendency felt there, so that she\r\nfound herself figuring once more as the \xe2\x80\x9cbeautiful Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe interesting journal devoted to recording the least movements\r\nof her cosmopolitan companions\xe2\x80\x94all these experiences tended to\r\nthrow into the extreme background of memory the prosaic and sordid\r\ndifficulties from which she had escaped.\r\n\r\nIf she was faintly aware of fresh difficulties ahead, she was\r\nsure of her ability to meet them: it was characteristic of her to\r\nfeel that the only problems she could not solve were those with\r\nwhich she was familiar. Meanwhile she could honestly be proud of\r\nthe skill with which she had adapted herself to somewhat delicate\r\nconditions. She had reason to think that she had made herself\r\nequally necessary to her host and hostess; and if only she had seen\r\nany perfectly irreproachable means of drawing a financial profit\r\nfrom the situation, there would have been no cloud on her horizon.\r\nThe truth was that her funds, as usual, were inconveniently low;\r\nand to neither Dorset nor his wife could this vulgar embarrassment\r\nbe safely hinted. Still, the need was not a pressing one; she could\r\nworry along, as she had so often done before, with the hope of some\r\nhappy change of fortune to sustain her; and meanwhile life was\r\ngay and beautiful and easy, and she was conscious of figuring not\r\nunworthily in such a setting.\r\n\r\nShe was engaged to breakfast that morning with the Duchess of\r\nBeltshire, and at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock she asked to be set ashore in the\r\ngig. Before this she had sent her maid to enquire if she might see\r\nMrs. Dorset; but the reply came back that the latter was tired,\r\nand trying to sleep. Lily thought she understood the reason of\r\nthe rebuff. Her hostess had not been included in the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitation, though she herself had made the most loyal efforts in\r\nthat direction. But her grace was impervious to hints, and invited\r\nor omitted as she chose. It was not Lily\xe2\x80\x99s fault if Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplicated attitudes did not fall in with the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s easy gait.\r\nThe Duchess, who seldom explained herself, had not formulated her\r\nobjection beyond saying: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s rather a bore, you know. The only\r\none of your friends I like is that little Mr. Bry\xe2\x80\x94HE\xe2\x80\x99S funny\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nLily knew enough not to press the point, and was not altogether\r\nsorry to be thus distinguished at her friend\xe2\x80\x99s expense. Bertha\r\ncertainly HAD grown tiresome since she had taken to poetry and Ned\r\nSilverton.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it was a relief to break away now and then from\r\nthe Sabrina; and the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s little breakfast, organized by\r\nLord Hubert with all his usual virtuosity, was the pleasanter\r\nto Lily for not including her travelling-companions. Dorset, of\r\nlate, had grown more than usually morose and incalculable, and\r\nNed Silverton went about with an air that seemed to challenge the\r\nuniverse. The freedom and lightness of the ducal intercourse made\r\nan agreeable change from these complications, and Lily was tempted,\r\nafter luncheon, to adjourn in the wake of her companions to the\r\nhectic atmosphere of the Casino. She did not mean to play; her\r\ndiminished pocket-money offered small scope for the adventure; but\r\nit amused her to sit on a divan, under the doubtful protection of\r\nthe Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s back, while the latter hung above her stakes at a\r\nneighbouring table.\r\n\r\nThe rooms were packed with the gazing throng which, in the\r\nafternoon hours, trickles heavily between the tables, like the\r\nSunday crowd in a lion-house. In the stagnant flow of the mass,\r\nidentities were hardly distinguishable; but Lily presently saw\r\nMrs. Bry cleaving her determined way through the doors, and, in\r\nthe broad wake she left, the light figure of Mrs. Fisher bobbing\r\nafter her like a row-boat at the stern of a tug. Mrs. Bry pressed\r\non, evidently animated by the resolve to reach a certain point in\r\nthe rooms; but Mrs. Fisher, as she passed Lily, broke from her\r\ntowing-line, and let herself float to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLose her?\xe2\x80\x9d she echoed the latter\xe2\x80\x99s query, with an indifferent\r\nglance at Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s retreating back. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay\xe2\x80\x94it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter:\r\nI HAVE lost her already.\xe2\x80\x9d And, as Lily exclaimed, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhad an awful row this morning. You know, of course, that the\r\nDuchess chucked her at dinner last night, and she thinks it was my\r\nfault\xe2\x80\x94my want of management. The worst of it is, the message\xe2\x80\x94just a\r\nmere word by telephone\xe2\x80\x94came so late that the dinner HAD to be paid\r\nfor; and Becassin HAD run it up\xe2\x80\x94it had been so drummed into him\r\nthat the Duchess was coming!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher indulged in a faint laugh\r\nat the remembrance. \xe2\x80\x9cPaying for what she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get rankles so\r\ndreadfully with Louisa: I can\xe2\x80\x99t make her see that it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the\r\npreliminary steps to getting what you haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid for\xe2\x80\x94and as I was\r\nthe nearest thing to smash, she smashed me to atoms, poor dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily murmured her commiseration. Impulses of sympathy came\r\nnaturally to her, and it was instinctive to proffer her help to\r\nMrs. Fisher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can do\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s only a question of meeting\r\nthe Duchess! I heard her say she thought Mr. Bry amusing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Fisher interposed with a decisive gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\r\nI have my pride: the pride of my trade. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage the\r\nDuchess, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t palm off your arts on Louisa Bry as mine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntaken the final step: I go to Paris tonight with the Sam Gormers.\r\nTHEY\xe2\x80\x99RE still in the elementary stage; an Italian Prince is a great\r\ndeal more than a Prince to them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re always on the brink\r\nof taking a courier for one. To save them from that is my present\r\nmission.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed again at the picture. \xe2\x80\x9cBut before I go I want\r\nto make my last will and testament\xe2\x80\x94I want to leave you the Brys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart joined in her amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s charming of you to\r\nremember me, dear; but really\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re already so well provided for?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher flashed a sharp\r\nglance at her. \xe2\x80\x9cARE you, though, Lily\xe2\x80\x94to the point of rejecting my\r\noffer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart coloured slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I really meant was, that the Brys\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least care to be so disposed of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher continued to probe her embarrassment with an\r\nunflinching eye. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you really meant was that you\xe2\x80\x99ve snubbed the\r\nBrys horribly; and you know that they know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, on certain sides Louisa bristles with perceptions. If you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\neven managed to have them asked once on the Sabrina\xe2\x80\x94especially when\r\nroyalties were coming! But it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late,\xe2\x80\x9d she ended earnestly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not too late for either of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cStay over, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the Duchess to dine with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t stay over\xe2\x80\x94the Gormers have paid for my SALON-LIT,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Fisher with simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut get the Duchess to dine with them\r\nall the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s smile again flowed into a slight laugh: her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimportunity was beginning to strike her as irrelevant. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\r\nhave been negligent about the Brys\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to the Brys\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s you I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Fisher\r\nabruptly. She paused, and then, bending forward, with a lowered\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know we all went on to Nice last night when the Duchess\r\nchucked us. It was Louisa\xe2\x80\x99s idea\xe2\x80\x94I told her what I thought of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart assented. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I caught sight of you on the way back, at\r\nthe station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the man who was in the carriage with you and George\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x94that horrid little Dabham who does \xe2\x80\x98Society Notes from\r\nthe Riviera\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94had been dining with us at Nice. And he\xe2\x80\x99s telling\r\neverybody that you and Dorset came back alone after midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone\xe2\x80\x94? When he was with us?\xe2\x80\x9d Lily laughed, but her laugh faded\r\ninto gravity under the prolonged implication of Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe DID come back alone\xe2\x80\x94if that\xe2\x80\x99s so very dreadful! But whose fault\r\nwas it? The Duchess was spending the night at Cimiez with the Crown\r\nPrincess; Bertha got bored with the show, and went off early,\r\npromising to meet us at the station. We turned up on time, but she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94she didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn up at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart made this announcement in the tone of one who presents,\r\nwith careless assurance, a complete vindication; but Mrs. Fisher\r\nreceived it in a manner almost inconsequent. She seemed to have\r\nlost sight of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s part in the incident: her inward vision\r\nhad taken another slant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBertha never turned up at all? Then how on earth did she get back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the next train, I suppose; there were two extra ones for\r\nthe FETE. At any rate, I know she\xe2\x80\x99s safe on the yacht, though I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t yet seen her; but you see it was not my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily summed\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot your fault that Bertha didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn up? My poor child, if only\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for it!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher rose\xe2\x80\x94she had seen Mrs.\r\nBry surging back in her direction. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Louisa, and I must\r\nbe off\xe2\x80\x94oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the best of terms externally; we\xe2\x80\x99re lunching\r\ntogether; but at heart it\xe2\x80\x99s ME she\xe2\x80\x99s lunching on,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained;\r\nand with a last hand-clasp and a last look, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, I\r\nleave her to you; she\xe2\x80\x99s hovering now, ready to take you in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLily carried the impression of Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s leave-taking away with\r\nher from the Casino doors. She had accomplished, before leaving,\r\nthe first step toward her reinstatement in Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s good graces.\r\nAn affable advance\xe2\x80\x94a vague murmur that they must see more of each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x94an allusive glance to a near future that was felt to include\r\nthe Duchess as well as the Sabrina\xe2\x80\x94how easily it was all done, if\r\none possessed the knack of doing it! She wondered at herself, as\r\nshe had so often wondered, that, possessing the knack, she did not\r\nmore consistently exercise it. But sometimes she was forgetful\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsometimes, could it be that she was proud? Today, at any rate, she\r\nhad been vaguely conscious of a reason for sinking her pride, had\r\nin fact even sunk it to the point of suggesting to Lord Hubert\r\nDacey, whom she ran across on the Casino steps, that he might\r\nreally get the Duchess to dine with the Brys, if SHE undertook to\r\nhave them asked on the Sabrina. Lord Hubert had promised his help,\r\nwith the readiness on which she could always count: it was his only\r\nway of ever reminding her that he had once been ready to do so much\r\nmore for her. Her path, in short, seemed to smooth itself before\r\nher as she advanced; yet the faint stir of uneasiness persisted.\r\nHad it been produced, she wondered, by her chance meeting with\r\nSelden? She thought not\xe2\x80\x94time and change seemed so completely to\r\nhave relegated him to his proper distance. The sudden and exquisite\r\nreaction from her anxieties had had the effect of throwing the\r\nrecent past so far back that even Selden, as part of it, retained\r\na certain air of unreality. And he had made it so clear that they\r\nwere not to meet again; that he had merely dropped down to Nice\r\nfor a day or two, and had almost his foot on the next steamer.\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94that part of the past had merely surged up for a moment on the\r\nfleeing surface of events; and now that it was submerged again, the\r\nuncertainty, the apprehension persisted.\r\n\r\nThey grew to sudden acuteness as she caught sight of George Dorset\r\ndescending the steps of the Hotel de Paris and making for her\r\nacross the square. She had meant to drive down to the quay and\r\nregain the yacht; but she now had the immediate impression that\r\nsomething more was to happen first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich way are you going? Shall we walk a bit?\xe2\x80\x9d he began, putting\r\nthe second question before the first was answered, and not waiting\r\nfor a reply to either before he directed her silently toward the\r\ncomparative seclusion of the lower gardens.\r\n\r\nShe detected in him at once all the signs of extreme nervous\r\ntension. The skin was puffed out under his sunken eyes, and its\r\nsallowness had paled to a leaden white against which his irregular\r\neyebrows and long reddish moustache were relieved with a saturnine\r\neffect. His appearance, in short, presented an odd mixture of the\r\nbedraggled and the ferocious.\r\n\r\nHe walked beside her in silence, with quick precipitate steps, till\r\nthey reached the embowered slopes to the east of the Casino; then,\r\npulling up abruptly, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Bertha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94when I left the yacht she was not yet up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe received this with a laugh like the whirring sound in a disabled\r\nclock. \xe2\x80\x9cNot yet up? Had she gone to bed? Do you know at what time\r\nshe came on board? This morning at seven!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt seven?\xe2\x80\x9d Lily started. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened\xe2\x80\x94an accident to the train?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cThey missed the train\xe2\x80\x94all the trains\xe2\x80\x94they had to\r\ndrive back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d She hesitated, feeling at once how little even this\r\nnecessity accounted for the fatal lapse of hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a carriage at once\xe2\x80\x94at that time of night,\r\nyou know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d the explanatory note made it almost seem as though he\r\nwere putting the case for his wife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand when they finally did, it\r\nwas only a one-horse cab, and the horse was lame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow tiresome! I see,\xe2\x80\x9d she affirmed, with the more earnestness\r\nbecause she was so nervously conscious that she did not; and after\r\na pause she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry\xe2\x80\x94but ought we to have waited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaited for the one-horse cab? It would scarcely have carried the\r\nfour of us, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took this in what seemed the only possible way, with a laugh\r\nintended to sink the question itself in his humorous treatment of\r\nit. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it would have been difficult; we should have had to walk\r\nby turns. But it would have been jolly to see the sunrise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: the sunrise WAS jolly,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it? You saw it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw it, yes; from the deck. I waited up for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally\xe2\x80\x94I suppose you were worried. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you call on me to\r\nshare your vigil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood still, dragging at his moustache with a lean weak hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think you would have cared for its DENOUEMENT,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with\r\nsudden grimness.\r\n\r\nAgain she was disconcerted by the abrupt change in his tone, and\r\nas in one flash she saw the peril of the moment, and the need of\r\nkeeping her sense of it out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDENOUEMENT\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that too big a word for such a small incident?\r\nThe worst of it, after all, is the fatigue which Bertha has\r\nprobably slept off by this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clung to the note bravely, though its futility was now plain to\r\nher in the glare of his miserable eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, with the hurt cry of a child; and\r\nwhile she tried to merge her sympathy, and her resolve to ignore\r\nany cause for it, in one ambiguous murmur of deprecation, he\r\ndropped down on the bench near which they had paused, and poured\r\nout the wretchedness of his soul.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful hour\xe2\x80\x94an hour from which she emerged shrinking\r\nand seared, as though her lids had been scorched by its actual\r\nglare. It was not that she had never had premonitory glimpses of\r\nsuch an outbreak; but rather because, here and there throughout\r\nthe three months, the surface of life had shown such ominous\r\ncracks and vapours that her fears had always been on the alert\r\nfor an upheaval. There had been moments when the situation had\r\npresented itself under a homelier yet more vivid image\xe2\x80\x94that of a\r\nshaky vehicle, dashed by unbroken steeds over a bumping road, while\r\nshe cowered within, aware that the harness wanted mending, and\r\nwondering what would give way first. Well\xe2\x80\x94everything had given way\r\nnow; and the wonder was that the crazy outfit had held together so\r\nlong. Her sense of being involved in the crash, instead of merely\r\nwitnessing it from the road, was intensified by the way in which\r\nDorset, through his furies of denunciation and wild reactions of\r\nself-contempt, made her feel the need he had of her, the place she\r\nhad taken in his life. But for her, what ear would have been open\r\nto his cries? And what hand but hers could drag him up again to a\r\nfooting of sanity and self-respect? All through the stress of the\r\nstruggle with him, she had been conscious of something faintly\r\nmaternal in her efforts to guide and uplift him. But for the\r\npresent, if he clung to her, it was not in order to be dragged up,\r\nbut to feel some one floundering in the depths with him: he wanted\r\nher to suffer with him, not to help him to suffer less.\r\n\r\nHappily for both, there was little physical strength to sustain his\r\nfrenzy. It left him, collapsed and breathing heavily, to an apathy\r\nso deep and prolonged that Lily almost feared the passers-by would\r\nthink it the result of a seizure, and stop to offer their aid. But\r\nMonte Carlo is, of all places, the one where the human bond is\r\nleast close, and odd sights are the least arresting. If a glance\r\nor two lingered on the couple, no intrusive sympathy disturbed\r\nthem; and it was Lily herself who broke the silence by rising from\r\nher seat. With the clearing of her vision the sweep of peril had\r\nextended, and she saw that the post of danger was no longer at\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t go back, I must\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t make me leave you!\xe2\x80\x9d she urged.\r\n\r\nBut he remained mutely resistant, and she added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\ngoing to do? You really can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can go to an hotel. I can telegraph my lawyers.\xe2\x80\x9d He sat up,\r\nroused by a new thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove, Selden\xe2\x80\x99s at Nice\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for\r\nSelden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily, at this, reseated herself with a cry of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, NO!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe protested.\r\n\r\nHe swung round on her distrustfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not Selden? He\xe2\x80\x99s a lawyer\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t he? One will do as well as another in a case like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs badly as another, you mean. I thought you relied on ME to help\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do\xe2\x80\x94by being so sweet and patient with me. If it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nfor you I\xe2\x80\x99d have ended the thing long ago. But now it\xe2\x80\x99s got to\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d He rose suddenly, straightening himself with an effort. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t want to see me ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at him kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npondering, almost to her own surprise she broke out with a flash of\r\ninspiration: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, go over and see Mr. Selden. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to\r\ndo it before dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, DINNER\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he mocked her; but she left him with the smiling\r\nrejoinder: \xe2\x80\x9cDinner on board, remember; we\xe2\x80\x99ll put it off till nine\r\nif you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was past four already; and when a cab had dropped her at the\r\nquay, and she stood waiting for the gig to put off for her,\r\nshe began to wonder what had been happening on the yacht. Of\r\nSilverton\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts there had been no mention. Had he returned\r\nto the Sabrina? Or could Bertha\xe2\x80\x94the dread alternative sprang on\r\nher suddenly\xe2\x80\x94could Bertha, left to herself, have gone ashore to\r\nrejoin him? Lily\xe2\x80\x99s heart stood still at the thought. All her\r\nconcern had hitherto been for young Silverton, not only because,\r\nin such affairs, the woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct is to side with the man, but\r\nbecause his case made a peculiar appeal to her sympathies. He was\r\nso desperately in earnest, poor youth, and his earnestness was of\r\nso different a quality from Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s, though hers too was desperate\r\nenough. The difference was that Bertha was in earnest only about\r\nherself, while he was in earnest about her. But now, at the actual\r\ncrisis, this difference seemed to throw the weight of destitution\r\non Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s side, since at least he had her to suffer for, and\r\nshe had only herself. At any rate, viewed less ideally, all the\r\ndisadvantages of such a situation were for the woman; and it was\r\nto Bertha that Lily\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies now went out. She was not fond of\r\nBertha Dorset, but neither was she without a sense of obligation,\r\nthe heavier for having so little personal liking to sustain it.\r\nBertha had been kind to her, they had lived together, during the\r\nlast months, on terms of easy friendship, and the sense of friction\r\nof which Lily had recently become aware seemed to make it the more\r\nurgent that she should work undividedly in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\r\n\r\nIt was in Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s interest, certainly, that she had despatched\r\nDorset to consult with Lawrence Selden. Once the grotesqueness\r\nof the situation accepted, she had seen at a glance that it was\r\nthe safest in which Dorset could find himself. Who but Selden\r\ncould thus miraculously combine the skill to save Bertha with the\r\nobligation of doing so? The consciousness that much skill would\r\nbe required made Lily rest thankfully in the greatness of the\r\nobligation. Since he would HAVE to pull Bertha through she could\r\ntrust him to find a way; and she put the fulness of her trust in\r\nthe telegram she managed to send him on her way to the quay.\r\n\r\nThus far, then, Lily felt that she had done well; and the\r\nconviction strengthened her for the task that remained. She and\r\nBertha had never been on confidential terms, but at such a crisis\r\nthe barriers of reserve must surely fall: Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s wild allusions\r\nto the scene of the morning made Lily feel that they were down\r\nalready, and that any attempt to rebuild them would be beyond\r\nBertha\xe2\x80\x99s strength. She pictured the poor creature shivering behind\r\nher fallen defences and awaiting with suspense the moment when\r\nshe could take refuge in the first shelter that offered. If only\r\nthat shelter had not already offered itself elsewhere! As the gig\r\ntraversed the short distance between the quay and the yacht, Lily\r\ngrew more than ever alarmed at the possible consequences of her\r\nlong absence. What if the wretched Bertha, finding in all the long\r\nhours no soul to turn to\xe2\x80\x94but by this time Lily\xe2\x80\x99s eager foot was on\r\nthe side-ladder, and her first step on the Sabrina showed the worst\r\nof her apprehensions to be unfounded; for there, in the luxurious\r\nshade of the after-deck, the wretched Bertha, in full command of\r\nher usual attenuated elegance, sat dispensing tea to the Duchess of\r\nBeltshire and Lord Hubert.\r\n\r\nThe sight filled Lily with such surprise that she felt that\r\nBertha, at least, must read its meaning in her look, and she was\r\nproportionately disconcerted by the blankness of the look returned.\r\nBut in an instant she saw that Mrs. Dorset had, of necessity, to\r\nlook blank before the others, and that, to mitigate the effect\r\nof her own surprise, she must at once produce some simple reason\r\nfor it. The long habit of rapid transitions made it easy for her\r\nto exclaim to the Duchess: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought you\xe2\x80\x99d gone back to the\r\nPrincess!\xe2\x80\x9d and this sufficed for the lady she addressed, if it was\r\nhardly enough for Lord Hubert.\r\n\r\nAt least it opened the way to a lively explanation of how the\r\nDuchess was, in fact, going back the next moment, but had first\r\nrushed out to the yacht for a word with Mrs. Dorset on the subject\r\nof tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s dinner\xe2\x80\x94the dinner with the Brys, to which Lord Hubert\r\nhad finally insisted on dragging them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo save my neck, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, with a glance that\r\nappealed to Lily for some recognition of his promptness; and the\r\nDuchess added, with her noble candour: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bry has promised him a\r\ntip, and he says if we go he\xe2\x80\x99ll pass it onto us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis led to some final pleasantries, in which, as it seemed to\r\nLily, Mrs. Dorset bore her part with astounding bravery, and at the\r\nclose of which Lord Hubert, from half way down the side-ladder,\r\ncalled back, with an air of numbering heads: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course we may\r\ncount on Dorset too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, count on him,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife assented gaily. She was keeping up\r\nwell to the last\xe2\x80\x94but as she turned back from waving her adieux over\r\nthe side, Lily said to herself that the mask must drop and the soul\r\nof fear look out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorset turned back slowly; perhaps she wanted time to steady\r\nher muscles; at any rate, they were still under perfect control\r\nwhen, dropping once more into her seat behind the tea-table, she\r\nremarked to Miss Bart with a faint touch of irony: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I\r\nought to say good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf it was a cue, Lily was ready to take it, though with only\r\nthe vaguest sense of what was expected of her in return. There\r\nwas something unnerving in the contemplation of Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomposure, and she had to force the light tone in which she\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to see you this morning, but you were not yet\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I got to bed late. After we missed you at the station I thought\r\nwe ought to wait for you till the last train.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke very\r\ngently, but with just the least tinge of reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou missed us? You waited for us at the station?\xe2\x80\x9d Now indeed Lily\r\nwas too far adrift in bewilderment to measure the other\xe2\x80\x99s words or\r\nkeep watch on her own. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to the station\r\ntill after the last train had left!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorset, examining her between lowered lids, met this with the\r\nimmediate query: \xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge\xe2\x80\x94I saw him just now in the gardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, is that George\xe2\x80\x99s version? Poor George\xe2\x80\x94he was in no state to\r\nremember what I told him. He had one of his worst attacks this\r\nmorning, and I packed him off to see the doctor. Do you know if he\r\nfound him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily, still lost in conjecture, made no reply, and Mrs. Dorset\r\nsettled herself indolently in her seat. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll wait to see him; he\r\nwas horribly frightened about himself. It\xe2\x80\x99s very bad for him to be\r\nworried, and whenever anything upsetting happens, it always brings\r\non an attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Lily felt sure that a cue was being pressed on her;\r\nbut it was put forth with such startling suddenness, and with so\r\nincredible an air of ignoring what it led up to, that she could\r\nonly falter out doubtfully: \xe2\x80\x9cAnything upsetting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94such as having you so conspicuously on his hands in the small\r\nhours. You know, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re rather a big responsibility in\r\nsuch a scandalous place after midnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that\xe2\x80\x94at the complete unexpectedness and the inconceivable\r\naudacity of it\xe2\x80\x94Lily could not restrain the tribute of an astonished\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really\xe2\x80\x94considering it was you who burdened him with the\r\nresponsibility!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorset took this with an exquisite mildness. \xe2\x80\x9cBy not having\r\nthe superhuman cleverness to discover you in that frightful rush\r\nfor the train? Or the imagination to believe that you\xe2\x80\x99d take it\r\nwithout us\xe2\x80\x94you and he all alone\xe2\x80\x94instead of waiting quietly in the\r\nstation till we DID manage to meet you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s colour rose: it was growing clear to her that Bertha was\r\npursuing an object, following a line she had marked out for\r\nherself. Only, with such a doom impending, why waste time in these\r\nchildish efforts to avert it? The puerility of the attempt disarmed\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s indignation: did it not prove how horribly the poor creature\r\nwas frightened?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; by our simply all keeping together at Nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeeping together? When it was you who seized the first opportunity\r\nto rush off with the Duchess and her friends? My dear Lily, you are\r\nnot a child to be led by the hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94nor to be lectured, Bertha, really; if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you are\r\ndoing to me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Dorset smiled on her reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cLecture you\xe2\x80\x94I? Heaven\r\nforbid! I was merely trying to give you a friendly hint. But it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nusually the other way round, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99m expected to take hints,\r\nnot to give them: I\xe2\x80\x99ve positively lived on them all these last\r\nmonths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHints\xe2\x80\x94from me to you?\xe2\x80\x9d Lily repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, negative ones merely\xe2\x80\x94what not to be and to do and to see. And\r\nI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken them to admiration. Only, my dear, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let\r\nme say so, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand that one of my negative duties was\r\nNOT to warn you when you carried your imprudence too far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA chill of fear passed over Miss Bart: a sense of remembered\r\ntreachery that was like the gleam of a knife in the dusk. But\r\ncompassion, in a moment, got the better of her instinctive\r\nrecoil. What was this outpouring of senseless bitterness but the\r\ntracked creature\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to cloud the medium through which it\r\nwas fleeing? It was on Lily\xe2\x80\x99s lips to exclaim: \xe2\x80\x9cYou poor soul,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t double and turn\xe2\x80\x94come straight back to me, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll find a\r\nway out!\xe2\x80\x9d But the words died under the impenetrable insolence of\r\nBertha\xe2\x80\x99s smile. Lily sat silent, taking the brunt of it quietly,\r\nletting it spend itself on her to the last drop of its accumulated\r\nfalseness; then, without a word, she rose and went down to her\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s telegram caught Lawrence Selden at the door of his\r\nhotel; and having read it, he turned back to wait for Dorset. The\r\nmessage necessarily left large gaps for conjecture; but all that he\r\nhad recently heard and seen made these but too easy to fill in. On\r\nthe whole he was surprised; for though he had perceived that the\r\nsituation contained all the elements of an explosion, he had often\r\nenough, in the range of his personal experience, seen just such\r\ncombinations subside into harmlessness. Still, Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s spasmodic\r\ntemper, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s reckless disregard of appearances, gave the\r\nsituation a peculiar insecurity; and it was less from the sense of\r\nany special relation to the case than from a purely professional\r\nzeal, that Selden resolved to guide the pair to safety. Whether, in\r\nthe present instance, safety for either lay in repairing so damaged\r\na tie, it was no business of his to consider: he had only, on\r\ngeneral principles, to think of averting a scandal, and his desire\r\nto avert it was increased by his fear of its involving Miss Bart.\r\nThere was nothing specific in this apprehension; he merely wished\r\nto spare her the embarrassment of being ever so remotely connected\r\nwith the public washing of the Dorset linen.\r\n\r\nHow exhaustive and unpleasant such a process would be, he saw\r\neven more vividly after his two hours\xe2\x80\x99 talk with poor Dorset. If\r\nanything came out at all, it would be such a vast unpacking of\r\naccumulated moral rags as left him, after his visitor had gone,\r\nwith the feeling that he must fling open the windows and have his\r\nroom swept out. But nothing should come out; and happily for his\r\nside of the case, the dirty rags, however pieced together, could\r\nnot, without considerable difficulty, be turned into a homogeneous\r\ngrievance. The torn edges did not always fit\xe2\x80\x94there were missing\r\nbits, there were disparities of size and colour, all of which it\r\nwas naturally Selden\xe2\x80\x99s business to make the most of in putting\r\nthem under his client\xe2\x80\x99s eye. But to a man in Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s mood the\r\ncompletest demonstration could not carry conviction, and Selden saw\r\nthat for the moment all he could do was to soothe and temporize,\r\nto offer sympathy and to counsel prudence. He let Dorset depart\r\ncharged to the brim with the sense that, till their next meeting,\r\nhe must maintain a strictly noncommittal attitude; that, in short,\r\nhis share in the game consisted for the present in looking on.\r\nSelden knew, however, that he could not long keep such violences\r\nin equilibrium; and he promised to meet Dorset, the next morning,\r\nat an hotel in Monte Carlo. Meanwhile he counted not a little on\r\nthe reaction of weakness and self-distrust that, in such natures,\r\nfollows on every unwonted expenditure of moral force; and his\r\ntelegraphic reply to Miss Bart consisted simply in the injunction:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssume that everything is as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this assumption, in fact, the early part of the following day\r\nwas lived through. Dorset, as if in obedience to Lily\xe2\x80\x99s imperative\r\nbidding, had actually returned in time for a late dinner on the\r\nyacht. The repast had been the most difficult moment of the day.\r\nDorset was sunk in one of the abysmal silences which so commonly\r\nfollowed on what his wife called his \xe2\x80\x9cattacks\xe2\x80\x9d that it was easy,\r\nbefore the servants, to refer it to this cause; but Bertha herself\r\nseemed, perversely enough, little disposed to make use of this\r\nobvious means of protection. She simply left the brunt of the\r\nsituation on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s hands, as if too absorbed in a grievance\r\nof her own to suspect that she might be the object of one herself.\r\nTo Lily this attitude was the most ominous, because the most\r\nperplexing, element in the situation. As she tried to fan the\r\nweak flicker of talk, to build up, again and again, the crumbling\r\nstructure of \xe2\x80\x9cappearances,\xe2\x80\x9d her own attention was perpetually\r\ndistracted by the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth can she be driving at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere was something positively exasperating in Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s attitude\r\nof isolated defiance. If only she would have given her friend a\r\nhint they might still have worked together successfully; but how\r\ncould Lily be of use, while she was thus obstinately shut out from\r\nparticipation? To be of use was what she honestly wanted; and not\r\nfor her own sake but for the Dorsets\xe2\x80\x99. She had not thought of her\r\nown situation at all: she was simply engrossed in trying to put a\r\nlittle order in theirs. But the close of the short dreary evening\r\nleft her with a sense of effort hopelessly wasted. She had not\r\ntried to see Dorset alone: she had positively shrunk from a renewal\r\nof his confidences. It was Bertha whose confidence she sought, and\r\nwho should as eagerly have invited her own; and Bertha, as if in\r\nthe infatuation of self-destruction, was actually pushing away her\r\nrescuing hand.\r\n\r\nLily, going to bed early, had left the couple to themselves; and\r\nit seemed part of the general mystery in which she moved that\r\nmore than an hour should elapse before she heard Bertha walk down\r\nthe silent passage and regain her room. The morrow, rising on an\r\napparent continuance of the same conditions, revealed nothing of\r\nwhat had occurred between the confronted pair. One fact alone\r\noutwardly proclaimed the change they were all conspiring to\r\nignore; and that was the non-appearance of Ned Silverton. No one\r\nreferred to it, and this tacit avoidance of the subject kept\r\nit in the immediate foreground of consciousness. But there was\r\nanother change, perceptible only to Lily; and that was that Dorset\r\nnow avoided her almost as pointedly as his wife. Perhaps he was\r\nrepenting his rash outpourings of the previous day; perhaps only\r\ntrying, in his clumsy way, to conform to Selden\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to behave\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas usual.\xe2\x80\x9d Such instructions no more make for easiness of attitude\r\nthan the photographer\xe2\x80\x99s behest to \xe2\x80\x9clook natural\xe2\x80\x9d; and in a creature\r\nas unconscious as poor Dorset of the appearance he habitually\r\npresented, the struggle to maintain a pose was sure to result in\r\nqueer contortions.\r\n\r\nIt resulted, at any rate, in throwing Lily strangely on her own\r\nresources. She had learned, on leaving her room, that Mrs. Dorset\r\nwas still invisible, and that Dorset had left the yacht early; and\r\nfeeling too restless to remain alone, she too had herself ferried\r\nashore. Straying toward the Casino, she attached herself to a\r\ngroup of acquaintances from Nice, with whom she lunched, and in\r\nwhose company she was returning to the rooms when she encountered\r\nSelden crossing the square. She could not, at the moment, separate\r\nherself definitely from her party, who had hospitably assumed that\r\nshe would remain with them till they took their departure; but she\r\nfound time for a momentary pause of enquiry, to which he promptly\r\nreturned: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him again\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s just left me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited before him anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cWell? what has happened? What\r\nWILL happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing as yet\xe2\x80\x94and nothing in the future, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s over, then? It\xe2\x80\x99s settled? You\xe2\x80\x99re sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me time. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m a good deal surer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd with that she had to content herself, and hasten on to the\r\nexpectant group on the steps.\r\n\r\nSelden had in fact given her the utmost measure of his sureness,\r\nhad even stretched it a shade to meet the anxiety in her eyes. And\r\nnow, as he turned away, strolling down the hill toward the station,\r\nthat anxiety remained with him as the visible justification of\r\nhis own. It was not, indeed, anything specific that he feared:\r\nthere had been a literal truth in his declaration that he did not\r\nthink anything would happen. What troubled him was that, though\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s attitude had perceptibly changed, the change was not\r\nclearly to be accounted for. It had certainly not been produced by\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, or by the action of his own soberer reason.\r\nFive minutes\xe2\x80\x99 talk sufficed to show that some alien influence had\r\nbeen at work, and that it had not so much subdued his resentment\r\nas weakened his will, so that he moved under it in a state of\r\napathy, like a dangerous lunatic who has been drugged. Temporarily,\r\nno doubt, however exerted, it worked for the general safety: the\r\nquestion was how long it would last, and by what kind of reaction\r\nit was likely to be followed. On these points Selden could gain no\r\nlight; for he saw that one effect of the transformation had been to\r\nshut him off from free communion with Dorset. The latter, indeed,\r\nwas still moved by the irresistible desire to discuss his wrong;\r\nbut, though he revolved about it with the same forlorn tenacity,\r\nSelden was aware that something always restrained him from full\r\nexpression. His state was one to produce first weariness and then\r\nimpatience in his hearer; and when their talk was over, Selden\r\nbegan to feel that he had done his utmost, and might justifiably\r\nwash his hands of the sequel.\r\n\r\nIt was in this mind that he had been making his way back to the\r\nstation when Miss Bart crossed his path; but though, after his\r\nbrief word with her, he kept mechanically on his course, he was\r\nconscious of a gradual change in his purpose. The change had been\r\nproduced by the look in her eyes; and in his eagerness to define\r\nthe nature of that look, he dropped into a seat in the gardens,\r\nand sat brooding upon the question. It was natural enough, in\r\nall conscience, that she should appear anxious: a young woman\r\nplaced, in the close intimacy of a yachting-cruise, between a\r\ncouple on the verge of disaster, could hardly, aside from her\r\nconcern for her friends, be insensible to the awkwardness of her\r\nown position. The worst of it was that, in interpreting Miss\r\nBart\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, so many alternative readings were possible;\r\nand one of these, in Selden\xe2\x80\x99s troubled mind, took the ugly form\r\nsuggested by Mrs. Fisher. If the girl was afraid, was she afraid\r\nfor herself or for her friends? And to what degree was her dread of\r\na catastrophe intensified by the sense of being fatally involved\r\nin it? The burden of offence lying manifestly with Mrs. Dorset,\r\nthis conjecture seemed on the face of it gratuitously unkind; but\r\nSelden knew that in the most one-sided matrimonial quarrel there\r\nare generally counter-charges to be brought, and that they are\r\nbrought with the greater audacity where the original grievance\r\nis so emphatic. Mrs. Fisher had not hesitated to suggest the\r\nlikelihood of Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s marrying Miss Bart if \xe2\x80\x9canything happened\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand though Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions were notoriously rash, she\r\nwas shrewd enough in reading the signs from which they were drawn.\r\nDorset had apparently shown marked interest in the girl, and this\r\ninterest might be used to cruel advantage in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s struggle\r\nfor rehabilitation. Selden knew that Bertha would fight to the\r\nlast round of powder: the rashness of her conduct was illogically\r\ncombined with a cold determination to escape its consequences.\r\nShe could be as unscrupulous in fighting for herself as she was\r\nreckless in courting danger, and whatever came to her hand at such\r\nmoments was likely to be used as a defensive missile. He did not,\r\nas yet, see clearly just what course she was likely to take, but\r\nhis perplexity increased his apprehension, and with it the sense\r\nthat, before leaving, he must speak again with Miss Bart. Whatever\r\nher share in the situation\xe2\x80\x94and he had always honestly tried to\r\nresist judging her by her surroundings\xe2\x80\x94however free she might be\r\nfrom any personal connection with it, she would be better out of\r\nthe way of a possible crash; and since she had appealed to him for\r\nhelp, it was clearly his business to tell her so.\r\n\r\nThis decision at last brought him to his feet, and carried him\r\nback to the gambling rooms, within whose doors he had seen her\r\ndisappearing; but a prolonged exploration of the crowd failed\r\nto put him on her traces. He saw instead, to his surprise, Ned\r\nSilverton loitering somewhat ostentatiously about the tables; and\r\nthe discovery that this actor in the drama was not only hovering in\r\nthe wings, but actually inviting the exposure of the footlights,\r\nthough it might have seemed to imply that all peril was over,\r\nserved rather to deepen Selden\xe2\x80\x99s sense of foreboding. Charged with\r\nthis impression he returned to the square, hoping to see Miss Bart\r\nmove across it, as every one in Monte Carlo seemed inevitably to do\r\nat least a dozen times a day; but here again he waited vainly for\r\na glimpse of her, and the conclusion was slowly forced on him that\r\nshe had gone back to the Sabrina. It would be difficult to follow\r\nher there, and still more difficult, should he do so, to contrive\r\nthe opportunity for a private word; and he had almost decided on\r\nthe unsatisfactory alternative of writing, when the ceaseless\r\ndiorama of the square suddenly unrolled before him the figures of\r\nLord Hubert and Mrs. Bry.\r\n\r\nHailing them at once with his question, he learned from Lord\r\nHubert that Miss Bart had just returned to the Sabrina in Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompany; an announcement so evidently disconcerting to him that\r\nMrs. Bry, after a glance from her companion, which seemed to act\r\nlike the pressure on a spring, brought forth the prompt proposal\r\nthat he should come and meet his friends at dinner that evening\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\nBecassin\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a little dinner to the Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d she flashed out before\r\nLord Hubert had time to remove the pressure.\r\n\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s sense of the privilege of being included in such company\r\nbrought him early in the evening to the door of the restaurant,\r\nwhere he paused to scan the ranks of diners approaching down the\r\nbrightly lit terrace. There, while the Brys hovered within over\r\nthe last agitating alternatives of the MENU, he kept watch for\r\nthe guests from the Sabrina, who at length rose on the horizon in\r\ncompany with the Duchess, Lord and Lady Skiddaw and the Stepneys.\r\nFrom this group it was easy for him to detach Miss Bart on the\r\npretext of a moment\xe2\x80\x99s glance into one of the brilliant shops along\r\nthe terrace, and to say to her, while they lingered together in the\r\nwhite dazzle of a jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s window: \xe2\x80\x9cI stopped over to see you\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nbeg of you to leave the yacht.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes she turned on him showed a quick gleam of her former fear.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo leave\xe2\x80\x94? What do you mean? What has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. But if anything should, why be in the way of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe glare from the jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s window, deepening the pallor of her\r\nface, gave to its delicate lines the sharpness of a tragic mask.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will, I am sure; but while there\xe2\x80\x99s even a doubt left, how\r\ncan you think I would leave Bertha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words rang out on a note of contempt\xe2\x80\x94was it possibly of\r\ncontempt for himself? Well, he was willing to risk its renewal\r\nto the extent of insisting, with an undeniable throb of added\r\ninterest: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have yourself to think of, you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d to which, with\r\na strange fall of sadness in her voice, she answered, meeting his\r\neyes: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew how little difference that makes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, nothing WILL happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, more for his own\r\nreassurance than for hers; and \xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nvaliantly assented, as they turned to overtake their companions.\r\n\r\nIn the thronged restaurant, taking their places about Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nilluminated board, their confidence seemed to gain support from\r\nthe familiarity of their surroundings. Here were Dorset and his\r\nwife once more presenting their customary faces to the world, she\r\nengrossed in establishing her relation with an intensely new gown,\r\nhe shrinking with dyspeptic dread from the multiplied solicitations\r\nof the MENU. The mere fact that they thus showed themselves\r\ntogether, with the utmost openness the place afforded, seemed\r\nto declare beyond a doubt that their differences were composed.\r\nHow this end had been attained was still matter for wonder, but\r\nit was clear that for the moment Miss Bart rested confidently in\r\nthe result; and Selden tried to achieve the same view by telling\r\nhimself that her opportunities for observation had been ampler than\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the dinner advanced through a labyrinth of courses,\r\nin which it became clear that Mrs. Bry had occasionally broken away\r\nfrom Lord Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s restraining hand, Selden\xe2\x80\x99s general watchfulness\r\nbegan to lose itself in a particular study of Miss Bart. It was\r\none of the days when she was so handsome that to be handsome was\r\nenough, and all the rest\xe2\x80\x94her grace, her quickness, her social\r\nfelicities\xe2\x80\x94seemed the overflow of a bounteous nature. But what\r\nespecially struck him was the way in which she detached herself, by\r\na hundred undefinable shades, from the persons who most abounded\r\nin her own style. It was in just such company, the fine flower\r\nand complete expression of the state she aspired to, that the\r\ndifferences came out with special poignancy, her grace cheapening\r\nthe other women\xe2\x80\x99s smartness as her finely-discriminated silences\r\nmade their chatter dull. The strain of the last hours had restored\r\nto her face the deeper eloquence which Selden had lately missed\r\nin it, and the bravery of her words to him still fluttered in her\r\nvoice and eyes. Yes, she was matchless\xe2\x80\x94it was the one word for\r\nher; and he could give his admiration the freer play because so\r\nlittle personal feeling remained in it. His real detachment from\r\nher had taken place, not at the lurid moment of disenchantment,\r\nbut now, in the sober after-light of discrimination, where he saw\r\nher definitely divided from him by the crudeness of a choice which\r\nseemed to deny the very differences he felt in her. It was before\r\nhim again in its completeness\xe2\x80\x94the choice in which she was content\r\nto rest: in the stupid costliness of the food and the showy dulness\r\nof the talk, in the freedom of speech which never arrived at wit\r\nand the freedom of act which never made for romance. The strident\r\nsetting of the restaurant, in which their table seemed set apart\r\nin a special glare of publicity, and the presence at it of little\r\nDabham of the \xe2\x80\x9cRiviera Notes,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasized the ideals of a world\r\nwhere conspicuousness passed for distinction, and the society\r\ncolumn had become the roll of fame.\r\n\r\nIt was as the immortalizer of such occasions that little Dabham,\r\nwedged in modest watchfulness between two brilliant neighbours,\r\nsuddenly became the centre of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s scrutiny. How much did he\r\nknow of what was going on, and how much, for his purpose, was still\r\nworth finding out? His little eyes were like tentacles thrown\r\nout to catch the floating intimations with which, to Selden, the\r\nair at moments seemed thick; then again it cleared to its normal\r\nemptiness, and he could see nothing in it for the journalist\r\nbut leisure to note the elegance of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 gowns. Mrs.\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s, in particular, challenged all the wealth of Mr. Dabham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvocabulary: it had surprises and subtleties worthy of what he\r\nwould have called \xe2\x80\x9cthe literary style.\xe2\x80\x9d At first, as Selden had\r\nnoticed, it had been almost too preoccupying to its wearer; but now\r\nshe was in full command of it, and was even producing her effects\r\nwith unwonted freedom. Was she not, indeed, too free, too fluent,\r\nfor perfect naturalness? And was not Dorset, to whom his glance\r\nhad passed by a natural transition, too jerkily wavering between\r\nthe same extremes? Dorset indeed was always jerky; but it seemed\r\nto Selden that tonight each vibration swung him farther from his\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nThe dinner, meanwhile, was moving to its triumphant close, to\r\nthe evident satisfaction of Mrs. Bry, who, throned in apoplectic\r\nmajesty between Lord Skiddaw and Lord Hubert, seemed in spirit to\r\nbe calling on Mrs. Fisher to witness her achievement. Short of\r\nMrs. Fisher her audience might have been called complete; for the\r\nrestaurant was crowded with persons mainly gathered there for the\r\npurpose of spectatorship, and accurately posted as to the names and\r\nfaces of the celebrities they had come to see. Mrs. Bry, conscious\r\nthat all her feminine guests came under that heading, and that\r\neach one looked her part to admiration, shone on Lily with all the\r\npent-up gratitude that Mrs. Fisher had failed to deserve. Selden,\r\ncatching the glance, wondered what part Miss Bart had played in\r\norganizing the entertainment. She did, at least, a great deal to\r\nadorn it; and as he watched the bright security with which she bore\r\nherself, he smiled to think that he should have fancied her in\r\nneed of help. Never had she appeared more serenely mistress of the\r\nsituation than when, at the moment of dispersal, detaching herself\r\na little from the group about the table, she turned with a smile\r\nand a graceful slant of the shoulders to receive her cloak from\r\nDorset.\r\n\r\nThe dinner had been protracted over Mr. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s exceptional cigars\r\nand a bewildering array of liqueurs, and many of the other tables\r\nwere empty; but a sufficient number of diners still lingered to\r\ngive relief to the leave-taking of Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s distinguished guests.\r\nThis ceremony was drawn out and complicated by the fact that it\r\ninvolved, on the part of the Duchess and Lady Skiddaw, definite\r\nfarewells, and pledges of speedy reunion in Paris, where they were\r\nto pause and replenish their wardrobes on the way to England. The\r\nquality of Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality, and of the tips her husband\r\nhad presumably imparted, lent to the manner of the English ladies\r\na general effusiveness which shed the rosiest light over their\r\nhostess\xe2\x80\x99s future. In its glow Mrs. Dorset and the Stepneys were\r\nalso visibly included, and the whole scene had touches of intimacy\r\nworth their weight in gold to the watchful pen of Mr. Dabham.\r\n\r\nA glance at her watch caused the Duchess to exclaim to her sister\r\nthat they had just time to dash for their train, and the flurry\r\nof this departure over, the Stepneys, who had their motor at the\r\ndoor, offered to convey the Dorsets and Miss Bart to the quay. The\r\noffer was accepted, and Mrs. Dorset moved away with her husband\r\nin attendance. Miss Bart had lingered for a last word with Lord\r\nHubert, and Stepney, on whom Mr. Bry was pressing a final, and\r\nstill more expensive, cigar, called out: \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Lily, if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing back to the yacht.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily turned to obey; but as she did so, Mrs. Dorset, who had paused\r\non her way out, moved a few steps back toward the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart is not going back to the yacht,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a voice of\r\nsingular distinctness.\r\n\r\nA startled look ran from eye to eye; Mrs. Bry crimsoned to the\r\nverge of congestion, Mrs. Stepney slipped nervously behind her\r\nhusband, and Selden, in the general turmoil of his sensations, was\r\nmainly conscious of a longing to grip Dabham by the collar and\r\nfling him out into the street.\r\n\r\nDorset, meanwhile, had stepped back to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s side. His\r\nface was white, and he looked about him with cowed angry eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBertha!\xe2\x80\x94Miss Bart . . . this is some misunderstanding . . . some\r\nmistake....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart remains here,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife rejoined incisively. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, I\r\nthink, George, we had better not detain Mrs. Stepney any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart, during this brief exchange of words, remained in\r\nadmirable erectness, slightly isolated from the embarrassed group\r\nabout her. She had paled a little under the shock of the insult,\r\nbut the discomposure of the surrounding faces was not reflected in\r\nher own. The faint disdain of her smile seemed to lift her high\r\nabove her antagonist\xe2\x80\x99s reach, and it was not till she had given\r\nMrs. Dorset the full measure of the distance between them that she\r\nturned and extended her hand to her hostess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am joining the Duchess tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cand it seemed\r\neasier for me to remain on shore for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held firmly to Mrs. Bry\xe2\x80\x99s wavering eye while she gave this\r\nexplanation, but when it was over Selden saw her send a tentative\r\nglance from one to another of the women\xe2\x80\x99s faces. She read their\r\nincredulity in their averted looks, and in the mute wretchedness\r\nof the men behind them, and for a miserable half-second he thought\r\nshe quivered on the brink of failure. Then, turning to him with an\r\neasy gesture, and the pale bravery of her recovered smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr.\r\nSelden,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou promised to see me to my cab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside, the sky was gusty and overcast, and as Lily and Selden\r\nmoved toward the deserted gardens below the restaurant, spurts of\r\nwarm rain blew fitfully against their faces. The fiction of the cab\r\nhad been tacitly abandoned; they walked on in silence, her hand on\r\nhis arm, till the deeper shade of the gardens received them, and\r\npausing beside a bench, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cSit down a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped to the seat without answering, but the electric lamp at\r\nthe bend of the path shed a gleam on the struggling misery of her\r\nface. Selden sat down beside her, waiting for her to speak, fearful\r\nlest any word he chose should touch too roughly on her wound, and\r\nkept also from free utterance by the wretched doubt which had\r\nslowly renewed itself within him. What had brought her to this\r\npass? What weakness had placed her so abominably at her enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmercy? And why should Bertha Dorset have turned into an enemy at\r\nthe very moment when she so obviously needed the support of her\r\nsex? Even while his nerves raged at the subjection of husbands to\r\ntheir wives, and at the cruelty of women to their kind, reason\r\nobstinately harped on the proverbial relation between smoke and\r\nfire. The memory of Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s hints, and the corroboration of\r\nhis own impressions, while they deepened his pity also increased\r\nhis constraint, since, whichever way he sought a free outlet for\r\nsympathy, it was blocked by the fear of committing a blunder.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it struck him that his silence must seem almost as\r\naccusatory as that of the men he had despised for turning from her;\r\nbut before he could find the fitting word she had cut him short\r\nwith a question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know of a quiet hotel? I can send for my maid in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn hotel\xe2\x80\x94HERE\xe2\x80\x94that you can go to alone? It\xe2\x80\x99s not possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met this with a pale gleam of her old playfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat IS,\r\nthen? It\xe2\x80\x99s too wet to sleep in the gardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there must be some one\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one to whom I can go? Of course\xe2\x80\x94any number\xe2\x80\x94but at THIS hour?\r\nYou see my change of plan was rather sudden\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99d listened to me!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, venting his\r\nhelplessness in a burst of anger.\r\n\r\nShe still held him off with the gentle mockery of her smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cYou advised me to leave the yacht, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m leaving it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe saw then, with a pang of self-reproach, that she meant neither\r\nto explain nor to defend herself; that by his miserable silence he\r\nhad forfeited all chance of helping her, and that the decisive hour\r\nwas past.\r\n\r\nShe had risen, and stood before him in a kind of clouded majesty,\r\nlike some deposed princess moving tranquilly to exile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with a note of despairing appeal; but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nnot now,\xe2\x80\x9d she gently admonished him; and then, in all the sweetness\r\nof her recovered composure: \xe2\x80\x9cSince I must find shelter somewhere,\r\nand since you\xe2\x80\x99re so kindly here to help me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gathered himself up at the challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will do as I tell\r\nyou? There\xe2\x80\x99s but one thing, then; you must go straight to your\r\ncousins, the Stepneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d broke from her with a movement of instinctive resistance;\r\nbut he insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cCome\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s late, and you must appear to have gone\r\nthere directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had drawn her hand into his arm, but she held him back with a\r\nlast gesture of protest. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94not that\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nGwen: you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI MUST ask you\xe2\x80\x94you must obey me,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted, though infected at\r\nheart by her own fear.\r\n\r\nHer voice sank to a whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if she refuses?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, trust\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94trust me!\xe2\x80\x9d he could only insist in return; and yielding to his\r\ntouch, she let him lead her back in silence to the edge of the\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nIn the cab they continued to remain silent through the brief drive\r\nwhich carried them to the illuminated portals of the Stepneys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhotel. Here he left her outside, in the darkness of the raised\r\nhood, while his name was sent up to Stepney, and he paced the showy\r\nhall, awaiting the latter\xe2\x80\x99s descent. Ten minutes later the two\r\nmen passed out together between the gold-laced custodians of the\r\nthreshold; but in the vestibule Stepney drew up with a last flare\r\nof reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s understood, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he stipulated nervously, with his hand on\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s arm. \xe2\x80\x9cShe leaves tomorrow by the early train\xe2\x80\x94and my wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nasleep, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be disturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blinds of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room were drawn down against\r\nthe oppressive June sun, and in the sultry twilight the faces of\r\nher assembled relatives took on a fitting shadow of bereavement.\r\nThey were all there: Van Alstynes, Stepneys and Melsons\xe2\x80\x94even a\r\nstray Peniston or two, indicating, by a greater latitude in dress\r\nand manner, the fact of remoter relationship and more settled\r\nhopes. The Peniston side was, in fact, secure in the knowledge that\r\nthe bulk of Mr. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s property \xe2\x80\x9cwent back\xe2\x80\x9d; while the direct\r\nconnection hung suspended on the disposal of his widow\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\nfortune and on the uncertainty of its extent. Jack Stepney, in\r\nhis new character as the richest nephew, tacitly took the lead,\r\nemphasizing his importance by the deeper gloss of his mourning\r\nand the subdued authority of his manner; while his wife\xe2\x80\x99s bored\r\nattitude and frivolous gown proclaimed the heiress\xe2\x80\x99s disregard of\r\nthe insignificant interests at stake. Old Ned Van Alstyne, seated\r\nnext to her in a coat that made affliction dapper, twirled his\r\nwhite moustache to conceal the eager twitch of his lips; and Grace\r\nStepney, red-nosed and smelling of crape, whispered emotionally to\r\nMrs. Herbert Melson: \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t BEAR to see the Niagara anywhere\r\nelse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA rustle of weeds and quick turning of heads hailed the opening\r\nof the door, and Lily Bart appeared, tall and noble in her black\r\ndress, with Gerty Farish at her side. The women\xe2\x80\x99s faces, as\r\nshe paused interrogatively on the threshold, were a study in\r\nhesitation. One or two made faint motions of recognition, which\r\nmight have been subdued either by the solemnity of the scene, or by\r\nthe doubt as to how far the others meant to go; Mrs. Jack Stepney\r\ngave a careless nod, and Grace Stepney, with a sepulchral gesture,\r\nindicated a seat at her side. But Lily, ignoring the invitation, as\r\nwell as Jack Stepney\xe2\x80\x99s official attempt to direct her, moved across\r\nthe room with her smooth free gait, and seated herself in a chair\r\nwhich seemed to have been purposely placed apart from the others.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that she had faced her family since her\r\nreturn from Europe, two weeks earlier; but if she perceived any\r\nuncertainty in their welcome, it served only to add a tinge of\r\nirony to the usual composure of her bearing. The shock of dismay\r\nwith which, on the dock, she had heard from Gerty Farish of Mrs.\r\nPeniston\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death, had been mitigated, almost at once, by\r\nthe irrepressible thought that now, at last, she would be able to\r\npay her debts. She had looked forward with considerable uneasiness\r\nto her first encounter with her aunt. Mrs. Peniston had vehemently\r\nopposed her niece\xe2\x80\x99s departure with the Dorsets, and had marked\r\nher continued disapproval by not writing during Lily\xe2\x80\x99s absence.\r\nThe certainty that she had heard of the rupture with the Dorsets\r\nmade the prospect of the meeting more formidable; and how should\r\nLily have repressed a quick sense of relief at the thought that,\r\ninstead of undergoing the anticipated ordeal, she had only to\r\nenter gracefully on a long-assured inheritance? It had been, in\r\nthe consecrated phrase, \xe2\x80\x9calways understood\xe2\x80\x9d that Mrs. Peniston was\r\nto provide handsomely for her niece; and in the latter\xe2\x80\x99s mind the\r\nunderstanding had long since crystallized into fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe gets everything, of course\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what we\xe2\x80\x99re here for,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Jack Stepney remarked with careless loudness to Ned Van\r\nAlstyne; and the latter\xe2\x80\x99s deprecating murmur\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJulia was always\r\na just woman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94might have been interpreted as signifying either\r\nacquiescence or doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s only about four hundred thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Stepney\r\nrejoined with a yawn; and Grace Stepney, in the silence produced by\r\nthe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary cough, was heard to sob out: \xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind a towel missing\xe2\x80\x94I went over them with her the very day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily, oppressed by the close atmosphere, and the stifling odour\r\nof fresh mourning, felt her attention straying as Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlawyer, solemnly erect behind the Buhl table at the end of the\r\nroom, began to rattle through the preamble of the will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like being in church,\xe2\x80\x9d she reflected, wondering vaguely where\r\nGwen Stepney had got such an awful hat. Then she noticed how stout\r\nJack had grown\xe2\x80\x94he would soon be almost as plethoric as Herbert\r\nMelson, who sat a few feet off, breathing puffily as he leaned his\r\nblack-gloved hands on his stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why rich people always grow fat\xe2\x80\x94I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to worry them. If I inherit, I shall have to be\r\ncareful of my figure,\xe2\x80\x9d she mused, while the lawyer droned on\r\nthrough a labyrinth of legacies. The servants came first, then\r\na few charitable institutions, then several remoter Melsons and\r\nStepneys, who stirred consciously as their names rang out, and then\r\nsubsided into a state of impassiveness befitting the solemnity of\r\nthe occasion. Ned Van Alstyne, Jack Stepney, and a cousin or two\r\nfollowed, each coupled with the mention of a few thousands: Lily\r\nwondered that Grace Stepney was not among them. Then she heard her\r\nown name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto my niece Lily Bart ten thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and after\r\nthat the lawyer again lost himself in a coil of unintelligible\r\nperiods, from which the concluding phrase flashed out with\r\nstartling distinctness: \xe2\x80\x9cand the residue of my estate to my dear\r\ncousin and name-sake, Grace Julia Stepney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a subdued gasp of surprise, a rapid turning of heads, and\r\na surging of sable figures toward the corner in which Miss Stepney\r\nwailed out her sense of unworthiness through the crumpled ball of a\r\nblack-edged handkerchief.\r\n\r\nLily stood apart from the general movement, feeling herself for the\r\nfirst time utterly alone. No one looked at her, no one seemed aware\r\nof her presence; she was probing the very depths of insignificance.\r\nAnd under her sense of the collective indifference came the acuter\r\npang of hopes deceived. Disinherited\xe2\x80\x94she had been disinherited\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nfor Grace Stepney! She met Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s lamentable eyes, fixed on her\r\nin a despairing effort at consolation, and the look brought her to\r\nherself. There was something to be done before she left the house:\r\nto be done with all the nobility she knew how to put into such\r\ngestures. She advanced to the group about Miss Stepney, and holding\r\nout her hand said simply: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Grace, I am so glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other ladies had fallen back at her approach, and a space\r\ncreated itself about her. It widened as she turned to go, and no\r\none advanced to fill it up. She paused a moment, glancing about\r\nher, calmly taking the measure of her situation. She heard some one\r\nask a question about the date of the will; she caught a fragment\r\nof the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s answer\xe2\x80\x94something about a sudden summons, and an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cearlier instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the tide of dispersal began to drift\r\npast her; Mrs. Jack Stepney and Mrs. Herbert Melson stood on the\r\ndoorstep awaiting their motor; a sympathizing group escorted Grace\r\nStepney to the cab it was felt to be fitting she should take,\r\nthough she lived but a street or two away; and Miss Bart and Gerty\r\nfound themselves almost alone in the purple drawing-room, which\r\nmore than ever, in its stuffy dimness, resembled a well-kept family\r\nvault, in which the last corpse had just been decently deposited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, whither a hansom had carried the\r\ntwo friends, Lily dropped into a chair with a faint sound of\r\nlaughter: it struck her as a humorous coincidence that her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegacy should so nearly represent the amount of her debt to Trenor.\r\nThe need of discharging that debt had reasserted itself with\r\nincreased urgency since her return to America, and she spoke her\r\nfirst thought in saying to the anxiously hovering Gerty: \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder\r\nwhen the legacies will be paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Miss Farish could not pause over the legacies; she broke into\r\na larger indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lily, it\xe2\x80\x99s unjust; it\xe2\x80\x99s cruel\xe2\x80\x94Grace\r\nStepney must FEEL she has no right to all that money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny one who knew how to please Aunt Julia has a right to her\r\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart rejoined philosophically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she was devoted to you\xe2\x80\x94she led every one to think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty\r\nchecked herself in evident embarrassment, and Miss Bart turned to\r\nher with a direct look. \xe2\x80\x9cGerty, be honest: this will was made only\r\nsix weeks ago. She had heard of my break with the Dorsets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one heard, of course, that there had been some\r\ndisagreement\xe2\x80\x94some misunderstanding\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she hear that Bertha turned me off the yacht?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what happened, you know. She said I was trying to marry\r\nGeorge Dorset. She did it to make him think she was jealous. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat what she told Gwen Stepney?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to such horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI MUST listen to them\xe2\x80\x94I must know where I stand.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and\r\nagain sounded a faint note of derision. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice the women?\r\nThey were afraid to snub me while they thought I was going to get\r\nthe money\xe2\x80\x94afterward they scuttled off as if I had the plague.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGerty remained silent, and she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI stayed on to see\r\nwhat would happen. They took their cue from Gwen Stepney and Lulu\r\nMelson\xe2\x80\x94I saw them watching to see what Gwen would do.\xe2\x80\x94Gerty, I must\r\nknow just what is being said of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t listen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hears such things without listening.\xe2\x80\x9d She rose and laid her\r\nresolute hands on Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cGerty, are people going\r\nto cut me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour FRIENDS, Lily\xe2\x80\x94how can you think it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are one\xe2\x80\x99s friends at such a time? Who, but you, you poor\r\ntrustful darling? And heaven knows what YOU suspect me of!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nkissed Gerty with a whimsical murmur. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d never let it make any\r\ndifference\xe2\x80\x94but then you\xe2\x80\x99re fond of criminals, Gerty! How about the\r\nirreclaimable ones, though? For I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely impenitent, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up to the full height of her slender majesty,\r\ntowering like some dark angel of defiance above the troubled Gerty,\r\nwho could only falter out: \xe2\x80\x9cLily, Lily\xe2\x80\x94how can you laugh about such\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo as not to weep, perhaps. But no\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not of the tearful order. I\r\ndiscovered early that crying makes my nose red, and the knowledge\r\nhas helped me through several painful episodes.\xe2\x80\x9d She took a\r\nrestless turn about the room, and then, reseating herself, lifted\r\nthe bright mockery of her eyes to Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s anxious countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have minded, you know, if I\xe2\x80\x99d got the money\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and at\r\nMiss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s protesting \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated calmly: \xe2\x80\x9cNot a straw,\r\nmy dear; for, in the first place, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have quite dared\r\nto ignore me; and if they had, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mattered, because\r\nI should have been independent of them. But now\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d The irony faded\r\nfrom her eyes, and she bent a clouded face upon her friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you talk so, Lily? Of course the money ought to have\r\nbeen yours, but after all that makes no difference. The important\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty paused, and then continued firmly: \xe2\x80\x9cThe important\r\nthing is that you should clear yourself\xe2\x80\x94should tell your friends\r\nthe whole truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole truth?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is truth? Where a woman\r\nis concerned, it\xe2\x80\x99s the story that\xe2\x80\x99s easiest to believe. In this\r\ncase it\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal easier to believe Bertha Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s story\r\nthan mine, because she has a big house and an opera box, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconvenient to be on good terms with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Farish still fixed her with an anxious gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what IS your\r\nstory, Lily? I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe any one knows it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy story?\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I know it myself. You see I never\r\nthought of preparing a version in advance as Bertha did\xe2\x80\x94and if I\r\nhad, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should take the trouble to use it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Gerty continued with her quiet reasonableness: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want a\r\nversion prepared in advance\xe2\x80\x94but I want you to tell me exactly what\r\nhappened from the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart gently mimicked her. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Gerty,\r\nhow little imagination you good people have! Why, the beginning\r\nwas in my cradle, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94in the way I was brought up, and the\r\nthings I was taught to care for. Or no\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t blame anybody for\r\nmy faults: I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it was in my blood, that I got it from some\r\nwicked pleasure-loving ancestress, who reacted against the homely\r\nvirtues of New Amsterdam, and wanted to be back at the court of\r\nthe Charleses!\xe2\x80\x9d And as Miss Farish continued to press her with\r\ntroubled eyes, she went on impatiently: \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked me just now for\r\nthe truth\xe2\x80\x94well, the truth about any girl is that once she\xe2\x80\x99s talked\r\nabout she\xe2\x80\x99s done for; and the more she explains her case the worse\r\nit looks.\xe2\x80\x94My good Gerty, you don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to have a cigarette about\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn her stuffy room at the hotel to which she had gone on landing,\r\nLily Bart that evening reviewed her situation. It was the last week\r\nin June, and none of her friends were in town. The few relatives\r\nwho had stayed on, or returned, for the reading of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill, had taken flight again that afternoon to Newport or Long\r\nIsland; and not one of them had made any proffer of hospitality\r\nto Lily. For the first time in her life she found herself utterly\r\nalone except for Gerty Farish. Even at the actual moment of\r\nher break with the Dorsets she had not had so keen a sense of\r\nits consequences, for the Duchess of Beltshire, hearing of the\r\ncatastrophe from Lord Hubert, had instantly offered her protection,\r\nand under her sheltering wing Lily had made an almost triumphant\r\nprogress to London. There she had been sorely tempted to linger on\r\nin a society which asked of her only to amuse and charm it, without\r\nenquiring too curiously how she had acquired her gift for doing\r\nso; but Selden, before they parted, had pressed on her the urgent\r\nneed of returning at once to her aunt, and Lord Hubert, when he\r\npresently reappeared in London, abounded in the same counsel. Lily\r\ndid not need to be told that the Duchess\xe2\x80\x99s championship was not the\r\nbest road to social rehabilitation, and as she was besides aware\r\nthat her noble defender might at any moment drop her in favour of a\r\nnew PROTEGEE, she reluctantly decided to return to America. But she\r\nhad not been ten minutes on her native shore before she realized\r\nthat she had delayed too long to regain it. The Dorsets, the\r\nStepneys, the Brys\xe2\x80\x94all the actors and witnesses in the miserable\r\ndrama\xe2\x80\x94had preceded her with their version of the case; and, even\r\nhad she seen the least chance of gaining a hearing for her own,\r\nsome obscure disdain and reluctance would have restrained her.\r\nShe knew it was not by explanations and counter-charges that she\r\ncould ever hope to recover her lost standing; but even had she felt\r\nthe least trust in their efficacy, she would still have been held\r\nback by the feeling which had kept her from defending herself to\r\nGerty Farish\xe2\x80\x94a feeling that was half pride and half humiliation.\r\nFor though she knew she had been ruthlessly sacrificed to Bertha\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s determination to win back her husband, and though her own\r\nrelation to Dorset had been that of the merest good-fellowship, yet\r\nshe had been perfectly aware from the outset that her part in the\r\naffair was, as Carry Fisher brutally put it, to distract Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention from his wife. That was what she was \xe2\x80\x9cthere for\xe2\x80\x9d: it was\r\nthe price she had chosen to pay for three months of luxury and\r\nfreedom from care. Her habit of resolutely facing the facts, in\r\nher rare moments of introspection, did not now allow her to put\r\nany false gloss on the situation. She had suffered for the very\r\nfaithfulness with which she had carried out her part of the tacit\r\ncompact, but the part was not a handsome one at best, and she saw\r\nit now in all the ugliness of failure.\r\n\r\nShe saw, too, in the same uncompromising light, the train of\r\nconsequences resulting from that failure; and these became clearer\r\nto her with every day of her weary lingering in town. She stayed\r\non partly for the comfort of Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s nearness, and partly\r\nfor lack of knowing where to go. She understood well enough the\r\nnature of the task before her. She must set out to regain, little\r\nby little, the position she had lost; and the first step in the\r\ntedious task was to find out, as soon as possible, on how many\r\nof her friends she could count. Her hopes were mainly centred on\r\nMrs. Trenor, who had treasures of easy-going tolerance for those\r\nwho were amusing or useful to her, and in the noisy rush of whose\r\nexistence the still small voice of detraction was slow to make\r\nitself heard. But Judy, though she must have been apprised of Miss\r\nBart\xe2\x80\x99s return, had not even recognized it by the formal note of\r\ncondolence which her friend\xe2\x80\x99s bereavement demanded. Any advance on\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s side might have been perilous: there was nothing to do but\r\nto trust to the happy chance of an accidental meeting, and Lily\r\nknew that, even so late in the season, there was always a hope of\r\nrunning across her friends in their frequent passages through town.\r\n\r\nTo this end she assiduously showed herself at the restaurants they\r\nfrequented, where, attended by the troubled Gerty, she lunched\r\nluxuriously, as she said, on her expectations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Gerty, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have me let the head-waiter see that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to live on but Aunt Julia\xe2\x80\x99s legacy? Think of Grace\r\nStepney\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction if she came in and found us lunching on cold\r\nmutton and tea! What sweet shall we have today, dear\xe2\x80\x94COUPE JACQUES\r\nor PECHES A LA MELBA?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dropped the MENU abruptly, with a quick heightening of colour,\r\nand Gerty, following her glance, was aware of the advance, from an\r\ninner room, of a party headed by Mrs. Trenor and Carry Fisher. It\r\nwas impossible for these ladies and their companions\xe2\x80\x94among whom\r\nLily had at once distinguished both Trenor and Rosedale\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\npass, in going out, the table at which the two girls were seated;\r\nand Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s sense of the fact betrayed itself in the helpless\r\ntrepidation of her manner. Miss Bart, on the contrary, borne\r\nforward on the wave of her buoyant grace, and neither shrinking\r\nfrom her friends nor appearing to lie in wait for them, gave to\r\nthe encounter the touch of naturalness which she could impart to\r\nthe most strained situations. Such embarrassment as was shown was\r\non Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s side, and manifested itself in the mingling of\r\nexaggerated warmth with imperceptible reservations. Her loudly\r\naffirmed pleasure at seeing Miss Bart took the form of a nebulous\r\ngeneralization, which included neither enquiries as to her future\r\nnor the expression of a definite wish to see her again. Lily,\r\nwell-versed in the language of these omissions, knew that they\r\nwere equally intelligible to the other members of the party: even\r\nRosedale, flushed as he was with the importance of keeping such\r\ncompany, at once took the temperature of Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s cordiality,\r\nand reflected it in his off-hand greeting of Miss Bart. Trenor, red\r\nand uncomfortable, had cut short his salutations on the pretext of\r\na word to say to the head-waiter; and the rest of the group soon\r\nmelted away in Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s wake.\r\n\r\nIt was over in a moment\xe2\x80\x94the waiter, MENU in hand, still hung on\r\nthe result of the choice between COUPE JACQUES and PECHES A LA\r\nMELBA\xe2\x80\x94but Miss Bart, in the interval, had taken the measure of her\r\nfate. Where Judy Trenor led, all the world would follow; and Lily\r\nhad the doomed sense of the castaway who has signalled in vain to\r\nfleeing sails.\r\n\r\nIn a flash she remembered Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s complaints of Carry\r\nFisher\xe2\x80\x99s rapacity, and saw that they denoted an unexpected\r\nacquaintance with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s private affairs. In the large\r\ntumultuous disorder of the life at Bellomont, where no one seemed\r\nto have time to observe any one else, and private aims and personal\r\ninterests were swept along unheeded in the rush of collective\r\nactivities, Lily had fancied herself sheltered from inconvenient\r\nscrutiny; but if Judy knew when Mrs. Fisher borrowed money of\r\nher husband, was she likely to ignore the same transaction on\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s part? If she was careless of his affections she was plainly\r\njealous of his pocket; and in that fact Lily read the explanation\r\nof her rebuff. The immediate result of these conclusions was the\r\npassionate resolve to pay back her debt to Trenor. That obligation\r\ndischarged, she would have but a thousand dollars of Mrs.\r\nPeniston\xe2\x80\x99s legacy left, and nothing to live on but her own small\r\nincome, which was considerably less than Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s wretched\r\npittance; but this consideration gave way to the imperative claim\r\nof her wounded pride. She must be quits with the Trenors first;\r\nafter that she would take thought for the future.\r\n\r\nIn her ignorance of legal procrastinations she had supposed that\r\nher legacy would be paid over within a few days of the reading\r\nof her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s will; and after an interval of anxious suspense,\r\nshe wrote to enquire the cause of the delay. There was another\r\ninterval before Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, who was also one of the\r\nexecutors, replied to the effect that, some questions having arisen\r\nrelative to the interpretation of the will, he and his associates\r\nmight not be in a position to pay the legacies till the close of\r\nthe twelvemonth legally allotted for their settlement. Bewildered\r\nand indignant, Lily resolved to try the effect of a personal\r\nappeal; but she returned from her expedition with a sense of the\r\npowerlessness of beauty and charm against the unfeeling processes\r\nof the law. It seemed intolerable to live on for another year\r\nunder the weight of her debt; and in her extremity she decided to\r\nturn to Miss Stepney, who still lingered in town, immersed in the\r\ndelectable duty of \xe2\x80\x9cgoing over\xe2\x80\x9d her benefactress\xe2\x80\x99s effects. It\r\nwas bitter enough for Lily to ask a favour of Grace Stepney, but\r\nthe alternative was bitterer still; and one morning she presented\r\nherself at Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s, where Grace, for the facilitation of\r\nher pious task, had taken up a provisional abode.\r\n\r\nThe strangeness of entering as a suppliant the house where she had\r\nso long commanded, increased Lily\xe2\x80\x99s desire to shorten the ordeal;\r\nand when Miss Stepney entered the darkened drawing-room, rustling\r\nwith the best quality of crape, her visitor went straight to the\r\npoint: would she be willing to advance the amount of the expected\r\nlegacy?\r\n\r\nGrace, in reply, wept and wondered at the request, bemoaned the\r\ninexorableness of the law, and was astonished that Lily had not\r\nrealized the exact similarity of their positions. Did she think\r\nthat only the payment of the legacies had been delayed? Why, Miss\r\nStepney herself had not received a penny of her inheritance, and\r\nwas paying rent\xe2\x80\x94yes, actually!\xe2\x80\x94for the privilege of living in a\r\nhouse that belonged to her. She was sure it was not what poor dear\r\ncousin Julia would have wished\xe2\x80\x94she had told the executors so to\r\ntheir faces; but they were inaccessible to reason, and there was\r\nnothing to do but to wait. Let Lily take example by her, and be\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x94let them both remember how beautifully patient cousin Julia\r\nhad always been.\r\n\r\nLily made a movement which showed her imperfect assimilation of\r\nthis example. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you will have everything, Grace\xe2\x80\x94it would be easy\r\nfor you to borrow ten times the amount I am asking for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorrow\xe2\x80\x94easy for me to borrow?\xe2\x80\x9d Grace Stepney rose up before her\r\nin sable wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you imagine for a moment that I would raise\r\nmoney on my expectations from cousin Julia, when I know so well her\r\nunspeakable horror of every transaction of the sort? Why, Lily, if\r\nyou must know the truth, it was the idea of your being in debt that\r\nbrought on her illness\xe2\x80\x94you remember she had a slight attack before\r\nyou sailed. Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the particulars, of course\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nWANT to know them\xe2\x80\x94but there were rumours about your affairs that\r\nmade her most unhappy\xe2\x80\x94no one could be with her without seeing that.\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it if you are offended by my telling you this now\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\ncan do anything to make you realize the folly of your course, and\r\nhow deeply SHE disapproved of it, I shall feel it is the truest way\r\nof making up to you for her loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Lily, as Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s door closed on her, that she\r\nwas taking a final leave of her old life. The future stretched\r\nbefore her dull and bare as the deserted length of Fifth Avenue,\r\nand opportunities showed as meagrely as the few cabs trailing in\r\nquest of fares that did not come. The completeness of the analogy\r\nwas, however, disturbed as she reached the sidewalk by the rapid\r\napproach of a hansom which pulled up at sight of her.\r\n\r\nFrom beneath its luggage-laden top, she caught the wave of a\r\nsignalling hand; and the next moment Mrs. Fisher, springing to the\r\nstreet, had folded her in a demonstrative embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re still in town? When I saw\r\nyou the other day at Sherry\xe2\x80\x99s I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to ask\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nbroke off, and added with a burst of frankness: \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is I was\r\nHORRID, Lily, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to tell you so ever since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart protested, drawing back from her penitent clasp;\r\nbut Mrs. Fisher went on with her usual directness: \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\nLily, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s beat about the bush: half the trouble in life is\r\ncaused by pretending there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any. That\xe2\x80\x99s not my way, and I can\r\nonly say I\xe2\x80\x99m thoroughly ashamed of myself for following the other\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s lead. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of that by and bye\xe2\x80\x94tell me now where\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re staying and what your plans are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nkeeping house in there with Grace Stepney, eh?\xe2\x80\x94and it struck me you\r\nmight be rather at loose ends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Lily\xe2\x80\x99s present mood there was no resisting the honest\r\nfriendliness of this appeal, and she said with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cI am at\r\nloose ends for the moment, but Gerty Farish is still in town, and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s good enough to let me be with her whenever she can spare the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher made a slight grimace. \xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a temperate joy. Oh,\r\nI know\xe2\x80\x94Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s a trump, and worth all the rest of us put together;\r\nbut A LA LONGUE you\xe2\x80\x99re used to a little higher seasoning, aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou, dear? And besides, I suppose she\xe2\x80\x99ll be off herself before\r\nlong\xe2\x80\x94the first of August, you say? Well, look here, you can\xe2\x80\x99t spend\r\nyour summer in town; we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of that later too. But meanwhile,\r\nwhat do you say to putting a few things in a trunk and coming down\r\nwith me to the Sam Gormers\xe2\x80\x99 tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd as Lily stared at the breathless suddenness of the suggestion,\r\nshe continued with her easy laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know them and they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know you; but that don\xe2\x80\x99t make a rap of difference. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntaken the Van Alstyne place at Roslyn, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got CARTE BLANCHE\r\nto bring my friends down there\xe2\x80\x94the more the merrier. They do\r\nthings awfully well, and there\xe2\x80\x99s to be rather a jolly party there\r\nthis week\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off, checked by an undefinable change in\r\nMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s expression. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean YOUR particular set,\r\nyou know: rather a different crowd, but very good fun. The fact\r\nis, the Gormers have struck out on a line of their own: what they\r\nwant is to have a good time, and to have it in their own way. They\r\ngave the other thing a few months\xe2\x80\x99 trial, under my distinguished\r\nauspices, and they were really doing extremely well\xe2\x80\x94getting on a\r\ngood deal faster than the Brys, just because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t care as\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94but suddenly they decided that the whole business bored them,\r\nand that what they wanted was a crowd they could really feel at\r\nhome with. Rather original of them, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so? Mattie\r\nGormer HAS got aspirations still; women always have; but she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nawfully easy-going, and Sam won\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered, and they both like\r\nto be the most important people in sight, so they\xe2\x80\x99ve started a sort\r\nof continuous performance of their own, a kind of social Coney\r\nIsland, where everybody is welcome who can make noise enough and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t put on airs. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully good fun myself\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nof the artistic set, you know, any pretty actress that\xe2\x80\x99s going,\r\nand so on. This week, for instance, they have Audrey Anstell,\r\nwho made such a hit last spring in \xe2\x80\x98The Winning of Winny\xe2\x80\x99; and\r\nPaul Morpeth\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s painting Mattie Gormer\xe2\x80\x94and the Dick Bellingers,\r\nand Kate Corby\xe2\x80\x94well, every one you can think of who\xe2\x80\x99s jolly and\r\nmakes a row. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t stand there with your nose in the air, my\r\ndear\xe2\x80\x94it will be a good deal better than a broiling Sunday in town,\r\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll find clever people as well as noisy ones\xe2\x80\x94Morpeth, who\r\nadmires Mattie enormously, always brings one or two of his set.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher drew Lily toward the hansom with friendly authority.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJump in now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll drive round to your hotel\r\nand have your things packed, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have tea, and the two\r\nmaids can meet us at the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a good deal better than a broiling Sunday in town\xe2\x80\x94of that\r\nno doubt remained to Lily as, reclining in the shade of a leafy\r\nverandah, she looked seaward across a stretch of greensward\r\npicturesquely dotted with groups of ladies in lace raiment and men\r\nin tennis flannels. The huge Van Alstyne house and its rambling\r\ndependencies were packed to their fullest capacity with the\r\nGormers\xe2\x80\x99 week-end guests, who now, in the radiance of the Sunday\r\nforenoon, were dispersing themselves over the grounds in quest of\r\nthe various distractions the place afforded: distractions ranging\r\nfrom tennis-courts to shooting-galleries, from bridge and whiskey\r\nwithin doors to motors and steam-launches without. Lily had the\r\nodd sense of having been caught up into the crowd as carelessly\r\nas a passenger is gathered in by an express train. The blonde and\r\ngenial Mrs. Gormer might, indeed, have figured the conductor,\r\ncalmly assigning seats to the rush of travellers, while Carry\r\nFisher represented the porter pushing their bags into place, giving\r\nthem their numbers for the dining-car, and warning them when their\r\nstation was at hand. The train, meanwhile, had scarcely slackened\r\nspeed\xe2\x80\x94life whizzed on with a deafening\xe2\x80\x99 rattle and roar, in which\r\none traveller at least found a welcome refuge from the sound of\r\nher own thoughts. The Gormer MILIEU represented a social out-skirt\r\nwhich Lily had always fastidiously avoided; but it struck her, now\r\nthat she was in it, as only a flamboyant copy of her own world,\r\na caricature approximating the real thing as the \xe2\x80\x9csociety play\xe2\x80\x9d\r\napproaches the manners of the drawing-room. The people about her\r\nwere doing the same things as the Trenors, the Van Osburghs and\r\nthe Dorsets: the difference lay in a hundred shades of aspect and\r\nmanner, from the pattern of the men\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoats to the inflexion\r\nof the women\xe2\x80\x99s voices. Everything was pitched in a higher key,\r\nand there was more of each thing: more noise, more colour, more\r\nchampagne, more familiarity\xe2\x80\x94but also greater good-nature, less\r\nrivalry, and a fresher capacity for enjoyment.\r\n\r\nMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s arrival had been welcomed with an uncritical\r\nfriendliness that first irritated her pride and then brought her\r\nto a sharp sense of her own situation\xe2\x80\x94of the place in life which,\r\nfor the moment, she must accept and make the best of. These people\r\nknew her story\xe2\x80\x94of that her first long talk with Carry Fisher had\r\nleft no doubt: she was publicly branded as the heroine of a \xe2\x80\x9cqueer\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nepisode\xe2\x80\x94but instead of shrinking from her as her own friends had\r\ndone, they received her without question into the easy promiscuity\r\nof their lives. They swallowed her past as easily as they did Miss\r\nAnstell\xe2\x80\x99s, and with no apparent sense of any difference in the size\r\nof the mouthful: all they asked was that she should\xe2\x80\x94in her own way,\r\nfor they recognized a diversity of gifts\xe2\x80\x94contribute as much to the\r\ngeneral amusement as that graceful actress, whose talents, when\r\noff the stage, were of the most varied order. Lily felt at once\r\nthat any tendency to be \xe2\x80\x9cstuck-up,\xe2\x80\x9d to mark a sense of differences\r\nand distinctions, would be fatal to her continuance in the Gormer\r\nset. To be taken in on such terms\xe2\x80\x94and into such a world!\xe2\x80\x94was hard\r\nenough to the lingering pride in her; but she realized, with a\r\npang of self-contempt, that to be excluded from it would, after\r\nall, be harder still. For, almost at once, she had felt the\r\ninsidious charm of slipping back into a life where every material\r\ndifficulty was smoothed away. The sudden escape from a stifling\r\nhotel in a dusty deserted city to the space and luxury of a great\r\ncountry-house fanned by sea breezes, had produced a state of moral\r\nlassitude agreeable enough after the nervous tension and physical\r\ndiscomfort of the past weeks. For the moment she must yield to the\r\nrefreshment her senses craved\xe2\x80\x94after that she would reconsider her\r\nsituation, and take counsel with her dignity. Her enjoyment of her\r\nsurroundings was, indeed, tinged by the unpleasant consideration\r\nthat she was accepting the hospitality and courting the approval\r\nof people she had disdained under other conditions. But she was\r\ngrowing less sensitive on such points: a hard glaze of indifference\r\nwas fast forming over her delicacies and susceptibilities, and each\r\nconcession to expediency hardened the surface a little more.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday, when the party disbanded with uproarious adieux,\r\nthe return to town threw into stronger relief the charms of the\r\nlife she was leaving. The other guests were dispersing to take\r\nup the same existence in a different setting: some at Newport,\r\nsome at Bar Harbour, some in the elaborate rusticity of an\r\nAdirondack camp. Even Gerty Farish, who welcomed Lily\xe2\x80\x99s return\r\nwith tender solicitude, would soon be preparing to join the aunt\r\nwith whom she spent her summers on Lake George: only Lily herself\r\nremained without plan or purpose, stranded in a backwater of the\r\ngreat current of pleasure. But Carry Fisher, who had insisted on\r\ntransporting her to her own house, where she herself was to perch\r\nfor a day or two on the way to the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 camp, came to the rescue\r\nwith a new suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Lily\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is: I want you to take my\r\nplace with Mattie Gormer this summer. They\xe2\x80\x99re taking a party out\r\nto Alaska next month in their private car, and Mattie, who is the\r\nlaziest woman alive, wants me to go with them, and relieve her\r\nof the bother of arranging things; but the Brys want me too\xe2\x80\x94oh,\r\nyes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it up: didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you?\xe2\x80\x94and, to put it frankly,\r\nthough I like the Gormers best, there\xe2\x80\x99s more profit for me in\r\nthe Brys. The fact is, they want to try Newport this summer, and\r\nif I can make it a success for them they\xe2\x80\x94well, they\xe2\x80\x99ll make it a\r\nsuccess for me.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher clasped her hands enthusiastically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Lily, the more I think of my idea the better I like\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94quite as much for you as for myself. The Gormers have both taken\r\na tremendous fancy to you, and the trip to Alaska is\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94the very\r\nthing I should want for you just at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart lifted her eyes with a keen glance. \xe2\x80\x9cTo take me out of\r\nmy friends\xe2\x80\x99 way, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly; and Mrs. Fisher\r\nresponded with a deprecating kiss: \xe2\x80\x9cTo keep you out of their sight\r\ntill they realize how much they miss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Bart went with the Gormers to Alaska; and the expedition, if\r\nit did not produce the effect anticipated by her friend, had at\r\nleast the negative advantage of removing her from the fiery centre\r\nof criticism and discussion. Gerty Farish had opposed the plan with\r\nall the energy of her somewhat inarticulate nature. She had even\r\noffered to give up her visit to Lake George, and remain in town\r\nwith Miss Bart, if the latter would renounce her journey; but Lily\r\ncould disguise her real distaste for this plan under a sufficiently\r\nvalid reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou dear innocent, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\xe2\x80\x9d she protested, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Carry is\r\nquite right, and that I must take up my usual life, and go about\r\namong people as much as possible? If my old friends choose to\r\nbelieve lies about me I shall have to make new ones, that\xe2\x80\x99s all;\r\nand you know beggars mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be choosers. Not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nMattie Gormer\xe2\x80\x94I DO like her: she\xe2\x80\x99s kind and honest and unaffected;\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose I feel grateful to her for making me welcome\r\nat a time when, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve yourself seen, my own family have\r\nunanimously washed their hands of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGerty shook her head, mutely unconvinced. She felt not only that\r\nLily was cheapening herself by making use of an intimacy she would\r\nnever have cultivated from choice, but that, in drifting back now\r\nto her former manner of life, she was forfeiting her last chance\r\nof ever escaping from it. Gerty had but an obscure conception\r\nof what Lily\xe2\x80\x99s actual experience had been: but its consequences\r\nhad established a lasting hold on her pity since the memorable\r\nnight when she had offered up her own secret hope to her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nextremity. To characters like Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s such a sacrifice constitutes\r\na moral claim on the part of the person in whose behalf it has been\r\nmade. Having once helped Lily, she must continue to help her; and\r\nhelping her, must believe in her, because faith is the main-spring\r\nof such natures. But even if Miss Bart, after her renewed taste\r\nof the amenities of life, could have returned to the barrenness\r\nof a New York August, mitigated only by poor Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nher worldly wisdom would have counselled her against such an act\r\nof abnegation. She knew that Carry Fisher was right: that an\r\nopportune absence might be the first step toward rehabilitation,\r\nand that, at any rate, to linger on in town out of season was a\r\nfatal admission of defeat. From the Gormers\xe2\x80\x99 tumultuous progress\r\nacross their native continent, she returned with an altered\r\nview of her situation. The renewed habit of luxury\xe2\x80\x94the daily\r\nwaking to an assured absence of care and presence of material\r\nease\xe2\x80\x94gradually blunted her appreciation of these values, and left\r\nher more conscious of the void they could not fill. Mattie Gormer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nundiscriminating good-nature, and the slap-dash sociability of her\r\nfriends, who treated Lily precisely as they treated each other\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese characteristic notes of difference began to wear upon her\r\nendurance; and the more she saw to criticize in her companions, the\r\nless justification she found for making use of them. The longing\r\nto get back to her former surroundings hardened to a fixed idea;\r\nbut with the strengthening of her purpose came the inevitable\r\nperception that, to attain it, she must exact fresh concessions\r\nfrom her pride. These, for the moment, took the unpleasant form of\r\ncontinuing to cling to her hosts after their return from Alaska.\r\nLittle as she was in the key of their MILIEU, her immense social\r\nfacility, her long habit of adapting herself to others without\r\nsuffering her own outline to be blurred, the skilled manipulation\r\nof all the polished implements of her craft, had won for her an\r\nimportant place in the Gormer group. If their resonant hilarity\r\ncould never be hers, she contributed a note of easy elegance more\r\nvaluable to Mattie Gormer than the louder passages of the band.\r\nSam Gormer and his special cronies stood indeed a little in awe of\r\nher; but Mattie\xe2\x80\x99s following, headed by Paul Morpeth, made her feel\r\nthat they prized her for the very qualities they most conspicuously\r\nlacked. If Morpeth, whose social indolence was as great as his\r\nartistic activity, had abandoned himself to the easy current of\r\nthe Gormer existence, where the minor exactions of politeness were\r\nunknown or ignored, and a man could either break his engagements,\r\nor keep them in a painting-jacket and slippers, he still preserved\r\nhis sense of differences, and his appreciation of graces he had no\r\ntime to cultivate. During the preparations for the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 TABLEAUX\r\nhe had been immensely struck by Lily\xe2\x80\x99s plastic possibilities\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nthe face: too self-controlled for expression; but the rest of\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94gad, what a model she\xe2\x80\x99d make!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and though his abhorrence of the\r\nworld in which he had seen her was too great for him to think of\r\nseeking her there, he was fully alive to the privilege of having\r\nher to look at and listen to while he lounged in Mattie Gormer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndishevelled drawing-room.\r\n\r\nLily had thus formed, in the tumult of her surroundings, a little\r\nnucleus of friendly relations which mitigated the crudeness of\r\nher course in lingering with the Gormers after their return. Nor\r\nwas she without pale glimpses of her own world, especially since\r\nthe breaking up of the Newport season had set the social current\r\nonce more toward Long Island. Kate Corby, whose tastes made her\r\nas promiscuous as Carry Fisher was rendered by her necessities,\r\noccasionally descended on the Gormers, where, after a first\r\nstare of surprise, she took Lily\xe2\x80\x99s presence almost too much as a\r\nmatter of course. Mrs. Fisher, too, appearing frequently in the\r\nneighbourhood, drove over to impart her experiences and give Lily\r\nwhat she called the latest report from the weather-bureau; and the\r\nlatter, who had never directly invited her confidence, could yet\r\ntalk with her more freely than with Gerty Farish, in whose presence\r\nit was impossible even to admit the existence of much that Mrs.\r\nFisher conveniently took for granted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher, moreover, had no embarrassing curiosity. She did not\r\nwish to probe the inwardness of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s situation, but simply to\r\nview it from the outside, and draw her conclusions accordingly; and\r\nthese conclusions, at the end of a confidential talk, she summed up\r\nto her friend in the succinct remark: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must marry as soon as\r\nyou can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily uttered a faint laugh\xe2\x80\x94for once Mrs. Fisher lacked originality.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean, like Gerty Farish, to recommend the unfailing panacea\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98a good man\xe2\x80\x99s love\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either of my candidates would answer to that\r\ndescription,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Fisher after a pause of reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither? Are there actually two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps I ought to say one and a half\xe2\x80\x94for the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart received this with increasing amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cOther things\r\nbeing equal, I think I should prefer a half-husband: who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fly out at me till you hear my reasons\xe2\x80\x94George Dorset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Lily murmured reproachfully; but Mrs. Fisher pressed on\r\nunrebuffed. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not? They had a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 honeymoon when\r\nthey first got back from Europe, but now things are going badly\r\nwith them again. Bertha has been behaving more than ever like\r\na madwoman, and George\xe2\x80\x99s powers of credulity are very nearly\r\nexhausted. They\xe2\x80\x99re at their place here, you know, and I spent last\r\nSunday with them. It was a ghastly party\xe2\x80\x94no one else but poor Neddy\r\nSilverton, who looks like a galley-slave (they used to talk of my\r\nmaking that poor boy unhappy!)\xe2\x80\x94and after luncheon George carried me\r\noff on a long walk, and told me the end would have to come soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart made an incredulous gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as that goes, the\r\nend will never come\xe2\x80\x94Bertha will always know how to get him back\r\nwhen she wants him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher continued to observe her tentatively. \xe2\x80\x9cNot if he has\r\nany one else to turn to! Yes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s just what it comes to: the poor\r\ncreature can\xe2\x80\x99t stand alone. And I remember him such a good fellow,\r\nfull of life and enthusiasm.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and went on, dropping her\r\nglance from Lily\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay with her ten minutes if he\r\nKNEW\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat YOU must, for instance\xe2\x80\x94with the opportunities you\xe2\x80\x99ve had! If\r\nhe had positive proof, I mean\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily interrupted her with a deep blush of displeasure. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease let\r\nus drop the subject, Carry: it\xe2\x80\x99s too odious to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And to divert\r\nher companion\xe2\x80\x99s attention she added, with an attempt at lightness:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your second candidate? We must not forget him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher echoed her laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ll cry out just as\r\nloud if I say\xe2\x80\x94Sim Rosedale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart did not cry out: she sat silent, gazing thoughtfully\r\nat her friend. The suggestion, in truth, gave expression to a\r\npossibility which, in the last weeks, had more than once recurred\r\nto her; but after a moment she said carelessly: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rosedale wants\r\na wife who can establish him in the bosom of the Van Osburghs and\r\nTrenors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher caught her up eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so YOU could\xe2\x80\x94with his\r\nmoney! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see how beautifully it would work out for you\r\nboth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way of making him see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily returned, with a\r\nlaugh intended to dismiss the subject.\r\n\r\nBut in reality it lingered with her long after Mrs. Fisher had\r\ntaken leave. She had seen very little of Rosedale since her\r\nannexation by the Gormers, for he was still steadily bent on\r\npenetrating to the inner Paradise from which she was now excluded;\r\nbut once or twice, when nothing better offered, he had turned up\r\nfor a Sunday, and on these occasions he had left her in no doubt\r\nas to his view of her situation. That he still admired her was,\r\nmore than ever, offensively evident; for in the Gormer circle,\r\nwhere he expanded as in his native element, there were no puzzling\r\nconventions to check the full expression of his approval. But it\r\nwas in the quality of his admiration that she read his shrewd\r\nestimate of her case. He enjoyed letting the Gormers see that he\r\nhad known \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lily\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lily\xe2\x80\x9d to him now\xe2\x80\x94before they\r\nhad had the faintest social existence: enjoyed more especially\r\nimpressing Paul Morpeth with the distance to which their intimacy\r\ndated back. But he let it be felt that that intimacy was a\r\nmere ripple on the surface of a rushing social current, the\r\nkind of relaxation which a man of large interests and manifold\r\npreoccupations permits himself in his hours of ease.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of accepting this view of their past relation, and\r\nof meeting it in the key of pleasantry prevalent among her new\r\nfriends, was deeply humiliating to Lily. But she dared less than\r\never to quarrel with Rosedale. She suspected that her rejection\r\nrankled among the most unforgettable of his rebuffs, and the fact\r\nthat he knew something of her wretched transaction with Trenor,\r\nand was sure to put the basest construction on it, seemed to place\r\nher hopelessly in his power. Yet at Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion a\r\nnew hope had stirred in her. Much as she disliked Rosedale, she\r\nno longer absolutely despised him. For he was gradually attaining\r\nhis object in life, and that, to Lily, was always less despicable\r\nthan to miss it. With the slow unalterable persistency which she\r\nhad always felt in him, he was making his way through the dense\r\nmass of social antagonisms. Already his wealth, and the masterly\r\nuse he had made of it, were giving him an enviable prominence in\r\nthe world of affairs, and placing Wall Street under obligations\r\nwhich only Fifth Avenue could repay. In response to these claims,\r\nhis name began to figure on municipal committees and charitable\r\nboards; he appeared at banquets to distinguished strangers, and\r\nhis candidacy at one of the fashionable clubs was discussed with\r\ndiminishing opposition. He had figured once or twice at the Trenor\r\ndinners, and had learned to speak with just the right note of\r\ndisdain of the big Van Osburgh crushes; and all he now needed was a\r\nwife whose affiliations would shorten the last tedious steps of his\r\nascent. It was with that object that, a year earlier, he had fixed\r\nhis affections on Miss Bart; but in the interval he had mounted\r\nnearer to the goal, while she had lost the power to abbreviate the\r\nremaining steps of the way. All this she saw with the clearness of\r\nvision that came to her in moments of despondency. It was success\r\nthat dazzled her\xe2\x80\x94she could distinguish facts plainly enough in the\r\ntwilight of failure. And the twilight, as she now sought to pierce\r\nit, was gradually lighted by a faint spark of reassurance. Under\r\nthe utilitarian motive of Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s wooing she had felt, clearly\r\nenough, the heat of personal inclination. She would not have\r\ndetested him so heartily had she not known that he dared to admire\r\nher. What, then, if the passion persisted, though the other motive\r\nhad ceased to sustain it? She had never even tried to please him\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhad been drawn to her in spite of her manifest disdain. What if she\r\nnow chose to exert the power which, even in its passive state, he\r\nhad felt so strongly? What if she made him marry her for love, now\r\nthat he had no other reason for marrying her?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\n\r\nAs became persons of their rising consequence, the Gormers were\r\nengaged in building a country-house on Long Island; and it was a\r\npart of Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s duty to attend her hostess on frequent visits\r\nof inspection to the new estate. There, while Mrs. Gormer plunged\r\ninto problems of lighting and sanitation, Lily had leisure to\r\nwander, in the bright autumn air, along the tree-fringed bay to\r\nwhich the land declined. Little as she was addicted to solitude,\r\nthere had come to be moments when it seemed a welcome escape\r\nfrom the empty noises of her life. She was weary of being swept\r\npassively along a current of pleasure and business in which she\r\nhad no share; weary of seeing other people pursue amusement and\r\nsquander money, while she felt herself of no more account among\r\nthem than an expensive toy in the hands of a spoiled child.\r\n\r\nIt was in this frame of mind that, striking back from the shore\r\none morning into the windings of an unfamiliar lane, she came\r\nsuddenly upon the figure of George Dorset. The Dorset place was in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the Gormers\xe2\x80\x99 newly-acquired estate,\r\nand in her motor-flights thither with Mrs. Gormer, Lily had caught\r\none or two passing glimpses of the couple; but they moved in so\r\ndifferent an orbit that she had not considered the possibility of a\r\ndirect encounter.\r\n\r\nDorset, swinging along with bent head, in moody abstraction, did\r\nnot see Miss Bart till he was close upon her; but the sight,\r\ninstead of bringing him to a halt, as she had half-expected, sent\r\nhim toward her with an eagerness which found expression in his\r\nopening words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart!\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99ll shake hands, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoping to meet\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94I should have written to you if I\xe2\x80\x99d dared.\xe2\x80\x9d His face, with its\r\ntossed red hair and straggling moustache, had a driven uneasy look,\r\nas though life had become an unceasing race between himself and the\r\nthoughts at his heels.\r\n\r\nThe look drew a word of compassionate greeting from Lily, and he\r\npressed on, as if encouraged by her tone: \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to apologize\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nask you to forgive me for the miserable part I played\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe checked him with a quick gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us speak of it: I\r\nwas very sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a tinge of disdain which,\r\nas she instantly perceived, was not lost on him.\r\n\r\nHe flushed to his haggard eyes, flushed so cruelly that she\r\nrepented the thrust. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might well be; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94you must\r\nlet me explain. I was deceived: abominably deceived\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am still more sorry for you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed, without\r\nirony; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you must see that I am not exactly the person with whom\r\nthe subject can be discussed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met this with a look of genuine wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it to\r\nyou, of all people, that I owe an explanation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo explanation is necessary: the situation was perfectly clear to\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured, his head drooping again, and his irresolute\r\nhand switching at the underbrush along the lane. But as Lily made a\r\nmovement to pass on, he broke out with fresh vehemence: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart,\r\nfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t turn from me! We used to be good friends\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nwere always kind to me\xe2\x80\x94and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I need a friend now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lamentable weakness of the words roused a motion of pity in\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s breast. She too needed friends\xe2\x80\x94she had tasted the pang of\r\nloneliness; and her resentment of Bertha Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s cruelty softened\r\nher heart to the poor wretch who was after all the chief of\r\nBertha\xe2\x80\x99s victims.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still wish to be kind; I feel no ill-will toward you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must understand that after what has happened we can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nfriends again\xe2\x80\x94we can\xe2\x80\x99t see each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you ARE kind\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re merciful\xe2\x80\x94you always were!\xe2\x80\x9d He fixed his\r\nmiserable gaze on her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why can\xe2\x80\x99t we be friends\xe2\x80\x94why not, when\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve repented in dust and ashes? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it hard that you should\r\ncondemn me to suffer for the falseness, the treachery of others? I\r\nwas punished enough at the time\xe2\x80\x94is there to be no respite for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought you had found complete respite in the\r\nreconciliation which was effected at my expense,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily began, with\r\nrenewed impatience; but he broke in imploringly: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it in\r\nthat way\xe2\x80\x94when that\xe2\x80\x99s been the worst of my punishment. My God! what\r\ncould I do\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I powerless? You were singled out as a sacrifice:\r\nany word I might have said would have been turned against you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you; all I ask you to understand is\r\nthat, after the use Bertha chose to make of me\xe2\x80\x94after all that her\r\nbehaviour has since implied\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible that you and I should\r\nmeet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to stand before her, in his dogged weakness. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94need it be? Mightn\xe2\x80\x99t there be circumstances\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d he checked\r\nhimself, slashing at the wayside weeds in a wider radius. Then he\r\nbegan again: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart, listen\xe2\x80\x94give me a minute. If we\xe2\x80\x99re not to\r\nmeet again, at least let me have a hearing now. You say we can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nfriends after\xe2\x80\x94after what has happened. But can\xe2\x80\x99t I at least appeal\r\nto your pity? Can\xe2\x80\x99t I move you if I ask you to think of me as a\r\nprisoner\xe2\x80\x94a prisoner you alone can set free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s inward start betrayed itself in a quick blush: was it\r\npossible that this was really the sense of Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadumbrations?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see how I can possibly be of any help to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmurmured, drawing back a little from the mounting excitement of his\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nHer tone seemed to sober him, as it had so often done in his\r\nstormiest moments. The stubborn lines of his face relaxed, and he\r\nsaid, with an abrupt drop to docility: \xe2\x80\x9cYou WOULD see, if you\xe2\x80\x99d be\r\nas merciful as you used to be: and heaven knows I\xe2\x80\x99ve never needed\r\nit more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment, moved in spite of herself by this reminder of\r\nher influence over him. Her fibres had been softened by suffering,\r\nand the sudden glimpse into his mocked and broken life disarmed her\r\ncontempt for his weakness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry for you\xe2\x80\x94I would help you willingly; but you must\r\nhave other friends, other advisers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had a friend like you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered simply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nbesides\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re the only person\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his voice dropped to\r\na whisper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe only person who knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she felt her colour change; again her heart rose in\r\nprecipitate throbs to meet what she felt was coming. He lifted his\r\neyes to her entreatingly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou do see, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You understand?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m desperate\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m at the end of my tether. I want to be free, and\r\nyou can free me. I know you can. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to keep me bound\r\nfast in hell, do you? You can\xe2\x80\x99t want to take such a vengeance as\r\nthat. You were always kind\xe2\x80\x94your eyes are kind now. You say you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsorry for me. Well, it rests with you to show it; and heaven knows\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to keep you back. You understand, of course\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a hint of publicity\xe2\x80\x94not a sound or a syllable to\r\nconnect you with the thing. It would never come to that, you know:\r\nall I need is to be able to say definitely: \xe2\x80\x98I know this\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94and this\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and the fight would drop, and the way be cleared,\r\nand the whole abominable business swept out of sight in a second.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke pantingly, like a tired runner, with breaks of exhaustion\r\nbetween his words; and through the breaks she caught, as through\r\nthe shifting rents of a fog, great golden vistas of peace and\r\nsafety. For there was no mistaking the definite intention behind\r\nhis vague appeal; she could have filled up the blanks without the\r\nhelp of Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s insinuations. Here was a man who turned to\r\nher in the extremity of his loneliness and his humiliation: if she\r\ncame to him at such a moment he would be hers with all the force of\r\nhis deluded faith. And the power to make him so lay in her hand\xe2\x80\x94lay\r\nthere in a completeness he could not even remotely conjecture.\r\nRevenge and rehabilitation might be hers at a stroke\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nsomething dazzling in the completeness of the opportunity.\r\n\r\nShe stood silent, gazing away from him down the autumnal stretch\r\nof the deserted lane. And suddenly fear possessed her\xe2\x80\x94fear of\r\nherself, and of the terrible force of the temptation. All her past\r\nweaknesses were like so many eager accomplices drawing her toward\r\nthe path their feet had already smoothed. She turned quickly, and\r\nheld out her hand to Dorset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the world that I can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing? Ah, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9csay what\xe2\x80\x99s true: that you\r\nabandon me like the others. You, the only creature who could have\r\nsaved me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye\xe2\x80\x94goodbye,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated hurriedly; and as she moved away\r\nshe heard him cry out on a last note of entreaty: \xe2\x80\x9cAt least you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlet me see you once more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLily, on regaining the Gormer grounds, struck rapidly across the\r\nlawn toward the unfinished house, where she fancied that her\r\nhostess might be speculating, not too resignedly, on the cause of\r\nher delay; for, like many unpunctual persons, Mrs. Gormer disliked\r\nto be kept waiting.\r\n\r\nAs Miss Bart reached the avenue, however, she saw a smart phaeton\r\nwith a high-stepping pair disappear behind the shrubbery in the\r\ndirection of the gate; and on the doorstep stood Mrs. Gormer, with\r\na glow of retrospective pleasure on her open countenance. At sight\r\nof Lily the glow deepened to an embarrassed red, and she said\r\nwith a slight laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see my visitor? Oh, I thought you\r\ncame back by the avenue. It was Mrs. George Dorset\xe2\x80\x94she said she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndropped in to make a neighbourly call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily met the announcement with her usual composure, though her\r\nexperience of Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncrasies would not have led her to\r\ninclude the neighbourly instinct among them; and Mrs. Gormer,\r\nrelieved to see that she gave no sign of surprise, went on with\r\na deprecating laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course what really brought her was\r\ncuriosity\xe2\x80\x94she made me take her all over the house. But no one could\r\nhave been nicer\xe2\x80\x94no airs, you know, and so good-natured: I can quite\r\nsee why people think her so fascinating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis surprising event, coinciding too completely with her\r\nmeeting with Dorset to be regarded as contingent upon it, had\r\nyet immediately struck Lily with a vague sense of foreboding.\r\nIt was not in Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s habits to be neighbourly, much less to\r\nmake advances to any one outside the immediate circle of her\r\naffinities. She had always consistently ignored the world of outer\r\naspirants, or had recognized its individual members only when\r\nprompted by motives of self-interest; and the very capriciousness\r\nof her condescensions had, as Lily was aware, given them special\r\nvalue in the eyes of the persons she distinguished. Lily saw\r\nthis now in Mrs. Gormer\xe2\x80\x99s unconcealable complacency, and in the\r\nhappy irrelevance with which, for the next day or two, she quoted\r\nBertha\xe2\x80\x99s opinions and speculated on the origin of her gown. All\r\nthe secret ambitions which Mrs. Gormer\xe2\x80\x99s native indolence, and the\r\nattitude of her companions, kept in habitual abeyance, were now\r\ngerminating afresh in the glow of Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s advances; and whatever\r\nthe cause of the latter, Lily saw that, if they were followed up,\r\nthey were likely to have a disturbing effect upon her own future.\r\n\r\nShe had arranged to break the length of her stay with her new\r\nfriends by one or two visits to other acquaintances as recent;\r\nand on her return from this somewhat depressing excursion she was\r\nimmediately conscious that Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s influence was still in\r\nthe air. There had been another exchange of visits, a tea at a\r\ncountry-club, an encounter at a hunt ball; there was even a rumour\r\nof an approaching dinner, which Mattie Gormer, with an unnatural\r\neffort at discretion, tried to smuggle out of the conversation\r\nwhenever Miss Bart took part in it.\r\n\r\nThe latter had already planned to return to town after a farewell\r\nSunday with her friends; and, with Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s aid, had\r\ndiscovered a small private hotel where she might establish herself\r\nfor the winter. The hotel being on the edge of a fashionable\r\nneighbourhood, the price of the few square feet she was to\r\noccupy was considerably in excess of her means; but she found a\r\njustification for her dislike of poorer quarters in the argument\r\nthat, at this particular juncture, it was of the utmost importance\r\nto keep up a show of prosperity. In reality, it was impossible for\r\nher, while she had the means to pay her way for a week ahead, to\r\nlapse into a form of existence like Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s. She had never\r\nbeen so near the brink of insolvency; but she could at least manage\r\nto meet her weekly hotel bill, and having settled the heaviest of\r\nher previous debts out of the money she had received from Trenor,\r\nshe had a still fair margin of credit to go upon. The situation,\r\nhowever, was not agreeable enough to lull her to complete\r\nunconsciousness of its insecurity. Her rooms, with their cramped\r\noutlook down a sallow vista of brick walls and fire-escapes, her\r\nlonely meals in the dark restaurant with its surcharged ceiling and\r\nhaunting smell of coffee\xe2\x80\x94all these material discomforts, which were\r\nyet to be accounted as so many privileges soon to be withdrawn,\r\nkept constantly before her the disadvantages of her state; and her\r\nmind reverted the more insistently to Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s counsels. Beat\r\nabout the question as she would, she knew the outcome of it was\r\nthat she must try to marry Rosedale; and in this conviction she was\r\nfortified by an unexpected visit from George Dorset.\r\n\r\nShe found him, on the first Sunday after her return to town,\r\npacing her narrow sitting-room to the imminent peril of the few\r\nknick-knacks with which she had tried to disguise its plush\r\nexuberances; but the sight of her seemed to quiet him, and he said\r\nmeekly that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to bother her\xe2\x80\x94that he asked only to be\r\nallowed to sit for half an hour and talk of anything she liked.\r\nIn reality, as she knew, he had but one subject: himself and his\r\nwretchedness; and it was the need of her sympathy that had drawn\r\nhim back. But he began with a pretence of questioning her about\r\nherself, and as she replied, she saw that, for the first time,\r\na faint realization of her plight penetrated the dense surface\r\nof his self-absorption. Was it possible that her old beast of an\r\naunt had actually cut her off? That she was living alone like this\r\nbecause there was no one else for her to go to, and that she really\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t more than enough to keep alive on till the wretched little\r\nlegacy was paid? The fibres of sympathy were nearly atrophied in\r\nhim, but he was suffering so intensely that he had a faint glimpse\r\nof what other sufferings might mean\xe2\x80\x94and, as she perceived, an\r\nalmost simultaneous perception of the way in which her particular\r\nmisfortunes might serve him.\r\n\r\nWhen at length she dismissed him, on the pretext that she must\r\ndress for dinner, he lingered entreatingly on the threshold to\r\nblurt out: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been such a comfort\xe2\x80\x94do say you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me see you\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But to this direct appeal it was impossible to give an\r\nassent; and she said with friendly decisiveness: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x94but you\r\nknow why I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe coloured to the eyes, pushed the door shut, and stood before her\r\nembarrassed but insistent. \xe2\x80\x9cI know how you might, if you would\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthings were different\xe2\x80\x94and it lies with you to make them so. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njust a word to say, and you put me out of my misery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, and for a second she trembled again with the\r\nnearness of the temptation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re mistaken; I know nothing; I saw\r\nnothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, striving, by sheer force of reiteration,\r\nto build a barrier between herself and her peril; and as he turned\r\naway, groaning out \xe2\x80\x9cYou sacrifice us both,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued to\r\nrepeat, as if it were a charm: \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing\xe2\x80\x94absolutely nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLily had seen little of Rosedale since her illuminating talk with\r\nMrs. Fisher, but on the two or three occasions when they had met\r\nshe was conscious of having distinctly advanced in his favour.\r\nThere could be no doubt that he admired her as much as ever, and\r\nshe believed it rested with herself to raise his admiration to\r\nthe point where it should bear down the lingering counsels of\r\nexpediency. The task was not an easy one; but neither was it easy,\r\nin her long sleepless nights, to face the thought of what George\r\nDorset was so clearly ready to offer. Baseness for baseness, she\r\nhated the other least: there were even moments when a marriage with\r\nRosedale seemed the only honourable solution of her difficulties.\r\nShe did not indeed let her imagination range beyond the day of\r\nplighting: after that everything faded into a haze of material\r\nwell-being, in which the personality of her benefactor remained\r\nmercifully vague. She had learned, in her long vigils, that there\r\nwere certain things not good to think of, certain midnight images\r\nthat must at any cost be exorcised\xe2\x80\x94and one of these was the image\r\nof herself as Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nCarry Fisher, on the strength, as she frankly owned, of the\r\nBrys\xe2\x80\x99 Newport success, had taken for the autumn months a small\r\nhouse at Tuxedo; and thither Lily was bound on the Sunday after\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s visit. Though it was nearly dinner-time when she arrived,\r\nher hostess was still out, and the firelit quiet of the small\r\nsilent house descended on her spirit with a sense of peace and\r\nfamiliarity. It may be doubted if such an emotion had ever before\r\nbeen evoked by Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s surroundings; but, contrasted to\r\nthe world in which Lily had lately lived, there was an air of\r\nrepose and stability in the very placing of the furniture, and in\r\nthe quiet competence of the parlour-maid who led her up to her\r\nroom. Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s unconventionality was, after all, a merely\r\nsuperficial divergence from an inherited social creed, while the\r\nmanners of the Gormer circle represented their first attempt to\r\nformulate such a creed for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time since her return from Europe that Lily had\r\nfound herself in a congenial atmosphere, and the stirring of\r\nfamiliar associations had almost prepared her, as she descended\r\nthe stairs before dinner, to enter upon a group of her old\r\nacquaintances. But this expectation was instantly checked by the\r\nreflection that the friends who remained loyal were precisely those\r\nwho would be least willing to expose her to such encounters; and\r\nit was hardly with surprise that she found, instead, Mr. Rosedale\r\nkneeling domestically on the drawing-room hearth before his\r\nhostess\xe2\x80\x99s little girl.\r\n\r\nRosedale in the paternal role was hardly a figure to soften Lily;\r\nyet she could not but notice a quality of homely goodness in his\r\nadvances to the child. They were not, at any rate, the premeditated\r\nand perfunctory endearments of the guest under his hostess\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neye, for he and the little girl had the room to themselves; and\r\nsomething in his attitude made him seem a simple and kindly being\r\ncompared to the small critical creature who endured his homage.\r\nYes, he would be kind\xe2\x80\x94Lily, from the threshold, had time to\r\nfeel\xe2\x80\x94kind in his gross, unscrupulous, rapacious way, the way of the\r\npredatory creature with his mate. She had but a moment in which\r\nto consider whether this glimpse of the fireside man mitigated\r\nher repugnance, or gave it, rather, a more concrete and intimate\r\nform; for at sight of her he was immediately on his feet again, the\r\nflorid and dominant Rosedale of Mattie Gormer\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room.\r\n\r\nIt was no surprise to Lily to find that he had been selected as her\r\nonly fellow-guest. Though she and her hostess had not met since\r\nthe latter\xe2\x80\x99s tentative discussion of her future, Lily knew that\r\nthe acuteness which enabled Mrs. Fisher to lay a safe and pleasant\r\ncourse through a world of antagonistic forces was not infrequently\r\nexercised for the benefit of her friends. It was, in fact,\r\ncharacteristic of Carry that, while she actively gleaned her own\r\nstores from the fields of affluence, her real sympathies were on\r\nthe other side\xe2\x80\x94with the unlucky, the unpopular, the unsuccessful,\r\nwith all her hungry fellow-toilers in the shorn stubble of success.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s experience guarded her against the mistake of\r\nexposing Lily, for the first evening, to the unmitigated impression\r\nof Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s personality. Kate Corby and two or three men dropped\r\nin to dinner, and Lily, alive to every detail of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmethod, saw that such opportunities as had been contrived for her\r\nwere to be deferred till she had, as it were, gained courage to\r\nmake effectual use of them. She had a sense of acquiescing in this\r\nplan with the passiveness of a sufferer resigned to the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntouch; and this feeling of almost lethargic helplessness continued\r\nwhen, after the departure of the guests, Mrs. Fisher followed her\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I come in and smoke a cigarette over your fire? If we talk in\r\nmy room we shall disturb the child.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher looked about her\r\nwith the eye of the solicitous hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to\r\nmake yourself comfortable, dear? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a jolly little house?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a blessing to have a few quiet weeks with the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarry, in her rare moments of prosperity, became so expansively\r\nmaternal that Miss Bart sometimes wondered whether, if she could\r\never get time and money enough, she would not end by devoting them\r\nboth to her daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a well-earned rest: I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\nsinking down with a sigh of content on the pillowed lounge near\r\nthe fire. \xe2\x80\x9cLouisa Bry is a stern task-master: I often used to\r\nwish myself back with the Gormers. Talk of love making people\r\njealous and suspicious\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to social ambition! Louisa\r\nused to lie awake at night wondering whether the women who called\r\non us called on ME because I was with her, or on HER because she\r\nwas with me; and she was always laying traps to find out what\r\nI thought. Of course I had to disown my oldest friends, rather\r\nthan let her suspect she owed me the chance of making a single\r\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x94when, all the while, that was what she had me there\r\nfor, and what she wrote me a handsome cheque for when the season\r\nwas over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher was not a woman who talked of herself without cause,\r\nand the practice of direct speech, far from precluding in her an\r\noccasional resort to circuitous methods, served rather, at crucial\r\nmoments, the purpose of the juggler\xe2\x80\x99s chatter while he shifts the\r\ncontents of his sleeves. Through the haze of her cigarette-smoke\r\nshe continued to gaze meditatively at Miss Bart, who, having\r\ndismissed her maid, sat before the toilet table shaking out over\r\nher shoulders the loosened undulations of her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hair\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful, Lily. Thinner\xe2\x80\x94? What does that matter,\r\nwhen it\xe2\x80\x99s so light and alive? So many women\xe2\x80\x99s worries seem to go\r\nstraight to their hair\xe2\x80\x94but yours looks as if there had never been\r\nan anxious thought under it. I never saw you look better than you\r\ndid this evening. Mattie Gormer told me that Morpeth wanted to\r\npaint you\xe2\x80\x94why don\xe2\x80\x99t you let him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s immediate answer was to address a critical glance\r\nto the reflection of the countenance under discussion. Then she\r\nsaid, with a slight touch of irritation: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to accept a\r\nportrait from Paul Morpeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher mused. \xe2\x80\x9cN\xe2\x80\x94no. And just now, especially\xe2\x80\x94well, he can do\r\nyou after you\xe2\x80\x99re married.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited a moment, and then went on:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I had a visit from Mattie the other day. She turned\r\nup here last Sunday\xe2\x80\x94and with Bertha Dorset, of all people in the\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused again to measure the effect of this announcement on her\r\nhearer, but the brush in Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s lifted hand maintained its\r\nunwavering stroke from brow to nape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was more astonished,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Fisher pursued. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\ntwo women less predestined to intimacy\xe2\x80\x94from Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint,\r\nthat is; for of course poor Mattie thinks it natural enough that\r\nshe should be singled out\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt the rabbit always thinks\r\nit is fascinating the anaconda. Well, you know I\xe2\x80\x99ve always told\r\nyou that Mattie secretly longed to bore herself with the really\r\nfashionable; and now that the chance has come, I see that she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncapable of sacrificing all her old friends to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily laid aside her brush and turned a penetrating glance upon her\r\nfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cIncluding ME?\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Mrs. Fisher, rising to push back a log from\r\nthe hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Bertha means, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart went on steadily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor of course she always means something; and before I left Long\r\nIsland I saw that she was beginning to lay her toils for Mattie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Fisher sighed evasively. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has her fast now, at any rate.\r\nTo think of that loud independence of Mattie\xe2\x80\x99s being only a\r\nsubtler form of snobbishness! Bertha can already make her believe\r\nanything she pleases\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she\xe2\x80\x99s begun, my poor child, by\r\ninsinuating horrors about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily flushed under the shadow of her drooping hair. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world\r\nis too vile,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, averting herself from Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxious scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a pretty place; and the only way to keep a footing in it\r\nis to fight it on its own terms\xe2\x80\x94and above all, my dear, not alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMrs. Fisher gathered up her floating implications in a resolute\r\ngrasp. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve told me so little that I can only guess what has\r\nbeen happening; but in the rush we all live in there\xe2\x80\x99s no time to\r\nkeep on hating any one without a cause, and if Bertha is still\r\nnasty enough to want to injure you with other people it must be\r\nbecause she\xe2\x80\x99s still afraid of you. From her standpoint there\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\none reason for being afraid of you; and my own idea is that, if you\r\nwant to punish her, you hold the means in your hand. I believe you\r\ncan marry George Dorset tomorrow; but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that\r\nparticular form of retaliation, the only thing to save you from\r\nBertha is to marry somebody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light projected on the situation by Mrs. Fisher had the\r\ncheerless distinctness of a winter dawn. It outlined the facts with\r\na cold precision unmodified by shade or colour, and refracted, as\r\nit were, from the blank walls of the surrounding limitations: she\r\nhad opened windows from which no sky was ever visible. But the\r\nidealist subdued to vulgar necessities must employ vulgar minds to\r\ndraw the inferences to which he cannot stoop; and it was easier for\r\nLily to let Mrs. Fisher formulate her case than to put it plainly\r\nto herself. Once confronted with it, however, she went the full\r\nlength of its consequences; and these had never been more clearly\r\npresent to her than when, the next afternoon, she set out for a\r\nwalk with Rosedale.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those still November days when the air is haunted\r\nwith the light of summer, and something in the lines of the\r\nlandscape, and in the golden haze which bathed them, recalled to\r\nMiss Bart the September afternoon when she had climbed the slopes\r\nof Bellomont with Selden. The importunate memory was kept before\r\nher by its ironic contrast to her present situation, since her walk\r\nwith Selden had represented an irresistible flight from just such\r\na climax as the present excursion was designed to bring about. But\r\nother memories importuned her also; the recollection of similar\r\nsituations, as skillfully led up to, but through some malice of\r\nfortune, or her own unsteadiness of purpose, always failing of\r\nthe intended result. Well, her purpose was steady enough now. She\r\nsaw that the whole weary work of rehabilitation must begin again,\r\nand against far greater odds, if Bertha Dorset should succeed in\r\nbreaking up her friendship with the Gormers; and her longing for\r\nshelter and security was intensified by the passionate desire to\r\ntriumph over Bertha, as only wealth and predominance could triumph\r\nover her. As the wife of Rosedale\xe2\x80\x94the Rosedale she felt it in her\r\npower to create\xe2\x80\x94she would at least present an invulnerable front to\r\nher enemy.\r\n\r\nShe had to draw upon this thought, as upon some fiery stimulant, to\r\nkeep up her part in the scene toward which Rosedale was too frankly\r\ntending. As she walked beside him, shrinking in every nerve from\r\nthe way in which his look and tone made free of her, yet telling\r\nherself that this momentary endurance of his mood was the price she\r\nmust pay for her ultimate power over him, she tried to calculate\r\nthe exact point at which concession must turn to resistance, and\r\nthe price HE would have to pay be made equally clear to him. But\r\nhis dapper self-confidence seemed impenetrable to such hints, and\r\nshe had a sense of something hard and self-contained behind the\r\nsuperficial warmth of his manner.\r\n\r\nThey had been seated for some time in the seclusion of a rocky glen\r\nabove the lake, when she suddenly cut short the culmination of an\r\nimpassioned period by turning upon him the grave loveliness of her\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI DO believe what you say, Mr. Rosedale,\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly; \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nam ready to marry you whenever you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosedale, reddening to the roots of his glossy hair, received this\r\nannouncement with a recoil which carried him to his feet, where he\r\nhalted before her in an attitude of almost comic discomfiture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor I suppose that is what you do wish,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, in the\r\nsame quiet tone. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, though I was unable to consent when you\r\nspoke to me in this way before, I am ready, now that I know you so\r\nmuch better, to trust my happiness to your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke with the noble directness which she could command on\r\nsuch occasions, and which was like a large steady light thrown\r\nacross the tortuous darkness of the situation. In its inconvenient\r\nbrightness Rosedale seemed to waver a moment, as though conscious\r\nthat every avenue of escape was unpleasantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nThen he gave a short laugh, and drew out a gold cigarette-case, in\r\nwhich, with plump jewelled fingers, he groped for a gold-tipped\r\ncigarette. Selecting one, he paused to contemplate it a moment\r\nbefore saying: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Lily, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any\r\nlittle misapprehension between us\xe2\x80\x94but you made me feel my suit was\r\nso hopeless that I had really no intention of renewing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s blood tingled with the grossness of the rebuff; but she\r\nchecked the first leap of her anger, and said in a tone of gentle\r\ndignity: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no one but myself to blame if I gave you the\r\nimpression that my decision was final.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer word-play was always too quick for him, and this reply held him\r\nin puzzled silence while she extended her hand and added, with the\r\nfaintest inflection of sadness in her voice: \xe2\x80\x9cBefore we bid each\r\nother goodbye, I want at least to thank you for having once thought\r\nof me as you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe touch of her hand, the moving softness of her look,\r\nthrilled a vulnerable fibre in Rosedale. It was her exquisite\r\ninaccessibleness, the sense of distance she could convey without a\r\nhint of disdain, that made it most difficult for him to give her up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you talk of saying goodbye? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t we going to be good\r\nfriends all the same?\xe2\x80\x9d he urged, without releasing her hand.\r\n\r\nShe drew it away quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your idea of being good\r\nfriends?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned with a slight smile. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking love to me\r\nwithout asking me to marry you?\xe2\x80\x9d Rosedale laughed with a recovered\r\nsense of ease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s about the size of it, I suppose. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help making\r\nlove to you\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how any man could; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to ask\r\nyou to marry me as long as I can keep out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI like your frankness; but I am afraid our\r\nfriendship can hardly continue on those terms.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned away, as\r\nthough to mark that its final term had in fact been reached, and\r\nhe followed her for a few steps with a baffled sense of her having\r\nafter all kept the game in her own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began impulsively; but she walked on without\r\nseeming to hear him.\r\n\r\nHe overtook her in a few quick strides, and laid an entreating hand\r\non her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lily\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t hurry away like that. You\xe2\x80\x99re beastly\r\nhard on a fellow; but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind speaking the truth I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee why you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had paused a moment with raised brows, drawing away\r\ninstinctively from his touch, though she made no effort to evade\r\nhis words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was under the impression,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you had done so\r\nwithout waiting for my permission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear my reasons for doing it, then? We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nneither of us such new hands that a little plain speaking is going\r\nto hurt us. I\xe2\x80\x99m all broken up on you: there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new in that.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m more in love with you than I was this time last year; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to face the fact that the situation is changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to confront him with the same air of ironic\r\ncomposure. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to say that I\xe2\x80\x99m not as desirable a match as\r\nyou thought me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I do mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered resolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\ninto what\xe2\x80\x99s happened. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the stories about you\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nWANT to believe them. But they\xe2\x80\x99re there, and my not believing them\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t going to alter the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flushed to her temples, but the extremity of her need checked\r\nthe retort on her lip and she continued to face him composedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthey are not true,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t THAT alter the situation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe met this with a steady gaze of his small stock-taking eyes,\r\nwhich made her feel herself no more than some superfine human\r\nmerchandise. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it does in novels; but I\xe2\x80\x99m certain it don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nin real life. You know that as well as I do: if we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking the\r\ntruth, let\xe2\x80\x99s speak the whole truth. Last year I was wild to marry\r\nyou, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at me: this year\xe2\x80\x94well, you appear to be\r\nwilling. Now, what has changed in the interval? Your situation,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. Then you thought you could do better; now\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think you can?\xe2\x80\x9d broke from her ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, I do: in one way, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d He stood before her, his\r\nhands in his pockets, his chest sturdily expanded under its vivid\r\nwaistcoat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this way, you see: I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a pretty steady grind\r\nof it these last years, working up my social position. Think it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfunny I should say that? Why should I mind saying I want to get\r\ninto society? A man ain\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed to say he wants to own a racing\r\nstable or a picture gallery. Well, a taste for society\xe2\x80\x99s just\r\nanother kind of hobby. Perhaps I want to get even with some of\r\nthe people who cold-shouldered me last year\xe2\x80\x94put it that way if it\r\nsounds better. Anyhow, I want to have the run of the best houses;\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99m getting it too, little by little. But I know the quickest\r\nway to queer yourself with the right people is to be seen with the\r\nwrong ones; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason I want to avoid mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart continued to stand before him in a silence that might\r\nhave expressed either mockery or a half-reluctant respect for his\r\ncandour, and after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cThere it is, you\r\nsee. I\xe2\x80\x99m more in love with you than ever, but if I married you now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d queer myself for good and all, and everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for\r\nall these years would be wasted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe received this with a look from which all tinge of resentment\r\nhad faded. After the tissue of social falsehoods in which she had\r\nso long moved it was refreshing to step into the open daylight of\r\nan avowed expediency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cA year ago I should have been of\r\nuse to you, and now I should be an encumbrance; and I like you for\r\ntelling me so quite honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d She extended her hand with a smile.\r\n\r\nAgain the gesture had a disturbing effect upon Mr. Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-command. \xe2\x80\x9cBy George, you\xe2\x80\x99re a dead game sport, you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed; and as she began once more to move away, he broke out\r\nsuddenly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lily\xe2\x80\x94stop. You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe those stories\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve they were all got up by a woman who didn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to\r\nsacrifice you to her own convenience\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily drew away with a movement of quick disdain: it was easier to\r\nendure his insolence than his commiseration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we need discuss the matter\r\nfarther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s natural imperviousness to hints made it easy for him\r\nto brush such resistance aside. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to discuss anything;\r\nI just want to put a plain case before you,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted.\r\n\r\nShe paused in spite of herself, held by the note of a new purpose\r\nin his look and tone; and he went on, keeping his eyes firmly\r\nupon her: \xe2\x80\x9cThe wonder to me is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve waited so long to get\r\nsquare with that woman, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve had the power in your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe continued silent under the rush of astonishment that his\r\nwords produced, and he moved a step closer to ask with low-toned\r\ndirectness: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you use those letters of hers you bought\r\nlast year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily stood speechless under the shock of the interrogation. In the\r\nwords preceding it she had conjectured, at most, an allusion to\r\nher supposed influence over George Dorset; nor did the astonishing\r\nindelicacy of the reference diminish the likelihood of Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresorting to it. But now she saw how far short of the mark she had\r\nfallen; and the surprise of learning that he had discovered the\r\nsecret of the letters left her, for the moment, unconscious of the\r\nspecial use to which he was in the act of putting his knowledge.\r\n\r\nHer temporary loss of self-possession gave him time to press his\r\npoint; and he went on quickly, as though to secure completer\r\ncontrol of the situation: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I know where you stand\xe2\x80\x94I know\r\nhow completely she\xe2\x80\x99s in your power. That sounds like stage-talk,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x94but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of truth in some of those old gags;\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you bought those letters simply because you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncollecting autographs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe continued to look at him with a deepening bewilderment: her\r\nonly clear impression resolved itself into a scared sense of his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wondering how I found out about \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, answering\r\nher look with a note of conscious pride. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten\r\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m the owner of the Benedick\xe2\x80\x94but never mind about that now.\r\nGetting on to things is a mighty useful accomplishment in business,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ve simply extended it to my private affairs. For this IS\r\npartly my affair, you see\xe2\x80\x94at least, it depends on you to make it\r\nso. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look the situation straight in the eye. Mrs. Dorset, for\r\nreasons we needn\xe2\x80\x99t go into, did you a beastly bad turn last spring.\r\nEverybody knows what Mrs. Dorset is, and her best friends wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve her on oath where their own interests were concerned; but\r\nas long as they\xe2\x80\x99re out of the row it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to follow her\r\nlead than to set themselves against it, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve simply been\r\nsacrificed to their laziness and selfishness. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a pretty\r\nfair statement of the case?\xe2\x80\x94Well, some people say you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the\r\nneatest kind of an answer in your hands: that George Dorset would\r\nmarry you tomorrow, if you\xe2\x80\x99d tell him all you know, and give him\r\nthe chance to show the lady the door. I daresay he would; but you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care for that particular form of getting even, and,\r\ntaking a purely business view of the question, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nright. In a deal like that, nobody comes out with perfectly clean\r\nhands, and the only way for you to start fresh is to get Bertha\r\nDorset to back you up, instead of trying to fight her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused long enough to draw breath, but not to give her time\r\nfor the expression of her gathering resistance; and as he pressed\r\non, expounding and elucidating his idea with the directness of\r\nthe man who has no doubts of his cause, she found the indignation\r\ngradually freezing on her lip, found herself held fast in the grasp\r\nof his argument by the mere cold strength of its presentation.\r\nThere was no time now to wonder how he had heard of her obtaining\r\nthe letters: all her world was dark outside the monstrous glare\r\nof his scheme for using them. And it was not, after the first\r\nmoment, the horror of the idea that held her spell-bound, subdued\r\nto his will; it was rather its subtle affinity to her own inmost\r\ncravings. He would marry her tomorrow if she could regain Bertha\r\nDorset\xe2\x80\x99s friendship; and to induce the open resumption of that\r\nfriendship, and the tacit retractation of all that had caused its\r\nwithdrawal, she had only to put to the lady the latent menace\r\ncontained in the packet so miraculously delivered into her hands.\r\nLily saw in a flash the advantage of this course over that which\r\npoor Dorset had pressed upon her. The other plan depended for its\r\nsuccess on the infliction of an open injury, while this reduced\r\nthe transaction to a private understanding, of which no third\r\nperson need have the remotest hint. Put by Rosedale in terms of\r\nbusinesslike give-and-take, this understanding took on the harmless\r\nair of a mutual accommodation, like a transfer of property or a\r\nrevision of boundary lines. It certainly simplified life to view it\r\nas a perpetual adjustment, a play of party politics, in which every\r\nconcession had its recognized equivalent: Lily\xe2\x80\x99s tired mind was\r\nfascinated by this escape from fluctuating ethical estimates into a\r\nregion of concrete weights and measures.\r\n\r\nRosedale, as she listened, seemed to read in her silence not only\r\na gradual acquiescence in his plan, but a dangerously far-reaching\r\nperception of the chances it offered; for as she continued to stand\r\nbefore him without speaking, he broke out, with a quick return\r\nupon himself: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see how simple it is, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ncarried away by the idea that it\xe2\x80\x99s TOO simple. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly\r\nas if you\xe2\x80\x99d started in with a clean bill of health. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ntalking let\xe2\x80\x99s call things by their right names, and clear the whole\r\nbusiness up. You know well enough that Bertha Dorset couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\ntouched you if there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94questions asked before\xe2\x80\x94little\r\npoints of interrogation, eh? Bound to happen to a good-looking girl\r\nwith stingy relatives, I suppose; anyhow, they DID happen, and she\r\nfound the ground prepared for her. Do you see where I\xe2\x80\x99m coming out?\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want these little questions cropping up again. It\xe2\x80\x99s one\r\nthing to get Bertha Dorset into line\xe2\x80\x94but what you want is to keep\r\nher there. You can frighten her fast enough\xe2\x80\x94but how are you going\r\nto keep her frightened? By showing her that you\xe2\x80\x99re as powerful as\r\nshe is. All the letters in the world won\xe2\x80\x99t do that for you as you\r\nare now; but with a big backing behind you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep her just\r\nwhere you want her to be. That\xe2\x80\x99s MY share in the business\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m offering you. You can\xe2\x80\x99t put the thing through without\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t run away with any idea that you can. In six months you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbe back again among your old worries, or worse ones; and here I am,\r\nready to lift you out of \xe2\x80\x99em tomorrow if you say so. DO you say so,\r\nMiss Lily?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, moving suddenly nearer.\r\n\r\nThe words, and the movement which accompanied them, combined to\r\nstartle Lily out of the state of tranced subservience into which\r\nshe had insensibly slipped. Light comes in devious ways to the\r\ngroping consciousness, and it came to her now through the disgusted\r\nperception that her would-be accomplice assumed, as a matter of\r\ncourse, the likelihood of her distrusting him and perhaps trying\r\nto cheat him of his share of the spoils. This glimpse of his inner\r\nmind seemed to present the whole transaction in a new aspect, and\r\nshe saw that the essential baseness of the act lay in its freedom\r\nfrom risk.\r\n\r\nShe drew back with a quick gesture of rejection, saying, in a\r\nvoice that was a surprise to her own ears: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken\xe2\x80\x94quite\r\nmistaken\xe2\x80\x94both in the facts and in what you infer from them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosedale stared a moment, puzzled by her sudden dash in a direction\r\nso different from that toward which she had appeared to be letting\r\nhim guide her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what on earth does that mean? I thought we understood each\r\nother!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; and to her murmur of \xe2\x80\x9cAh, we do NOW,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nretorted with a sudden burst of violence: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s because\r\nthe letters are to HIM, then? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned if I see what\r\nthanks you\xe2\x80\x99ve got from him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn days declined to winter. Once more the leisure world was\r\nin transition between country and town, and Fifth Avenue, still\r\ndeserted at the week-end, showed from Monday to Friday a broadening\r\nstream of carriages between house-fronts gradually restored to\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe Horse Show, some two weeks earlier, had produced a passing\r\nsemblance of reanimation, filling the theatres and restaurants\r\nwith a human display of the same costly and high-stepping kind as\r\ncircled daily about its ring. In Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s world the Horse Show,\r\nand the public it attracted, had ostensibly come to be classed\r\namong the spectacles disdained of the elect; but, as the feudal\r\nlord might sally forth to join in the dance on his village green,\r\nso society, unofficially and incidentally, still condescended\r\nto look in upon the scene. Mrs. Gormer, among the rest, was not\r\nabove seizing such an occasion for the display of herself and her\r\nhorses; and Lily was given one or two opportunities of appearing at\r\nher friend\xe2\x80\x99s side in the most conspicuous box the house afforded.\r\nBut this lingering semblance of intimacy made her only the more\r\nconscious of a change in the relation between Mattie and herself,\r\nof a dawning discrimination, a gradually formed social standard,\r\nemerging from Mrs. Gormer\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic view of life. It was inevitable\r\nthat Lily herself should constitute the first sacrifice to this\r\nnew ideal, and she knew that, once the Gormers were established in\r\ntown, the whole drift of fashionable life would facilitate Mattie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetachment from her. She had, in short, failed to make herself\r\nindispensable; or rather, her attempt to do so had been thwarted by\r\nan influence stronger than any she could exert. That influence, in\r\nits last analysis, was simply the power of money: Bertha Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsocial credit was based on an impregnable bank-account.\r\n\r\nLily knew that Rosedale had overstated neither the difficulty\r\nof her own position nor the completeness of the vindication he\r\noffered: once Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s match in material resources, her superior\r\ngifts would make it easy for her to dominate her adversary. An\r\nunderstanding of what such domination would mean, and of the\r\ndisadvantages accruing from her rejection of it, was brought home\r\nto Lily with increasing clearness during the early weeks of the\r\nwinter. Hitherto, she had kept up a semblance of movement outside\r\nthe main flow of the social current; but with the return to town,\r\nand the concentrating of scattered activities, the mere fact of\r\nnot slipping back naturally into her old habits of life marked\r\nher as being unmistakably excluded from them. If one were not a\r\npart of the season\xe2\x80\x99s fixed routine, one swung unsphered in a void\r\nof social non-existence. Lily, for all her dissatisfied dreaming,\r\nhad never really conceived the possibility of revolving about a\r\ndifferent centre: it was easy enough to despise the world, but\r\ndecidedly difficult to find any other habitable region. Her sense\r\nof irony never quite deserted her, and she could still note, with\r\nself-directed derision, the abnormal value suddenly acquired by the\r\nmost tiresome and insignificant details of her former life. Its\r\nvery drudgeries had a charm now that she was involuntarily released\r\nfrom them: card-leaving, note-writing, enforced civilities to the\r\ndull and elderly, and the smiling endurance of tedious dinners\xe2\x80\x94how\r\npleasantly such obligations would have filled the emptiness of her\r\ndays! She did indeed leave cards in plenty; she kept herself, with\r\na smiling and valiant persistence, well in the eye of her world;\r\nnor did she suffer any of those gross rebuffs which sometimes\r\nproduce a wholesome reaction of contempt in their victim. Society\r\ndid not turn away from her, it simply drifted by, preoccupied and\r\ninattentive, letting her feel, to the full measure of her humbled\r\npride, how completely she had been the creature of its favour.\r\n\r\nShe had rejected Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion with a promptness of scorn\r\nalmost surprising to herself: she had not lost her capacity for\r\nhigh flashes of indignation. But she could not breathe long on the\r\nheights; there had been nothing in her training to develop any\r\ncontinuity of moral strength: what she craved, and really felt\r\nherself entitled to, was a situation in which the noblest attitude\r\nshould also be the easiest. Hitherto her intermittent impulses\r\nof resistance had sufficed to maintain her self-respect. If she\r\nslipped she recovered her footing, and it was only afterward that\r\nshe was aware of having recovered it each time on a slightly lower\r\nlevel. She had rejected Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s offer without conscious effort;\r\nher whole being had risen against it; and she did not yet perceive\r\nthat, by the mere act of listening to him, she had learned to live\r\nwith ideas which would once have been intolerable to her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Gerty Farish, keeping watch over her with a tenderer if less\r\ndiscerning eye than Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s, the results of the struggle were\r\nalready distinctly visible. She did not, indeed, know what hostages\r\nLily had already given to expediency; but she saw her passionately\r\nand irretrievably pledged to the ruinous policy of \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGerty could smile now at her own early dream of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrenovation through adversity: she understood clearly enough that\r\nLily was not of those to whom privation teaches the unimportance of\r\nwhat they have lost. But this very fact, to Gerty, made her friend\r\nthe more piteously in want of aid, the more exposed to the claims\r\nof a tenderness she was so little conscious of needing.\r\n\r\nLily, since her return to town, had not often climbed Miss\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s stairs. There was something irritating to her in the\r\nmute interrogation of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy: she felt the real\r\ndifficulties of her situation to be incommunicable to any one\r\nwhose theory of values was so different from her own, and the\r\nrestrictions of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s life, which had once had the charm of\r\ncontrast, now reminded her too painfully of the limits to which\r\nher own existence was shrinking. When at length, one afternoon,\r\nshe put into execution the belated resolve to visit her friend,\r\nthis sense of shrunken opportunities possessed her with unusual\r\nintensity. The walk up Fifth Avenue, unfolding before her, in the\r\nbrilliance of the hard winter sunlight, an interminable procession\r\nof fastidiously-equipped carriages\xe2\x80\x94giving her, through the little\r\nsquares of brougham-windows, peeps of familiar profiles bent above\r\nvisiting-lists, of hurried hands dispensing notes and cards to\r\nattendant footmen\xe2\x80\x94this glimpse of the ever-revolving wheels of the\r\ngreat social machine made Lily more than ever conscious of the\r\nsteepness and narrowness of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s stairs, and of the cramped\r\nblind alley of life to which they led. Dull stairs destined to\r\nbe mounted by dull people: how many thousands of insignificant\r\nfigures were going up and down such stairs all over the world at\r\nthat very moment\xe2\x80\x94figures as shabby and uninteresting as that of the\r\nmiddle-aged lady in limp black who descended Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s flight as Lily\r\nclimbed to it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was poor Miss Jane Silverton\xe2\x80\x94she came to talk things over\r\nwith me: she and her sister want to do something to support\r\nthemselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty explained, as Lily followed her into the\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo support themselves? Are they so hard up?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart asked with\r\na touch of irritation: she had not come to listen to the woes of\r\nother people.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid they have nothing left: Ned\xe2\x80\x99s debts have swallowed\r\nup everything. They had such hopes, you know, when he broke away\r\nfrom Carry Fisher; they thought Bertha Dorset would be such a good\r\ninfluence, because she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care for cards, and\xe2\x80\x94well, she talked\r\nquite beautifully to poor Miss Jane about feeling as if Ned were\r\nher younger brother, and wanting to carry him off on the yacht, so\r\nthat he might have a chance to drop cards and racing, and take up\r\nhis literary work again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Farish paused with a sigh which reflected the perplexity of\r\nher departing visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that isn\xe2\x80\x99t all; it isn\xe2\x80\x99t even the\r\nworst. It seems that Ned has quarrelled with the Dorsets; or at\r\nleast Bertha won\xe2\x80\x99t allow him to see her, and he is so unhappy about\r\nit that he has taken to gambling again, and going about with all\r\nsorts of queer people. And cousin Grace Van Osburgh accuses him of\r\nhaving had a very bad influence on Freddy, who left Harvard last\r\nspring, and has been a great deal with Ned ever since. She sent\r\nfor Miss Jane, and made a dreadful scene; and Jack Stepney and\r\nHerbert Melson, who were there too, told Miss Jane that Freddy was\r\nthreatening to marry some dreadful woman to whom Ned had introduced\r\nhim, and that they could do nothing with him because now he\xe2\x80\x99s of\r\nage he has his own money. You can fancy how poor Miss Jane felt\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ncame to me at once, and seemed to think that if I could get her\r\nsomething to do she could earn enough to pay Ned\xe2\x80\x99s debts and send\r\nhim away\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid she has no idea how long it would take her to\r\npay for one of his evenings at bridge. And he was horribly in debt\r\nwhen he came back from the cruise\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t see why he should have\r\nspent so much more money under Bertha\xe2\x80\x99s influence than Carry\xe2\x80\x99s: can\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily met this query with an impatient gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Gerty, I\r\nalways understand how people can spend much more money\xe2\x80\x94never how\r\nthey can spend any less!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe loosened her furs and settled herself in Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s easy-chair,\r\nwhile her friend busied herself with the tea-cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can they do\xe2\x80\x94the Miss Silvertons? How do they mean\r\nto support themselves?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, conscious that the note of\r\nirritation still persisted in her voice. It was the very last\r\ntopic she had meant to discuss\xe2\x80\x94it really did not interest her in\r\nthe least\xe2\x80\x94but she was seized by a sudden perverse curiosity to\r\nknow how the two colourless shrinking victims of young Silverton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsentimental experiments meant to cope with the grim necessity which\r\nlurked so close to her own threshold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I am trying to find something for them. Miss Jane\r\nreads aloud very nicely\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s so hard to find any one who is\r\nwilling to be read to. And Miss Annie paints a little\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know\xe2\x80\x94apple-blossoms on blotting-paper; just the kind of\r\nthing I shall be doing myself before long!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lily,\r\nstarting up with a vehemence of movement that threatened\r\ndestruction to Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s fragile tea-table.\r\n\r\nLily bent over to steady the cups; then she sank back into her\r\nseat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten there was no room to dash about in\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nbeautifully one does have to behave in a small flat! Oh, Gerty, I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be good,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed out incoherently.\r\n\r\nGerty lifted an apprehensive look to her pale face, in which the\r\neyes shone with a peculiar sleepless lustre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look horribly tired, Lily; take your tea, and let me give you\r\nthis cushion to lean against.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart accepted the cup of tea, but put back the cushion with an\r\nimpatient hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give me that! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lean back\xe2\x80\x94I shall go to sleep\r\nif I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not, dear? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be as quiet as a mouse,\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty urged\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no; don\xe2\x80\x99t be quiet; talk to me\xe2\x80\x94keep me awake! I don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep at\r\nnight, and in the afternoon a dreadful drowsiness creeps over me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep at night? Since when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d She rose and put the empty cup on\r\nthe tea-tray. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother, and stronger, please; if I don\xe2\x80\x99t keep awake\r\nnow I shall see horrors tonight\xe2\x80\x94perfect horrors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse if you drink too much tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94give it to me; and don\xe2\x80\x99t preach, please,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily returned\r\nimperiously. Her voice had a dangerous edge, and Gerty noticed that\r\nher hand shook as she held it out to receive the second cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you look so tired: I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you must be ill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart set down her cup with a start. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I look ill? Does my\r\nface show it?\xe2\x80\x9d She rose and walked quickly toward the little mirror\r\nabove the writing-table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a horrid looking-glass\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nblotched and discoloured. Any one would look ghastly in it!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nturned back, fixing her plaintive eyes on Gerty. \xe2\x80\x9cYou stupid dear,\r\nwhy do you say such odious things to me? It\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make one\r\nill to be told one looks so! And looking ill means looking ugly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nShe caught Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s wrists, and drew her close to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\r\nall, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather know the truth. Look me straight in the face,\r\nGerty, and tell me: am I perfectly frightful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly beautiful now, Lily: your eyes are shining, and\r\nyour cheeks have grown so pink all of a sudden\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, they WERE pale, then\xe2\x80\x94ghastly pale, when I came in? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou tell me frankly that I\xe2\x80\x99m a wreck? My eyes are bright now\r\nbecause I\xe2\x80\x99m so nervous\xe2\x80\x94but in the mornings they look like lead.\r\nAnd I can see the lines coming in my face\xe2\x80\x94the lines of worry and\r\ndisappointment and failure! Every sleepless night leaves a new\r\none\xe2\x80\x94and how can I sleep, when I have such dreadful things to think\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreadful things\xe2\x80\x94what things?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gerty, gently detaching her\r\nwrists from her friend\xe2\x80\x99s feverish fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat things? Well, poverty, for one\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore dreadful.\xe2\x80\x9d Lily turned away and sank with sudden weariness\r\ninto the easy-chair near the tea-table. \xe2\x80\x9cYou asked me just now if I\r\ncould understand why Ned Silverton spent so much money. Of course I\r\nunderstand\xe2\x80\x94he spends it on living with the rich. You think we live\r\nON the rich, rather than with them: and so we do, in a sense\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a privilege we have to pay for! We eat their dinners, and\r\ndrink their wine, and smoke their cigarettes, and use their\r\ncarriages and their opera-boxes and their private cars\xe2\x80\x94yes, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a tax to pay on every one of those luxuries. The man pays\r\nit by big tips to the servants, by playing cards beyond his means,\r\nby flowers and presents\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94lots of other things that cost;\r\nthe girl pays it by tips and cards too\xe2\x80\x94oh, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to take\r\nup bridge again\xe2\x80\x94and by going to the best dress-makers, and having\r\njust the right dress for every occasion, and always keeping herself\r\nfresh and exquisite and amusing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe leaned back for a moment, closing her eyes, and as she sat\r\nthere, her pale lips slightly parted, and the lids dropped above\r\nher fagged brilliant gaze, Gerty had a startled perception of the\r\nchange in her face\xe2\x80\x94of the way in which an ashen daylight seemed\r\nsuddenly to extinguish its artificial brightness. She looked up,\r\nand the vision vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very amusing, does it? And it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sick to\r\ndeath of it! And yet the thought of giving it all up nearly kills\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s what keeps me awake at night, and makes me so crazy for\r\nyour strong tea. For I can\xe2\x80\x99t go on in this way much longer, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m nearly at the end of my tether. And then what can I do\xe2\x80\x94how\r\non earth am I to keep myself alive? I see myself reduced to the\r\nfate of that poor Silverton woman\xe2\x80\x94slinking about to employment\r\nagencies, and trying to sell painted blotting-pads to Women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nExchanges! And there are thousands and thousands of women trying to\r\ndo the same thing already, and not one of the number who has less\r\nidea how to earn a dollar than I have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose again with a hurried glance at the clock. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s late, and\r\nI must be off\xe2\x80\x94I have an appointment with Carry Fisher. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nso worried, you dear thing\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t think too much about the nonsense\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking.\xe2\x80\x9d She was before the mirror again, adjusting\r\nher hair with a light hand, drawing down her veil, and giving a\r\ndexterous touch to her furs. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you know, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nto the employment agencies and the painted blotting-pads yet;\r\nbut I\xe2\x80\x99m rather hard up just for the moment, and if I could find\r\nsomething to do\xe2\x80\x94notes to write and visiting-lists to make up, or\r\nthat kind of thing\xe2\x80\x94it would tide me over till the legacy is paid.\r\nAnd Carry has promised to find somebody who wants a kind of social\r\nsecretary\xe2\x80\x94you know she makes a specialty of the helpless rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Bart had not revealed to Gerty the full extent of her anxiety.\r\nShe was in fact in urgent and immediate need of money: money to\r\nmeet the vulgar weekly claims which could neither be deferred nor\r\nevaded. To give up her apartment, and shrink to the obscurity of a\r\nboarding-house, or the provisional hospitality of a bed in Gerty\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room, was an expedient which could only postpone\r\nthe problem confronting her; and it seemed wiser as well as more\r\nagreeable to remain where she was and find some means of earning\r\nher living. The possibility of having to do this was one which she\r\nhad never before seriously considered, and the discovery that, as a\r\nbread-winner, she was likely to prove as helpless and ineffectual\r\nas poor Miss Silverton, was a severe shock to her self-confidence.\r\n\r\nHaving been accustomed to take herself at the popular valuation,\r\nas a person of energy and resource, naturally fitted to dominate\r\nany situation in which she found herself, she vaguely imagined that\r\nsuch gifts would be of value to seekers after social guidance;\r\nbut there was unfortunately no specific head under which the\r\nart of saying and doing the right thing could be offered in the\r\nmarket, and even Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s resourcefulness failed before the\r\ndifficulty of discovering a workable vein in the vague wealth of\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s graces. Mrs. Fisher was full of indirect expedients for\r\nenabling her friends to earn a living, and could conscientiously\r\nassert that she had put several opportunities of this kind before\r\nLily; but more legitimate methods of bread-winning were as much out\r\nof her line as they were beyond the capacity of the sufferers she\r\nwas generally called upon to assist. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s failure to profit by\r\nthe chances already afforded her might, moreover, have justified\r\nthe abandonment of farther effort on her behalf; but Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninexhaustible good-nature made her an adept at creating artificial\r\ndemands in response to an actual supply. In the pursuance of this\r\nend she at once started on a voyage of discovery in Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehalf; and as the result of her explorations she now summoned the\r\nlatter with the announcement that she had \xe2\x80\x9cfound something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeft to herself, Gerty mused distressfully upon her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplight, and her own inability to relieve it. It was clear to her\r\nthat Lily, for the present, had no wish for the kind of help she\r\ncould give. Miss Farish could see no hope for her friend but in a\r\nlife completely reorganized and detached from its old associations;\r\nwhereas all Lily\xe2\x80\x99s energies were centred in the determined effort\r\nto hold fast to those associations, to keep herself visibly\r\nidentified with them, as long as the illusion could be maintained.\r\nPitiable as such an attitude seemed to Gerty, she could not judge\r\nit as harshly as Selden, for instance, might have done. She had\r\nnot forgotten the night of emotion when she and Lily had lain in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and she had seemed to feel her very heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood passing into her friend. The sacrifice she had made had\r\nseemed unavailing enough; no trace remained in Lily of the subduing\r\ninfluences of that hour; but Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s tenderness, disciplined by\r\nlong years of contact with obscure and inarticulate suffering,\r\ncould wait on its object with a silent forbearance which took no\r\naccount of time. She could not, however, deny herself the solace of\r\ntaking anxious counsel with Lawrence Selden, with whom, since his\r\nreturn from Europe, she had renewed her old relation of cousinly\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nSelden himself had never been aware of any change in their\r\nrelation. He found Gerty as he had left her, simple, undemanding\r\nand devoted, but with a quickened intelligence of the heart which\r\nhe recognized without seeking to explain it. To Gerty herself it\r\nwould once have seemed impossible that she should ever again talk\r\nfreely with him of Lily Bart; but what had passed in the secrecy\r\nof her own breast seemed to resolve itself, when the mist of the\r\nstruggle cleared, into a breaking down of the bounds of self, a\r\ndeflecting of the wasted personal emotion into the general current\r\nof human understanding.\r\n\r\nIt was not till some two weeks after her visit from Lily that\r\nGerty had the opportunity of communicating her fears to Selden.\r\nThe latter, having presented himself on a Sunday afternoon, had\r\nlingered on through the dowdy animation of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s tea-hour,\r\nconscious of something in her voice and eye which solicited a word\r\napart; and as soon as the last visitor was gone Gerty opened her\r\ncase by asking how lately he had seen Miss Bart.\r\n\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s perceptible pause gave her time for a slight stir of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her at all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve perpetually missed seeing her since\r\nshe came back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis unexpected admission made Gerty pause too; and she was still\r\nhesitating on the brink of her subject when he relieved her by\r\nadding: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to see her\xe2\x80\x94but she seems to have been absorbed\r\nby the Gormer set since her return from Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason: she\xe2\x80\x99s been very unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappy at being with the Gormers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t defend her intimacy with the Gormers; but that too is\r\nat an end now, I think. You know people have been very unkind since\r\nBertha Dorset quarrelled with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Selden exclaimed, rising abruptly to walk to the window,\r\nwhere he remained with his eyes on the darkening street while\r\nhis cousin continued to explain: \xe2\x80\x9cJudy Trenor and her own family\r\nhave deserted her too\xe2\x80\x94and all because Bertha Dorset has said such\r\nhorrible things. And she is very poor\xe2\x80\x94you know Mrs. Peniston cut\r\nher off with a small legacy, after giving her to understand that\r\nshe was to have everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden assented curtly, turning back into the room,\r\nbut only to stir about with restless steps in the circumscribed\r\nspace between door and window. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s been abominably treated;\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunately the precise thing that a man who wants to\r\nshow his sympathy can\xe2\x80\x99t say to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis words caused Gerty a slight chill of disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nwould be other ways of showing your sympathy,\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested.\r\n\r\nSelden, with a slight laugh, sat down beside her on the little sofa\r\nwhich projected from the hearth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of, you\r\nincorrigible missionary?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s colour rose, and her blush was for a moment her only\r\nanswer. Then she made it more explicit by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking of\r\nthe fact that you and she used to be great friends\xe2\x80\x94that she used to\r\ncare immensely for what you thought of her\xe2\x80\x94and that, if she takes\r\nyour staying away as a sign of what you think now, I can imagine\r\nits adding a great deal to her unhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, don\xe2\x80\x99t add to it still more\xe2\x80\x94at least to\r\nyour conception of it\xe2\x80\x94by attributing to her all sorts of\r\nsusceptibilities of your own.\xe2\x80\x9d Selden, for his life, could not\r\nkeep a note of dryness out of his voice; but he met Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s look\r\nof perplexity by saying more mildly: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, though you immensely\r\nexaggerate the importance of anything I could do for Miss Bart, you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate my readiness to do it\xe2\x80\x94if you ask me to.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid\r\nhis hand for a moment on hers, and there passed between them, on\r\nthe current of the rare contact, one of those exchanges of meaning\r\nwhich fill the hidden reservoirs of affection. Gerty had the\r\nfeeling that he measured the cost of her request as plainly as she\r\nread the significance of his reply; and the sense of all that was\r\nsuddenly clear between them made her next words easier to find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do ask you, then; I ask you because she once told me that you\r\nhad been a help to her, and because she needs help now as she has\r\nnever needed it before. You know how dependent she has always been\r\non ease and luxury\xe2\x80\x94how she has hated what was shabby and ugly and\r\nuncomfortable. She can\xe2\x80\x99t help it\xe2\x80\x94she was brought up with those\r\nideas, and has never been able to find her way out of them. But\r\nnow all the things she cared for have been taken from her, and the\r\npeople who taught her to care for them have abandoned her too; and\r\nit seems to me that if some one could reach out a hand and show her\r\nthe other side\xe2\x80\x94show her how much is left in life and in herself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGerty broke off, abashed at the sound of her own eloquence, and\r\nimpeded by the difficulty of giving precise expression to her vague\r\nyearning for her friend\xe2\x80\x99s retrieval. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help her myself:\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s passed out of my reach,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s afraid\r\nof being a burden to me. When she was last here, two weeks ago, she\r\nseemed dreadfully worried about her future: she said Carry Fisher\r\nwas trying to find something for her to do. A few days later she\r\nwrote me that she had taken a position as private secretary, and\r\nthat I was not to be anxious, for everything was all right, and\r\nshe would come in and tell me about it when she had time; but she\r\nhas never come, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to go to her, because I am afraid\r\nof forcing myself on her when I\xe2\x80\x99m not wanted. Once, when we were\r\nchildren, and I had rushed up after a long separation, and thrown\r\nmy arms about her, she said: \xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t kiss me unless I ask you\r\nto, Gerty\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and she DID ask me, a minute later; but since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nalways waited to be asked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden had listened in silence, with the concentrated look which\r\nhis thin dark face could assume when he wished to guard it against\r\nany involuntary change of expression. When his cousin ended, he\r\nsaid with a slight smile: \xe2\x80\x9cSince you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned the wisdom of\r\nwaiting, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you urge me to rush in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but the troubled\r\nappeal of her eyes made him add, as he rose to take leave: \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do what you wish, and not hold you responsible for my failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s avoidance of Miss Bart had not been as unintentional as he\r\nhad allowed his cousin to think. At first, indeed, while the memory\r\nof their last hour at Monte Carlo still held the full heat of his\r\nindignation, he had anxiously watched for her return; but she had\r\ndisappointed him by lingering in England, and when she finally\r\nreappeared it happened that business had called him to the West,\r\nwhence he came back only to learn that she was starting for Alaska\r\nwith the Gormers. The revelation of this suddenly-established\r\nintimacy effectually chilled his desire to see her. If, at a moment\r\nwhen her whole life seemed to be breaking up, she could cheerfully\r\ncommit its reconstruction to the Gormers, there was no reason why\r\nsuch accidents should ever strike her as irreparable. Every step\r\nshe took seemed in fact to carry her farther from the region where,\r\nonce or twice, he and she had met for an illumined moment; and the\r\nrecognition of this fact, when its first pang had been surmounted,\r\nproduced in him a sense of negative relief. It was much simpler for\r\nhim to judge Miss Bart by her habitual conduct than by the rare\r\ndeviations from it which had thrown her so disturbingly in his way;\r\nand every act of hers which made the recurrence of such deviations\r\nmore unlikely, confirmed the sense of relief with which he returned\r\nto the conventional view of her.\r\n\r\nBut Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s words had sufficed to make him see how little\r\nthis view was really his, and how impossible it was for him to live\r\nquietly with the thought of Lily Bart. To hear that she was in\r\nneed of help\xe2\x80\x94even such vague help as he could offer\xe2\x80\x94was to be at\r\nonce repossessed by that thought; and by the time he reached the\r\nstreet he had sufficiently convinced himself of the urgency of his\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to turn his steps directly toward Lily\xe2\x80\x99s hotel.\r\n\r\nThere his zeal met a check in the unforeseen news that Miss Bart\r\nhad moved away; but, on his pressing his enquiries, the clerk\r\nremembered that she had left an address, for which he presently\r\nbegan to search through his books.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly strange that she should have taken this step\r\nwithout letting Gerty Farish know of her decision; and Selden\r\nwaited with a vague sense of uneasiness while the address was\r\nsought for. The process lasted long enough for uneasiness to turn\r\nto apprehension; but when at length a slip of paper was handed him,\r\nand he read on it: \xe2\x80\x9cCare of Mrs. Norma Hatch, Emporium Hotel,\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\napprehension passed into an incredulous stare, and this into the\r\ngesture of disgust with which he tore the paper in two, and turned\r\nto walk quickly homeward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lily woke on the morning after her translation to the Emporium\r\nHotel, her first feeling was one of purely physical satisfaction.\r\nThe force of contrast gave an added keenness to the luxury of lying\r\nonce more in a soft-pillowed bed, and looking across a spacious\r\nsunlit room at a breakfast-table set invitingly near the fire.\r\nAnalysis and introspection might come later; but for the moment\r\nshe was not even troubled by the excesses of the upholstery or\r\nthe restless convolutions of the furniture. The sense of being\r\nonce more lapped and folded in ease, as in some dense mild medium\r\nimpenetrable to discomfort, effectually stilled the faintest note\r\nof criticism.\r\n\r\nWhen, the afternoon before, she had presented herself to the lady\r\nto whom Carry Fisher had directed her, she had been conscious of\r\nentering a new world. Carry\xe2\x80\x99s vague presentment of Mrs. Norma\r\nHatch (whose reversion to her Christian name was explained as the\r\nresult of her latest divorce), left her under the implication\r\nof coming \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the West,\xe2\x80\x9d with the not unusual extenuation of\r\nhaving brought a great deal of money with her. She was, in short,\r\nrich, helpless, unplaced: the very subject for Lily\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Mrs.\r\nFisher had not specified the line her friend was to take; she\r\nowned herself unacquainted with Mrs. Hatch, whom she \xe2\x80\x9cknew about\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthrough Melville Stancy, a lawyer in his leisure moments, and the\r\nFalstaff of a certain section of festive club life. Socially, Mr.\r\nStancy might have been said to form a connecting link between the\r\nGormer world and the more dimly-lit region on which Miss Bart\r\nnow found herself entering. It was, however, only figuratively\r\nthat the illumination of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s world could be described as\r\ndim: in actual fact, Lily found her seated in a blaze of electric\r\nlight, impartially projected from various ornamental excrescences\r\non a vast concavity of pink damask and gilding, from which she\r\nrose like Venus from her shell. The analogy was justified by the\r\nappearance of the lady, whose large-eyed prettiness had the fixity\r\nof something impaled and shown under glass. This did not preclude\r\nthe immediate discovery that she was some years younger than her\r\nvisitor, and that under her showiness, her ease, the aggression of\r\nher dress and voice, there persisted that ineradicable innocence\r\nwhich, in ladies of her nationality, so curiously coexists with\r\nstartling extremes of experience.\r\n\r\nThe environment in which Lily found herself was as strange to her\r\nas its inhabitants. She was unacquainted with the world of the\r\nfashionable New York hotel\xe2\x80\x94a world over-heated, over-upholstered,\r\nand over-fitted with mechanical appliances for the gratification\r\nof fantastic requirements, while the comforts of a civilized life\r\nwere as unattainable as in a desert. Through this atmosphere of\r\ntorrid splendour moved wan beings as richly upholstered as the\r\nfurniture, beings without definite pursuits or permanent relations,\r\nwho drifted on a languid tide of curiosity from restaurant to\r\nconcert-hall, from palm-garden to music-room, from \xe2\x80\x9cart exhibit\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\ndress-maker\xe2\x80\x99s opening. High-stepping horses or elaborately equipped\r\nmotors waited to carry these ladies into vague metropolitan\r\ndistances, whence they returned, still more wan from the weight of\r\ntheir sables, to be sucked back into the stifling inertia of the\r\nhotel routine. Somewhere behind them, in the background of their\r\nlives, there was doubtless a real past, peopled by real human\r\nactivities: they themselves were probably the product of strong\r\nambitions, persistent energies, diversified contacts with the\r\nwholesome roughness of life; yet they had no more real existence\r\nthan the poet\xe2\x80\x99s shades in limbo.\r\n\r\nLily had not been long in this pallid world without discovering\r\nthat Mrs. Hatch was its most substantial figure. That lady, though\r\nstill floating in the void, showed faint symptoms of developing\r\nan outline; and in this endeavour she was actively seconded by\r\nMr. Melville Stancy. It was Mr. Stancy, a man of large resounding\r\npresence, suggestive of convivial occasions and of a chivalry\r\nfinding expression in \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-night\xe2\x80\x9d boxes and thousand dollar\r\nbonbonnieres, who had transplanted Mrs. Hatch from the scene of\r\nher first development to the higher stage of hotel life in the\r\nmetropolis. It was he who had selected the horses with which she\r\nhad taken the blue ribbon at the Show, had introduced her to the\r\nphotographer whose portraits of her formed the recurring ornament\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cSunday Supplements,\xe2\x80\x9d and had got together the group which\r\nconstituted her social world. It was a small group still, with\r\nheterogeneous figures suspended in large unpeopled spaces; but Lily\r\ndid not take long to learn that its regulation was no longer in Mr.\r\nStancy\xe2\x80\x99s hands. As often happens, the pupil had outstripped the\r\nteacher, and Mrs. Hatch was already aware of heights of elegance\r\nas well as depths of luxury beyond the world of the Emporium. This\r\ndiscovery at once produced in her a craving for higher guidance,\r\nfor the adroit feminine hand which should give the right turn\r\nto her correspondence, the right \xe2\x80\x9clook\xe2\x80\x9d to her hats, the right\r\nsuccession to the items of her MENUS. It was, in short, as the\r\nregulator of a germinating social life that Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s guidance\r\nwas required; her ostensible duties as secretary being restricted\r\nby the fact that Mrs. Hatch, as yet, knew hardly any one to write\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe daily details of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s existence were as strange to\r\nLily as its general tenor. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s habits were marked by an\r\nOriental indolence and disorder peculiarly trying to her companion.\r\nMrs. Hatch and her friends seemed to float together outside the\r\nbounds of time and space. No definite hours were kept; no fixed\r\nobligations existed: night and day flowed into one another in a\r\nblur of confused and retarded engagements, so that one had the\r\nimpression of lunching at the tea-hour, while dinner was often\r\nmerged in the noisy after-theatre supper which prolonged Mrs.\r\nHatch\xe2\x80\x99s vigil till daylight.\r\n\r\nThrough this jumble of futile activities came and went a strange\r\nthrong of hangers-on\xe2\x80\x94manicures, beauty-doctors, hair-dressers,\r\nteachers of bridge, of French, of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical development\xe2\x80\x9d: figures\r\nsometimes indistinguishable, by their appearance, or by Mrs.\r\nHatch\xe2\x80\x99s relation to them, from the visitors constituting her\r\nrecognized society. But strangest of all to Lily was the encounter,\r\nin this latter group, of several of her acquaintances. She had\r\nsupposed, and not without relief, that she was passing, for the\r\nmoment, completely out of her own circle; but she found that Mr.\r\nStancy, one side of whose sprawling existence overlapped the\r\nedge of Mrs. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s world, had drawn several of its brightest\r\nornaments into the circle of the Emporium. To find Ned Silverton\r\namong the habitual frequenters of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room\r\nwas one of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s first astonishments; but she soon discovered\r\nthat he was not Mr. Stancy\xe2\x80\x99s most important recruit. It was on\r\nlittle Freddy Van Osburgh, the small slim heir of the Van Osburgh\r\nmillions, that the attention of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s group was centred.\r\nFreddy, barely out of college, had risen above the horizon since\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s eclipse, and she now saw with surprise what an effulgence he\r\nshed on the outer twilight of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s existence. This, then,\r\nwas one of the things that young men \xe2\x80\x9cwent in\xe2\x80\x9d for when released\r\nfrom the official social routine; this was the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cprevious\r\nengagement\xe2\x80\x9d that so frequently caused them to disappoint the hopes\r\nof anxious hostesses. Lily had an odd sense of being behind the\r\nsocial tapestry, on the side where the threads were knotted and\r\nthe loose ends hung. For a moment she found a certain amusement in\r\nthe show, and in her own share of it: the situation had an ease\r\nand unconventionality distinctly refreshing after her experience\r\nof the irony of conventions. But these flashes of amusement were\r\nbut brief reactions from the long disgust of her days. Compared\r\nwith the vast gilded void of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s existence, the life of\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s former friends seemed packed with ordered activities. Even\r\nthe most irresponsible pretty woman of her acquaintance had her\r\ninherited obligations, her conventional benevolences, her share in\r\nthe working of the great civic machine; and all hung together in\r\nthe solidarity of these traditional functions. The performance of\r\nspecific duties would have simplified Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s position; but the\r\nvague attendance on Mrs. Hatch was not without its perplexities.\r\n\r\nIt was not her employer who created these perplexities. Mrs.\r\nHatch showed from the first an almost touching desire for Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napproval. Far from asserting the superiority of wealth, her\r\nbeautiful eyes seemed to urge the plea of inexperience: she wanted\r\nto do what was \xe2\x80\x9cnice,\xe2\x80\x9d to be taught how to be \xe2\x80\x9clovely.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ndifficulty was to find any point of contact between her ideals and\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hatch swam in a haze of indeterminate enthusiasms, of\r\naspirations culled from the stage, the newspapers, the fashion\r\njournals, and a gaudy world of sport still more completely beyond\r\nher companion\xe2\x80\x99s ken. To separate from these confused conceptions\r\nthose most likely to advance the lady on her way, was Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobvious duty; but its performance was hampered by rapidly-growing\r\ndoubts. Lily was in fact becoming more and more aware of a certain\r\nambiguity in her situation. It was not that she had, in the\r\nconventional sense, any doubt of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s irreproachableness.\r\nThe lady\xe2\x80\x99s offences were always against taste rather than conduct;\r\nher divorce record seemed due to geographical rather than ethical\r\nconditions; and her worst laxities were likely to proceed from\r\na wandering and extravagant good-nature. But if Lily did not\r\nmind her detaining her manicure for luncheon, or offering the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeauty-Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d a seat in Freddy Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s box at the play,\r\nshe was not equally at ease in regard to some less apparent lapses\r\nfrom convention. Ned Silverton\xe2\x80\x99s relation to Stancy seemed, for\r\ninstance, closer and less clear than any natural affinities would\r\nwarrant; and both appeared united in the effort to cultivate Freddy\r\nVan Osburgh\xe2\x80\x99s growing taste for Mrs. Hatch. There was as yet\r\nnothing definable in the situation, which might well resolve itself\r\ninto a huge joke on the part of the other two; but Lily had a vague\r\nsense that the subject of their experiment was too young, too rich\r\nand too credulous. Her embarrassment was increased by the fact that\r\nFreddy seemed to regard her as cooperating with himself in the\r\nsocial development of Mrs. Hatch: a view that suggested, on his\r\npart, a permanent interest in the lady\xe2\x80\x99s future. There were moments\r\nwhen Lily found an ironic amusement in this aspect of the case. The\r\nthought of launching such a missile as Mrs. Hatch at the perfidious\r\nbosom of society was not without its charm: Miss Bart had even\r\nbeguiled her leisure with visions of the fair Norma introduced for\r\nthe first time to a family banquet at the Van Osburghs\xe2\x80\x99. But the\r\nthought of being personally connected with the transaction was less\r\nagreeable; and her momentary flashes of amusement were followed by\r\nincreasing periods of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe sense of these doubts was uppermost when, late one afternoon,\r\nshe was surprised by a visit from Lawrence Selden. He found her\r\nalone in the wilderness of pink damask, for in Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s world\r\nthe tea-hour was not dedicated to social rites, and the lady was in\r\nthe hands of her masseuse.\r\n\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s entrance had caused Lily an inward start of embarrassment;\r\nbut his air of constraint had the effect of restoring her\r\nself-possession, and she took at once the tone of surprise and\r\npleasure, wondering frankly that he should have traced her to so\r\nunlikely a place, and asking what had inspired him to make the\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nSelden met this with an unusual seriousness: she had never seen him\r\nso little master of the situation, so plainly at the mercy of any\r\nobstructions she might put in his way. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid; and she could not resist observing in reply that he had kept\r\nhis wishes under remarkable control. She had in truth felt his long\r\nabsence as one of the chief bitternesses of the last months: his\r\ndesertion had wounded sensibilities far below the surface of her\r\npride.\r\n\r\nSelden met the challenge with directness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I have come,\r\nunless I thought I could be of use to you? It is my only excuse for\r\nimagining you could want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis struck her as a clumsy evasion, and the thought gave a flash\r\nof keenness to her answer. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you have come now because you\r\nthink you can be of use to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe hesitated again. \xe2\x80\x9cYes: in the modest capacity of a person to\r\ntalk things over with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a clever man it was certainly a stupid beginning; and the\r\nidea that his awkwardness was due to the fear of her attaching a\r\npersonal significance to his visit, chilled her pleasure in seeing\r\nhim. Even under the most adverse conditions, that pleasure always\r\nmade itself felt: she might hate him, but she had never been able\r\nto wish him out of the room. She was very near hating him now;\r\nyet the sound of his voice, the way the light fell on his thin\r\ndark hair, the way he sat and moved and wore his clothes\xe2\x80\x94she was\r\nconscious that even these trivial things were inwoven with her\r\ndeepest life. In his presence a sudden stillness came upon her, and\r\nthe turmoil of her spirit ceased; but an impulse of resistance to\r\nthis stealing influence now prompted her to say: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very good of\r\nyou to present yourself in that capacity; but what makes you think\r\nI have anything particular to talk about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she kept the even tone of light intercourse, the question\r\nwas framed in a way to remind him that his good offices were\r\nunsought; and for a moment Selden was checked by it. The situation\r\nbetween them was one which could have been cleared up only by a\r\nsudden explosion of feeling; and their whole training and habit\r\nof mind were against the chances of such an explosion. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncalmness seemed rather to harden into resistance, and Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninto a surface of glittering irony, as they faced each other from\r\nthe opposite corners of one of Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s elephantine sofas. The\r\nsofa in question, and the apartment peopled by its monstrous mates,\r\nserved at length to suggest the turn of Selden\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGerty told me that you were acting as Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s secretary; and\r\nI knew she was anxious to hear how you were getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Bart received this explanation without perceptible softening.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t she look me up herself, then?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, as you didn\xe2\x80\x99t send her your address, she was afraid of\r\nbeing importunate.\xe2\x80\x9d Selden continued with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see no such\r\nscruples restrained me; but then I haven\xe2\x80\x99t as much to risk if I\r\nincur your displeasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily answered his smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t incurred it as yet; but I\r\nhave an idea that you are going to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat rests with you, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? You see my initiative doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nbeyond putting myself at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in what capacity? What am I to do with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked in the\r\nsame light tone.\r\n\r\nSelden again glanced about Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room; then he said,\r\nwith a decision which he seemed to have gathered from this final\r\ninspection: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to let me take you away from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily flushed at the suddenness of the attack; then she stiffened\r\nunder it and said coldly: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd may I ask where you mean me to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack to Gerty in the first place, if you will; the essential thing\r\nis that it should be away from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe unusual harshness of his tone might have shown her how much the\r\nwords cost him; but she was in no state to measure his feelings\r\nwhile her own were in a flame of revolt. To neglect her, perhaps\r\neven to avoid her, at a time when she had most need of her friends,\r\nand then suddenly and unwarrantably to break into her life with\r\nthis strange assumption of authority, was to rouse in her every\r\ninstinct of pride and self-defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor taking such an\r\ninterest in my plans; but I am quite contented where I am, and have\r\nno intention of leaving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden had risen, and was standing before her in an attitude of\r\nuncontrollable expectancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat simply means that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nLily rose also, with a quick flash of anger. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have come here\r\nto say disagreeable things about Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only with your relation to Mrs. Hatch that I am concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy relation to Mrs. Hatch is one I have no reason to be ashamed\r\nof. She has helped me to earn a living when my old friends were\r\nquite resigned to seeing me starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Starvation is not the only alternative. You know you can\r\nalways find a home with Gerty till you are independent again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou show such an intimate acquaintance with my affairs that I\r\nsuppose you mean\xe2\x80\x94till my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s legacy is paid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do mean that; Gerty told me of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden acknowledged without\r\nembarrassment. He was too much in earnest now to feel any false\r\nconstraint in speaking his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Gerty does not happen to know,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\r\nowe every penny of that legacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d Selden exclaimed, startled out of his composure by the\r\nabruptness of the statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery penny of it, and more too,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily repeated; \xe2\x80\x9cand you now\r\nperhaps see why I prefer to remain with Mrs. Hatch rather than take\r\nadvantage of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s kindness. I have no money left, except my\r\nsmall income, and I must earn something more to keep myself alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden hesitated a moment; then he rejoined in a quieter tone:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with your income and Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94since you allow me to go so\r\nfar into the details of the situation\xe2\x80\x94you and she could surely\r\ncontrive a life together which would put you beyond the need of\r\nhaving to support yourself. Gerty, I know, is eager to make such an\r\narrangement, and would be quite happy in it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should not,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Bart interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are many reasons\r\nwhy it would be neither kind to Gerty nor wise for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npaused a moment, and as he seemed to await a farther explanation,\r\nadded with a quick lift of her head: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will perhaps excuse me\r\nfrom giving you these reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no claim to know them,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden answered, ignoring her tone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cno claim to offer any comment or suggestion beyond the one I have\r\nalready made. And my right to make that is simply the universal\r\nright of a man to enlighten a woman when he sees her unconsciously\r\nplaced in a false position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat by a false position\r\nyou mean one outside of what we call society; but you must remember\r\nthat I had been excluded from those sacred precincts long before\r\nI met Mrs. Hatch. As far as I can see, there is very little real\r\ndifference in being inside or out, and I remember your once telling\r\nme that it was only those inside who took the difference seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had not been without intention in making this allusion to their\r\nmemorable talk at Bellomont, and she waited with an odd tremor of\r\nthe nerves to see what response it would bring; but the result of\r\nthe experiment was disappointing. Selden did not allow the allusion\r\nto deflect him from his point; he merely said with completer\r\nfulness of emphasis: \xe2\x80\x9cThe question of being inside or out is, as\r\nyou say, a small one, and it happens to have nothing to do with the\r\ncase, except in so far as Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s desire to be inside may put\r\nyou in the position I call false.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of the moderation of his tone, each word he spoke had the\r\neffect of confirming Lily\xe2\x80\x99s resistance. The very apprehensions he\r\naroused hardened her against him: she had been on the alert for the\r\nnote of personal sympathy, for any sign of recovered power over\r\nhim; and his attitude of sober impartiality, the absence of all\r\nresponse to her appeal, turned her hurt pride to blind resentment\r\nof his interference. The conviction that he had been sent by Gerty,\r\nand that, whatever straits he conceived her to be in, he would\r\nnever voluntarily have come to her aid, strengthened her resolve\r\nnot to admit him a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth farther into her confidence.\r\nHowever doubtful she might feel her situation to be, she would\r\nrather persist in darkness than owe her enlightenment to Selden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when he had ceased to speak, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you\r\nimagine me to be situated as you describe; but as you have always\r\ntold me that the sole object of a bringing-up like mine was to\r\nteach a girl to get what she wants, why not assume that that is\r\nprecisely what I am doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe smile with which she summed up her case was like a clear\r\nbarrier raised against farther confidences: its brightness held\r\nhim at such a distance that he had a sense of being almost out of\r\nhearing as he rejoined: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I have ever called you\r\na successful example of that kind of bringing-up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer colour rose a little at the implication, but she steeled\r\nherself with a light laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, wait a little longer\xe2\x80\x94give me a\r\nlittle more time before you decide!\xe2\x80\x9d And as he wavered before her,\r\nstill watching for a break in the impenetrable front she presented:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t give me up; I may still do credit to my training!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\naffirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at those spangles, Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x94every one of \xe2\x80\x99em sewed on\r\ncrooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tall forewoman, a pinched perpendicular figure, dropped the\r\ncondemned structure of wire and net on the table at Lily\xe2\x80\x99s side,\r\nand passed on to the next figure in the line.\r\n\r\nThere were twenty of them in the work-room, their fagged profiles,\r\nunder exaggerated hair, bowed in the harsh north light above\r\nthe utensils of their art; for it was something more than an\r\nindustry, surely, this creation of ever-varied settings for the\r\nface of fortunate womanhood. Their own faces were sallow with the\r\nunwholesomeness of hot air and sedentary toil, rather than with any\r\nactual signs of want: they were employed in a fashionable millinery\r\nestablishment, and were fairly well clothed and well paid; but the\r\nyoungest among them was as dull and colourless as the middle-aged.\r\nIn the whole work-room there was only one skin beneath which the\r\nblood still visibly played; and that now burned with vexation as\r\nMiss Bart, under the lash of the forewoman\xe2\x80\x99s comment, began to\r\nstrip the hat-frame of its over-lapping spangles.\r\n\r\nTo Gerty Farish\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful spirit a solution appeared to have been\r\nreached when she remembered how beautifully Lily could trim hats.\r\nInstances of young lady-milliners establishing themselves under\r\nfashionable patronage, and imparting to their \xe2\x80\x9ccreations\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nindefinable touch which the professional hand can never give, had\r\nflattered Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s visions of the future, and convinced even Lily\r\nthat her separation from Mrs. Norma Hatch need not reduce her to\r\ndependence on her friends.\r\n\r\nThe parting had occurred a few weeks after Selden\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and\r\nwould have taken place sooner had it not been for the resistance\r\nset up in Lily by his ill-starred offer of advice. The sense of\r\nbeing involved in a transaction she would not have cared to examine\r\ntoo closely had soon afterward defined itself in the light of a\r\nhint from Mr. Stancy that, if she \xe2\x80\x9csaw them through,\xe2\x80\x9d she would\r\nhave no reason to be sorry. The implication that such loyalty would\r\nmeet with a direct reward had hastened her flight, and flung her\r\nback, ashamed and penitent, on the broad bosom of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy.\r\nShe did not, however, propose to lie there prone, and Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninspiration about the hats at once revived her hopes of profitable\r\nactivity. Here was, after all, something that her charming listless\r\nhands could really do; she had no doubt of their capacity for\r\nknotting a ribbon or placing a flower to advantage. And of course\r\nonly these finishing touches would be expected of her: subordinate\r\nfingers, blunt, grey, needle-pricked fingers, would prepare the\r\nshapes and stitch the linings, while she presided over the charming\r\nlittle front shop\xe2\x80\x94a shop all white panels, mirrors, and moss-green\r\nhangings\xe2\x80\x94where her finished creations, hats, wreaths, aigrettes\r\nand the rest, perched on their stands like birds just poising for\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nBut at the very outset of Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s campaign this vision of the\r\ngreen-and-white shop had been dispelled. Other young ladies of\r\nfashion had been thus \xe2\x80\x9cset up,\xe2\x80\x9d selling their hats by the mere\r\nattraction of a name and the reputed knack of tying a bow; but\r\nthese privileged beings could command a faith in their powers\r\nmaterially expressed by the readiness to pay their shop-rent and\r\nadvance a handsome sum for current expenses. Where was Lily to\r\nfind such support? And even could it have been found, how were\r\nthe ladies on whose approval she depended to be induced to give\r\nher their patronage? Gerty learned that whatever sympathy her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s case might have excited a few months since had been\r\nimperilled, if not lost, by her association with Mrs. Hatch. Once\r\nagain, Lily had withdrawn from an ambiguous situation in time to\r\nsave her self-respect, but too late for public vindication. Freddy\r\nVan Osburgh was not to marry Mrs. Hatch; he had been rescued at\r\nthe eleventh hour\xe2\x80\x94some said by the efforts of Gus Trenor and\r\nRosedale\xe2\x80\x94and despatched to Europe with old Ned Van Alstyne; but the\r\nrisk he had run would always be ascribed to Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s connivance,\r\nand would somehow serve as a summing-up and corroboration of the\r\nvague general distrust of her. It was a relief to those who had\r\nhung back from her to find themselves thus justified, and they were\r\ninclined to insist a little on her connection with the Hatch case\r\nin order to show that they had been right.\r\n\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s quest, at any rate, brought up against a solid wall of\r\nresistance; and even when Carry Fisher, momentarily penitent\r\nfor her share in the Hatch affair, joined her efforts to Miss\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x99s, they met with no better success. Gerty had tried to veil\r\nher failure in tender ambiguities; but Carry, always the soul of\r\ncandour, put the case squarely to her friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went straight to Judy Trenor; she has fewer prejudices than the\r\nothers, and besides she\xe2\x80\x99s always hated Bertha Dorset. But what HAVE\r\nyou done to her, Lily? At the very first word about giving you a\r\nstart she flamed out about some money you\xe2\x80\x99d got from Gus; I never\r\nknew her so hot before. You know she\xe2\x80\x99ll let him do anything but\r\nspend money on his friends: the only reason she\xe2\x80\x99s decent to me now\r\nis that she knows I\xe2\x80\x99m not hard up.\xe2\x80\x94He speculated for you, you say?\r\nWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the harm? He had no business to lose. He DIDN\xe2\x80\x99T lose?\r\nThen what on earth\xe2\x80\x94but I never COULD understand you, Lily!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that, after anxious enquiry and much\r\ndeliberation, Mrs. Fisher and Gerty, for once oddly united in\r\ntheir effort to help their friend, decided on placing her in the\r\nwork-room of Mme. Regina\xe2\x80\x99s renowned millinery establishment. Even\r\nthis arrangement was not effected without considerable negotiation,\r\nfor Mme. Regina had a strong prejudice against untrained\r\nassistance, and was induced to yield only by the fact that she\r\nowed the patronage of Mrs. Bry and Mrs. Gormer to Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence. She had been willing from the first to employ Lily in\r\nthe show-room: as a displayer of hats, a fashionable beauty might\r\nbe a valuable asset. But to this suggestion Miss Bart opposed a\r\nnegative which Gerty emphatically supported, while Mrs. Fisher,\r\ninwardly unconvinced, but resigned to this latest proof of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunreason, agreed that perhaps in the end it would be more useful\r\nthat she should learn the trade. To Regina\xe2\x80\x99s work-room Lily was\r\ntherefore committed by her friends, and there Mrs. Fisher left her\r\nwith a sigh of relief, while Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s watchfulness continued to\r\nhover over her at a distance.\r\n\r\nLily had taken up her work early in January: it was now two months\r\nlater, and she was still being rebuked for her inability to sew\r\nspangles on a hat-frame. As she returned to her work she heard\r\na titter pass down the tables. She knew she was an object of\r\ncriticism and amusement to the other work-women. They were, of\r\ncourse, aware of her history\xe2\x80\x94the exact situation of every girl\r\nin the room was known and freely discussed by all the others\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthe knowledge did not produce in them any awkward sense of class\r\ndistinction: it merely explained why her untutored fingers were\r\nstill blundering over the rudiments of the trade. Lily had no\r\ndesire that they should recognize any social difference in her; but\r\nshe had hoped to be received as their equal, and perhaps before\r\nlong to show herself their superior by a special deftness of touch,\r\nand it was humiliating to find that, after two months of drudgery,\r\nshe still betrayed her lack of early training. Remote was the day\r\nwhen she might aspire to exercise the talents she felt confident\r\nof possessing; only experienced workers were entrusted with the\r\ndelicate art of shaping and trimming the hat, and the forewoman\r\nstill held her inexorably to the routine of preparatory work.\r\n\r\nShe began to rip the spangles from the frame, listening absently to\r\nthe buzz of talk which rose and fell with the coming and going of\r\nMiss Haines\xe2\x80\x99s active figure. The air was closer than usual, because\r\nMiss Haines, who had a cold, had not allowed a window to be opened\r\neven during the noon recess; and Lily\xe2\x80\x99s head was so heavy with the\r\nweight of a sleepless night that the chatter of her companions had\r\nthe incoherence of a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI TOLD her he\xe2\x80\x99d never look at her again; and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave, either\xe2\x80\x94I think she acted real mean to him. He took her to\r\nthe Arion Ball, and had a hack for her both ways.... She\xe2\x80\x99s taken\r\nten bottles, and her headaches don\xe2\x80\x99t seem no better\xe2\x80\x94but she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwritten a testimonial to say the first bottle cured her, and she\r\ngot five dollars and her picture in the paper.... Mrs. Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhat? The one with the green Paradise? Here, Miss Haines\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nready right off.... That was one of the Trenor girls here yesterday\r\nwith Mrs. George Dorset. How\xe2\x80\x99d I know? Why, Madam sent for me to\r\nalter the flower in that Virot hat\xe2\x80\x94the blue tulle: she\xe2\x80\x99s tall and\r\nslight, with her hair fuzzed out\xe2\x80\x94a good deal like Mamie Leach, on\xe2\x80\x99y\r\nthinner....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn and on it flowed, a current of meaningless sound, on which,\r\nstartlingly enough, a familiar name now and then floated to the\r\nsurface. It was the strangest part of Lily\xe2\x80\x99s strange experience,\r\nthe hearing of these names, the seeing the fragmentary and\r\ndistorted image of the world she had lived in reflected in the\r\nmirror of the working-girls\xe2\x80\x99 minds. She had never before suspected\r\nthe mixture of insatiable curiosity and contemptuous freedom with\r\nwhich she and her kind were discussed in this underworld of toilers\r\nwho lived on their vanity and self-indulgence. Every girl in Mme.\r\nRegina\xe2\x80\x99s work-room knew to whom the headgear in her hands was\r\ndestined, and had her opinion of its future wearer, and a definite\r\nknowledge of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s place in the social system. That Lily\r\nwas a star fallen from that sky did not, after the first stir of\r\ncuriosity had subsided, materially add to their interest in her.\r\nShe had fallen, she had \xe2\x80\x9cgone under,\xe2\x80\x9d and true to the ideal of\r\ntheir race, they were awed only by success\xe2\x80\x94by the gross tangible\r\nimage of material achievement. The consciousness of her different\r\npoint of view merely kept them at a little distance from her, as\r\nthough she were a foreigner with whom it was an effort to talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t sew those spangles on more regular I guess\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d better give the hat to Miss Kilroy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily looked down ruefully at her handiwork. The forewoman was\r\nright: the sewing on of the spangles was inexcusably bad. What\r\nmade her so much more clumsy than usual? Was it a growing distaste\r\nfor her task, or actual physical disability? She felt tired and\r\nconfused: it was an effort to put her thoughts together. She rose\r\nand handed the hat to Miss Kilroy, who took it with a suppressed\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry; I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I am not well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the forewoman.\r\n\r\nMiss Haines offered no comment. From the first she had augured ill\r\nof Mme. Regina\xe2\x80\x99s consenting to include a fashionable apprentice\r\namong her workers. In that temple of art no raw beginners were\r\nwanted, and Miss Haines would have been more than human had she not\r\ntaken a certain pleasure in seeing her forebodings confirmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better go back to binding edges,\xe2\x80\x9d she said drily. Lily\r\nslipped out last among the band of liberated work-women. She\r\ndid not care to be mingled in their noisy dispersal: once in\r\nthe street, she always felt an irresistible return to her old\r\nstandpoint, an instinctive shrinking from all that was unpolished\r\nand promiscuous. In the days\xe2\x80\x94how distant they now seemed!\xe2\x80\x94when she\r\nhad visited the Girls\xe2\x80\x99 Club with Gerty Farish, she had felt an\r\nenlightened interest in the working-classes; but that was because\r\nshe looked down on them from above, from the happy altitude of her\r\ngrace and her beneficence. Now that she was on a level with them,\r\nthe point of view was less interesting.\r\n\r\nShe felt a touch on her arm, and met the penitent eye of Miss\r\nKilroy. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Bart, I guess you can sew those spangles on as well\r\nas I can when you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling right. Miss Haines didn\xe2\x80\x99t act fair to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s colour rose at the unexpected advance: it was a long time\r\nsince real kindness had looked at her from any eyes but Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank you: I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly well, but Miss Haines was\r\nright. I AM clumsy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s mean work for anybody with a headache.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Kilroy\r\npaused irresolutely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to go right home and lay down. Ever\r\ntry orangeine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d Lily held out her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very kind of you\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\nto go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked gratefully at Miss Kilroy, but neither knew what more\r\nto say. Lily was aware that the other was on the point of offering\r\nto go home with her, but she wanted to be alone and silent\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nkindness, the sort of kindness that Miss Kilroy could give, would\r\nhave jarred on her just then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated as she turned away.\r\n\r\nShe struck westward through the dreary March twilight, toward\r\nthe street where her boarding-house stood. She had resolutely\r\nrefused Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s offer of hospitality. Something of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfierce shrinking from observation and sympathy was beginning to\r\ndevelop in her, and the promiscuity of small quarters and close\r\nintimacy seemed, on the whole, less endurable than the solitude of\r\na hall bedroom in a house where she could come and go unremarked\r\namong other workers. For a while she had been sustained by this\r\ndesire for privacy and independence; but now, perhaps from\r\nincreasing physical weariness, the lassitude brought about by\r\nhours of unwonted confinement, she was beginning to feel acutely\r\nthe ugliness and discomfort of her surroundings. The day\xe2\x80\x99s task\r\ndone, she dreaded to return to her narrow room, with its blotched\r\nwall-paper and shabby paint; and she hated every step of the walk\r\nthither, through the degradation of a New York street in the last\r\nstages of decline from fashion to commerce.\r\n\r\nBut what she dreaded most of all was having to pass the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat the corner of Sixth Avenue. She had meant to take another\r\nstreet: she had usually done so of late. But today her steps were\r\nirresistibly drawn toward the flaring plate-glass corner; she tried\r\nto take the lower crossing, but a laden dray crowded her back, and\r\nshe struck across the street obliquely, reaching the sidewalk just\r\nopposite the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\nOver the counter she caught the eye of the clerk who had waited\r\non her before, and slipped the prescription into his hand. There\r\ncould be no question about the prescription: it was a copy of one\r\nof Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s, obligingly furnished by that lady\xe2\x80\x99s chemist. Lily\r\nwas confident that the clerk would fill it without hesitation;\r\nyet the nervous dread of a refusal, or even of an expression of\r\ndoubt, communicated itself to her restless hands as she affected to\r\nexamine the bottles of perfume stacked on the glass case before her.\r\n\r\nThe clerk had read the prescription without comment; but in the act\r\nof handing out the bottle he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want to increase the dose, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s heart contracted.\r\n\r\nWhat did he mean by looking at her in that way?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right: it\xe2\x80\x99s a queer-acting drug. A drop or two more,\r\nand off you go\xe2\x80\x94the doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dread lest he should question her, or keep the bottle back,\r\nchoked the murmur of acquiescence in her throat; and when at length\r\nshe emerged safely from the shop she was almost dizzy with the\r\nintensity of her relief. The mere touch of the packet thrilled her\r\ntired nerves with the delicious promise of a night of sleep, and in\r\nthe reaction from her momentary fear she felt as if the first fumes\r\nof drowsiness were already stealing over her.\r\n\r\nIn her confusion she stumbled against a man who was hurrying down\r\nthe last steps of the elevated station. He drew back, and she heard\r\nher name uttered with surprise. It was Rosedale, fur-coated, glossy\r\nand prosperous\xe2\x80\x94but why did she seem to see him so far off, and as\r\nif through a mist of splintered crystals? Before she could account\r\nfor the phenomenon she found herself shaking hands with him. They\r\nhad parted with scorn on her side and anger upon his; but all trace\r\nof these emotions seemed to vanish as their hands met, and she was\r\nonly aware of a confused wish that she might continue to hold fast\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Miss Lily? You\xe2\x80\x99re not well!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed;\r\nand she forced her lips into a pallid smile of reassurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a little tired\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. Stay with me a moment, please,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe faltered. That she should be asking this service of Rosedale!\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the dirty and unpropitious corner on which they\r\nstood, with the shriek of the \xe2\x80\x9celevated\xe2\x80\x9d and the tumult of trams\r\nand waggons contending hideously in their ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here; but let me take you somewhere for a cup of\r\ntea. The LONGWORTH is only a few yards off, and there\xe2\x80\x99ll be no one\r\nthere at this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cup of tea in quiet, somewhere out of the noise and ugliness,\r\nseemed for the moment the one solace she could bear. A few steps\r\nbrought them to the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 door of the hotel he had named, and\r\na moment later he was seated opposite to her, and the waiter had\r\nplaced the tea-tray between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a drop of brandy or whiskey first? You look regularly done up,\r\nMiss Lily. Well, take your tea strong, then; and, waiter, get a\r\ncushion for the lady\xe2\x80\x99s back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily smiled faintly at the injunction to take her tea strong.\r\nIt was the temptation she was always struggling to resist. Her\r\ncraving for the keen stimulant was forever conflicting with that\r\nother craving for sleep\xe2\x80\x94the midnight craving which only the little\r\nphial in her hand could still. But today, at any rate, the tea\r\ncould hardly be too strong: she counted on it to pour warmth and\r\nresolution into her empty veins.\r\n\r\nAs she leaned back before him, her lids drooping in utter\r\nlassitude, though the first warm draught already tinged her face\r\nwith returning life, Rosedale was seized afresh by the poignant\r\nsurprise of her beauty. The dark pencilling of fatigue under her\r\neyes, the morbid blue-veined pallor of the temples, brought out the\r\nbrightness of her hair and lips, as though all her ebbing vitality\r\nwere centred there. Against the dull chocolate-coloured background\r\nof the restaurant, the purity of her head stood out as it had\r\nnever done in the most brightly lit ball-room. He looked at her\r\nwith a startled uncomfortable feeling, as though her beauty were a\r\nforgotten enemy that had lain in ambush and now sprang out on him\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nTo clear the air he tried to take an easy tone with her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Miss\r\nLily, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you for an age. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what had become\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he was checked by an embarrassing sense of the\r\ncomplications to which this might lead. Though he had not seen her\r\nhe had heard of her; he knew of her connection with Mrs. Hatch, and\r\nof the talk resulting from it. Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s MILIEU was one which he\r\nhad once assiduously frequented, and now as devoutly shunned.\r\n\r\nLily, to whom the tea had restored her usual clearness of mind, saw\r\nwhat was in his thoughts and said with a slight smile: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would\r\nnot be likely to know about me. I have joined the working-classes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stared in genuine wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\xe2\x80\x94? Why, what on earth\r\nare you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLearning to be a milliner\xe2\x80\x94at least TRYING to learn,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastily\r\nqualified the statement.\r\n\r\nRosedale suppressed a low whistle of surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cCome off\xe2\x80\x94you ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nserious, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly serious. I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to work for my living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I understood\xe2\x80\x94I thought you were with Norma Hatch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard I had gone to her as her secretary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething of the kind, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d He leaned forward to refill her\r\ncup.\r\n\r\nLily guessed the possibilities of embarrassment which the topic\r\nheld for him, and raising her eyes to his, she said suddenly: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nleft her two months ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosedale continued to fumble awkwardly with the tea-pot, and she\r\nfelt sure that he had heard what had been said of her. But what was\r\nthere that Rosedale did not hear?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a soft berth?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired, with an attempt at lightness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo soft\xe2\x80\x94one might have sunk in too deep.\xe2\x80\x9d Lily rested one arm on\r\nthe edge of the table, and sat looking at him more intently than\r\nshe had ever looked before. An uncontrollable impulse was urging\r\nher to put her case to this man, from whose curiosity she had\r\nalways so fiercely defended herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Mrs. Hatch, I think? Well, perhaps you can understand\r\nthat she might make things too easy for one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosedale looked faintly puzzled, and she remembered that\r\nallusiveness was lost on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was no place for you, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed, so suffused and\r\nimmersed in the light of her full gaze that he found himself being\r\ndrawn into strange depths of intimacy. He who had had to subsist\r\non mere fugitive glances, looks winged in flight and swiftly lost\r\nunder covert, now found her eyes settling on him with a brooding\r\nintensity that fairly dazzled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily continued, \xe2\x80\x9clest people should say I was helping\r\nMrs. Hatch to marry Freddy Van Osburgh\xe2\x80\x94who is not in the least too\r\ngood for her\xe2\x80\x94and as they still continue to say it, I see that I\r\nmight as well have stayed where I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Freddy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Rosedale brushed aside the topic with an air of its\r\nunimportance which gave a sense of the immense perspective he had\r\nacquired. \xe2\x80\x9cFreddy don\xe2\x80\x99t count\xe2\x80\x94but I knew YOU weren\xe2\x80\x99t mixed up in\r\nthat. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t your style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily coloured slightly: she could not conceal from herself that\r\nthe words gave her pleasure. She would have liked to sit there,\r\ndrinking more tea, and continuing to talk of herself to Rosedale.\r\nBut the old habit of observing the conventions reminded her that it\r\nwas time to bring their colloquy to an end, and she made a faint\r\nmotion to push back her chair.\r\n\r\nRosedale stopped her with a protesting gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t go yet; sit quiet and rest a little longer. You look\r\nthoroughly played out. And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He broke off,\r\nconscious of going farther than he had meant. She saw the struggle\r\nand understood it; understood also the nature of the spell to which\r\nhe yielded as, with his eyes on her face, he began again abruptly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth did you mean by saying just now that you were\r\nlearning to be a milliner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I said. I am an apprentice at Regina\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Lord\xe2\x80\x94YOU? But what for? I knew your aunt had turned you down:\r\nMrs. Fisher told me about it. But I understood you got a legacy\r\nfrom her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got ten thousand dollars; but the legacy is not to be paid till\r\nnext summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but\xe2\x80\x94look here: you could BORROW on it any time you wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; for I owe it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwe it? The whole ten thousand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery penny.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and then continued abruptly, with her\r\neyes on his face: \xe2\x80\x9cI think Gus Trenor spoke to you once about\r\nhaving made some money for me in stocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited, and Rosedale, congested with embarrassment, muttered\r\nthat he remembered something of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made about nine thousand dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily pursued, in the same\r\ntone of eager communicativeness. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the time, I understood that\r\nhe was speculating with my own money: it was incredibly stupid of\r\nme, but I knew nothing of business. Afterward I found out that he\r\nhad NOT used my money\xe2\x80\x94that what he said he had made for me he had\r\nreally given me. It was meant in kindness, of course; but it was\r\nnot the sort of obligation one could remain under. Unfortunately\r\nI had spent the money before I discovered my mistake; and so my\r\nlegacy will have to go to pay it back. That is the reason why I am\r\ntrying to learn a trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made the statement clearly, deliberately, with pauses between\r\nthe sentences, so that each should have time to sink deeply into\r\nher hearer\xe2\x80\x99s mind. She had a passionate desire that some one\r\nshould know the truth about this transaction, and also that the\r\nrumour of her intention to repay the money should reach Judy\r\nTrenor\xe2\x80\x99s ears. And it had suddenly occurred to her that Rosedale,\r\nwho had surprised Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, was the fitting person to\r\nreceive and transmit her version of the facts. She had even felt\r\na momentary exhilaration at the thought of thus relieving herself\r\nof her detested secret; but the sensation gradually faded in the\r\ntelling, and as she ended her pallor was suffused with a deep blush\r\nof misery.\r\n\r\nRosedale continued to stare at her in wonder; but the wonder took\r\nthe turn she had least expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut see here\xe2\x80\x94if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, it cleans you out altogether?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put it to her as if she had not grasped the consequences of her\r\nact; as if her incorrigible ignorance of business were about to\r\nprecipitate her into a fresh act of folly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAltogether\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she calmly agreed.\r\n\r\nHe sat silent, his thick hands clasped on the table, his little\r\npuzzled eyes exploring the recesses of the deserted restaurant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s fine,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed abruptly.\r\n\r\nLily rose from her seat with a deprecating laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmerely a bore,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted, gathering together the ends of her\r\nfeather scarf.\r\n\r\nRosedale remained seated, too intent on his thoughts to notice her\r\nmovement. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lily, if you want any backing\xe2\x80\x94I like pluck\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d broke\r\nfrom him disconnectedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d She held out her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYour tea has given me a\r\ntremendous backing. I feel equal to anything now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer gesture seemed to show a definite intention of dismissal, but\r\nher companion had tossed a bill to the waiter, and was slipping his\r\nshort arms into his expensive overcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to let me walk home with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nLily uttered no protest, and when he had paused to make sure of\r\nhis change they emerged from the hotel and crossed Sixth Avenue\r\nagain. As she led the way westward past a long line of areas which,\r\nthrough the distortion of their paintless rails, revealed with\r\nincreasing candour the DISJECTA MEMBRA of bygone dinners, Lily felt\r\nthat Rosedale was taking contemptuous note of the neighbourhood;\r\nand before the doorstep at which she finally paused he looked up\r\nwith an air of incredulous disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the place? Some one told me you were living with Miss\r\nFarish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: I am boarding here. I have lived too long on my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe continued to scan the blistered brown stone front, the windows\r\ndraped with discoloured lace, and the Pompeian decoration of the\r\nmuddy vestibule; then he looked back at her face and said with a\r\nvisible effort: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll let me come and see you some day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, recognizing the heroism of the offer to the point of\r\nbeing frankly touched by it. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you\xe2\x80\x94I shall be very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmade answer, in the first sincere words she had ever spoken to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat evening in her own room Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x94who had fled early from\r\nthe heavy fumes of the basement dinner-table\xe2\x80\x94sat musing upon the\r\nimpulse which had led her to unbosom herself to Rosedale. Beneath\r\nit she discovered an increasing sense of loneliness\xe2\x80\x94a dread of\r\nreturning to the solitude of her room, while she could be anywhere\r\nelse, or in any company but her own. Circumstances, of late, had\r\ncombined to cut her off more and more from her few remaining\r\nfriends. On Carry Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s part the withdrawal was perhaps not\r\nquite involuntary. Having made her final effort on Lily\xe2\x80\x99s behalf,\r\nand landed her safely in Mme. Regina\xe2\x80\x99s work-room, Mrs. Fisher\r\nseemed disposed to rest from her labours; and Lily, understanding\r\nthe reason, could not condemn her. Carry had in fact come\r\ndangerously near to being involved in the episode of Mrs. Norma\r\nHatch, and it had taken some verbal ingenuity to extricate herself.\r\nShe frankly owned to having brought Lily and Mrs. Hatch together,\r\nbut then she did not know Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x94she had expressly warned Lily\r\nthat she did not know Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x94and besides, she was not Lily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkeeper, and really the girl was old enough to take care of herself.\r\nCarry did not put her own case so brutally, but she allowed it to\r\nbe thus put for her by her latest bosom friend, Mrs. Jack Stepney:\r\nMrs. Stepney, trembling over the narrowness of her only brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nescape, but eager to vindicate Mrs. Fisher, at whose house she\r\ncould count on the \xe2\x80\x9cjolly parties\xe2\x80\x9d which had become a necessity to\r\nher since marriage had emancipated her from the Van Osburgh point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nLily understood the situation and could make allowances for it.\r\nCarry had been a good friend to her in difficult days, and perhaps\r\nonly a friendship like Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s could be proof against such an\r\nincreasing strain. Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s friendship did indeed hold fast; yet\r\nLily was beginning to avoid her also. For she could not go to\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s without risk of meeting Selden; and to meet him now would\r\nbe pure pain. It was pain enough even to think of him, whether she\r\nconsidered him in the distinctness of her waking thoughts, or felt\r\nthe obsession of his presence through the blur of her tormented\r\nnights. That was one of the reasons why she had turned again to\r\nMrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s prescription. In the uneasy snatches of her natural\r\ndreams he came to her sometimes in the old guise of fellowship and\r\ntenderness; and she would rise from the sweet delusion mocked and\r\nemptied of her courage. But in the sleep which the phial procured\r\nshe sank far below such half-waking visitations, sank into depths\r\nof dreamless annihilation from which she woke each morning with an\r\nobliterated past.\r\n\r\nGradually, to be sure, the stress of the old thoughts would return;\r\nbut at least they did not importune her waking hour. The drug\r\ngave her a momentary illusion of complete renewal, from which she\r\ndrew strength to take up her daily work. The strength was more\r\nand more needed as the perplexities of her future increased. She\r\nknew that to Gerty and Mrs. Fisher she was only passing through\r\na temporary period of probation, since they believed that the\r\napprenticeship she was serving at Mme. Regina\xe2\x80\x99s would enable her,\r\nwhen Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s legacy was paid, to realize the vision of the\r\ngreen-and-white shop with the fuller competence acquired by her\r\npreliminary training. But to Lily herself, aware that the legacy\r\ncould not be put to such a use, the preliminary training seemed\r\na wasted effort. She understood clearly enough that, even if she\r\ncould ever learn to compete with hands formed from childhood\r\nfor their special work, the small pay she received would not be\r\na sufficient addition to her income to compensate her for such\r\ndrudgery. And the realization of this fact brought her recurringly\r\nface to face with the temptation to use the legacy in establishing\r\nher business. Once installed, and in command of her own work-women,\r\nshe believed she had sufficient tact and ability to attract a\r\nfashionable CLIENTELE; and if the business succeeded she could\r\ngradually lay aside money enough to discharge her debt to Trenor.\r\nBut the task might take years to accomplish, even if she continued\r\nto stint herself to the utmost; and meanwhile her pride would be\r\ncrushed under the weight of an intolerable obligation.\r\n\r\nThese were her superficial considerations; but under them lurked\r\nthe secret dread that the obligation might not always remain\r\nintolerable. She knew she could not count on her continuity of\r\npurpose, and what really frightened her was the thought that she\r\nmight gradually accommodate herself to remaining indefinitely\r\nin Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s debt, as she had accommodated herself to the part\r\nallotted her on the Sabrina, and as she had so nearly drifted\r\ninto acquiescing with Stancy\xe2\x80\x99s scheme for the advancement of Mrs.\r\nHatch. Her danger lay, as she knew, in her old incurable dread\r\nof discomfort and poverty; in the fear of that mounting tide of\r\ndinginess against which her mother had so passionately warned her.\r\nAnd now a new vista of peril opened before her. She understood\r\nthat Rosedale was ready to lend her money; and the longing to take\r\nadvantage of his offer began to haunt her insidiously. It was of\r\ncourse impossible to accept a loan from Rosedale; but proximate\r\npossibilities hovered temptingly before her. She was quite sure\r\nthat he would come and see her again, and almost sure that, if he\r\ndid, she could bring him to the point of offering to marry her on\r\nthe terms she had previously rejected. Would she still reject them\r\nif they were offered? More and more, with every fresh mischance\r\nbefalling her, did the pursuing furies seem to take the shape of\r\nBertha Dorset; and close at hand, safely locked among her papers,\r\nlay the means of ending their pursuit. The temptation, which her\r\nscorn of Rosedale had once enabled her to reject, now insistently\r\nreturned upon her; and how much strength was left her to oppose it?\r\n\r\nWhat little there was must at any rate be husbanded to the utmost;\r\nshe could not trust herself again to the perils of a sleepless\r\nnight. Through the long hours of silence the dark spirit of fatigue\r\nand loneliness crouched upon her breast, leaving her so drained\r\nof bodily strength that her morning thoughts swam in a haze of\r\nweakness. The only hope of renewal lay in the little bottle at her\r\nbed-side; and how much longer that hope would last she dared not\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\n\r\nLily, lingering for a moment on the corner, looked out on the\r\nafternoon spectacle of Fifth Avenue. It was a day in late April,\r\nand the sweetness of spring was in the air. It mitigated the\r\nugliness of the long crowded thoroughfare, blurred the gaunt\r\nroof-lines, threw a mauve veil over the discouraging perspective of\r\nthe side streets, and gave a touch of poetry to the delicate haze\r\nof green that marked the entrance to the Park.\r\n\r\nAs Lily stood there, she recognized several familiar faces in the\r\npassing carriages. The season was over, and its ruling forces had\r\ndisbanded; but a few still lingered, delaying their departure for\r\nEurope, or passing through town on their return from the South.\r\nAmong them was Mrs. Van Osburgh, swaying majestically in her\r\nC-spring barouche, with Mrs. Percy Gryce at her side, and the new\r\nheir to the Gryce millions enthroned before them on his nurse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknees. They were succeeded by Mrs. Hatch\xe2\x80\x99s electric victoria, in\r\nwhich that lady reclined in the lonely splendour of a spring toilet\r\nobviously designed for company; and a moment or two later came Judy\r\nTrenor, accompanied by Lady Skiddaw, who had come over for her\r\nannual tarpon fishing and a dip into \xe2\x80\x9cthe street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis fleeting glimpse of her past served to emphasize the sense\r\nof aimlessness with which Lily at length turned toward home. She\r\nhad nothing to do for the rest of the day, nor for the days to\r\ncome; for the season was over in millinery as well as in society,\r\nand a week earlier Mme. Regina had notified her that her services\r\nwere no longer required. Mme. Regina always reduced her staff on\r\nthe first of May, and Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s attendance had of late been so\r\nirregular\xe2\x80\x94she had so often been unwell, and had done so little work\r\nwhen she came\xe2\x80\x94that it was only as a favour that her dismissal had\r\nhitherto been deferred.\r\n\r\nLily did not question the justice of the decision. She was\r\nconscious of having been forgetful, awkward and slow to learn. It\r\nwas bitter to acknowledge her inferiority even to herself, but the\r\nfact had been brought home to her that as a bread-winner she could\r\nnever compete with professional ability. Since she had been brought\r\nup to be ornamental, she could hardly blame herself for failing to\r\nserve any practical purpose; but the discovery put an end to her\r\nconsoling sense of universal efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs she turned homeward her thoughts shrank in anticipation from the\r\nfact that there would be nothing to get up for the next morning.\r\nThe luxury of lying late in bed was a pleasure belonging to the\r\nlife of ease; it had no part in the utilitarian existence of the\r\nboarding-house. She liked to leave her room early, and to return to\r\nit as late as possible; and she was walking slowly now in order to\r\npostpone the detested approach to her doorstep.\r\n\r\nBut the doorstep, as she drew near it, acquired a sudden interest\r\nfrom the fact that it was occupied\xe2\x80\x94and indeed filled\xe2\x80\x94by the\r\nconspicuous figure of Mr. Rosedale, whose presence seemed to take\r\non an added amplitude from the meanness of his surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe sight stirred Lily with an irresistible sense of triumph.\r\nRosedale, a day or two after their chance meeting, had called to\r\nenquire if she had recovered from her indisposition; but since\r\nthen she had not seen or heard from him, and his absence seemed\r\nto betoken a struggle to keep away, to let her pass once more out\r\nof his life. If this were the case, his return showed that the\r\nstruggle had been unsuccessful, for Lily knew he was not the man to\r\nwaste his time in an ineffectual sentimental dalliance. He was too\r\nbusy, too practical, and above all too much preoccupied with his\r\nown advancement, to indulge in such unprofitable asides.\r\n\r\nIn the peacock-blue parlour, with its bunches of dried pampas\r\ngrass, and discoloured steel engravings of sentimental episodes,\r\nhe looked about him with unconcealed disgust, laying his hat\r\ndistrustfully on the dusty console adorned with a Rogers statuette.\r\n\r\nLily sat down on one of the plush and rosewood sofas, and he\r\ndeposited himself in a rocking-chair draped with a starched\r\nantimacassar which scraped unpleasantly against the pink fold of\r\nskin above his collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t go on living here!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nLily smiled at his tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I can; but I have gone\r\nover my expenses very carefully, and I rather think I shall be able\r\nto manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe able to manage it? That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I mean\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s no place for\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean; for I have been out of work for the last week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of work\xe2\x80\x94out of work! What a way for you to talk! The idea\r\nof your having to work\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous.\xe2\x80\x9d He brought out his\r\nsentences in short violent jerks, as though they were forced up\r\nfrom a deep inner crater of indignation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a farce\xe2\x80\x94a crazy\r\nfarce,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, his eyes fixed on the long vista of the room\r\nreflected in the blotched glass between the windows.\r\n\r\nLily continued to meet his expostulations with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow why I should regard myself as an exception\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you ARE; that\xe2\x80\x99s why; and your being in a place like this\r\nis a damnable outrage. I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it calmly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had in truth never seen him so shaken out of his usual\r\nglibness; and there was something almost moving to her in his\r\ninarticulate struggle with his emotions.\r\n\r\nHe rose with a start which left the rocking-chair quivering on its\r\nbeam ends, and placed himself squarely before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Miss Lily, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Europe next week: going over\r\nto Paris and London for a couple of months\xe2\x80\x94and I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave you\r\nlike this. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s none of my business\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nlet me understand that often enough; but things are worse with you\r\nnow than they have been before, and you must see that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\naccept help from somebody. You spoke to me the other day about some\r\ndebt to Trenor. I know what you mean\xe2\x80\x94and I respect you for feeling\r\nas you do about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA blush of surprise rose to Lily\xe2\x80\x99s pale face, but before she could\r\ninterrupt him he had continued eagerly: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend you the\r\nmoney to pay Trenor; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94see here, don\xe2\x80\x99t take me up\r\ntill I\xe2\x80\x99ve finished. What I mean is, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a plain business\r\narrangement, such as one man would make with another. Now, what\r\nhave you got to say against that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s blush deepened to a glow in which humiliation and gratitude\r\nwere mingled; and both sentiments revealed themselves in the\r\nunexpected gentleness of her reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this: that it is exactly what Gus Trenor proposed; and that\r\nI can never again be sure of understanding the plainest business\r\narrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, realizing that this answer contained a germ\r\nof injustice, she added, even more kindly: \xe2\x80\x9cNot that I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nappreciate your kindness\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99m not grateful for it. But a\r\nbusiness arrangement between us would in any case be impossible,\r\nbecause I shall have no security to give when my debt to Gus Trenor\r\nhas been paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosedale received this statement in silence: he seemed to feel the\r\nnote of finality in her voice, yet to be unable to accept it as\r\nclosing the question between them.\r\n\r\nIn the silence Lily had a clear perception of what was passing\r\nthrough his mind. Whatever perplexity he felt as to the\r\ninexorableness of her course\xe2\x80\x94however little he penetrated its\r\nmotive\xe2\x80\x94she saw that it unmistakably tended to strengthen her hold\r\nover him. It was as though the sense in her of unexplained scruples\r\nand resistances had the same attraction as the delicacy of feature,\r\nthe fastidiousness of manner, which gave her an external rarity,\r\nan air of being impossible to match. As he advanced in social\r\nexperience this uniqueness had acquired a greater value for him,\r\nas though he were a collector who had learned to distinguish minor\r\ndifferences of design and quality in some long-coveted object.\r\n\r\nLily, perceiving all this, understood that he would marry her\r\nat once, on the sole condition of a reconciliation with Mrs.\r\nDorset; and the temptation was the less easy to put aside because,\r\nlittle by little, circumstances were breaking down her dislike\r\nfor Rosedale. The dislike, indeed, still subsisted; but it was\r\npenetrated here and there by the perception of mitigating qualities\r\nin him: of a certain gross kindliness, a rather helpless fidelity\r\nof sentiment, which seemed to be struggling through the hard\r\nsurface of his material ambitions.\r\n\r\nReading his dismissal in her eyes, he held out his hand with a\r\ngesture which conveyed something of this inarticulate conflict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99d only let me, I\xe2\x80\x99d set you up over them all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d put you\r\nwhere you could wipe your feet on \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared; and it touched\r\nher oddly to see that his new passion had not altered his old\r\nstandard of values.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLily took no sleeping-drops that night. She lay awake viewing her\r\nsituation in the crude light which Rosedale\xe2\x80\x99s visit had shed on\r\nit. In fending off the offer he was so plainly ready to renew, had\r\nshe not sacrificed to one of those abstract notions of honour that\r\nmight be called the conventionalities of the moral life? What debt\r\ndid she owe to a social order which had condemned and banished her\r\nwithout trial? She had never been heard in her own defence; she was\r\ninnocent of the charge on which she had been found guilty; and the\r\nirregularity of her conviction might seem to justify the use of\r\nmethods as irregular in recovering her lost rights. Bertha Dorset,\r\nto save herself, had not scrupled to ruin her by an open falsehood;\r\nwhy should she hesitate to make private use of the facts that\r\nchance had put in her way? After all, half the opprobrium of such\r\nan act lies in the name attached to it. Call it blackmail and it\r\nbecomes unthinkable; but explain that it injures no one, and that\r\nthe rights regained by it were unjustly forfeited, and he must be a\r\nformalist indeed who can find no plea in its defence.\r\n\r\nThe arguments pleading for it with Lily were the old unanswerable\r\nones of the personal situation: the sense of injury, the sense\r\nof failure, the passionate craving for a fair chance against the\r\nselfish despotism of society. She had learned by experience that\r\nshe had neither the aptitude nor the moral constancy to remake her\r\nlife on new lines; to become a worker among workers, and let the\r\nworld of luxury and pleasure sweep by her unregarded. She could not\r\nhold herself much to blame for this ineffectiveness, and she was\r\nperhaps less to blame than she believed. Inherited tendencies had\r\ncombined with early training to make her the highly specialized\r\nproduct she was: an organism as helpless out of its narrow range as\r\nthe sea-anemone torn from the rock. She had been fashioned to adorn\r\nand delight; to what other end does nature round the rose-leaf and\r\npaint the humming-bird\xe2\x80\x99s breast? And was it her fault that the\r\npurely decorative mission is less easily and harmoniously fulfilled\r\namong social beings than in the world of nature? That it is apt\r\nto be hampered by material necessities or complicated by moral\r\nscruples?\r\n\r\nThese last were the two antagonistic forces which fought out their\r\nbattle in her breast during the long watches of the night; and\r\nwhen she rose the next morning she hardly knew where the victory\r\nlay. She was exhausted by the reaction of a night without sleep,\r\ncoming after many nights of rest artificially obtained; and in the\r\ndistorting light of fatigue the future stretched out before her\r\ngrey, interminable and desolate.\r\n\r\nShe lay late in bed, refusing the coffee and fried eggs which the\r\nfriendly Irish servant thrust through her door, and hating the\r\nintimate domestic noises of the house and the cries and rumblings\r\nof the street. Her week of idleness had brought home to her with\r\nexaggerated force these small aggravations of the boarding-house\r\nworld, and she yearned for that other luxurious world, whose\r\nmachinery is so carefully concealed that one scene flows into\r\nanother without perceptible agency.\r\n\r\nAt length she rose and dressed. Since she had left Mme. Regina\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshe had spent her days in the streets, partly to escape from the\r\nuncongenial promiscuities of the boarding-house, and partly in the\r\nhope that physical fatigue would help her to sleep. But once out of\r\nthe house, she could not decide where to go; for she had avoided\r\nGerty since her dismissal from the milliner\xe2\x80\x99s, and she was not sure\r\nof a welcome anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe morning was in harsh contrast to the previous day. A cold grey\r\nsky threatened rain, and a high wind drove the dust in wild spirals\r\nup and down the streets. Lily walked up Fifth Avenue toward the\r\nPark, hoping to find a sheltered nook where she might sit; but the\r\nwind chilled her, and after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s wandering under the tossing\r\nboughs she yielded to her increasing weariness, and took refuge in\r\na little restaurant in Fifty-ninth Street. She was not hungry, and\r\nhad meant to go without luncheon; but she was too tired to return\r\nhome, and the long perspective of white tables showed alluringly\r\nthrough the windows.\r\n\r\nThe room was full of women and girls, all too much engaged in the\r\nrapid absorption of tea and pie to remark her entrance. A hum\r\nof shrill voices reverberated against the low ceiling, leaving\r\nLily shut out in a little circle of silence. She felt a sudden\r\npang of profound loneliness. She had lost the sense of time, and\r\nit seemed to her as though she had not spoken to any one for\r\ndays. Her eyes sought the faces about her, craving a responsive\r\nglance, some sign of an intuition of her trouble. But the sallow\r\npreoccupied women, with their bags and note-books and rolls of\r\nmusic, were all engrossed in their own affairs, and even those who\r\nsat by themselves were busy running over proof-sheets or devouring\r\nmagazines between their hurried gulps of tea. Lily alone was\r\nstranded in a great waste of disoccupation.\r\n\r\nShe drank several cups of the tea which was served with her portion\r\nof stewed oysters, and her brain felt clearer and livelier when\r\nshe emerged once more into the street. She realized now that, as\r\nshe sat in the restaurant, she had unconsciously arrived at a\r\nfinal decision. The discovery gave her an immediate illusion of\r\nactivity: it was exhilarating to think that she had actually a\r\nreason for hurrying home. To prolong her enjoyment of the sensation\r\nshe decided to walk; but the distance was so great that she found\r\nherself glancing nervously at the clocks on the way. One of the\r\nsurprises of her unoccupied state was the discovery that time, when\r\nit is left to itself and no definite demands are made on it, cannot\r\nbe trusted to move at any recognized pace. Usually it loiters; but\r\njust when one has come to count upon its slowness, it may suddenly\r\nbreak into a wild irrational gallop.\r\n\r\nShe found, however, on reaching home, that the hour was still early\r\nenough for her to sit down and rest a few minutes before putting\r\nher plan into execution. The delay did not perceptibly weaken her\r\nresolve. She was frightened and yet stimulated by the reserved\r\nforce of resolution which she felt within herself: she saw it was\r\ngoing to be easier, a great deal easier, than she had imagined.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock she rose, unlocked her trunk, and took out a\r\nsealed packet which she slipped into the bosom of her dress. Even\r\nthe contact with the packet did not shake her nerves as she had\r\nhalf-expected it would. She seemed encased in a strong armour of\r\nindifference, as though the vigorous exertion of her will had\r\nfinally benumbed her finer sensibilities.\r\n\r\nShe dressed herself once more for the street, locked her door and\r\nwent out. When she emerged on the pavement, the day was still\r\nhigh, but a threat of rain darkened the sky and cold gusts shook\r\nthe signs projecting from the basement shops along the street. She\r\nreached Fifth Avenue and began to walk slowly northward. She was\r\nsufficiently familiar with Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s habits to know that she\r\ncould always be found at home after five. She might not, indeed, be\r\naccessible to visitors, especially to a visitor so unwelcome, and\r\nagainst whom it was quite possible that she had guarded herself by\r\nspecial orders; but Lily had written a note which she meant to send\r\nup with her name, and which she thought would secure her admission.\r\n\r\nShe had allowed herself time to walk to Mrs. Dorset\xe2\x80\x99s, thinking\r\nthat the quick movement through the cold evening air would help\r\nto steady her nerves; but she really felt no need of being\r\ntranquillized. Her survey of the situation remained calm and\r\nunwavering.\r\n\r\nAs she reached Fiftieth Street the clouds broke abruptly, and\r\na rush of cold rain slanted into her face. She had no umbrella\r\nand the moisture quickly penetrated her thin spring dress. She\r\nwas still half a mile from her destination, and she decided to\r\nwalk across to Madison Avenue and take the electric car. As she\r\nturned into the side street, a vague memory stirred in her. The\r\nrow of budding trees, the new brick and limestone house-fronts,\r\nthe Georgian flat-house with flower-boxes on its balconies, were\r\nmerged together into the setting of a familiar scene. It was\r\ndown this street that she had walked with Selden, that September\r\nday two years ago; a few yards ahead was the doorway they had\r\nentered together. The recollection loosened a throng of benumbed\r\nsensations\xe2\x80\x94longings, regrets, imaginings, the throbbing brood of\r\nthe only spring her heart had ever known. It was strange to find\r\nherself passing his house on such an errand. She seemed suddenly\r\nto see her action as he would see it\xe2\x80\x94and the fact of his own\r\nconnection with it, the fact that, to attain her end, she must\r\ntrade on his name, and profit by a secret of his past, chilled her\r\nblood with shame. What a long way she had travelled since the day\r\nof their first talk together! Even then her feet had been set in\r\nthe path she was now following\xe2\x80\x94even then she had resisted the hand\r\nhe had held out.\r\n\r\nAll her resentment of his fancied coldness was swept away in this\r\noverwhelming rush of recollection. Twice he had been ready to\r\nhelp her\xe2\x80\x94to help her by loving her, as he had said\xe2\x80\x94and if, the\r\nthird time, he had seemed to fail her, whom but herself could she\r\naccuse?... Well, that part of her life was over; she did not know\r\nwhy her thoughts still clung to it. But the sudden longing to see\r\nhim remained; it grew to hunger as she paused on the pavement\r\nopposite his door. The street was dark and empty, swept by the\r\nrain. She had a vision of his quiet room, of the bookshelves,\r\nand the fire on the hearth. She looked up and saw a light in his\r\nwindow; then she crossed the street and entered the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\n\r\nThe library looked as she had pictured it. The green-shaded lamps\r\nmade tranquil circles of light in the gathering dusk, a little fire\r\nflickered on the hearth, and Selden\xe2\x80\x99s easy-chair, which stood near\r\nit, had been pushed aside when he rose to admit her.\r\n\r\nHe had checked his first movement of surprise, and stood silent,\r\nwaiting for her to speak, while she paused a moment on the\r\nthreshold, assailed by a rush of memories.\r\n\r\nThe scene was unchanged. She recognized the row of shelves from\r\nwhich he had taken down his La Bruyere, and the worn arm of the\r\nchair he had leaned against while she examined the precious volume.\r\nBut then the wide September light had filled the room, making it\r\nseem a part of the outer world: now the shaded lamps and the warm\r\nhearth, detaching it from the gathering darkness of the street,\r\ngave it a sweeter touch of intimacy.\r\n\r\nBecoming gradually aware of the surprise under Selden\xe2\x80\x99s silence,\r\nLily turned to him and said simply: \xe2\x80\x9cI came to tell you that I was\r\nsorry for the way we parted\xe2\x80\x94for what I said to you that day at Mrs.\r\nHatch\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words rose to her lips spontaneously. Even on her way up\r\nthe stairs, she had not thought of preparing a pretext for her\r\nvisit, but she now felt an intense longing to dispel the cloud of\r\nmisunderstanding that hung between them.\r\n\r\nSelden returned her look with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sorry too that we\r\nshould have parted in that way; but I am not sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it\r\non myself. Luckily I had foreseen the risk I was taking\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you really didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d broke from her with a flash of\r\nher old irony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that I was prepared for the consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected\r\ngood-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk of all this later. Do come and sit\r\nby the fire. I can recommend that arm-chair, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me put a\r\ncushion behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke she had moved slowly to the middle of the room, and\r\npaused near his writing-table, where the lamp, striking upward,\r\ncast exaggerated shadows on the pallor of her delicately-hollowed\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look tired\xe2\x80\x94do sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated gently.\r\n\r\nShe did not seem to hear the request. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted you to know that I\r\nleft Mrs. Hatch immediately after I saw you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as though\r\ncontinuing her confession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes; I know,\xe2\x80\x9d he assented, with a rising tinge of\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that I did so because you told me to. Before you came I had\r\nalready begun to see that it would be impossible to remain with\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94for the reasons you gave me; but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit it\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet you see that I understood what you meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I might have trusted you to find your own way out\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\noverwhelm me with the sense of my officiousness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis light tone, in which, had her nerves been steadier, she would\r\nhave recognized the mere effort to bridge over an awkward moment,\r\njarred on her passionate desire to be understood. In her strange\r\nstate of extra-lucidity, which gave her the sense of being already\r\nat the heart of the situation, it seemed incredible that any one\r\nshould think it necessary to linger in the conventional outskirts\r\nof word-play and evasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not that\xe2\x80\x94I was not ungrateful,\xe2\x80\x9d she insisted. But the power\r\nof expression failed her suddenly; she felt a tremor in her throat,\r\nand two tears gathered and fell slowly from her eyes.\r\n\r\nSelden moved forward and took her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very tired. Why\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down and let me make you comfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew her to the arm-chair near the fire, and placed a cushion\r\nbehind her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you must let me make you some tea: you know I always have\r\nthat amount of hospitality at my command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and two more tears ran over. But she did not\r\nweep easily, and the long habit of self-control reasserted itself,\r\nthough she was still too tremulous to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I can coax the water to boil in five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden\r\ncontinued, speaking as though she were a troubled child.\r\n\r\nHis words recalled the vision of that other afternoon when they\r\nhad sat together over his tea-table and talked jestingly of her\r\nfuture. There were moments when that day seemed more remote than\r\nany other event in her life; and yet she could always relive it in\r\nits minutest detail.\r\n\r\nShe made a gesture of refusal. \xe2\x80\x9cNo: I drink too much tea. I would\r\nrather sit quiet\xe2\x80\x94I must go in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she added confusedly.\r\n\r\nSelden continued to stand near her, leaning against the\r\nmantelpiece. The tinge of constraint was beginning to be more\r\ndistinctly perceptible under the friendly ease of his manner. Her\r\nself-absorption had not allowed her to perceive it at first; but\r\nnow that her consciousness was once more putting forth its eager\r\nfeelers, she saw that her presence was becoming an embarrassment\r\nto him. Such a situation can be saved only by an immediate outrush\r\nof feeling; and on Selden\xe2\x80\x99s side the determining impulse was still\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nThe discovery did not disturb Lily as it might once have done.\r\nShe had passed beyond the phase of well-bred reciprocity, in\r\nwhich every demonstration must be scrupulously proportioned to\r\nthe emotion it elicits, and generosity of feeling is the only\r\nostentation condemned. But the sense of loneliness returned with\r\nredoubled force as she saw herself forever shut out from Selden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninmost self. She had come to him with no definite purpose; the mere\r\nlonging to see him had directed her; but the secret hope she had\r\ncarried with her suddenly revealed itself in its death-pang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, making a motion to rise from her chair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I may not see you again for a long time, and I wanted to\r\ntell you that I have never forgotten the things you said to me at\r\nBellomont, and that sometimes\xe2\x80\x94sometimes when I seemed farthest from\r\nremembering them\xe2\x80\x94they have helped me, and kept me from mistakes;\r\nkept me from really becoming what many people have thought me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStrive as she would to put some order in her thoughts, the words\r\nwould not come more clearly; yet she felt that she could not leave\r\nhim without trying to make him understand that she had saved\r\nherself whole from the seeming ruin of her life.\r\n\r\nA change had come over Selden\xe2\x80\x99s face as she spoke. Its guarded look\r\nhad yielded to an expression still untinged by personal emotion,\r\nbut full of a gentle understanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to have you tell me that; but nothing I have said has\r\nreally made the difference. The difference is in yourself\xe2\x80\x94it will\r\nalways be there. And since it IS there, it can\xe2\x80\x99t really matter\r\nto you what people think: you are so sure that your friends will\r\nalways understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t say that what you have told me has made\r\nno difference. It seems to shut me out\xe2\x80\x94to leave me all alone\r\nwith the other people.\xe2\x80\x9d She had risen and stood before him, once\r\nmore completely mastered by the inner urgency of the moment. The\r\nconsciousness of his half-divined reluctance had vanished. Whether\r\nhe wished it or not, he must see her wholly for once before they\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nHer voice had gathered strength, and she looked him gravely in the\r\neyes as she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce\xe2\x80\x94twice\xe2\x80\x94you gave me the chance to escape\r\nfrom my life, and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward.\r\nAfterward I saw my mistake\xe2\x80\x94I saw I could never be happy with what\r\nhad contented me before. But it was too late: you had judged me\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nunderstood. It was too late for happiness\xe2\x80\x94but not too late to be\r\nhelped by the thought of what I had missed. That is all I have\r\nlived on\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t take it from me now! Even in my worst moments it has\r\nbeen like a little light in the darkness. Some women are strong\r\nenough to be good by themselves, but I needed the help of your\r\nbelief in me. Perhaps I might have resisted a great temptation, but\r\nthe little ones would have pulled me down. And then I remembered\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nremembered your saying that such a life could never satisfy me;\r\nand I was ashamed to admit to myself that it could. That is what\r\nyou did for me\xe2\x80\x94that is what I wanted to thank you for. I wanted to\r\ntell you that I have always remembered; and that I have tried\xe2\x80\x94tried\r\nhard....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off suddenly. Her tears had risen again, and in drawing\r\nout her handkerchief her fingers touched the packet in the folds\r\nof her dress. A wave of colour suffused her, and the words died on\r\nher lips. Then she lifted her eyes to his and went on in an altered\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have tried hard\xe2\x80\x94but life is difficult, and I am a very useless\r\nperson. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I\r\nwas just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and\r\nwhen I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else.\r\nWhat can one do when one finds that one only fits into one hole?\r\nOne must get back to it or be thrown out into the rubbish heap\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like in the rubbish heap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lips wavered into a smile\xe2\x80\x94she had been distracted by the\r\nwhimsical remembrance of the confidences she had made to him, two\r\nyears earlier, in that very room. Then she had been planning to\r\nmarry Percy Gryce\xe2\x80\x94what was it she was planning now?\r\n\r\nThe blood had risen strongly under Selden\xe2\x80\x99s dark skin, but his\r\nemotion showed itself only in an added seriousness of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have something to tell me\xe2\x80\x94do you mean to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\nLily\xe2\x80\x99s eyes did not falter, but a look of wonder, of puzzled\r\nself-interrogation, formed itself slowly in their depths. In\r\nthe light of his question, she had paused to ask herself if her\r\ndecision had really been taken when she entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always told me I should have to come to it sooner or later!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have come to it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to come to it\xe2\x80\x94presently. But there is something else\r\nI must come to first.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused again, trying to transmit to her\r\nvoice the steadiness of her recovered smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some one\r\nI must say goodbye to. Oh, not YOU\xe2\x80\x94we are sure to see each other\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94but the Lily Bart you knew. I have kept her with me all this\r\ntime, but now we are going to part, and I have brought her back\r\nto you\xe2\x80\x94I am going to leave her here. When I go out presently she\r\nwill not go with me. I shall like to think that she has stayed with\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be no trouble, she\xe2\x80\x99ll take up no room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went toward him, and put out her hand, still smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\nlet her stay with you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe caught her hand, and she felt in his the vibration of feeling\r\nthat had not yet risen to his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cLily\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him gently. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what you said to me\r\nonce? That you could help me only by loving me? Well\xe2\x80\x94you did love\r\nme for a moment; and it helped me. It has always helped me. But the\r\nmoment is gone\xe2\x80\x94it was I who let it go. And one must go on living.\r\nGoodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laid her other hand on his, and they looked at each other with\r\na kind of solemnity, as though they stood in the presence of death.\r\nSomething in truth lay dead between them\xe2\x80\x94the love she had killed in\r\nhim and could no longer call to life. But something lived between\r\nthem also, and leaped up in her like an imperishable flame: it was\r\nthe love his love had kindled, the passion of her soul for his.\r\n\r\nIn its light everything else dwindled and fell away from her. She\r\nunderstood now that she could not go forth and leave her old self\r\nwith him: that self must indeed live on in his presence, but it\r\nmust still continue to be hers.\r\n\r\nSelden had retained her hand, and continued to scrutinize her with\r\na strange sense of foreboding. The external aspect of the situation\r\nhad vanished for him as completely as for her: he felt it only as\r\none of those rare moments which lift the veil from their faces as\r\nthey pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLily,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t speak in this way. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t let you go without knowing what you mean to do. Things may\r\nchange\xe2\x80\x94but they don\xe2\x80\x99t pass. You can never go out of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe met his eyes with an illumined look. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nthat now. Let us always be friends. Then I shall feel safe,\r\nwhatever happens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens? What do you mean? What is going to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away quietly and walked toward the hearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at present\xe2\x80\x94except that I am very cold, and that before I\r\ngo you must make up the fire for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt on the hearth-rug, stretching her hands to the embers.\r\nPuzzled by the sudden change in her tone, he mechanically gathered\r\na handful of wood from the basket and tossed it on the fire. As he\r\ndid so, he noticed how thin her hands looked against the rising\r\nlight of the flames. He saw too, under the loose lines of her\r\ndress, how the curves of her figure had shrunk to angularity; he\r\nremembered long afterward how the red play of the flame sharpened\r\nthe depression of her nostrils, and intensified the blackness of\r\nthe shadows which struck up from her cheekbones to her eyes. She\r\nknelt there for a few moments in silence; a silence which he dared\r\nnot break. When she rose he fancied that he saw her draw something\r\nfrom her dress and drop it into the fire; but he hardly noticed\r\nthe gesture at the time. His faculties seemed tranced, and he was\r\nstill groping for the word to break the spell. She went up to him\r\nand laid her hands on his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodbye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and as he\r\nbent over her she touched his forehead with her lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 13\r\n\r\n\r\nThe street-lamps were lit, but the rain had ceased, and there was\r\na momentary revival of light in the upper sky. Lily walked on\r\nunconscious of her surroundings. She was still treading the buoyant\r\nether which emanates from the high moments of life. But gradually\r\nit shrank away from her and she felt the dull pavement beneath\r\nher feet. The sense of weariness returned with accumulated force,\r\nand for a moment she felt that she could walk no farther. She had\r\nreached the corner of Forty-first Street and Fifth Avenue, and she\r\nremembered that in Bryant Park there were seats where she might\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThat melancholy pleasure-ground was almost deserted when she\r\nentered it, and she sank down on an empty bench in the glare of\r\nan electric street-lamp. The warmth of the fire had passed out of\r\nher veins, and she told herself that she must not sit long in the\r\npenetrating dampness which struck up from the wet asphalt. But her\r\nwill-power seemed to have spent itself in a last great effort, and\r\nshe was lost in the blank reaction which follows on an unwonted\r\nexpenditure of energy. And besides, what was there to go home to?\r\nNothing but the silence of her cheerless room\xe2\x80\x94that silence of the\r\nnight which may be more racking to tired nerves than the most\r\ndiscordant noises: that, and the bottle of chloral by her bed.\r\nThe thought of the chloral was the only spot of light in the dark\r\nprospect: she could feel its lulling influence stealing over her\r\nalready. But she was troubled by the thought that it was losing\r\nits power\xe2\x80\x94she dared not go back to it too soon. Of late the sleep\r\nit had brought her had been more broken and less profound; there\r\nhad been nights when she was perpetually floating up through it\r\nto consciousness. What if the effect of the drug should gradually\r\nfail, as all narcotics were said to fail? She remembered the\r\nchemist\xe2\x80\x99s warning against increasing the dose; and she had heard\r\nbefore of the capricious and incalculable action of the drug. Her\r\ndread of returning to a sleepless night was so great that she\r\nlingered on, hoping that excessive weariness would reinforce the\r\nwaning power of the chloral.\r\n\r\nNight had now closed in, and the roar of traffic in Forty-second\r\nStreet was dying out. As complete darkness fell on the square the\r\nlingering occupants of the benches rose and dispersed; but now and\r\nthen a stray figure, hurrying homeward, struck across the path\r\nwhere Lily sat, looming black for a moment in the white circle of\r\nelectric light. One or two of these passers-by slackened their\r\npace to glance curiously at her lonely figure; but she was hardly\r\nconscious of their scrutiny.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, however, she became aware that one of the passing shadows\r\nremained stationary between her line of vision and the gleaming\r\nasphalt; and raising her eyes she saw a young woman bending over\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me\xe2\x80\x94are you sick?\xe2\x80\x94Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Bart!\xe2\x80\x9d a half-familiar\r\nvoice exclaimed.\r\n\r\nLily looked up. The speaker was a poorly-dressed young woman\r\nwith a bundle under her arm. Her face had the air of unwholesome\r\nrefinement which ill-health and over-work may produce, but its\r\ncommon prettiness was redeemed by the strong and generous curve of\r\nthe lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember me,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, brightening with the\r\npleasure of recognition, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d know you anywhere, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought\r\nof you such a lot. I guess my folks all know your name by heart.\r\nI was one of the girls at Miss Farish\xe2\x80\x99s club\xe2\x80\x94you helped me to go\r\nto the country that time I had lung-trouble. My name\xe2\x80\x99s Nettie\r\nStruther. It was Nettie Crane then\xe2\x80\x94but I daresay you don\xe2\x80\x99t remember\r\nthat either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes: Lily was beginning to remember. The episode of Nettie Crane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntimely rescue from disease had been one of the most satisfying\r\nincidents of her connection with Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s charitable work. She had\r\nfurnished the girl with the means to go to a sanatorium in the\r\nmountains: it struck her now with a peculiar irony that the money\r\nshe had used had been Gus Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe tried to reply, to assure the speaker that she had not\r\nforgotten; but her voice failed in the effort, and she felt herself\r\nsinking under a great wave of physical weakness. Nettie Struther,\r\nwith a startled exclamation, sat down and slipped a shabbily-clad\r\narm behind her back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Miss Bart, you ARE sick. Just lean on me a little till you\r\nfeel better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA faint glow of returning strength seemed to pass into Lily from\r\nthe pressure of the supporting arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only tired\xe2\x80\x94it is nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d she found voice to say in a moment;\r\nand then, as she met the timid appeal of her companion\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, she\r\nadded involuntarily: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been unhappy\xe2\x80\x94in great trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYOU in trouble? I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought of you as being so high up,\r\nwhere everything was just grand. Sometimes, when I felt real mean,\r\nand got to wondering why things were so queerly fixed in the world,\r\nI used to remember that you were having a lovely time, anyhow, and\r\nthat seemed to show there was a kind of justice somewhere. But\r\nyou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t sit here too long\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s fearfully damp. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel\r\nstrong enough to walk on a little ways now?\xe2\x80\x9d she broke off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes; I must go home,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily murmured, rising.\r\n\r\nHer eyes rested wonderingly on the thin shabby figure at her side.\r\nShe had known Nettie Crane as one of the discouraged victims of\r\nover-work and anaemic parentage: one of the superfluous fragments\r\nof life destined to be swept prematurely into that social\r\nrefuse-heap of which Lily had so lately expressed her dread. But\r\nNettie Struther\xe2\x80\x99s frail envelope was now alive with hope and\r\nenergy: whatever fate the future reserved for her, she would not be\r\ncast into the refuse-heap without a struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to have seen you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lily continued, summoning a\r\nsmile to her unsteady lips. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be my turn to think of you as\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94and the world will seem a less unjust place to me too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t leave you like this\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re not fit to go home\r\nalone. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t go with you either!\xe2\x80\x9d Nettie Struther wailed\r\nwith a start of recollection. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it\xe2\x80\x99s my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnight-shift\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a motor-man\xe2\x80\x94and the friend I leave the baby with\r\nhas to step upstairs to get HER husband\xe2\x80\x99s supper at seven. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell you I had a baby, did I? She\xe2\x80\x99ll be four months old day after\r\ntomorrow, and to look at her you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d ever had a sick\r\nday. I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to show you the baby, Miss Bart, and we live\r\nright down the street here\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s only three blocks off.\xe2\x80\x9d She lifted\r\nher eyes tentatively to Lily\xe2\x80\x99s face, and then added with a burst\r\nof courage: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you get right into the cars and come home\r\nwith me while I get baby\xe2\x80\x99s supper? It\xe2\x80\x99s real warm in our kitchen,\r\nand you can rest there, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take YOU home as soon as ever she\r\ndrops off to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt WAS warm in the kitchen, which, when Nettie Struther\xe2\x80\x99s match had\r\nmade a flame leap from the gas-jet above the table, revealed itself\r\nto Lily as extraordinarily small and almost miraculously clean. A\r\nfire shone through the polished flanks of the iron stove, and near\r\nit stood a crib in which a baby was sitting upright, with incipient\r\nanxiety struggling for expression on a countenance still placid\r\nwith sleep.\r\n\r\nHaving passionately celebrated her reunion with her offspring, and\r\nexcused herself in cryptic language for the lateness of her return,\r\nNettie restored the baby to the crib and shyly invited Miss Bart to\r\nthe rocking-chair near the stove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a parlour too,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained with pardonable pride;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s warmer in here, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you\r\nalone while I\xe2\x80\x99m getting baby\xe2\x80\x99s supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn receiving Lily\xe2\x80\x99s assurance that she much preferred the friendly\r\nproximity of the kitchen fire, Mrs. Struther proceeded to prepare a\r\nbottle of infantile food, which she tenderly applied to the baby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpatient lips; and while the ensuing degustation went on, she\r\nseated herself with a beaming countenance beside her visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t let me warm up a drop of coffee for you,\r\nMiss Bart? There\xe2\x80\x99s some of baby\xe2\x80\x99s fresh milk left over\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nmaybe you\xe2\x80\x99d rather just sit quiet and rest a little while. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntoo lovely having you here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it so often that I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s really come true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to George again\r\nand again: \xe2\x80\x98I just wish Miss Bart could see me NOW\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 and I used\r\nto watch for your name in the papers, and we\xe2\x80\x99d talk over what you\r\nwere doing, and read the descriptions of the dresses you wore. I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t seen your name for a long time, though, and I began to be\r\nafraid you were sick, and it worried me so that George said I\xe2\x80\x99d get\r\nsick myself, fretting about it.\xe2\x80\x9d Her lips broke into a reminiscent\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be sick again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact: the\r\nlast spell nearly finished me. When you sent me off that time I\r\nnever thought I\xe2\x80\x99d come back alive, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t much care if I did.\r\nYou see I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about George and the baby then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused to readjust the bottle to the child\xe2\x80\x99s bubbling mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou precious\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you be in too much of a hurry! Was it mad with\r\nmommer for getting its supper so late? Marry Anto\xe2\x80\x99nette\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nwe call her: after the French queen in that play at the Garden\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ntold George the actress reminded me of you, and that made me fancy\r\nthe name.... I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d get married, you know, and I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nnever have had the heart to go on working just for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe broke off again, and meeting the encouragement in Lily\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nwent on, with a flush rising under her anaemic skin: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t only just SICK that time you sent me off\xe2\x80\x94I was dreadfully\r\nunhappy too. I\xe2\x80\x99d known a gentleman where I was employed\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow as you remember I did type-writing in a big importing\r\nfirm\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94I thought we were to be married: he\xe2\x80\x99d gone steady\r\nwith me six months and given me his mother\xe2\x80\x99s wedding ring. But I\r\npresume he was too stylish for me\xe2\x80\x94he travelled for the firm, and\r\nhad seen a great deal of society. Work girls aren\xe2\x80\x99t looked after\r\nthe way you are, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t always know how to look after\r\nthemselves. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t . . . and it pretty near killed me when he\r\nwent away and left off writing....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was then I came down sick\xe2\x80\x94I thought it was the end of\r\neverything. I guess it would have been if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sent me off.\r\nBut when I found I was getting well I began to take heart in spite\r\nof myself. And then, when I got back home, George came round and\r\nasked me to marry him. At first I thought I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen brought up together, and I knew he knew about me. But after a\r\nwhile I began to see that that made it easier. I never could have\r\ntold another man, and I\xe2\x80\x99d never have married without telling; but\r\nif George cared for me enough to have me as I was, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see why\r\nI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin over again\xe2\x80\x94and I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe strength of the victory shone forth from her as she lifted\r\nher irradiated face from the child on her knees. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, mercy, I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to go on like this about myself, with you sitting there\r\nlooking so fagged out. Only it\xe2\x80\x99s so lovely having you here, and\r\nletting you see just how you\xe2\x80\x99ve helped me.\xe2\x80\x9d The baby had sunk back\r\nblissfully replete, and Mrs. Struther softly rose to lay the bottle\r\naside. Then she paused before Miss Bart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wish I could help YOU\xe2\x80\x94but I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on\r\nearth I could do,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured wistfully.\r\n\r\nLily, instead of answering, rose with a smile and held out her\r\narms; and the mother, understanding the gesture, laid her child in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe baby, feeling herself detached from her habitual anchorage,\r\nmade an instinctive motion of resistance; but the soothing\r\ninfluences of digestion prevailed, and Lily felt the soft weight\r\nsink trustfully against her breast. The child\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in its\r\nsafety thrilled her with a sense of warmth and returning life, and\r\nshe bent over, wondering at the rosy blur of the little face, the\r\nempty clearness of the eyes, the vague tendrilly motions of the\r\nfolding and unfolding fingers. At first the burden in her arms\r\nseemed as light as a pink cloud or a heap of down, but as she\r\ncontinued to hold it the weight increased, sinking deeper, and\r\npenetrating her with a strange sense of weakness, as though the\r\nchild entered into her and became a part of herself.\r\n\r\nShe looked up, and saw Nettie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes resting on her with tenderness\r\nand exultation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be too lovely for anything if she could grow up to be\r\njust like you? Of course I know she never COULD\xe2\x80\x94but mothers are\r\nalways dreaming the craziest things for their children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLily clasped the child close for a moment and laid her back in her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she must not do that\xe2\x80\x94I should be afraid to come and see\r\nher too often!\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a smile; and then, resisting Mrs.\r\nStruther\xe2\x80\x99s anxious offer of companionship, and reiterating the\r\npromise that of course she would come back soon, and make George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacquaintance, and see the baby in her bath, she passed out of the\r\nkitchen and went alone down the tenement stairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs she reached the street she realized that she felt stronger\r\nand happier: the little episode had done her good. It was the\r\nfirst time she had ever come across the results of her spasmodic\r\nbenevolence, and the surprised sense of human fellowship took the\r\nmortal chill from her heart.\r\n\r\nIt was not till she entered her own door that she felt the reaction\r\nof a deeper loneliness. It was long after seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the\r\nlight and odours proceeding from the basement made it manifest that\r\nthe boarding-house dinner had begun. She hastened up to her room,\r\nlit the gas, and began to dress. She did not mean to pamper herself\r\nany longer, to go without food because her surroundings made it\r\nunpalatable. Since it was her fate to live in a boarding-house, she\r\nmust learn to fall in with the conditions of the life. Nevertheless\r\nshe was glad that, when she descended to the heat and glare of the\r\ndining-room, the repast was nearly over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn her own room again, she was seized with a sudden fever of\r\nactivity. For weeks past she had been too listless and indifferent\r\nto set her possessions in order, but now she began to examine\r\nsystematically the contents of her drawers and cupboard. She had a\r\nfew handsome dresses left\xe2\x80\x94survivals of her last phase of splendour,\r\non the Sabrina and in London\xe2\x80\x94but when she had been obliged to\r\npart with her maid she had given the woman a generous share of\r\nher cast-off apparel. The remaining dresses, though they had lost\r\ntheir freshness, still kept the long unerring lines, the sweep\r\nand amplitude of the great artist\xe2\x80\x99s stroke, and as she spread\r\nthem out on the bed the scenes in which they had been worn rose\r\nvividly before her. An association lurked in every fold: each fall\r\nof lace and gleam of embroidery was like a letter in the record\r\nof her past. She was startled to find how the atmosphere of her\r\nold life enveloped her. But, after all, it was the life she had\r\nbeen made for: every dawning tendency in her had been carefully\r\ndirected toward it, all her interests and activities had been\r\ntaught to centre around it. She was like some rare flower grown for\r\nexhibition, a flower from which every bud had been nipped except\r\nthe crowning blossom of her beauty.\r\n\r\nLast of all, she drew forth from the bottom of her trunk a heap\r\nof white drapery which fell shapelessly across her arm. It was\r\nthe Reynolds dress she had worn in the Bry TABLEAUX. It had been\r\nimpossible for her to give it away, but she had never seen it since\r\nthat night, and the long flexible folds, as she shook them out,\r\ngave forth an odour of violets which came to her like a breath\r\nfrom the flower-edged fountain where she had stood with Lawrence\r\nSelden and disowned her fate. She put back the dresses one by one,\r\nlaying away with each some gleam of light, some note of laughter,\r\nsome stray waft from the rosy shores of pleasure. She was still in\r\na state of highly-wrought impressionability, and every hint of the\r\npast sent a lingering tremor along her nerves.\r\n\r\nShe had just closed her trunk on the white folds of the Reynolds\r\ndress when she heard a tap at her door, and the red fist of the\r\nIrish maid-servant thrust in a belated letter. Carrying it to the\r\nlight, Lily read with surprise the address stamped on the upper\r\ncorner of the envelope. It was a business communication from the\r\noffice of her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s executors, and she wondered what unexpected\r\ndevelopment had caused them to break silence before the appointed\r\ntime. She opened the envelope and a cheque fluttered to the floor.\r\nAs she stooped to pick it up the blood rushed to her face. The\r\ncheque represented the full amount of Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, and\r\nthe letter accompanying it explained that the executors, having\r\nadjusted the business of the estate with less delay than they had\r\nexpected, had decided to anticipate the date fixed for the payment\r\nof the bequests.\r\n\r\nLily sat down beside the desk at the foot of her bed, and spreading\r\nout the cheque, read over and over the TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS written\r\nacross it in a steely business hand. Ten months earlier the amount\r\nit stood for had represented the depths of penury; but her standard\r\nof values had changed in the interval, and now visions of wealth\r\nlurked in every flourish of the pen. As she continued to gaze at\r\nit, she felt the glitter of the visions mounting to her brain,\r\nand after a while she lifted the lid of the desk and slipped the\r\nmagic formula out of sight. It was easier to think without those\r\nfive figures dancing before her eyes; and she had a great deal of\r\nthinking to do before she slept.\r\n\r\nShe opened her cheque-book, and plunged into such anxious\r\ncalculations as had prolonged her vigil at Bellomont on the night\r\nwhen she had decided to marry Percy Gryce. Poverty simplifies\r\nbook-keeping, and her financial situation was easier to ascertain\r\nthan it had been then; but she had not yet learned the control of\r\nmoney, and during her transient phase of luxury at the Emporium she\r\nhad slipped back into habits of extravagance which still impaired\r\nher slender balance. A careful examination of her cheque-book, and\r\nof the unpaid bills in her desk, showed that, when the latter had\r\nbeen settled, she would have barely enough to live on for the next\r\nthree or four months; and even after that, if she were to continue\r\nher present way of living, without earning any additional money,\r\nall incidental expenses must be reduced to the vanishing point.\r\nShe hid her eyes with a shudder, beholding herself at the entrance\r\nof that ever-narrowing perspective down which she had seen Miss\r\nSilverton\xe2\x80\x99s dowdy figure take its despondent way.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer, however, from the vision of material poverty that\r\nshe turned with the greatest shrinking. She had a sense of deeper\r\nimpoverishment\xe2\x80\x94of an inner destitution compared to which outward\r\nconditions dwindled into insignificance. It was indeed miserable to\r\nbe poor\xe2\x80\x94to look forward to a shabby, anxious middle-age, leading\r\nby dreary degrees of economy and self-denial to gradual absorption\r\nin the dingy communal existence of the boarding-house. But there\r\nwas something more miserable still\xe2\x80\x94it was the clutch of solitude at\r\nher heart, the sense of being swept like a stray uprooted growth\r\ndown the heedless current of the years. That was the feeling which\r\npossessed her now\xe2\x80\x94the feeling of being something rootless and\r\nephemeral, mere spin-drift of the whirling surface of existence,\r\nwithout anything to which the poor little tentacles of self could\r\ncling before the awful flood submerged them. And as she looked\r\nback she saw that there had never been a time when she had had any\r\nreal relation to life. Her parents too had been rootless, blown\r\nhither and thither on every wind of fashion, without any personal\r\nexistence to shelter them from its shifting gusts. She herself had\r\ngrown up without any one spot of earth being dearer to her than\r\nanother: there was no centre of early pieties, of grave endearing\r\ntraditions, to which her heart could revert and from which it could\r\ndraw strength for itself and tenderness for others. In whatever\r\nform a slowly-accumulated past lives in the blood\xe2\x80\x94whether in the\r\nconcrete image of the old house stored with visual memories, or\r\nin the conception of the house not built with hands, but made\r\nup of inherited passions and loyalties\xe2\x80\x94it has the same power of\r\nbroadening and deepening the individual existence, of attaching\r\nit by mysterious links of kinship to all the mighty sum of human\r\nstriving.\r\n\r\nSuch a vision of the solidarity of life had never before come to\r\nLily. She had had a premonition of it in the blind motions of her\r\nmating-instinct; but they had been checked by the disintegrating\r\ninfluences of the life about her. All the men and women she\r\nknew were like atoms whirling away from each other in some wild\r\ncentrifugal dance: her first glimpse of the continuity of life had\r\ncome to her that evening in Nettie Struther\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe poor little working-girl who had found strength to gather up\r\nthe fragments of her life, and build herself a shelter with them,\r\nseemed to Lily to have reached the central truth of existence. It\r\nwas a meagre enough life, on the grim edge of poverty, with scant\r\nmargin for possibilities of sickness or mischance, but it had the\r\nfrail audacious permanence of a bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest built on the edge of a\r\ncliff\xe2\x80\x94a mere wisp of leaves and straw, yet so put together that the\r\nlives entrusted to it may hang safely over the abyss.\r\n\r\nYes\xe2\x80\x94but it had taken two to build the nest; the man\xe2\x80\x99s faith as well\r\nas the woman\xe2\x80\x99s courage. Lily remembered Nettie\xe2\x80\x99s words: I KNEW HE\r\nKNEW ABOUT ME. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s faith in her had made her renewal\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94it is so easy for a woman to become what the man she loves\r\nbelieves her to be! Well\xe2\x80\x94Selden had twice been ready to stake his\r\nfaith on Lily Bart; but the third trial had been too severe for\r\nhis endurance. The very quality of his love had made it the more\r\nimpossible to recall to life. If it had been a simple instinct of\r\nthe blood, the power of her beauty might have revived it. But the\r\nfact that it struck deeper, that it was inextricably wound up with\r\ninherited habits of thought and feeling, made it as impossible to\r\nrestore to growth as a deep-rooted plant torn from its bed. Selden\r\nhad given her of his best; but he was as incapable as herself of an\r\nuncritical return to former states of feeling.\r\n\r\nThere remained to her, as she had told him, the uplifting memory\r\nof his faith in her; but she had not reached the age when a woman\r\ncan live on her memories. As she held Nettie Struther\xe2\x80\x99s child in\r\nher arms the frozen currents of youth had loosed themselves and\r\nrun warm in her veins: the old life-hunger possessed her, and all\r\nher being clamoured for its share of personal happiness. Yes\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas happiness she still wanted, and the glimpse she had caught of\r\nit made everything else of no account. One by one she had detached\r\nherself from the baser possibilities, and she saw that nothing now\r\nremained to her but the emptiness of renunciation.\r\n\r\nIt was growing late, and an immense weariness once more possessed\r\nher. It was not the stealing sense of sleep, but a vivid wakeful\r\nfatigue, a wan lucidity of mind against which all the possibilities\r\nof the future were shadowed forth gigantically. She was appalled\r\nby the intense cleanness of the vision; she seemed to have broken\r\nthrough the merciful veil which intervenes between intention and\r\naction, and to see exactly what she would do in all the long\r\ndays to come. There was the cheque in her desk, for instance\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nmeant to use it in paying her debt to Trenor; but she foresaw\r\nthat when the morning came she would put off doing so, would slip\r\ninto gradual tolerance of the debt. The thought terrified her\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ndreaded to fall from the height of her last moment with Lawrence\r\nSelden. But how could she trust herself to keep her footing?\r\nShe knew the strength of the opposing impulses\xe2\x80\x94she could feel\r\nthe countless hands of habit dragging her back into some fresh\r\ncompromise with fate. She felt an intense longing to prolong,\r\nto perpetuate, the momentary exaltation of her spirit. If only\r\nlife could end now\xe2\x80\x94end on this tragic yet sweet vision of lost\r\npossibilities, which gave her a sense of kinship with all the\r\nloving and foregoing in the world!\r\n\r\nShe reached out suddenly and, drawing the cheque from her\r\nwriting-desk, enclosed it in an envelope which she addressed to\r\nher bank. She then wrote out a cheque for Trenor, and placing it,\r\nwithout an accompanying word, in an envelope inscribed with his\r\nname, laid the two letters side by side on her desk. After that\r\nshe continued to sit at the table, sorting her papers and writing,\r\ntill the intense silence of the house reminded her of the lateness\r\nof the hour. In the street the noise of wheels had ceased, and\r\nthe rumble of the \xe2\x80\x9celevated\xe2\x80\x9d came only at long intervals through\r\nthe deep unnatural hush. In the mysterious nocturnal separation\r\nfrom all outward signs of life, she felt herself more strangely\r\nconfronted with her fate. The sensation made her brain reel,\r\nand she tried to shut out consciousness by pressing her hands\r\nagainst her eyes. But the terrible silence and emptiness seemed to\r\nsymbolize her future\xe2\x80\x94she felt as though the house, the street, the\r\nworld were all empty, and she alone left sentient in a lifeless\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nBut this was the verge of delirium . . . she had never hung so\r\nnear the dizzy brink of the unreal. Sleep was what she wanted\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nremembered that she had not closed her eyes for two nights. The\r\nlittle bottle was at her bed-side, waiting to lay its spell upon\r\nher. She rose and undressed hastily, hungering now for the touch of\r\nher pillow. She felt so profoundly tired that she thought she must\r\nfall asleep at once; but as soon as she had lain down every nerve\r\nstarted once more into separate wakefulness. It was as though a\r\ngreat blaze of electric light had been turned on in her head, and\r\nher poor little anguished self shrank and cowered in it, without\r\nknowing where to take refuge.\r\n\r\nShe had not imagined that such a multiplication of wakefulness\r\nwas possible: her whole past was reenacting itself at a hundred\r\ndifferent points of consciousness. Where was the drug that could\r\nstill this legion of insurgent nerves? The sense of exhaustion\r\nwould have been sweet compared to this shrill beat of activities;\r\nbut weariness had dropped from her as though some cruel stimulant\r\nhad been forced into her veins.\r\n\r\nShe could bear it\xe2\x80\x94yes, she could bear it; but what strength would\r\nbe left her the next day? Perspective had disappeared\xe2\x80\x94the next day\r\npressed close upon her, and on its heels came the days that were to\r\nfollow\xe2\x80\x94they swarmed about her like a shrieking mob. She must shut\r\nthem out for a few hours; she must take a brief bath of oblivion.\r\nShe put out her hand, and measured the soothing drops into a glass;\r\nbut as she did so, she knew they would be powerless against the\r\nsupernatural lucidity of her brain. She had long since raised the\r\ndose to its highest limit, but tonight she felt she must increase\r\nit. She knew she took a slight risk in doing so\xe2\x80\x94she remembered\r\nthe chemist\xe2\x80\x99s warning. If sleep came at all, it might be a sleep\r\nwithout waking. But after all that was but one chance in a hundred:\r\nthe action of the drug was incalculable, and the addition of a few\r\ndrops to the regular dose would probably do no more than procure\r\nfor her the rest she so desperately needed....\r\n\r\nShe did not, in truth, consider the question very closely\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nphysical craving for sleep was her only sustained sensation. Her\r\nmind shrank from the glare of thought as instinctively as eyes\r\ncontract in a blaze of light\xe2\x80\x94darkness, darkness was what she must\r\nhave at any cost. She raised herself in bed and swallowed the\r\ncontents of the glass; then she blew out her candle and lay down.\r\n\r\nShe lay very still, waiting with a sensuous pleasure for the first\r\neffects of the soporific. She knew in advance what form they would\r\ntake\xe2\x80\x94the gradual cessation of the inner throb, the soft approach\r\nof passiveness, as though an invisible hand made magic passes over\r\nher in the darkness. The very slowness and hesitancy of the effect\r\nincreased its fascination: it was delicious to lean over and look\r\ndown into the dim abysses of unconsciousness. Tonight the drug\r\nseemed to work more slowly than usual: each passionate pulse had to\r\nbe stilled in turn, and it was long before she felt them dropping\r\ninto abeyance, like sentinels falling asleep at their posts. But\r\ngradually the sense of complete subjugation came over her, and she\r\nwondered languidly what had made her feel so uneasy and excited.\r\nShe saw now that there was nothing to be excited about\xe2\x80\x94she had\r\nreturned to her normal view of life. Tomorrow would not be so\r\ndifficult after all: she felt sure that she would have the strength\r\nto meet it. She did not quite remember what it was that she had\r\nbeen afraid to meet, but the uncertainty no longer troubled her.\r\nShe had been unhappy, and now she was happy\xe2\x80\x94she had felt herself\r\nalone, and now the sense of loneliness had vanished.\r\n\r\nShe stirred once, and turned on her side, and as she did so, she\r\nsuddenly understood why she did not feel herself alone. It was\r\nodd\xe2\x80\x94but Nettie Struther\xe2\x80\x99s child was lying on her arm: she felt\r\nthe pressure of its little head against her shoulder. She did not\r\nknow how it had come there, but she felt no great surprise at the\r\nfact, only a gentle penetrating thrill of warmth and pleasure.\r\nShe settled herself into an easier position, hollowing her arm to\r\npillow the round downy head, and holding her breath lest a sound\r\nshould disturb the sleeping child.\r\n\r\nAs she lay there she said to herself that there was something she\r\nmust tell Selden, some word she had found that should make life\r\nclear between them. She tried to repeat the word, which lingered\r\nvague and luminous on the far edge of thought\xe2\x80\x94she was afraid of not\r\nremembering it when she woke; and if she could only remember it and\r\nsay it to him, she felt that everything would be well.\r\n\r\nSlowly the thought of the word faded, and sleep began to enfold\r\nher. She struggled faintly against it, feeling that she ought\r\nto keep awake on account of the baby; but even this feeling was\r\ngradually lost in an indistinct sense of drowsy peace, through\r\nwhich, of a sudden, a dark flash of loneliness and terror tore its\r\nway.\r\n\r\nShe started up again, cold and trembling with the shock: for a\r\nmoment she seemed to have lost her hold of the child. But no\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwas mistaken\xe2\x80\x94the tender pressure of its body was still close to\r\nhers: the recovered warmth flowed through her once more, she\r\nyielded to it, sank into it, and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning rose mild and bright, with a promise of summer\r\nin the air. The sunlight slanted joyously down Lily\xe2\x80\x99s street,\r\nmellowed the blistered house-front, gilded the paintless railings\r\nof the doorstep, and struck prismatic glories from the panes of her\r\ndarkened window.\r\n\r\nWhen such a day coincides with the inner mood there is intoxication\r\nin its breath; and Selden, hastening along the street through the\r\nsqualor of its morning confidences, felt himself thrilling with a\r\nyouthful sense of adventure. He had cut loose from the familiar\r\nshores of habit, and launched himself on uncharted seas of emotion;\r\nall the old tests and measures were left behind, and his course was\r\nto be shaped by new stars.\r\n\r\nThat course, for the moment, led merely to Miss Bart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboarding-house; but its shabby doorstep had suddenly become the\r\nthreshold of the untried. As he approached he looked up at the\r\ntriple row of windows, wondering boyishly which one of them\r\nwas hers. It was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the house, being tenanted\r\nby workers, already showed an awakened front to the street. He\r\nremembered afterward having noticed that only one blind was down.\r\nHe noticed too that there was a pot of pansies on one of the window\r\nsills, and at once concluded that the window must be hers: it was\r\ninevitable that he should connect her with the one touch of beauty\r\nin the dingy scene.\r\n\r\nNine o\xe2\x80\x99clock was an early hour for a visit, but Selden had passed\r\nbeyond all such conventional observances. He only knew that he must\r\nsee Lily Bart at once\xe2\x80\x94he had found the word he meant to say to her,\r\nand it could not wait another moment to be said. It was strange\r\nthat it had not come to his lips sooner\xe2\x80\x94that he had let her pass\r\nfrom him the evening before without being able to speak it. But\r\nwhat did that matter, now that a new day had come? It was not a\r\nword for twilight, but for the morning.\r\n\r\nSelden ran eagerly up the steps and pulled the bell; and even in\r\nhis state of self-absorption it came as a sharp surprise to him\r\nthat the door should open so promptly. It was still more of a\r\nsurprise to see, as he entered, that it had been opened by Gerty\r\nFarish\xe2\x80\x94and that behind her, in an agitated blur, several other\r\nfigures ominously loomed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLawrence!\xe2\x80\x9d Gerty cried in a strange voice, \xe2\x80\x9chow could you get\r\nhere so quickly?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the trembling hand she laid on him seemed\r\ninstantly to close about his heart.\r\n\r\nHe noticed the other faces, vague with fear and conjecture\xe2\x80\x94he saw\r\nthe landlady\xe2\x80\x99s imposing bulk sway professionally toward him; but\r\nhe shrank back, putting up his hand, while his eyes mechanically\r\nmounted the steep black walnut stairs, up which he was immediately\r\naware that his cousin was about to lead him.\r\n\r\nA voice in the background said that the doctor might be back at any\r\nminute\xe2\x80\x94and that nothing, upstairs, was to be disturbed. Some one\r\nelse exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the greatest mercy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d then Selden felt that\r\nGerty had taken him gently by the hand, and that they were to be\r\nsuffered to go up alone.\r\n\r\nIn silence they mounted the three flights, and walked along the\r\npassage to a closed door. Gerty opened the door, and Selden went\r\nin after her. Though the blind was down, the irresistible sunlight\r\npoured a tempered golden flood into the room, and in its light\r\nSelden saw a narrow bed along the wall, and on the bed, with\r\nmotionless hands and calm unrecognizing face, the semblance of Lily\r\nBart.\r\n\r\nThat it was her real self, every pulse in him ardently denied. Her\r\nreal self had lain warm on his heart but a few hours earlier\xe2\x80\x94what\r\nhad he to do with this estranged and tranquil face which, for the\r\nfirst time, neither paled nor brightened at his coming?\r\n\r\nGerty, strangely tranquil too, with the conscious self-control of\r\none who has ministered to much pain, stood by the bed, speaking\r\ngently, as if transmitting a final message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor found a bottle of chloral\xe2\x80\x94she had been sleeping badly\r\nfor a long time, and she must have taken an overdose by mistake....\r\nThere is no doubt of that\xe2\x80\x94no doubt\xe2\x80\x94there will be no question\xe2\x80\x94he has\r\nbeen very kind. I told him that you and I would like to be left\r\nalone with her\xe2\x80\x94to go over her things before any one else comes. I\r\nknow it is what she would have wished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden was hardly conscious of what she said. He stood looking down\r\non the sleeping face which seemed to lie like a delicate impalpable\r\nmask over the living lineaments he had known. He felt that the real\r\nLily was still there, close to him, yet invisible and inaccessible;\r\nand the tenuity of the barrier between them mocked him with a sense\r\nof helplessness. There had never been more than a little impalpable\r\nbarrier between them\xe2\x80\x94and yet he had suffered it to keep them apart!\r\nAnd now, though it seemed slighter and frailer than ever, it had\r\nsuddenly hardened to adamant, and he might beat his life out\r\nagainst it in vain.\r\n\r\nHe had dropped on his knees beside the bed, but a touch from Gerty\r\naroused him. He stood up, and as their eyes met he was struck by\r\nthe extraordinary light in his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand what the doctor has gone for? He has promised that\r\nthere shall be no trouble\xe2\x80\x94but of course the formalities must be\r\ngone through. And I asked him to give us time to look through her\r\nthings first\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and she glanced about the small bare room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake long,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long,\xe2\x80\x9d he agreed.\r\n\r\nShe held his hand in hers a moment longer, and then, with a last\r\nlook at the bed, moved silently toward the door. On the threshold\r\nshe paused to add: \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find me downstairs if you want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSelden roused himself to detain her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you going? She\r\nwould have wished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGerty shook her head with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNo: this is what she would have\r\nwished\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and as she spoke a light broke through Selden\xe2\x80\x99s stony\r\nmisery, and he saw deep into the hidden things of love.\r\n\r\nThe door closed on Gerty, and he stood alone with the motionless\r\nsleeper on the bed. His impulse was to return to her side, to fall\r\non his knees, and rest his throbbing head against the peaceful\r\ncheek on the pillow. They had never been at peace together, they\r\ntwo; and now he felt himself drawn downward into the strange\r\nmysterious depths of her tranquillity.\r\n\r\nBut he remembered Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s warning words\xe2\x80\x94he knew that, though time\r\nhad ceased in this room, its feet were hastening relentlessly\r\ntoward the door. Gerty had given him this supreme half hour, and he\r\nmust use it as she willed.\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked about him, sternly compelling himself to\r\nregain his consciousness of outward things. There was very little\r\nfurniture in the room. The shabby chest of drawers was spread\r\nwith a lace cover, and set out with a few gold-topped boxes and\r\nbottles, a rose-coloured pin-cushion, a glass tray strewn with\r\ntortoise-shell hair-pins\xe2\x80\x94he shrank from the poignant intimacy of\r\nthese trifles, and from the blank surface of the toilet-mirror\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nThese were the only traces of luxury, of that clinging to the\r\nminute observance of personal seemliness, which showed what her\r\nother renunciations must have cost. There was no other token\r\nof her personality about the room, unless it showed itself in\r\nthe scrupulous neatness of the scant articles of furniture: a\r\nwashing-stand, two chairs, a small writing-desk, and the little\r\ntable near the bed. On this table stood the empty bottle and glass,\r\nand from these also he averted his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe desk was closed, but on its slanting lid lay two letters which\r\nhe took up. One bore the address of a bank, and as it was stamped\r\nand sealed, Selden, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, laid it aside. On\r\nthe other letter he read Gus Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s name; and the flap of the\r\nenvelope was still ungummed.\r\n\r\nTemptation leapt on him like the stab of a knife. He staggered\r\nunder it, steadying himself against the desk. Why had she been\r\nwriting to Trenor\xe2\x80\x94writing, presumably, just after their parting\r\nof the previous evening? The thought unhallowed the memory of\r\nthat last hour, made a mock of the word he had come to speak, and\r\ndefiled even the reconciling silence upon which it fell. He felt\r\nhimself flung back on all the ugly uncertainties from which he\r\nthought he had cast loose forever. After all, what did he know of\r\nher life? Only as much as she had chosen to show him, and measured\r\nby the world\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, how little that was! By what right\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nletter in his hand seemed to ask\xe2\x80\x94by what right was it he who now\r\npassed into her confidence through the gate which death had left\r\nunbarred? His heart cried out that it was by right of their last\r\nhour together, the hour when she herself had placed the key in\r\nhis hand. Yes\xe2\x80\x94but what if the letter to Trenor had been written\r\nafterward?\r\n\r\nHe put it from him with sudden loathing, and setting his lips,\r\naddressed himself resolutely to what remained of his task. After\r\nall, that task would be easier to perform, now that his personal\r\nstake in it was annulled.\r\n\r\nHe raised the lid of the desk, and saw within it a cheque-book\r\nand a few packets of bills and letters, arranged with the orderly\r\nprecision which characterized all her personal habits. He looked\r\nthrough the letters first, because it was the most difficult part\r\nof the work. They proved to be few and unimportant, but among them\r\nhe found, with a strange commotion of the heart, the note he had\r\nwritten her the day after the Brys\xe2\x80\x99 entertainment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen may I come to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his words overwhelmed him with a\r\nrealization of the cowardice which had driven him from her at the\r\nvery moment of attainment. Yes\xe2\x80\x94he had always feared his fate, and\r\nhe was too honest to disown his cowardice now; for had not all his\r\nold doubts started to life again at the mere sight of Trenor\xe2\x80\x99s name?\r\n\r\nHe laid the note in his card-case, folding it away carefully, as\r\nsomething made precious by the fact that she had held it so; then,\r\ngrowing once more aware of the lapse of time, he continued his\r\nexamination of the papers.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, he found that all the bills were receipted; there\r\nwas not an unpaid account among them. He opened the cheque-book,\r\nand saw that, the very night before, a cheque of ten thousand\r\ndollars from Mrs. Peniston\xe2\x80\x99s executors had been entered in it.\r\nThe legacy, then, had been paid sooner than Gerty had led him\r\nto expect. But, turning another page or two, he discovered with\r\nastonishment that, in spite of this recent accession of funds, the\r\nbalance had already declined to a few dollars. A rapid glance at\r\nthe stubs of the last cheques, all of which bore the date of the\r\nprevious day, showed that between four or five hundred dollars of\r\nthe legacy had been spent in the settlement of bills, while the\r\nremaining thousands were comprehended in one cheque, made out, at\r\nthe same time, to Charles Augustus Trenor.\r\n\r\nSelden laid the book aside, and sank into the chair beside the\r\ndesk. He leaned his elbows on it, and hid his face in his hands.\r\nThe bitter waters of life surged high about him, their sterile\r\ntaste was on his lips. Did the cheque to Trenor explain the mystery\r\nor deepen it? At first his mind refused to act\xe2\x80\x94he felt only the\r\ntaint of such a transaction between a man like Trenor and a girl\r\nlike Lily Bart. Then, gradually, his troubled vision cleared,\r\nold hints and rumours came back to him, and out of the very\r\ninsinuations he had feared to probe, he constructed an explanation\r\nof the mystery. It was true, then, that she had taken money from\r\nTrenor; but true also, as the contents of the little desk declared,\r\nthat the obligation had been intolerable to her, and that at the\r\nfirst opportunity she had freed herself from it, though the act\r\nleft her face to face with bare unmitigated poverty.\r\n\r\nThat was all he knew\xe2\x80\x94all he could hope to unravel of the story.\r\nThe mute lips on the pillow refused him more than this\xe2\x80\x94unless\r\nindeed they had told him the rest in the kiss they had left upon\r\nhis forehead. Yes, he could now read into that farewell all that\r\nhis heart craved to find there; he could even draw from it courage\r\nnot to accuse himself for having failed to reach the height of his\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nHe saw that all the conditions of life had conspired to keep them\r\napart; since his very detachment from the external influences which\r\nswayed her had increased his spiritual fastidiousness, and made it\r\nmore difficult for him to live and love uncritically. But at least\r\nhe HAD loved her\xe2\x80\x94had been willing to stake his future on his faith\r\nin her\xe2\x80\x94and if the moment had been fated to pass from them before\r\nthey could seize it, he saw now that, for both, it had been saved\r\nwhole out of the ruin of their lives.\r\n\r\nIt was this moment of love, this fleeting victory over themselves,\r\nwhich had kept them from atrophy and extinction; which, in her, had\r\nreached out to him in every struggle against the influence of her\r\nsurroundings, and in him, had kept alive the faith that now drew\r\nhim penitent and reconciled to her side.\r\n\r\nHe knelt by the bed and bent over her, draining their last moment\r\nto its lees; and in the silence there passed between them the word\r\nwhich made all clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transcriber\xe2\x80\x99s Note=:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
