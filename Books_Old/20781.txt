In the first place, both background and\r\ncharacters ring true. The air of the Alps is wafted to us in every\r\npage; the house among the pines, the meadows, and the eagle poised\r\nabove the naked rocks form a picture that no one could willingly\r\nforget. And the people, from the kindly towns-folk to the quaint and\r\ntouching peasant types, are as real as any representation of human\r\nnature need be. Every goat even, has its personality. As for the\r\nlittle heroine, she is a blessing not only to everyone in the story,\r\nbut to everyone who reads it. The narrative merits of the book are too\r\napparent to call for comment.\r\n\r\nAs to the author, Johanna Spyri, she has so entirely lost herself in\r\nher creation that we may pass over her career rather rapidly. She was\r\nborn in Switzerland in 1829, came of a literary family, and devoted\r\nall her talent to the writing of books for and about children.\r\n\r\nSince "Heidi" has been so often translated into English it may well be\r\nasked why there is any need for a new version. The answer lies partly\r\nin the conventional character of the previous translations. Now, if\r\nthere is any quality in "Heidi" that gives it a particular charm, that\r\nquality is freshness, absolute spontaneity. To be sure, the story is\r\nso attractive that it could never be wholly spoiled; but has not the\r\nreader the right to enjoy it in English at least very nearly as much\r\nas he could in German? The two languages are so different in nature\r\nthat anything like a literal rendering of one into the other is sure\r\nto result in awkwardness and indirectness. Such a book must be not\r\ntranslated, but re-lived and re-created.\r\n\r\nTo perform such a feat the writer must, to begin with, be familiar\r\nwith the mountains, and able to appreciate with Wordsworth\r\n\r\n    The silence that is in the starry sky,\r\n    The sleep that is among the lonely hills.\r\n\r\nThe translator of the present version was born and reared in a region\r\nclosely similar to that of the story. Her home was originally in the\r\npicturesque town of Salzburg, and her father, Franz von Pausinger, was\r\none of the greatest landscape painters of his country and generation.\r\nAnother equally important requisite is knowledge of children. It\r\nhappens that this translator has a daughter just the age of the\r\nheroine, who moreover loves to dress in Tyrolese costume. To translate\r\n"Heidi" was for her therefore a labor of love, which means that the\r\nlove contended with and overcame the labor.\r\n\r\nThe English style of the present version is, then, distinctive. It has\r\noften been noticed that those who acquire a foreign language often\r\nlearn to speak it with unusual clearness and purity. For illustration\r\nwe need go no further than Joseph Conrad, a Pole, probably the\r\ngreatest master of narrative English writing to-day; or to our own\r\nfellow-citizen Carl Schurz. In the present case, the writer has lived\r\nseven years in America and has strengthened an excellent training with\r\na wide reading of the best English classics.\r\n\r\nMany people say that they read without noticing the author\'s style.\r\nThis is seldom quite true; unconsciously every one is impressed in\r\nsome way or other by the style of every book, or by its lack of style.\r\nChildren are particularly sensitive in this respect and should,\r\ntherefore, as much as is practicable, read only the best. In the new\r\ntranslation of "Heidi" here offered to the public I believe that most\r\nreaders will notice an especial flavor, that very quality of delight\r\nin mountain scenes, in mountain people and in child life generally,\r\nwhich is one of the chief merits of the German original. The phrasing\r\nhas also been carefully adapted to the purpose of reading aloud--a\r\nthing that few translators think of. In conclusion, the author,\r\nrealising the difference between the two languages, has endeavored to\r\nwrite the story afresh, as Johanna Spyri would have written it had\r\nEnglish been her native tongue. How successful the attempt has been\r\nthe reader will judge.\r\n\r\n                                    CHARLES WHARTON STORK\r\n                            Assistant Professor of English at the\r\n                                   University of Pennsylvania\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nHEIDI\'S YEARS OF LEARNING AND TRAVEL\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                      PAGE\r\n    I.

From it a\r\nfootpath leads through green, well-wooded stretches to the foot of the\r\nheights which look down imposingly upon the valley. Where the footpath\r\nbegins to go steeply and abruptly up the Alps, the heath, with its\r\nshort grass and pungent herbage, at once sends out its soft perfume to\r\nmeet the wayfarer.\r\n\r\nOne bright sunny morning in June, a tall, vigorous maiden of the\r\nmountain region climbed up the narrow path, leading a little girl by\r\nthe hand. The youngster\'s cheeks were in such a glow that it showed\r\neven through her sun-browned skin. Small wonder though! for in spite\r\nof the heat, the little one, who was scarcely five years old, was\r\nbundled up as if she had to brave a bitter frost. Her shape was\r\ndifficult to distinguish, for she wore two dresses, if not three, and\r\naround her shoulders a large red cotton shawl. With her feet encased\r\nin heavy hob-nailed boots, this hot and shapeless little person toiled\r\nup the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe pair had been climbing for about an hour when they reached a\r\nhamlet half-way up the great mountain named the Alm. This hamlet was\r\ncalled "Im Doerfli" or "The Little Village." It was the elder girl\'s\r\nhome town, and therefore she was greeted from nearly every house;\r\npeople called to her from windows and doors, and very often from the\r\nroad. But, answering questions and calls as she went by, the girl did\r\nnot loiter on her way and only stood still when she reached the end of\r\nthe hamlet. There a few cottages lay scattered about, from the\r\nfurthest of which a voice called out to her through an open door:\r\n"Deta, please wait one moment! I am coming with you, if you are going\r\nfurther up."\r\n\r\nWhen the girl stood still to wait, the child instantly let go her hand\r\nand promptly sat down on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Are you tired, Heidi?" Deta asked the child.\r\n\r\n"No, but hot," she replied.\r\n\r\n"We shall be up in an hour, if you take big steps and climb with all\r\nyour little might!" Thus the elder girl tried to encourage her small\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nA stout, pleasant-looking woman stepped out of the house and joined\r\nthe two. The child had risen and wandered behind the old\r\nacquaintances, who immediately started gossiping about their friends\r\nin the neighborhood and the people of the hamlet generally.\r\n\r\n"Where are you taking the child, Deta?" asked the newcomer. "Is she\r\nthe child your sister left?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Deta assured her; "I am taking her up to the Alm-Uncle and\r\nthere I want her to remain."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t really mean to take her there Deta. You must have lost your\r\nsenses, to go to him. I am sure the old man will show you the door and\r\nwon\'t even listen to what you say."\r\n\r\n"Why not? As he\'s her grandfather, it is high time he should do\r\nsomething for the child. I have taken care of her until this summer\r\nand now a good place has been offered to me. The child shall not\r\nhinder me from accepting it, I tell you that!"\r\n\r\n"It would not be so hard, if he were like other mortals. But you know\r\nhim yourself. How could he _look_ after a child, especially such a\r\nlittle one? She\'ll never get along with him, I am sure of that!--But\r\ntell me of your prospects."\r\n\r\n"I am going to a splendid house in Frankfurt. Last summer some people\r\nwent off to the baths and I took care of their rooms. As they got to\r\nlike me, they wanted to take me along, but I could not leave. They\r\nhave come back now and have persuaded me to go with them."\r\n\r\n"I am glad I am not the child!" exclaimed Barbara with a shudder.\r\n"Nobody knows anything about the old man\'s life up there. He doesn\'t\r\nspeak to a living soul, and from one year\'s end to the other he keeps\r\naway from church. People get out of his way when he appears once in a\r\ntwelve-month down here among us. We all fear him and he is really just\r\nlike a heathen or an old Indian, with those thick grey eyebrows and\r\nthat huge uncanny beard. When he wanders along the road with his\r\ntwisted stick we are all afraid to meet him alone."\r\n\r\n"That is not my fault," said Deta stubbornly. "He won\'t do her any\r\nharm; and if he should, he is responsible, not I."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew what weighs on the old man\'s conscience. Why are his\r\neyes so fierce and why does he live up there all alone? Nobody ever\r\nsees him and we hear many strange things about him. Didn\'t your sister\r\ntell you anything, Deta?"\r\n\r\n"Of course she did, but I shall hold my tongue. He would make me pay\r\nfor it if I didn\'t."\r\n\r\nBarbara had long been anxious to know something about the old uncle\r\nand why he lived apart from everybody. Nobody had a good word for him,\r\nand when people talked about him, they did not speak openly but as if\r\nthey were afraid. She could not even explain to herself why he was\r\ncalled the Alm-Uncle. He could not possibly be the uncle of all the\r\npeople in the village, but since everybody spoke of him so, she did\r\nthe same. Barbara, who had only lived in the village since her\r\nmarriage, was glad to get some information from her friend. Deta had\r\nbeen bred there, but since her mother\'s death had gone away to earn\r\nher livelihood.\r\n\r\nShe confidentially seized Deta\'s arm and said: "I wish you would tell\r\nme the truth about him, Deta; you know it all--people only gossip.\r\nTell me, what has happened to the old man to turn everybody against\r\nhim so? Did he always hate his fellow-creatures?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you whether he always did, and that for a very good\r\nreason. He being sixty years old, and I only twenty-six, you can\'t\r\nexpect me to give you an account of his early youth. But if you\'ll\r\npromise to keep it to yourself and not set all the people in Praetiggan\r\ntalking, I can tell you a good deal. My mother and he both came from\r\nDomleschg."\r\n\r\n"How can you talk like that, Deta?" replied Barbara in an offended\r\ntone. "People do not gossip much in Praetiggan, and I always can keep\r\nthings to myself, if I have to. You won\'t repent of having told me, I\r\nassure you!"\r\n\r\n"All right, but keep your word!" said Deta warningly. Then she looked\r\naround to see that the child was not so close to them as to overhear\r\nwhat might be said; but the little girl was nowhere to be seen. While\r\nthe two young women had talked at such a rate, they had not noticed\r\nher absence; quite a while must have elapsed since the little girl had\r\ngiven up following her companions. Deta, standing still, looked about\r\nher everywhere, but no one was on the path, which--except for a few\r\ncurves--was visible as far down as the village.\r\n\r\n"There she is! Can\'t you see her there?" exclaimed Barbara, pointing\r\nto a spot a good distance from the path. "She is climbing up with the\r\ngoatherd Peter and his goats. I wonder why he is so late to-day. I\r\nmust say, it suits us well enough; he can look after the child while\r\nyou tell me everything without being interrupted."\r\n\r\n"It will be very easy for Peter to watch her," remarked Deta; "she is\r\nbright for her five years and keeps her eyes wide open. I have often\r\nnoticed that and I am glad for her, for it will be useful with the\r\nuncle. He has nothing left in the whole wide world, but his cottage\r\nand two goats!"\r\n\r\n"Did he once have more?" asked Barbara.\r\n\r\n"I should say so. He was heir to a large farm in Domleschg. But\r\nsetting up to play the fine gentleman, he soon lost everything with\r\ndrink and play. His parents died with grief and he himself\r\ndisappeared from these parts. After many years he came back with a\r\nhalf-grown boy, his son, Tobias, that was his name, became a carpenter\r\nand turned out to be a quiet, steady fellow. Many strange rumors went\r\nround about the uncle and I think that was why he left Domleschg for\r\nDoerfli. We acknowledged relationship, my mother\'s grandmother being a\r\ncousin of his. We called him uncle, and because we are related on my\r\nfather\'s side to nearly all the people in the hamlet they too all\r\ncalled him uncle. He was named \'Alm-Uncle\' when he moved up to the\r\nAlm."\r\n\r\n"But what happened to Tobias?" asked Barbara eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Just wait. How can I tell you everything at once?" exclaimed Deta.\r\n"Tobias was an apprentice in Mels, and when he was made master, he\r\ncame home to the village and married my sister Adelheid. They always\r\nhad been fond of each other and they lived very happily as man and\r\nwife. But their joy was short. Two years afterwards, when Tobias was\r\nhelping to build a house, a beam fell on him and killed him. Adelheid\r\nwas thrown into a violent fever with grief and fright, and never\r\nrecovered from it. She had never been strong and had often suffered\r\nfrom queer spells, when we did not know whether she was awake or\r\nasleep. Only a few weeks after Tobias\'s death they buried poor\r\nAdelheid.\r\n\r\n"People said that heaven had punished the uncle for his misdeeds.\r\nAfter the death of his son he never spoke to a living soul. Suddenly\r\nhe moved up to the Alp, to live there at enmity with God and man.\r\n\r\n"My mother and I took Adelheid\'s little year-old baby, Heidi, to live\r\nwith us. When I went to Ragatz I took her with me; but in the spring\r\nthe family whose work I had done last year came from Frankfurt and\r\nresolved to take me to their town-house. I am very glad to get such a\r\ngood position."\r\n\r\n"And now you want to hand over the child to this terrible old man. I\r\nreally wonder how you can do it, Deta!" said Barbara with reproach in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me I have really done enough for the child. I do not know\r\nwhere else to take her, as she is too young to come with me to\r\nFrankfurt. By the way, Barbara, where are you going? We are half-way\r\nup the Alm already."\r\n\r\nDeta shook hands with her companion and stood still while Barbara\r\napproached the tiny, dark-brown mountain hut, which lay in a hollow a\r\nfew steps away from the path.\r\n\r\nSituated half-way up the Alm, the cottage was luckily protected from\r\nthe mighty winds. Had it been exposed to the tempests, it would have\r\nbeen a doubtful habitation in the state of decay it was in. Even as it\r\nwas, the doors and windows rattled and the old rafters shook when the\r\nsouth wind swept the mountain side. If the hut had stood on the Alm\r\ntop, the wind would have blown it down the valley without much ado\r\nwhen the storm season came.\r\n\r\nHere lived Peter the goatherd, a boy eleven years old, who daily\r\nfetched the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to\r\nthe short and luscious grasses of the pastures. Peter raced down in\r\nthe evening with the light-footed little goats. When he whistled\r\nsharply through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her\r\ngoat. These owners were mostly small boys and girls and, as the goats\r\nwere friendly, they did not fear them. That was the only time Peter\r\nspent with other children, the rest of the day the animals were his\r\nsole companions. At home lived his mother and an old blind\r\ngrandmother, but he only spent enough time in the hut to swallow his\r\nbread and milk for breakfast and the same repast for supper. After\r\nthat he sought his bed to sleep. He always left early in the morning\r\nand at night he came home late, so that he could be with his friends\r\nas long as possible. His father had met with an accident some years\r\nago; he also had been called Peter the goatherd. His mother, whose\r\nname was Brigida, was called "Goatherd Peter\'s wife" and his blind\r\ngrandmother was called by young and old from many miles about just\r\n"grandmother."\r\n\r\nDeta waited about ten minutes to see if the children were coming up\r\nbehind with the goats. As she could not find them anywhere, she\r\nclimbed up a little higher to get a better view down the valley from\r\nthere, and peered from side to side with marks of great impatience on\r\nher countenance.\r\n\r\nThe children in the meantime were ascending slowly in a zigzag way,\r\nPeter always knowing where to find all sorts of good grazing places\r\nfor his goats where they could nibble. Thus they strayed from side to\r\nside. The poor little girl had followed the boy only with the greatest\r\neffort and she was panting in her heavy clothes. She was so hot and\r\nuncomfortable that she only climbed by exerting all her strength. She\r\ndid not say anything but looked enviously at Peter, who jumped about\r\nso easily in his light trousers and bare feet. She envied even more\r\nthe goats that climbed over bushes, stones, and steep inclines with\r\ntheir slender legs. Suddenly sitting down on the ground the child\r\nswiftly took off her shoes and stockings. Getting up she undid the\r\nheavy shawl and the two little dresses. Out she slipped without more\r\nado and stood up in only a light petticoat. In sheer delight at the\r\nrelief, she threw up her dimpled arms, that were bare up to her short\r\nsleeves. To save the trouble of carrying them, her aunt had dressed\r\nher in her Sunday clothes over her workday garments. Heidi arranged\r\nher dresses neatly in a heap and joined Peter and the goats. She was\r\nnow as light-footed as any of them. When Peter, who had not paid much\r\nattention, saw her suddenly in her light attire, he grinned. Looking\r\nback, he saw the little heap of dresses on the ground and then he\r\ngrinned yet more, till his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear; but\r\nhe said never a word.\r\n\r\nThe child, feeling free and comfortable, started to converse with\r\nPeter, and he had to answer many questions. She asked him how many\r\ngoats he had, and where he led them, what he did with them when he got\r\nthere, and so forth.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: SHE UNDID THE HEAVY SHAWL AND THE TWO LITTLE\r\n   DRESSES]\r\n\r\nAt last the children reached the summit in front of the hut. When Deta\r\nsaw the little party of climbers she cried out shrilly: "Heidi, what\r\nhave you done? What a sight you are! Where are your dresses and your\r\nshawl? Are the new shoes gone that I just bought for you, and the new\r\nstockings that I made myself? Where are they all, Heidi?"\r\n\r\nThe child quietly pointed down and said "There."\r\n\r\nThe aunt followed the direction of her finger and descried a little\r\nheap with a small red dot in the middle, which she recognized as the\r\nshawl.\r\n\r\n"Unlucky child!" Deta said excitedly. "What does all this mean? Why\r\nhave you taken your things all off?"\r\n\r\n"Because I do not need them," said the child, not seeming in the least\r\nrepentant of her deed.\r\n\r\n"How can you be so stupid, Heidi? Have you lost your senses?" the aunt\r\nwent on, in a tone of mingled vexation and reproach. "Who do you think\r\nwill go way down there to fetch those things up again? It is\r\nhalf-an-hour\'s walk. Please, Peter, run down and get them. Do not\r\nstand and stare at me as if you were glued to the spot."\r\n\r\n"I am late already," replied Peter, and stood without moving from the\r\nplace where, with his hands in his trousers\' pockets, he had witnessed\r\nthe violent outbreak of Heidi\'s aunt.\r\n\r\n"There you are, standing and staring, but that won\'t get you further,"\r\nsaid Deta. "I\'ll give you this if you go down." With that she held a\r\nfive-penny-piece under his eyes. That made Peter start and in a great\r\nhurry he ran down the straightest path. He arrived again in so short a\r\ntime that Deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without\r\ndelay. He did not often get such a treasure, and therefore his face\r\nwas beaming and he laughingly dropped the money deep into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"If you are going up to the uncle, as we are, you can carry the pack\r\ntill we get there," said Deta. They still had to climb a steep ascent\r\nthat lay behind Peter\'s hut. The boy readily took the things and\r\nfollowed Deta, his left arm holding the bundle and his right swinging\r\nthe stick. Heidi jumped along gaily by his side with the goats.\r\n\r\nAfter three quarters of an hour they reached the height where the hut\r\nof the old man stood on a prominent rock, exposed to every wind, but\r\nbathed in the full sunlight. From there you could gaze far down into\r\nthe valley. Behind the hut stood three old fir-trees with great shaggy\r\nbranches. Further back the old grey rocks rose high and sheer. Above\r\nthem you could see green and fertile pastures, till at last the stony\r\nboulders reached the bare, steep cliffs.\r\n\r\nOverlooking the valley the uncle had made himself a bench, by the side\r\nof the hut. Here he sat, with his pipe between his teeth and both\r\nhands resting on his knees. He quietly watched the children climbing\r\nup with the goats and Aunt Deta behind them, for the children had\r\ncaught up to her long ago. Heidi reached the top first, and\r\napproaching the old man she held out her hand to him and said: "Good\r\nevening, grandfather!"\r\n\r\n"Well, well, what does that mean?" replied the old man in a rough\r\nvoice. Giving her his hand for only a moment, he watched her with a\r\nlong and penetrating look from under his bushy brows. Heidi gazed back\r\nat him with an unwinking glance and examined him with much curiosity,\r\nfor he was strange to look at, with his thick, grey beard and shaggy\r\neyebrows, that met in the middle like a thicket.\r\n\r\nHeidi\'s aunt had arrived in the meantime with Peter, who was eager to\r\nsee what was going to happen.\r\n\r\n"Good-day to you, uncle," said Deta as she approached. "This is\r\nTobias\'s and Adelheid\'s child. You won\'t be able to remember her,\r\nbecause last time you saw her she was scarcely a year old."\r\n\r\n"Why do you bring her here?" asked the uncle, and turning to Peter he\r\nsaid: "Get away and bring my goats. How late you are already!"\r\n\r\nPeter obeyed and disappeared on the spot; the uncle had looked at him\r\nin such a manner that he was glad to go.\r\n\r\n"Uncle, I have brought the little girl for you to keep," said Deta. "I\r\nhave done my share these last four years and now it is your turn to\r\nprovide for her."\r\n\r\nThe old man\'s eyes flamed with anger. "Indeed!" he said. "What on\r\nearth shall I do, when she begins to whine and cry for you? Small\r\nchildren always do, and then I\'ll be helpless."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to look out for that!" Deta retorted. "When the little\r\nbaby was left in my hands a few years ago, I had to find out how to\r\ncare for the little innocent myself and nobody told me anything. I\r\nalready had mother on my hands and there was plenty for me to do. You\r\ncan\'t blame me if I want to earn some money now. If you can\'t keep the\r\nchild, you can do with her whatever you please. If she comes to harm\r\nyou are responsible and I am sure you do not want to burden your\r\nconscience any further."\r\n\r\nDeta had said more in her excitement than she had intended, just\r\nbecause her conscience was not quite clear. The uncle had risen during\r\nher last words and now he gave her such a look that she retreated a\r\nfew steps. Stretching out his arm in a commanding gesture, he said to\r\nher: "Away with you! Begone! Stay wherever you came from and don\'t\r\nventure soon again into my sight!"\r\n\r\nDeta did not have to be told twice. She said "Good-bye" to Heidi and\r\n"Farewell" to the uncle, and started down the mountain. Like steam her\r\nexcitement seemed to drive her forward, and she ran down at a\r\ntremendous rate. The people in the village called to her now more than\r\nthey had on her way up, because they all were wondering where she had\r\nleft the child. They were well acquainted with both and knew their\r\nhistory. When she heard from door and windows: "Where is the child?"\r\n"Where have you left her, Deta?" and so forth, she answered more and\r\nmore reluctantly: "Up with the Alm-Uncle,--with the Alm-Uncle!" She\r\nbecame much provoked because the women called to her from every side:\r\n"How could you do it?" "The poor little creature!" "The idea of\r\nleaving such a helpless child up there!" and, over and over again:\r\n"The poor little dear!" Deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad\r\nwhen she heard no more calls, because, to tell the truth, she herself\r\nwas uneasy. Her mother had asked her on her deathbed to care for\r\nHeidi. But she consoled herself with the thought that she would be\r\nable to do more for the child if she could earn some money. She was\r\nvery glad to go away from people who interfered in her affairs, and\r\nlooked forward with great delight to her new place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWITH THE GRANDFATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Deta had disappeared, the Uncle sat down again on the bench,\r\nblowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe. He did not speak, but\r\nkept his eyes fastened on the ground. In the meantime Heidi looked\r\nabout her, and discovering the goat-shed, peeped in. Nothing could be\r\nseen inside. Searching for some more interesting thing, she saw the\r\nthree old fir-trees behind the hut. Here the wind was roaring through\r\nthe branches and the tree-tops were swaying to and fro. Heidi stood\r\nstill to listen. After the wind had ceased somewhat, she walked round\r\nthe hut back to her grandfather. She found him in exactly the same\r\nposition, and planting herself in front of the old man, with arms\r\nfolded behind her back, she gazed at him. The grandfather, looking up,\r\nsaw the child standing motionless before him. "What do you want to do\r\nnow?" he asked her.\r\n\r\n"I want to see what\'s in the hut," replied Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Come then," and with that the grandfather got up and entered the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\n"Take your things along," he commanded.\r\n\r\n"I do not want them any more," answered Heidi.\r\n\r\nThe old man, turning about, threw a penetrating glance at her. The\r\nchild\'s black eyes were sparkling in expectation of all the things to\r\ncome. "She is not lacking in intelligence," he muttered to himself.\r\nAloud he added: "Why don\'t you need them any more?"\r\n\r\n"I want to go about like the light-footed goats!"\r\n\r\n"All right, you can; but fetch the things and we\'ll put them in the\r\ncupboard." The child obeyed the command. The old man now opened the\r\ndoor, and Heidi followed him into a fairly spacious room, which took\r\nin the entire expanse of the hut. In one corner stood a table and a\r\nchair, and in another the grandfather\'s bed. Across the room a large\r\nkettle was suspended over the hearth, and opposite to it a large door\r\nwas sunk into the wall. This the grandfather opened. It was the\r\ncupboard, in which all his clothes were kept. In one shelf were a few\r\nshirts, socks and towels; on another a few plates, cups and glasses;\r\nand on the top shelf Heidi could see a round loaf of bread, some bacon\r\nand cheese. In this cupboard the grandfather kept everything that he\r\nneeded for his subsistence. When he opened it, Heidi pushed her things\r\nas far behind the grandfather\'s clothes as she could reach. She did\r\nnot want them found again in a hurry. After looking around attentively\r\nin the room, she asked, "Where am I going to sleep, grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"Wherever you want to," he replied. That suited Heidi exactly. She\r\npeeped into all the corners of the room and looked at every little\r\nnook to find a cosy place to sleep. Beside the old man\'s bed she saw a\r\nladder. Climbing up, she arrived at a hayloft, which was filled with\r\nfresh and fragrant hay. Through a tiny round window she could look far\r\ndown into the valley.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: HERE A NEAT LITTLE BED WAS PREPARED]\r\n\r\n"I want to sleep up here," Heidi called down. "Oh, it is lovely here.\r\nPlease come up, grandfather, and see it for yourself."\r\n\r\n"I know it," sounded from below.\r\n\r\n"I am making the bed now," the little girl called out again, while she\r\nran busily to and fro. "Oh, do come up and bring a sheet, grandfather,\r\nfor every bed must have a sheet."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" said the old man. After a while he opened the cupboard\r\nand rummaged around in it. At last he pulled out a long coarse cloth\r\nfrom under the shirts. It somewhat resembled a sheet, and with this he\r\nclimbed up to the loft. Here a neat little bed was already prepared.\r\nOn top the hay was heaped up high so that the head of the occupant\r\nwould lie exactly opposite the window.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather was well pleased with the arrangement. To prevent the\r\nhard floor from being felt, he made the couch twice as thick. Then he\r\nand Heidi together put the heavy sheet on, tucking the ends in well.\r\nHeidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said,\r\n"Grandfather, we have forgotten something."\r\n\r\n"What?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I have no cover. When I go to bed I always creep in between the sheet\r\nand the cover."\r\n\r\n"What shall we do if I haven\'t any?" asked the grandfather.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, I\'ll just take some more hay to cover me," Heidi\r\nreassured him, and was just going to the heap of hay when the old man\r\nstopped her.\r\n\r\n"Just wait one minute," he said, and went down to his own bed. From it\r\nhe took a large, heavy linen bag and brought it to the child.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this better than hay?" he asked.\r\n\r\nHeidi pulled the sack to and fro with all her might, but she could not\r\nunfold it, for it was too heavy for her little arms. The grandfather\r\nput the thick cover on the bed while Heidi watched him. After it was\r\nall done, she said: "What a nice bed I have now, and what a splendid\r\ncover! I only wish the evening was here, that I might go to sleep in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I think we might eat something first," said the grandfather. "Don\'t\r\nyou think so?"\r\n\r\nHeidi had forgotten everything else in her interest for the bed; but\r\nwhen she was reminded of her dinner, she noticed how terribly hungry\r\nshe really was. She had had only a piece of bread and a cup of thin\r\ncoffee very early in the morning, before her long journey. Heidi said\r\napprovingly: "I think we might, grandfather!"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go down then, if we agree," said the old man, and followed\r\nclose behind her. Going up to the fireplace, he pushed the big kettle\r\naside and reached for a smaller one that was suspended on a chain.\r\nThen sitting down on a three-legged stool, he kindled a bright fire.\r\nWhen the kettle was boiling, the old man put a large piece of cheese\r\non a long iron fork, and held it over the fire, turning it to and fro,\r\ntill it was golden-brown on all sides. Heidi had watched him eagerly.\r\nSuddenly she ran to the cupboard. When her grandfather brought a pot\r\nand the toasted cheese to the table, he found it already nicely set\r\nwith two plates and two knives and the bread in the middle. Heidi had\r\nseen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for\r\nthe meal.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see that you can think for yourself," said the\r\ngrandfather, while he put the cheese on top of the bread, "but\r\nsomething is missing yet."\r\n\r\nHeidi saw the steaming pot and ran back to the cupboard in all haste.\r\nA single little bowl was on the shelf. That did not perplex Heidi\r\nthough, for she saw two glasses standing behind. With those three\r\nthings she returned to the table.\r\n\r\n"You certainly can help yourself! Where shall you sit, though?" asked\r\nthe grandfather, who occupied the only chair himself, Heidi flew to\r\nthe hearth, and bringing back the little stool, sat down on it.\r\n\r\n"Now you have a seat, but it is much too low. In fact, you are too\r\nlittle to reach the table from my chair. Now you shall have something\r\nto eat at last!" and with that the grandfather filled the little bowl\r\nwith milk. Putting it on his chair, he pushed it as near to the stool\r\nas was possible, and in that way Heidi had a table before her. He\r\ncommanded her to eat the large piece of bread and the slice of golden\r\ncheese. He sat down himself on a corner of the table and started his\r\nown dinner. Heidi drank without stopping, for she felt exceedingly\r\nthirsty after her long journey. Taking a long breath, she put down her\r\nlittle bowl.\r\n\r\n"How do you like the milk?" the grandfather asked her.\r\n\r\n"I never tasted better," answered Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Then you shall have more," and with that the grandfather filled the\r\nlittle bowl again. The little girl ate and drank with the greatest\r\nenjoyment. After she was through, both went out into the goat-shed.\r\nHere the old man busied himself, and Heidi watched him attentively\r\nwhile he was sweeping and putting down fresh straw for the goats to\r\nsleep on. Then he went to the little shop alongside and fashioned a\r\nhigh chair for Heidi, to the little girl\'s greatest amazement.\r\n\r\n"What is this?" asked the grandfather.\r\n\r\n"This is a chair for me. I am sure of it because it is so high. How\r\nquickly it was made!" said the child, full of admiration and wonder.\r\n\r\n"She knows what is what and has her eyes on the right place," the\r\ngrandfather said to himself, while he walked around the hut, fastening\r\na nail or a loose board here and there. He wandered about with his\r\nhammer and nails, repairing whatever was in need of fixing. Heidi\r\nfollowed him at every step and watched the performance with great\r\nenjoyment and attention.\r\n\r\nAt last the evening came. The old fir-trees were rustling and a mighty\r\nwind was roaring and howling through the tree-tops. Those sounds\r\nthrilled Heidi\'s heart and filled it with happiness and joy. She\r\ndanced and jumped about under the trees, for those sounds made her\r\nfeel as if a wonderful thing had happened to her. The grandfather\r\nstood under the door, watching her, when suddenly a shrill whistle was\r\nheard. Heidi stood still and the grandfather joined her outside. Down\r\nfrom the heights came one goat after another, with Peter in their\r\nmidst. Uttering a cry of joy, Heidi ran into the middle of the flock,\r\ngreeting her old friends. When they had all reached the hut, they\r\nstopped on their way and two beautiful slender goats came out of the\r\nherd, one of them white and the other brown. They came up to the\r\ngrandfather, who held out some salt in his hands to them, as he did\r\nevery night. Heidi tenderly caressed first one and then the other,\r\nseeming beside herself with joy.\r\n\r\n"Are they ours, grandfather? Do they both belong to us? Are they going\r\nto the stable? Are they going to stay with us?" Heidi kept on asking\r\nin her excitement. The grandfather hardly could put in a "yes, yes,\r\nsurely" between her numerous questions. When the goats had licked up\r\nall the salt, the old man said, "Go in, Heidi, and fetch your bowl\r\nand the bread."\r\n\r\nHeidi obeyed and returned instantly. The grandfather milked a full\r\nbowl from the white goat, cut a piece of bread for the child, and told\r\nher to eat. "Afterwards you can go to bed. If you need some shirts and\r\nother linen, you will find them in the bottom of the cupboard. Aunt\r\nDeta has left a bundle for you. Now good-night, I have to look after\r\nthe goats and lock them up for the night."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, grandfather! Oh, please tell me what their names are,"\r\ncalled Heidi after him.\r\n\r\n"The white one\'s name is Schwaenli and the brown one I call Baerli," was\r\nhis answer.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Schwaenli! Good-night, Baerli," the little girl called\r\nloudly, for they were just disappearing in the shed. Heidi now sat\r\ndown on the bench and took her supper. The strong wind nearly blew her\r\nfrom her seat, so she hurried with her meal, to be able to go inside\r\nand up to her bed. She slept in it as well as a prince on his royal\r\ncouch.\r\n\r\nVery soon after Heidi had gone up, before it was quite dark, the old\r\nman also sought his bed. He was always up in the morning with the sun,\r\nwhich rose early over the mountain-side in those summer days. It was a\r\nwild, stormy night; the hut was shaking in the gusts and all the\r\nboards were creaking. The wind howled through the chimney and the old\r\nfir-trees shook so strongly that many a dry branch came crashing down.\r\nIn the middle of the night the grandfather got up, saying to himself:\r\n"I am sure she is afraid." Climbing up the ladder, he went up to\r\nHeidi\'s bed. The first moment everything lay in darkness, when all of\r\na sudden the moon came out behind the clouds and sent his brilliant\r\nlight across Heidi\'s bed. Her cheeks were burning red and she lay\r\npeacefully on her round and chubby arms. She must have had a happy\r\ndream, for she was smiling in her sleep. The grandfather stood and\r\nwatched her till a cloud flew over the moon and left everything in\r\ntotal darkness. Then he went down to seek his bed again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nON THE PASTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nHeidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle. Opening her\r\neyes, she saw her little bed and the hay beside her bathed in golden\r\nsunlight. For a short while she did not know where she was, but when\r\nshe heard her grandfather\'s deep voice outside, she recollected\r\neverything. She remembered how she had come up the mountain the day\r\nbefore and left old Ursula, who was always shivering with cold and sat\r\nnear the stove all day. While Heidi lived with Ursula, she had always\r\nbeen obliged to keep in the house, where the old woman could see her.\r\nBeing deaf, Ursula was afraid to let Heidi go outdoors, and the child\r\nhad often fretted in the narrow room and had longed to run outside.\r\nShe was therefore delighted to find herself in her new home and hardly\r\ncould wait to see the goats again. Jumping out of bed, she put on her\r\nfew things and in a short time went down the ladder and ran outside.\r\nPeter was already there with his flock, waiting for Schwaenli and\r\nBaerli, whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to go with him to the pasture?" asked the grandfather.\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried Heidi, clapping her hands.\r\n\r\n"Go now, and wash yourself first, for the sun will laugh at you if he\r\nsees how dirty you are. Everything is ready there for you," he added,\r\npointing to a large tub of water that stood in the sun. Heidi did as\r\nshe was told, and washed and rubbed herself till her cheeks were\r\nglowing. In the meanwhile the grandfather called to Peter to come into\r\nthe hut and bring his bag along. The boy followed the old man, who\r\ncommanded him to open the bag in which he carried his scanty dinner.\r\nThe grandfather put into the bag a piece of bread and a slice of\r\ncheese, that were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the\r\nbag himself.\r\n\r\n"The little bowl goes in, too," said the Uncle, "for the child does\r\nnot know how to drink straight from the goat, the way you do. She is\r\ngoing to stay with you all day, therefore milk two bowls full for her\r\ndinner. Look out that she does not fall over the rocks! Do you hear?"\r\n\r\nJust then Heidi came running in. "Grandfather, can the sun still laugh\r\nat me?" she asked. The child had rubbed herself so violently with the\r\ncoarse towel which the grandfather had put beside the tub that her\r\nface, neck and arms were as red as a lobster. With a smile the\r\ngrandfather said: "No, he can\'t laugh any more now; but when you come\r\nhome to-night you must go into the tub like a fish. When one goes\r\nabout like the goats, one gets dirty feet. Be off!"\r\n\r\nThey started merrily up the Alp. A cloudless, deep-blue sky looked\r\ndown on them, for the wind had driven away every little cloud in the\r\nnight. The fresh green mountain-side was bathed in brilliant sunlight,\r\nand many blue and yellow flowers had opened. Heidi was wild with joy\r\nand ran from side to side. In one place she saw big patches of fine\r\nred primroses, on another spot blue gentians sparkled in the grass,\r\nand everywhere the golden rock-roses were nodding to her. In her\r\ntransport at finding such treasures, Heidi even forgot Peter and his\r\ngoats. She ran far ahead of him and then strayed away off to one side,\r\nfor the sparkling flowers tempted her here and there. Picking whole\r\nbunches of them to take home with her, she put them all into her\r\nlittle apron.\r\n\r\nPeter, whose round eyes could only move about slowly, had a hard time\r\nlooking out for her. The goats were even worse, and only by shouting\r\nand whistling, especially by swinging his rod, could he drive them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Heidi, where are you now?" he called quite angrily.\r\n\r\n"Here," it sounded from somewhere. Peter could not see her, for she\r\nwas sitting on the ground behind a little mound, which was covered\r\nwith fragrant flowers. The whole air was filled with their perfume,\r\nand the child drew it in, in long breaths.\r\n\r\n"Follow me now!" Peter called out. "The grandfather has told me to\r\nlook out for you, and you must not fall over the rocks."\r\n\r\n"Where are they?" asked Heidi without even stirring.\r\n\r\n"Way up there, and we have still far to go. If you come quickly, we\r\nmay see the eagle there and hear him shriek."\r\n\r\nThat tempted Heidi, and she came running to Peter, with her apron full\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\n"You have enough now," he declared. "If you pick them all to-day,\r\nthere won\'t be any left to-morrow." Heidi admitted that, besides which\r\nshe had her apron already full. From now on she stayed at Peter\'s\r\nside. The goats, scenting the pungent herbs, also hurried up without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nPeter generally took his quarters for the day at the foot of a high\r\ncliff, which seemed to reach far up into the sky. Overhanging rocks on\r\none side made it dangerous, so that the grandfather was wise to warn\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\nAfter they had reached their destination, the boy took off his bag,\r\nputting it in a little hollow in the ground. The wind often blew in\r\nviolent gusts up there, and Peter did not want to lose his precious\r\nload. Then he lay down in the sunny grass, for he was very tired.\r\n\r\nHeidi, taking off her apron, rolled it tightly together and put it\r\nbeside Peter\'s bag. Then, sitting down beside the boy, she looked\r\nabout her. Far down she saw the glistening valley; a large field of\r\nsnow rose high in front of her. Heidi sat a long time without\r\nstirring, with Peter asleep by her side and the goats climbing about\r\nbetween the bushes. A light breeze fanned her cheek and those big\r\nmountains about her made her feel happy as never before. She looked up\r\nat the mountain-tops till they all seemed to have faces, and soon they\r\nwere familiar to her, like old friends. Suddenly she heard a loud,\r\nsharp scream, and looking up she beheld the largest bird she had ever\r\nseen, flying above her. With outspread wings he flew in large circles\r\nover Heidi\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Wake up, Peter!" Heidi called. "Look up, Peter, and see the eagle\r\nthere!"\r\n\r\nPeter got wide wake, and then they both watched the bird breathlessly.\r\nIt rose higher and higher into the azure, till it disappeared at last\r\nbehind the mountain-peak.\r\n\r\n"Where has it gone?" Heidi asked.\r\n\r\n"Home to its nest," was Peter\'s answer.\r\n\r\n"Oh, does it really live way up there? How wonderful that must be! But\r\ntell me why it screams so loud?" Heidi inquired.\r\n\r\n"Because it has to," Peter replied.\r\n\r\n"Oh, let\'s climb up there and see its nest!" implored Heidi, but\r\nPeter, expressing decided disapproval in his voice, answered: "Oh\r\ndear, Oh dear, not even goats could climb up there! Grandfather has\r\ntold me not to let you fall down the rocks, so we can\'t go!"\r\n\r\nPeter now began to call loudly and to whistle, and soon all the goats\r\nwere assembled on the green field. Heidi ran into their midst, for she\r\nloved to see them leaping and playing about.\r\n\r\nPeter in the meantime was preparing dinner for Heidi and himself, by\r\nputting her large pieces on one side and his own small ones on the\r\nother. Then he milked Baerli and put the full bowl in the middle. When\r\nhe was ready, he called to the little girl. But it took some time\r\nbefore she obeyed his call.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: SHE HANDED HIM ALSO THE WHOLE SLICE OF CHEESE]\r\n\r\n"Stop jumping, now," said Peter, "and sit down; your dinner is ready."\r\n\r\n"Is this milk for me?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes it is; those large pieces also belong to you. When you are\r\nthrough with the milk, I\'ll get you some more. After that I\'ll get\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"What milk do you get?" Heidi inquired.\r\n\r\n"I get it from my own goat, that speckled one over there. But go ahead\r\nand eat!" Peter commanded again. Heidi obeyed, and when the bowl was\r\nempty, he filled it again. Breaking off a piece of bread for herself,\r\nshe gave Peter the rest, which was still bigger than his own portion\r\nhad been. She handed him also the whole slice of cheese, saying: "You\r\ncan eat that, I have had enough!"\r\n\r\nPeter was speechless with surprise, for it would have been impossible\r\nfor him ever to give up any of his share. Not taking Heidi in earnest,\r\nhe hesitated till she put the things on his knees. Then he saw she\r\nreally meant it, and he seized his prize. Nodding his thanks to her,\r\nhe ate the most luxurious meal he had ever had in all his life. Heidi\r\nwas watching the goats in the meantime, and asked Peter for their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe boy could tell them all to her, for their names were about the\r\nonly thing he had to carry in his head. She soon knew them, too, for\r\nshe had listened attentively. One of them was the Big Turk, who tried\r\nto stick his big horns into all the others. Most of the goats ran away\r\nfrom their rough comrade. The bold Thistlefinch alone was not afraid,\r\nand running his horns three or four times into the other, so\r\nastonished the Turk with his great daring that he stood still and gave\r\nup fighting, for the Thistlefinch had sharp horns and met him in the\r\nmost warlike attitude. A small, white goat, called Snowhopper, kept up\r\nbleating in the most piteous way, which induced Heidi to console it\r\nseveral times. Heidi at last went to the little thing again, and\r\nthrowing her arms around its head, she asked, "What is the matter with\r\nyou, Snowhopper? Why do you always cry for help?" The little goat\r\npressed close to Heidi\'s side and became perfectly quiet. Peter was\r\nstill eating, but between the swallows he called to Heidi: "She is so\r\nunhappy, because the old goat has left us. She was sold to somebody in\r\nMayenfeld two days ago."\r\n\r\n"Who was the old goat?"\r\n\r\n"Her mother, of course."\r\n\r\n"Where is her grandmother?"\r\n\r\n"She hasn\'t any."\r\n\r\n"And her grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t any either."\r\n\r\n"Poor little Snowhopper!" said Heidi, drawing the little creature\r\ntenderly to her. "Don\'t grieve any more; see, I am coming up with you\r\nevery day now, and if there is anything the matter, you can come to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nSnowhopper rubbed her head against Heidi\'s shoulder and stopped\r\nbleating. When Peter had finally finished his dinner, he joined Heidi.\r\n\r\nThe little girl had just been observing that Schwaenli and Baerli were\r\nby far the cleanest and prettiest of the goats. They evaded the\r\nobtrusive Turk with a sort of contempt and always managed to find the\r\ngreenest bushes for themselves. She mentioned it to Peter, who\r\nreplied: "I know! Of course they are the prettiest, because the uncle\r\nwashes them and gives them salt. He has the best stable by far."\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden Peter, who had been lying on the ground, jumped up and\r\nbounded after the goats. Heidi, knowing that something must have\r\nhappened, followed him. She saw him running to a dangerous abyss on\r\nthe side. Peter had noticed how the rash Thistlefinch had gone nearer\r\nand nearer to the dangerous spot. Peter only just came in time to\r\nprevent the goat from falling down over the very edge. Unfortunately\r\nPeter had stumbled over a stone in his hurry and was only able to\r\ncatch the goat by one leg. The Thistlefinch, being enraged to find\r\nhimself stopped in his charming ramble, bleated furiously. Not being\r\nable to get up, Peter loudly called for help. Heidi immediately saw\r\nthat Peter was nearly pulling off the animal\'s leg. She quickly picked\r\nsome fragrant herbs and holding them under the animal\'s nose, she said\r\nsoothingly: "Come, come, Thistlefinch, and be sensible. You might fall\r\ndown there and break your leg. That would hurt you horribly."\r\n\r\nThe goat turned about and devoured the herbs Heidi held in her hand.\r\nWhen Peter got to his feet, he led back the runaway with Heidi\'s help.\r\nWhen he had the goat in safety, he raised his rod to beat it for\r\npunishment. The goat retreated shyly, for it knew what was coming.\r\nHeidi screamed loudly: "Peter, no, do not beat him! look how scared he\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"He well deserves it," snarled Peter, ready to strike. But Heidi,\r\nseizing his arm, shouted, full of indignation: "You mustn\'t hurt him!\r\nLet him go!"\r\n\r\nHeidi\'s eyes were sparkling, and when he saw her with her commanding\r\nmien, he desisted and dropped his rope. "I\'ll let him go, if you give\r\nme a piece of your cheese again to-morrow," he said, for he wanted a\r\ncompensation for his fright.\r\n\r\n"You may have it all to-morrow and every day, because I don\'t need\r\nit," Heidi assured him. "I shall also give you a big piece of bread,\r\nif you promise never to beat any of the goats."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," growled Peter, and in that way he gave his promise.\r\n\r\nThus the day had passed, and the sun was already sinking down behind\r\nthe mountains. Sitting on the grass, Heidi looked at the bluebells and\r\nthe wild roses that were shining in the last rays of the sun. The\r\npeaks also started to glow, and Heidi suddenly called to the boy: "Oh,\r\nPeter, look! everything is on fire. The mountains are burning and the\r\nsky, too. Oh, look! the moon over there is on fire, too. Do you see\r\nthe mountains all in a glow? Oh, how beautiful the snow looks! Peter,\r\nthe eagle\'s nest is surely on fire, too. Oh, look at the fir-trees\r\nover there!"\r\n\r\nPeter was quietly peeling his rod, and looking up, said to Heidi:\r\n"This is no fire; it always looks like that."\r\n\r\n"But what is it then?" asked Heidi eagerly, gazing about her\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n"It gets that way of itself," explained Peter.\r\n\r\n"Oh look! Everything is all rosy now! Oh, look at this mountain over\r\nthere with the snow and the sharp peaks. What is its name?"\r\n\r\n"Mountains have no names," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, see, how beautiful! It looks as if many, many roses were growing\r\non those cliffs. Oh, now they are getting grey. Oh dear! the fire has\r\ngone out and it is all over. What a terrible shame!" said Heidi quite\r\ndespondently.\r\n\r\n"It will be the same again tomorrow," Peter reassured her. "Come now,\r\nwe have to go home."\r\n\r\nWhen Peter had called the goats together, they started downwards.\r\n\r\n"Will it be like that every day when we are up?" asked Heidi, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"It usually is," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"What about tomorrow?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow it will be like that, I am sure," Peter affirmed.\r\n\r\nThat made Heidi feel happy again. She walked quietly by Peter\'s side,\r\nthinking over all the new things she had seen. At last, reaching the\r\nhut, they found the grandfather waiting for them on a bench under the\r\nfir-trees. Heidi ran up to him and the two goats followed, for they\r\nknew their master. Peter called to her: "Come again tomorrow!\r\nGood-night!"\r\n\r\nHeidi gave him her hand, assuring him that she would come, and finding\r\nherself surrounded by the goats, she hugged Snowhopper a last time.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter had disappeared, Heidi returned to her grandfather. "Oh\r\ngrandfather! it was so beautiful! I saw the fire and the roses on the\r\nrocks! And see the many, many flowers I am bringing you!" With that\r\nHeidi shook them out of her apron. But oh, how miserable they looked!\r\nHeidi did not even know them any more.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with them, grandfather? They looked so different!"\r\nHeidi exclaimed in her fright.\r\n\r\n"They are made to bloom in the sun and not to be shut up in an apron,"\r\nsaid the grandfather.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall never pick them any more! Please, grandfather, tell me\r\nwhy the eagle screeches so loudly," asked Heidi.\r\n\r\n"First go and take a bath, while I go into the shed to get your milk.\r\nAfterwards we\'ll go inside together and I\'ll tell you all about it\r\nduring supper-time."\r\n\r\nThey did as was proposed, and when Heidi sat on her high chair before\r\nher milk, she asked the same question as before.\r\n\r\n"Because he is sneering at the people down below, who sit in the\r\nvillages and make each other angry. He calls down to them:--\'If you\r\nwould go apart to live up on the heights like me, you would feel much\r\nbetter!\'" The grandfather said these last words with such a wild\r\nvoice, that it reminded Heidi of the eagle\'s screech.\r\n\r\n"Why do the mountains have no names, grandfather?" asked Heidi.\r\n\r\n"They all have names, and if you tell me their shape I can name them\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\nHeidi described several and the old man could name them all. The child\r\ntold him now about all the happenings of the day, and especially about\r\nthe wonderful fire. She asked how it came about.\r\n\r\n"The sun does it," he exclaimed. "Saying good-night to the mountains,\r\nhe throws his most beautiful rays to them, that they may not forget\r\nhim till the morning."\r\n\r\nHeidi was so much pleased with this explanation, that she could hardly\r\nwait to see the sun\'s good-night greetings repeated. It was time now\r\nto go to bed, and Heidi slept soundly all night. She dreamt that the\r\nlittle Snowhopper was bounding happily about on the glowing mountains\r\nwith many glistening roses blooming round her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIN THE GRANDMOTHER\'S HUT\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning Peter came again with his goats, and Heidi went up to the\r\npasture with them. This happened day after day, and in this healthy\r\nlife Heidi grew stronger, and more sunburnt every day. Soon the autumn\r\ncame and when the wind was blowing across the mountainside, the\r\ngrandfather would say: "You must stay home to-day, Heidi; for the wind\r\ncan blow such a little thing as you down into the valley with a single\r\ngust."\r\n\r\nIt always made Peter unhappy when Heidi did not come along, for he saw\r\nnothing but misfortunes ahead of him; he hardly knew how to pass his\r\ntime, and besides, he was deprived of his abundant dinner. The goats\r\nwere so accustomed to Heidi by this time, that they did not follow\r\nPeter when she was not with him.\r\n\r\nHeidi herself did not mind staying at home, for she loved nothing\r\nbetter than to watch her grandfather with his saw and hammer.\r\nSometimes the grandfather would make small round cheeses on those\r\ndays, and there was no greater pleasure for Heidi than to see him stir\r\nthe butter with his bare arms. When the wind would howl through the\r\nfir-trees on those stormy days, Heidi would run out to the grove,\r\nthrilled and happy by the wondrous roaring in the branches. The sun\r\nhad lost its vigor, and the child had to put on her shoes and\r\nstockings and her little dress.\r\n\r\nThe weather got colder and colder, and when Peter came up in the\r\nmorning, he would blow into his hands, he was so frozen. At last even\r\nPeter could not come any more, for a deep snow had fallen over night.\r\nHeidi stood at the window, watching the snow falling down. It kept on\r\nsnowing till it reached the windows; still it did not stop, and soon\r\nthe windows could not be opened, and they were all shut in. When it\r\nhad lasted for several days, Heidi thought that it would soon cover\r\nup the cottage. It finally stopped, and the grandfather went out to\r\nshovel the snow away from the door and windows, piling it up high here\r\nand there. In the afternoon the two were sitting near the fire when\r\nnoisy steps were heard outside and the door was pushed open. It was\r\nPeter, who had come up to see Heidi. Muttering, "Good-evening," he\r\nwent up to the fire. His face was beaming, and Heidi had to laugh when\r\nshe saw little waterfalls trickling down from his person, for all the\r\nice and snow had melted in the great heat.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather now asked Peter how he got along in school. Heidi was\r\nso interested that she asked him a hundred questions. Poor Peter, who\r\nwas not an easy talker, found himself in great difficulty answering\r\nthe little girl\'s inquiries, but at least it gave him leisure to dry\r\nhis clothes.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation the grandfather\'s eyes had been twinkling,\r\nand at last he said to the boy: "Now that you have been under fire,\r\ngeneral, you need some strengthening. Come and join us at supper."\r\n\r\nWith that the old man prepared a meal which amply satisfied Peter\'s\r\nappetite. It had begun to get dark, and Peter knew that it was time to\r\ngo. He had said good-bye and thank you, when turning to Heidi he\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come next Sunday, if I may. By the way, Heidi, grandmother asked\r\nme to tell you that she would love to see you."\r\n\r\nHeidi immediately approved of this idea, and her first word next\r\nmorning was: "Grandfather, I must go down to grandmother. She is\r\nexpecting me."\r\n\r\nFour days later the sun was shining and the tight-packed frozen snow\r\nwas crackling under every step. Heidi was sitting at the dinner-table,\r\nimploring the old man to let her make the visit then, when he got up,\r\nand fetching down her heavy cover, told her to follow him. They went\r\nout into the glistening snow; no sound was heard and the snow-laden\r\nfir-trees shone and glittered in the sun. Heidi in her transport was\r\nrunning to and fro: "Grandfather, come out! Oh, look at the trees!\r\nThey are all covered with silver and gold," she called to the\r\ngrandfather, who had just come out of his workshop with a wide sled.\r\nWrapping the child up in her cover, he put her on the sled, holding\r\nher fast. Off they started at such a pace that Heidi shouted for joy,\r\nfor she seemed to be flying like a bird. The sled had stopped in front\r\nof Peter\'s hut, and grandfather said: "Go in. When it gets dark, start\r\non your way home." When he had unwrapped her, he turned homewards with\r\nhis sled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFF THEY STARTED AT SUCH A PACE THAT HEIDI SHOUTED FOR\r\nJOY]\r\n\r\nOpening the door, Heidi found herself in a tiny, dark kitchen, and\r\ngoing through another door, she entered a narrow chamber. Near a table\r\na woman was seated, busy with mending Peter\'s coat, which Heidi had\r\nrecognized immediately. A bent old woman was sitting in a corner, and\r\nHeidi, approaching her at once, said: "How do you do, grandmother? I\r\nhave come now, and I hope I haven\'t kept you waiting too long!"\r\n\r\nLifting her head, the grandmother sought for Heidi\'s hand. Feeling it\r\nthoughtfully, she said: "Are you the little girl who lives up with the\r\nuncle? Is your name Heidi?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Heidi replied. "The grandfather just brought me down in the\r\nsled."\r\n\r\n"How is it possible? Your hands are as warm as toast! Brigida, did the\r\nuncle really come down with the child?"\r\n\r\nBrigida, Peter\'s mother, had gotten up to look at the child. She said:\r\n"I don\'t know if he did, but I don\'t think so. She probably doesn\'t\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nHeidi, looking up, said quite decidedly: "I know that grandfather\r\nwrapped me up in a cover when we coasted down together."\r\n\r\n"Peter was right after all," said the grandmother. "We never thought\r\nthe child would live more than three weeks with him. Brigida, tell me\r\nwhat she looks like."\r\n\r\n"She has Adelheid\'s fine limbs and black eyes, and curly hair like\r\nTobias and the old man. I think she looks like both of them."\r\n\r\nWhile the women were talking, Heidi had been taking in everything.\r\nThen she said: "Grandmother, look at the shutter over there. It is\r\nhanging loose. If grandfather were here, he would fasten it. It will\r\nbreak the window-pane! Just look at it."\r\n\r\n"What a sweet child you are," said the grandmother tenderly. "I can\r\nhear it, but I cannot see it, child. This cottage rattles and creaks,\r\nand when the wind blows, it comes in through every chink. Some day the\r\nwhole house will break to pieces and fall on top of us. If only Peter\r\nknew how to mend it! We have no one else."\r\n\r\n"Why, grandmother, can\'t you see the shutter?" asked Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Child, I cannot see anything," lamented the old woman.\r\n\r\n"Can you see it when I open the shutter to let in the light?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, not even then. Nobody can ever show me the light again."\r\n\r\n"But you can see when you go out into the snow, where everything is\r\nbright. Come with me, grandmother, I\'ll show you!" and Heidi, taking\r\nthe old woman by the hand, tried to lead her out. Heidi was frightened\r\nand got more anxious all the time.\r\n\r\n"Just let me stay here, child. Everything is dark for me, and my poor\r\neyes can neither see the snow nor the light."\r\n\r\n"But grandmother, does it not get light in the summer, when the sun\r\nshines down on the mountains to say good-night, setting them all\r\naflame?"\r\n\r\n"No, child, I can never see the fiery mountains any more. I have to\r\nlive in darkness, always."\r\n\r\nHeidi burst out crying now and sobbed aloud. "Can nobody make it light\r\nfor you? Is there nobody who can do it, grandmother? Nobody?"\r\n\r\nThe grandmother tried all possible means to comfort the child; it\r\nwrung her heart to see her terrible distress. It was awfully hard for\r\nHeidi to stop crying when she had once begun, for she cried so seldom.\r\nThe grandmother said: "Heidi, let me tell you something. People who\r\ncannot see love to listen to friendly words. Sit down beside me and\r\ntell me all about yourself. Talk to me about your grandfather, for it\r\nhas been long since I have heard anything about him. I used to know\r\nhim very well."\r\n\r\nHeidi suddenly wiped away her tears, for she had had a cheering\r\nthought. "Grandmother, I shall tell grandfather about it, and I am\r\nsure he can make it light for you. He can mend your little house and\r\nstop the rattling."\r\n\r\nThe old woman remained silent, and Heidi, with the greatest vivacity,\r\nbegan to describe her life with the grandfather. Listening\r\nattentively, the two women would say to each other sometimes: "Do you\r\nhear what she says about the uncle? Did you listen?"\r\n\r\nHeidi\'s tale was interrupted suddenly by a great thumping on the door;\r\nand who should come in but Peter. No sooner had he seen Heidi, than he\r\nsmiled, opening his round eyes as wide as possible. Heidi called,\r\n"Good-evening, Peter!"\r\n\r\n"Is it really time for him to come home!" exclaimed Peter\'s\r\ngrandmother. "How quickly the time has flown. Good-evening, little\r\nPeter; how is your reading going?"\r\n\r\n"Just the same," the boy replied.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, I was hoping for a change at last. You are nearly twelve\r\nyears old, my boy."\r\n\r\n"Why should there be a change?" inquired Heidi with greatest interest.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he\'ll never learn it after all. On the shelf over there\r\nis an old prayer-book with beautiful songs. I have forgotten them all,\r\nfor I do not hear them any more. I longed that Peter should read them\r\nto me some day, but he will never be able to!"\r\n\r\nPeter\'s mother got up from her work now, saying, "I must make a light.\r\nThe afternoon has passed and now it\'s getting dark."\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi heard those words, she started, and holding out her hand to\r\nall, she said: "Good-night. I have to go, for it is getting dark." But\r\nthe anxious grandmother called out: "Wait, child, don\'t go up alone!\r\nGo with her, Peter, and take care that she does not fall. Don\'t let\r\nher get cold, do you hear? Has Heidi a shawl?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t, but I won\'t be cold," Heidi called back, for she had\r\nalready escaped through the door. She ran so fast that Peter could\r\nhardly follow her. The old woman frettingly called out: "Brigida, run\r\nafter her. Get a warm shawl, she\'ll freeze in this cold night. Hurry\r\nup!" Brigida obeyed. The children had hardly climbed any distance,\r\nwhen they saw the old man coming and with a few vigorous steps he\r\nstood beside them.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you kept your word, Heidi," he said; and packing her into\r\nher cover, he started up the hill, carrying the child in his arms.\r\nBrigida had come in time to see it, and told the grandmother what she\r\nhad witnessed.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, thank God!" the old woman said. "I hope she\'ll come again;\r\nshe has done me so much good! What a soft heart she has, the darling,\r\nand how nicely she can talk." All evening the grandmother said to\r\nherself, "If only he lets her come again! I have something to look\r\nforward to in this world now, thank God!"\r\n\r\nHeidi could hardly wait before they reached the cottage. She had tried\r\nto talk on the way, but no sound could be heard through the heavy\r\ncover. As soon as they were inside the hut she began: "Grandfather, we\r\nmust take some nails and a hammer down tomorrow; a shutter is loose in\r\ngrandmother\'s house and many other places shake. Everything rattles in\r\nher house."\r\n\r\n"Is that so? Who says we must?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody told me, but I know," Heidi replied. "Everything is loose in\r\nthe house, and poor grandmother told me she was afraid that the house\r\nmight tumble down. And grandfather, she cannot see the light. Can you\r\nhelp her and make it light for her? How terrible it must be to be\r\nafraid in the dark and nobody there to help you! Oh, please,\r\ngrandfather, do something to help her! I know you can."\r\n\r\nHeidi had been clinging to her grandfather and looking up to him with\r\ntrusting eyes. At last he said, glancing down: "All right, child,\r\nwe\'ll see that it won\'t rattle any more. We can do it tomorrow."\r\n\r\nHeidi was so overjoyed at these words that she danced around the room\r\nshouting: "We\'ll do it tomorrow! We can do it tomorrow!"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather, keeping his word, took Heidi down the following day\r\nwith the same instructions as before. After Heidi had disappeared, he\r\nwent around the house inspecting it.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother, in her joy at seeing the child again, had stopped the\r\nwheel and called: "Here is the child again! She has come again!"\r\nHeidi, grasping her outstretched hands, sat herself on a low stool at\r\nthe old woman\'s feet and began to chat. Suddenly violent blows were\r\nheard outside; the grandmother in her fright nearly upset the\r\nspinning-wheel and screamed: "Oh, God, it has come at last. The hut is\r\ntumbling down!"\r\n\r\n"Grandmother, don\'t be frightened," said the child, while she put her\r\narms around her. "Grandfather is just fastening the shutter and fixing\r\neverything for you."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible? Has God not forgotten us after all? Brigida, have you\r\nheard it? Surely that is a hammer. Ask him to come in a moment, if it\r\nis he, for I must thank him."\r\n\r\nWhen Brigida went out, she found the old man busy with putting a new\r\nbeam along the wall. Approaching him, she said: "Mother and I wish you\r\na good-afternoon. We are very much obliged to you for doing us such a\r\nservice, and mother would like to see you. There are few that would\r\nhave done it, uncle, and how can we thank you?"\r\n\r\n"That will do," he interrupted. "I know what your opinion about me is.\r\nGo in, for I can find what needs mending myself."\r\n\r\nBrigida obeyed, for the uncle had a way that nobody could oppose. All\r\nafternoon the uncle hammered around; he even climbed up on the roof,\r\nwhere much was missing. At last he had to stop, for the last nail was\r\ngone from his pocket. The darkness had come in the meantime, and\r\nHeidi was ready to go up with him, packed warmly in his arms.\r\n\r\nThus the winter passed. Sunshine had come again into the blind woman\'s\r\nlife, and made her days less dark and dreary. Early every morning she\r\nwould begin to listen for Heidi\'s footsteps, and when the door was\r\nopened and the child ran in, the grandmother exclaimed every time more\r\njoyfully: "Thank God, she has come again!"\r\n\r\nHeidi would talk about her life, and make the grandmother smile and\r\nlaugh, and in that way the hours flew by. In former times the old\r\nwoman had always sighed: "Brigida, is the day not over yet?" but now\r\nshe always exclaimed after Heidi\'s departure: "How quickly the\r\nafternoon has gone by. Don\'t you think so, too, Brigida?" Her daughter\r\nhad to assent, for Heidi had long ago won her heart. "If only God will\r\nspare us the child!" the grandmother would often say. "I hope the\r\nuncle will always be kind, as he is now."--"Does Heidi look well,\r\nBrigida?" was a frequent question, which always got a reassuring\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nHeidi also became very fond of the old grandmother, and when the\r\nweather was fair, she visited her every day that winter. Whenever the\r\nchild remembered that the grandmother was blind, she would get very\r\nsad; her only comfort was that her coming brought such happiness. The\r\ngrandfather soon had mended the cottage; often he would take down big\r\nloads of timber, which he used to good purpose. The grandmother vowed\r\nthat no rattling could be heard any more, and that, thanks to the\r\nuncle\'s kindness, she slept better that winter than she had done for\r\nmany a year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTWO VISITORS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo winters had nearly passed. Heidi was happy, for the spring was\r\ncoming again, with the soft delicious wind that made the fir-trees\r\nroar. Soon she would be able to go up to the pasture, where blue and\r\nyellow flowers greeted her at every step. She was nearly eight years\r\nold, and had learned to take care of the goats, who ran after her like\r\nlittle dogs. Several times the village teacher had sent word by Peter\r\nthat the child was wanted in school, but the old man had not paid any\r\nattention to the message and had kept her with him as before. It was a\r\nbeautiful morning in March. The snow had melted on the slopes, and was\r\ngoing fast. Snowdrops were peeping through the ground, which seemed to\r\nbe getting ready for spring. Heidi was running to and fro before the\r\ndoor, when she suddenly saw an old gentleman, dressed in black,\r\nstanding beside her. As she appeared frightened, he said kindly: "You\r\nmust not be afraid of me, for I love children. Give me your hand,\r\nHeidi, and tell me where your grandfather is."\r\n\r\n"He is inside, making round wooden spoons," the child replied, opening\r\nthe door while she spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was the old pastor of the village, who had known the grandfather\r\nyears ago. After entering, he approached the old man, saying:\r\n"Good-morning, neighbor."\r\n\r\nThe old man got up, surprised, and offering a seat to the visitor,\r\nsaid: "Good-morning, Mr. Parson. Here is a wooden chair, if it is good\r\nenough."\r\n\r\nSitting down, the parson said: "It is long since I have seen you,\r\nneighbor. I have come to-day to talk over a matter with you. I am sure\r\nyou can guess what it is about."\r\n\r\nThe clergyman here looked at Heidi, who was standing near the door.\r\n\r\n"Heidi, run out to see the goats," said the grandfather, "and bring\r\nthem some salt; you can stay till I come."\r\n\r\nHeidi disappeared on the spot. "The child should have come to school a\r\nyear ago," the parson went on to say. "Didn\'t you get the teacher\'s\r\nwarning? What do you intend to do with the child?"\r\n\r\n"I do not want her to go to school," said the old man, unrelentingly.\r\n\r\n"What do you want the child to be?"\r\n\r\n"I want her to be free and happy as a bird!"\r\n\r\n"But she is human, and it is high time for her to learn something. I\r\nhave come now to tell you about it, so that you can make your plans.\r\nShe must come to school next winter; remember that."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t do it, pastor!" was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Do you think there is no way?" the clergyman replied, a little hotly.\r\n"You know the world, for you have travelled far. What little sense you\r\nshow!"\r\n\r\n"You think I am going to send this delicate child to school in every\r\nstorm and weather!" the old man said excitedly. "It is a two hours\'\r\nwalk, and I shall not let her go; for the wind often howls so that it\r\nchokes me if I venture out. Did you know Adelheid, her mother? She was\r\na sleep-walker, and had fainting-fits. Nobody shall compel me to let\r\nher go; I will gladly fight it out in court."\r\n\r\n"You are perfectly right," said the clergyman kindly. "You could not\r\nsend her to school from here. Why don\'t you come down to live among us\r\nagain? You are leading a strange life here; I wonder how you can keep\r\nthe child warm in winter."\r\n\r\n"She has young blood and a good cover. I know where to find good wood,\r\nand all winter I keep a fire going. I couldn\'t live in the village,\r\nfor the people there and I despise each other; we had better keep\r\napart."\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken, I assure you! Make your peace with God, and then\r\nyou\'ll see how happy you will be."\r\n\r\nThe clergyman had risen, and holding out his hand, he said cordially:\r\n"I shall count on you next winter, neighbor. We shall receive you\r\ngladly, reconciled with God and man."\r\n\r\nBut the uncle replied firmly, while he shook his visitor by the hand:\r\n"Thank you for your kindness, but you will have to wait in vain."\r\n\r\n"God be with you," said the parson, and left him sadly.\r\n\r\nThe old man was out of humor that day, and when Heidi begged to go to\r\nthe grandmother, he only growled: "Not to-day." Next day they had\r\nhardly finished their dinner, when another visitor arrived. It was\r\nHeidi\'s aunt Deta; she wore a hat with feathers and a dress with such\r\na train that it swept up everything that lay on the cottage floor.\r\nWhile the uncle looked at her silently, Deta began to praise him and\r\nthe child\'s red cheeks. She told him that it had not been her\r\nintention to leave Heidi with him long, for she knew she must be in\r\nhis way. She had tried to provide for the child elsewhere, and at\r\nlast she had found a splendid chance for her. Very rich relations of\r\nher lady, who owned the largest house in Frankfurt, had a lame\r\ndaughter. This poor little girl was confined to her rolling-chair and\r\nneeded a companion at her lessons. Deta had heard from her lady that a\r\nsweet, quaint child was wanted as playmate and schoolmate for the\r\ninvalid. She had gone to the housekeeper and told her all about Heidi.\r\nThe lady, delighted with the idea, had told her to fetch the child at\r\nonce. She had come now, and it was a lucky chance for Heidi, "for one\r\nnever knew what might happen in such a case, and who could tell--"\r\n\r\n"Have you finished?" the old man interrupted her at last.\r\n\r\n"Why, one might think I was telling you the silliest things. There is\r\nnot a man in Praetiggan who would not thank God for such news."\r\n\r\n"Bring them to somebody else, but not to me," said the uncle, coldly.\r\n\r\nDeta, flaming up, replied: "Do you want to hear what I think? Don\'t I\r\nknow how old she is; eight years old and ignorant of everything. They\r\nhave told me that you refuse to send her to church and to school. She\r\nis my only sister\'s child, and I shall not bear it, for I am\r\nresponsible. You do not care for her, how else could you be\r\nindifferent to such luck. You had better give way or I shall get the\r\npeople to back me. If I were you, I would not have it brought to\r\ncourt; some things might be warmed up that you would not care to hear\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"Be quiet!" the uncle thundered with flaming eyes. "Take her and ruin\r\nher, but do not bring her before my sight again. I do not want to see\r\nher with feathers in her hat and wicked words like yours."\r\n\r\nWith long strides he went out.\r\n\r\n"You have made him angry!" said Heidi with a furious look.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t be cross long. But come now, where are your things?" asked\r\nDeta.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t come," Heidi replied.\r\n\r\n"What?" Deta said passionately. But changing her tone, she continued\r\nin a more friendly manner: "Come now; you don\'t understand me. I am\r\ntaking you to the most beautiful place you have ever seen." After\r\npacking up Heidi\'s clothes she said again, "Come, child, and take your\r\nhat. It is not very nice, but we can\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"I shall not come," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be stupid and obstinate, like a goat. Listen to me. Grandfather\r\nis sending us away and we must do what he commands, or he will get\r\nmore angry still. You\'ll see how fine it is in Frankfurt. If you do\r\nnot like it, you can come home again and by that time grandfather will\r\nhave forgiven us."\r\n\r\n"Can I come home again to-night?" asked Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Come now, I told you you could come back. If we get to Mayenfeld\r\ntoday, we can take the train to-morrow. That will make you fly home\r\nagain in the shortest time!"\r\n\r\nHolding the bundle, Deta led the child down the mountain. On their\r\nway they met Peter, who had not gone to school that day. The boy\r\nthought it was a more useful occupation to look for hazel-rods than to\r\nlearn to read, for he always needed the rods. He had had a most\r\nsuccessful day, for he carried an enormous bundle on his shoulder.\r\nWhen he caught sight of Heidi and Deta, he asked them where they were\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Frankfurt with Aunt Deta," Heidi replied; "but first I\r\nmust see grandmother, for she is waiting."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it is too late. You can see her when you come back, but not\r\nnow," said Deta, pulling Heidi along with her, for she was afraid that\r\nthe old woman might detain the child.\r\n\r\nPeter ran into the cottage and hit the table with his rods. The\r\ngrandmother jumped up in her fright and asked him what that meant.\r\n\r\n"They have taken Heidi away," Peter said with a groan.\r\n\r\n"Who has, Peter? Where has she gone?" the unhappy grandmother asked.\r\nBrigida had seen Deta walking up the footpath a short while ago and\r\nsoon they guessed what had happened. With a trembling hand the old\r\nwoman opened a window and called out as loudly as she could: "Deta,\r\nDeta, don\'t take the child away. Don\'t take her from us."\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi heard that she struggled to get free, and said: "I must go\r\nto grandmother; she is calling me."\r\n\r\nBut Deta would not let her go. She urged her on by saying that she\r\nmight return soon again. She also suggested that Heidi might bring a\r\nlovely present to the grandmother when she came back.\r\n\r\nHeidi liked this prospect and followed Deta without more ado. After a\r\nwhile she asked: "What shall I bring to the grandmother?"\r\n\r\n"You might bring her some soft white rolls, Heidi. I think the black\r\nbread is too hard for poor grandmother to eat."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know, aunt, she always gives it to Peter," Heidi confirmed\r\nher. "We must go quickly now; we might get to Frankfurt today and\r\nthen I can be back tomorrow with the rolls."\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: WHEN HEIDI HEARD THAT SHE STRUGGLED TO GET FREE]\r\n\r\nHeidi was running now, and Deta had to follow. She was glad enough to\r\nescape the questions that people might ask her in the village. People\r\ncould see that Heidi was pulling her along, so she said: "I can\'t\r\nstop. Don\'t you see how the child is hurrying? We have still far to\r\ngo," whenever she heard from all sides: "Are you taking her with you?"\r\n"Is she running away from the uncle?" "What a wonder she is still\r\nalive!" "What red cheeks she has," and so on. Soon they had escaped\r\nand had left the village far behind them.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on the uncle looked more angry than ever when he came\r\nto the village. Everybody was afraid of him, and the women would warn\r\ntheir children to keep out of his sight.\r\n\r\nHe came down but seldom, and then only to sell his cheese and buy his\r\nprovisions. Often people remarked how lucky it was that Heidi had left\r\nhim. They had seen her hurrying away, so they thought that she had\r\nbeen glad to go.\r\n\r\nThe old grandmother alone stuck to him faithfully. Whenever anybody\r\ncame up to her, she would tell them what good care the old man had\r\ntaken of Heidi. She also told them that he had mended her little\r\nhouse. These reports reached the village, of course, but people only\r\nhalf believed them, for the grandmother was infirm and old. She began\r\nher days with sighing again. "All happiness has left us with the\r\nchild. The days are so long and dreary, and I have no joy left. If\r\nonly I could hear Heidi\'s voice before I die," the poor old woman\r\nwould exclaim, day after day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nA NEW CHAPTER WITH NEW THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a beautiful house in Frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of\r\nClara Sesemann. She was sitting in a comfortable rolling-chair, which\r\ncould be pushed from room to room. Clara spent most of her time in the\r\nstudy, where long rows of bookcases lined the walls. This room was\r\nused as a living-room, and here she was also given her lessons.\r\n\r\nClara had a pale, thin face with soft blue eyes, which at that moment\r\nwere watching the clock impatiently. At last she said: "Oh Miss\r\nRottenmeier, isn\'t it time yet?"\r\n\r\nThe lady so addressed was the housekeeper, who had lived with Clara\r\nsince Mrs. Sesemann\'s death. Miss Rottenmeier wore a peculiar uniform\r\nwith a long cape, and a high cap on her head. Clara\'s father, who was\r\naway from home a great deal, left the entire management of the house\r\nto this lady, on the condition that his daughter\'s wishes should\r\nalways be considered.\r\n\r\nWhile Clara was waiting, Deta had arrived at the front door with\r\nHeidi. She was asking the coachman who had brought her if she could go\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not my business," grumbled the coachman; "you must ring for\r\nthe butler."\r\n\r\nSebastian, the butler, a man with large brass buttons on his coat,\r\nsoon stood before her.\r\n\r\n"May I see Miss Rottenmeier?" Deta asked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not my business," the butler announced. "Ring for Tinette, the\r\nmaid." With that, he disappeared.\r\n\r\nDeta, ringing again, saw a girl with a brilliant white cap on her\r\nhead, coming down the stairway. The maid stopped half-way down and\r\nasked scornfully: "What do you want?"\r\n\r\nDeta repeated her wish again. Tinette told her to wait while she went\r\nupstairs, but it did not take long before the two were asked to come\r\nup.\r\n\r\nFollowing the maid, they found themselves in the study. Deta held on\r\nto Heidi\'s hand and stayed near the door.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottenmeier, slowly getting up, approached the newcomers. She did\r\nnot seem pleased with Heidi, who wore her hat and shawl and was\r\nlooking up at the lady\'s headdress with innocent wonder.\r\n\r\n"What is your name?" the lady asked.\r\n\r\n"Heidi," was the child\'s clear answer.\r\n\r\n"What? Is that a Christian name? What name did you receive in\r\nbaptism?" inquired the lady again.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember that any more," the child replied.\r\n\r\n"What an answer! What does that mean?" said the housekeeper, shaking\r\nher head. "Is the child ignorant or pert, Miss Deta?"\r\n\r\n"I shall speak for the child, if I may, madam," Deta said, after\r\ngiving Heidi a little blow for her unbecoming answer. "The child has\r\nnever been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave. I\r\nhope the lady will forgive her manners. She is called Adelheid after\r\nher mother, who was my sister."\r\n\r\n"Oh well, that is better. But Miss Deta, the child seems peculiar for\r\nher age. I thought I told you that Miss Clara\'s companion would have\r\nto be twelve years old like her, to be able to share her studies. How\r\nold is Adelheid?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, but I am afraid she is somewhat younger than I thought. I\r\nthink she is about ten years old."\r\n\r\n"Grandfather said that I was eight years old," said Heidi now. Deta\r\ngave her another blow, but as the child had no idea why, she did not\r\nget embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"What, only eight years old!" Miss Rottenmeier exclaimed indignantly.\r\n"How can we get along? What have you learned? What books have you\r\nstudied?"\r\n\r\n"None," said Heidi.\r\n\r\n"But how did you learn to read?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t read and Peter can\'t do it either," Heidi retorted.\r\n\r\n"For mercy\'s sake! you cannot read?" cried the lady in her surprise.\r\n"How is it possible? What else have you studied?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," replied Heidi, truthfully.\r\n\r\n"Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?" said the housekeeper,\r\nwhen she was more composed.\r\n\r\nDeta, however, was not easily intimidated, and said: "I am sorry, but\r\nI thought this child would suit you. She _is_ small, but older\r\nchildren are often spoilt and not like her. I must go now, for my\r\nmistress is waiting. As soon as I can, I\'ll come to see how the child\r\nis getting along." With a bow she was outside and with a few quick\r\nsteps hurried down-stairs.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back, for she\r\nwanted to ask Deta a number of questions.\r\n\r\nHeidi was still standing on the same spot. Clara had watched the\r\nscene, and called to the child now to come to her.\r\n\r\nHeidi approached the rolling-chair.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to be called Heidi or Adelheid?" asked Clara.\r\n\r\n"My name is Heidi and nothing else," was the child\'s answer.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll call you Heidi then, for I like it very much," said Clara. "I\r\nhave never heard the name before. What curly hair you have! Was it\r\nalways like that?"\r\n\r\n"I think so."\r\n\r\n"Did you like to come to Frankfurt?" asked Clara again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, but then I am going home again to-morrow, and shall bring\r\ngrandmother some soft white rolls," Heidi explained.\r\n\r\n"What a curious child you are," said Clara. "You have come to\r\nFrankfurt to stay with me, don\'t you know that? We shall have our\r\nlessons together, and I think it will be great fun when you learn to\r\nread. Generally the morning seems to have no end, for Mr. Candidate\r\ncomes at ten and stays till two. That is a long time, and he has to\r\nyawn himself, he gets so tired. Miss Rottenmeier and he both yawn\r\ntogether behind their books, but when I do it, Miss Rottenmeier makes\r\nme take cod-liver oil and says that I am ill. So I must swallow my\r\nyawns, for I hate the oil. What fun it will be now, when you learn to\r\nread!"\r\n\r\nHeidi shook her head doubtfully at these prospects.\r\n\r\n"Everybody must learn to read, Heidi. Mr. Candidate is very patient\r\nand will explain it all to you. You won\'t know what he means at first,\r\nfor it is difficult to understand him. It won\'t take long to learn,\r\nthough, and then you will know what he means."\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rottenmeier found that she was unable to recall Deta, she\r\ncame back to the children. She was in a very excited mood, for she\r\nfelt responsible for Heidi\'s coming and did not know how to cancel\r\nthis unfortunate step. She soon got up again to go to the dining-room,\r\ncriticising the butler and giving orders to the maid. Sebastian, not\r\ndaring to show his rage otherwise, noisily opened the folding doors.\r\nWhen he went up to Clara\'s chair, he saw Heidi watching him intently.\r\nAt last she said: "You look like Peter."\r\n\r\nMiss Rottenmeier was horrified with this remark, and sent them all\r\ninto the dining-room. After Clara was lifted on to her chair, the\r\nhousekeeper sat down beside her. Heidi was motioned to sit opposite\r\nthe lady. In that way they were placed at the enormous table. When\r\nHeidi saw a roll on her plate, she turned to Sebastian, and pointing\r\nat it, asked, "Can I have this?" Heidi had already great confidence in\r\nthe butler, especially on account of the resemblance she had\r\ndiscovered. The butler nodded, and when he saw Heidi put the bread in\r\nher pocket, could hardly keep from laughing. He came to Heidi now with\r\na dish of small baked fishes. For a long time the child did not move;\r\nthen turning her eyes to the butler, she said: "Must I eat that?"\r\nSebastian nodded, but another pause ensued. "Why don\'t you give it to\r\nme?" the child quietly asked, looking at her plate. The butler, hardly\r\nable to keep his countenance, was told to place the dish on the table\r\nand leave the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Miss Rottenmeier explained to Heidi with many signs\r\nhow to help herself at table. She also told her never to speak to\r\nSebastian unless it was important. After that the child was told how\r\nto accost the servants and the governess. When the question came up of\r\nhow to call Clara, the older girl said, "Of course you shall call me\r\nClara."\r\n\r\nA great many rules followed now about behavior at all times, about the\r\nshutting of doors and about going to bed, and a hundred other things.\r\nPoor Heidi\'s eyes were closing, for she had risen at five that\r\nmorning, and leaning against her chair she fell asleep. When Miss\r\nRottenmeier had finished instructions, she said: "I hope you will\r\nremember everything, Adelheid. Did you understand me?"\r\n\r\n"Heidi went to sleep a long time ago," said Clara, highly amused.\r\n\r\n"It is atrocious what I have to bear with this child," exclaimed Miss\r\nRottenmeier, ringing the bell with all her might. When the two\r\nservants arrived, they were hardly able to rouse Heidi enough to show\r\nher to her bed-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMISS ROTTENMEIER HAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi opened her eyes next morning, she did not know where she\r\nwas. She found herself on a high white bed in a spacious room. Looking\r\naround she observed long white curtains before the windows, several\r\nchairs, and a sofa covered with cretonne; in a corner she saw a\r\nwash-stand with many curious things standing on it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Heidi remembered all the happenings of the previous day.\r\nJumping out of bed, she dressed in a great hurry. She was eager to\r\nlook at the sky and the ground below, as she had always done at home.\r\nWhat was her disappointment when she found that the windows were too\r\nhigh for her to see anything except the walls and windows opposite.\r\nTrying to open them, she turned from one to the other, but in vain.\r\nThe poor child felt like a little bird that is placed in a glittering\r\ncage for the first time. At last she had to resign herself, and sat\r\ndown on a low stool, thinking of the melting snow on the slopes and\r\nthe first flowers of spring that she had hailed with such delight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tinette opened the door and said curtly: "Breakfast\'s ready."\r\n\r\nHeidi did not take this for a summons, for the maid\'s face was\r\nscornful and forbidding. She was waiting patiently for what would\r\nhappen next, when Miss Rottenmeier burst into the room, saying: "What\r\nis the matter, Adelheid? Didn\'t you understand? Come to breakfast!"\r\n\r\nHeidi immediately followed the lady into the dining-room, where Clara\r\ngreeted her with a smile. She looked much happier than usual, for she\r\nexpected new things to happen that day. When breakfast had passed\r\nwithout disturbance, the two children were allowed to go into the\r\nlibrary together and were soon left alone.\r\n\r\n"How can I see down to the ground?" Heidi asked.\r\n\r\n"Open a window and peep out," replied Clara, amused at the question.\r\n\r\n"But it is impossible to open them," Heidi said, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Oh no. You can\'t do it and I can\'t help you, either, but if you ask\r\nSebastian he\'ll do it for you."\r\n\r\nHeidi was relieved. The poor child had felt like a prisoner in her\r\nroom. Clara now asked Heidi what her home had been like, and Heidi\r\ntold her gladly about her life in the hut.\r\n\r\nThe tutor had arrived in the meantime, but he was not asked to go to\r\nthe study as usual. Miss Rottenmeier was very much excited about\r\nHeidi\'s coming and all the complications that arose therefrom. She was\r\nreally responsible for it, having arranged everything herself. She\r\npresented the unfortunate case before the teacher, for she wanted him\r\nto help her to get rid of the child. Mr. Candidate, however, was\r\nalways careful of his judgments, and not afraid of teaching beginners.\r\n\r\nWhen the lady saw that he would not side with her, she let him enter\r\nthe study alone, for the A,B,C held great horrors for her. While she\r\nconsidered many problems, a frightful noise as of something falling\r\nwas heard in the adjoining room, followed by a cry to Sebastian for\r\nhelp. Running in, she beheld a pile of books and papers on the floor,\r\nwith the table-cover on top. A black stream of ink flowed across the\r\nlength of the room. Heidi had disappeared.\r\n\r\n"There," Miss Rottenmeier exclaimed, wringing her hands. "Everything\r\ndrenched with ink. Did such a thing ever happen before? This child\r\nbrings nothing but misfortunes on us."\r\n\r\nThe teacher was standing up, looking at the devastation, but Clara was\r\nhighly entertained by these events, and said: "Heidi has not done it\r\non purpose and must not be punished. In her hurry to get away she\r\ncaught on the table-cover and pulled it down. I think she must never\r\nhave seen a coach in all her life, for when she heard a carriage\r\nrumbling by, she rushed out like mad."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you, Mr. Candidate, that she has no idea whatever about\r\nbehavior? She does not even know that she has to sit quiet at her\r\nlessons. But where has she gone? What would Mr. Sesemann say if she\r\nshould run away?"\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rottenmeier went down-stairs to look for the child, she saw\r\nher standing at the open door, looking down the street.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here? How can you run away like that?" scolded\r\nMiss Rottenmeier.\r\n\r\n"I heard the fir-trees rustle, but I can\'t see them and do not hear\r\nthem any more," replied Heidi, looking in great perplexity down the\r\nstreet. The noise of the passing carriage had reminded her of the\r\nroaring of the south-wind on the Alp.\r\n\r\n"Fir-trees? What nonsense! We are not in a wood. Come with me now to\r\nsee what you have done." When Heidi saw the devastation that she had\r\ncaused, she was greatly surprised, for she had not noticed it in her\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n"This must never happen again," said the lady sternly. "You must sit\r\nquiet at your lessons; if you get up again I shall tie you to your\r\nchair. Do you hear me?"\r\n\r\nHeidi understood, and gave a promise to sit quietly during her lessons\r\nfrom that time on. After the servants had straightened the room, it\r\nwas late, and there was no more time for studies. Nobody had time to\r\nyawn that morning.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, while Clara was resting, Heidi was left to herself.\r\nShe planted herself in the hall and waited for the butler to come\r\nup-stairs with the silver things. When he reached the head of the\r\nstairs, she said to him: "I want to ask you something." She saw that\r\nthe butler seemed angry, so she reassured him by saying that she did\r\nnot mean any harm.\r\n\r\n"All right, Miss, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"My name is not Miss, why don\'t you call me Heidi?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Rottenmeier told me to call you Miss."\r\n\r\n"Did she? Well then, it must be so. I have three names already,"\r\nsighed the child.\r\n\r\n"What can I do for you?" asked Sebastian now.\r\n\r\n"Can you open a window for me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he replied.\r\n\r\nSebastian got a stool for Heidi, for the window-sill was too high for\r\nher to see over. In great disappointment, Heidi turned her head away.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anything but a street of stone. Is it the same way on the\r\nother side of the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Where do you go to look far down on everything?"\r\n\r\n"On a church-tower. Do you see that one over there with the golden\r\ndome? From there you can overlook everything."\r\n\r\nHeidi immediately stepped down from the stool and ran down-stairs.\r\nOpening the door, she found herself in the street, but she could not\r\nsee the tower any more. She wandered on from street to street, not\r\ndaring to accost any of the busy people. Passing a corner, she saw a\r\nboy who had a barrel-organ on his back and a curious animal on his\r\narm. Heidi ran to him and asked: "Where is the tower with the golden\r\ndome?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Who can tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Can you show me another church with a tower?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I can."\r\n\r\n"Then come and show me."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to give me for it?" said the boy, holding out his\r\nhand. Heidi had nothing in her pocket but a little flower-picture.\r\nClara had only given it to her this morning, so she was loath to part\r\nwith it. The temptation to look far down into the valley was too\r\ngreat for her, though, and she offered him the gift. The boy shook his\r\nhead, to Heidi\'s satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"What else do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Money."\r\n\r\n"I have none, but Clara has some. How much must I give you?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty pennies."\r\n\r\n"All right, but come."\r\n\r\nWhile they were wandering down the street, Heidi found out what a\r\nbarrel-organ was, for she had never seen one. When they arrived before\r\nan old church with a tower, Heidi was puzzled what to do next, but\r\nhaving discovered a bell, she pulled it with all her might. The boy\r\nagreed to wait for Heidi and show her the way home if she gave him a\r\ndouble fee.\r\n\r\nThe lock creaked now from inside, and an old man opened the door. In\r\nan angry voice, he said: "How do you dare to ring for me? Can\'t you\r\nsee that it is only for those who want to see the tower?"\r\n\r\n"But I do," said Heidi.\r\n\r\n"What do you want to see? Did anybody send you?" asked the man.\r\n\r\n"No; but I want to look down from up there."\r\n\r\n"Get home and don\'t try it again." With that the tower-keeper was\r\ngoing to shut the door, but Heidi held his coat-tails and pleaded with\r\nhim to let her come. The tower-keeper looked at the child\'s eyes,\r\nwhich were nearly full of tears.\r\n\r\n"All right, come along, if you care so much," he said, taking her by\r\nthe hand. The two climbed up now many, many steps, which got narrower\r\nall the time. When they had arrived on top, the old man lifted Heidi\r\nup to the open window.\r\n\r\nHeidi saw nothing but a sea of chimneys, roofs and towers, and her\r\nheart sank. "Oh, dear, it\'s different from the way I thought it would\r\nbe," she said.\r\n\r\n"There! what could such a little girl know about a view? We\'ll go down\r\nnow and you must promise never to ring at my tower any more."\r\n\r\nOn their way they passed an attic, where a large grey cat guarded her\r\nnew family in a basket. This cat caught half-a-dozen mice every day\r\nfor herself, for the old tower was full of rats and mice. Heidi gazed\r\nat her in surprise, and was delighted when the old man opened the\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\n"What charming kittens, what cunning little creatures!" she exclaimed\r\nin her delight, when she saw them crawling about, jumping and\r\ntumbling.\r\n\r\n"Would you like to have one?" the old man asked.\r\n\r\n"For me? to keep?" Heidi asked, for she could not believe her ears.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course. You can have several if you have room for them," the\r\nold man said, glad to find a good home for the kittens.\r\n\r\nHow happy Heidi was! Of course there was enough room in the huge\r\nhouse, and Clara would be delighted when she saw the cunning things.\r\n\r\n"How can I take them with me?" the child asked, after she had tried in\r\nvain to catch one.\r\n\r\n"I can bring them to your house, if you tell me where you live," said\r\nHeidi\'s new friend, while he caressed the old cat, who had lived with\r\nhim many years.\r\n\r\n"Bring them to Mr. Sesemann\'s house; there is a golden dog on the\r\ndoor, with a ring in his mouth."\r\n\r\nThe old man had lived in the tower a long time and knew everybody;\r\nSebastian also was a special friend of his.\r\n\r\n"I know," he said. "But to whom shall I send them? Do you belong to\r\nMr. Sesemann?"\r\n\r\n"No. Please send them to Clara; she will like them, I am sure."\r\n\r\nHeidi could hardly tear herself away from the pretty things, so the\r\nold man put one kitten in each of her pockets to console her. After\r\nthat she went away.\r\n\r\nThe boy was waiting patiently for her, and when she had taken leave of\r\nthe tower-keeper, she asked the boy: "Do you know where Mr. Sesemann\'s\r\nhouse is?"\r\n\r\n"No," was the reply.\r\n\r\nShe described it as well as she could, till the boy remembered it. Off\r\nthey started, and soon Heidi found herself pulling the door-bell. When\r\nSebastian arrived he said: "Hurry up." Heidi went in, and the boy was\r\nleft outside, for Sebastian had not even seen him.\r\n\r\n"Come up quickly, little Miss," he urged. "They are all waiting for\r\nyou in the dining-room. Miss Rottenmeier looks like a loaded cannon.\r\nHow could you run away like that?"\r\n\r\nHeidi sat down quietly on her chair. Nobody said a word, and there was\r\nan uncomfortable silence. At last Miss Rottenmeier began with a severe\r\nand solemn voice: "I shall speak with you later, Adelheid. How can you\r\nleave the house without a word? Your behavior was very remiss. The\r\nidea of walking about till so late!"\r\n\r\n"Meow!" was the reply.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t," Heidi began--"Meow!"\r\n\r\nSebastian nearly flung the dish on the table, and disappeared.\r\n\r\n"This is enough," Miss Rottenmeier tried to say, but her voice was\r\nhoarse with fury. "Get up and leave the room."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OFF THEY STARTED, AND SOON HEIDI WAS PULLING THE\r\nDOOR-BELL]\r\n\r\nHeidi got up. She began again. "I made--" "Meow! meow! meow!--"\r\n\r\n"Heidi," said Clara now, "why do you always say \'meow\' again, if you\r\nsee that Miss Rottenmeier is angry?"\r\n\r\n"I am not doing it, it\'s the kittens," she explained.\r\n\r\n"What? Cats? Kittens?" screamed the housekeeper. "Sebastian, Tinette,\r\ntake the horrible things away!" With that she ran into the study,\r\nlocking herself in, for she feared kittens beyond anything on earth.\r\nWhen Sebastian had finished his laugh, he came into the room. He had\r\nforeseen the excitement, having caught sight of the kittens when Heidi\r\ncame in. The scene was a very peaceful one now; Clara held the little\r\nkittens in her lap, and Heidi was kneeling beside her. They both\r\nplayed happily with the two graceful creatures. The butler promised to\r\nlook after the new-comers and prepared a bed for them in a basket.\r\n\r\nA long time afterwards, when it was time to go to bed, Miss\r\nRottenmeier cautiously opened the door. "Are they away?" she asked.\r\n"Yes," replied the butler, quickly seizing the kittens and taking them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe lecture that Miss Rottenmeier was going to give Heidi was\r\npostponed to the following day, for the lady was too much exhausted\r\nafter her fright. They all went quietly to bed, and the children were\r\nhappy in the thought that their kittens had a comfortable bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nGREAT DISTURBANCES IN THE SESEMANN HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA short time after the tutor had arrived next morning, the door-bell\r\nrang so violently that Sebastian thought it must be Mr. Sesemann\r\nhimself. What was his surprise when a dirty street-boy, with a\r\nbarrel-organ on his back, stood before him!\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by pulling the bell like that?" the butler said.\r\n\r\n"I want to see Clara."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you at least say \'Miss Clara\', you ragged urchin?" said\r\nSebastian harshly.\r\n\r\n"She owes me forty pennies," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"You are crazy! How do you know Miss Clara lives here?"\r\n\r\n"I showed her the way yesterday and she promised to give me forty\r\npennies."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! Miss Clara never goes out. You had better take\r\nyourself off, before I send you!"\r\n\r\nThe boy, however, did not even budge, and said: "I saw her. She has\r\ncurly hair, black eyes and talks in a funny way."\r\n\r\n"Oh," Sebastian chuckled to himself, "that was the little Miss."\r\n\r\nPulling the boy into the house, he said: "All right, you can follow\r\nme. Wait at the door till I call you, and then you can play something\r\nfor Miss Clara."\r\n\r\nKnocking at the study-door, Sebastian said, when he had entered: "A\r\nboy is here who wants to see Miss Clara."\r\n\r\nClara, delighted at his interruption, said: "Can\'t he come right up,\r\nMr. Candidate?"\r\n\r\nBut the boy was already inside, and started to play. Miss Rottenmeier\r\nwas in the adjoining room when she heard the sounds. Where did they\r\ncome from? Hurrying into the study, she saw the street-boy playing to\r\nthe eager children.\r\n\r\n"Stop! stop!" she called, but in vain, for the music drowned her\r\nvoice. Suddenly she made a big jump, for there, between her feet,\r\ncrawled a black turtle. Only when she shrieked for Sebastian could her\r\nvoice be heard. The butler came straight in, for he had seen\r\neverything behind the door, and a great scene it had been! Glued to a\r\nchair in her fright, Miss Rottenmeier called: "Send the boy away! Take\r\nthem away!"\r\n\r\nSebastian obediently pulled the boy after him; then he said: "Here are\r\nforty pennies from Miss Clara and forty more for playing. It was well\r\ndone, my boy."\r\n\r\nWith that he closed the door behind him. Miss Rottenmeier found it\r\nwiser now to stay in the study to prevent further disturbances.\r\nSuddenly there was another knock at the door. Sebastian appeared with\r\na large basket, which had been brought for Clara.\r\n\r\n"We had better have our lesson before we inspect it," said Miss\r\nRottenmeier. But Clara, turning to the tutor, asked: "Oh, please, Mr.\r\nCandidate, can\'t we just peep in, to see what it is?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that you will think of nothing else," the teacher began.\r\nJust then something in the basket, which had been only lightly\r\nfastened, moved, and one, two, three and still more little kittens\r\njumped out, scampering around the room with the utmost speed. They\r\nbounded over the tutor\'s boots and bit his trousers; they climbed up\r\non Miss Rottenmeier\'s dress and crawled around her feet. Mewing and\r\nrunning, they caused a frightful confusion. Clara called out in\r\ndelight: "Oh, look at the cunning creatures; look how they jump!\r\nHeidi, look at that one, and oh, see the one over there?"\r\n\r\nHeidi followed them about, while the teacher shook them off. When the\r\nhousekeeper had collected her wits after the great fright, she called\r\nfor the servants. They soon arrived and stored the little kittens\r\nsafely in the new bed.\r\n\r\nNo time had been found for yawning that day, either!\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Rottenmeier, who had found out the culprit, was alone with\r\nthe children in the evening, she began severely:\r\n\r\n"Adelheid, there is only one punishment for you. I am going to send\r\nyou to the cellar, to think over your dreadful misdeeds, in company\r\nwith the rats."\r\n\r\nA cellar held no terrors for Heidi, for in her grandfather\'s cellar\r\nfresh milk and the good cheese had been kept, and no rats had lodged\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut Clara shrieked: "Oh, Miss Rottenmeier, you must wait till Papa\r\ncomes home, and then he can punish Heidi."\r\n\r\nThe lady unwillingly replied: "All right, Clara, but I shall also\r\nspeak a few words to Mr. Sesemann." With those words she left the\r\nroom. Since the child\'s arrival everything had been upset, and the\r\nlady often felt discouraged, though nothing remarkable happened for a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nClara, on the contrary, enjoyed her companion\'s society, for she\r\nalways did funny things. In her lesson she could never get her letters\r\nstraight. They meant absolutely nothing to her, except that they would\r\nremind her of goats and eagles. The girls always spent their evenings\r\ntogether, and Heidi would entertain her friend with tales of her\r\nformer life, till her longing grew so great that she added: "I have to\r\ngo home now. I must go tomorrow."\r\n\r\nClara\'s soothing words and the prospect of more rolls for the\r\ngrandmother kept the child. Every day after dinner she was left alone\r\nin her room for some hours. Thinking of the green fields at home, of\r\nthe sparkling flowers on the mountains, she would sit in a corner till\r\nher desire for all those things became too great to bear. Her aunt had\r\nclearly told her that she might return, if she wished to do so, so one\r\nday she resolved to leave for the Alm-hut. In a great hurry she packed\r\nthe bread in the red shawl, and putting on her old straw hat, started\r\noff. The poor child did not get very far. At the door she encountered\r\nMiss Rottenmeier, who stared at Heidi in mute surprise.\r\n\r\n"What are you up to?" she exploded. "Haven\'t I forbidden you to run\r\naway? You look like a vagabond!"\r\n\r\n"I was only going home," whispered the frightened child.\r\n\r\n"What, you want to run away from this house? What would Mr. Sesemann\r\nsay? What is it that does not suit you here? Don\'t you get better\r\ntreatment than you deserve? Have you ever before had such food,\r\nservice and such a room? Answer!"\r\n\r\n"No," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I know that?" the furious lady proceeded. "What a thankless\r\nchild you are, just idle and good-for-nothing!"\r\n\r\nBut Heidi could not bear it any longer. She loudly wailed: "Oh, I want\r\nto go home. What will poor Snowhopper do without me? Grandmother is\r\nwaiting for me every day. Poor Thistlefinch gets blows if Peter gets\r\nno cheese, and I must see the sun again when he says good-night to the\r\nmountains. How the eagle would screech if he saw all the people here\r\nin Frankfurt!"\r\n\r\n"For mercy\'s sake, the child is crazy!" exclaimed Miss Rottenmeier,\r\nrunning up the stairs. In her hurry she had bumped into Sebastian,\r\nwho was just then coming down.\r\n\r\n"Bring the unlucky child up!" she called to him, rubbing her head.\r\n\r\n"All right, many thanks," answered the butler, rubbing his head, too,\r\nfor he had encountered something far harder than she had.\r\n\r\nWhen the butler came down, he saw Heidi standing near the door with\r\nflaming eyes, trembling all over. Cheerfully he asked: "What has\r\nhappened, little one? Do not take it to heart, and cheer up. She\r\nnearly made a hole in my head just now, but we must not get\r\ndiscouraged. Oh, no!--Come, up with you; she said so!"\r\n\r\nHeidi walked up-stairs very slowly. Seeing her so changed, Sebastian\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t give in! Don\'t be so sad! You have been so courageous till now;\r\nI have never heard you cry yet. Come up now, and when the lady\'s away\r\nwe\'ll go and look at the kittens. They are running round like wild!"\r\n\r\nNodding cheerlessly, the child disappeared in her room.\r\n\r\nThat night at supper Miss Rottenmeier watched Heidi constantly, but\r\nnothing happened. The child sat as quiet as a mouse, hardly touching\r\nher food, except the little roll.\r\n\r\nTalking with the tutor next morning, Miss Rottenmeier told him her\r\nfears about Heidi\'s mind. But the teacher had more serious troubles\r\nstill, for Heidi had not even learned her A,B,C in all this time.\r\n\r\nHeidi was sorely in need of some clothes, so Clara had given her some.\r\nMiss Rottenmeier was just busy arranging the child\'s wardrobe, when\r\nshe suddenly returned.\r\n\r\n"Adelheid," she said contemptuously, "what do I find? A big pile of\r\nbread in your wardrobe! I never heard the like. Yes, Clara, it is\r\ntrue." Then, calling Tinette, she ordered her to take away the bread\r\nand the old straw hat she had found.\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t! I must keep my hat! The bread is for grandmother," cried\r\nHeidi in despair.\r\n\r\n"You stay here, while we take the rubbish away," said the lady\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\nHeidi threw herself down now on Clara\'s chair and sobbed as if her\r\nheart would break.\r\n\r\n"Now I can\'t bring grandmother any rolls! Oh, they were for\r\ngrandmother!" she lamented.\r\n\r\n"Heidi, don\'t cry any more," Clara begged. "Listen! When you go home\r\nsome day, I am going to give you as many rolls as you had, and more.\r\nThey will be much softer and better than those stale ones you have\r\nkept. Those were not fit to eat, Heidi. Stop now, please, and don\'t\r\ncry any more!"\r\n\r\nOnly after a long, long time did Heidi become quiet. When she had\r\nheard Clara\'s promise, she cried: "Are you really going to give me as\r\nmany as I had?"\r\n\r\nAt supper, Heidi\'s eyes were swollen and it was still hard for her to\r\nkeep from crying. Sebastian made strange signs to her that she did not\r\nunderstand. What did he mean?\r\n\r\nLater, though, when she climbed into her high bed, she found her old\r\nbeloved straw hat hidden under her cover. So Sebastian had saved it\r\nfor her and had tried to tell her! She crushed it for joy, and\r\nwrapping it in a handkerchief, she hid it in the furthest corner of\r\nher wardrobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE MASTER OF THE HOUSE HEARS OF STRANGE DOINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards there was great excitement in the Sesemann\r\nresidence, for the master of the house had just arrived. The servants\r\nwere taking upstairs one load after another, for Mr. Sesemann always\r\nbrought many lovely things home with him.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered his daughter\'s room, Heidi shyly retreated into a\r\ncorner. He greeted Clara affectionately, and she was equally delighted\r\nto see him, for she loved her father dearly. Then he called to Heidi:\r\n"Oh, there is our little Swiss girl. Come and give me your hand!\r\nThat\'s right. Are you good friends, my girls, tell me now? You don\'t\r\nfight together, what?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Clara is always kind to me," Heidi replied.\r\n\r\n"Heidi has never even tried to fight, Papa," Clara quickly remarked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good, I like to hear that," said the father rising. "I must\r\nget my dinner now, for I am hungry. I shall come back soon and show\r\nyou what I have brought home with me."\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room he found Miss Rottenmeier surveying the table with\r\na most tragic face. "You do not look very happy at my arrival, Miss\r\nRottenmeier. What is the matter? Clara seems well enough," he said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Sesemann, we have been terribly disappointed," said the lady.\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?" asked Mr. Sesemann, calmly sipping his wine.\r\n\r\n"We had decided, as you know, to have a companion for Clara. Knowing\r\nas I did that you would wish me to get a noble, pure child, I thought\r\nof this Swiss child, hoping she would go through life like a breath of\r\npure air, hardly touching the earth."\r\n\r\n"I think that even Swiss children are made to touch the earth,\r\notherwise they would have to have wings."\r\n\r\n"I think you understand what I mean. I have been terribly\r\ndisappointed, for this child has brought the most frightful animals\r\ninto the house. Mr. Candidate can tell you!"\r\n\r\n"The child does not look very terrible. But what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot explain it, because she does not seem in her right mind at\r\ntimes."\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann was getting worried at last, when the tutor entered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Candidate, I hope you will explain. Please take a cup of\r\ncoffee with me and tell me about my daughter\'s companion. Make it\r\nshort, if you please!"\r\n\r\nBut this was impossible for Mr. Candidate, who had to greet Mr.\r\nSesemann first. Then he began to reassure his host about the child,\r\npointing out to him that her education had been neglected till then,\r\nand so on. But poor Mr. Sesemann, unfortunately, did not get his\r\nanswer, and had to listen to very long-winded explanations of the\r\nchild\'s character. At last Mr. Sesemann got up, saying: "Excuse me,\r\nMr. Candidate, but I must go over to Clara now."\r\n\r\nHe found the children in the study. Turning to Heidi, who had risen at\r\nhis approach, he said: "Come, little one, get me--get me a glass of\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"Fresh water?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, fresh water," he replied. When Heidi had gone, he sat down\r\nnear Clara, holding her hand. "Tell me, little Clara," he asked,\r\n"please tell me clearly what animals Heidi has brought into the house;\r\nis she really not right in her mind?"\r\n\r\nClara now began to relate to her father all the incidents with the\r\nkittens and the turtle, and explained Heidi\'s speeches that had so\r\nfrightened the lady. Mr. Sesemann laughed heartily and asked Clara if\r\nshe wished Heidi to remain.\r\n\r\n"Of course, Papa. Since she is here, something amusing happens every\r\nday; it used to be so dull, but now Heidi keeps me company."\r\n\r\n"Very good, very good, Clara; Oh! Here is your friend back again. Did\r\nyou get nice fresh water?" asked Mr. Sesemann.\r\n\r\nHeidi handed him the glass and said: "Yes, fresh from the fountain."\r\n\r\n"You did not go to the fountain yourself, Heidi?" said Clara.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, but I had to get it from far, there were so many people at\r\nthe first and at the second fountain. I had to go down another street\r\nand there I got it. A gentleman with white hair sends his regards to\r\nyou, Mr. Sesemann."\r\n\r\nClara\'s father laughed and asked: "Who was the gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"When he passed by the fountain and saw me there with a glass, he\r\nstood still and said: \'Please give me to drink, for you have a glass;\r\nto whom are you bringing the water?\' Then I said: \'I am bringing it to\r\nMr. Sesemann.\' When he heard that he laughed very loud and gave me his\r\nregards for you, with the wish that you would enjoy your drink."\r\n\r\n"I wonder who it was? What did the gentleman look like?"\r\n\r\n"He has a friendly laugh and wears a gold pendant with a red stone on\r\nhis thick gold chain; there is a horsehead on his cane."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was the doctor--" "That was my old doctor," exclaimed father\r\nand daughter at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Mr. Sesemann told Miss Rottenmeier that Heidi was\r\ngoing to remain, for the children were very fond of each other and he\r\nfound Heidi normal and very sweet. "I want the child to be treated\r\nkindly," Mr. Sesemann added decidedly. "Her peculiarities must not be\r\npunished. My mother is coming very soon to stay here, and she will\r\nhelp you to manage the child, for there is nobody in this world that\r\nmy mother could not get along with, as you know, Miss Rottenmeier."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I know that, Mr. Sesemann," replied the lady, but she was\r\nnot very much pleased at the prospect.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann only stayed two weeks, for his business called him back\r\nto Paris. He consoled his daughter by telling her that his mother was\r\ncoming in a very few days. Mr. Sesemann had hardly left, when the\r\ngrandmother\'s visit was announced for the following day.\r\n\r\nClara was looking forward to this visit, and told Heidi so much about\r\nher dear grandmama that Heidi also began to call her by that name, to\r\nMiss Rottenmeier\'s disapproval, who thought that the child was not\r\nentitled to this intimacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nA GRANDMAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following evening great expectation reigned in the house. Tinette\r\nhad put on a new cap, Sebastian was placing footstools in front of\r\nnearly every armchair, and Miss Rottenmeier walked with great dignity\r\nabout the house, inspecting everything.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage at last drove up, the servants flew downstairs,\r\nfollowed by Miss Rottenmeier in more measured step. Heidi had been\r\nsent to her room to await further orders, but it was not long before\r\nTinette opened the door and said brusquely: "Go into the study!"\r\n\r\nThe grandmama, with her kind and loving way, immediately befriended\r\nthe child and made her feel as if she had known her always. To the\r\nhousekeeper\'s great mortification, she called the child Heidi,\r\nremarking to Miss Rottenmeier: "If somebody\'s name is Heidi, I call\r\nher so."\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper soon found that she had to respect the grandmother\'s\r\nways and opinions. Mrs. Sesemann always knew what was going on in the\r\nhouse the minute she entered it. On the following afternoon Clara was\r\nresting and the old lady had shut her eyes for five minutes, when she\r\ngot up again and went into the dining-room. With a suspicion that the\r\nhousekeeper was probably asleep, she went to this lady\'s room,\r\nknocking loudly on the door. After a while somebody stirred inside,\r\nand with a bewildered face Miss Rottenmeier appeared, staring at the\r\nunexpected visitor.\r\n\r\n"Rottenmeier, where is the child? How does she pass her time? I want\r\nto know," said Mrs. Sesemann.\r\n\r\n"She just sits in her room, not moving a finger; she has not the\r\nslightest desire to do something useful, and that is why she thinks of\r\nsuch absurd things that one can hardly mention them in polite\r\nsociety."\r\n\r\n"I should do exactly the same thing, if I were left alone like that.\r\nPlease bring her to my room now, I want to show her some pretty books\r\nI have brought with me."\r\n\r\n"That is just the trouble. What should she do with books? In all this\r\ntime she has not even learned the A,B,C for it is impossible to instil\r\nany knowledge into this being. If Mr. Candidate was not as patient as\r\nan angel, he would have given up teaching her long ago."\r\n\r\n"How strange! The child does not look to me like one who cannot learn\r\nthe A,B,C," said Mrs. Sesemann. "Please fetch her now; we can look at\r\nthe pictures anyway."\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper was going to say more, but the old lady had turned\r\nalready and gone to her room. She was thinking over what she had heard\r\nabout Heidi, making up her mind to look into the matter.\r\n\r\nHeidi had come and was looking with wondering eyes at the splendid\r\npictures in the large books, that Grandmama was showing her. Suddenly\r\nshe screamed aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful flock\r\ngrazing on a green pasture. In the middle a shepherd was standing,\r\nleaning on his crook. The setting sun was shedding a golden light over\r\neverything. With glowing eyes Heidi devoured the scene; but suddenly\r\nshe began to sob violently.\r\n\r\nThe grandmama took her little hand in hers and said in the most\r\nsoothing voice: "Come, child, you must not cry. Did this remind you of\r\nsomething? Now stop, and I\'ll tell you the story to-night. There are\r\nlovely stories in this book, that people can read and tell. Dry your\r\ntears now, darling, I must ask you something. Stand up now and look at\r\nme! Now we are merry again!"\r\n\r\nHeidi did not stop at once, but the kind lady gave her ample time to\r\ncompose herself, saying from time to time: "Now it\'s all over. Now\r\nwe\'ll be merry again."\r\n\r\nWhen the child was quiet at last, she said: "Tell me now how your\r\nlessons are going. What have you learnt, child, tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," Heidi sighed; "but I knew that I never could learn it."\r\n\r\n"What is it that you can\'t learn?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t learn to read; it is too hard."\r\n\r\n"What next? Who gave you this information?"\r\n\r\n"Peter told me, and he tried over and over again, but he could not do\r\nit, for it is too hard."\r\n\r\n"Well, what kind of boy is he? Heidi, you must not believe what Peter\r\ntells you, but try for yourself. I am sure you had your thoughts\r\nelsewhere when Mr. Candidate showed you the letters."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use," Heidi said with such a tone as if she was resigned to\r\nher fate.\r\n\r\n"I am going to tell you something, Heidi," said the kind lady now.\r\n"You have not learnt to read because you have believed what Peter\r\nsaid. You shall believe me now, and I prophesy that you will learn it\r\nin a very short time, as a great many other children do that are like\r\nyou and not like Peter. When you can read, I am going to give you this\r\nbook. You have seen the shepherd on the green pasture, and then you\'ll\r\nbe able to find out all the strange things that happen to him. Yes,\r\nyou can hear the whole story, and what he does with his sheep and his\r\ngoats. You would like to know, wouldn\'t you, Heidi?"\r\n\r\nHeidi had listened attentively, and said now with sparkling eyes: "If\r\nI could only read already!"\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be long, I can see that. Come now and let us go to Clara."\r\nWith that they both went over to the study.\r\n\r\nSince the day of Heidi\'s attempted flight a great change had come over\r\nthe child. She had realized that it would hurt her kind friends if she\r\ntried to go home again. She knew now that she could not leave, as her\r\nAunt Deta had promised, for they all, especially Clara and her father\r\nand the old lady, would think her ungrateful. But the burden grew\r\nheavier in her heart and she lost her appetite, and got paler and\r\npaler. She could not get to sleep at night from longing to see the\r\nmountains with the flowers and the sunshine, and only in her dreams\r\nshe would be happy. When she woke up in the morning, she always found\r\nherself on her high white bed, far away from home. Burying her head in\r\nher pillow, she would often weep a long, long time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sesemann had noticed the child\'s unhappiness, but let a few days\r\npass by, hoping for a change. But the change never came, and often\r\nHeidi\'s eyes were red even in the early morning. So she called the\r\nchild to her room one day and said, with great sympathy in her voice:\r\n"Tell me, Heidi, what is the matter with you? What is making you so\r\nsad?"\r\n\r\nBut as Heidi did not want to appear thankless, she replied sadly: "I\r\ncan\'t tell you."\r\n\r\n"No? Can\'t you tell Clara perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I can\'t tell anyone," Heidi said, looking so unhappy that the\r\nold lady\'s heart was filled with pity.\r\n\r\n"I tell you something, little girl," she continued. "If you have a\r\nsorrow that you cannot tell to anyone, you can go to Our Father in\r\nHeaven. You can tell Him everything that troubles you, and if we ask\r\nHim He can help us and take our suffering away. Do you understand me,\r\nchild? Don\'t you pray every night? Don\'t you thank Him for all His\r\ngifts and ask Him to protect you from evil?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I never do that," replied the child.\r\n\r\n"Have you never prayed, Heidi? Do you know what I mean?"\r\n\r\n"I only prayed with my first grandmother, but it is so long ago, that\r\nI have forgotten."\r\n\r\n"See, Heidi, I understand now why you are so unhappy. We all need\r\nsomebody to help us, and just think how wonderful it is, to be able to\r\ngo to the Lord, when something distresses us and causes us pain. We\r\ncan tell Him everything and ask Him to comfort us, when nobody else\r\ncan do it. He can give us happiness and joy."\r\n\r\nHeidi was gladdened by these tidings, and asked: "Can we tell Him\r\neverything, everything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Heidi, everything."\r\n\r\nThe child, withdrawing her hand from the grandmama, said hurriedly,\r\n"Can I go now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course," was the reply, and with this Heidi ran to her room.\r\nSitting down on a stool she folded her hands and poured out her heart\r\nto God, imploring Him to help her and let her go home to her\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, Mr. Candidate asked to see Mrs. Sesemann, to tell\r\nher of something unusual that had occurred. Being called to the lady\'s\r\nroom, he began: "Mrs. Sesemann, something has happened that I never\r\nexpected," and with many more words the happy grandmama was told that\r\nHeidi had suddenly learned to read with the utmost correctness, most\r\nrare with beginners.\r\n\r\n"Many strange things happen in this world," Mrs. Sesemann remarked,\r\nwhile they went over to the study to witness Heidi\'s new\r\naccomplishment. Heidi was sitting close to Clara, reading her a story;\r\nshe seemed amazed at the strange, new world that had opened up before\r\nher. At supper Heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures\r\non her plate, and looking doubtfully at grandmama, she saw the old\r\nlady nod. "Now it belongs to you, Heidi," she said.\r\n\r\n"Forever? Also when I am going home?" Heidi inquired, confused with\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, forever!" the grandmama assured her. "Tomorrow we shall\r\nbegin to read it."\r\n\r\n"But Heidi, you must not go home; no, not for many years," Clara\r\nexclaimed, "especially when grandmama goes away. You must stay with\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHeidi still looked at her book before going to bed that night, and\r\nthis book became her dearest treasure. She would look at the beautiful\r\npictures and read all the stories aloud to Clara. Grandmama would\r\nquietly listen and explain something here and there, making it more\r\nbeautiful than before. Heidi loved the pictures with the shepherd best\r\nof all; they told the story of the prodigal son, and the child would\r\nread and re-read it till she nearly knew it all by heart. Since Heidi\r\nhad learned to read and possessed the book, the days seemed to fly,\r\nand the time had come near that the grandmama had fixed for her\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nHEIDI GAINS IN SOME RESPECTS AND LOSES IN OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandmama sent for Heidi every day after dinner, while Clara was\r\nresting and Miss Rottenmeier disappeared into her room. She talked to\r\nHeidi and amused her in various ways, showing her how to make clothes\r\nfor pretty little dolls that she had brought. Unconsciously Heidi had\r\nlearned to sew, and made now the sweetest dresses and coats for the\r\nlittle people out of lovely materials the grandmama would give her.\r\nOften Heidi would read to the old lady, for the oftener she read over\r\nthe stories the dearer they became to her. The child lived everything\r\nthrough with the people in the tales and was always happy to be with\r\nthem again. But she never looked really cheerful and her eyes never\r\nsparkled merrily as before.\r\n\r\nIn the last week of Mrs. Sesemann\'s stay, Heidi was called again to\r\nthe old lady\'s room. The child entered with her beloved book under her\r\narm. Mrs. Sesemann drew Heidi close to her, and laying the book aside,\r\nshe said: "Come, child, and tell me why you are so sad. Do you still\r\nhave the same sorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Heidi replied.\r\n\r\n"Did you confide it to Our Lord?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Do you pray to Him every day that He may make you happy again and\r\ntake your affliction away?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I don\'t pray any more."\r\n\r\n"What do I hear, Heidi? Why don\'t you pray?"\r\n\r\n"It does not help, for God has not listened. I don\'t wonder," she\r\nadded, "for if all the people in Frankfurt pray every night, He cannot\r\nlisten to them all. I am sure He has not heard me."\r\n\r\n"Really? Why are you so sure?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have prayed for the same thing many, many weeks and God has\r\nnot done what I have asked Him to."\r\n\r\n"That is not the way, Heidi. You see, God in heaven is a good Father\r\nto all of us, who knows what we need better than we do. When something\r\nwe ask for is not very good for us, He gives us something much better,\r\nif we confide in Him and do not lose confidence in His love. I am sure\r\nwhat you asked for was not very good for you just now; He has heard\r\nyou, for He can hear the prayers of all the people in the world at the\r\nsame time, because He is God Almighty and not a mortal like us. He\r\nheard your prayers and said to Himself: \'Yes, Heidi shall get what she\r\nis praying for in time.\' Now, while God was looking down on you to\r\nhear your prayers, you lost confidence and went away from Him. If God\r\ndoes not hear your prayers any more, He will forget you also and let\r\nyou go. Don\'t you want to go back to Him, Heidi, and ask His\r\nforgiveness? Pray to Him every day, and hope in Him, that He may bring\r\ncheer and happiness to you."\r\n\r\nHeidi had listened attentively; she had unbounded confidence in the\r\nold lady, whose words had made a deep impression on her. Full of\r\nrepentance, she said: "I shall go at once and ask Our Father to pardon\r\nme. I shall never forget Him any more!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Heidi; I am sure He will help you in time, if you only\r\ntrust in Him," the grandmother consoled her. Heidi went to her room\r\nnow and prayed earnestly to God that He would forgive her and fulfill\r\nher wish.\r\n\r\nThe day of departure had come, but Mrs. Sesemann arranged everything\r\nin such a way that the children hardly realized she was actually\r\ngoing. Still everything was empty and quiet when she had gone, and the\r\nchildren hardly knew how to pass their time.\r\n\r\nNext day, Heidi came to Clara in the afternoon and said: "Can I\r\nalways, always read to you now, Clara?"\r\n\r\nClara assented, and Heidi began. But she did not get very far, for the\r\nstory she was reading told of a grandmother\'s death. Suddenly she\r\ncried aloud: "Oh, now grandmother is dead!" and wept in the most\r\npitiful fashion. Whatever Heidi read always seemed real to her, and\r\nnow she thought it was her own grandmother at home. Louder and louder\r\nshe sobbed: "Now poor grandmother is dead and I can never see her any\r\nmore; and she never got one single roll!"\r\n\r\nClara attempted to explain the mistake, but Heidi was too much upset.\r\nShe pictured to herself how terrible it would be if her dear old\r\ngrandfather would die too while she was far away. How quiet and empty\r\nit would be in the hut, and how lonely she would be!\r\n\r\nMiss Rottenmeier had overheard the scene, and approaching the sobbing\r\nchild she said impatiently: "Adelheid, now you have screamed enough.\r\nIf I hear you again giving way to yourself in such a noisy fashion, I\r\nshall take your book away forever!"\r\n\r\nHeidi turned pale at that, for the book was her greatest treasure.\r\nQuickly drying her tears, she choked down her sobs. After that Heidi\r\nnever cried again; often she could hardly repress her sobs and was\r\nobliged to make the strangest faces to keep herself from crying out.\r\nClara often looked at her, full of surprise, but Miss Rottenmeier did\r\nnot notice them and found no occasion to carry out her threat.\r\nHowever, the poor child got more cheerless every day, and looked so\r\nthin and pale that Sebastian became worried. He tried to encourage her\r\nat table to help herself to all the good dishes, but listlessly she\r\nwould let them pass and hardly touch them. In the evening she would\r\ncry quietly, her heart bursting with longing to go home.\r\n\r\nThus the time passed by. Heidi never knew if it was summer or winter,\r\nfor the walls opposite never changed. They drove out very seldom, for\r\nClara was only able to go a short distance. They never saw anything\r\nelse than streets, houses and busy people; no grass, no fir-trees and\r\nno mountains. Heidi struggled constantly against her sorrow, but in\r\nvain. Autumn and winter had passed, and Heidi knew that the time was\r\ncoming when Peter would go up the Alp with his goats, where the\r\nflowers were glistening in the sunshine and the mountains were all\r\nafire. She would sit down in a corner of her room and put both hands\r\nbefore her eyes, not to see the glaring sunshine on the opposite wall.\r\nThere she would remain, eating her heart away with longing, till Clara\r\nwould call for her to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERE SHE WOULD REMAIN, EATING HER HEART AWAY WITH\r\nLONGING]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE SESEMANN HOUSE IS HAUNTED\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several days Miss Rottenmeier had been wandering silently about\r\nthe house. When she went from room to room or along the corridors, she\r\nwould often glance back as if she were afraid that somebody was\r\nfollowing her. If she had to go to the upper floor, where the gorgeous\r\nguest-rooms were, or to the lower story, where the big ball-room was\r\nsituated, she always told Tinette to come with her. The strange thing\r\nwas, that none of the servants dared to go anywhere alone and always\r\nfound an excuse to ask each other\'s company, which requests were\r\nalways granted. The cook, who had been in the house for many years,\r\nwould often shake her head and mutter: "That I should live to see\r\nthis!"\r\n\r\nSomething strange and weird was happening in the house. Every\r\nmorning, when the servants came down-stairs, they found the front door\r\nwide open. At first everybody had thought that the house must have\r\nbeen robbed, but nothing was missing. Every morning it was the same,\r\ndespite the double locks that were put on the door. At last John and\r\nSebastian, taking courage, prepared themselves to watch through a\r\nnight to see who was the ghost. Armed and provided with some\r\nstrengthening liquor, they repaired to a room down-stairs. First they\r\ntalked, but soon, getting sleepy, they leaned silently back in their\r\nchairs. When the clock from the old church tower struck one, Sebastian\r\nawoke and roused his comrade, which was no easy matter. At last,\r\nhowever, John was wide awake, and together they went out into the\r\nhall. The same moment a strong wind put out the light that John held\r\nin his hand. Rushing back, he nearly upset Sebastian, who stood behind\r\nhim, and pulling the butler back into the room, he locked the door in\r\nfurious haste. When the light was lit again, Sebastian noticed that\r\nJohn was deadly pale and trembling like an aspen leaf. Sebastian, not\r\nhaving seen anything, asked anxiously: "What is the matter? What did\r\nyou see?"\r\n\r\n"The door was open and a white form was on the stairs; it went up and\r\nwas gone in a moment," gasped John. Cold shivers ran down the butler\'s\r\nback. They sat without moving till the morning came, and then,\r\nshutting the door, they went upstairs to report to the housekeeper\r\nwhat they had seen. The lady, who was waiting eagerly, heard the tale\r\nand immediately sat down to write to Mr. Sesemann. She told him that\r\nfright had paralyzed her fingers and that terrible things were\r\nhappening in the house. Then followed a tale of the appearance of the\r\nghost. Mr. Sesemann replied that he could not leave his business, and\r\nadvised Miss Rottenmeier to ask his mother to come to stay with them,\r\nfor Mrs. Sesemann would easily despatch the ghost. Miss Rottenmeier\r\nwas offended with the tone of the letter, which did not seem to take\r\nher account seriously. Mrs. Sesemann also replied that she could not\r\ncome, so the housekeeper decided to tell the children all about it.\r\nClara, at the uncanny tale, immediately exclaimed that she would not\r\nstay alone another moment and that she wished her father to come home.\r\nThe housekeeper arranged to sleep with the frightened child, while\r\nHeidi, who did not know what ghosts were, was perfectly unmoved.\r\nAnother letter was despatched to Mr. Sesemann, telling him that the\r\nexcitement might have serious effects on his daughter\'s delicate\r\nconstitution, and mentioning several misfortunes that might probably\r\nhappen if he did not relieve the household from this terror.\r\n\r\nThis brought Mr. Sesemann. Going to his daughter\'s room after his\r\narrival, he was overjoyed to see her as well as ever. Clara was also\r\ndelighted to see her father.\r\n\r\n"What new tricks has the ghost played on you, Miss Rottenmeier?" asked\r\nMr. Sesemann with a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n"It is no joke, Mr. Sesemann," replied the lady seriously. "I am sure\r\nyou will not laugh tomorrow. Those strange events indicate that\r\nsomething secret and horrible has happened in this house in days gone\r\nby."\r\n\r\n"Is that so? this is new to me," remarked Mr. Sesemann. "But will you\r\nplease not suspect my venerable ancestors? Please call Sebastian; I\r\nwant to speak to him alone."\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann knew that the two were not on good terms, so he said to\r\nthe butler:\r\n\r\n"Come here, Sebastian, and tell me honestly, if you have played the\r\nghost for Miss Rottenmeier\'s pastime?"\r\n\r\n"No, upon my word, master; you must not think that," replied Sebastian\r\nfrankly. "I do not like it quite myself."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll show you and John what ghosts look like by day. You ought\r\nto be ashamed of yourselves, strong young men like you! Now go at once\r\nto my old friend, Dr. Classen, and tell him to come to me at nine\r\no\'clock to-night. Tell him that I came from Paris especially to\r\nconsult him, and that I want him to sit up all night with me. Do you\r\nunderstand me, Sebastian?"\r\n\r\n"Yes indeed! I shall do as you say, Mr. Sesemann." Mr. Sesemann then\r\nwent up to Clara\'s room to quiet and comfort her.\r\n\r\nPunctually at nine o\'clock the doctor arrived. Though his hair was\r\ngrey, his face was still fresh, and his eyes were lively and kind.\r\nWhen he saw his friend, he laughed aloud and said: "Well, well, you\r\nlook pretty healthy for one who needs to be watched all night."\r\n\r\n"Have patience, my old friend," replied Mr. Sesemann. "I am afraid the\r\nperson we have to sit up for will look worse, but first we must catch\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"What? Then somebody _is_ sick in this house? What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Far worse, doctor, far worse. A ghost is in the house. My house is\r\nhaunted."\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor laughed, Mr. Sesemann continued: "I call that\r\nsympathy; I wish my friend Miss Rottenmeier could hear you. She is\r\nconvinced that an old Sesemann is wandering about, expiating some\r\ndreadful deed."\r\n\r\n"How did she make his acquaintance?" asked the doctor, much amused.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann then explained the circumstances. He said that the matter\r\nwas either a bad joke which an acquaintance of the servants was\r\nplaying in his absence, or it was a gang of thieves, who, after\r\nintimidating the people, would surely rob his house by and by.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations they entered the room where the two servants\r\nhad watched before. A few bottles of wine stood on the table and two\r\nbright candelabra shed a brilliant light. Two revolvers were ready for\r\nemergencies.\r\n\r\nThey left the door only partly open, for too much light might drive\r\nthe ghost away. Then, sitting down comfortably, the two men passed\r\ntheir time by chatting, taking a sip now and then.\r\n\r\n"The ghost seems to have spied us and probably won\'t come to-day,"\r\nsaid the doctor.\r\n\r\n"We must have patience. It is supposed to come at one," replied his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nSo they talked till one o\'clock. Everything was quiet, and not a sound\r\ncame from the street. Suddenly the doctor raised his finger.\r\n\r\n"Sh! Sesemann, don\'t you hear something?"\r\n\r\nWhile they both listened, the bar was unfastened, the key was turned,\r\nand the door flew open. Mr. Sesemann seized his revolver.\r\n\r\n"You are not afraid, I hope?" said the doctor, getting up.\r\n\r\n"Better be cautious!" whispered Mr. Sesemann, seizing the candelabrum\r\nin the other hand. The doctor followed with his revolver and the\r\nlight, and so they went out into the hall.\r\n\r\nOn the threshhold stood a motionless white form, lighted up by the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n"Who is there?" thundered the doctor, approaching the figure. It\r\nturned and uttered a low shriek. There stood Heidi, with bare feet and\r\nin her white night-gown, looking bewildered at the bright light and\r\nthe weapons. She was shaking with fear, while the two men were looking\r\nat her in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Sesemann, this seems to be your little water carrier," said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"Child, what does this mean?" asked Mr. Sesemann. "What did you want\r\nto do? Why have you come down here?"\r\n\r\nPale from fright, Heidi said: "I do not know."\r\n\r\nThe doctor came forward now. "Sesemann, this case belongs to my field.\r\nPlease go and sit down while I take her to bed."\r\n\r\nPutting his revolver aside, he led the trembling child up-stairs.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid; just be quiet! Everything is all right; don\'t be\r\nfrightened."\r\n\r\nWhen they had arrived in Heidi\'s room, the doctor put the little girl\r\nto bed, covering her up carefully. Drawing a chair near the couch, he\r\nwaited till Heidi had calmed down and had stopped trembling. Then\r\ntaking her hand in his, he said kindly: "Now everything is all right\r\nagain. Tell me where you wanted to go?"\r\n\r\n"I did not want to go anywhere," Heidi assured him; "I did not go\r\nmyself, only I was there all of a sudden."\r\n\r\n"Really! Tell me, what did you dream?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have the same dream every night. I always think I am with my\r\ngrandfather again and can hear the fir-trees roar. I always think how\r\nbeautiful the stars must be, and then I open the door of the hut, and\r\noh, it is so wonderful! But when I wake up I am always in Frankfurt."\r\nHeidi had to fight the sobs that were rising in her throat.\r\n\r\n"Does your back or your head hurt you, child?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I feel as if a big stone was pressing me here."\r\n\r\n"As if you had eaten something that disagreed with you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, but as if I wanted to cry hard."\r\n\r\n"So, and then you cry out, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I must never do that, for Miss Rottenmeier has forbidden it."\r\n\r\n"Then you swallow it down? Yes? Do you like to be here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," was the faint, uncertain reply.\r\n\r\n"Where did you live with your grandfather?"\r\n\r\n"Up on the Alp."\r\n\r\n"But wasn\'t it a little lonely there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it was so beautiful!"--But Heidi could say no more. The\r\nrecollection, the excitement of the night and all the restrained\r\nsorrow overpowered the child. The tears rushed violently from her eyes\r\nand she broke out into loud sobs.\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose, and soothing her, said: "It won\'t hurt to cry; you\'ll\r\ngo to sleep afterward, and when you wake up everything will come\r\nright." Then he left the room.\r\n\r\nJoining his anxious friend down-stairs, he said: "Sesemann, the little\r\ngirl is a sleep-walker, and has unconsciously scared your whole\r\nhousehold. Besides, she is so home-sick that her little body has\r\nwasted away. We shall have to act quickly. The only remedy for her is\r\nto be restored to her native mountain air. This is my prescription,\r\nand she must go tomorrow."\r\n\r\n"What, sick, a sleep-walker, and wasted away in my house! Nobody even\r\nsuspected it! You think I should send this child back in this\r\ncondition, when she has come in good health? No, doctor, ask\r\neverything but that. Take her in hand and prescribe for her, but let\r\nher get well before I send her back."\r\n\r\n"Sesemann," the doctor replied seriously, "just think what you are\r\ndoing. We cannot cure her with powders and pills. The child has not a\r\nstrong constitution, and if you keep her here, she might never get\r\nwell again. If you restore her to the bracing mountain air to which\r\nshe is accustomed, she probably will get perfectly well again."\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Sesemann heard this he said, "If that is your advice, we must\r\nact at once; this is the only way then." With these words Mr. Sesemann\r\ntook his friend\'s arm and walked about with him to talk the matter\r\nover. When everything was settled, the doctor took his leave, for the\r\nmorning had already come and the sun was shining in through the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nUP THE ALP ON A SUMMER EVENING\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann, going upstairs in great agitation, knocked at the\r\nhousekeeper\'s door. He asked her to hurry, for preparations for a\r\njourney had to be made. Miss Rottenmeier obeyed the summons with the\r\ngreatest indignation, for it was only half-past four in the morning.\r\nShe dressed in haste, though with great difficulty, being nervous and\r\nexcited. All the other servants were summoned likewise, and one and\r\nall thought that the master of the house had been seized by the ghost\r\nand that he was ringing for help. When they had all come down with\r\nterrified looks, they were most surprised to see Mr. Sesemann fresh\r\nand cheerful, giving orders. John was sent to get the horses ready and\r\nTinette was told to prepare Heidi for her departure while Sebastian\r\nwas commissioned to fetch Heidi\'s aunt. Mr. Sesemann instructed the\r\nhousekeeper to pack a trunk in all haste for Heidi.\r\n\r\nMiss Rottenmeier experienced an extreme disappointment, for she had\r\nhoped for an explanation of the great mystery. But Mr. Sesemann,\r\nevidently not in the mood to converse further, went to his daughter\'s\r\nroom. Clara had been wakened by the unusual noises and was listening\r\neagerly. Her father told her of what had happened and how the doctor\r\nhad ordered Heidi back to her home, because her condition was serious\r\nand might get worse. She might even climb the roof, or be exposed to\r\nsimilar dangers, if she was not cured at once.\r\n\r\nClara was painfully surprised and tried to prevent her father from\r\ncarrying out his plan. He remained firm, however, promising to take\r\nher to Switzerland himself the following summer, if she was good and\r\nsensible now. So the child, resigning herself, begged to have Heidi\'s\r\ntrunk packed in her room. Mr. Sesemann encouraged her to get together\r\na good outfit for her little friend.\r\n\r\nHeidi\'s aunt had arrived in the meantime. Being told to take her niece\r\nhome with her, she found no end of excuses, which plainly showed that\r\nshe did not want to do it; for Deta well remembered the uncle\'s\r\nparting words. Mr. Sesemann dismissed her and summoned Sebastian. The\r\nbutler was told to get ready for travelling with the child. He was to\r\ngo to Basle that day and spend the night at a good hotel which his\r\nmaster named. The next day the child was to be brought to her home.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Sebastian," Mr. Sesemann said, "and do exactly as I tell you.\r\nI know the Hotel in Basle, and if you show my card they will give you\r\ngood accommodations. Go to the child\'s room and barricade the windows,\r\nso that they can only be opened by the greatest force. When Heidi has\r\ngone to bed, lock the door from outside, for the child walks in her\r\nsleep and might come to harm in the strange hotel. She might get up\r\nand open the door; do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!--Oh!--So it was she?" exclaimed the butler.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was! You are a coward, and you can tell John he is the same.\r\nSuch foolish men, to be afraid!" With that Mr. Sesemann went to his\r\nroom to write a letter to Heidi\'s grandfather.\r\n\r\nSebastian, feeling ashamed, said to himself that he ought to have\r\nresisted John and found out alone.\r\n\r\nHeidi was dressed in her Sunday frock and stood waiting for further\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann called her now. "Good-morning, Mr. Sesemann," Heidi said\r\nwhen she entered.\r\n\r\n"What do you think about it, little one?" he asked her. Heidi looked\r\nup to him in amazement.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t seem to know anything about it," laughed Mr. Sesemann.\r\nTinette had not even told the child, for she thought it beneath her\r\ndignity to speak to the vulgar Heidi.\r\n\r\n"You are going home to-day."\r\n\r\n"Home?" Heidi repeated in a low voice. She had to gasp, so great was\r\nher surprise.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you like to hear something about it?" asked Mr. Sesemann\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I should like to," said the blushing child.\r\n\r\n"Good, good," said the kind gentleman. "Sit down and eat a big\r\nbreakfast now, for you are going away right afterwards."\r\n\r\nThe child could not even swallow a morsel, though she tried to eat out\r\nof obedience. It seemed to her as if it was only a dream.\r\n\r\n"Go to Clara, Heidi, till the carriage comes," Mr. Sesemann said\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\nHeidi had been wishing to go, and now she ran to Clara\'s room, where a\r\nhuge trunk was standing.\r\n\r\n"Heidi, look at the things I had packed for you. Do you like them?"\r\nClara asked.\r\n\r\nThere were a great many lovely things in it, but Heidi jumped for joy\r\nwhen she discovered a little basket with twelve round white rolls for\r\nthe grandmother. The children had forgotten that the moment for\r\nparting had come, when the carriage was announced. Heidi had to get\r\nall her own treasures from her room yet. The grandmama\'s book was\r\ncarefully packed, and the red shawl that Miss Rottenmeier had\r\npurposely left behind. Then putting on her pretty hat, she left her\r\nroom to say good-bye to Clara. There was not much time left to do so,\r\nfor Mr. Sesemann was waiting to put Heidi in the carriage. When Miss\r\nRottenmeier, who was standing on the stairs to bid farewell to her\r\npupil, saw the red bundle in Heidi\'s hand, she seized it and threw it\r\non the ground. Heidi looked imploringly at her kind protector, and Mr.\r\nSesemann, seeing how much she treasured it, gave it back to her. The\r\nhappy child at parting thanked him for all his goodness. She also sent\r\na message of thanks to the good old doctor, whom she suspected to be\r\nthe real cause of her going.\r\n\r\nWhile Heidi was being lifted into the carriage, Mr. Sesemann assured\r\nher that Clara and he would never forget her. Sebastian followed with\r\nHeidi\'s basket and a large bag with provisions. Mr. Sesemann called\r\nout: "Happy journey!" and the carriage rolled away.\r\n\r\nOnly when Heidi was sitting in the train did she become conscious of\r\nwhere she was going. She knew now that she would really see her\r\ngrandfather and the grandmother again, also Peter and the goats. Her\r\nonly fear was that the poor blind grandmother might have died while\r\nshe was away.\r\n\r\nThe thing she looked forward to most was giving the soft white rolls\r\nto the grandmother. While she was musing over all these things, she\r\nfell asleep. In Basle she was roused by Sebastian, for there they were\r\nto spend the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they started off again, and it took them many hours\r\nbefore they reached Mayenfeld. When Sebastian stood on the platform of\r\nthe station, he wished he could have travelled further in the train\r\nrather than have to climb a mountain. The last part of the trip might\r\nbe dangerous, for everything seemed half-wild in this country. Looking\r\nround, he discovered a small wagon with a lean horse. A\r\nbroad-shouldered man was just loading up large bags, which had come by\r\nthe train. Sebastian, approaching the man, asked some information\r\nconcerning the least dangerous ascent to the Alp. After a while it was\r\nsettled that the man should take Heidi and her trunk to the village\r\nand see to it that somebody would go up with her from there.\r\n\r\nNot a word had escaped Heidi, until she now said, "I can go up alone\r\nfrom the village. I know the road." Sebastian felt relieved, and\r\ncalling Heidi to him, presented her with a heavy roll of bills and a\r\nletter for the grandfather. These precious things were put at the\r\nbottom of the basket, under the rolls, so that they could not possibly\r\nget lost.\r\n\r\nHeidi promised to be careful of them, and was lifted up to the cart.\r\nThe two old friends shook hands and parted, and Sebastian, with a\r\nslightly bad conscience for having deserted the child so soon, sat\r\ndown on the station to wait for a returning train.\r\n\r\nThe driver was no other than the village baker, who had never seen\r\nHeidi but had heard a great deal about her. He had known her parents\r\nand immediately guessed she was the child who had lived with the\r\nAlm-Uncle. Curious to know why she came home again, he began a\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"Are you Heidi, the child who lived with the Alm-Uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why are you coming home again? Did you get on badly?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; nobody could have got on better than I did in Frankfurt."\r\n\r\n"Then why are you coming back?"\r\n\r\n"Because Mr. Sesemann let me come."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! why didn\'t you stay?"\r\n\r\n"Because I would rather be with my grandfather on the Alp than\r\nanywhere on earth."\r\n\r\n"You may think differently when you get there," muttered the baker.\r\n"It is strange though, for she must know," he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThey conversed no more, and Heidi began to tremble with excitement\r\nwhen she recognized all the trees on the road and the lofty peaks of\r\nthe mountains. Sometimes she felt as if she could not sit still any\r\nlonger, but had to jump down and run with all her might. They arrived\r\nat the village at the stroke of five. Immediately a large group of\r\nwomen and children surrounded the cart, for the trunk and the little\r\npassenger had attracted everybody\'s notice. When Heidi had been lifted\r\ndown, she found herself held and questioned on all sides. But when\r\nthey saw how frightened she was, they let her go at last. The baker\r\nhad to tell of Heidi\'s arrival with the strange gentleman, and assured\r\nall the people that Heidi loved her grandfather with all her heart,\r\nlet the people say what they would about him.\r\n\r\nHeidi, in the meantime, was running up the path; from time to time she\r\nwas obliged to stop, for her basket was heavy and she lost her\r\nbreath. Her one idea was: "If only grandmother still sits in her\r\ncorner by her spinning wheel!--Oh, if she should have died!" When the\r\nchild caught sight of the hut at last, her heart began to beat. The\r\nquicker she ran, the more it beat, but at last she tremblingly opened\r\nthe door. She ran into the middle of the room, unable to utter one\r\ntone, she was so out of breath.\r\n\r\n"Oh God," it sounded from one corner, "our Heidi used to come in like\r\nthat. Oh, if I just could have her again with me before I die. Who has\r\ncome?"\r\n\r\n"Here I am! grandmother, here I am!" shouted the child, throwing\r\nherself on her knees before the old woman. She seized her hands and\r\narms and snuggling up to her did not for joy utter one more word. The\r\ngrandmother had been so surprised that she could only silently caress\r\nthe child\'s curly hair over and over again. "Yes, yes," she said at\r\nlast, "this is Heidi\'s hair, and her beloved voice. Oh my God, I thank\r\nThee for this happiness." Out of her blind eyes big tears of joy fell\r\ndown on Heidi\'s hand. "Is it really you, Heidi? Have you really come\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, grandmother," the child replied. "You must not cry, for I\r\nhave come and will never leave you any more. Now you won\'t have to eat\r\nhard black bread any more for a little while. Look what I have brought\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHeidi put one roll after another into the grandmother\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Ah, child, what a blessing you bring to me!" the old woman cried.\r\n"But you are my greatest blessing yourself, Heidi!" Then, caressing\r\nthe child\'s hair and flushed cheeks, she entreated: "Just say one more\r\nword, that I may hear your voice."\r\n\r\nWhile Heidi was talking, Peter\'s mother arrived, and exclaimed in her\r\namazement: "Surely, this is Heidi. But how can that be?"\r\n\r\nThe child rose to shake hands with Brigida, who could not get over\r\nHeidi\'s splendid frock and hat.\r\n\r\n"You can have my hat, I don\'t want it any more; I have my old one\r\nstill," Heidi said, pulling out her old crushed straw hat. Heidi had\r\nremembered her grandfather\'s words to Deta about her feather hat; that\r\nwas why she had kept her old hat so carefully. Brigida at last\r\naccepted the gift after a great many remonstrances. Suddenly Heidi\r\ntook off her pretty dress and tied her old shawl about her. Taking the\r\ngrandmother\'s hand, she said: "Good-bye, I must go home to grandfather\r\nnow, but I shall come again tomorrow. Good-night, grandmother."\r\n\r\n"Oh, please come again to-morrow, Heidi," implored the old woman,\r\nwhile she held her fast.\r\n\r\n"Why did you take your pretty dress off?" asked Brigida.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather go to grandfather that way, or else he might not know me\r\nany more, the way you did."\r\n\r\nBrigida accompanied the child outside and said mysteriously: "He would\r\nhave known you in your frock; you ought to have kept it on. Please be\r\ncareful, child, for Peter tells us that the uncle never says a word\r\nto anyone and always seems so angry." But Heidi was unconcerned, and\r\nsaying good-night, climbed up the path with the basket on her arm. The\r\nevening sun was shining down on the grass before her. Every few\r\nminutes Heidi stood still to look at the mountains behind her.\r\nSuddenly she looked back and beheld such glory as she had not even\r\nseen in her most vivid dream. The rocky peaks were flaming in the\r\nbrilliant light, the snow-fields glowed and rosy clouds were floating\r\noverhead. The grass was like an expanse of gold, and below her the\r\nvalley swam in golden mist. The child stood still, and in her joy and\r\ntransport tears ran down her cheeks. She folded her hands, and looking\r\nup to heaven, thanked the Lord that He had brought her home again. She\r\nthanked Him for restoring her to her beloved mountains,--in her\r\nhappiness she could hardly find words to pray. Only when the glow had\r\nsubsided, was Heidi able to follow the path again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THROWING HERSELF IN HER GRANDFATHER\'S ARMS, SHE HELD\r\nHIM TIGHT]\r\n\r\nShe climbed so fast that she could soon discover, first the tree-tops,\r\nthen the roof, finally the hut. Now she could see her grandfather\r\nsitting on his bench, smoking a pipe. Above the cottage the fir-trees\r\ngently swayed and rustled in the evening breeze. At last she had\r\nreached the hut, and throwing herself in her grandfather\'s arms, she\r\nhugged him and held him tight. She could say nothing but "Grandfather!\r\ngrandfather! grandfather!" in her agitation.\r\n\r\nThe old man said nothing either, but his eyes were moist, and\r\nloosening Heidi\'s arms at last, he sat her on his knee. When he had\r\nlooked at her a while, he said: "So you have come home again, Heidi?\r\nWhy? You certainly do not look very cityfied! Did they send you away?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, you must not think that, grandfather. They all were so good to\r\nme; Clara, Mr. Sesemann and grandmama. But grandfather, sometimes I\r\nfelt as if I could not bear it any longer to be away from you! I\r\nthought I should choke; I could not tell any one, for that would have\r\nbeen ungrateful. Suddenly, one morning Mr. Sesemann called me very\r\nearly, I think it was the doctor\'s fault and--but I think it is\r\nprobably written in this letter;" with that Heidi brought the letter\r\nand the bank-roll from her basket, putting them on her grandfather\'s\r\nlap.\r\n\r\n"This belongs to you," he said, laying the roll beside him. Having\r\nread the letter, he put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?" he asked,\r\nwhile he stepped into the cottage. "Take your money with you, you can\r\nbuy a bed for it and clothes for many years."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t need it at all, grandfather," Heidi assured him; "I have a\r\nbed and Clara has given me so many dresses that I shan\'t need any more\r\nall my life."\r\n\r\n"Take it and put it in the cupboard, for you will need it some day."\r\n\r\nHeidi obeyed, and danced around the hut in her delight to see all the\r\nbeloved things again. Running up to the loft, she exclaimed in great\r\ndisappointment: "Oh grandfather, my bed is gone."\r\n\r\n"It will come again," the grandfather called up from below; "how could\r\nI know that you were coming back? Get your milk now!"\r\n\r\nHeidi, coming down, took her old seat. She seized her bowl and emptied\r\nit eagerly, as if it was the most wonderful thing she had ever tasted.\r\n"Grandfather, our milk is the best in all the world."\r\n\r\nSuddenly Heidi, hearing a shrill whistle, rushed outside, as Peter and\r\nall his goats came racing down. Heidi greeted the boy, who stopped,\r\nrooted to the spot, staring at her. Then she ran into the midst of her\r\nbeloved friends, who had not forgotten her either. Schwaenli and Baerli\r\nbleated for joy, and all her other favorites pressed near to her.\r\nHeidi was beside herself with joy, and caressed little Snowhopper and\r\npatted Thistlefinch, till she felt herself pushed to and fro among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Peter, why don\'t you come down and say good-night to me?" Heidi\r\ncalled to the boy.\r\n\r\n"Have you come again?" he exclaimed at last. Then he took Heidi\'s\r\nproffered hand and asked her, as if she had been always there: "Are\r\nyou coming up with me to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"No, to-morrow I must go to grandmother, but perhaps the day after."\r\n\r\nPeter had a hard time with his goats that day, for they would not\r\nfollow him. Over and over again they came back to Heidi, till she\r\nentered the shed with Baerli and Schwaenli and shut the door.\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi went up to her loft to sleep, she found a fresh, fragrant\r\nbed waiting for her; and she slept better that night than she had for\r\nmany, many months, for her great and burning longing had been\r\nsatisfied. About ten times that night the grandfather rose from his\r\ncouch to listen to Heidi\'s quiet breathing. The window was filled up\r\nwith hay, for from now on the moon was not allowed to shine on Heidi\r\nany more. But Heidi slept quietly, for she had seen the flaming\r\nmountains and had heard the fir-trees roar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nON SUNDAY WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS RING\r\n\r\n\r\nHeidi was standing under the swaying fir-trees, waiting for her\r\ngrandfather to join her. He had promised to bring up her trunk from\r\nthe village while she went in to visit the grandmother. The child was\r\nlonging to see the blind woman again and to hear how she had liked the\r\nrolls. It was Saturday, and the grandfather had been cleaning the\r\ncottage. Soon he was ready to start. When they had descended and Heidi\r\nentered Peter\'s hut, the grandmother called lovingly to her: "Have you\r\ncome again, child?"\r\n\r\nShe took hold of Heidi\'s hand and held it tight. Grandmother then told\r\nthe little visitor how good the rolls had tasted, and how much\r\nstronger she felt already. Brigida related further that the\r\ngrandmother had only eaten a single roll, being so afraid to finish\r\nthem too soon. Heidi had listened attentively, and said now:\r\n"Grandmother, I know what I shall do. I am going to write to Clara and\r\nshe\'ll surely send me a whole lot more."\r\n\r\nBut Brigida remarked: "That is meant well, but they get hard so soon.\r\nIf I only had a few extra pennies, I could buy some from our baker. He\r\nmakes them too, but I am hardly able to pay for the black bread."\r\n\r\nHeidi\'s face suddenly shone. "Oh, grandmother, I have an awful lot of\r\nmoney," she cried. "Now I know what I\'ll do with it. Every day you\r\nmust have a fresh roll and two on Sundays. Peter can bring them up\r\nfrom the village."\r\n\r\n"No, no, child," the grandmother implored. "That must not be. You must\r\ngive it to grandfather and he\'ll tell you what to do with it."\r\n\r\nBut Heidi did not listen but jumped gaily about the little room,\r\ncalling over and over again: "Now grandmother can have a roll every\r\nday. She\'ll get well and strong, and," she called with fresh delight,\r\n"maybe your eyes will see again, too, when you are strong and well."\r\n\r\nThe grandmother remained silent, not to mar the happiness of the\r\nchild. Seeing the old hymn-book on the shelf, Heidi said:\r\n\r\n"Grandmother, shall I read you a song from your book now? I can read\r\nquite nicely!" she added after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I wish you would, child. Can you really read?"\r\n\r\nHeidi, climbing on a chair, took down the dusty book from a shelf.\r\nAfter she had carefully wiped it off, she sat down on a stool.\r\n\r\n"What shall I read, grandmother?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever you want to," was the reply. Turning the pages, Heidi found\r\na song about the sun, and decided to read that aloud. More and more\r\neagerly she read, while the grandmother, with folded arms, sat in her\r\nchair. An expression of indescribable happiness shone in her\r\ncountenance, though tears were rolling down her cheeks. When Heidi\r\nhad repeated the end of the song a number of times, the old woman\r\nexclaimed: "Oh, Heidi, everything seems bright to me again and my\r\nheart is light. Thank you, child, you have done me so much good."\r\n\r\nHeidi looked enraptured at the grandmother\'s face, which had changed\r\nfrom an old, sorrowful expression to a joyous one.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to look up gratefully, as if she could already behold the\r\nlovely, celestial gardens told of in the hymn.\r\n\r\nSoon the grandfather knocked on the window, for it was time to go.\r\nHeidi followed quickly, assuring the grandmother that she would visit\r\nher every day now; on the days she went up to the pasture with Peter,\r\nshe would return in the early afternoon, for she did not want to miss\r\nthe chance to make the grandmother\'s heart joyful and light. Brigida\r\nurged Heidi to take her dress along, and with it on her arm the child\r\njoined the old man and immediately told him what had happened.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of her plan to purchase rolls for the grandmother every\r\nday, the grandfather reluctantly consented.\r\n\r\nAt this the child gave a bound, shouting: "Oh grandfather, now\r\ngrandmother won\'t ever have to eat hard, black bread any more. Oh,\r\neverything is so wonderful now! If God Our Father had done immediately\r\nwhat I prayed for, I should have come home at once and could not have\r\nbrought half as many rolls to grandmother. I should not have been able\r\nto read either. Grandmama told me that God would make everything much\r\nbetter than I could ever dream. I shall always pray from now on, the\r\nway grandmama taught me. When God does not give me something I pray\r\nfor, I shall always remember how everything has worked out for the\r\nbest this time. We\'ll pray every day, grandfather, won\'t we, for\r\notherwise God might forget us."\r\n\r\n"And if somebody should forget to do it?" murmured the old man.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'ll get on badly, for God will forget him, too. If he is\r\nunhappy and wretched, people don\'t pity him, for they will say: \'he\r\nwent away from God, and now the Lord, who alone can help him, has no\r\npity on him\'."\r\n\r\n"Is that true, Heidi? Who told you so?"\r\n\r\n"Grandmama explained it all to me."\r\n\r\nAfter a pause the grandfather said: "Yes, but if it has happened, then\r\nthere is no help; nobody can come back to the Lord, when God has once\r\nforgotten him."\r\n\r\n"But grandfather, everybody can come back to Him; grandmama told me\r\nthat, and besides there is the beautiful story in my book. Oh,\r\ngrandfather, you don\'t know it yet, and I shall read it to you as soon\r\nas we get home."\r\n\r\nThe grandfather had brought a big basket with him, in which he carried\r\nhalf the contents of Heidi\'s trunk; it had been too large to be\r\nconveyed up the steep ascent. Arriving at the hut and setting down his\r\nload, he had to sit beside Heidi, who was ready to begin the tale.\r\nWith great animation Heidi read the story of the prodigal son, who\r\nwas happy at home with his father\'s cows and sheep. The picture showed\r\nhim leaning on his staff, watching the sunset. "Suddenly he wanted to\r\nhave his own inheritance, and be able to be his own master. Demanding\r\nthe money from his father, he went away and squandered all. When he\r\nhad nothing in the world left, he had to go as servant to a peasant,\r\nwho did not own fine cattle like his father, but only swine; his\r\nclothes were rags, and for food he only got the husks on which the\r\npigs were fed. Often he would think what a good home he had left, and\r\nwhen he remembered how good his father had been to him and his own\r\nungratefulness, he would cry from repentance and longing. Then he said\r\nto himself: \'I shall go to my father and ask his forgiveness.\' When he\r\napproached his former home, his father came out to meet him--"\r\n\r\n"What do you think will happen now?" Heidi asked. "You think that the\r\nfather is angry and will say: \'Didn\'t I tell you?\' But just listen:\r\n\'And his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his\r\nneck. And the son said: Father, I have sinned against Heaven and in\r\nThy sight, and am no more worthy to be called Thy son. But the father\r\nsaid to his servants: Bring forth the best robe and put it on him; and\r\nput a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet; and bring hither the\r\nfatted calf and kill it; and let us eat and be merry: For this my son\r\nwas dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.\' And they\r\nbegan to be merry."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a beautiful story, grandfather?" asked Heidi, when he sat\r\nsilently beside her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Heidi, it is," said the grandfather, but so seriously that Heidi\r\nquietly looked at the pictures. "Look how happy he is," she said,\r\npointing to it.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, when Heidi was sleeping soundly, the old man\r\nclimbed up the ladder. Placing a little lamp beside the sleeping\r\nchild, he watched her a long, long time. Her little hands were folded\r\nand her rosy face looked confident and peaceful. The old man now\r\nfolded his hands and said in a low voice, while big tears rolled down\r\nhis cheeks: "Father, I have sinned against Heaven and Thee, and am no\r\nmore worthy to be Thy son!"\r\n\r\nThe next morning found the uncle standing before the door, looking\r\nabout him over valley and mountain. A few early bells sounded from\r\nbelow and the birds sang their morning anthems.\r\n\r\nRe-entering the house, he called: "Heidi, get up! The sun is shining!\r\nPut on a pretty dress, for we are going to church!"\r\n\r\nThat was a new call, and Heidi obeyed quickly. When the child came\r\ndownstairs in her smart little frock, she opened her eyes wide. "Oh,\r\ngrandfather!" she exclaimed, "I have never seen you in your Sunday\r\ncoat with the silver buttons. Oh, how fine you look!"\r\n\r\nThe old man, turning to the child, said with a smile: "You look nice,\r\ntoo; come now!" With Heidi\'s hand in his they wandered down together.\r\nThe nearer they came to the village, the louder and richer the bells\r\nresounded. "Oh grandfather, do you hear it? It seems like a big, high\r\nfeast," said Heidi.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the church, all the people were singing. Though they\r\nsat down on the last bench behind, the people had noticed their\r\npresence and whispered it from ear to ear. When the pastor began to\r\npreach, his words were a loud thanksgiving that moved all his hearers.\r\nAfter the service the old man and the child walked to the parsonage.\r\nThe clergyman had opened the door and received them with friendly\r\nwords. "I have come to ask your forgiveness for my harsh words," said\r\nthe uncle. "I want to follow your advice to spend the winter here\r\namong you. If the people look at me askance, I can\'t expect any\r\nbetter. I am sure, Mr. Pastor, you will not do so."\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: WITH HEIDI\'S HAND IN HIS THEY WANDERED DOWN\r\n   TOGETHER]\r\n\r\nThe pastor\'s friendly eyes sparkled, and with many a kind word he\r\ncommended the uncle for this change, and putting his hand on Heidi\'s\r\ncurly hair, ushered them out. Thus the people, who had been all\r\ntalking together about this great event, could see that their\r\nclergyman shook hands with the old man. The door of the parsonage was\r\nhardly shut, when the whole assembly came forward with outstretched\r\nhands and friendly greetings. Great seemed to be their joy at the old\r\nman\'s resolution; some of the people even accompanied him on his\r\nhomeward way. When they had parted at last, the uncle looked after\r\nthem with his face shining as with an inward light. Heidi looked up to\r\nhim and said: "Grandfather, you have never looked so beautiful!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think so, child?" he said with a smile. "You see, Heidi, I am\r\nmore happy than I deserve; to be at peace with God and men makes one\'s\r\nheart feel light. God has been good to me, to send you back."\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Peter\'s hut, the grandfather opened the door and\r\nentered. "How do you do, grandmother," he called out. "I think we\r\nmust start to mend again, before the fall wind comes."\r\n\r\n"Oh my God, the uncle!" exclaimed the grandmother in joyous surprise.\r\n"How happy I am to be able to thank you for what you have done, uncle!\r\nThank you, God bless you for it."\r\n\r\nWith trembling joy the grandmother shook hands with her old friend.\r\n"There is something else I want to say to you, uncle," she continued.\r\n"If I have ever hurt you in any way, do not punish me. Do not let\r\nHeidi go away again before I die. I cannot tell you what Heidi means\r\nto me!" So saying, she held the clinging child to her.\r\n\r\n"No danger of that, grandmother, I hope we shall all stay together now\r\nfor many years to come."\r\n\r\nBrigida now showed Heidi\'s feather hat to the old man and asked him to\r\ntake it back. But the uncle asked her to keep it, since Heidi had\r\ngiven it to her.\r\n\r\n"What blessings this child has brought from Frankfurt," Brigida said.\r\n"I often wondered if I should not send our little Peter too. What do\r\nyou think, uncle?"\r\n\r\nThe uncle\'s eyes sparkled with fun, when he replied: "I am sure it\r\nwould not hurt Peter; nevertheless I should wait for a fitting\r\noccasion before I sent him."\r\n\r\nThe next moment Peter himself arrived in great haste. He had a letter\r\nfor Heidi, which had been given to him in the village. What an event,\r\na letter for Heidi! They all sat down at the table while the child\r\nread it aloud. The letter was from Clara Sesemann, who wrote that\r\neverything had got so dull since Heidi left. She said that she could\r\nnot stand it very long, and therefore her father had promised to take\r\nher to Ragatz this coming fall. She announced that Grandmama was\r\ncoming too, for she wanted to see Heidi and her grandfather.\r\nGrandmama, having heard about the rolls, was sending some coffee, too,\r\nso that the grandmother would not have to eat them dry. Grandmama\r\nalso insisted on being taken to the grandmother herself when she came\r\non her visit.\r\n\r\nGreat was the delight caused by this news, and what with all the\r\nquestions and plans that followed, the grandfather himself forgot how\r\nlate it was. This happy day, which had united them all, caused the old\r\nwoman to say at parting: "The most beautiful thing of all, though, is\r\nto be able to shake hands again with an old friend, as in days gone\r\nby; it is a great comfort to find again, what we have treasured. I\r\nhope you\'ll come soon again, uncle. I am counting on the child for\r\ntomorrow."\r\n\r\nThis promise was given. While Heidi and her grandfather were on their\r\nhomeward path, the peaceful sound of evening bells accompanied them.\r\nAt last they reached the cottage, which seemed to glow in the evening\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nHeidi Makes Use of Her Experience\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR A JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kind doctor who had sent Heidi home to her beloved mountains was\r\napproaching the Sesemann residence on a sunny day in September.\r\nEverything about him was bright and cheerful, but the doctor did not\r\neven raise his eyes from the pavement to the blue sky above. His face\r\nwas sad and his hair had turned very gray since spring. A few months\r\nago the doctor had lost his only daughter, who had lived with him\r\nsince his wife\'s early death. The blooming girl had been his only joy,\r\nand since she had gone from him the ever-cheerful doctor was bowed\r\ndown with grief.\r\n\r\nWhen Sebastian opened the door to the physician he bowed very low, for\r\nthe doctor made friends wherever he went.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have come doctor," Mr. Sesemann called to his friend as\r\nhe entered. "Please let us talk over this trip to Switzerland again.\r\nDo you still give the same advice, now that Clara is so much better?"\r\n\r\n"What must I think of you, Sesemann?" replied the doctor, sitting\r\ndown. "I wish your mother was here. Everything is clear to her and\r\nthings go smoothly then. This is the third time to-day that you have\r\ncalled me, and always for the same thing!"\r\n\r\n"It is true, it must make you impatient," said Mr. Sesemann. Laying\r\nhis hand on his friend\'s shoulder, he continued: "I cannot say how\r\nhard it is for me to refuse Clara this trip. Haven\'t I promised it to\r\nher and hasn\'t she looked forward to it for months? She has borne all\r\nher suffering so patiently, just because she had hoped to be able to\r\nvisit her little friend on the Alp. I hate to rob her of this\r\npleasure. The poor child has so many trials and so little change."\r\n\r\n"But, Sesemann, you must do it," was the doctor\'s answer. When his\r\nfriend remained silent, he continued: "Just think what a hard summer\r\nClara has had! She never was more ill and we could not attempt this\r\njourney without risking the worst consequences. Remember, we are in\r\nSeptember now, and though the weather may still be fine on the Alp, it\r\nis sure to be very cool. The days are getting short, and she could\r\nonly spend a few hours up there, if she had to return for the night.\r\nIt would take several hours to have her carried up from Ragatz. You\r\nsee yourself how impossible it is! I shall come in with you, though,\r\nto talk to Clara, and you\'ll find her sensible. I\'ll tell you of my\r\nplan for next May. First she can go to Ragatz to take the baths. When\r\nit gets warm on the mountain, she can be carried up from time to time.\r\nShe\'ll be stronger then and much more able to enjoy those excursions\r\nthan she is now. If we hope for an improvement in her condition, we\r\nmust be extremely cautious and careful, remember that!"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann, who had been listening with the utmost submission, now\r\nsaid anxiously: "Doctor, please tell me honestly if you still have\r\nhope left for any change?"\r\n\r\nWith shrugging shoulders the doctor replied: "Not very much. But think\r\nof me, Sesemann! Have you not a child, who loves you and always\r\nwelcomes you? You don\'t have to come back to a lonely house and sit\r\ndown alone at your table. Your child is well taken care of, and if she\r\nhas many privations, she also has many advantages. Sesemann, you do\r\nnot need to be pitied! Just think of my lonely home!"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had gotten up and was walking round the room, as he\r\nalways did when something occupied his thoughts. Suddenly he stood\r\nbefore his friend and said: "Doctor, I have an idea. I cannot see you\r\nsad any longer. You must get away. You shall undertake this trip and\r\nvisit Heidi in our stead."\r\n\r\nThe doctor had been surprised by this proposal, and tried to object.\r\nBut Mr. Sesemann was so full of his new project that he pulled his\r\nfriend with him into his daughter\'s room, not leaving him time for any\r\nremonstrances. Clara loved the doctor, who had always tried to cheer\r\nher up on his visits by bright and funny tales. She was sorry for the\r\nchange that had come over him and would have given much to see him\r\nhappy again. When he had shaken hands with her, both men pulled up\r\ntheir chairs to Clara\'s bedside. Mr. Sesemann began to speak of their\r\njourney and how sorry he was to give it up. Then he quickly began to\r\ntalk of his new plan.\r\n\r\nClara\'s eyes had filled with tears. But she knew that her father did\r\nnot like to see her cry, and besides she was sure that her papa would\r\nonly forbid her this pleasure because it was absolutely necessary to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nSo she bravely fought her tears, and caressing the doctor\'s hand,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Oh please, doctor, do go to Heidi; then you can tell me all about\r\nher, and can describe her grandfather to me, and Peter, with his\r\ngoats,--I seem to know them all so well. Then you can take all the\r\nthings to her that I had planned to take myself. Oh, please doctor,\r\ngo, and then I\'ll be good and take as much cod-liver oil as ever you\r\nwant me to."\r\n\r\nWho can tell if this promise decided the doctor? At any rate he\r\nanswered with a smile: "Then I surely must go, Clara, for you will get\r\nfat and strong, as we both want to see you. Have you settled yet when\r\nI must go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you had better go tomorrow morning, doctor," Clara urged.\r\n\r\n"She is right," the father assented; "the sun is shining and you must\r\nnot lose any more glorious days on the Alp."\r\n\r\nThe doctor had to laugh. "Why don\'t you chide me for being here still?\r\nI shall go as quickly as I can, Sesemann."\r\n\r\nClara gave many messages to him for Heidi. She also told him to be\r\nsure to observe everything closely, so that he would be able to tell\r\nher all about it when he came back. The things for Heidi were to be\r\nsent to him later, for Miss Rottenmeier, who had to pack them, was out\r\non one of her lengthy wanderings about town.\r\n\r\nThe doctor promised to comply with all Clara\'s wishes and to start the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nClara rang for the maid and said to her, when she arrived: "Please,\r\nTinette, pack a lot of fresh, soft coffee-cake in this box." A box\r\nhad been ready for this purpose many days. When the maid was leaving\r\nthe room she murmured: "That\'s a silly bother!"\r\n\r\nSebastian, who had happened to overhear some remarks, asked the\r\nphysician when he was leaving to take his regards to the little Miss,\r\nas he called Heidi.\r\n\r\nWith a promise to deliver this message the doctor was just hastening\r\nout, when he encountered an obstacle. Miss Rottenmeier, who had been\r\nobliged to return from her walk on account of the strong wind, was\r\njust coming in. She wore a large cape, which the wind was blowing\r\nabout her like two full sails. Both had retreated politely to give way\r\nto each other. Suddenly the wind seemed to carry the housekeeper\r\nstraight towards the doctor, who had barely time to avoid her. This\r\nlittle incident, which had ruffled Miss Rottenmeier\'s temper very\r\nmuch, gave the doctor occasion to soothe her, as she liked to be\r\nsoothed by this man, whom she respected more than anybody in the\r\nworld. Telling her of his intended visit, he entreated her to pack the\r\nthings for Heidi as only she knew how.\r\n\r\nClara had expected some resistance from Miss Rottenmeier about the\r\npacking of her presents. What was her surprise when this lady showed\r\nherself most obliging, and immediately, on being told, brought\r\ntogether all the articles! First came a heavy coat for Heidi, with a\r\nhood, which Clara meant her to use on visits to the grandmother in the\r\nwinter. Then came a thick warm shawl and a large box with coffee-cake\r\nfor the grandmother. An enormous sausage for Peter\'s mother followed,\r\nand a little sack of tobacco for the grandfather. At last a lot of\r\nmysterious little parcels and boxes were packed, things that Clara had\r\ngathered together for Heidi. When the tidy pack lay ready on the\r\nground, Clara\'s heart filled with pleasure at the thought of her\r\nlittle friend\'s delight.\r\n\r\nSebastian now entered, and putting the pack on his shoulder, carried\r\nit to the doctor\'s house without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nA GUEST ON THE ALP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early dawn was tinging the mountains and a fresh morning-breeze\r\nrocked the old fir-trees to and fro. Heidi opened her eyes, for the\r\nrustling of the wind had awakened her. These sounds always thrilled\r\nher heart, and now they drew her out of bed. Rising hurriedly, she\r\nsoon was neatly dressed and combed.\r\n\r\nComing down the little ladder and finding the grandfather\'s bed empty,\r\nshe ran outside. The old man was looking up at the sky to see what the\r\nweather was going to be like that day. Rosy clouds were passing\r\noverhead, but gradually the sky grew more blue and deep, and soon a\r\ngolden light passed over the heights, for the sun was rising in all\r\nhis glory.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how lovely! Good-morning, grandfather," Heidi exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Are your eyes bright already?" the grandfather retorted, holding out\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nHeidi then ran over to her beloved fir-trees and danced about, while\r\nthe wind was howling in the branches.\r\n\r\nAfter the old man had washed and milked the goats, he brought them out\r\nof the shed. When Heidi saw her friends again, she caressed them\r\ntenderly, and they in their turn nearly crushed her between them.\r\nSometimes when Baerli got too wild, Heidi would say: "But Baerli, you\r\npush me like the Big Turk," and that was enough to quiet the goat.\r\n\r\nSoon Peter arrived with the whole herd, the jolly Thistlefinch ahead\r\nof all the others. Heidi, being soon in the mist of them, was pushed\r\nabout among them. Peter was anxious to say a word to the little girl,\r\nso he gave a shrill whistle, urging the goats to climb ahead. When he\r\nwas near her he said reproachfully: "You really might come with me\r\nto-day!"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t, Peter," said Heidi. "They might come from Frankfurt any\r\ntime. I must be home when they come."\r\n\r\n"How often you have said that," grumbled the boy.\r\n\r\n"But I mean it," replied Heidi. "Do you really think I want to be away\r\nwhen they come from Frankfurt? Do you really think that, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"They could come to uncle," Peter growled.\r\n\r\nThen the grandfather\'s strong voice was heard: "Why doesn\'t the army\r\ngo forward? Is it the field-marshal\'s fault, or the fault of the\r\ntroop?"\r\n\r\nPeter immediately turned about and led his goats up the mountain\r\nwithout more ado.\r\n\r\nSince Heidi had come home again to her grandfather she did many things\r\nthat had never occurred to her before. For instance, she would make\r\nher bed every morning, and run about the hut, tidying and dusting.\r\nWith an old rag she would rub the chairs and table till they all\r\nshone, and the grandfather would exclaim: "It is always Sunday with us\r\nnow; Heidi has not been away in vain."\r\n\r\nOn this day after breakfast, when Heidi began her self-imposed task,\r\nit took her longer than usual, for the weather was too glorious to\r\nstay within. Over and over again a bright sunbeam would tempt the busy\r\nchild outside. How could she stay indoors, when the glistening\r\nsunshine was pouring down and all the mountains seemed to glow? She\r\nhad to sit down on the dry, hard ground and look down into the valley\r\nand all about her. Then, suddenly remembering her little duties, she\r\nwould hasten back. It was not long, though, till the roaring fir-trees\r\ntempted her again. The grandfather had been busy in his little shop,\r\nmerely glancing over at the child from time to time. Suddenly he heard\r\nher call: "Oh grandfather, come!"\r\n\r\nHe was frightened and came out quickly He saw her running down the\r\nhill crying: "They are coming, they are coming. Oh, the doctor is\r\ncoming first."\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THEY ARE COMING, OH, THE DOCTOR IS COMING FIRST]\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi at last reached her old friend, he held out his hand, which\r\nHeidi immediately seized. In the full joy of her heart, she exclaimed:\r\n"How do you do, doctor? And I thank you a thousand times!"\r\n\r\n"How are you, Heidi? But what are you thanking me for already?" the\r\ndoctor asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Because you let me come home again," the child explained.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\'s face lit up like sunshine. He had certainly not\r\ncounted on such a reception on the Alp. On the contrary! Not even\r\nnoticing all the beauty around him, he had climbed up sadly, for he\r\nwas sure that Heidi probably would not know him any more. He thought\r\nthat he would be far from welcome, being obliged to cause her a great\r\ndisappointment. Instead, he beheld Heidi\'s bright eyes looking up at\r\nhim in gratefulness and love. She was still holding his arm, when he\r\nsaid: "Come now, Heidi, and take me to your grandfather, for I want\r\nto see where you live."\r\n\r\nLike a kind father he had taken her hand, but Heidi stood still and\r\nlooked down the mountain-side.\r\n\r\n"But where are Clara and grandmama?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Child, I must tell you something now which will grieve you as much as\r\nit grieves me," replied the doctor. "I had to come alone, for Clara\r\nhas been very ill and could not travel. Of course grandmama has not\r\ncome either; but the spring will soon be here, and when the days get\r\nlong and warm, they will surely visit you."\r\n\r\nHeidi was perfectly amazed; she could not understand how all those\r\nthings that she had pictured to herself so clearly would not happen\r\nafter all. She was standing perfectly motionless, confused by the\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Heidi remembered that, after all, she had come\r\ndown to meet the doctor. Looking up at her friend, she was struck by\r\nhis sad and cheerless face. How changed he was since she had seen\r\nhim! She did not like to see people unhappy, least of all the good,\r\nkind doctor. He must be sad because Clara and grandmama had not come,\r\nand to console him she said: "Oh, it won\'t last long till spring comes\r\nagain; then they will come for sure; they\'ll be able to stay much\r\nlonger then, and that will please Clara. Now we\'ll go to grandfather."\r\n\r\nHand in hand she climbed up with her old friend. All the way she tried\r\nto cheer him up by telling him again and again of the coming summer\r\ndays. After they had reached the cottage, she called out to her\r\ngrandfather quite happily:\r\n\r\n"They are not here yet, but it won\'t be very long before they are\r\ncoming!"\r\n\r\nThe grandfather warmly welcomed his guest, who did not seem at all a\r\nstranger, for had not Heidi told him many things about the doctor?\r\nThey all three sat down on the bench before the door, and the doctor\r\ntold of the object of his visit. He whispered to the child that\r\nsomething was coming up the mountain very soon which would bring her\r\nmore pleasure than his visit. What could it be?\r\n\r\nThe uncle advised the doctor to spend the splendid days of autumn on\r\nthe Alp, if possible, and to take a little room in the village instead\r\nof in Ragatz; then he could easily walk up every day to the hut, and\r\nfrom there the uncle could take him all around the mountains. This\r\nplan was accepted.\r\n\r\nThe sun was in its zenith and the wind had ceased. Only a soft\r\ndelicious breeze fanned the cheeks of all.\r\n\r\nThe uncle now got up and went into the hut, returning soon with a\r\ntable and their dinner.\r\n\r\n"Go in, Heidi, and set the table here. I hope you will excuse our\r\nsimple meal," he said, turning to his guest.\r\n\r\n"I shall gladly accept this delightful invitation; I am sure that\r\ndinner will taste good up here," said the guest, looking down over the\r\nsun-bathed valley.\r\n\r\nHeidi was running to and fro, for it gave her great joy to be able to\r\nwait on her kind protector. Soon the uncle appeared with the steaming\r\nmilk, the toasted cheese, and the finely-sliced, rosy meat that had\r\nbeen dried in the pure air. The doctor enjoyed his dinner better than\r\nany he had ever tasted.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must send Clara up here. How she could gather strength!" he\r\nsaid; "If she would have an appetite like mine to-day, she couldn\'t\r\nhelp getting nice and fat."\r\n\r\nAt this moment a man could be seen walking up with a large sack on his\r\nshoulders. Arriving on top, he threw down his load, breathing in the\r\npure, fresh air.\r\n\r\nOpening the cover, the doctor said: "This has come for you from\r\nFrankfurt, Heidi. Come and look what is in it."\r\n\r\nHeidi timidly watched the heap, and only when the gentleman opened the\r\nbox with the cakes for the grandmother she said joyfully: "Oh, now\r\ngrandmother can eat this lovely cake." She was taking the box and the\r\nbeautiful shawl on her arm and was going to race down to deliver the\r\ngifts, when the men persuaded her to stay and unpack the rest. What\r\nwas her delight at finding the tobacco and all the other things. The\r\nmen had been talking together, when the child suddenly planted herself\r\nin front of them and said: "These things have not given me as much\r\npleasure as the dear doctor\'s coming." Both men smiled.\r\n\r\nWhen it was near sunset, the doctor rose to start on his way down. The\r\ngrandfather, carrying the box, the shawl and the sausage, and the\r\nguest holding the little girl by the hand, they wandered down the\r\nmountain-side. When they reached Peter\'s hut, Heidi was told to go\r\ninside and wait for her grandfather there. At parting she asked:\r\n"Would you like to come with me up to the pasture to-morrow, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"With pleasure. Good-bye, Heidi," was the reply. The grandfather had\r\ndeposited all the presents before the door, and it took Heidi long to\r\ncarry in the huge box and the sausage. The shawl she put on the\r\ngrandmother\'s knee.\r\n\r\nBrigida had silently watched the proceedings, and could not open her\r\neyes wide enough when she saw the enormous sausage. Never in her life\r\nhad she seen the like, and now she really possessed it and could cut\r\nit herself.\r\n\r\n"Oh grandmother, don\'t the cakes please you awfully? Just look how\r\nsoft they are!" the child exclaimed. What was her amazement when she\r\nsaw the grandmother more pleased with the shawl, which would keep her\r\nwarm in winter.\r\n\r\n"Grandmother, Clara has sent you that," Heidi said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what kind good people they are to think of a poor old woman like\r\nme! I never thought I should ever own such a splendid wrap."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Peter came stumbling in.\r\n\r\n"The uncle is coming up behind me, and Heidi must--" that was as far\r\nas he got, for his eyes had fastened on the sausage. Heidi, however,\r\nhad already said good-bye, for she knew what he had meant. Though her\r\nuncle never went by the hut any more without stepping in, she knew it\r\nwas too late to-day. "Heidi, come, you must get your sleep," he called\r\nthrough the open door. Bidding them all good-night, he took Heidi by\r\nthe hand and under the glistening stars they wandered home to their\r\npeaceful cottage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nRETALIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the doctor climbed up the mountain in company\r\nwith Peter and his goats. The friendly gentleman made several attempts\r\nto start a conversation with the boy, but as answer to his questions\r\nhe got nothing more than monosyllables. When they arrived on top, they\r\nfound Heidi already waiting, fresh and rosy as the early dawn.\r\n\r\n"Are you coming?" asked Peter as usual.\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall, if the doctor comes with us," replied the child.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather, coming out of the hut, greeted the newcomer with\r\ngreat respect. Then he went up to Peter, and hung on his shoulder the\r\nsack, which seemed to contain more than usual that day.\r\n\r\nWhen they had started on their way, Heidi kept urging forward the\r\ngoats, which were crowding about her. When at last she was walking\r\npeacefully by the doctor\'s side, she began to relate to him many\r\nthings about the goats and all their strange pranks, and about the\r\nflowers, rocks and birds they saw. When they arrived at their\r\ndestination, time seemed to have flown. Peter all the time was sending\r\nmany an angry glance at the unconscious doctor, who never even noticed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHeidi now took the doctor to her favorite spot. From there they could\r\nhear the peaceful-sounding bells of the grazing cattle below. The sky\r\nwas deep blue, and above their heads the eagle was circling with\r\noutstretched wings. Everything was luminous and bright about them, but\r\nthe doctor had been silent. Suddenly looking up, he beheld Heidi\'s\r\nradiant eyes.\r\n\r\n"Heidi, it is beautiful up here," he said. "But how can anybody with a\r\nheavy heart enjoy the beauty? Tell me!"\r\n\r\n"Oh," exclaimed Heidi, "one never has a sad heart here. One only gets\r\nunhappy in Frankfurt."\r\n\r\nA faint smile passed over the doctor\'s face. Then he began: "But if\r\nsomebody has brought his sorrow away with him, how would you comfort\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"God in Heaven alone can help him."\r\n\r\n"That is true, child," remarked the doctor. "But what can we do when\r\nGod Himself has sent us the affliction?"\r\n\r\nAfter meditating a moment, Heidi replied: "One must wait patiently,\r\nfor God knows how to turn the saddest things to something happy in the\r\nend. God will show us what He has meant to do for us. But He will only\r\ndo so if we pray to Him patiently."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will always keep this beautiful belief, Heidi," said the\r\ndoctor. Then looking up at the mighty cliffs above, he continued:\r\n"Think how sad it would make us not to be able to see all these\r\nbeautiful things. Wouldn\'t that make us doubly sad? Can you understand\r\nme, child?"\r\n\r\nA great pain shot through Heidi\'s breast. She had to think of the poor\r\ngrandmother. Her blindness was always a great sorrow to the child, and\r\nshe had been struck with it anew. Seriously she replied:\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I can understand it. But then we can read grandmother\'s\r\nsongs; they make us happy and bright again."\r\n\r\n"Which songs, Heidi?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, those of the sun, and of the beautiful garden, and then the last\r\nverses of the long one. Grandmother loves them so that I always have\r\nto read them over three times," said Heidi.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would say them to me, child, for I should like to hear\r\nthem," said the doctor.\r\n\r\nHeidi, folding her hands, began the consoling verses. She stopped\r\nsuddenly, however, for the doctor did not seem to listen. He was\r\nsitting motionless, holding his hand before his eyes. Thinking that he\r\nhad fallen asleep, she remained silent. But the verses had recalled\r\nhis childhood days; he seemed to hear his mother and see her loving\r\neyes, for when he was a little boy she had sung this song to him. A\r\nlong time he sat there, till he discovered that Heidi was watching\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Heidi, your song was lovely," he said with a more joyful voice. "We\r\nmust come here another day and then you can recite it to me again."\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Peter had been boiling with anger. Now that Heidi\r\nhad come again to the pasture with him, she did nothing but talk to\r\nthe old gentleman. It made him very cross that he was not even able to\r\nget near her. Standing a little distance behind Heidi\'s friend, he\r\nshook his fist at him, and soon afterwards both fists, finally raising\r\nthem up to the sky, as Heidi and the doctor remained together.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun stood in its zenith and Peter knew that it was noon, he\r\ncalled over to them with all his might: "Time to eat."\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi was getting up to fetch their dinner, the doctor just asked\r\nfor a glass of milk, which was all he wanted. The child also decided\r\nto make the milk her sole repast, running over to Peter and informing\r\nhim of their resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy found that the whole contents of the bag was his, he\r\nhurried with his task as never in his life before. But he felt guilty\r\non account of his former anger at the kind gentleman. To show his\r\nrepentance he held his hands up flat to the sky, indicating by his\r\naction that his fists did not mean anything any more. Only after that\r\ndid he start with his feast.\r\n\r\nHeidi and the doctor had wandered about the pasture till the gentleman\r\nhad found it time to go. He wanted Heidi to remain where she was, but\r\nshe insisted on accompanying him. All the way down she showed him many\r\nplaces where the pretty mountain flowers grew, all of whose names she\r\ncould tell him. When they parted at last, Heidi waved to him. From\r\ntime to time he turned about, and seeing the child still standing\r\nthere, he had to think of his own little daughter who used to wave to\r\nhim like that when he went away from home.\r\n\r\nThe weather was warm and sunny that month. Every morning the doctor\r\ncame up to the Alp, spending his day very often with the old man. Many\r\na climb they had together that took them far up, to the bare cliffs\r\nnear the eagle\'s haunt. The uncle would show his guest all the herbs\r\nthat grew on hidden places and were strengthening and healing. He\r\ncould tell many strange things of the beasts that lived in holes in\r\nrock or earth, or in the high tops of trees.\r\n\r\nIn the evening they would part, and the doctor would exclaim: "My dear\r\nfriend, I never leave you without having learned something."\r\n\r\nBut most of his days he spent with Heidi. Then the two would sit\r\ntogether on the child\'s favorite spot, and Peter, quite subdued,\r\nbehind them. Heidi had to recite the verses, as she had done the first\r\nday, and entertain him with all the things she knew.\r\n\r\nAt last the beautiful month of September was over. One morning the\r\ndoctor came up with a sadder face than usual. The time had come for\r\nhim to go back to Frankfurt, and great was the uncle\'s sadness at that\r\nnews. Heidi herself could hardly realize that her loving friend, whom\r\nshe had been seeing every day, was really leaving. The doctor himself\r\nwas loath to go, for the Alp had become as a home to him. But it was\r\nnecessary for him to go, and shaking hands with the grandfather, he\r\nsaid good-bye, Heidi going along with him a little way.\r\n\r\nHand in hand they wandered down, till the doctor stood still. Then\r\ncaressing Heidi\'s curly hair, he said: "Now I must go, Heidi! I wish I\r\ncould take you along with me to Frankfurt; then I could keep you."\r\n\r\nAt those words, all the rows and rows of houses and streets, Miss\r\nRottenmeier and Tinette rose before Heidi\'s eyes. Hesitating a little,\r\nshe said: "I should like it better if you would come to see us again."\r\n\r\n"I believe that will be better. Now farewell!" said the friendly\r\ngentleman. When they shook hands his eyes filled with tears. Turning\r\nquickly he hurried off.\r\n\r\nHeidi, standing on the same spot, looked after him. What kind eyes he\r\nhad! But they had been full of tears. All of a sudden she began to cry\r\nbitterly, and ran after her friend, calling with all her might, but\r\ninterrupted by her sobs:\r\n\r\n"Oh doctor, doctor!"\r\n\r\nLooking round he stood still and waited till the child had reached\r\nhim. Her tears came rolling down her cheeks while she sobbed: "I\'ll\r\ncome with you to Frankfurt and I\'ll stay as long as ever you want me\r\nto. But first I must see grandfather."\r\n\r\n"No, no, dear child," he said affectionately, "not at once. You must\r\nremain here, I don\'t want you to get ill again. But if I should get\r\nsick and lonely and ask you to come to me, would you come and stay\r\nwith me? Can I go away and think that somebody in this world still\r\ncares for me and loves me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall come to you the same day, for I really love you as much\r\nas grandfather," Heidi assured him, crying all the time.\r\n\r\nShaking hands again, they parted. Heidi stayed on the same spot,\r\nwaving her hand and looking after her departing friend till he seemed\r\nno bigger than a little dot. Then he looked back a last time at Heidi\r\nand the sunny Alp, muttering to himself: "It is beautiful up there.\r\nBody and soul get strengthened in that place and life seems worth\r\nliving again."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nWINTER IN THE VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe snow lay so deep around the Alm-hut that the windows seemed to\r\nstand level with the ground and the house-door had entirely\r\ndisappeared. Round Peter\'s hut it was the same. When the boy went out\r\nto shovel the snow, he had to creep through the window; then he would\r\nsink deep into the soft snow and kick with arms and legs to get free.\r\nTaking a broom, the boy would have to clear away the snow from the\r\ndoor to prevent its falling into the hut.\r\n\r\nThe uncle had kept his word; when the first snow had fallen, he had\r\nmoved down to the village with Heidi and his goats. Near the church\r\nand the parish house lay an old ruin that once had been a spacious\r\nbuilding. A brave soldier had lived there in days gone by; he had\r\nfought in the Spanish war, and coming back with many riches, had\r\nbuilt himself a splendid house. But having lived too long in the noisy\r\nworld to be able to stand the monotonous life in the little town, he\r\nsoon went away, never to come back. After his death, many years later,\r\nthough the house was already beginning to decay, a distant relation of\r\nhis took possession of it. The new proprietor did not want to build it\r\nup again, so poor people moved in. They had to pay little rent for the\r\nhouse, which was gradually crumbling and falling to pieces. Years ago,\r\nwhen the uncle had come to the village with Tobias, he had lived\r\nthere. Most of the time it had been empty, for the winter lasted long,\r\nand cold winds would blow through the chinks in the walls. When poor\r\npeople lived there, their candles would be blown out and they would\r\nshiver with cold in the dark. But the uncle, had known how to help\r\nhimself. In the fall, as soon as he had resolved to live in the\r\nvillage, he came down frequently, fitting up the place as best he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the house from the back, one entered an open room,\r\nwhere nearly all the walls lay in ruins. On one side the remains of a\r\nchapel could be seen, now covered with the thickest ivy. A large hall\r\ncame next, with a beautiful stone floor and grass growing in the\r\ncrevices. Most of the walls were gone and part of the ceiling also. If\r\na few thick pillars had not been left supporting the rest, it would\r\nundoubtedly have tumbled down. The uncle had made a wooden partition\r\nhere for the goats, and covered the floor with straw. Several\r\ncorridors, most of them half decayed, led finally to a chamber with a\r\nheavy iron door. This room was still in good condition and had dark\r\nwood panelling on the four firm walls. In one corner was an enormous\r\nstove, which nearly reached up to the ceiling. On the white tiles were\r\npainted blue pictures of old towers surrounded by high trees, and of\r\nhunters with their hounds. There also was a scene with a quiet lake,\r\nwhere, under shady oak-trees, a fisherman was sitting. Around the\r\nstove a bench was placed. Heidi loved to sit there, and as soon as she\r\nhad entered their new abode, she began to examine the pictures.\r\nArriving at the end of the bench, she discovered a bed, which was\r\nplaced between the wall and the stove. "Oh grandfather, I have found\r\nmy bed-room," exclaimed the little girl. "Oh, how fine it is! Where\r\nare you going to sleep?"\r\n\r\n"Your bed must be near the stove, to keep you warm," said the old man.\r\n"Now come and look at mine."\r\n\r\nWith that the grandfather led her into his bed-room. From there a door\r\nled into the hugest kitchen Heidi had ever seen. With a great deal of\r\ntrouble the grandfather had fitted up this place. Many boards were\r\nnailed across the walls and the door had been fastened with heavy\r\nwires, for beyond, the building lay in ruins. Thick underbrush was\r\ngrowing there, sheltering thousands of insects and lizards. Heidi was\r\ndelighted with her new home, and when Peter arrived next day, she did\r\nnot rest till he had seen every nook and corner of the curious\r\ndwelling-place.\r\n\r\nHeidi slept very well in her chimney corner, but it took her many days\r\nto get accustomed to it. When she woke up in the morning and could not\r\nhear the fir-trees roar, she would wonder where she was. Was the snow\r\ntoo heavy on the branches? Was she away from home? But as soon as she\r\nheard her grandfather\'s voice outside, she remembered everything and\r\nwould jump merrily out of bed.\r\n\r\nAfter four days had gone by, Heidi said to her grandfather: "I must go\r\nto grandmother now, she has been alone so many days."\r\n\r\nBut the grandfather shook his head and said: "You can\'t go yet, child.\r\nThe snow is fathoms deep up there and is still falling. Peter can\r\nhardly get through. A little girl like you would be snowed up and lost\r\nin no time. Wait a while till it freezes and then you can walk on top\r\nof the crust."\r\n\r\nHeidi was very sorry, but she was so busy now that the days flew by.\r\nEvery morning and afternoon she went to school, eagerly learning\r\nwhatever was taught her. She hardly ever saw Peter there, for he did\r\nnot come very often. The mild teacher would only say from time to\r\ntime: "It seems to me, Peter is not here again! School would do him\r\ngood, but I guess there is too much snow for him to get through." But\r\nwhen Heidi came home towards evening, Peter generally paid her a\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days the sun came out for a short time at noon, and the\r\nnext morning the whole Alp glistened and shone like crystal. When\r\nPeter was jumping as usual into the snow that morning, he fell against\r\nsomething hard, and before he could stop himself he flew a little way\r\ndown the mountain. When he had gained his feet at last, he stamped\r\nupon the ground with all his might. It really was frozen as hard as\r\nstone. Peter could hardly believe it, and quickly running up and\r\nswallowing his milk, and putting his bread in his pocket, he\r\nannounced: "I must go to school to-day!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, go and learn nicely," answered his mother.\r\n\r\nThen, sitting down on his sled, the boy coasted down the mountain like\r\na shot. Not being able to stop his course when he reached the village,\r\nhe coasted down further and further, till he arrived in the plain,\r\nwhere the sled stopped of itself. It was already late for school, so\r\nthe boy took his time and only arrived in the village when Heidi came\r\nhome for dinner.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got it!" announced the boy, on entering.\r\n\r\n"What, general?" asked the uncle.\r\n\r\n"The snow," Peter replied.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now I can go up to grandmother!" Heidi rejoiced. "But Peter, why\r\ndidn\'t you come to school? You could coast down to-day," she continued\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n"I went too far on my sled and then it was too late," Peter replied.\r\n\r\n"I call that deserting!" said the uncle. "People who do that must\r\nhave their ears pulled; do you hear?"\r\n\r\nThe boy was frightened, for there was no one in the world whom he\r\nrespected more than the uncle.\r\n\r\n"A general like you ought to be doubly ashamed to do so," the uncle\r\nwent on. "What would you do with the goats if they did not obey you\r\nany more?"\r\n\r\n"Beat them," was the reply.\r\n\r\n"If you knew of a boy that was behaving like a disobedient goat and\r\nhad to get spanked, what would you say?"\r\n\r\n"Serves him right."\r\n\r\n"So now you know it, goat-general: if you miss school again, when you\r\nought to be there, you can come to me and get your due."\r\n\r\nNow at last Peter understood what the uncle had meant. More kindly,\r\nthe old man then turned to Peter and said, "Come to the table now and\r\neat with us. Then you can go up with Heidi, and when you bring her\r\nback at night, you can get your supper here."\r\n\r\nThis unexpected change delighted Peter. Not losing any time, he soon\r\ndisposed of his full plate. Heidi, who had given the boy most of her\r\ndinner, was already putting on Clara\'s new coat. Then together they\r\nclimbed up, Heidi chatting all the time. But Peter did not say a\r\nsingle word. He was preoccupied and had not even listened to Heidi\'s\r\ntales. Before they entered the hut, the boy said stubbornly: "I think\r\nI had rather go to school than get a beating from the uncle." Heidi\r\npromptly confirmed him in his resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen they went into the room, Peter\'s mother was alone at the table\r\nmending. The grandmother was nowhere to be seen. Brigida now told\r\nHeidi that the grandmother was obliged to stay in bed on those cold\r\ndays, as she did not feel very strong. That was something new for\r\nHeidi. Quickly running to the old woman\'s chamber, she found her lying\r\nin a narrow bed, wrapped up in her grey shawl and thin blanket.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" the grandmother exclaimed when she heard her\r\ndarling\'s step. All autumn and winter long a secret fear had been\r\ngnawing at her heart, that Heidi would be sent for by the strange\r\ngentleman of whom Peter had told her so much. Heidi had approached the\r\nbed, asking anxiously: "Are you very sick, grandmother?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, child," the old woman reassured her, "the frost has just gone\r\ninto my limbs a little."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to be well again as soon as the warm weather comes?"\r\ninquired Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, and if God wills, even sooner. I want to go back to my\r\nspinning-wheel and I nearly tried it to-day. I\'ll get up to-morrow,\r\nthough," the grandmother said confidently, for she had noticed how\r\nfrightened Heidi was.\r\n\r\nThe last speech made the child feel more happy. Then, looking\r\nwonderingly at the grandmother, she said: "In Frankfurt people put on\r\na shawl when they go out. Why are you putting it on in bed,\r\ngrandmother?"\r\n\r\n"I put it on to keep me warm, Heidi. I am glad to have it, for my\r\nblanket is very thin."\r\n\r\n"But, grandmother, your bed is slanting down at your head, where it\r\nought to be high. No bed ought to be like that."\r\n\r\n"I know, child, I can feel it well." So saying, the old woman tried to\r\nchange her position on the pillow that lay under her like a thin\r\nboard. "My pillow never was very thick, and sleeping on it all these\r\nyears has made it flat."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, if I had only asked Clara to give me the bed I had in\r\nFrankfurt!" Heidi lamented. "It had three big pillows on it; I could\r\nhardly sleep because I kept sliding down from them all the time. Could\r\nyou sleep with them, grandmother?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, because that would keep me warm. I could breathe so much\r\neasier, too," said the grandmother, trying to find a higher place to\r\nlie on. "But I must not talk about it any more, for I have to be\r\nthankful for many things. I get the lovely roll every day and have\r\nthis beautiful warm shawl. I also have you, my child! Heidi, wouldn\'t\r\nyou like to read me something to-day?"\r\n\r\nHeidi immediately fetched the book and read one song after another.\r\nThe grandmother in the meantime was lying with folded hands; her face,\r\nwhich had been so sad a short time ago, was lit up with a happy smile.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Heidi stopped.\r\n\r\n"Are you well again, grandmother?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I feel very much better, Heidi. Please finish the song, will you?"\r\n\r\nThe child obeyed, and when she came to the last words,\r\n\r\n    When mine eyes grow dim and sad,\r\n      Let Thy love more brightly burn,\r\n    That my soul, a wanderer glad,\r\n      Safely homeward may return.\r\n\r\n"Safely homeward may return!" she exclaimed: "Oh, grandmother, I know\r\nwhat it is like to come home." After a while she said: "It is getting\r\ndark, grandmother, I must go home now. I am glad that you feel\r\nbetter again."\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE TWO CHILDREN WERE ALREADY FLYING DOWN THE ALP]\r\n\r\nThe grandmother, holding the child\'s hand in hers, said: "Yes, I am\r\nhappy again, though I have to stay in bed. Nobody knows how hard it is\r\nto lie here alone, day after day. I do not hear a word from anybody\r\nand cannot see a ray of sunlight. I have very sad thoughts sometimes,\r\nand often I feel as if I could not bear it any longer. But when I can\r\nhear those blessed songs that you have read to me, it makes me feel as\r\nif a light was shining into my heart, giving me the purest joy."\r\n\r\nShaking hands, the child now said good-night, and pulling Peter with\r\nher, ran outside. The brilliant moon was shining down on the white\r\nsnow, light as day. The two children were already flying down the Alp,\r\nlike birds soaring through the air.\r\n\r\nAfter Heidi had gone to bed that night, she lay awake a little while,\r\nthinking over everything the grandmother had said, especially about\r\nthe joy the songs had given her. If only poor grandmother could hear\r\nthose comforting words every day! Heidi knew that it might be a week\r\nor two again before she could repeat her visit. The child became very\r\nsad when she thought how uncomfortable and lonely the old woman would\r\nbe. Was there no way for help? Suddenly Heidi had an idea, and it\r\nthrilled her so that she felt as if she could not wait till morning\r\ncame to put her plan in execution. But in her excitement she had\r\nforgotten her evening prayer, so sitting up in bed, she prayed\r\nfervently to God. Then, falling back into the fragrant hay, she soon\r\nslept peacefully and soundly still the bright morning came.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nWINTER STILL CONTINUES\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter arrived punctually at school next day. He had brought his lunch\r\nwith him in a bag, for all the children that came from far away ate in\r\nschool, while the others went home. In the evening Peter as usual paid\r\nhis visit to Heidi.\r\n\r\nThe minute he opened the door she ran up to him, saying: "Peter, I\r\nhave to tell you something."\r\n\r\n"Say it," he replied.\r\n\r\n"You must learn to read now," said the child.\r\n\r\n"I have done it already."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, Peter, but I don\'t mean it that way," Heidi eagerly\r\nproceeded; "you must learn so that you really know how afterwards."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," Peter remarked.\r\n\r\n"Nobody believes you about that any more, and I won\'t either," Heidi\r\nsaid resolutely. "When I was in Frankfurt, grandmama told me that it\r\nwasn\'t true and that I shouldn\'t believe you."\r\n\r\nPeter\'s astonishment was great.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll teach you, for I know how; when you have learnt it, you must\r\nread one or two songs to grandmother every day."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t!" grumbled the boy.\r\n\r\nThis obstinate refusal made Heidi very angry. With flaming eyes she\r\nplanted herself before the boy and said: "I\'ll tell you what will\r\nhappen, if you don\'t want to learn. Your mother has often said that\r\nshe\'ll send you to Frankfurt. Clara showed me the terrible, large\r\nboys\' school there, where you\'ll have to go. You must stay there till\r\nyou are a man, Peter! You mustn\'t think that there is only one teacher\r\nthere, and such a kind one as we have here. No, indeed! There are\r\nwhole rows of them, and when they are out walking they have high\r\nblack hats on their heads. I saw them myself, when I was out driving!"\r\n\r\nCold shivers ran down Peter\'s back.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ll have to go there, and when they find out that you can\'t\r\nread or even spell, they\'ll laugh at you!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it," said Peter, half angry and half frightened.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am glad. Let us start right away!" said Heidi joyfully, pulling\r\nPeter over to the table. Among the things that Clara had sent, Heidi\r\nhad found a little book with the A,B,C and some rhymes. She had chosen\r\nthis for the lessons. Peter, having to spell the first rhyme, found\r\ngreat difficulty, so Heidi said, "I\'ll read it to you, and then you\'ll\r\nbe able to do it better. Listen:\r\n\r\n    "If A, B, C you do not know,\r\n    Before the school board you must go."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go," said Peter stubbornly.\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Before the court."\r\n\r\n"Hurry up and learn the three letters, then you won\'t have to!"\r\n\r\nPeter, beginning again, repeated the three letters till Heidi said:\r\n\r\n"Now you know them."\r\n\r\nHaving observed the good result of the first rhyme, she began to read\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n    D, E, F you then must read,\r\n    Or of misfortune take good heed!\r\n\r\n    Who over L and M doth stumble,\r\n    Must pay a penance and feel humble.\r\n\r\n    There\'s trouble coming; if you knew,\r\n    You\'d quickly learn N, O, P, Q.\r\n\r\n    If still you halt on R, S, T,\r\n    You\'ll suffer for it speedily.\r\n\r\nHeidi, stopping, looked at Peter, who was so frightened by all these\r\nthreats and mysterious horrors that he sat as still as a mouse.\r\nHeidi\'s tender heart was touched, and she said comfortingly: "Don\'t be\r\nafraid, Peter; if you come to me every day, you\'ll soon learn all the\r\nletters and then those things won\'t happen. But come every day, even\r\nwhen it snows. Promise!"\r\n\r\nPeter did so, and departed. Obeying Heidi\'s instructions, he came\r\ndaily to her for his lesson.\r\n\r\nSometimes the grandfather would sit in the room, smoking his pipe;\r\noften the corners of his mouth would twitch as if he could hardly keep\r\nfrom laughing.\r\n\r\nHe generally invited Peter to stay to supper afterwards, which\r\nliberally rewarded the boy for all his great exertions.\r\n\r\nThus the days passed by. In all this time Peter had really made some\r\nprogress, though the rhymes still gave him difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen they had come to U, Heidi read:\r\n\r\n    Whoever mixes U and V,\r\n    Will go where he won\'t want to be!\r\n\r\nand further,\r\n\r\n    If W you still ignore,\r\n    Look at the rod beside the door.\r\n\r\nOften Peter would growl and object to those measures, but nevertheless\r\nhe kept on learning, and soon had but three letters left.\r\n\r\nThe next few days the following rhymes, with their threats, made Peter\r\nmore eager than ever.\r\n\r\n      If you the letter X forget\r\n      For you no supper will be set.\r\n\r\n    If you still hesitate with Y,\r\n    For shame you\'ll run away and cry.\r\n\r\nWhen Heidi read the last,\r\n\r\n    And he who makes his Z with blots,\r\n    Must journey to the Hottentots,\r\n\r\nPeter sneered: "Nobody even knows where they are!"\r\n\r\n"I am sure grandfather does," Heidi retorted, jumping up. "Just wait\r\none minute and I shall ask him. He is over with the parson," and with\r\nthat she had opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Wait!" shrieked Peter in great alarm, for he saw himself already\r\ntransported to those dreadful people. "What is the matter with you?"\r\nsaid Heidi, standing still.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, but stay here. I\'ll learn," he blubbered. But Heidi,\r\nwanting to know something about the Hottentots herself, could only be\r\nkept back by piteous screams from Peter. So at last they settled down\r\nagain, and before it was time to go, Peter knew the last letter, and\r\nhad even begun to read syllables. From this day on he progressed more\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nIt was three weeks since Heidi had paid her last visit to the\r\ngrandmother, for much snow had fallen since. One evening, Peter,\r\ncoming home, said triumphantly:\r\n\r\n"I can do it!"\r\n\r\n"What is it you can do, Peter?" asked his mother, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Read."\r\n\r\n"What, is it possible? Did you hear it, grandmother?" exclaimed\r\nBrigida.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother also was curious to learn how this had happened.\r\n\r\n"I must read a song now; Heidi told me to," Peter continued. To the\r\nwomen\'s amazement, Peter began. After every verse his mother would\r\nexclaim, "Who would have ever thought it!" while the grandmother\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nOne day later, when it happened that it was Peter\'s turn to read in\r\nschool, the teacher said:\r\n\r\n"Peter, must I pass you by again, as usual? Or do you want to try--I\r\nshall not say to read, but to stammer through a line?"\r\n\r\nPeter began and read three lines without stopping.\r\n\r\nIn dumb astonishment, the teacher, putting down his book, looked at\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n"What miracle has happened to you?" he exclaimed. "For a long time I\r\ntried to teach you with all my patience, and you were not even able to\r\ngrasp the letters, but now that I had given you up as hopeless, you\r\nhave not only learnt how to spell, but even to read. How did this\r\nhappen, Peter?"\r\n\r\n"It was Heidi," the boy replied.\r\n\r\nIn great amazement, the teacher looked at the little girl. Then the\r\nkind man continued:\r\n\r\n"I have noticed a great change in you, Peter. You used to stay away\r\nfrom school, sometimes more than a week, and lately you have not even\r\nmissed a day. Who has brought about this change?"\r\n\r\n"The uncle."\r\n\r\nEvery evening now Peter on his return home read one song to his\r\ngrandmother, but never more. To the frequent praises of Brigida, the\r\nold woman once replied: "I am glad he has learnt something, but\r\nnevertheless I am longing for the spring to come. Then Heidi can visit\r\nme, for when she reads, the verses sound so different. I cannot always\r\nfollow Peter, and the songs don\'t thrill me the way they do when Heidi\r\nsays them!"\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder! For Peter would often leave out long and difficult\r\nwords,--what did three or four words matter! So it happened sometimes\r\nthat there were hardly any nouns left in the hymns that Peter read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nNEWS FROM DISTANT FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nMay had come. Warm sunshine was bathing the whole Alp in glorious\r\nlight, and having melted the last snow, had brought the first spring\r\nflowers to the surface. A merry spring wind was blowing, drying up the\r\ndamp places in the shadow. High above in the azure heaven the eagle\r\nfloated peacefully.\r\n\r\nHeidi and her grandfather were back on the Alp. The child was so happy\r\nto be home again that she jumped about among the beloved objects. Here\r\nshe discovered a new spring bud, and there she watched the gay little\r\ngnats and beetles that were swarming in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather was busy in his little shop, and a sound of hammering\r\nand sawing could be heard. Heidi had to go and see what the\r\ngrandfather was making. There before the door stood a neat new chair,\r\nwhile the old man was busy making a second.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what they are for," said Heidi gaily. "You are making them\r\nfor Clara and grandmama. Oh, but we need a third--or do you think that\r\nMiss Rottenmeier won\'t come, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know," said grandfather: "but it is safer to have a\r\nchair for her, if she should come."\r\n\r\nHeidi, thoughtfully looking at the backless chairs, remarked:\r\n"Grandfather, I don\'t think she would sit down on those."\r\n\r\n"Then we must invite her to sit down on the beautiful green lounge of\r\ngrass," quietly answered the old man.\r\n\r\nWhile Heidi was still wondering what the grandfather had meant, Peter\r\narrived, whistling and calling. As usual, Heidi was soon surrounded by\r\nthe goats, who also seemed happy to be back on the Alp. Peter, angrily\r\npushing the goats aside, marched up to Heidi, thrusting a letter into\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Did you get a letter for me on the pasture?" Heidi said, astonished.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Where did it come from?"\r\n\r\n"From my bag."\r\n\r\nThe letter had been given to Peter the previous evening; putting it in\r\nhis lunch-bag, the boy had forgotten it there till he opened the bag\r\nfor his dinner. Heidi immediately recognized Clara\'s handwriting, and\r\nbounding over to her grandfather, exclaimed: "A letter has come from\r\nClara. Wouldn\'t you like me to read it to you, grandfather?"\r\n\r\nHeidi immediately read to her two listeners, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    DEAR HEIDI:--\r\n\r\n    We are all packed up and shall travel in two or three days. Papa\r\n    is leaving, too, but not with us, for he has to go to Paris\r\n    first. The dear doctor visits us now every day, and as soon as\r\n    he opens the door, he calls, \'Away to the Alp!\' for he can\r\n    hardly wait for us to go. If you only knew how he enjoyed being\r\n    with you last fall! He came nearly every day this winter to tell\r\n    us all about you and the grandfather and the mountains and the\r\n    flowers he saw. He said that it was so quiet in the pure,\r\n    delicious air, away from towns and streets, that everybody has\r\n    to get well there. He is much better himself since his visit,\r\n    and seems younger and happier. Oh, how I look forward to it all!\r\n    The doctor\'s advice is, that I shall go to Ragatz first for\r\n    about six weeks, then I can go to live in the village, and from\r\n    there I shall come to see you every fine day. Grandmama, who is\r\n    coming with me, is looking forward to the trip too. But just\r\n    think, Miss Rottenmeier does not want to go. When grandmama\r\n    urges her, she always declines politely. I think Sebastian must\r\n    have given her such a terrible description of the high rocks and\r\n    fearful abysses, that she is afraid. I think he told her that it\r\n    was not safe for anybody, and that only goats could climb such\r\n    dreadful heights. She used to be so eager to go to Switzerland,\r\n    but now neither Tinette nor she wants to take the risk. I can\r\n    hardly wait to see you again!\r\n\r\n    Good-bye, dear Heidi, with much love from grandmama,\r\n\r\n                    I am your true friend,\r\n                              CLARA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Peter heard this, he swung his rod to right and left. Furiously\r\ndriving the goats before him, he bounded down the hill.\r\n\r\nHeidi visited the grandmother next day, for she had to tell her the\r\ngood news. Sitting up in her corner, the old woman was spinning as\r\nusual. Her face looked sad, for Peter had already announced the near\r\nvisit of Heidi\'s friends, and she dreaded the result.\r\n\r\nAfter having poured out her full heart, Heidi looked at the old woman.\r\n"What is it, grandmother?" said the child. "Are you not glad?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Heidi, I am glad, because you are happy."\r\n\r\n"But, grandmother, you seem so anxious. Do you still think Miss\r\nRottenmeier is coming?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it is nothing. Give me your hand, for I want to be sure that\r\nyou are still here. I suppose it will be for the best, even if I shall\r\nnot live to see the day!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but then I would not care about this coming," said the child.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother had hardly slept all night for thinking of Clara\'s\r\ncoming. Would they take Heidi away from her, now that she was well and\r\nstrong? But for the sake of the child she resolved to be brave.\r\n\r\n"Heidi," she said, "please read me the song that begins with \'God will\r\nsee to it.\'"\r\n\r\nHeidi immediately did as she was told; she knew nearly all the\r\ngrandmother\'s favorite hymns by now and always found them quickly.\r\n\r\n"That does me good, child," the old woman said. Already the expression\r\nof her face seemed happier and less troubled. "Please read it a few\r\ntimes over, child," she entreated.\r\n\r\nThus evening came, and when Heidi wandered homewards, one twinkling\r\nstar after another appeared in the sky. Heidi stood still every few\r\nminutes, looking up to the firmament in wonder. When she arrived home,\r\nher grandfather also was looking up to the stars, murmuring to\r\nhimself: "What a wonderful month!--one day clearer than the other.\r\nThe herbs will be fine and strong this year."\r\n\r\nThe blossom month had passed, and June, with the long, long days, had\r\ncome. Quantities of flowers were blooming everywhere, filling the air\r\nwith perfume. The month was nearing its end, when one morning Heidi\r\ncame running out of the hut, where she had already completed her\r\nduties. Suddenly she screamed so loud that the grandfather hurriedly\r\ncame out to see what had happened.\r\n\r\n"Grandfather! Come here! Look, look!"\r\n\r\nA strange procession was winding up the Alm. First marched two men,\r\ncarrying an open sedan chair with a young girl in it, wrapped up in\r\nmany shawls. Then came a stately lady on horseback, who, talking with\r\na young guide beside her, looked eagerly right and left. Then an empty\r\nrolling-chair, carried by a young fellow, was followed by a porter who\r\nhad so many covers, shawls and furs piled up on his basket that they\r\ntowered high above his head.\r\n\r\n"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Heidi in her joy, and soon\r\nthe party had arrived at the top. Great was the happiness of the\r\nchildren at seeing each other again. When grandmama had descended from\r\nher horse, she tenderly greeted Heidi first, and then turned to the\r\nuncle, who had approached the group. The two met like two old friends,\r\nthey had heard so much about each other.\r\n\r\nAfter the first words were exchanged, the grandmother exclaimed: "My\r\ndear uncle, what a wonderful residence you have. Who would have ever\r\nthought it! Kings could envy you here! Oh, how well my Heidi is\r\nlooking, just like a little rose!" she continued, drawing the child\r\nclosely to her side and patting her cheeks. "What glory everywhere!\r\nClara, what do you say to it all?"\r\n\r\nClara, looking about her rapturously, cried: "Oh, how wonderful, how\r\nglorious! I have never dreamt it could be as beautiful as that. Oh\r\ngrandmama, I wish I could stay here!"\r\n\r\nThe uncle had busied himself in the meantime with getting Clara\'s\r\nrolling-chair for her. Then, going up to the girl, he gently lifted\r\nher into her seat. Putting some covers over her knees, he tucked her\r\nfeet in warmly. It seemed as if the grandfather had done nothing else\r\nall his life than nurse lame people.\r\n\r\n"My dear uncle," said the grandmama, surprised, "please tell me where\r\nyou learned that, for I shall send all the nurses I know here\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\nThe uncle smiled faintly, while he replied: "It comes more from care\r\nthan study."\r\n\r\nHis face became sad. Before his eyes had risen bygone times. For that\r\nwas the way he used to care for his poor wounded captain, whom he had\r\nfound in Sicily after a violent battle. He alone had been allowed to\r\nnurse him till his death, and now he would take just as good care of\r\npoor, lame Clara.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara had looked a long time at the cloudless sky above and all\r\nthe rocky crags, she said longingly: "I wish I could walk round the\r\nhut to the fir-trees. If I only could see all the things you told me\r\nso much about!"\r\n\r\nHeidi pushed with all her might, and behold! the chair rolled easily\r\nover the dry grass. When they had come into the little grove, Clara\r\ncould not see her fill of those splendid trees that must have stood\r\nthere so many, many years. Although the people had changed and\r\nvanished, they had remained the same, ever looking down into the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nWhen they passed the empty goat-shed, Clara said pitifully: "Oh\r\ngrandmama, if I could only wait up here for Schwaenli and Baerli! I am\r\nafraid I shan\'t see Peter and his goats, if we have to go away so soon\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Dear child, enjoy now what you can," said the grandmama, who had\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what wonderful flowers!" exclaimed Clara again; "whole bushes of\r\nexquisite, red blossoms. Oh, if I could only pick some of those\r\nbluebells!"\r\n\r\nHeidi, immediately gathering a large bunch, put them in Clara\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Clara, this is really nothing in comparison with the many flowers in\r\nthe pasture. You must come up once and see them. There are so many\r\nthat the ground seems golden with them. If you ever sit down among\r\nthem, you will feel as if you could never get up any more, it is so\r\nbeautiful."\r\n\r\n"Oh, grandmama, do you think I can ever go up there?" Clara asked with\r\na wild longing in her eyes. "If I could only walk with you, Heidi, and\r\nclimb round everywhere!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll push you!" Heidi said for comfort. To show how easy it was, she\r\npushed the chair at such a rate that it would have tumbled down the\r\nmountain, if the grandfather had not stopped it at the last moment.\r\n\r\nIt was time for dinner now. The table was spread near the bench, and\r\nsoon everybody sat down. The grandmother was so overcome by the view\r\nand the delicious wind that fanned her cheek that she remarked: "What\r\na wondrous place this is! I have never seen its like! But what do I\r\nsee?" she continued. "I think you are actually eating your second\r\npiece of cheese, Clara?"\r\n\r\n"Oh grandmama, it tastes better than all the things we get in Ragatz,"\r\nreplied the child, eagerly eating the savory dish.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stop, our mountain wind helps along where the cooking is\r\nfaulty!" contentedly said the old man.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal the uncle and the grandmama had soon got into a lively\r\nconversation. They seemed to agree on many things, and understood each\r\nother like old friends. A little later the grandmama looked over to\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n"We must soon start, Clara, for the sun is already low; our guides\r\nwill be here shortly."\r\n\r\nClara\'s face had become sad, and she entreated: "Oh, please let us\r\nstay here another hour or so. We haven\'t even seen the hut yet. I wish\r\nthe day were twice as long."\r\n\r\nThe grandmama assented to Clara\'s wish to go inside. When the\r\nrolling-chair was found too broad for the door, the uncle quietly\r\nlifted Clara in his strong arms and carried her in. Grandmama was\r\neagerly looking about her, glad to see everything so neat. Then going\r\nup the little ladder to the hay-loft, she discovered Heidi\'s bed. "Is\r\nthat your bed, Heidi? What a delicious perfume! It must be a healthy\r\nplace to sleep," she said, looking out through the window. The\r\ngrandfather, with Clara, was coming up, too, with Heidi following.\r\n\r\nClara was perfectly entranced. "What a lovely place to sleep! Oh,\r\nHeidi, you can look right up to the sky from your bed. What a good\r\nsmell! You can hear the fir-trees roar here, can\'t you? Oh, I never\r\nsaw a more delightful bed-room!"\r\n\r\nThe uncle, looking at the old lady, said now: "I have an idea that it\r\nwould give Clara new strength to stay up here with us a little while.\r\nOf course, I only mean if you did not object. You have brought so many\r\nwraps that we can easily make a soft bed for Clara here. My dear lady,\r\nyou can easily leave the care to me. I\'ll undertake it gladly."\r\n\r\nThe children screamed for joy, and grandmama\'s face was beaming.\r\n\r\n"What a fine man you are!" she burst out. "I was just thinking myself\r\nthat a stay here would strengthen the child, but then I thought of the\r\ncare and trouble for you. And now you have offered to do it, as if it\r\nwas nothing at all. How can I thank you enough, uncle?"\r\n\r\nAfter shaking hands many times, the two prepared Clara\'s bed, which,\r\nthanks to the old lady\'s precautions, was soon so soft that the hay\r\ncould not be felt through at all.\r\n\r\nThe uncle had carried his new patient back to her rolling-chair, and\r\nthere they found her sitting, with Heidi beside her. They were eagerly\r\ntalking of their plans for the coming weeks. When they were told that\r\nClara might stay for a month or so, their faces beamed more than ever.\r\n\r\nThe guide, with the horse, and the carriers of the chair, now\r\nappeared, but the last two were not needed any more and could be sent\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhen the grandmother got ready to leave, Clara called gaily to her:\r\n"Oh grandmama, it won\'t be long, for you must often come and see us."\r\n\r\nWhile the uncle was leading the horse down the steep incline, the\r\ngrandmama told him that she would go back to Ragatz, for the Doerfli\r\nwas too lonely for her. She also promised to come back from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBefore the grandfather had returned, Peter came racing down to the hut\r\nwith all his goats. Seeing Heidi, they ran up to her in haste, and so\r\nClara made the acquaintance of Schwaenli and Baerli and all the others.\r\n\r\nPeter, however, kept away, only sending furious looks at the two\r\ngirls. When they bade him good-night, he only ran away, beating the\r\nair with his stick.\r\n\r\nThe end of the joyous day had come. The two children were both lying\r\nin their beds.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Heidi!" Clara exclaimed, "I can see so many glittering stars, and\r\nI feel as if we were driving in a high carriage straight into the\r\nsky."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and do you know why the stars twinkle so merrily?" inquired\r\nHeidi.\r\n\r\n"No, but tell me."\r\n\r\n"Because they know that God in heaven looks after us mortals and we\r\nnever need to fear. See, they twinkle and show us how to be merry,\r\ntoo. But Clara, we must not forget to pray to God and ask Him to think\r\nof us and keep us safe."\r\n\r\nSitting up in bed, they then said their evening prayer. As soon as\r\nHeidi lay down, she fell asleep. But Clara could not sleep quite yet,\r\nit was too wonderful to see the stars from her bed.\r\n\r\nIn truth she had never seen them before, because in Frankfurt all the\r\nblinds were always down long before the stars came out, and at night\r\nshe had never been outside the house. She could hardly keep her eyes\r\nshut, and had to open them again and again to watch the twinkling,\r\nglistening stars, till her eyes closed at last and she saw two big,\r\nglittering stars in her dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nOF FURTHER EVENTS ON THE ALP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was just rising, and the Alm-Uncle was watching how mountain\r\nand dale awoke to the new day, and the clouds above grew brighter.\r\n\r\nNext, the old man turned to go back into the hut, and softly climbed\r\nthe ladder. Clara, having just a moment ago opened her eyes, looked\r\nabout her in amazement. Bright sunbeams danced on her bed. Where was\r\nshe? But soon she discovered her sleeping friend, and heard the\r\ngrandfather\'s cheery voice:\r\n\r\n"How did you sleep? Not tired?"\r\n\r\nClara, feeling fresh and rested, said that she had never slept better\r\nin all her life. Heidi was soon awake, too, and lost no time in coming\r\ndown to join Clara, who was already sitting in the sun.\r\n\r\nA cool morning breeze fanned their cheeks, and the spicy fragrance\r\nfrom the fir-trees filled their lungs with every breath. Clara had\r\nnever experienced such well-being in all her life. She had never\r\nbreathed such pure, cool morning air and never felt such warm,\r\ndelicious sunshine on her feet and hands. It surpassed all her\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Heidi, I wish I could always stay up here with you!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Now you can see that everything is as beautiful as I told you," Heidi\r\nreplied triumphantly. "Up on the Alp with grandfather is the loveliest\r\nspot in all the world."\r\n\r\nThe grandfather was just coming out of the shed with two full bowls of\r\nsteaming, snow-white milk. Handing one to each of the children, he\r\nsaid to Clara: "This will do you good, little girl. It comes from\r\nSchwaenli and will give you strength. To your health! Just drink it!"\r\nhe said encouragingly, for Clara had hesitated a little. But when she\r\nsaw that Heidi\'s bowl was nearly empty already, she also drank\r\nwithout even stopping. Oh, how good it was! It tasted like cinnamon\r\nand sugar.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll take two tomorrow," said the grandfather.\r\n\r\nAfter their breakfast, Peter arrived. While the goats were rushing up\r\nto Heidi, bleating loudly, the grandfather took the boy aside.\r\n\r\n"Just listen, and do what I tell you," he said. "From now on you must\r\nlet Schwaenli go wherever she likes. She knows where to get the richest\r\nherbs, and you must follow her, even if she should go higher up than\r\nusual. It won\'t do you any harm to climb a little more, and will do\r\nall the others good. I want the goats to give me splendid milk,\r\nremember. What are you looking at so furiously?"\r\n\r\nPeter was silent, and without more ado started off, still angrily\r\nlooking back now and then. As Heidi had followed a little way, Peter\r\ncalled to her: "You must come along, Heidi, Schwaenli has to be\r\nfollowed everywhere."\r\n\r\n"No, but I can\'t," Heidi called back: "I won\'t be able to come as\r\nlong as Clara is with me. Grandfather has promised, though, to let us\r\ncome up with you once."\r\n\r\nWith those words Heidi returned to Clara, while the goatherd was\r\nhurrying onward, angrily shaking his fists.\r\n\r\nThe children had promised to write a letter to grandmama every day, so\r\nthey immediately started on their task. Heidi brought out her own\r\nlittle three-legged stool, her school-books and her papers, and with\r\nthese on Clara\'s lap they began to write. Clara stopped after nearly\r\nevery sentence, for she had to look around. Oh, how peaceful it was\r\nwith the little gnats dancing in the sun and the rustling of the\r\ntrees! From time to time they could hear the shouting of a shepherd\r\nre-echoed from many rocks.\r\n\r\nThe morning had passed, they knew not how, and dinner was ready. They\r\nagain ate outside, for Clara had to be in the open air all day, if\r\npossible. The afternoon was spent in the cool shadow of the fir-trees.\r\nClara had many things to relate of Frankfurt and all the people that\r\nHeidi knew. It was not long before Peter arrived with his flock, but\r\nwithout even answering the girls\' friendly greeting, he disappeared\r\nwith a grim scowl.\r\n\r\nWhile Schwaenli was being milked in the shed, Clara said:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Heidi, I feel as if I could not wait for my milk. Isn\'t it funny?\r\nAll my life I have only eaten because I had to. Everything always\r\ntasted to me like cod-liver oil, and I have often wished that I should\r\nnever have to eat. And now I am so hungry!"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I know," Heidi replied. She had to think of the days in\r\nFrankfurt when her food seemed to stick in her throat.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the full bowls were brought by the old man, Clara,\r\nseizing hers, eagerly drank the contents in one draught and even\r\nfinished before Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Please, may I have a little more?" she asked, holding out the bowl.\r\n\r\nNodding, much pleased, the grandfather soon refilled it. This time he\r\nalso brought with him a slice of bread and butter for the children.\r\nHe had gone to Maiensass that afternoon to get the butter, and his\r\ntrouble was well rewarded: they enjoyed it as if it had been the\r\nrarest dish.\r\n\r\nThis evening Clara fell asleep the moment she lay down. Two or three\r\ndays passed in this pleasant way. The next brought a surprise. Two\r\nstrong porters came up the Alp, each carrying on his back a fresh,\r\nwhite bed. They also brought a letter from grandmama, in which she\r\nthanked the children for their faithful writing, and told them that\r\nthe beds were meant for them. When they went to sleep that night, they\r\nfound their new beds in exactly the same position as their former ones\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nClara\'s rapture in her new life grew greater every day, and she could\r\nnot write enough of the grandfather\'s kindly care and of Heidi\'s\r\nentertaining stories. She told her grandmama that her first thought in\r\nthe morning always was: "Thank God, I am still in the Alm-hut."\r\n\r\nGrandmama was highly pleased at those reports, and put her projected\r\nvisit off a little while, for she had found the ride pretty tiring.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather took excellent care of his little patient, and no day\r\npassed on which he did not climb around to find the most savory herbs\r\nfor Schwaenli. The little goat thrived so that everybody could see it\r\nin the way her eyes were flashing.\r\n\r\nIt was the third week of Clara\'s stay. Every morning after the\r\ngrandfather had carried her down, he said to her: "Would my Clara try\r\nto stand a little?" Clara always sighed, "Oh, it hurts me so!" but\r\nthough she would cling to him, he made her stand a little longer every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis summer was the finest that had been for years. Day after day the\r\nsun shone on a cloudless sky, and at night it would pour its purple,\r\nrosy light down on the rocks and snow-fields till everything seemed to\r\nglow like fire.\r\n\r\nHeidi had told Clara over and over again of all the flowers on the\r\npasture, of the masses of golden roses and the blue-flowers that\r\ncovered the ground. She had just been telling it again, when a longing\r\nseized her, and jumping up she ran over to her grandfather, who was\r\nbusy carving in the shop.\r\n\r\n"Oh, grandfather," she cried from afar, "won\'t you come with us to the\r\npasture tomorrow? Oh, it\'s so beautiful up there now."\r\n\r\n"All right, I will," he replied; "but tell Clara that she must do\r\nsomething to please me; she must try to stand longer this evening for\r\nme."\r\n\r\nHeidi merrily came running with her message. Of course, Clara\r\npromised, for was it not her greatest wish to go up with Heidi to the\r\npasture! When Peter returned this evening, he heard of the plan for\r\nthe morrow. But for answer Peter only growled, nearly hitting poor\r\nThistlefinch in his anger.\r\n\r\nThe children had just resolved to stay awake all night to talk about\r\nthe coming day, when their conversation suddenly ceased and they were\r\nboth peacefully slumbering. In her dreams Clara saw before her a field\r\nthat was thickly strewn with light-blue flowers, while Heidi heard the\r\neagle scream to her from above, "Come, come, come!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nSOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day dawned cloudless and fair. The grandfather was still with\r\nthe children, when Peter came climbing up; his goats kept at a good\r\ndistance from him, to evade the rod, which was striking right and\r\nleft. The truth was that the boy was terribly embittered and angry by\r\nthe changes that had come. When he passed the hut in the morning,\r\nHeidi was always busy with the strange child, and in the evening it\r\nwas the same. All summer long Heidi had not been up with him a single\r\ntime; it was too much! And to-day she was coming at last, but again in\r\ncompany with this hateful stranger.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: HE WATCHED HIS FALLEN ENEMY TUMBLING DOWNWARDS,\r\n   DOWNWARDS]\r\n\r\nIt was then that Peter noticed the rolling-chair standing near the\r\nhut. After carefully glancing about him, he rushed at the hated\r\nobject and pushed it down the incline. The chair fairly flew away and\r\nhad soon disappeared.\r\n\r\nPeter\'s conscience smote him now, and he raced up the Alp, not daring\r\nto pause till he had reached a blackberry bush. There he could hide,\r\nwhen the uncle might appear. Looking down, he watched his fallen enemy\r\ntumbling downwards, downwards.\r\n\r\nSometimes it was thrown high up into the air, to crash down again the\r\nnext moment harder than ever. Pieces were falling from it right and\r\nleft, and were blown about. Now the stranger would have to travel home\r\nand Heidi would be his again! But Peter had forgotten that a bad deed\r\nalways brings a punishment.\r\n\r\nHeidi just now came out of the hut. The grandfather, with Clara,\r\nfollowed. Heidi at first stood still, and then, running right and\r\nleft, she returned to the old man.\r\n\r\n"What does this mean? Have you rolled the chair away Heidi?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I am just looking for it everywhere, grandfather. You said it was\r\nbeside the shop door," said the child, still hunting for the missing\r\nobject. A strong wind was blowing, which at this moment violently\r\nclosed the shop-door.\r\n\r\n"Grandfather, the wind has done it," exclaimed Heidi eagerly. "Oh\r\ndear! if it has rolled all the way down to the village, it will be too\r\nlate to go to-day. It will take us a long time to fetch it."\r\n\r\n"If it has rolled down there, we shall never get it any more, for it\r\nwill be smashed to pieces," said the old man, looking down and\r\nmeasuring the distance from the corner of the hut.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how it happened," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"What a shame! now I\'ll never be able to go up to the pasture,"\r\nlamented Clara. "I am afraid I\'ll have to go home now. What a pity,\r\nwhat a pity!"\r\n\r\n"You can find a way for her to stay, grandfather, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go up to the pasture to-day, as we have planned. Then we shall\r\nsee what further happens."\r\n\r\nThe children were delighted, and the grandfather lost no time in\r\ngetting ready. First he fetched a pile of covers, and seating Clara on\r\na sunny spot on the dry ground, he got their breakfast.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why Peter is so late to-day," he said, leading his goats out\r\nof the shed. Then, lifting Clara up on one strong arm, he carried the\r\ncovers on the other.\r\n\r\n"Now, march!" he cried. "The goats come with us."\r\n\r\nThat suited Heidi, and with one arm round Schwaenli and the other round\r\nBaerli, she wandered up. Her little companions were so pleased at\r\nhaving her with them again that they nearly crushed her with\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nWhat was their astonishment when, arriving on top, they saw Peter\r\nalready lying on the ground, with his peaceful flock about him.\r\n\r\n"What did you mean by going by us like that? I\'ll teach you!" called\r\nthe uncle to him.\r\n\r\nPeter was frightened, for he knew the voice.\r\n\r\n"Nobody was up yet," the boy retorted.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen the chair?" asked the uncle again.\r\n\r\n"Which?" Peter growled.\r\n\r\nThe uncle said no more. Unfolding the covers, he put Clara down on the\r\ndry grass. Then, when he had been assured of Clara\'s comfort, he got\r\nready to go home. The three were to stay there till his return in the\r\nevening. When dinner time had come, Heidi was to prepare the meal and\r\nsee that Clara got Schwaenli\'s milk.\r\n\r\nThe sky was a deep blue, and the snow on the peaks was glistening. The\r\neagle was floating above the rocky crags. The children felt\r\nwonderfully happy. Now and then one of the goats would come and lie\r\ndown near them. Tender little Snowhopper came oftener than any and\r\nwould rub her head against their shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey had been sitting quietly for a few hours, drinking in the beauty\r\nabout them, when Heidi suddenly began to long for the spot where so\r\nmany flowers grew. In the evening it would be too late to see them,\r\nfor they always shut their little eyes by then.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Clara," she said hesitatingly, "would you be angry if I went away\r\nfrom you a minute and left you alone? I want to see the flowers; But\r\nwait!--" Jumping away, she brought Clara some bunches of fragrant\r\nherbs and put them in her lap. Soon after she returned with little\r\nSnowhopper.\r\n\r\n"So, now you don\'t need to be alone," said Heidi. When Clara had\r\nassured her that it would give her pleasure to be left alone with the\r\ngoats, Heidi started on her walk. Clara slowly handed one leaf after\r\nanother to the little creature; it became more and more confiding, and\r\ncuddling close to the child, ate the herbs out of her hand. It was\r\neasy to see how happy it was to be away from the boisterous big goats,\r\nwhich often annoyed it. Clara felt a sensation of contentment such as\r\nshe had never before experienced. She loved to sit there on the\r\nmountain-side with the confiding little goat by her. A great desire\r\nrose in her heart that hour. She longed to be her own master and be\r\nable to help others instead of being helped by them. Many other\r\nthoughts and ideas rushed through her mind. How would it be to live up\r\nhere in continual sunshine? The world seemed so joyous and wonderful\r\nall of a sudden. Premonitions of future undreamt-of happiness made her\r\nheart beat. Suddenly she threw both arms about the little goat and\r\nsaid: "Oh, little Snowhopper how beautiful it is up here! If I could\r\nalways stay with you!"\r\n\r\nHeidi in the meantime had reached the spot, where, as she had\r\nexpected, the whole ground was covered with yellow rock-roses. Near\r\ntogether in patches the bluebells were nodding gently in the breeze.\r\nBut all the perfume that filled the air came from the modest little\r\nbrown flowers that hid their heads between the golden flower-cups.\r\nHeidi stood enraptured, drawing in the perfumed air.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she turned and ran back to Clara, shouting to her from far:\r\n"Oh, you must come, Clara, it is so lovely there. In the evening it\r\nwon\'t be so fine any more. Don\'t you think I could carry you?"\r\n\r\n"But Heidi," Clara said, "of course you can\'t; you are much smaller\r\nthan I am. Oh, I wish I could walk!"\r\n\r\nHeidi meditated a little. Peter was still lying on the ground. He had\r\nbeen staring down for hours, unable to believe what he saw before him.\r\nHe had destroyed the chair to get rid of the stranger, and there she\r\nwas again, sitting right beside his playmate.\r\n\r\nHeidi now called to him to come down, but as reply he only grumbled:\r\n"Shan\'t come."\r\n\r\n"But you must; come quickly, for I want you to help me. Quickly!"\r\nurged the child.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want to," sounded the reply.\r\n\r\nHeidi hurried up the mountain now and shouted angrily to the boy:\r\n"Peter, if you don\'t come this minute, I shall do something that you\r\nwon\'t like."\r\n\r\nThose words scared Peter, for his conscience was not clear. His deed\r\nhad rejoiced him till this moment, when Heidi seemed to talk as if she\r\nknew it all. What if the grandfather should hear about it! Trembling\r\nwith fear, Peter obeyed.\r\n\r\n"I shall only come if you promise not to do what you said," insisted\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I won\'t. Don\'t be afraid," said Heidi compassionately: "Just\r\ncome along; it isn\'t so hard."\r\n\r\nPeter, on approaching Clara, was told to help raise the lame child\r\nfrom the ground on one side, while Heidi helped on the other. This\r\nwent easily enough, but difficulties soon followed. Clara was not able\r\nto stand alone, and how could they get any further?\r\n\r\n"You must take me round the neck," said Heidi, who had seen what poor\r\nguides they made.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who had never offered his arm to anybody in his life, had to\r\nbe shown how first, before further efforts could be made. But it was\r\ntoo hard. Clara tried to set her feet forward, but got discouraged.\r\n\r\n"Press your feet on the ground more and I am sure it will hurt you\r\nless," suggested Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" said Clara, timidly.\r\n\r\nBut, obeying, she ventured a firmer step and soon another, uttering a\r\nlittle cry as she went.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it really has hurt me less," she said joyfully.\r\n\r\n"Try it again," Heidi urged her. Clara did, and took another step, and\r\nthen another, and another still. Suddenly she cried aloud: "Oh, Heidi,\r\nI can do it. Oh, I really can. Just look! I can take steps, one after\r\nanother."\r\n\r\nHeidi rapturously exclaimed: "Oh, Clara, can you really? Can you walk?\r\nOh, can you take steps now? Oh, if only grandfather would come! Now\r\nyou can walk, Clara, now you can walk," she kept on saying joyfully.\r\n\r\nClara held on tight to the children, but with every new step she\r\nbecame more firm.\r\n\r\n"Now you can come up here every day," cried Heidi. "Now we can walk\r\nwherever we want to and you don\'t have to be pushed in a chair any\r\nmore. Now you\'ll be able to walk all your life. Oh, what joy!"\r\n\r\nClara\'s greatest wish, to be able to be well like other people, had\r\nbeen fulfilled at last. It was not very far to the flowering field.\r\nSoon they reached it and sat down among the wealth of bloom. It was\r\nthe first time that Clara had ever rested on the dry, warm earth. All\r\nabout them the flowers nodded and exhaled their perfume. It was a\r\nscene of exquisite beauty.\r\n\r\nThe two children could hardly grasp this happiness that had come to\r\nthem. It filled their hearts brimming full and made them silent. Peter\r\nalso lay motionless, for he had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nThus the hours flew, and the day was long past noon. Suddenly all the\r\ngoats arrived, for they had been seeking the children. They did not\r\nlike to graze in the flowers, and were glad when Peter awoke with\r\ntheir loud bleating. The poor boy was mightily bewildered, for he had\r\ndreamt that the rolling-chair with the red cushions stood again before\r\nhis eyes. On awaking, he had still seen the golden nails; but soon he\r\ndiscovered that they were nothing but flowers. Remembering his deed,\r\nhe obeyed Heidi\'s instructions willingly.\r\n\r\nWhen they came back to their former place, Heidi lost no time in\r\nsetting out the dinner. The bag was very full to-day, and Heidi\r\nhurried to fulfill her promise to Peter, who with bad conscience had\r\nunderstood her threat differently. She made three heaps of the good\r\nthings, and when Clara and she were through, there was still a lot\r\nleft for the boy. It was too bad that all this treat did not give him\r\nthe usual satisfaction, for something seemed to stick in his throat.\r\n\r\nSoon after their belated dinner, the grandfather was seen climbing up\r\nthe Alp. Heidi ran to meet him, confusedly telling him of the great\r\nevent. The old man\'s face shone at this news. Going over to Clara, he\r\nsaid: "So you have risked it? Now we have won."\r\n\r\nThen picking her up, he put one arm around her waist, and the other\r\none he stretched out as support, and with his help she marched more\r\nfirmly than ever. Heidi jumped and bounded gaily by their side. In all\r\nthis excitement the grandfather did not lose his judgment, and before\r\nlong lifted Clara on his arm to carry her home. He knew that too much\r\nexertion would be dangerous, and rest was needed for the tired girl.\r\n\r\nPeter, arriving in the village late that day, saw a large disputing\r\ncrowd. They were all standing about an interesting object, and\r\neverybody pushed and fought for a chance to get nearest. It was no\r\nother than the chair.\r\n\r\n"I saw it when they carried it up," Peter heard the baker say. "I bet\r\nit was worth at least five hundred francs. I should just like to know\r\nhow it has happened."\r\n\r\n"The wind might have blown it down," remarked Barbara, who was staring\r\nopen-mouthed at the beautiful velvet cushions. "The uncle said so\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"It is a good thing if nobody else has done it," continued the baker.\r\n"When the gentleman from Frankfurt hears what has happened, he\'ll\r\nsurely find out all about it, and I should pity the culprit. I am glad\r\nI haven\'t been up on the Alm for so long, else they might suspect me,\r\nas they would anybody who happened to be up there at the time."\r\n\r\nMany more opinions were uttered, but Peter had heard enough. He\r\nquietly slipped away and went home. What if they should find out he\r\nhad done it? A policeman might arrive any time now and they might take\r\nhim away to prison. Peter\'s hair stood up on end at this alarming\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nHe was so troubled when he came home that he did not answer any\r\nquestions and even refused his dish of potatoes. Hurriedly creeping\r\ninto bed, he groaned.\r\n\r\n"I am sure Peter has eaten sorrel again, and that makes him groan so,"\r\nsaid his mother.\r\n\r\n"You must give him a little more bread in the morning, Brigida. Take a\r\npiece of mine," said the compassionate grandmother.\r\n\r\nWhen Clara and Heidi were lying in their beds that night, glancing up\r\nat the shining stars, Heidi remarked: "Didn\'t you think to-day, Clara,\r\nthat it is fortunate God does not always give us what we pray for\r\nfervently, because He knows of something better?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Heidi?" asked Clara.\r\n\r\n"You see, when I was in Frankfurt I prayed and prayed to come home\r\nagain, and when I couldn\'t, I thought He had forgotten me. But if I\r\nhad gone away so soon you would never have come here and would never\r\nhave got well."\r\n\r\nClara, becoming thoughtful, said: "But, Heidi, then we could not pray\r\nfor anything any more, because we would feel that He always knows of\r\nsomething better."\r\n\r\n"But, Clara, we must pray to God every day to show we don\'t forget\r\nthat all gifts come from Him. Grandmama has told me that God forgets\r\nus if we forget Him. But if some wish remains unfulfilled we must show\r\nour confidence in Him, for he knows best."\r\n\r\n"How did you ever think of that?" asked Clara.\r\n\r\n"Grandmama told me, but I know that it is so. We must thank God to-day\r\nthat He has made you able to walk, Clara."\r\n\r\n"I am glad that you have reminded me, Heidi, for I have nearly\r\nforgotten it in my excitement."\r\n\r\nThe children both prayed and sent their thanks up to heaven for the\r\nrestoration of the invalid.\r\n\r\nNext morning a letter was written to grandmama, inviting her to come\r\nup to the Alp within a week\'s time, for the children had planned to\r\ntake her by surprise. Clara hoped then to be able to walk alone, with\r\nHeidi for her guide.\r\n\r\nThe following days were happier still for Clara. Every morning she\r\nawoke with her heart singing over and over again, "Now I am well! Now\r\nI can walk like other people!"\r\n\r\nShe progressed, and took longer walks every day. Her appetite grew\r\namazingly, and the grandfather had to make larger slices of the bread\r\nand butter that, to his delight, disappeared so rapidly. He had to\r\nfill bowl after bowl of the foaming milk for the hungry children. In\r\nthat way they reached the end of the week that was to bring the\r\ngrandmama.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nPARTING TO MEET AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nA day before her visit the grandmama had sent a letter to announce her\r\ncoming. Peter brought it up with him next morning. The grandfather was\r\nalready before the hut with the children and his merry goats. His face\r\nlooked proud, as he contemplated the rosy faces of the girls and the\r\nshining hair of his two goats.\r\n\r\nPeter, approaching, neared the uncle slowly. As soon as he had\r\ndelivered the letter, he sprang back shyly, looking about him as if he\r\nwas afraid. Then with a leap he started off.\r\n\r\n"I should like to know why Peter behaves like the Big Turk when he is\r\nafraid of the rod," said Heidi, watching his strange behavior.\r\n\r\n"Maybe Peter fears a rod that he deserves," said the old man.\r\n\r\nAll the way Peter was tormented with fear. He could not help thinking\r\nof the policeman who was coming from Frankfurt to fetch him to prison.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy morning for Heidi, who put the hut in order for the\r\nexpected visitor. The time went by quickly, and soon everything was\r\nready to welcome the good grandmama.\r\n\r\nThe grandfather also returned from a walk, on which he had gathered a\r\nglorious bunch of deep-blue gentians. The children, who were sitting\r\non the bench, exclaimed for joy when they saw the glowing flowers.\r\n\r\nHeidi, getting up from time to time to spy down the path, suddenly\r\ndiscovered grandmama, sitting on a white horse and accompanied by two\r\nmen. One of them carried plenty of wraps, for without those the lady\r\ndid not dare to pay such a visit.\r\n\r\nThe party came nearer and nearer, and soon reached the top.\r\n\r\n"What do I see? Clara, what is this? Why are you not sitting in your\r\nchair? How is this possible?" cried the grandmama in alarm,\r\ndismounting hastily. Before she had quite reached the children she\r\nthrew her arms up in great excitement:\r\n\r\n"Clara, is that really you? You have red, round cheeks, my child! I\r\nhardly know you any more!" Grandmama was going to rush at her\r\ngrandchild, when Heidi slipped from the bench, and Clara, taking her\r\narm, they quietly took a little walk. The grandmama was rooted to the\r\nspot from fear. What was this? Upright and firm, Clara walked beside\r\nher friend. When they came back their rosy faces beamed. Rushing\r\ntoward the children, the grandmother hugged them over and over again.\r\n\r\nLooking over to the bench, she beheld the uncle, who sat there\r\nsmiling. Taking Clara\'s arm in hers, she walked over to him,\r\ncontinually venting her delight. When she reached the old man, she\r\ntook both his hands in hers and said:\r\n\r\n"My dear, dear uncle! What have we to thank you for! This is your\r\nwork, your care and nursing--"\r\n\r\n"But our Lord\'s sunshine and mountain air," interrupted the uncle,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\nThen Clara called, "Yes, and also Schwaenli\'s good, delicious milk.\r\nGrandmama, you ought to see how much goat-milk I can drink now; oh, it\r\nis so good!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I can see that from your cheeks," said the grandmama, smiling.\r\n"No, I hardly recognize you any more. You have become broad and round!\r\nI never dreamt that you could get so stout and tall! Oh, Clara, is it\r\nreally true? I cannot look at you enough. But now I must telegraph\r\nyour father to come. I shan\'t tell him anything about you, for it will\r\nbe the greatest joy of all his life. My dear uncle, how are we going\r\nto manage it? Have you sent the men away?"\r\n\r\n"I have, but I can easily send the goatherd."\r\n\r\nSo they decided that Peter should take the message. The uncle\r\nimmediately whistled so loud that it resounded from all sides. Soon\r\nPeter arrived, white with fear, for he thought his doom had come. But\r\nhe only received a paper that was to be carried to the post-office of\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nRelieved for the moment, Peter set out. Now all the happy friends sat\r\ndown round the table, and grandmama was told how the miracle had\r\nhappened. Often the talk was interrupted by exclamations of surprise\r\nfrom grandmama, who still believed it was all a dream. How could this\r\nbe her pale, weak little Clara? The children were in a constant state\r\nof joy, to see how their surprise had worked.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Sesemann, having finished his business in Paris, was\r\nalso preparing a surprise. Without writing his mother he traveled to\r\nRagatz on a sunny summer morning. He had arrived on this very day,\r\nsome hours after his mother\'s departure, and now, taking a carriage,\r\nhe drove to Mayenfeld.\r\n\r\nThe long ascent to the Alp from there seemed very weary and far to\r\nthe traveller. When would he reach the goat-herd\'s hut? There were\r\nmany little roads branching off in several directions, and sometimes\r\nMr. Sesemann doubted if he had taken the right path. But not a soul\r\nwas near, and no sound could be heard except the rustling of the wind\r\nand the hum of little insects. A merry little bird was singing on a\r\nlarch-tree, but nothing more.\r\n\r\nStanding still and cooling his brow, he saw a boy running down the\r\nhill at topmost speed. Mr. Sesemann called to him, but with no\r\nsuccess, for the boy kept at a shy distance.\r\n\r\n"Now, my boy, can\'t you tell me if I am on the right path to the hut\r\nwhere Heidi lives and the people from Frankfurt are staying?"\r\n\r\nA dull sound of terror was the only reply. Peter shot off and rushed\r\nhead over heels down the mountain-side, turning wild somersaults on\r\nhis perilous way. His course resembled the course his enemy had taken\r\nsome days ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER SHOT OFF AND RUSHED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE,\r\nTURNING WILD SOMERSAULTS ON HIS PERILOUS WAY]\r\n\r\n"What a funny, bashful mountaineer!" Mr. Sesemann remarked to himself,\r\nthinking that the appearance of a stranger had upset this simple son\r\nof the Alps. After watching the downward course of the boy a little\r\nwhile, he soon proceeded on his way.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the greatest effort, Peter could not stop himself, and\r\nkept rolling on. But his fright and terror were still more terrible\r\nthan his bumps and blows. This stranger was the policeman, that was a\r\ncertain fact! At last, being thrown against a bush, he clutched it\r\nwildly.\r\n\r\n"Good, here\'s another one!" a voice near Peter said. "I wonder who is\r\ngoing to be pushed down tomorrow, looking like a half-open\r\npotato-bag?" The village baker was making fun of him. For a little\r\nrest after his weary work, he had quietly watched the boy.\r\n\r\nPeter regained his feet and slunk away. How did the baker know the\r\nchair had been pushed? He longed to go home to bed and hide, for there\r\nalone he felt safe. But he had to go up to the goats, and the uncle\r\nhad clearly told him to come back as quickly as he could. Groaning, he\r\nlimped away up to the Alp. How could he run now, with his fear and all\r\nhis poor, sore limbs?\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann had reached the hut soon after meeting Peter, and felt\r\nreassured. Climbing further, with renewed courage, he at last saw his\r\ngoal before him, but not without long and weary exertion. He saw the\r\nAlm-hut above him, and the swaying fir-trees. Mr. Sesemann eagerly\r\nhurried to encounter his beloved child. They had seen him long ago\r\nfrom the hut, and a treat was prepared for him that he never\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nAs he made the last steps, he saw two forms coming towards him. A tall\r\ngirl, with light hair and rosy face, was leaning on Heidi, whose dark\r\neyes sparkled with keen delight. Mr. Sesemann stopped short, staring\r\nat this vision. Suddenly big tears rushed from his eyes, for this\r\nshape before him recalled sweet memories. Clara\'s mother had looked\r\nexactly like this fair maiden. Mr. Sesemann at this moment did not\r\nknow if he was awake or dreaming.\r\n\r\n"Papa, don\'t you know me any more?" Clara called with beaming eyes.\r\n"Have I changed so much?"\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann rushed up to her, folding her in his arms. "Yes, you\r\n_have_ changed. How is it possible? Is it really true? Is it really\r\nyou, Clara?" asked the over-joyed father, embracing her again and\r\nagain, and then gazing at her, as she stood tall and firm by his side.\r\n\r\nHis mother joined them now, for she wanted to see the happiness of her\r\nson.\r\n\r\n"What do you say to this, my son? Isn\'t our surprise finer than\r\nyours?" she greeted him. "But come over to our benefactor now,--I mean\r\nthe uncle."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, I also must greet our little Heidi," said the gentleman,\r\nshaking Heidi\'s hand. "Well? Always fresh and happy on the mountain? I\r\nguess I don\'t need to ask, for no Alpine rose can look more blooming.\r\nAh, child, what joy this is to me!"\r\n\r\nWith beaming eyes the child looked at the kind gentleman who had\r\nalways been so good to her. Her heart throbbed in sympathy with his\r\njoy. While the two men, who had at last approached each other, were\r\nconversing, grandmama walked over to the grove. There, under the\r\nfir-trees, another surprise awaited her. A beautiful bunch of\r\nwondrously blue gentians stood as if they had grown there.\r\n\r\n"How exquisite, how wonderful! What a sight!" she exclaimed, clapping\r\nher hands. "Heidi, come here! Have you brought me those? Oh, they are\r\nbeautiful!"\r\n\r\nThe children had joined her, Heidi assuring her that it was another\r\nperson\'s deed.\r\n\r\n"Oh grandmama, up on the pasture it looks just like that," Clara\r\nremarked. "Just guess who brought you the flowers?"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a rustle was heard, and they saw Peter, who was trying\r\nto sneak up behind the trees to avoid the hut. Immediately the old\r\nlady called to him, for she thought that Peter himself had picked the\r\nflowers for her. He must be creeping away out of sheer modesty, the\r\nkind lady thought. To give him his reward, she called:\r\n\r\n"Come here, my boy! don\'t be afraid."\r\n\r\nPetrified with fear, Peter stood still. What had gone before had\r\nrobbed him of his courage. He thought now that all was over with him.\r\nWith his hair standing up on end and his pale face distorted by\r\nanguish, he approached.\r\n\r\n"Come straight to me, boy," the old lady encouraged him. "Now tell me,\r\nboy, if you have done that."\r\n\r\nIn his anxiety, Peter did not see the grandmama\'s finger that pointed\r\nto the flowers. He only saw the uncle standing near the hut, looking\r\nat him penetratingly, and beside him the policeman, the greatest\r\nhorror for him in the world. Trembling in every limb, Peter answered,\r\n"Yes!"\r\n\r\n"Well, but what are you so frightened about?"\r\n\r\n"Because--because it is broken and can never be mended again," Peter\r\nsaid, his knees tottering under him.\r\n\r\nThe grandmama now walked over to the hut: "My dear uncle," she asked\r\nkindly, "is this poor lad out of his mind?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," was the reply; "only the boy was the wind which blew\r\naway the wheel-chair. He is expecting the punishment he well\r\ndeserves."\r\n\r\nGrandmama was very much surprised, for she vowed that Peter looked far\r\nfrom wicked. Why should he have destroyed the chair? The uncle told\r\nher that he had noticed many signs of anger in the boy since Clara\'s\r\nadvent on the Alp. He assured her that he had suspected the boy from\r\nthe beginning.\r\n\r\n"My dear uncle," the old lady said with animation, "we must not punish\r\nhim further. We must be just. It was very hard on him when Clara\r\nrobbed him of Heidi, who is and was his greatest treasure. When he had\r\nto sit alone day after day, it roused him to a passion which drove him\r\nto this wicked deed. It was rather foolish, but we all get so when we\r\nget angry."\r\n\r\nThe lady walked over to the boy again, who was still quivering with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nSitting down on the bench, she began:\r\n\r\n"Come, Peter, I\'ll tell you something. Stop trembling and listen. You\r\npushed the chair down, to destroy it. You knew very well that it was\r\nwicked and deserved punishment. You tried very hard to conceal it, did\r\nyou not? But if somebody thinks that nobody knows about a wicked deed,\r\nhe is wrong; God always knows it. As soon as He finds that a man is\r\ntrying to conceal an evil he has done, He wakens a little watchman in\r\nhis heart, who keeps on pricking the person with a thorn till all his\r\nrest is gone. He keeps on calling to the evildoer: \'Now you\'ll be\r\nfound out! Now your punishment is near!\'--His joy has flown, for fear\r\nand terror take its place. Have you not just had such an experience,\r\nPeter?"\r\n\r\nPeter nodded, all contrite. He certainly had experienced this.\r\n\r\n"You have made a mistake," the grandmama continued, "by thinking that\r\nyou would hurt Clara by destroying her chair. It has so happened that\r\nwhat you have done has been the greatest good for her. She would\r\nprobably never have tried to walk, if her chair had been there. If she\r\nshould stay here, she might even go up to the pasture every single\r\nday. Do you see, Peter? God can turn a misdeed to the good of the\r\ninjured person and bring trouble on the offender. Have you understood\r\nme, Peter? Remember the little watchman when you long to do a wicked\r\ndeed again. Will you do that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall," Peter replied, still fearing the policeman, who had\r\nnot left yet.\r\n\r\n"So now that matter is all settled," said the old lady in conclusion.\r\n"Now tell me if you have a wish, my boy, for I am going to give you\r\nsomething by which to remember your friends from Frankfurt. What is\r\nit? What would you like to have?"\r\n\r\nPeter, lifting his head, stared at the grandmama with round,\r\nastonished eyes. He was confused by this sudden change of prospect.\r\n\r\nBeing again urged to utter a wish, he saw at last that he was saved\r\nfrom the power of the terrible man. He felt as if the most crushing\r\nload had fallen off him. He knew now that it was better to confess at\r\nonce, when something had gone wrong, so he said: "I have also lost the\r\npaper."\r\n\r\nReflecting a while, the grandmama understood and said: "That is right.\r\nAlways confess what is wrong, then it can be settled. And now, what\r\nwould you like to have?"\r\n\r\nSo Peter could choose everything in the world he wished. His brain got\r\ndizzy. He saw before him all the wonderful things in the fair in\r\nMayenfeld. He had often stood there for hours, looking at the pretty\r\nred whistles and the little knives; unfortunately Peter had never\r\npossessed more than half what those objects cost.\r\n\r\nHe stood thinking, not able to decide, when a bright thought struck\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Ten pennies," said Peter with decision.\r\n\r\n"That certainly is not too much," the old lady said with a smile,\r\ntaking out of her pocket a big, round thaler, on top of which she\r\nlaid twenty pennies. "Now I\'ll explain this to you. Here you have as\r\nmany times ten pennies as there are weeks in the year. You\'ll be able\r\nto spend one every Sunday through the year."\r\n\r\n"All my life?" Peter asked quite innocently.\r\n\r\nThe grandmama began to laugh so heartily at this that the two men came\r\nover to join her.\r\n\r\nLaughingly she said: "You shall have it my boy; I will put it in my\r\nwill and then you will do the same, my son. Listen! Peter the goatherd\r\nshall have a ten-penny piece weekly as long as he lives."\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann nodded.\r\n\r\nPeter, looking at his gift, said solemnly: "God be thanked!" Jumping\r\nand bounding, he ran away. His heart was so light that he felt he\r\ncould fly.\r\n\r\nA little later the whole party sat round the table holding a merry\r\nfeast. After dinner, Clara, who was lively as never before, said to\r\nher father:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Papa, if you only knew all the things grandfather did for me. It\r\nwould take many days to tell you; I shall never forget them all my\r\nlife. Oh, if we could please him only half as much as what he did for\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"It is my greatest wish, too, dear child," said her father; "I have\r\nbeen trying to think of something all the time. We have to show our\r\ngratitude in some way."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Mr. Sesemann walked over to the old man, and began: "My\r\ndear friend, may I say one word to you. I am sure you believe me when\r\nI tell you that I have not known any real joy for years. What was my\r\nwealth to me when I could not cure my child and make her happy! With\r\nthe help of the Lord you have made her well. You have given her a new\r\nlife. Please tell me how to show my gratitude to you. I know I shall\r\nnever be able to repay you, but what is in my power I shall do. Have\r\nyou any request to make? Please let me know."\r\n\r\nThe uncle had listened quietly and had looked at the happy father.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Sesemann, you can be sure that I also am repaid by the great joy\r\nI experience at the recovery of Clara," said the uncle firmly. "I\r\nthank you for your kind offer, Mr. Sesemann. As long as I live I have\r\nenough for me and the child. But I have one wish. If this could be\r\nfulfilled, my life would be free of care."\r\n\r\n"Speak, my dear friend," urged Clara\'s father.\r\n\r\n"I am old," continued the uncle, "and shall not live many years. When\r\nI die I cannot leave Heidi anything. The child has no relations except\r\none, who even might try to take advantage of her if she could. If you\r\nwould give me the assurance, Mr. Sesemann, that Heidi will never be\r\nobliged to go into the world and earn her bread, you would amply repay\r\nme for what I was able to do for you and Clara."\r\n\r\n"My dear friend, there is no question of that," began Mr. Sesemann;\r\n"the child belongs to us! I promise at once that we shall look after\r\nher so that there will not be any need of her ever earning her bread.\r\nWe all know that she is not fashioned for a life among strangers.\r\nNevertheless, she has made some true friends, and one of them will be\r\nhere very shortly. Dr. Classen is just now completing his last\r\nbusiness in Frankfurt. He intends to take your advice and live here.\r\nHe has never felt so happy as with you and Heidi. The child will have\r\ntwo protectors near her, and I hope with God\'s will, that they may be\r\nspared a long, long time."\r\n\r\n"And may it be God\'s will!" added the grandmama, who with Heidi had\r\njoined them, shaking the uncle tenderly by the hand. Putting her arms\r\naround the child, she said: "Heidi, I want to know if you also have a\r\nwish?"\r\n\r\n"Yes indeed, I have," said Heidi, pleased.\r\n\r\n"Tell me what it is, child!"\r\n\r\n"I should like to have my bed from Frankfurt with the three high\r\npillows and the thick, warm cover. Then grandmother will be able to\r\nkeep warm and won\'t have to wear her shawl in bed. Oh, I\'ll be so\r\nhappy when she won\'t have to lie with her head lower than her heels,\r\nhardly able to breathe!"\r\n\r\nHeidi had said all this in one breath, she was so eager.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, I had nearly forgotten what I meant to do. I am so glad you\r\nhave reminded me, Heidi. If God sends us happiness we must think of\r\nthose who have many privations. I shall telegraph immediately for the\r\nbed, and if Miss Rottenmeier sends it off at once, it can be here in\r\ntwo days. I hope the poor blind grandmother will sleep better when it\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\nHeidi, in her happiness, could hardly wait to bring the old woman the\r\ngood news. Soon it was resolved that everybody should visit the\r\ngrandmother, who had been left alone so long. Before starting,\r\nhowever, Mr. Sesemann revealed his plans. He proposed to travel\r\nthrough Switzerland with his mother and Clara. He would spend the\r\nnight in the village, so as to fetch Clara from the Alm next morning\r\nfor the journey. From there they would go first to Ragatz and then\r\nfurther. The telegram was to be mailed that night.\r\n\r\nClara\'s feelings were divided, for she was sorry to leave the Alp, but\r\nthe prospect of the trip delighted her.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was settled, they all went down, the uncle carrying\r\nClara, who could not have risked the lengthy walk. All the way down\r\nHeidi told the old lady of her friends in the hut; the cold they had\r\nto bear in winter and the little food they had.\r\n\r\nBrigida was just hanging up Peter\'s shirt to dry, when the whole\r\ncompany arrived. Rushing into the house, she called to her mother:\r\n"Now they are all going away. Uncle is going, too, carrying the lame\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"Oh, must it really be?" sighed the grandmother. "Have you seen\r\nwhether they took Heidi away? Oh, if she only could give me her hand\r\nonce more! Oh, I long to hear her voice once more!"\r\n\r\nThe same moment the door was flung open and Heidi held her tight.\r\n\r\n"Grandmother, just think. My bed with the three pillows and the thick\r\ncover is coming from Frankfurt. Grandmama has said that it will be\r\nhere in two days."\r\n\r\nHeidi thought that grandmother would be beside herself with joy, but\r\nthe old woman, smiling sadly, said:\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a good lady she must be! I know I ought to be glad she is\r\ntaking you with her, Heidi, but I don\'t think I shall survive it\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"But nobody has said so," the grandmama, who had overheard those\r\nwords, said kindly. Pressing the old woman\'s hand, she continued: "It\r\nis out of the question. Heidi will stay with you and make you happy.\r\nTo see Heidi again, we will come up every year to the Alm, for we have\r\nmany reasons to thank the Lord there."\r\n\r\nImmediately the face of the grandmother lighted up, and she cried\r\ntears of joy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what wonderful things God is doing for me!" said the grandmother,\r\ndeeply touched. "How good people are to trouble themselves about such\r\na poor old woman as I. Nothing in this world strengthens the belief in\r\na good Father in Heaven more than this mercy and kindness shown to a\r\npoor, useless little woman, like me."\r\n\r\n"My dear grandmother," said Mrs. Sesemann, "before God in Heaven we\r\nare all equally miserable and poor; woe to us, if He should forget\r\nus!--But now we must say good-bye; next year we shall come to see you\r\njust as soon as we come up the Alp. We shall never forget you!" With\r\nthat, Mrs. Sesemann shook her hand. It was some time before she was\r\nallowed to leave, however, because the grandmother thanked her over\r\nand over again, and invoked all Heaven\'s blessings on her and her\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMr. Sesemann and his mother went on down, while Clara was carried up\r\nto spend her last night in the hut.\r\n\r\nNext morning, Clara shed hot tears at parting from the beloved place,\r\nwhere such gladness had been hers. Heidi consoled her with plans for\r\nthe coming summer, that was to be even more happy than this one had\r\nbeen. Mr. Sesemann then arrived, and a few last parting words were\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nClara, half crying, suddenly said: "Please give my love to Peter and\r\nthe goats, Heidi! Please greet Schwaenli especially from me, for she\r\nhas helped a great deal in making me well. What could I give her?"\r\n\r\n"You can send her salt, Clara. You know how fond she is of that,"\r\nadvised little Heidi.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I will surely do that," Clara assented. "I\'ll send her a hundred\r\npounds of salt as a remembrance from me."\r\n\r\nIt was time to go now, and Clara was able to ride proudly beside her\r\nfather. Standing on the edge of the slope, Heidi waved her hand, her\r\neyes following Clara till she had disappeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bed has arrived. Grandmother sleeps so well every night now, that\r\nbefore long she will be stronger than ever. Grandmama has not\r\nforgotten the cold winter on the Alp and has sent a great many warm\r\ncovers and shawls to the goatherd\'s hut. Grandmother can wrap herself\r\nup now and will not have to sit shivering in a corner.\r\n\r\nIn the village a large building is in progress. The doctor has arrived\r\nand is living at present in his old quarters. He has taken the uncle\'s\r\nadvice and has bought the old ruins that sheltered Heidi and her\r\ngrandfather the winter before. He is rebuilding for himself the\r\nportion with the fine apartment already mentioned. The other side is\r\nbeing prepared for Heidi and her grandfather. The doctor knows that\r\nhis friend is an independent man and likes to have his own dwelling.\r\nBaerli and Schwaenli, of course, are not forgotten; they will spend the\r\nwinter in a good solid stable that is being built for them.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the Alm-Uncle become better friends every day. When\r\nthey overlook the progress of the building, they generally come to\r\nspeak of Heidi. They both look forward to the time when they will be\r\nable to move into the house with their merry charge. They have agreed\r\nto share together the pleasure and responsibility that Heidi brings\r\nthem. The uncle\'s heart is filled with gratitude too deep for any\r\nwords when the doctor tells him that he will make ample provision for\r\nthe child. Now her grandfather\'s heart is free of care, for if he is\r\ncalled away, another father will take care of Heidi and love her in\r\nhis stead.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when our story closes, Heidi and Peter are sitting in\r\ngrandmother\'s hut. The little girl has so many interesting things to\r\nrelate and Peter is trying so hard not to miss anything, that in their\r\neagerness they are not aware that they are near the happy\r\ngrandmother\'s chair. All summer long they have hardly met, and very\r\nmany wonderful things have happened. They are all glad at being\r\ntogether again, and it is hard to tell who is the happiest of the\r\ngroup. I think Brigida\'s face is more radiant than any, for Heidi has\r\njust told her the story of the perpetual ten-penny piece. Finally the\r\ngrandmother says: "Heidi, please read me a song of thanksgiving and\r\npraise. I feel that I must praise and thank the Lord for the blessings\r\nHe has brought to us all!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: (Heidi)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: (Peter)]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    | Page 227: freindly replaced with friendly                 |\r\n    | Page 251: tham replaced with than                         |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    | In this edition, the poem on page 246, is missing the     |\r\n    | lines for G, H, I, J, and K.                              |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Heidi, by Johanna Spyri\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HEIDI ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 20781.txt or 20781.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/7/8/20781/\r\n\r\nProduced by Jason Isbell, Emma Morgan Isbell, Jeannie Howse\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\r\nhttps://www.pgdp.net.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
